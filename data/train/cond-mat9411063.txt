    "a hallmark of mesoscopic systems is the presence of permanent current upon application of an external flux @xcite .",
    "although a noninteracting electron theory is quite successful in describing qualitatively the features of such an effect , it strongly underestimates the magnitude of the observed permanent currents compared to the observed experimental values @xcite .",
    "one possible way out of this discrepancy would be to include the electron - electron interactions .",
    "in general the combined study of disorder and interactions proves difficult to tackle , so that one has to resort to various approximations . in three dimensions hartree - fock - like calculations @xcite tend to suggest that permanent currents are enhanced by the interactions .",
    "arguments based on level statistics reach the same conclusions @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "on the other hand , numerical and analytical techniques alike allow to treat the interactions exactly enough so that firm results can be obtained .",
    "surprisingly , however , various independent calculations performed on a spinless hubbard model with nearest neighbor interactions @xcite or long range coulomb interactions @xcite have reached the opposite conclusion , namely that repulsive interactions are detrimental to permanent currents , which , therefore , casts doubts on the validity of the approximate calculations in higher dimensions .",
    "we here consider the full problem of interacting electrons with spin , in the presence of disorder , and examine the permanent currents in such a system .",
    "we will mainly concentrate for the sake of simplicity on a purely local interaction ( hubbard model ) , but will also consider briefly finite range interactions .",
    "the interactions are treated exactly and we use a renormalization group calculation @xcite to take care of the disorder .",
    "we show analytically that the permanent currents are * enhanced * by the presence of repulsive interactions , and that the result of the spinless model , although correct , was an artifact . as a byproduct of the study we also give a very simple formulation of the bethe - ansatz equations for the pure attractive hubbard model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ meissner ] relates the so called charge stiffness to the permanent currents , and discusses various peculiarities that can occur for finite temperature .",
    "section  [ shubbard ] introduces the model and treats the interactions using the bosonization procedure .",
    "this section is merely to fix the notations .",
    "section  [ currents ] computes the stiffness using a renormalization group calculation .",
    "section  [ bansatz ] focuses on the case of attractive interactions , both with a large @xmath1 expansion and using bethe ansatz , and section  [ longrange ] examines an extended ( nearest neighbors ) hubbard model .",
    "finally the conclusions of our study can be found in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "instead of computing the permanent currents it is simpler to focus on the so - called conductivity stiffness @xmath2@xcite , which measures the strength of the drude peak in a macroscopic system @xmath3 .",
    "the stiffness @xmath2 can be related to the change of the energy of the ground state of the system in presence of an external flux by @xmath4 @xmath5 being the ground state energy of a ring in a field . here",
    "@xmath6 denotes the boundary angle @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flux threading the ring and @xmath9 is the flux quantum . on the other hand , for a mesoscopic system , the permanent current measures the response to a finite flux by @xmath10 therefore the stiffness @xmath2 provides a measure of the permanent currents for small ( or close to a multiple of @xmath11 ) flux since @xmath12 . although the complete calculation of the permanent currents at finite flux is also possible for a one dimensional interacting system , the calculation is more complicated in the presence of disorder , and the stiffness carries enough information for our present purposes .    in order to compute the permanent currents , one should in principle distinguish between an odd and even number of electrons , assumed spinless for the present argument . for an odd number of electrons the energy is minimum in zero external flux , and the number of right and left moving electrons",
    "is equal . for an even number of electrons , due to the @xmath13 state , the number of right and left moving electrons can not be equal , and the energy is not minimum at zero flux . if one has non - disordered noninteracting electrons , it is obvious that in that case the minimum of the energy corresponds to half a flux quantum .",
    "an external flux can be incorporated in the wave function by making the usual gauge transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vector potential .",
    "this transformation modifies the kinetic energy term and absorbs an external flux at the cost of a twist in boundary conditions .",
    "since this transformation is purely local and the interactions and disorder do depend on density only , it will not affect the interaction and disorder terms .",
    "therefore the permanent currents for a system with an even number of electrons , even in the presence of disorder and interactions , will be identical to those of a system with an odd number of electrons , with a shift corresponding to half a flux quantum . in the calculation of the stiffness one",
    "implicitly assumes that the equilibrium state is a minimum of energy with zero current ( equal number of right and left carriers ) .",
    "therefore the stiffness for the case of an even number of electrons , measures the permanent current produced as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the above connection between the permanent currents and the stiffness is valid only at zero temperature . at finite temperature",
    "the permanent current is given by the derivative of the free energy .",
    "one could think that the stiffness would be given by the second derivative of the free energy , within the canonical ensemble .",
    "but such a quantity is the so called meissner fraction @xmath17 although both of @xmath18 and @xmath2 are related to the current correlation function , they correspond to different limits .",
    "@xmath18 , being a thermodynamic quantity corresponds to the limit @xmath19 first and then to @xmath20 , whereas @xmath2 which is related to transport corresponds to the limits taken in the reverse order . for finite @xmath21",
    "the two quantities are distinct . for a macroscopic system",
    "@xmath18 measures the superfluid density and will be zero for a non - superfluid system , whereas @xmath2 can be non zero if the system is perfectly conducting but not superconducting ( e.g. free electrons in the absence of impurities ) . if one has a finite system then @xmath18 needs not to be zero even if the system is not superconducting .",
    "in general the meissner fraction is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a state of the system , @xmath24 is the hamiltonian and @xmath25 the energy of the eigenstates .",
    "we have separated out the contribution from the manifold of degenerate states , which are of especial importance for charge transport . in ( [ stiff ] ) the limits",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 do not commute in general .",
    "if one takes the limit @xmath26 first , then @xmath18 tends to zero unless the system is really superconducting , as can be checked by computing explicitly @xmath18 for e.g. free electrons . for a mesoscopic system , where @xmath0 is finite",
    ", @xmath18 will be finite and gives the slope of the permanent currents with the flux @xmath28 .",
    "one now has to distinguish whether we have an odd or even number of electrons , or more generally whether the ground state is not degenerate ( odd number of electrons ) or whether it has a twofold degeneracy ( even number of electrons ) . in the first case , for small enough temperatures , the sums in ( [ stiff ] ) will be dominated by the ground state , other terms being suppressed by factors like @xmath29 , where @xmath30 would be the gap between the ground state and the first excited states .",
    "such a gap remains finite for a systems of finite size .",
    "if the ground state is not degenerate then the average value of the current in zero external flux is zero in the ground state .",
    "one has @xmath31 the last term in ( [ stiff ] ) vanishes and one finds a positive @xmath18 , roughly temperature independent ( dominated by the first term in ( [ stiff ] ) ) .",
    "there is , therefore , a paramagnetic permanent current for small flux .    on the other hand , if the ground state has a twofold degeneracy , which occurs e.g. for the case of an even number of electrons , then in each of the degenerate ground states @xmath32 the current can ( and will in general ) be nonzero @xmath33 in that case ( [ stiff ] ) is dominated by the last term , which gives rise to a curie type behavior , @xmath34 .",
    "there will therefore be a diamagnetic permanent current , with a slope proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "many of these properties are well known for free electrons ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) but the arguments presented here show that they are much more general and rest only on the degeneracy of the ground state and are valid for interacting electrons as well .",
    "only a short derivation will be given here in order to fix the notations . more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us consider for example the discrete 1d hubbard model with @xmath0 sites @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for nearest neighbors .",

    "@xmath51 corresponds to dominant superconducting fluctuations , whereas @xmath52 corresponds to charge- or spin - density wave ( depending on the spin part of the hamiltonian ) dominant fluctuations .    for the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) the various coefficients in ( [ complet ] ) and ( [ free ] )",

    "@xmath57 are the only parameters needed to describe the long range properties and have been computed exactly using bethe - ansatz @xcite . for attractive interactions",
    "there is a gap in the spin sector , and only @xmath58 and @xmath50 are needed to describe the low energy properties of the model .",
    "they can also be computed from bethe ansatz @xcite as will be seen in more details in section  [ bansatz ] .",
    "the charge stiffness @xmath2 can be obtained @xcite from the bosonized hamiltonian ( [ complet ] ) , and is simply given by @xmath59 .",
    "disorder can be added to ( [ complet ] ) by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a random potential . as is well known the forward scattering due to the potential",
    "does not affect the conductivity in one dimension ( see e.g. ) and one can retain only the @xmath63 fourier components of the random potential .",
    "higher fourier components are less effective since they do not scatter electrons on the fermi surface , and do not correspond to low energy processes . a notable exception",

    ", the physics implied by the equations ( [ renorm]-[renormfin ] ) has been studied at length @xcite . as can be seen from ( [ renormfin ] )",
    ", there are two regimes depending on the initial values of @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath30 can scale to zero , the system is in that case delocalized , and as shown in @xcite is dominated by divergent superconducting fluctuations . in the other regime",
    "@xmath30 scales to large values , and the corresponding phase can be identified with a localized phase . in that case",
    "the rg equations break down below a certain length scale that can be identified with the localization length . in the limit where @xmath75 , as can be seen from ( [ renormfin ] ) the localized - delocalized transition occurs when @xmath76 if @xmath77 ( since @xmath78 renormalises to zero and @xmath56 to one ) or @xmath79 if @xmath80 . for a mesoscopic system of size @xmath0",
    ", one can expect the size to play the role of an infra - red cutoff in the rg equations .",
    "when the renormalized cutoff @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 , one can treat the disorder term in perturbation , and the stiffness is therefore simply given by the quadratic part of the hamiltonian , with the renormalized coefficients @xmath83 .",
    "provided the size @xmath0 is smaller than the length at which the equations cease to be valid one can use them to compute the various values of @xmath84 as function of the size @xmath0 of the system , and from that to obtain the stiffness @xmath2 .",
    "such a calculation is similar to the one performed for a macroscopic system to get the exponent @xmath50 @xcite at finite temperatures . in that case",
    "the cutoff is provided by the dephasing length @xmath85 .",
    "the full dependence of the stiffness on the size of the sample needs a numerical integration of the rg equations , but the qualitative features can be understood by looking at the very small disorder limit . in that case",
    "one can neglect the renormalization of @xmath86 in the equation for @xmath30 , which gives @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the initial value of the disorder . here",
    "we focus on the case of the hubbard model . for small",
    "@xmath53 one can use the values of the parameters ( [ param ] ) and one gets @xmath89 therefore the disorder grows more slowly for the repulsive hubbard model than in the attractive one . in the same limit of a very small initial @xmath30 ,",
    "the stiffness is roughly given by @xmath90 the bare stiffness @xmath91 can be considered roughly independent of the interactions if the system is far enough from half filling as can be seen from ( [ param ] ) .",
    "the dependence in @xmath53 comes only from lattice effects @xcite that breaks galilean invariance and are sensitive , for repulsive interactions , only for fillings close to a commensurate filling ( mainly half filling where the pure system would be a mott insulator ) . for attractive interactions the renormalization of the stiffness of the pure system due to interactions will become much more important and",
    "will be discussed in section  [ bansatz ] .",
    "we will ignore in the following the change of the bare stiffness due to the interactions and will only focus on the effects due to the disorder .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ reduc ] ) , the disorder term tends to drastically reduce the stiffness @xmath2 , and this effect will be smaller for the repulsive model than the attractive one and the stiffness ( the permanent currents ) will be * enhanced * by repulsive interactions for a given size and a given disorder",
    ".    for finite disorder one has to numerically integrate the rg equations .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] and is in agreement with the simplified analysis above .",
    "this rather counter - intuitive result can be simply understood with the following argument : with the repulsive hubbard model , the ground state is almost a spin density wave ( with a power - law decay of the correlation functions ) whose density is uniform . such a ground state couples very weakly to non - magnetic impurities as is obvious from ( [ dis ] ) . to couple to disorder ,",
    "one has to distort the spin density wave and make a fluctuation of the density , a process that will cost an energy increasing with @xmath53 .",
    "the disorder effect is therefore very weak , at least if the size of the system is not too big . on the other hand",
    "the attractive hubbard model has a ground state that contains charge density wave fluctuations ( although superconductive fluctuations are the dominant ones ) which can get very easily pinned by impurities .",
    "on such a ground state the disorder will act very efficiently and drastically reduce the stiffness compared to the pure value therefore making the permanent currents smaller .",
    "such an argument is in agreement with higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is to be contrasted with a previously studied spinless model . in that case",
    "both the attractive and repulsive ground state have density fluctuations , and both can be equally well pinned by disorder . since in the attractive case",
    "the superconducting fluctuations tend to screen the disorder , the stiffness increases with attractive interactions . for the interactions to have a beneficent effect on the permanent currents one must necessary",
    "take a realistic model in which the main effect of the interactions will be to homogenize the density as is the case for the hubbard model .",
    "if the interactions are infinitely repulsive , the system becomes equivalent to a model of spinless fermion with a fermi momentum of @xmath47 . in that case , although the @xmath47 component of the disorder is inefficient ( as is also obvious from the fact that it will no more correspond to a process on the new fermi surface ) , one should worry about the @xmath92 component of the disorder .",
    "such a fourier component acts on the free spinless fermion , so that one recovers the stiffness of free electrons in the presence of disorder .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes would need a detailed analysis of the coupling of the @xmath64 component of the charge density to disorder which is way beyond the scope of this paper , but one could naively expect a maximum of the permanent currents for an intermediate value of the interactions .",
    "if the size of the system becomes large enough the disorder will renormalise to large values and the system will be localized .",
    "this is always the case for repulsive interactions . for attractive interactions ,",
    "a localized - delocalized transition is in principle possible ( for @xmath93 ) and the stiffness could saturate to a finite value .",
    "we will show in the following section that for the particular case of the attractive hubbard model , where one has only an on - site attraction , this transition does not occur and the system remains always localized .",
    "let us consider the case of a large negative @xmath53 .",
    "in that case one would naively imagine that the system should delocalize .",
    "in fact a very large on - site attraction can not delocalize , and * increases * the localization ( and therefore decreases the permanent currents ) . in the @xmath94 limit , one can perform a large @xmath95 expansion . only pairs of particles can hop and if one introduces the operators @xmath96 , the attractive hubbard model then becomes a model of hard core bosons with a hopping @xmath97 and a disorder @xmath98 .",
    "the residual interaction between the bosons is also on the scale of @xmath99 .",
    "in fact using the superexchange formulation or degenerate perturbation theory , the model maps on precisely to the 1-d heisenberg antiferromagnet at a fixed magnetization ( related to the density of particles ) , with an exchange energy @xmath100 . by a jordan wigner transformation",
    "this model corresponds to spinless fermion with a narrow bandwidth and with nearest neighbors interaction , in the presence of the old disorder .",
    "such a system is obviously localized , and since the kinetic energy reduces with @xmath95 one expects the localization length to diminish when the attraction is increased .",
    "one can make the statements more quantitative for finite @xmath53 by studying the rg equations in the attractive regime . in that case",
    "it is well known that there is a gap in the spin excitation spectrum and that only the charge sector remains ungapped .",
    "keeping only the charge excitations into account the rg equations become @xcite @xmath101\\delta ( l ) \\label{renormattf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath102 and @xmath103 is a constant of order unity coming from the @xmath104 correlations in the perturbation expansion .",
    "the equations ( [ renorm ] ) can be used at scales above the size @xmath105 of a cooper pair .",
    "this approach will therefore be adapted for reasonably large @xmath53 . for small @xmath53",
    "it will be better to use the equations ( [ renorm]-[renormfin ] ) , the crossover between the two regimes occurring when @xmath106 .    in order to get the stiffness of the disordered system one needs the initial values of @xmath50 and @xmath58 in the absence of disorder as a function of the attraction @xmath53 .",
    "as for the repulsive hubbard model , they can be deduced from the bethe - ansatz solution @xcite .",
    "we will here give a derivation based on an appealing formulation introduced by sutherland ( in the absence of @xmath6 ) involving the formation of cooper pairs which scatter without diffraction .",
    "let the number of particles be @xmath107 , for which case we note the bethe equations for the attractive @xmath53 hubbard model , with energy @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 satisfy the bethe equations @xcite @xmath111\\ ] ] where @xmath112 are integers ( half odd integers ) for m odd ( even ) .",
    "the flux @xmath6 comes in with a factor of @xmath113 due to the charge of the cooper pair .",
    "these equations can also be obtained from the repulsive case @xcite by using a particle hole transformation on the up electrons of a half filled model , the spin excitations then map on to the above equations .",
    "this can be checked explicitly , using the idea of complementary solutions due to woynarovich @xcite , which essentially rests on the recognition that the equations for real @xmath114 in the bethe equations of the repulsive hubbard model are the @xmath0 real zeroes of a polynomial of degree @xmath115 .",
    "hence the residue theorem of cauchy helps in transforming equations involving the real @xmath114 to those over complex @xmath114 .",
    "the complex @xmath114 come in pairs , and are essentially pinned to be @xmath116 , in order to satisfy the growth conditions .",
    "the error involved in writing down the above cooper pair representation is of @xmath117 , with @xmath118 the cooper pair radius .    the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath50 can be obtained by computing the compressibility @xmath119 and the charge stiffness @xmath120 of the pure system from the bethe ansatz ground state energy .",
    "various values of @xmath58 and @xmath50 are plotted in figure  [ figure2 ] together with the stiffness @xmath2 ( for the pure system ) . as can be guessed from the large @xmath53 expansion @xmath121 at large @xmath53 .",
    "the fact that the parameter @xmath50 remains finite shows that the system remains interacting .",
    "one can check that the limiting value of @xmath50 is in agreement with the one obtained for the @xmath122 chain @xcite on which this system maps in the large @xmath53 limit . due to the reduction of the velocity",
    ", the stiffness of the clean system itself goes to zero at large @xmath53 .",
    "conversely to what happened for repulsive interactions where the stiffness of the pure system was nearly interactions independent , there is here a drastic * reduction * of the stiffness when the attraction is increased @xcite .    using equations ( [ renorm ] )",
    "one computes the stiffness in the presence of disorder . here",
    "the main in the decrease of the velocity @xmath58 , which increases the relative strength of the disorder given by the dimensionless parameter ( [ dimensionless ] ) .",
    "some results are shown in figure  [ figure3 ] , where we have normalized the stiffness to its value in the absence of disorder to avoid the trivial effect of renormalization of the bare stiffness by attractive interactions . in agreement with the previous section",
    "the reduction of the stiffness due to disorder becomes more and more important as the attraction @xmath53 is increased .",
    "in order to check the validity of the arguments presented here for a slightly more general model than the hubbard model , we also look at an extended hubbard model with a nearest neighbor interaction @xmath123 defined by @xmath124 in that case , and for small @xmath53 and @xmath123 the various parameters entering the equations are @xmath125 for small @xmath53 and @xmath123 the renormalization of velocities is of second order in @xmath126 and can be neglected . when replaced in equations ( [ renormfin ] ) one",
    "gets @xmath127 if @xmath128 the results are unchanged compared to the case of the pure hubbard model . in order to check whether the physical ideas introduced here on the increase of the permanent current due to repulsive interactions are correct , or whether they are an artifact of the purely local hubbard model , one can consider the artificial limit where @xmath129 and @xmath123 remains finite . note that the model does not boil down in that case to the spinless fermion model since the @xmath123 term still introduces interactions among opposite spins .    in that case the effect of the interaction depends on the filling . for low filling , a repulsive @xmath123 will tend to favor a spin density wave ground state again , whereas an attractive one would tend to pair particles on neighboring sites , giving a modulation of the density .",
    "for large fillings the situation changes : a positive @xmath123 will now tend to favor two particles on the same site , to avoid paying the repulsion , and therefore to give a charge density wave .",
    "an attractive @xmath123 favoring two particles on neighboring site will this time give a spin density wave .",
    "the change between a sdw towards cdw ground state occurs when @xmath130 and as can be seen from ( [ ksigma ] ) this will occur when @xmath131 .",
    "added to this is the competing effect that the more attractive @xmath123 we have , the more there are superconducting fluctuations in the system which tend to reduce the disorder . above quarter filling the two effects go hand in hand and repulsive interactions are detrimental to the stiffness , whereas below quarter filling the two effects will compete . from ( [ renorv ] )",
    "one can see that the point where a repulsive @xmath123 again becomes favorable to the stiffness is @xmath132 .",
    "below this filling , the fluctuations of the density generated by a repulsive @xmath123 are too strong to be balanced by the superconducting fluctuations and a positive @xmath123 will increase the permanent currents .",
    "we have looked in this paper at the stiffness constant of a hubbard model as a function of the size of the system .",
    "the stiffness constant is directly related to the permanent currents in the presence of an external flux by @xmath133 for small flux .",
    "we have shown that both the attractive and repulsive hubbard model are always localized for a macroscopic system regardless of the strength of the interactions .",
    "in fact , using bethe ansatz solution or for large @xmath1 simple perturbation theory , one shows that the localization length decreases for attractive interactions due to the reduction of charge velocity .    for a mesoscopic system ,",
    "the stiffness in the repulsive hubbard model is much less sensitive to disorder than for the attractive one .",
    "therefore the permanent currents are * enhanced * by repulsive interactions .",
    "this surprising result is related to the fact that for the attractive hubbard model the ground state contains strong charge density wave fluctuations that pins easily on the impurities , whereas repulsion favors a uniform density and makes the pinning harder .",
    "this property remains valid for a model with longer range interactions .",
    "in general the effects of the interactions on the permanent currents is controlled by two competing effects .",
    "one is the presence of density fluctuations in the ground state .",
    "the more there will be , the more easily the system will be pinned by disorder and the more the permanent currents will be reduced compared to the pure value . in general repulsive interactions will tend to favor a homogeneous density ( local fluctuations in density will cost an energy increasing with the repulsion ) , and therefore will tend to increase the permanent currents . on the other hand , attractive interactions promote superconducting fluctuations in the system that tend to screen the disorder and therefore tend to increase the permanent currents .",
    "previous studies of one dimensional systems , leading to the conclusion that repulsive interactions reduced permanent currents , were performed on a spinless model .",
    "in such a rather artificial model , the first effect does not occur , since density fluctuations are always present both for attractive and repulsive interactions and therefore repulsive interactions are detrimental to permanent currents . in a more realistic model where the local interactions are",
    "the dominant ones ( interactions in a real system do decrease with distance ! ) , the density effect will dominate and the permanent current are increased .",
    "this study is , strictly speaking , restricted to one - dimensional systems , and a direct comparison of our results with experimental , three - dimensional , rings is not feasible .",
    "it nevertheless suggests that in mesoscopic systems the presence of repulsive interactions can considerably enhance the permanent currents , and confirms in the exactly solvable one - dimensional case , that the increase of the permanent currents is linked to a reduction of the local density fluctuations by the repulsive interactions .",
    "it is therefore tempting to ascribe the discrepancies observed between the measured and the computed ( with a free electron theory ) values of the permanent currents to such an interaction effect , an interpretation compatible with recent perturbative calculations @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank g. montambaux , h. bouchiat and b. reulet for many illuminating discussions ."
