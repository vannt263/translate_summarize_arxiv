    "the two kinds of dynamical symmetries , namely the @xmath174 @xmath175 and @xmath176 @xmath177 dynamical symmetries of the master equation have been explored .",
    "the first dynamical symmetry corresponds to the collective quasi - photon mode , while the second one is the dynamical symmetry for the real photons of the two cavities . according to algebraic dynamics ,",
    "the system is integrable and its analytical solutions have been obtained .",
    "it is found that the system is affected by the environment through the rate operator consisting merely of collective quasi - photon operators and having collective quasi - photon eigen modes which are highly degenerate in terms of the real photon states .",
    "based on the analytical solutions , the decoherence and entanglement properties of the quasi - photon zero mode of the rate operator have been studied in detail , and the surprising finding is that different entangled states can be produced from the disentangled initial states by environment effects in some cases .",
    "the results obtained are useful for the encoding scheme in quantum computation and for the entanglement generation of the 2-qubit and 2-qutrit cavity systems .",
