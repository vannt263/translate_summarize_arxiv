    "rxj0720.4 - 3125 is a nearby , isolated neutron star ( ns ) that was originally discovered with rosat during a systematic survey of the galactic plane ( haberl et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the source exhibits all the common characteristics of the other six rosat ns candidates ( hereafter dim nss , see e.g. treves et al . , 2000 for a review ) : a blackbody - like , soft spectrum with @xmath8  ev ; an exceedingly large x - ray to optical flux ratio ; a low x - ray luminosity , @xmath9 ; a low column density and no evidence for a binary companion .",
    "an optical counterpart has been identified ( motch & haberl , 1998 ; kulkarni & van kerkwijk , 1998 ) .",
    "pulsation associated with the spin period has been observed in four dim nss : rxj0720.4 - 3125 ( @xmath10  s ) , rxj0420.0 - 5022 ( @xmath11  s ) , rxj0806.4 - 4123 ( @xmath12  s ) and rbs1223 ( @xmath13  s ) .",
    "the pulse shape of rxj0720.4 - 3125 is almost sinusoidal ( haberl et al .",
    ", 1997 ; cropper et al . , 2001 ) .    the true nature of the mechanism powering the x - ray emission from dim nss is still unclear .",
    "until a few years ago , these sources were thought to constitute a stand alone class and two mechanisms were proposed for their emission : either accretion from the interstellar medium onto an old neutron star or release of thermal radiation from a younger , cooling object ( see e.g. pavlov et al .",
    ", 1996 ; treves et al . , 2000 ; motch , 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , it has been noted that the period of rxj0720.4 - 3125 is somewhat unusual and falls in the very narrow range in which the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) periods cluster ( @xmath14 s , see e.g. mereghetti , 2000 ) .",
    "this hints at a possible evolutionary link between dim nss , axps , and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs , see e.g. heyl & kulkarni , 1998 ; heyl & hernquist , 1998 ; colpi et al . , 2000 ;",
    "alpar , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "two kind of `` unified '' scenarios have been then proposed . in the first one ,",
    "the common mechanism powering the three classes of objects is dissipation of a decaying , superstrong magnetic field ( @xmath15  g ) . in this case",
    "dim nss represent the descendants of sgrs and axps , and rxj0720.4 - 3125 may be one of the closest old magnetars . alternatively , all three classes may contain neutron stars with lower ( canonical ) magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) endowed by a fossil disk ( alpar , ankay & yazgan , 2001 ; alpar , 2001 ) . in this interpretation , dim nss would be in the propellor phase and would be the progenitors of axps and sgrs , the latter having entered an accretion phase .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < , < , > , > , < \" , ]     as we can see , allowing for a mechanism involving very fast decay , such as the hall cascade , we find that the source is now @xmath17  yr old , and is born with a superstrong field @xmath18",
    "g. such a young age is only marginally compatible with the absence of a remnant and , more important , is not compatible with the low observed x - ray luminosity ( as we compared using not only the standard cooling curves mentioned above , but also some cooling curves kindly provided by geppert & colpi , private communication ; these latter are computed allowing for the extra - heating due to @xmath19-decay from hall cascade and predict larger luminosities than the former , making the discrepancy even higher ) .",
    "underluminous models have been recently presented by kaminker , haensel & yakovlev ( 2001 ) , who accounted for the enhanced neutrino cooling in presence of strong neutron superfluidity .",
    "these solutions may match an age of @xmath20  yrs for rxj0720.4 - 3125 , but , as discussed by the same authors , they must probably be rejected since they fail in the comparison with observational data of a sample of other neutron stars .    on the other hand , both mechanisms involving ambipolar diffusion predict a magnetic field quite stable over the source lifetime and close to the actual value .",
    "accordingly , the predicted age is @xmath21 years in all cases , close to @xmath22 .",
    "below @xmath23  g the cooling curves are not significantly influenced by decay through ambipolar diffusion ( heil & kulkarni , 1998 ) , thus , as in the case of constant @xmath19 discussed above , the scenario is compatible with the observed luminosity .",
    "the larger age is also compatible with the absence of a remnant .    if our conclusions are valid , the connection between dim ins and axps is not so obvious .",
    "rxj0720.4 - 3125 has a strong , but not superstrong , field which is compatible with those of the canonical radio - pulsars which have passed the death line .",
    "on the other hand , having excluded accretion , what mechanism causes an x - ray emission concentrated in a fraction of @xmath24% of the star surface remains a mystery , as well as the related question about the validity of using the observed blackbody temperature to locate the source in the cooling diagram .",
    "the variation of the surface cooling temperature with the latitude predicted so far for strong fields is not large enough and more complicated explanations are required .",
    "we are grateful to mat page for his advice on the maximum likelihood methods , and to darragh odonoghue for pointing us to the raleigh transform , and for the use of his eagle fourier transform code used in the preliminary stages of this work .",
    "we are grateful to monica colpi for lots of useful discussion , to ulrich geppert for providing the cooling curves and to sandro mereghetti for reading the manuscript .",
