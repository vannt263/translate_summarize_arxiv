    "the quantum corrections to the drude conductivity in disordered metals and doped semiconductors are intensively studied since 1980.@xcite two mechanisms lead to these corrections : ( i ) the interference of the electron waves propagating in opposite directions along closed paths ; ( ii ) the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) . these corrections increase with decreasing temperature and/or increasing disorder , and the low temperature transport in 2d systems",
    "is largely determined by those .",
    "recently , two different behaviors of the conductivity of 2d system with decrease of temperature @xmath0 have come to light : ( i ) the conductivity decreases monotonically for one type of systems ; ( ii ) the conductivity decreases at sufficiently high temperature , but reveals surprising growth at low enough temperature for other ones .",
    "@xcite    it is commonly accepted that decrease of the conductivity for the first type of systems results from temperature dependence of the quantum corrections that are negative and logarithmically diverge at @xmath1 .",
    "in such systems the crossover from the weak localization ( wl ) regime , when the corrections are small compared with the drude conductivity , to the strong localization ( sl ) regime is observed .",
    "the role of interference and electron - electron interaction in this crossover is of special interest and attracts much attention in recent years .    as for the second type of the 2d systems ,",
    "no general consensus on the origin of metallic behavior has been reached as yet .",
    "the study of the role of the eei and interference can be useful for understanding the origin of the metallic - like behavior of conductivity in such systems .",
    "the wl - sl crossover was intensively studied in thin metal films .",
    "it is generally assumed that the eei has a crucial role because the interference is suppressed by the strong spin - orbit interaction in metals .",
    "different aspects of the wl - sl crossover were studied in semiconductor 2d structures but there is no conventional view on the role of eei and interference in this crossover up to now . moreover ,",
    "the magnitudes of the eei and interference corrections to the conductivity are not well established experimentally in the wl regime , when theories of the quantum corrections are applicable .",
    "it is especially concerns the eei contribution .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the eei contribute to @xmath2 only . for @xmath3 the correction has the form @xmath4 whereas for @xmath5 it is given by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the momentum relaxation time , @xmath9 is a function of @xmath10@xcite with @xmath11 as the fermi quasimomentum and @xmath12 as the screening parameter , which for 2d case is equal to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the effective bohr radius . for the most",
    "intensively studied si mos - structures , the transition to the case @xmath5 occurs within the actual range of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "it results in complicated magnetic field dependence of the resistance : decreasing at low magnetic field it increases at high ones .",
    "this makes the quantitative interpretation of experimental data difficult .    for electron 2d systems based on gaas ,",
    "in which the electron @xmath15-factor is much smaller than that in si , the condition @xmath16 is fulfilled in wide range of temperature and magnetic field except extremely low temperature or high magnetic field .",

    "is also shown in the figure .",
    "the large scatter of the experimental data shows that there are no reliable data on the contribution of the eei and it is impossible to conclude whether the theory describes the experiment .    from our point of view , before the discussion of the very interesting problem concerning the role of the eei in wl - sl crossover and in the new low temperature metallic phase , it would be essential to acquire reliable data in the wl regime far from the wl - sl crossover .",
    "just this problem our paper is devoted to .",
    "let us discuss what type of semiconductor heterostructures would be the most suitable for quantitative study of the quantum corrections to the conductivity in the 2d systems .",
    "first of all , the drude conductivity @xmath17 should be high : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is mean - free path . in this case",
    "the wl - theory can be applied . on the other hand",
    ", the quantum corrections must not be very small , lest the measurement accuracy restricts the quantitative analysis .",
    "this means that the electron scattering must be strong enough , i.e. , the mobility must not be high",
    ". it should be the single - quantum - well heterostructure with a single subband occupied , as the theories of quantum corrections have been developed mainly for such case .",
    "quantum well should be symmetric in shape .",
    "it allows to eliminate the peculiarities caused by the spin - orbit interaction@xcite and to neglect the spin effects under analysis of experimental data",
    ". it should be the structure with electrons in quantum well only , i.e. with empty doped ( modulation- or @xmath20- ) layer .",
    "it enables one to avoid the shunting of the quantum well .",
    "the role of the carriers in doped layers is not restricted by shunting .",
    "their redistribution within the layers with temperature can lead to the temperature - dependent disorder , and , hence , to additional temperature dependence of the mobility .",
    "@xcite    thus , two types of structures meet these requirements : ( i ) the structures with doped quantum well ; ( ii ) the structures with symmetrically doped barriers and low carrier density , when the fermi level lies significantly lower than any states in doped layers .",
    "exactly these types of structures was studied in this work .",
    "in this section we present the main theoretical results which will be used in the analysis of the experimental data.@xcite these theories are valid when @xmath21 and the quantum corrections to the conductivity are small compared with the drude conductivity .    without an external magnetic field the total quantum correction to conductivity is @xmath22 , \\label{eq011}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the phase - breaking time . the first term in eq .",

    "( [ eq0 ] ) and ( [ eq01 ] ) for @xmath28 , whereas @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to show that the magnetoresistance @xmath30 is parabolic in the form when @xmath31 : @xmath32 so , @xmath33-versus-@xmath34 curves for different temperatures should cross one another at fixed point @xmath35 and the value of @xmath36 should be equal to the drude conductivity.@xcite    the interference correction to the conductivity gives the contributions both to @xmath2 and @xmath37 but their ratio is such that @xmath38 remains unchanged . within the framework of the diffusion approximation , which is valid when @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath41 is described by the well - known expression@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a digamma function , the value of @xmath44 is equal to unity .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the interference correction beyond the diffusion approximation was studied in refs .   .",
    "the analytical expression suitable for fitting of the experimental data was not obtained for this case , however , as is shown in ref .  , eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) also describes the @xmath45-vs-@xmath34 curve well but with prefactor @xmath46 .",

    "( [ eq05 ] ) and ( [ eq07 ] ) that the interference correction gives the strong magnetic field dependence of the resistivity at @xmath47 , whereas the eei does it at magnetic field @xmath48 . since the ratio @xmath49 is equal to @xmath50 , these magnetic field ranges are well separated .",
    "thus , application of magnetic field allows to obtain the interference and interaction contributions to the conductivity separately .    to answer the question ",

    "namely such a behavior is in full agreement with the predictions of the eei theory .",

    "we have analyzed in detail the results obtained for structure 2 .",
    "similar accordance with the theoretical predictions has been observed for structures 1 and 3 .",

    "let us analyze the results for structure 4 .",
    "it is the structure with @xmath20-doped barriers , like structure 3 , but with higher electron density ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . at the first sight the magnetic field dependences of @xmath33 and @xmath148 at different temperatures ( see fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) , but unlike structure 2 , the value of @xmath60 is much greater than @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the significant temperature dependence of @xmath37 is evident at high magnetic field ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "such behavior of @xmath37 is in conflict with the theoretical prediction for the eei correction , but yet if one uses the slope of @xmath2-vs-@xmath122 dependence at high magnetic field for evaluation of the eei contribution , we obtain the value of @xmath94 about @xmath149 that is much greater than that for other structures .",
    "notice , the temperature dependence of @xmath150 at @xmath117 for this structure remains logarithmic , but with the slope about @xmath151 that is essentially greater than the slope for structures @xmath152 : @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath37 at high magnetic field in structure 4 seems to be incomprehensible .",
    "the interference correction does not depend on temperature at @xmath154 .",
    "the eei does not affect @xmath155 . finally ,",
    "the classical part @xmath156 is temperature independent at such strong degeneracy of electron gas ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this structure some fraction of the electrons occupies the states in @xmath20-doped layers in contrast to other structures investigated .",
    "analysis of the magnetic field dependences of @xmath33 and @xmath38 from the point of view of two - types of carriers shows that these electrons do not contribute to the conductivity of the structure .",
    "however , at temperature change the redistribution of the electrons within the @xmath20-layers can lead to the temperature dependent disorder and , hence , to the temperature dependence of the mobility of electrons in the quantum well .",
    "estimations show that as low as 1% increase of the mobility with increasing temperature is enough to cause the temperature dependence of @xmath155 observed experimentally .",

    "the temperature independence of @xmath37 in high magnetic field was demonstrated , and , as seen in figure [ fig1 ] these results accord well with our data .",
