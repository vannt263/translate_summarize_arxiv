    "single - photon detectors are the key components in numerous photonics - related applications such as quantum cryptography  @xcite , optical time domain reflectometry  @xcite and integrated circuit testing  @xcite .",
    "we can classify single - photon detection into four classes : photomultiplier tubes  @xcite ; semiconductor apds  @xcite ; superconducting detectors  @xcite ; and novel proposals such as using a single - electron transistor consisting of a semiconductor quantum dot  @xcite . in the telecommunication regime ( 1550 nm ) , ingaas / inp apds are currently the best choice for practical applications such as quantum cryptography  @xcite due to their favorable characteristics such as cost , size and robust operation with only thermo - electric cooling required .    to detect single photons",
    ", apds must work in the so - called geiger mode in which an inverse bias voltage ( @xmath0 ) , exceeding the breakdown voltage ( @xmath1 ) , is applied , such that even a single photoexcited carrier ( electron - hole pair ) can create a persistent avalanche and a subsequent macroscopic current pulse due to the process of impact ionization .",
    "after the avalanche , a passive or active quenching circuit  @xcite , is used to reduce @xmath0 down to below @xmath1 , output a synchronized pulse and reset the apd for detecting the next photon .",
    "ingaas / inp apds are currently fabricated with separate absorption , charge and multiplication layers  @xcite to ensure the lattice matching and preserve a low electric field in the ingaas absorption layer with a narrower bandgap ( @xmath2ev for in@xmath3ga@xmath4as ) , minimizing the induced leakage currents , while a high electric field in the inp multiplication layer , enhancing the impact ionization effect .",
    "the middle charge layer can efficiently control the electric field profiles of the absorption and multiplication layers .",
    "the parameters of apds are affected by many factors such as the crystalline quality of semiconductor device , imperfections of design and fabrication , quenching circuit , and operational conditions .",
    "therefore , actual performance of these apds is always compromised and optimized for different applications .",
    "in the past decade efforts have been made to characterize and further improve apd performance on the single - photon level at 1550 nm  @xcite .",
    "recently , integration of the quenching electronics for ingaas / inp apds to an asic  @xcite has been implemented .",
    "the measured results on some key parameters of apds demonstrate active quenching asics can efficiently improve the noise - efficiency performance , and it has been shown that these apds can work in a free - running mode  @xcite .",
    "however , full characterization of apds with the asic is still necessary to better understand the improvements they provided . in this paper",
    ", we fully test 4 ingaas / inp apds at 1550 nm with an active quenching asic operating both in the free - running and gated modes , and compare the improvements with conventional electronics .",
    "the schematic setup for testing apds is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . a digital delay pulse generator ( dg535 , stanford research systems inc . ) provides synchronous signals for the whole system .",
    "one of its periodic outputs drives a 1550 nm laser diode ( ld ) to produce short optical pulses with @xmath5ps fwhm .",
    "the optical pulses are split into two parts by a 10/90 asymmetric fiber beamsplitter ( bs ) .",

    "att , iq3100 , exfo co. ) in real - time and stabilize the intensity of the output from the attenuator that goes to the pigtailed apd .",
    "the pins of the apd and asic are soldered together on a small printed circuit board , while the body of apd is fixed on the top of 4-layer thermoelectric cooler and actively stabilized with a closed - loop control .",
    "+    the schematic diagram of the asic , fabricated with a @xmath6 m complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) process , is shown in the gray area of fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the amplitude of the gate signals from the complex programmable logic device ( cpld ) is first converted to the power supply voltage vdd ( @xmath7v ) of the chip .",
    "two pulses are then generated to control the pmos and nmos switches respectively which have extremely fast rise and fall times .",
    "there is a very short delay between the two control pulses to avoid the simultaneous conduction of the two switches .",
    "the timing is such that at the beginning of the gate the pmos switch is closed while the nmos switch is opened , to charge the voltage at the quenching point ( q ) up to vdd , and then the pmos switch is reopened . the total voltage difference between cathode and anode of the apd is @xmath8vdd@xmath9 , exceeding @xmath1 for geiger mode operation .",
    "the nmos switch remains open until the end of the gate if no avalanche happens , or until the active quenching after a triggered avalanche . during the avalanche process ,",
    "current across the apd rapidly increases and results in an increasing voltage drop across the resistor @xmath10 .",
    "the comparator and the following circuit quickly detects the the voltage drop at q and immediately informs the buffer to close the nmos switch to drop the voltage at q to zero , and also generate a synchronous detection output to the cpld .",
    "normally the detector output maintains the high level until the falling edge of the next gate .",
    "actually , when a detection is registered the cpld inserts a short reset pulse after the gate , otherwise the cpld does nothing . in the free - running mode ,",
    "the gates from the cpld are not used and vdd is applied to the cathode of the apd until an avalanche is excited .",
    "further technical description about the asic can be found in ref .",

    "time jitter strongly depends on device fabrication and @xmath13 , corresponding to excess bias ( @xmath29 ) on the apd .",
    "larger @xmath29 can generate higher electric fields , which will shorten the trapping time of the carriers in the absorption and grading layers , and also the buildup time of avalanche , hence reducing the jitter . to measure this",

    "a synchronized signal from a pulse generator is used as the tcspc s `` stop '' while the detection output signal is used as `` start '' .",

    "there are two main mechanisms for the generation of dark carriers : thermal generation ; and tunneling generation .",
    "the thermal generation means that a carrier is transferred from the valence band to the conduction band either directly or via the midgap defects , owing to the thermal excitation .",
    "tunneling generation means that a carrier tunnels between the two bands , or it is trapped by a defect first and then tunnels to the conduction band , which is also called trap - assisted tunneling ( tat )  @xcite .",

    "if there is a click during the detection ( ab ) gate , the cpld will also generate an afterpulse ( cd ) gate after ab s reset pulse with a delay of @xmath55 to the falling edge of the ab gate .",
    "this corresponds to the deadtime .",
    "the cpld also generates a reset pulse for the cd gate only when an afterpulse detection is registered during this gate .",
    "this method directly measures @xmath14 .    assuming a poisson distribution , @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the detrapping rate at time @xmath55 and @xmath58 is the avalanche probability .",

    "the detrapping lifetime can be modeled as  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the trapping activation energy .",

    "nonetheless , we have previously seen that for short deadtimes the afterpulsing dominates @xcite . as we have now been able to use the double - gate method to characterize the afterpulsing , in the gated regime",

    "we underestimate the rates as we do not take account of cascaded afterpulses , i.e. , higher order effects .",
    "the more interesting region , from 20 - 40@xmath21s , we are overestimating due to the difficulty in defining an appropriate integration range , which will also change as a function of the photon flux , the intrinsic detection efficiency and the deadtime .",
    "importantly , we can also conclude that for small @xmath55 , if @xmath78 increases , then the @xmath80 value will decrease , since photon clicks will increase while the multiple afterpulsing effects will be relatively less likely .",
    "our model makes a first attempt to both understand the afterpulsing and to develop a reliable technique for determining the detector s characteristics , without resorting to complicated techniques in a double - gate regime , there is still some way to go .",

    "charge persistence is not normally a problem for synchronous detectors as the photons arrive during the gate .",
    "however , what happens if a photon arrives before the gate is applied , as is possible in the free - running mode , before the apd is activated after a deadtime ?    when the detector is `` off '' , i.e. , at @xmath0 below @xmath1 , with only a few volts so that primary dark carriers can still be generated and multiplied by the average dc gain but with a small probability .",
    "when the gate pulse arrives some of the carriers that remained in the multiplication layer can induce avalanches  @xcite .",
    "this is called `` charge persistence '' ( cp ) , or sometimes referred as the `` twilight effect ''  @xcite .",

    "<S> we present an active quenching application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) , for use in conjunction with ingaas / inp avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) , for 1550 nm single - photon detection . to evaluate its performance , we first compare its operation with that of standard quenching electronics . </S>",
    "<S> we then test 4 ingaas / inp apds using the asic , operating both in the free - running and gated modes , to study more general behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate not only the standard parameters under different working conditions but also parameters such as charge persistence and quenching time . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the multiple trapping model to account for the afterpulsing behavior in the gated mode , and further propose a model to take account of the afterpulsing effects in the free - running mode . </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly indicate that the performance of apds with an on - chip quenching circuit significantly surpasses the conventional quenching electronics , and makes them suitable for practical applications , e.g. , quantum cryptography .    </S>",
