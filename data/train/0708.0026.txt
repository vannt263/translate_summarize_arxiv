    "there is only one physical ( neutral ) higgs boson .",
    "should a charged scalar particle be found , one would have to unravel the underlying physics , as most frameworks beyond sm predict charged higgs bosons . the simplest and the most popular of such models are the two higgs doublet model(s ) and supersymmetric models .",
    "one could distinguish among the `` new higgs '' by testing their charge - parity ( cp ) properties .",

    "the observed direct cp violations in k @xcite and b @xcite decays can be accommodated via the ckm matrix in the sm .",
    "models beyond the sm contain several new sources of cp violation , some of which could affect higgs boson decays .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains many parameters which can in principle be complex , even after making all allowed rotations to get rid of unphysical phases .",
    "such new sources of flavor and cp violation give rise to enhanced cp violation , some of which could provide distinguishing signs for mssm at present and future colliders . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we discussed the cp asymmetry in charged higgs decays @xmath7 in the framework of the mssm , where @xmath8 .",
    "we showed that , although the channels @xmath9 and @xmath10 have sizable cp asymmetry with respect to the channels @xmath11 and @xmath12 , this result has to be taken with caution since the formers have very small branching ratios ( @xmath13 s ) which makes them harder to observe .",
    "we calculated @xmath14 @xcite for each decay mode , which is proportional to the number of required charged higgs bosons produced at colliders is closely related to the total number of events @xmath15 required to establish a measurable cp violation for a particular mode .",
    "the exact formula is @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the standard deviation and @xmath18 is the detection efficiency . ] to observe an asymmetry for a given channel @xcite .",
    "based on this analysis , we concluded that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the the optimal channels which could reveal a measurable cp asymmetry at the order of @xmath21 .    in this study , we calculate the cp asymmetry in charged higgs decays in the purely supersymmetric mode @xmath0 , @xmath22 , compare the size of the cp asymmetry for each @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and evaluate the number of charged higgs needed to observe each asymmetry .",
    "we show that the asymmetry can be very large if we include only constraints requiring supersymmetric particles to have masses consistent with experimental bounds .",
    "however , if we also include low energy phenomenology constraints coming from @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and electric dipole moments , the predicted asymmetry and the allowed parameter space are considerably reduced .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the cp structure of the mssm .",
    "the processes and the method of calculation are outlined in section [ decays ] and the numerical analysis of the decays under consideration are presented in the section [ numerical ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conc ] , and give the relevant analytical expressions in the appendix .",
    "in addition to the cp violation induced by the ckm matrix in the quark charged current , cp phases can be introduced explicitly in the mssm , by complex yukawa couplings of higgs bosons to quarks and squarks .",
    "new supersymmetric - only sources of cp violation in mssm are : the soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino masses @xmath25 ; the bilinear higgsino coupling parameter @xmath26 ; and the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear scalar coupling of the higgs bosons with scalar fermions @xmath27 , @xmath28 . in principle , each of these parameters can have independent cp - phases , making a general analysis of cp violation or asymmetry very complicated .",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that at the unification scale the gaugino masses have a common phase and the trilinear couplings are all equal and have another common phase . in order to avoid known problems with the electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite",
    ", one could deviate from exact universality and consider @xmath29 to be diagonal in flavour space with vanishing first and second generation couplings .",
    "this leaves independent phases in @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , the symmetries of the mssm can be used to re - phase one of the higgs doublet fields and the gaugino fields such that @xmath31 are real @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cp - violating phases associated with the sfermions of the first and second generations are severely constrained by bounds on the edms of the electron , neutron and muon @xcite and this limits @xmath32 , which can not exceed values of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "there have been several proposals @xcite@xcite to evade these constraints without suppressing the cp - violating phases .",
    "one possibility is to arrange for partial cancellations among various contributions to the edms @xcite .",
    "another option is to make the first two generations of scalar fermions rather heavy , of order @xmath34 tev , so that the one - loop edm constraints are automatically avoided .",
    "one could invoke the effective susy models @xcite where decoupling of the first and second generation sfermions are used to solve the susy flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and cp problems without spoiling the naturalness condition .",

    "we then performed a scan of the significant parameter space for maximizing the asymmetry , and correlate it to the number of charged higgs needed to see the corresponding asymmetry shown to be proportional to @xmath160 . in the scan we included the experimental bounds on the masses of supersymmetric particles only , as well as the previously mentioned low energy bounds .",
    "we first note that the inclusion of mass bounds restricts the asymmetry slightly , while the other bounds pose more severe restrictions on the cp asymmetries .",
    "in particular , the edms , thought to restrict parameters in the up and down scalar quark only , impose severe restrictions even on the masses and mixing of the third family of scalar quarks , confirming the expectation that the scalar quark mass parameters must be in the tev region .",
    "heavy scalar quark masses and heavy gluino masses are also needed to satisfy the @xmath131 constraint , while the bounds on @xmath173 and @xmath5 are not as stringent .",
    "our analysis underscores the importance of including these constraints on the parameter space , like in the analysis of top quark production and decays @xcite .    for the allowed regions , the most promising channel appears to be @xmath6 , where both the asymmetry can reach 7% and the number of charged higgs required to observe them is yet the smallest , of order @xmath168 .",
    "this channel may be competitive with the quark channels @xcite .",
    "of course , this is encouraging , as light charginos and neutralinos are most likely to be produced in charged higgs decays in the first place . by comparison ,",
    "the other channels are less promising .",
    "for instance , for heavy chargino - neutralino channel , @xmath119 , almost @xmath169 charged higgs events ( with a branching ratio of the order of @xmath170 ) are required for detecting an asymmetry of ( 8 - 9)% .",
    "this work is supported in part by nserc of canada under the grant no . sap01105354 .",
    "we calculate the absorptive part of the loop diagrams by applying the cutkosky rules . in general , in the loop integration , we end up with a numerator with scalar , vectorial , or tensorial structures ( and their pseudo counterparts ) , depending on the types of particles running in the loop . for a more complete discussion of our method and the cut results for the two - point ( self - energy ) case and three - point ( vertex - type ) scalar case , please see @xcite .",
