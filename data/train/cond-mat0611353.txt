    "we then consider the parameters @xmath201 of the form @xmath217 and the corresponding potential @xmath218 .",

    "the derivative @xmath221 vanishes due to the fixed point conditions at @xmath222 and @xmath223 : @xmath224 .",
    "since @xmath225 is a second degree polynomial , it then has necessarily the form @xmath226 the second derivative @xmath227 is given in terms of the matrix of second partial derivatives of @xmath38 and , thus , the partial derivatives of the @xmath228-functions , by @xmath229 in particular , for @xmath222 and @xmath223 @xmath230 at a stable fixed point , the matrix @xmath231 of partial second derivatives of @xmath38 is positive .",
    "thus , if @xmath232 and @xmath216 are stable fixed points , @xmath233 and @xmath234 are both given by the expectation value of a positive matrix and thus are both positive , which is contradictory : the two fixed points can not both be stable .",
    "more generally , the sign of @xmath233 characterizes , in some sense , the relative stability of these two fixed points .",
    "let us assume , for example , @xmath235 which is consistent with the assumption that @xmath232 is stable .",
    "then @xmath236 in @xmath237 $ ] and @xmath238 is a decreasing function .",
    "thus , @xmath239 in particular , if @xmath215 is a stable fixed point , it corresponds , among all fixed points , to the lowest value of the potential .",
