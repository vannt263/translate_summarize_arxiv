    "there is little pretension to originality ; the main novelty is firstly that we give a new ( and much shorter ) proof of coornaert s theorem on patterson  sullivan measures for hyperbolic groups ( theorem  [ measure_is_conformal ] ) , and secondly that we explain how to combine the results of calegari  fujiwara in @xcite with that of pollicott  sharp @xcite to prove central limit theorems for quite general classes of functions on hyperbolic groups ( corollary  [ distance_clt ] and theorem  [ holder_clt ] ) , crucially _ without _ the hypothesis that the markov graph encoding an automatic structure is ergodic .",

    "the fundamental idea in geometric group theory is to study groups as automorphisms of geometric spaces , and as a special case , to study the group itself ( with its canonical self - action ) as a geometric space .",

    "a metric space is a _ path metric space _ if for each @xmath19 , the distance @xmath20 is equal to the infimum of the set of numbers @xmath21 for which there is a @xmath22-lipschitz map @xmath23 \\to x$ ] sending @xmath24 to @xmath25 and @xmath21 to @xmath26 .",
