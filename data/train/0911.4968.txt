    "we will represent one - dimensional caldern - zygmund convolution operators with sufficiently smooth kernels , see , , by means of a properly chosen averaging of certain haar shift operators with bounded coefficients . by _",
    "haar shift operators , _ we mean for example : linear operators that can be expressed in an efficient manner with the haar basis .",
    "the use of haar shift operators to represent singular integral operators goes back to the work of t.figiel @xcite .",
    "later s.  petermichl derived a strikingly succinct representation of the hilbert transform @xcite .",
    "similar representations were derived for beurling @xcite , riesz @xcite transforms and the truncated hilbert transform ( s. petermichl , oral communication ) .",
    "the reason why these succinct representations are useful is that one can deduce deep facts about singular integral operators , based on the analysis of haar shift operators . in petermichl s original paper @xcite , a deep property of hankel operators associated to matrix symbols was deduced .",
    "the linear @xmath0 bound for the hilbert transform was deduced by petermichl @xcite , as was the same result for the riesz transforms @xcite and the truncated hilbert transform ( s. petermichl , oral communication ) .",
    "the study of the haar shift operators is interesting in itself @xcite , and has become an important model of the singular integral operators , see for instance their use in @xcite .    to illustrate this , as a corollary to our main result , theorem   below , and the main result of @xcite",
    ", we see that we have a proved a sharp @xmath1 inequality for the calderon - zygmund operators , a question of current interest :    let @xmath2 be a one dimensional calderon - zygmund convolution operator whose kernel @xmath3 is odd and satisfies and , then @xmath4 by @xmath5 we mean the @xmath0 constant of the weight @xmath6 .",
    "( see @xcite for a definition . )",
    "this generalizes the result of s. petermichl , obtained for the hilbert transform @xcite , and improves the estimates of a. lerner , s. ombrosi and c. perez @xcite*equation 1.9 for these particular type of calderon - zygmund operators .",
    "in order to formulate the main theorem we introduce some notations . for any @xmath7 and for",
    "any @xmath8 define the dyadic grid @xmath9 to be the collection of intervals @xmath10 this parametrization of dyadic grids appears explicitly in @xcite , and implicitly in @xcite*section 9.1 .",
    "note , that the dyadic grid we use is different from the one used in @xcite .",
    "place the usual uniform probability measure @xmath11 on the space @xmath12 , explicitly @xmath13    we define two functions .",
    "take @xmath14 to be the function supported on @xmath15 $ ] defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be the function supported on @xmath15 $ ] defined by @xmath18 note that the function @xmath17 appears in @xcite paired with the usual haar function .",
    "in contrast , our function @xmath14 , defined by , differs a little bit from the haar function . in some sense , our choice of the function @xmath14 makes the convolution @xmath19",
    "less smooth , and this property will be crucial for the proof .",
    "we ll make this statement precise in , which will permit us to invert a fourier transform .",
    "for any function @xmath20 and any interval @xmath21 $ ] we define the function @xmath22 to be the scaling of @xmath20 to @xmath23 which preserves the @xmath24-norm , namely @xmath25}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt l}f\\left(\\frac{x - a}{l}\\right).\\ ] ]    now we are ready to state our main theorem :    [ t.main ] let @xmath26 be an odd , twice differentiable function ( in the sense that @xmath27 is absolutely continuous ) which satisfies @xmath28 and @xmath29 then there exists a coefficient - function @xmath30 , satisfying @xmath31 so that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is some absolute constant and the series on the right of is a.e . absolutely convergent .",
    "note , that for for fixed @xmath35 , and a function @xmath36 , the linear operator @xmath37 is an example of a haar shift operator as defined in @xcite .",
    "note that this operator , expressed as a matrix in the haar basis , has a bounded diagonals , but is even better than that : one only needs to use haar coefficients associated with dyadic intervals that intersect and have lengths that differ by at most a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "[ l.convolution ] suppose the functions @xmath14 and @xmath17 are defined by , and suppose @xmath39 . then for any @xmath33 , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and the functions @xmath42 are defined by . here",
    "the series on the left of is a.e .",
    "absolutely convergent .          having this lemma at hand ,",
    "the claim of theorem [ t.main ] is equivalent to the following : for @xmath14 and @xmath17 defined by and , find a function @xmath48 which would satisfy the following integral equation @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "the case @xmath51 would be satisfied automatically as both @xmath3 and @xmath52 are odd .        differentiating twice ,",
    "we get @xmath54 or equivalently @xmath55 using the definitions , for @xmath14 and @xmath17 , we see that @xmath56 is a continuous , piecewise linear , odd function .",
    "the graph of @xmath57 on the positive axis is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath58 is a linear combination of dirac measures , which one can calculate from the graph above , in particular @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the usual dirac delta function centered at the point @xmath61 .    with this ,",
    "becomes @xmath62 let s modify to a form , which will be more convenient to us",
    ". denote @xmath63 and @xmath64 in terms of these new notations the equation becomes @xmath65 the condition of theorem [ t.main ] provides that @xmath66 .",
    "we want to find @xmath67 which would solve .",
    "apply fourier transform to both sides of to get @xmath71 where @xmath72 now the function @xmath73 is a fourier transform of a finite borel measure on @xmath74 .",
    "also note the following important property of @xmath73 : our choice of functions @xmath14 and @xmath17 provided that one of the terms of @xmath73 dominates the rest @xmath75 in particular , we have @xmath76 for all @xmath6 .",
    "recall that the space of fourier transforms of finite borel measures on @xmath77 , equipped with the @xmath70 norms of these fourier transforms , is a banach algebra under pointwise multiplication .",
    "therefore @xmath73 is invertible , too .",
    "( the inverse of @xmath73 can be written in terms of a neumann series of exponents . ) but this means that @xmath78 is a multiplier of the space @xmath79 .",
    "hence , there exists a function @xmath67 , which solves the equation and @xmath80 ( for some absolute constant @xmath34 ) . using",
    "we can further restore the coefficient - function @xmath53 .",
    "it would solve the integral equation and would satisfy the same bound as the function @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 this fact , along with the conditions on kernel @xmath3 is sufficient to make the integral in equation convergent , and to justify the passage from back to .",
    "[ r.necessary ] the conditions and are somewhat necessary . indeed , if some functions @xmath83\\rightarrow \\mathbb r$ ] are constant on all dyadic intervals with sufficiently small length and if the coefficient function @xmath53 is in @xmath79 then the lemma still holds .",
    "thus , whatever kernel @xmath3 is restored by the averaging of corresponding haar shift operator , it must satisfy and .",
    "if additionally @xmath14 is odd and @xmath17 is even with respect to the point @xmath84 , then @xmath19 would be a piecewise linear function with bounded support , vanishing at @xmath61 .",
    "so , and would imply that @xmath3 has to satisfy and ."
