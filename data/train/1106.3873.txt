    "the recent neutrino oscillation data have greatly enriched our knowledge of the flavor structure of leptons . after the discovery of neutrino oscillations , there has been a considerable progress in determining the values of the neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing angles relating the mass eigenstates to the flavor eigenstates .",
    "the remaining challenges are to determine the absolute mass scale of neutrinos , the mass hierarchy in the neutrino sector ( sign of @xmath2 ) and the value of 1 - 3 mixing angle ( in particular if it is zero or not ) amongst others .",
    "one has to understand the systematics of the experimental data to unravel symmetries of the lepton mass matrices .",
    "a successful phenomenological anstz for the neutrino mixing matrix consistent with the present neutrino data was proposed by harrison , perkins and scott @xcite known as tribimaximal mixing ( tbm ) and is given by @xmath3 recently , non - abelian flavor symmetries @xcite have been invoked intensively to account for tbm .",
    "these non - abelian flavor symmetries can explain various , apparently unrelated , phenomena in flavor physics thus providing hints for the new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the basic features of the neutrino masses and mixings can be traced back to a minimum realization of the smallest discrete non - abelian group @xmath0 which is the permutation group of three objects . a large number of papers @xcite have presented detailed models based on @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the permutation matrices in the three dimensional reducible representation are @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where the matrices in each equation belong to the same class of @xmath0",
    ". the tbm mixing matrix @xmath7 is one of the transformations which relates the given basis to the irreducible one thus implying a close connection between tbm and @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 is invariant under @xmath0 which requires @xmath9=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is any of the six permutation matrices given in eqns .",
    "( 2 , 3 , 4 ) . in the present work",
    ", we consider the possibility in which the neutrino mass matrix is dominated by a term with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we then consider possible perturbations that violate this symmetry so that the perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath11 still satisfies the @xmath0 invariant constraint @xcite @xmath12 such connections have been considered in the literature from phenomenological point of view . in this analysis",
    ", we take the charged lepton mass matrix to be diagonal .",
    "this simple choice of basis can be made as the physical mixing matrix does not depend on the choice of basis .",
    "the property of basis independence allows one to rotate the charged lepton mass matrix to the flavor basis where it is diagonal .",
    "if a horizontal symmetry exists it must be simultaneously a symmetry of the charged leptons as well as the neutrinos before the gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "after symmetry breaking when the fermions acquire mass , the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices should be constrained by different representations of the symmetry group in order to have non - zero mixing .",
    "the full group before symmetry breaking is at least a product group of the symmetry groups of the charged leptons and the neutrinos .",
    "here we consider @xmath0 to be the residual group in the neutrino sector .",
    "for the charged lepton sector , @xmath13 symmetry can be taken as the residual symmetry which yields non degenerate diagonal charged lepton mass matrix @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix implied by the commutator in eqn . ( 5 ) is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in general complex and @xmath18 is called the democratic matrix",
    ". the neutrino mass matrix can be diagonalized by the tbm matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 respectively . here",
    ", the two degenerate eigenvalues correspond to the mass eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 contrary to the experimental data where @xmath21 and @xmath23 have smaller mass difference .",
    "this problem was overcome by jora _",
    "_ @xcite by introducing a majorana - type @xmath24 violating phase @xmath25 between the complex vectors @xmath16 and @xmath20 which does not affect the usual neutrino oscillations but affects the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the phase @xmath25 can be adjusted to ensure equal magnitude ( but different directions ) of @xmath16 and @xmath20 , thereby , leading to degenerate mass spectrum for @xmath0 invariant @xmath8 at the zeroth order . in the present work",
    ", the complex plane is oriented in a manner so that the parameter @xmath17 is completely imaginary .",
    "the complex vector @xmath16 lies in the fourth quadrant and is given by @xmath26    and the allowed range of @xmath25 is @xmath27 .",
    "the complex parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be written in terms of the real free parameter @xmath28 as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     @xmath24 violating phase @xmath30 , the parameter @xmath28 becomes zero and this value of @xmath25 is , hence , not allowed .",
    "democratic charged lepton mass matrices of the form @xmath31 and diagonal neutrino mass matrices of the form @xmath32 have been discussed earlier @xcite in the context of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the possibility @xmath33 has , also been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 flavor symmetry in the context of type ( i+ii ) see saw has been discussed in ref .",
    "a generic feature of this approach is a democratic charged lepton mass matrix and a diagonal neutrino mass matrix at the zeroth order .",
    "in contrast , we consider the most general @xmath0 invariant neutrino mass matrices at the zeroth order in the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "in this section , we study the effects of perturbations from @xmath0 invariant neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 , by the elements of @xmath0 group itself .",
    "we follow a simple and highly predictive approach to obtain the results of perturbations order by order such that the neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 is invariant under @xmath0 at the zeroth order .",
    "parametrizing higher order perturbations of decreasing importance in terms of a small real dimensionless perturbation parameter @xmath34 , the perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath35 is given by @xmath36+\\lambda^2 [ s^q]+\\lambda^3 [ s^r]),\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is invariant under @xmath0 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be any of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the real parameter with dimensions of mass and magnitude of the order of one in the units of the absolute mass scale .",
    "the perturbation matrices are given in eqn .",
    "( 4 ) and belong to the same class of @xmath0 .",
    "each perturbation matrix given above is invariant under a different @xmath1 subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of this approach of perturbation is that there are only four free parameters .",
    "another appealing aspect of this approach is that the @xmath0 symmetry is broken by its elements in the same representation .",
    "we see that even after breaking @xmath0 by above matrices , the @xmath0 invariant constraint ( eqn .",
    "6 ) remains intact which leads to a trimaximal eigenvector for the perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath45 .",
    "we follow the line of argument given in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] to decide as to which of the three perturbation matrices @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the favoured one to be the first order perturbation . since zeroth order neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 has two degenerate eigenvalues , we use quantum mechanical degenerate perturbation theory . due to the double degeneracy between the eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the tribimaximal mixing matrix @xmath7 given in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) is not the unique one to diagonalize @xmath8 .",
    "rather it is a more general matrix @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rotation matrix in the 1 - 3 plane given by @xmath48 in the ordinary quantum mechanical perturbation theory , the first order correction to the @xmath49 eigenvector is given by @xmath50 .",
    "however , in case of degenerate perturbation theory , when @xmath51 , the numerator has to vanish which implies the following condition for the ( 1,3 ) matrix element : @xmath52 amongst the three perturbation matrices only @xmath42 satisfies the above condition thus leading to @xmath7 for @xmath53 .",
    "the solution @xmath54 , on the other hand , just changes the sign of first and third column of tribimaximal mixing matrix @xmath7 .",
    "however , the other two solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not lead to the desired tbm form .",
    "the other two matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 also do not lead to the desired form of tbm mixing matrix , thus , making @xmath42 as the favoured perturbation at the first order .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix after the first order perturbation with @xmath42 becomes @xmath57 the eigenvalues of this mass matrix are    @xmath58    here , we see that @xmath59 and @xmath60 when @xmath34 is positive i.e. after the first order perturbation @xmath61 and @xmath62 remain degenerate , while @xmath60 thus implying that our perturbation is in the right direction as experimentally the mass - squared difference @xmath63 is much smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix after this first order perturbation is still @xmath7 .",
    "the next step is to add the higher order perturbations to remove the degeneracy in the magnitudes of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and also to deviate from tbm .",
    "this can be done by taking @xmath65 as the second order and @xmath66 as the third order perturbation or @xmath67 as the second order and @xmath68 as the third order perturbation .",
    "we investigated both these possibilities in our analysis and found that the choice of the second and the third order perturbation matrices only affects the predictions for the 2 - 3 mixing angle which we discuss later .",
    "taking @xmath65 as the second order perturbation and @xmath66 as the third order perturbation , the perturbation matrix becomes @xmath69 hence , the perturbed neutrino mass matrix becomes @xmath70 it is interesting to note that the perturbation matrix in eqn .",
    "( 16 ) is retrocirculant having a trimaximal eigenvector @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "also the perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath45 is a magic mass matrix @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the perturbed neutrino mass matrix @xmath45 upto the third order perturbation are given by @xmath72 the magnitudes of the eigenvalues which are the neutrino masses are given by @xmath73 these neutrino masses are made real positive by the phase matrix @xmath74 where @xmath75    it can be seen from eqn .",
    "( 19 ) that the neutrino masses depend on the majorana - type @xmath24 violating phase @xmath25 .",
    "however , the lepton number conserving neutrino oscillations do not depend on this phase .",
    "therefore , we find the mass - squared differences are independent of the majorana phase .",
    "@xmath76 notice that the leading order term in the solar mass - squared difference @xmath77 is of the order of @xmath78 which makes it naturally small to be consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix after the third order perturbation is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 an interesting feature of this type of breaking of @xmath0 is that the neutrino mixing matrix is completely determined from the retrocirculant perturbation matrix and is , thus , independent of the parameters appearing in the zeroth order neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 . as a consequence ,",
    "the deviations from tbm are entirely determined in terms of single unknown perturbation parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the neutrino mixing angles upto the third order perturbation are given by @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 the solar and reactor neutrino mixing angles are related by @xmath84 as pointed out earlier in this section , the second and third order perturbation matrices can be interchanged . as a consequence of this interchange ,",
    "the predictions for all the parameters remain intact except for the 2 - 3 mixing angle @xmath85 which is given by @xmath86 it can be seen that the 2 - 3 mixing angle in this case is shifted to below maximal by the same amount as it was above maximal in the earlier case .",
    "the above results are obtained when the perturbation parameter @xmath34 is positive .",
    "since @xmath87 is real it can also be negative .",
    "when @xmath34 is positive , we get the inverted hierarchical mass spectrum for neutrinos and a negative @xmath34 gives a normal hierarchical mass spectrum .",
    "we use the constraints for the mass squared differences from the known oscillation data @xcite viz .",
    "@xmath88 for normal hierarchy _",
    "i.e. _ for negative @xmath34 , the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath34 are constrained to lie in the range @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) respectively at the @xmath91 c.l . in this model whereas the free parameter @xmath28 and the majorana phase @xmath25 are constrained to the range @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively at the same confidence level .",
    "the model , also , leads to small deviations of the mixing angles from tbm , given by @xmath94 while the allowed ranges for these mixing angles @xcite are given by @xmath95 + for inverted hierarchy _",
    "i.e. _ positive @xmath34 the allowed ranges for the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath34 are @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) respectively at the @xmath91 c.l . whereas the free parameter @xmath28 and the majorana phase @xmath25 are constrained to the range @xmath98 and @xmath93 respectively at the same confidence level .",
    "the deviations of the mixing angles are given by @xmath99    it can be seen from the neutrino mixing matrix given in eqn . (",
    "23 ) that there is no dirac - type @xmath24 violation in this model as @xmath34 is taken to be real .",
    "the @xmath24 violation in this model is only due to the phase @xmath25 which gives majorana - type @xmath24 violation .",
    "however , @xmath34 may , in general , be complex and there will be another @xmath24 violating phase in the mixing matrix for complex @xmath34 leading to dirac - type @xmath24 violation .",
    "the possible measurement of the effective majorana mass @xmath100 in the neutrinoless double beta decay searches will provide information on the majorana - type @xmath24 violating phase .",
    "the analysis of @xmath100 is significant because a stringent constraint on the value of effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath100 was obtained in the @xmath101 heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite @xmath102ev .",
    "there are a large number of forthcoming projects such as supernemo @xcite , cuore @xcite , couricino @xcite and gerda @xcite which aim to achieve a sensitivity below 0.01ev .",
    "the effective majorana mass which determines the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay is given by    @xmath103    the value of @xmath100 for normal and inverted hierarchies are @xmath104 and @xmath105 . the correlation plots between the effective majorana mass and the perturbation parameter @xmath34 is given in fig .",
    "2(b ) and 3(b ) .",
    "we studied the breaking of @xmath0 invariant neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis by perturbing it to the third order of a small perturbation parameter to examine its consequences for neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix at the zeroth order gives two degenerate eigenvalues @xmath21 and @xmath22 thus leading to results contrary to the experimental data .",
    "this problem is fixed by the introduction of the majorana phase which renders the magnitude of all the three eigenvalues equal at the zeroth order .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by the introduction of perturbation matrices chosen to be @xmath0 group matrices invariant under three different @xmath1 subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "the higher order perturbations are suppressed by increasing powers of the small perturbation parameter .",
    "the quantum mechanical degenerate perturbation theory uniquely chooses the first order perturbation matrix while the second and the third order perturbations are simultaneously added .",
    "the mass - squared differences are found in terms of the perturbation parameter @xmath34 , the free parameter @xmath28 and parameter @xmath44 which is of the order one .",
    "interestingly , the mixing matrix and the mixing angles in the model are independent of the parameters of the @xmath0 invariant neutrino mass matrix and are determined only in terms of perturbation parameter @xmath34 .",
    "this scheme of @xmath0 breaking results in very small deviations from the tbm when confronted with experimental inputs of the mass - squared differences .",
    "both normal and inverted hierarchical mass spectra are allowed in this model .",
    "the cause of @xmath24 violation in this scenario is the majorana - type @xmath24 violating phase .",
    "the allowed range of the effective majorana mass obtained in the present study lies well within the reach of the forthcoming experiments providing a stringent test of this model .",
