    "the expansion of qcd in inverse powers of the mass has become an indispensable tool for the analysis of heavy hadron decays .",
    "this method , formulated as an effective field theory known as heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , has put the physics of heavy quarks on a qcd based and thus model independent framework .    while applications of these methods to systems with a single heavy quark has been studied extensively ( see @xcite for reviews ) ,",
    "there is a lot of motivation to extend this ideas to systems with two or more heavy quarks , because heavy quarkonia ( the @xmath3 s and the @xmath4 s ) have been known since some time and the observation of flavored `` doubly heavy '' systems ( such as the @xmath5 family of states ) is very likely in the near future .",
    "the starting point of the construction of an effective theory for these systems is again the expansion of the relevant greens functions in @xmath1 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "however , it turns out @xcite that one can not use the static limit for two heavy quarks , in particular if their velocities differ only by an amount of order @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath7 as it is the case in a particle containing two heavy quarks .",
    "the static limit breaks down and one is forced to include at least the kinetic energy into the leading order dynamics .",
    "however , unlike the case of one heavy quark an effective theory for heavy quarkonia in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom is more complicated .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that in a heavy quarkonium not only the scale of the light degrees of freedom ( as e.g. @xmath8 in hqet ) appears as a scale small compared to the heavy quark mass , but also scales which do depend on the heavy quark mass .",
    "this point becomes clear if one studies a system like the positronium first .",
    "in the qed case one may safely assume that the coupling @xmath9 does not run when one studies a qed bound state consisting of two heavy fermions , which we shall assume to be of the same mass @xmath6 .",
    "the coupling @xmath9 is a small parameter and hence the inverse bohr radius @xmath10 of such a system is small compared to the heavy mass @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of qed it makes sense to talk about the binding energy @xmath11 of this system , which is again smaller by a factor @xmath9 , @xmath12 .",
    "thus in a coulombic system there are two scales , the inverse bohr radius and the binding energy which are both small compared to the heavy mass : @xmath13 in addition , both scales depend on the heavy mass , in this simple example in a trivial way .",
    "the expansion parameter in this case is the relative velocity @xmath14 between the two heavy constituents , and a consistent scheme for the velocity counting has been set up .",
    "the velocity in a coulombic system turns out to be @xmath15 and hence is indeed a small parameter to expand in .",
    "in particular , the binding energy is of the order @xmath16 .",
    "switching now to full qcd the coupling starts to run , introducing another scale @xmath17 .",
    "the problem in applying the coulombic hierarchy of scales to realistic quarkonia is related to the question at which point in the hierarchy ( [ coul ] ) @xmath17 enters .",
    "this is obviously a question how large @xmath6 is , and for `` superheavy '' quarkonia one can have the scenario @xmath18 such that the binding is coulombic and  from the point of view of qcd  is of perturbative nature , since @xmath19 .",
    "this case is governed by non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) as formulated by bodwin , braaten and lepage @xcite , where the velocity counting of the qed analogue is used .",
    "in fact , this type of counting is also correct as long as the binding is due to instantaneous gluons such that the emission of a dynamical , transverse gluon is suppressed by some power of the velocity .",
    "realistic quarkonia , such as charmonium of bottomonium , do not seem to fulfill the requirement of being coulombic .",
    "this becomes obvious from the spectra as well as from the leptonic widths , which are related to the wave functions at the origin in the simplest picture .",
    "here it seems that @xmath17 is at least larger than the binding energy or maybe even larger than the inverse bohr radius . in such a case",
    "it is not obvious what the parameter is in which an expansion should be formulated . the @xmath1 expansion yields in the numerators combinations of covariant derivatives , some of which may be identified with the relative velocity . in a `` minimalistic '' approach ( called in @xcite ) , all derivatives are kept at the price of a proliferation of unknown matrix elements . in other words , in simply the powers of the operators are counted and one can translate nrqcd into and vice versa , finding that some matrix elements in at leading order are down by factors of @xmath14 in the counting scheme of nrqcd .    in the present paper we shall study a simple process which could shed some light on the question of how to correctly count the `` powers '' of a matrix element in the @xmath1 expansion for realistic heavy quarkonia .",
    "we shall discuss the decay @xmath20 + _ light hadrons _ , in which the hard subprocess is the annihilation of two heavy quarks into a photon and a gluon , which implies that the two heavy quarks have to be in a color octet state at the matching scale @xmath6 .",
    "the matching to the effective theory thus yields ( at the matching scale @xmath21 ) four - quark operators in which the quark - antiquark pair is in a color octet state , and hence in naive factorization these would vanish .",
    "also in nrqcd these matrix elements would require at least an additional dynamical gluon , the emission of which is suppressed by factors of @xmath14 ; hence this process is an interesting laboratory to test the size of these octet contributions which seem to play some role in quarkonia production .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief review of the effective theory approach used here . in section 3",
    "we set up the necessary machinery for these decays in which the two heavy quarks annihilate and review the short distance contributions . in section 4",
    "we discuss the hadronic matrix elements and the restrictions imposed by heavy quarkonia spin symmetry . in section 5",
    "we apply this method to calculate the total rate and the photon spectrum in @xmath20 + light hadrons .",
    "finally we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "as we shall exploit the fact that the mass of the heavy quark is large compared to both @xmath17 and all other scales such as the analoga of the inverse bohr radius and the binding energy , we are starting from a @xmath1 expansion of the qcd lagrangian and the corresponding expansion of the fields up to order @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that there are different ways to perform such an expansion ( as e.g. by integrating out the small component fields from the qcd functional @xcite or by a foldy  wouthuysen transformation @xcite ) ; although the @xmath1 expansions of their lagrangians and of their fields look different , the result for the greens functions will be the same . hence one may pick the most convenient representation for the application under discussion and we pick @xcite +   + where @xmath23 is the velocity of the quarkonia , and the transverse components of the derivative is given by @xmath24 .",

    "the first terms of these two expansions ( [ fwfield ] ) define the static limit , which has been successfully applied to systems with a single heavy quark . in order to describe a system with more than one heavy ( anti)quark one has to write down the same expansion ( [ fwfield ] ) for each heavy quark .",
    "however , there is no static limit for a system with two heavy quarks if the two heavy quarks move with almost the same velocity as it is the case for a quarkonium ; one runs into problems with diverging phases and `` complex anomalous dimensions '' , which are considered in detail in @xcite .    in order to cure this problem",
    "one has to choose the unperturbed system such that these phases are already generated by the leading order dynamics , i.e.  instead of the static limit one has to use the non - relativistic lagrangian . in this case",
    "the `` power counting '' has to be modified in such a way that the leading term is the static plus the kinetic energy term , leading to the fact that the `` time derivative '' @xmath30 has to be counted as two powers of the `` spatial derivative '' @xmath31 . in physical terms , for a bound state this corresponds to the balance between potential and kinetic energy , since the covariant time derivative @xmath30 contains also the potential",
    ".    for a system with a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark one then starts from @xmath32 where we have assumed for simplicity that the two quarks have the same mass ; the case of unequal mass is obvious .",
    "naive power counting would suggest to include also the pauli term @xmath33 into the leading - order lagrangian .",
    "however , in a coulombic system this term is in fact down by powers of @xmath14 , since the chromomagnetic field is generated by the relative motion of the two heavy quarks ; this has been made manifest in @xcite .",
    "most of the success of hqet is due to heavy quark flavor and spin symmetry .",
    "however , once one uses ( [ lnull ] ) the symmetries are somewhat different for or nrqcd .",
    "first of all , ( [ lnull ] ) depends on the mass through the kinetic energy term ; consequently the states will depend on @xmath6 in a non - perturbative way and heavy flavor symmetry is lost . in this way the mass dependent small scales ( the inverse bohr radius and the binding energy ) are generated by taking matrix elements of operators involving derivatives with these states . on the other hand , since the chromomagnetic moment operator does not appear to leading order , ( [ lnull ] ) does not depend on the spins of the two heavy quarks , and hence there is a spin symmetry which is larger than in hqet because we have two heavy quark spins ; the resulting symmetry is an @xmath34 corresponding to separate rotations of the two spins .    for the case of heavy quarkonia all states fall into spin symmetry quartets which should be degenerate in the non - relativistic limit . in spectroscopic notation @xmath35 these quartets consist of the states @xmath36 .",
    "\\label{fourstates}\\ ] ] for the ground states the spin symmetry quartet consists of the @xmath0 ( the @xmath37 state ) and the three polarization directions of the @xmath38 ( the @xmath39 state ) .",
    "the heavy quarkonia spin symmetry restricts the non - perturbative input to a calculation of processes involving heavy quarkonia .",
    "of particular interest are decays in which the heavy quarks inside the heavy quarkonium annihilate .",
    "the annihilation is a short distance process that can be calculated perturbatively in terms of quarks and gluons , while the long distance contribution is encoded in certain matrix elements of quark operators .",
    "logarithmic dependences on the heavy quark mass may be calculated by employing the usual renormalization group machinery .",
    "the starting point to calculate processes like @xmath40 _ light hadrons _ , @xmath41 _ light hadrons _ , or the corresponding decays of the @xmath38 states is the transition operator @xmath42 for two heavy quarks which annihilate into light degrees of freedom .",
    "this will in general be bilinear in the heavy quark fields , such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 involves only light degrees of freedom and @xmath45 and @xmath46 correspond to the cms and relative coordinate respectively .",
    "if we identify the field @xmath47 with the quark and @xmath48 with the antiquark , so we shall make the large scale @xmath6 explicit by redefining the fields as @xmath49 this corresponds to the usual splitting of the heavy quark momentum into a large part @xmath50 and a residual piece @xmath51 . inserting this into ( [ top ] ) one finds @xmath52        \\bar{q}_v^{(- ) } ( x+\\xi ) k ( x,\\xi )   q_v^{(+ ) } ( x-\\xi ) \\,.\\ ] ] the inclusive rate for the decay of a quarkonium @xmath53 _ light degrees of freedom _ is then given by @xmath54 | \\psi \\rangle \\,.\\ ] ] the next step is to perform an operator product expansion for the non - local product of the quark field operators . this expansion will yield four - quark operators of increasing dimension starting with dim-6 operators . the increasing dimension of these operators will be compensated by inverse powers of the heavy quark mass , so generically the rate takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the dimension of the operator and @xmath57 labels different operators with the same dimension .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 are related to the short distance annihilation process and hence may be calculated in perturbation theory in terms of quarks and gluons .",

    "the non - perturbative contributions are encoded in the matrix elements of the local four - quark operators , and the mass dependence of these operators is also expanded in powers of @xmath1 and thus the remaining @xmath6 dependence of the matrix elements is only due to the states . in terms of the @xmath6 independent static fields @xmath61 one has in total four dim-6 operators @xmath62 \\ ,                [ \\bar{h}_v^{(- ) } \\gamma_5 c h_v^{(+ ) } ] \\mbox { and } a_2 ^{(c ) } = [ \\bar{h}_v^{(+ ) } \\gamma^\\perp_\\mu c h_v^{(- ) } ] \\ ,               [ \\bar{h}_v^{(- ) } \\gamma_\\perp^\\mu c h_v^{(+ ) } ] \\ ] ] with the color matrix @xmath63 , where one has the two possibilities @xmath64 ( color singlet ) or @xmath65 ( color octet ) .",

    "the expression obtained for the photon spectrum contains @xmath110-function and its derivatives which is obviously unphysical .",
    "the origin of this singular behavior is of kinematical nature : at the partonic level , the initial state quarks move with the same velocity and hence act like a single particle , which then decays into two massless objects .",
    "thus this is a two particle decay and so the energies of the final state particles are fixed .    in order to compare with the observed hadron spectrum one has to apply some `` smearing '' in the sense of @xcite ; in particular , if one calculates moments of the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) one obtains a sensible answer which may be compared to the observed spectrum or @xmath117 decays @xcite , where the @xmath1 expansion also only yields the moments of the observed spectrum . ] . in other words",

    "all these operators are down by at least two powers of @xmath14 and hence this process would be very much suppressed compared to allowed processes such as @xmath123 + _ light hadrons_. hence this process is a nice testing ground for factorization and the power counting scheme of nrqcd .",
    "unlike systems with a single heavy quark quarkonia - like systems are much more difficult to describe .",
    "the simplicity of hqet is due to the fact that only a single small scale appears , which is independent of the heavy mass , and thus a static limit may be performed . in a quarkonium",
    "several small scales appear which depend in a non - perturbative way on the heavy mass .",
    "the superheavy case resembles very much a qed like system which is bound by coulombic forces .",
    "in such a system one has the inverse bohr radius @xmath124 and the binding energy @xmath125 as small scales , and if @xmath126 the binding is in the sense perturbative that it is due to one gluon exchange which takes in coulomb gauge the form of an instantaneous potential .    in this superheavy case",
    "one may transfer practically all the knowledge of the description of positronium in nrqed to the qcd case .",
    "however , realistic quarkonia do not seem to be too close to this limit , since the charm and the bottom mass are too small to fulfill @xmath127 .",
    "thus the power counting scheme of nrqed can not be naively transferred to qcd , and the way how to organize the effective theory calculation becomes obscure .",
    "the safe way in this case is to rely only on the dimension of the operators involved , thereby taking into account a proliferation of unknown parameters , which all would need to be determined from experiment .",
    "it is then of some interest to define observables which are sensitive to specific matrix elements and hence may shed some light on what happens in realistic quarkonia .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied the decay @xmath20 + _ light hadrons _ , which would be strongly suppressed compared to @xmath128 + _ light hadrons _",
    ", if both @xmath129 and @xmath0 were superheavy . however , this process is not suppressed due to higher powers of @xmath1 appearing in the heavy mass expansion , rather it is suppressed due to the quarkonia states , with which the matrix elements are taken .",
    "it turns out that the moments of the measured photon spectrum in @xmath20 + _ light hadrons _ is sensitive to matrix elements which would be strongly suppressed for the superheavy case .",
    "unfortunately , there are not yet data on this process , such that a check , whether it is really suppressed as predicted by the counting of powers of @xmath14 has to wait for future experiments .",
