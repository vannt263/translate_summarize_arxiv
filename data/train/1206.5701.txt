    "understanding the nature of tev scale physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been a major focus of research in particle physics for many years .",
    "it has acquired a new sense of urgency in view of the discovery potential of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .",
    "ongoing non - accelerator and low energy experiments searching for dark matter , neutrinoless double beta decay , rare muon decays , and the supersymmetric modes of proton decay are also sensitive to tev scale physics , although only indirectly . on the theoretical front the idea of grand unification , which provides a framework for unifying the various forces of nature and the different types of matter ( quarks and leptons ) , remains to be one of the leading candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) based on @xmath0 gauge symmetry provide arguably the most natural framework for small neutrino masses .",
    "a class of minimal @xmath0 models which employs a * 126 * -plet higgs field @xcite to break the baryon number minus lepton number @xmath4 gauge symmetry has been found to be quite successful @xcite in explaining the observed neutrino mixing pattern , including the recent measurements of @xmath7 @xcite .    despite their elegance and success in explaining the pattern of neutrino mixing and fermion masses in general , the only sure way to test guts appears to be the discovery of proton decay into specific final states .",
    "the most widely studied decay modes are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with the neutrino mode arising prominently in supersymmetric guts .",
    "these modes have the feature that they preserve @xmath4 symmetry @xcite .",
    "while this is a generic feature of most minimal single step gut models , it was recently pointed out@xcite that since @xmath0 models break @xmath4 gauge symmetry ( necessary for generating majorana neutrino masses ) , they admit scenarios where @xmath4violating nucleon decay modes @xcite such as @xmath10 arise at an observable level . these modes , which obey the selection rule @xmath11 , become significant if we choose alternative coupling unification routes .",
    "we continue to explore this theme in the present paper , focusing on @xmath11 processes more generally .",
    "we first point out that in the presence of a color sextet scalar field transforming as @xmath12 under @xmath13 ( denoted as @xmath14 ) , along with a complex weak triplet @xmath15 at the tev scale , the three gauge couplings of the standard model unify at a scale @xmath16 gev .",
    "if the @xmath14 field is replaced by the color sextet scalar @xmath17 transforming as @xmath18 , the success in the unification of couplings is not altered by much .",
    "these color sextet scalars arise naturally in @xmath0 as the partners of the higgs field employed for the seesaw mechanism .",
    "specifically , @xmath14 and @xmath17 are contained in the @xmath19plet of higgs in @xmath0 .",
    "our results provide added motivation for the search for these color sextet scalars at the lhc",
    ".    the presence of either @xmath14 or @xmath17 color sextet field at the tev scale will induce neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillation , which is a @xmath11 process .",
    "it turns out that this process can probe @xmath4 violation occurring at energies all the way up to the unification scale of order @xmath20 gev , given that one of the color sextet scalars has a tev scale mass .",
    "we estimate the transition time for free neutron oscillation to be @xmath21 sec . , which is in the observable range of proposed experiments with currently available reactor neutron fluxes .    in ref",
    "@xcite we proposed a new way of generating baryon asymmetry of the universe at the gut scale in @xmath0 , in the @xmath4 violating decays of gut scale scalars .",
    "such an asymmetry will survive down to low temperatures , unaffected by the electroweak sphaleron processes , owing to the violation of @xmath4 in these decays . here",
    "we show that this baryogenesis mechanism is realized naturally in the present context with a tev scale color sextet .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 has a tev scale mass , while @xmath17 has a gut scale mass .",
    "the decay @xmath22 is then allowed in @xmath0 , with the relevant vertex arising for example from the @xmath23 quartic coupling , after insertion of a @xmath4 breaking vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath17 have @xmath24 , so this decay violates @xmath4 by two units .",
    "we show that there is sufficient cp violation in this decay in minimal @xmath0 models , so that adequate baryon asymmetry is induced .",
    "thus in this class of models there is a direct connection between baryon asymmetry of the universe and neutron  antineutron oscillations .    in sec .",
    "5 we make some general remarks , not specific to @xmath0 models , on light scalars accessible to the lhc and baryon number violation .",
    "we identify scalars that have yukawa couplings to the fermions which can survive down to the tev scale without causing problems with rapid nucleon decay . allowing for planck scale suppressed operators , we find that only color singlets , sextets , and octets are safe from rapid nucleon decay problem .",
    "color triplet scalars such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 would have dimension five planck scale suppressed couplings to fermions that violate baryon number @xcite .",
    "such particles are disfavored at the tev scale , unless there is a new symmetry such as @xmath4 that is broken at or below a scale @xmath27 gev , so that the planck suppressed operators have an additional @xmath28 suppression factor .",
    "we argue that models with tev scale color sextets developed here for successful unification are fully consistent with these general nucleon decay constraints .",
    "in this section we demonstrate in a bottom  up approach how the presence of a color sextet scalar field along with a complex @xmath29 triplet scalar at the tev scale fixes the problem of unification mismatch of the three gauge couplings that occurs in the standard model .",
    "we then show that these fields arise naturally in minimal @xmath0 unified theories .",
    "our unification analysis uses one  loop renormalization group equations ( rge ) , and ignores high scale threshold effects . oscillation . ] in several variants we find consistent gauge coupling unification without the need for an intermediate scale . in non ",
    "susy @xmath0 models the traditional route is to assume an intermediate symmetry such as @xmath30 realized above a scale of order @xmath31 gev .",
    "gauge coupling unification in this traditional route has been studied in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we divert from that route and assume that the gauge symmetry is simply @xmath13 all the way to the unification scale .",
    "thus , in our framework , @xmath0 breaks directly down to the sm , but in the process leaves a color sextet and weak triplet scalars light to the tev scale .",
    "consider now a scenario where a color sextet scalar field @xmath14 with the quantum numbers @xmath12 and a complex weak triplet scalar @xmath32 survive down to the tev scale .",
    "writing the gauge beta functions as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 stands for 1,2,3 depending on whether the gauge group is @xmath35 , @xmath29 or @xmath36 ) so that the evolution equations for the gauge couplings are given by : @xmath37 , we find for the scenario mentioned above @xmath38 .",

    "we note that even with a single higgs doublet in the low energy theory , very good unification is found to occur .     with a color sextet scalar @xmath42 , a complex weak triplet scalar @xmath32 and a second higgs doublet @xmath39 included at 1 tev .",
    "results are obtained with one  loop rge . ]",
    "we have also studied the case where a @xmath43 color sextet scalar with the quantum number @xmath18 survives to the tev sale , along with a complex @xmath32 scalar and a second higgs doublet @xmath39 .",
    "this scenario would correspond to the beta function coefficients being @xmath44 , which differs only very slightly from the @xmath45 functions that go into fig .",
    "excellent results are obtained for coupling unification in this case as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that a unification triangle would begin to develop as the masses of the tev scale scalars are increased beyond @xmath46 tev . while the area of this triangle is much smaller than the corresponding one that arises purely within the sm , and unification acceptable once high scale threshold effects are included , it is nevertheless encouraging that the preferred mass of the color sextet is around 1 tev , which is then accessible to direct detection at the lhc @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ unif ] we infer the unification scale to be near @xmath47 gev , and the unified gauge coupling to be @xmath48 .",
    "the lifetime for gauge boson mediated proton decay @xmath49 is close to the present experimental limit of @xmath50 yrs .",
    "@xcite in this model as we show below .",
    "the rate for proton decay into this mode is given by @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chiral lagrangian factors , @xmath54 is the hadronic matrix element , @xmath55 is the renormalization factor of the effective dimension six operator , and @xmath56 is the mass of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 gauge bosons of @xmath0 .",

    "how do these light scalars fit into the framework of non ",
    "susy @xmath0 ?",
    "we note that minimal models assume a @xmath19plet of higgs for breaking @xmath4 symmetry and for generating neutrino masses .",
    "the @xmath19 decomposes under @xmath66 subgroup of @xmath0 as @xmath67 it is the @xmath68 fragment of the @xmath69 that generates a large majorana mass for the right  handed neutrino , after acquiring a gut scale vev along its sm singlet component , thus breaking @xmath4 by two units .",
    "the same @xmath68 fragment contains the color sextet fields @xmath42 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with the quantum numbers referring to @xmath13 .",
    "thus the @xmath14 color sextet , or the @xmath17 color sextet that we assumed to survive down to the tev scale arises naturally in the process of implementing the seesaw mechanism in @xmath0 . in order to complete the symmetry breaking an additional @xmath72 and/or @xmath73 higgs field is needed .",
    "these fields decompose under @xmath66 as @xmath74 the @xmath75 fragment of @xmath72 and the @xmath76 fragment of @xmath73 contain the @xmath32 field that we assumed to survive to the tev scale .",
    "we realize that making these fields light would entail additional fine  tunings .",
    "neutron - antineutron oscillation arises in theories beyond the sm from @xmath77 dimension nine effective operators @xcite .",
    "there are several such operators , we focus on the operator @xmath78 , which is the one induced by the color sextet fields used to fix the unification problem of the standard model in the previous section . due to its high dimensionality , this and other such operator scale as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a heavy mass scale corresponding to the scale of baryon number violation .",
    "very roughly we can estimate the @xmath3 oscillation time to be @xmath81 . the present limit on neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillation inferred from constraints on matter disintegration is @xmath82 sec . @xcite .",
    "the direct limit from free neutron oscillation search is @xmath83 sec .",
    "@xcite , which is slightly weaker , but does not have the nuclear uncertainties that affect the limit derived from matter disintegration .",
    "these limits translate to a lower bound on the heavy mass scale @xmath84 gev .",
    "generally , in seesaw extensions of the standard model with local @xmath4 symmetry , we expect that @xmath85@xcite , leading to the general perception that in unified @xmath0 models for neutrino masses , the gut scale breaking of @xmath4 symmetry will yield infinitesimally tiny and hence unobservable strength of @xmath86 oscillation amplitude .",
    "although this naive estimate is off by a factor of 100 when compared to more detailed model calculations including the hadronic matrix element @xcite , the main conclusion does not get altered .",
    "the outcome of the operator analysis changes drastically however , once there are new particles at the tev scale .",
    "for example , in a theory with a color sextet higgs field @xmath14 at the tev or sub  tev scale as in the previous section , one can write down a new @xmath87 effective operator @xmath88 ( where we have defined the @xmath89 of the scalar field @xmath14 to be @xmath90 via its yukawa coupling @xmath91 ) . note that this operator has only dimension five and therefore scales by one power of the heavy scale @xmath80 .",
    "all other new mass scales appearing in the @xmath92 operator that mediates @xmath3 oscillation will be near a tev . to see how @xmath86 oscillation arises in such theories , recall that the @xmath14 field belongs to @xmath19plet higgs of @xmath0 gut .",
    "there are other fields in the @xmath19 with gut scale masses , e.g. , @xmath17 which has the yukawa coupling @xmath93 .",
    "of course , these yukawa couplings by themselves would preserve baryon number .",
    "the higgs potential contains a quartic coupling @xmath94 , which when expanded generates a baryon number violating cubic scalar couplings @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the @xmath89 breaking vacuum expectation value of the sm singlet component in @xmath19 .",
    "a combination of these interactions violates baryon number and generates @xmath3 oscillation .    at the @xmath0 level ,",
    "the relevant interactions for @xmath3 oscillation is given by @xmath97 in the symmetric limit of @xmath0 we have @xmath98 with these matrices being symmetric in family indices ( which are not shown explicitly ) .",
    "now suppose that @xmath14 has a tev scale mass , while @xmath17 and @xmath99 have gut scale masses .",
    "the effective @xmath100violating interactions below the gut scale is then given by @xmath101 note that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) has one power of an inverse mass , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 are both of the same order .",

    "[ nnbar ] is given by @xmath104 here @xmath105 is a renormalization factor that accounts for the running of the yukawa coupling @xmath106 and the effective @xmath107 operator in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) .",
    "since @xmath14 is a color sextet , the rge factor for @xmath106 is expected to be relatively large , we estimate it to be of order 4 in going from the gut scale to the weak scale .",
    "similarly , the rge factor for the effective @xmath107 operator should be of order 6 . thus the net rge factor can be as large as @xmath108 for the @xmath3 effective operator .",
    "( a detailed calculation of the rge factor will be quite useful . ) choosing @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 gev , @xmath112 gev , and @xmath113 gev as an example , we find @xmath114 sec . for the hadronic matrix element that takes six quarks to neutrons , we have used a value @xmath115 gev@xmath116 @xcite .",
    "here the choice of @xmath106 and @xmath117 corresponds to the first family coupling .",
    "if these couplings are @xmath118 instead , we would obtain @xmath119 sec .",
    "we note that the mass of the @xmath17 scalar being somewhat below the unification scale goes well and may even be required in the model in order for generating the right amount of baryon asymmetry , which is discussed in the next section .",
    "we conclude here that @xmath3 oscillation time can be within reach of proposed experiments with existing luminosity of neutron beams . with a tev scale color sextet",

    "to be very natural in the model .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we pointed out that in @xmath0 models , breaking of @xmath89 symmetry to generate neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism allows for a new scenario for baryognesis .",

    "this asymmetry is not erased by the electroweak sphaleron interactions since sphalerons conserve @xmath89 symmetry .",
    "this mechanism can be implemented in the context of color sextet scalars developed in this paper , as we show below .",

    "examination of all possible one loop induced term leads to the conclusion that in this case , the loop induced term does not overwhelm the tree level term , thereby keeping the potential from going to negative infinity for large values of the fields . in the case of guts , this result can also be seen by looking at the contribution of the trilinear term to the running of the masses of the color sextet fields .",
    "note the similarity of this phenomenon to constraints on @xmath202terms in mssm @xcite . from this discussion , we conclude that when the @xmath89 breaking scale is close to gut scale , for the induced @xmath89 breaking color sextet trilinear to be consistent with vacuum stability , only one of the three sextets can remain in the tev scale while the others have to be at the gut scale . as we saw in sec .",
