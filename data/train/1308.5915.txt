    "frobenius ( pf ) theorem @xcite . as a motivating example , let us consider the _ power control problem _ , one of the most fundamental problems in wireless networks .",
    "the input to this problem consists of @xmath0 receiver - transmitter pairs and their physical locations .",
    "all transmitters are set to transmit at the same time with the same frequency , thus causing interference to the other receivers .",
    "therefore , receiving and decoding a message at each receiver depends on the transmitting power of its paired transmitter as well as the power of the rest of the transmitters .",
    "if the _ signal to interference ratio _ at a receiver , namely , the signal strength received by a receiver divided by the interfering strength of other simultaneous transmissions , is above some _ reception threshold _ @xmath1 , then the receiver successfully receives the message , otherwise it does not @xcite .",
    "the power control problem is then to find an optimal power assignment for the transmitters , so as to make the reception threshold @xmath1 as high as possible and ease the decoding process .",
    "as it turns out , this power control problem can be solved elegantly by casting it as an optimization program and using the perron ",
    "frobenius ( pf ) theorem @xcite .",
    "the theorem can be formulated as dealing with the following optimization problem ( where @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 let @xmath4 denote the optimal solution for program ( [ eq : basic ] ) .",
    "the perron ",
    "frobenius ( pf ) theorem characterizes the solution to this optimization problem and shows the following :    ( pf theorem , short version , @xcite ) let @xmath5 be an irreducible nonnegative matrix .",
    "then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath5 , called the _",
    "frobenius ( pf ) root _ of @xmath5 .",
    "there exists a unique ( eigen-)vector @xmath8 , @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 , called the _",
    "perron vector _ of @xmath5 .",
    "( the pair @xmath11 is hereafter referred to as an _ eigenpair _ of @xmath5 . )    returning to our motivating example , let us consider a more complicated variant of the power control problem , where each receiver has several transmitters that can transmit to it ( and only to it ) synchronously .",
    "since these transmitters are located at different places , it may conceivably be better to divide the power ( or work ) among them , to increase the reception threshold at their common receiver .",
    "again , the question concerns finding the best power assignment among all transmitters .    in this paper",
    "we extend program ( [ eq : basic ] ) to _ nonsquare matrices _ and consider the following extended optimization problem , which in particular captures the multiple transmitters scenario .",
    "( here @xmath12 , @xmath13 . )",
    "@xmath14 we interpret the nonsquare matrices @xmath15 as representing some additional freedom given to the system designer . in this",
    "setting , each _ entity _ ( receiver , in the power control example ) has several _ affectors _ ( transmitters , in the example ) , referred to as its _ supporters _ , which can cooperate in serving it and share the workload . in such a general setting",
    ", we would like to find the best way to organize the cooperation between the supporters of each entity .",
    "the original problem was defined for a square matrix , so the appearance of eigenvalues in the characterization of its solution seems natural . in contrast , in the generalized setting the situation seems more complex .",
    "our main result is an extension of the pf theorem  to nonsquare matrices and systems that give rise to an optimization problem in the form of ( [ eq : extended ] ) , with optimal solution @xmath4 .    ( nonsquare pf theorem , short version ) let @xmath16 be an irreducible nonnegative system ( to be made formal later )",
    ". then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the smallest _",
    " frobenius ( pf ) root _ of all @xmath17 square sub - systems ( defined formally later ) .",
    "there exists a vector @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 has @xmath0 entries greater than 0 and @xmath21 zero entries ( referred to as a @xmath22 solution ) .",
    "in other words , the theorem implies that the option of cooperation does not improve the situation , in the sense that in the optimum solution , no cooperation is needed and only one supporter per entity needs to work .",
    "hence , the additional power of having several potential supporters per entity translates into _ choosing _ the best single supporter and not into _ sharing _ the load between the supporters in some way , as one might have expected .",
    "as it turns out , the lion s share of our analysis involves such a characterization of the optimal solution for ( the non - convex ) problem of program ( [ eq : extended ] ) .",
    "the main challenge is to show that at the optimum , there exists a solution in which only one supporter per entity is required to work ; we call such a solution a @xmath22 solution .",
    "namely , the structure that we establish is that the optimal solution for our nonsquare system is in fact the optimal solution of an _ embedded _ square pf system . indeed , to enjoy the benefits of an equivalent square system , one should show that there exists a solution in which only one supporter per entity is required to work .",
    "interestingly , it turned out to be relatively easy to show that there exists an optimal `` almost @xmath22 '' solution , in which each entity _ except at most one _ has a single active supporter and the remaining entity has at most _ two _ active supporters . despite the presumably large  improvement \" of decreasing the number of servers from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , this still leaves us in the frustrating situation of a nonsquare @xmath25 system , where no spectral characterization for optimal solutions exists . in order to allow us to characterize the optimal solution using the eigenpair of the best square matrix embedded within the nonsquare system",
    ", one must overcome this last hurdle , and reach the `` phase transition '' point of @xmath0 servers , in which the system is _",
    "square_. our main efforts went into showing that the remaining entity , too , can select just one supporter while maintaining optimality , ending with a _",
    "@xmath26 irreducible system where the traditional pf theoremcan be applied .",
    "proving the existence of an optimal @xmath22 solution requires techniques from a wide range of areas to come into play and provide a rich understanding of the system on various levels .",
    "in particular , the analysis exploits combinatorial properties of polytopes , graph - theoretic techniques and analytic tools such as spectral properties of nonnegative matrices and root characterization of integer polynomials . in the context of the above example of power control in wireless network with multiple transmitters per receiver",
    ", a @xmath22 solution means that the best reception threshold is achieved when only a single transmitter transmits to each receiver .",
    "other known applications of the pf theorem  can also be extended in a similar manner .",
    "an example for such applications is the _ input - output economic model _",
    "@xcite . in this economic model ,",
    "each industry produces a commodity and buys commodities ( raw materials ) from other industries .",
    "the percentage profit margin of an industry is the ratio of its total income and total expenses ( for buying its raw materials ) .",
    "it is required to find a pricing maximizing the ratio of the total income and total expenses of all industries .",
    "the extended pf variant of the problem concerns the case where an industry can produce multiple commodities instead of just one . in this example",
    ", the same general phenomenon holds : each industry should charge money only for _ one _ of the commodities it produces .",
    "that is , in the optimal pricing , one commodity per industry has nonzero price , therefore the optimum is a @xmath22 solution . for a more detailed discussion of applications ,",
    "[ short : sec : applications ] .",
    "in addition , in sec .",
    "[ sec : limit ] , we provide a characterization of systems in which a @xmath22 solution does not exist .",
    "while in the original setting the pf root  and pf vector  can be computed in polynomial time , this is not clear in the extended case , since the problem is not convex @xcite ( and not even log - convex ) and there are exponentially many choices in the system even if we know that the optimal solution is @xmath22 and each entity has only two supporters to choose from .",
    "our second main contribution is providing a polynomial time algorithm to find @xmath4 and @xmath20 .",
    "the algorithm uses the fact that fixing @xmath1 yields a relaxed problem which is convex ( actually it becomes a linear program ) .",
    "this allows us to employ the well known interior point method @xcite , for testing a specific @xmath1 for feasibility .",
    "hence , the problem reduces to finding the maximum feasible @xmath1 , and the algorithm does so by applying binary search on @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the search results in an approximate solution , in fact yielding a fully polynomial time approximation scheme ( fptas ) for program ( [ eq : extended ] ) .",
    "this , however , leaves open the intriguing question of whether program ( [ eq : extended ] ) is polynomial . obtaining an exact optimal @xmath4 , along with an appropriate vector @xmath20 , is thus another challenging aspect of the problem .",
    "a central notion in the generalized pf theorem is the _ irreducibility _ of the system . while irreducibility is a well - established concept for square systems , it is less obvious how to define irreducibility for a nonsquare matrix or system as in program .",
    "we provide a suitable definition based on the property that every maximal square ( legal ) subsystem is irreducible , and show that our definition is necessary and sufficient for the theorem to hold .",
    "a key tool in our analysis is what we call the _ constraint graph _ of the system , whose vertex set is the set on @xmath0 constraints ( one per entity ) and whose edges represent direct influence between the constraints . for a square system ,",
    "irreducibility is equivalent to the constraint graph being strongly connected , but for nonsquare systems the situation is more delicate . essentially ,",
    "although the matrices are not square , the notion of constraint graph is well defined and provides a valuable _ square _ representation of the nonsquare system ( i.e. , the adjacency matrix of the graph ) . in @xcite",
    ", we also present a polynomial - time algorithm for testing the irreducibility of a given system , which exploits the properties of the constraint graph .",
    "* related work .",
    "* the pf theorem  establishes the following two important  pf properties \" for a nonnegative square matrix @xmath2 : ( 1 ) the _ perron  frobenius property _ : @xmath5 has a maximal nonnegative eigenpair . if in addition the matrix @xmath5 is _ irreducible _ then its maximal eigenvalue is strictly positive , dominant and with a strictly positive eigenvector .",
    "thus nonnegative irreducible matrix @xmath5 is said to enjoy the _ strong perron ",
    "frobenius property _ @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the _ collatz  wielandt property _ ( a.k.a .",
    "min - max characterization ) : the maximal eigenpair is the optimal solution of program ( [ eq : basic ] ) @xcite .    matrices with these properties have played an important role in a wide variety of applications .",
    "the wide applicability of the pf theorem , as well as the fact that the necessary and sufficient properties required of a matrix @xmath5 for the pf properties to hold are still not fully understood , have led to the emergence of many generalizations .",
    "we note that whereas all generalizations concern the perron ",
    "frobenius property , the collatz ",
    "wielandt property is not always established .",
    "the long series of existing pf extensions includes @xcite .",
    "we next discuss these extensions in comparison to the current work .",
    "existing pf extensions can be broadly classified into four classes .",
    "the first concerns matrices that do not satisfy the irreducibility and nonnegativity requirements .",
    "for example , @xcite establish the perron - frobenius property for _ almost _ nonnegative matrices or _ eventually _ nonnegative matrices . a second class of generalizations concerns square matrices over different domains .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the pf theorem  was established for complex matrices @xmath27 . in the third type of generalization , the linear transformation obtained by applying the nonnegative irreducible matrix @xmath5 is generalized to a nonlinear mapping @xcite , a concave mapping @xcite or a matrix polynomial mapping @xcite .",
    "last , a much less well studied generalization deals with nonsquare matrices , i.e. , matrices in @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "note that when considering a nonsquare system , the notion of eigenvalues requires definition .",
    "there are several possible definitions for eigenvalues in nonsquare matrices .",
    "one possible setting for this type of generalizations considers a pair of nonsquare  pencil \" matrices @xmath12 , where the term  pencil \" refers to the expression @xmath30 , for @xmath31 .",
    "of special interest here are the values that reduce the pencil rank , namely , the @xmath32 values satisfying @xmath33 for some nonzero @xmath34 .",
    "this problem is known as the _ generalized eigenvalue problem _",
    "@xcite , which can be stated as follows : given matrices @xmath12 , find a vector @xmath35 , @xmath31 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "the complex number @xmath32 is said to be an _ eigenvalue of @xmath5 relative to @xmath37 _ iff @xmath38 for some nonzero @xmath34 and @xmath34 is called the _ eigenvector of @xmath5 relative to @xmath37_. the set of all eigenvalues of @xmath5 relative to @xmath37 is called the _ spectrum of @xmath5 relative to @xmath37 _ , denoted by @xmath39 .    using the above definition ,",
    "@xcite considered pairs of nonsquare matrices @xmath15 and was the first to characterize the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath37 required to establish their pf property , i.e. , guarantee that the generalized eigenpair is nonnegative .",
    "essentially , this is done by generalizing the notions of positivity and nonnegativity in the following manner .",
    "a matrix @xmath5 is said to be _ positive _ ( respectively,_nonnegative _ ) with respect to @xmath37 , if @xmath40 implies that @xmath41 ( resp . , @xmath42 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath43 , these definitions coincide with the classical definitions of a positive ( resp .",
    ", nonnegative ) matrix .",
    "let @xmath12 , for @xmath44 , be such that the rank of @xmath5 or the rank of @xmath37 is @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if @xmath5 is positive ( resp . ,",
    "nonnegative ) with respect to @xmath37 , then the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath45 has a discrete and finite spectrum , the eigenvalue with the largest absolute value is real and positive ( resp . ,",
    "nonnegative ) , and the corresponding eigenvector is positive ( resp . , nonnegative ) . observe that under the definition used therein , the cases where @xmath46 ( which is the setting studied here ) is uninteresting , as the columns of @xmath47 are linearly dependent for any real @xmath32 , and hence the spectrum @xmath39 is unbounded . despite the significance of @xcite and its pioneering generalization of the pf theorem  to nonsquare systems",
    ", it is not clear what are the applications of such a generalization , and no specific implications are known for the traditional applications of the pf theorem .",
    "moreover , although @xcite established the pf property for a class of pairs of nonsquare matrices , the collatz ",
    "wielandt property , which provides the algorithmic power for the pf theorem , does not necessarily hold with the spectral definition of @xcite .",
    "in addition , since no notion of irreducibility was defined in @xcite , the spectral radius of a nonnegative system ( in the sense of the definition of @xcite ) might be zero , and the corresponding eigenvector might be nonnegative in the strong sense ( with some zero coordinates ) .",
    "these degenerations can be handled only by considering irreducible nonnegative matrices , as was done by frobenius in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the goal of the current work is to develop the spectral theory for a pair of nonnegative matrices in a way that is both necessary and sufficient for both the pf property and the collatz ",
    "wielandt property to hold ( allowing the nonsquare system to be of the  same power \" as the square systems considered by perron and frobenius ) . towards this",
    "we define the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of pairs of @xmath48 matrices @xmath5 and @xmath37 in a novel manner .",
    "such eigenpair @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 . in @xcite ,",
    "alternative spectral definitions for pairs of nonsquare matrices @xmath5 and @xmath37 are provided .",
    "we note that whereas in @xcite formulation , the maximum eigenvalue is not bounded if @xmath51 , with our definition it is bounded .",
    "let us note that although the generalized eigenvalue problem has been studied for many years , and multiple approaches for nonsquare spectral theory in general have been developed , the algorithmic aspects of such theories with respect to the the collatz ",
    "wielandt property have been neglected when concerning nonsquare matrices ( and also in other extensions ) .",
    "this paper is the first , to the best of our knowledge , to provide spectral definitions for nonsquare systems that have the same algorithmic power as those made for square systems ( in the context of the pf theorem ) .",
    "the extended optimization problem that corresponds to this nonsquare setting is a nonconvex problem ( which is also not log - convex ) , therefore its polynomial solution and characterization are of interest .",
    "another way to extend the notion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix to a nonsquare matrix is via _ singular value decompositions ( svd ) _",
    "formally , the singular value decomposition of an @xmath52 real matrix @xmath53 is a factorization of the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an @xmath56 real or complex unitary matrix , @xmath57 is an @xmath58 diagonal matrix with nonnegative reals on the diagonal , and @xmath59 ( the conjugate transpose of @xmath60 ) is an @xmath26 real or complex unitary matrix .",
    "the diagonal entries @xmath61 of @xmath57 are known as the singular values of @xmath53 .",
    "after performing the product @xmath62 , it is clear that the dependence of the singular values of @xmath53 is linear . in case all the inputs of @xmath53 are positive , we can add the absolute value , and thus the svd has a flavor of @xmath63 dependence .",
    "in contrast to the svd definition , here we are interested in finding the maximum , so our interpretation has the flavor of @xmath64 . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "vazirani defined the notion of _ rational convex programs _ as problems that have a rational number as a solution .",
    "our paper can be considered as an example for _ algebraic programming _ , since we show that a solution to our problem is an algebraic number .",

    "this test is performed by the algorithm in a gradual manner by monotonically increasing the subsets of nodes that belong to the same strongly connected component   in every @xmath393 . in the beginning of the execution ,",
    "the most one can claim is that every entity @xmath389 is in its own strongly connected component . over time",
    ", clusters are merged while maintaining the invariant that all entities of the same cluster belong to the same strongly connected component   in every @xmath393 .",
    "more formally , the following invariant is maintained in every round @xmath395 : the entities of each cluster @xmath420 of the graph @xmath417 are guaranteed to be in the same strongly connected component   in the constraint graph @xmath393 for every selection matrix @xmath257 .",
    "we later show that if the system @xmath200 is irreducible , then the merging process never fails and therefore the last partition @xmath419 consists of a single cluster node that contains all entities , and by the invariant , all entities are guaranteed to be in the same strongly connected component   in the constraint graph of any hidden square subsystem .",
    "we now provide some high level explanation for the validity of this invariant . starting with round @xmath400",
    ", each cluster node @xmath421 is a singleton and every singleton entity is trivially in its own strongly connected component   in any constraint graph @xmath393 .",
    "assume the invariant holds up to round @xmath395 , and consider round @xmath422 .",
    "the key observation in this context is that the new partition @xmath403 is defined based on the graph @xmath423 , whose edges are independent of the specific supporter selection that is made by the entities ( and that determines the resulting hidden square subsystem ) .",
    "this holds due to the fact that a directed edge @xmath424 between the clusters @xmath425 exists if and only if there exists an entity node @xmath411 such that _ each _ of its supporter @xmath412 is a repressor of _ some _ entity @xmath413 .",
    "therefore , if the edge @xmath408 exists in the @xmath415 , then it exists also in the cluster graph corresponding to the constraint graph @xmath393 ( i.e. , the graph formed by representing every strongly connected component   of @xmath393 by a single node ) for _ every _ hidden square subsystem @xmath246 , no matter which supporter @xmath412 was selected by @xmath244 for @xmath389 .",
