    "@xmath0@xcite in its single layered form is a two valley direct band gap semiconductor with gap in the visible and so is of interest for device applications . through excitation by right and left hand polarized light excess populations of a selected valley can be generated which make this material ideal for valleytronics.@xcite because the two inequivalent valleys are separated in the brillouin zone by a large momentum , intervalley scattering should be small .",
    "consequently the valley index becomes a new degree of freedom analogous to spin in semiconductors . just like",
    "manipulating spin has lead to spintronics,@xcite manipulating valley index can produce new effects including using it to carry information .",
    "as an example , in the context of graphene xiao et.al.@xcite showed that a contrasting intrinsic magnetic moment and berry curvature can be associated with carrier valley index .",
    "as a second example a valley filter device is described by rycerz et.al.@xcite    an important issue is possible pathways to achieve valley polarization i.e. populating states preferentially in one valley.@xcite one way discussed theoretically@xcite is to use circular polarized light and this has been demonstrated recently by three experimental groups.@xcite selection rules on the absorption of right ( or left ) handed polarized light assures that this radiation excites almost exclusively charge carriers residing in a single valley with index @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "the physical quantity that comes into the description of such processes is the real part of the ac optical conductivity for right ( + 1 ) or left ( -1 ) polarization @xmath3 as a function of photon energy @xmath4 . in terms of longitudinal @xmath5 and transverse @xmath6 conductivity @xmath7 .",

    "the bands are spin polarized and a sum over spin and valley appears .",
    "the transverse conductivity is split into charge , spin and valley hall conductivity and , in all cases , depends on an overlap of the berry curvature multiplied with a common sum of two energy denominators linear in frequency plus appropriate temperature factors and channel dependent indices .",

    "the effect of temperature is considered .",
    "it provides a smearing that tends to obscure the separate contributions to the conductivity .",
    "it also can change very significantly the spin admixture in the frequency window just above the main absorption threshold where there can be an important imbalance between up and down spin , for a given valley when circular polarized light is employed .",
    "the absorptive part of the conductivity for right and left handed polarized light , which is the appropriate quantity for valleytronics is also computed , and it is found that second valley contributes very little to the absorption .",
