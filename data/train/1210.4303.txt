    "during the last decade , circuit qed based on superconducting circuits has become a promising platform to investigate strong coupling between light and matter as well as enable quantum information processing technology @xcite .",
    "some of the exciting results include the following : strong coupling between a superconducting qubit and a single photon @xcite , resolving photon - number states @xcite , synthesizing arbitrary quantum states @xcite , three - qubit quantum error correction @xcite , implementation of a toffoli gate @xcite , quantum feedback control @xcite and architectures for a superconducting quantum computer @xcite . the nonlinear properties of josephson junctions have also been used to study the dynamical casimir effect @xcite and build quantum limited amplifiers @xcite .",
    "more recently , theoretical and experimental work has begun to investigate the strong interaction between light and a single atom even without a cavity @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the destructive interference between the excited dipole radiation and the incident field gives rise to the extinction of the forward propagating wave for a weak incident field .",
    "this experiment was first demonstrated for a single atom / molecule in 3d space , where the extinction of the forward incident wave did not exceed 12@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the spatial mode mismatch between the incident and scattered waves .",
    "taking advantages of the huge dipole moment of the artificial atom and the confinement of the propagating fields in a 1d open transmission line @xcite , strong coupling between an artificial atom and propagating field can be achieved .",
    "extinctions in excess of 99% has been observed @xcite .",
    "this system represents a potential key component in the field of microwave quantum optics , which is the central scope of this article .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the elastic scattering properties of the single artificial atom is presented in section 2 .",
    "well - known quantum optics effects , such as the mollow triplet and aulter - townes splitting are presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we demonstrate two quantum devices based on these effects which operate at the single - photon level in the microwave regime , namely : the single - photon router and the photon - number filter . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the possibilities of a quantum network using these devices .",
    ", on resonance as a function of the incoming probe power , @xmath1 , for sample 1 and 2 . at low power , very little",
    "is transmitted whereas at high power practically everything is transmitted .",
    "( inset ) a weak , resonant coherent field is reflected by the atom . ]",
    "in fig . 1a , a transmon qubit @xcite is embedded in a 1d open transmission line with a characteristic impedance @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the 0 - 1 transition energy of the transmon , @xmath4 , is determined by two energies , where @xmath5 is the charging energy , @xmath6 is the total capacitance of the transmon , @xmath7 is the josephson energy which can be tuned by the external flux @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the maximum josephson energy and @xmath10 is the magnetic flux quantum .    with a coherent state input , we investigate the transmission and reflection properties of the field .",
    "the input field , transmitted field and the reflected field are denoted as @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , indicated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1a . by definition , the transmission coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "the reflection coefficient , @xmath15 , can be expressed as @xcite ,    @xmath16    where the maximum reflection amplitude is given by @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18,@xmath19 are the relaxation rate and pure dephasing rate of the 0 - 1 transition of the atom , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the 0 - 1 decoherence rate and @xmath21 is the detuning between the applied probe frequency , @xmath22 , and 0 - 1 transition frequency , @xmath23 .",
    "we see that both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are uniquely dependent on @xmath26 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath27 is the rabi oscillation frequency induced by the probe , which is proportional to @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probe power .",
    "the relaxation process is dominated by coupling to the 1d transmission line through the coupling capacitance @xmath30 ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "1a ) and assuming that photon emission to the transmission line dominates the relaxation , we find @xmath31 .        according to eq.(1 ) , for a weak @xmath32 , resonant probe @xmath33 , in the absence of both pure dephasing @xmath34 and unknown relaxation channels , we should see full reflection ( @xmath35 ) of the incoming probe field @xcite . in that case",
    ", we also have full extinction , @xmath36 , of the propagating wave .",
    "this full extinction ( perfect reflection ) can be described as a coherent interference of the incoming wave and the scattered wave from the atom .",
    "this is what we observe in fig .",
    "1b , we measure the transmittance , @xmath37 , on resonance as a function of @xmath1 with two samples .",
    "we see an extinction in the resonant microwaves of up to @xmath38 for sample 1(2 ) at low incident probe power , where @xmath39 . for increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "we see the strong nonlinearity of the atom which becomes saturated by the incident microwave photons .",
    "since the atom can only scatter one photon at a time , at high incident power , @xmath40 , most of the photons pass the atom without interaction and are thus transmitted",
    ". therefore @xmath41 tends towards unity for increasing @xmath1 , consistent with eq.(1 ) .",
    "we define the average probe photon number coming to the transmon per interaction time as , @xmath42 .",
    "we measure @xmath43 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "2 , the experimental magnitude , @xmath41 , and phase response , @xmath44 , for sample 1 are shown in a , b , respectively .",
    "the top and bottom panels display 2d plots and the corresponding line cuts indicated by the arrows , respectively . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the magnitude response shows the strong extinction of resonant microwaves , up to 70@xmath0 in amplitude or @xmath46 in power ( fig .",
    "the solid curves of fig . 2 show fits to all magnitude and phase curves simultaneously , with three fitting parameters , @xmath47mhz , @xmath48mhz and @xmath49ghz .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath50ff , @xmath51mhz and @xmath52 .",
    "we find very good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "we also see that @xmath15 varies as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath22 , as expected ( data not shown ) .    to further characterize the sample 1 , the resonance dip in transmission in fig .",
    "2a is mapped as a function of @xmath8 at a weak probe , @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "if we increase @xmath1 to a level such that the 0 - 1 transition is saturated , two - photon ( 0 - 2 ) transitions occur , as indicated in the grey curve of fig .",
    "the transition frequency corresponds to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the 1 - 2 transition energy .",
    "we use a cooper pair box @xcite hamiltonian with 50 charge states to fit the spectrum of the atom .",
    "we extract @xmath55ghz , @xmath56mhz for sample 1 .",
    "the extracted parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note that one of the josephson junction is broken in sample 3 , therefore , the transition frequency could not be tuned with @xmath8 .",
    ".[params ] parameters for samples 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "all values in ghz ( except for the extinction and @xmath57 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the extinction efficiency of sample 2 is much better than sample 1 .",
    "this is because sample 1 has a low @xmath58 , which is barely in the transmon limit . for this value of @xmath57",
    ", charge noise still plays an important role as the energy band of the 0 - 1 transition is still dependent on charge @xcite . for sample 1",
    "we find the charge dispersion is 7mhz and the dephasing is dominated by charge noise . by increasing @xmath57 to 31 , we see much less dephasing in sample 2 , which gives nearly perfect extinction of propagating resonant microwaves . note that , the anharmonicity between @xmath23 and @xmath54 of sample 2 is close to @xmath59 .",
    "this is not quite the case for sample 1 due to its low @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the transmon also has higher level transitions , in particular , we are interested in the 1 - 2 transition with frequency , @xmath54 . by using 2-tone spectroscopy , the @xmath54 transition can be directly measured .",
    "we can saturate the @xmath23 transition by applying a pump field at @xmath60 ghz , and measure the transmission properties using a weak probe @xmath61 . as the pump power is increased , the population of the first excited state increases , therefore",
    ", we start to observe photon scattering from the 1 - 2 transition , which appears as a dip in transmission at @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "the dip in transmission grows until the 0 - 1 transition becomes fully saturated . from this , we extract @xmath63ghz for sample 1 . therefore , the two - photon ( 0 - 2 ) transition should be equal to 6.74 ghz , consistent with the observation in fig .",
    "the linewidth of @xmath54 is around 120mhz , this dephasing mainly comes from the charge dispersion . further increasing the pump power at @xmath23 , we observe the well known mollow triplet @xcite ( fig .",
    "4b , sample 3 ) .",
    "the rabi splitting of the triplet can be used to calibrate the power at the atom .",
    "the mollow triplet can be explained in the dressed state picture , where the two lowest levels split by the rabi frequency .",
    "these four states give three different transitions , indicated by red , brown and blue arrows in the inset of fig .",
    "4b . note that the way we observed the triplet here is different from that in @xcite .",
    "we probe the transmission of these triplet transitions instead of looking at the emission spectrum .",
    "we see that the center transition is much less visible , because we pump at the frequency which saturates the transition .        with a weak resonant probe field , @xmath64 , and a strong resonant",
    ", @xmath65 , control field , the 0 - 1 resonance dip splits with the magnitude of @xmath66 @xcite , this is known as the aulter - townes splitting(ats ) @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and phase response are shown in fig . 4c and 4d respectively . in the magnitude response",
    ", we see that the transmon becomes transparent for the probe at @xmath67 at sufficiently high control power . in the phase response",
    ", we see the probe phase , @xmath44 , depends on the control power , @xmath68 .    in the following application section ,",
    "we demonstrate two devices based on these effects which could be utilized in a microwave quantum network . by making use of the ats ,",
    "we demonstrate a router for single photons . by using the high nonlinearity of the atom ,",
    "we demonstrate a photon - number filter , where we convert classical coherent microwaves to a nonclassical microwave field .",
    "the operation principle of the single - photon router is explained as follows . in the time domain ( see fig .",
    "5a ) , we input a constant weak probe in the single - photon regime , @xmath69 , at @xmath67 . we then apply a strong control pulse , around 30db more than the probe power , at the @xmath54 frequency .",
    "when the control is off , the probe photons are reflected by the atom , and delivered to output port 1 .",
    "when the control is on , the probe photons are transmitted based on ats , and delivered to output port 2 .",
    "we measure the reflected and transmitted probe power simultaneously in the time domain .",
    "this is crucial to investigate if the microwave photon transport is a fully coherent process , @xmath70 the transmission dip seen in fig .",
    "2a is that the photons are being reflected ( not due to dissipation ) .",
    "note that we are phase sensitive since we measure @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 , this means that we are only sensitive to the coherent part of the signal .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig . 5a .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "5b , c with two different control pulses for sample 2 . in fig .",
    "5b ( c ) , we use a square ( gaussian ) control pulse with a duration of 1 @xmath73 ( 10 ns ) .",
    "as expected , when the control signal is on , the probe power of the transmitted signal is increased and we see a corresponding decrease in the reflected probe signal . @xmath74",
    "probe on - off ratio is achieved in both reflection and transmission for sample 2 .",
    "we also see that the on - off ratio does not depend on the control time . in fig .",
    "5c , the time resolution of our digitizer detector / arbitrary waveform generator is 5 ns , which prevents us from accurately measuring pulses less than about 10 ns .",
    "the response follows nicely with the waveform of the control pulse . the ringing appearing in fig .",
    "5b are artifacts of the digitizer . in the setup of fig .",
    "5a , we send @xmath23 and @xmath54 in opposite direction with respect to each other .",
    "we can also send pulses in the same direction by using a microwave combiner at one of the input ports and get the same results , as expected .",
    "note that we use the on - off ratio here @xcite , because it is not possible to do a full calibration of the background reflections in the line and leakage through circulator 1 [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] .    the speed of our router sample 1(2 )",
    "is predicted to be @xmath75 2 ns ( 4 ns ) .",
    "we show that the router works well down to the time limit of our instruments . by engineering the relaxation rate ,",
    "it should be possible to achieve switching times in the sub nanosecond regime .",
    "in addition , the routing efficiency , @xmath76 , can be improved by further reducing @xmath19 .",
    "the improvement in sample 2 compared to sample 1 was achieved by increasing the @xmath57 ratio .",
    "this reduced the sensitivity to the charge noise and therefore the dephasing .",
    "our router can also easily be cascaded to distribute photons to many output channels .",
    "6a shows 4 atoms ( a , b , c , d ) in series , each separated by a circulator .",
    "the @xmath23 of the atoms are the same , while the @xmath54 are different .",
    "this arrangement can be designed in a straightforward manner by controlling the ratio of @xmath57 . by turning on and off control tones at the various 1 - 2 transition frequencies of different atoms",
    ", we can determine the output channel of the probe field , according to the table of fig .",
    "6b . for instance , if we want to send the probe field to channel 4 , we apply three control tones at @xmath77,@xmath78 .",
    "note that regardless of the number of output channels , all the control tones and the probe tone can be input through the same input port .",
    "theoretically , the maximum number of output channels depends on the ratio of the anharmonicity and the width of the 1 - 2 transition , @xmath79 .",
    "thus , there is a trade off between efficiency and the number of outputs .          in fig.1b",
    ", we demonstrated the nonlinear nature of the artificial atom .",
    "this naturally comes from the fact that atoms can only reflect one photon at a time . to reveal the nonclassical character of the reflected field , we investigate the statistics of the reflected field .",
    "in particular , in this section , we show that the reflected field is antibunched @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also show that the transmitted fields is superbunched @xcite .",
    "the incident coherent state can be written in terms of a superposition of photon number states , with a poissonian distribution . for a weak probe field with @xmath80 , this coherent field can be approximated using a basis of the first three - photon number states . for a one - photon incident state ,",
    "the atom reflects it , leading to antibunching in the reflected field . together with the zero - photon state ,",
    "the reflected field still maintains first - order coherence , as there is a well defined phase between the zero and one photon states . because the atom is not able to scatter more than one photon at a time ,",
    "a two - photon incident state has a much higher probability of transmission , leading to superbunching in the transmitted field @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our single artificial atom acts as a photon - number filter , which filters and reflects the one - photon number state from a coherent state .",
    "this process leads to a photon - number redistribution between the reflected and transmitted fields @xcite .    a schematic illustration of the measurement setup is shown in fig .",
    "this allows us to measure hanbury brown - twiss @xcite type power - power correlations .",
    "we apply a resonant coherent microwave field at @xmath67 , depending on whether we send the input through circulator 1 or 2 , we measure the statistics of the reflected or transmitted field , respectively .",
    "the signal then propagates to a beam splitter , which in the microwave domain is realized by a hybrid coupler , where the outputs of the beam splitter are connected to two nominally identical hemt amplifiers with system noise temperatures of approximately 7 k. we assume that the amplifier noise generated in the two independent detection chains is uncorrelated . after further amplification ,",
    "the two voltage amplitudes of the outputs are captured by a pair of vector digitizers .",
    "the second order correlation function @xcite provides a statistical tool to characterize the field , it can be expressed as @xmath81[\\left \\langle p_2(t)\\right \\rangle-\\left",
    "\\langle p_{2,n}(t ) \\right \\rangle]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the delay time between the two digitizers , @xmath83 are the output powers in ports 1 and 2 , respectively , see fig . 7a .",
    "@xmath84 are the amplifier noise in ports 1 and 2 respectively , when the incident source is off .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 $ ] represents the net power of the field from output port i , where @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the covariance of the output powers in ports 1 and 2 , defined as @xmath88 .",
    "we had a trigger jitter of @xmath89 sample between the two digitizers . to minimize the effect of this trigger jitter , we oversample and then digitally filter ( average ) the data in all the @xmath90 measurements . here ,",
    "the sampling frequency is set to @xmath91 samples / s with a digital filter with a bandwidth bw=55 mhz applied to each digitizer for all measurements . for a coherent state",
    ", we find @xmath92 with the qubit detuned from @xmath23 .    in fig .",
    "7b , we plot the measured @xmath93 of the reflected field from our atom . at low powers , where @xmath69 , we clearly observe antibunching of the field @xcite .",
    "the trace here was averaged over @xmath94 measured quadrature field samples .",
    "the antibunching behavior at @xmath95 dbm ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 , reveals the nonclassical character of the field .",
    "ideally , we would find @xmath98 as the atom can only reflect one photon at a time .",
    "the non - zero @xmath99 we measured originates from four effects : 1 ) a thermal field at 50 mk temperature , 2 ) a finite filter bw , 3 ) trigger jitter between the two digitizers and 4 ) stray fields including background reflections in the line and leakage through circulator 1 [ fig .",
    "the complete theory curves include all four non - idealities , the partial theory curves include 1 ) and 2 ) , but not 3 ) , 4 ) .",
    "the effects of these factors on our measured antibunching are shown in the theory plot fig .",
    "7c . for small bw , within the long sampling time , the atom is able to scatter multiple photons .",
    "if bw @xmath100 , the antibunching dip we measure vanishes entirely . this interplay between bw and @xmath27 yields a power dependent @xmath99 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "7b . in the ideal case ,",
    "@xmath70 for a sufficiently wide bw ( 1 ghz ) at 0 mk , the theory gives @xmath98 , as expected .    in fig .",
    "8a , we see superbunching of the photons @xcite with @xmath101 at @xmath102 dbm ( @xmath103 ) for the transmitted field .",
    "superbunching occurs because the one - photon state of the incident field has been selectively reflected and thus filtered out from the transmitted signal , while the two - photon state is more likely transmitted .",
    "the three - photon state and higher number states are negligible .",
    "the transmitted state generated from our qubit is thus bunched even more than a thermal state , which has @xmath104 .",
    "8b shows the theoretical curves of @xmath93 transmitted field under the influence of various effects .",
    "for the case of bw=1 ghz at 0 mk , indicated by the black curve , @xmath90 exhibits very strong bunching at @xmath105 . at a later @xmath82(@xmath106 15 ns ) , @xmath90 for the transmitted field even appears antibunched @xcite , this is however not resolved in the experimental data .",
    "for the other curves , we see the degrading of superbunching due to the influence of bw , temperature and jitter . in fig .",
    "8c , we plot @xmath99 as a function of incident power , and clearly see the ( super)bunching behavior decrease as the incident power increases . for high powers , where @xmath107 , we find @xmath92 .",
    "this is because most of the coherent signal then passes through the transmission line without interacting with the qubit owing to saturation of the atomic response .",
    "we also plot the theoretical curves ( blue ) at 0 mk for two different bw .",
    "a single - mode resonator is used to model the digital filter .",
    "the theoretical curves in fig . 7 and 8 are based on a master equation describing both the transmon and the resonator using the formalism of cascaded quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the trigger jitter is modeled by the following : the value of @xmath93 at each point is replaced by the average value of @xmath108 - 10 ns ) , @xmath93 and @xmath108 + 10 ns ) .",
    "we extract 50 mk from all these fits , with no additional free fitting parameters .    as we have shown , the single artificial atom acts as a photon - number filter , which selectively filters out the one - photon number state from a coherent state .",
    "this provides a novel way to generate single microwave photons @xcite .",
    "microwave quantum optics with a single artificial atom opens up a novel way of building up a quantum network based on superconducting circuits .",
    "in such a system , superconducting processors can act as quantum nodes , which can be linked by quantum channels , to transfer flying photons ( quantum information ) from site to site on chip with high fidelity . in this way",
    ", the single - photon router can switch quantum information on nanosecond timescales and with 99% efficiency , with the possibility of multiple outputs .",
    "the photon - number filter can act as the source of generation of flying microwave photons .",
    "these components have the advantage of wide frequency range compared to cavity - based systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent development of cross - kerr phase shifter at the single - photon level based on superconducting circuit is also beneficial for a microwave quantum network @xcite .    while microwave quantum optics with artificial atoms is a promising technology for quantum information processing , optical photons have clearly advantages on long distance quantum communication via a quantum channel .",
    "the development of hybrid quantum network would combine both advantages of these two systems .",
    "the early stages of optical - microwave interface have been demonstrated @xcite , with other potential coupling mechanisms under investigation @xcite .",
    "based on superconducting circuits , we study various fundamental quantum optical effects with a single artificial atom , such as photon scattering , mollow triplet and aulter - townes splitting .",
    "we further demonstrate two potential elements for an on chip quantum network : the single - photon router and the photon - number filter .",
