    "spin effects are known to provide sensitive tests for the underlying particle theories in many cases .",
    "one may recall the spin asymmetries in pion - nucleon scattering which can not be described in the simplest pole approximation of the regge theory and require to take into account cuts . in the case of qcd",
    "the so - called emc spin crisis was a signal of a breakdown of the naive parton model and of the importance of the incorporation of such a subtle field theory effect as the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "a less popular , but also extremely interesting example is the problem of single transverse spin asymmetries in reactions mediated by strong interactions .",
    "as these effects require a mass parameter and an imaginary part in the scattering amplitude , they are proportional to @xmath0 in the naive perturbative approach . however",
    ", a careful application of qcd factorization at twist-3 level removes both of these small parameters @xcite .",
    "the collective gluon field of the hadron is shifting the current quark mass @xmath1 to a mass parameter of the order of the hadron mass and , simultaneously , provides the imaginary part .",
    "technically , the latter appears when the pole of the quark ( or gluon @xcite ) propagator is integrated over the light - cone momentum fraction .",
    "a similar imaginary part is present in the qcd higher twist contributions to dilepton production in pion - nucleon scattering , due to the integration over the light - cone momentum fraction of the quark in the pion .",
    "this effect leads  in the case of unpolarized nucleon targets to a significant contribution to the dilepton angular distribution @xcite , which is sensitive to different anstze for the pion distribution function .",
    "it is interesting to look for single spin asymmetries for which the imaginary part does not constitute a ( large ) correction , but the whole contribution .",
    "the natural candidate is the spin asymmetry in the production of dileptons from the scattering of pions on a _ longitudinally polarized _ nucleon .",
    "this spin asymmetry has been thoroughly studied in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the analogous mesonic processes have been discussed in @xcite . in the present work we study this single spin asymmetry , taking into account pion bound state effects .",
    "we will consider the inclusive production of muon pairs from the scattering of a pion on a polarized proton ( the drell - yan process ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the degree of longitudinal polarization of the proton , and all momenta refer to the overall c.m . system .",
    "it is convenient to write the differential cross section for ( [ react ] ) in terms of a hadronic and a leptonic tensor , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hadronic c.m . energy .",
    "the leptonic tensor has the well - known form @xmath6 note that @xmath7 is symmetric , since we only consider the exchange of a virtual photon ( not a @xmath8 boson ) and since we sum over the polarizations of @xmath9 .",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath10 may be written as @xmath11 only the symmetric part of @xmath10 is relevant after contraction with @xmath12 of eq .",
    "( [ leptonictensor ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath10 in the following is implicitly assumed to be symmetrized .",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath13 in ( [ react ] ) may be parametrized as @xmath14 here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are angles defined in the muon pair rest frame , and @xmath17 are angle independent coefficients .",
    "they depend on @xmath18 ( the virtuality of the photon ) , @xmath19 ( the squared transverse momentum of the photon in the hadronic c.m.s . ) , and on @xmath20 ( the longitudinal momentum fraction of the photon ) .",
    "we take @xmath21 for a photon moving forward with respect to the pion in the hadronic c.m .",
    "the normalization of the cross section can be determined from @xmath22    the normalization @xmath23 and the angular coefficients are related to the helicity amplitudes of the hadronic tensor : @xmath24 where the polarization vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 are determined by specifying the coordinate axes @xmath27 in the muon rest frame .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 are nonzero only in the polarized drell - yan process and are induced by absorptive parts in the scattering amplitude @xmath30 . in the parton model ,",
    "the leading contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath29 come from the interference of born diagrams with the absorptive parts of one - loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "the relation of the single spin asymmetry @xmath31 to the angular coefficients is simply given by @xmath32    for the unpolarized drell - yan process the parton model predictions @xcite fail to describe the data on @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , taking into account pion bound state effects yields reasonable fits to the data @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of this bound state model is a nonvanishing absorptive part in _ leading _ order which is proportional to the pion distribution amplitude @xmath35 .",
    "this property directly leads to nonvanishing @xmath28 and @xmath29 which are strongly sensitive to @xmath35 . in the following",
    "we will shortly describe the salient features of the bound state model for the pion.further details may be found , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite .    the bound state problem may be treated perturbatively if the momentum fraction of the quark from the pion is large , which is the case for large @xmath36 . the dominant contribution to",
    "the drell - yan process comes from the annihilation of a quark with an antiquark @xcite . in the region of large @xmath36 ,",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "then give the leading contributions .",
    "we will explain the formalism for the annihilation of a @xmath37 quark from the proton with the @xmath38 quark from the pion ; the other possible annihilation process of a @xmath39 quark from the proton with the @xmath40 quark from the pion is treated in complete analogy and its contribution will later be added incoherently .    in diagram 1a",
    "we see that the @xmath38 quark propagator is far off - shell , @xmath41 , if the light cone momentum fraction of the quark from the pion @xmath42 is close to 1 @xcite .",
    "thus , the pion can be resolved by a single hard gluon exchange @xcite . the second diagram , fig .",
    "1b , is required by gauge invariance .",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath10 is obtained by a convolution of the partonic tensor @xmath43 with the corresponding parton distribution functions for the polarized proton , @xmath44 . ] .",
    "the partonic tensor @xmath43 is computed from the product @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the amplitude for the reaction @xmath47 where the arrow indicates the polarization of the parton .",
    "this amplitude @xmath46 is obtained by convoluting the partonic amplitude @xmath48 with the pion distribution amplitude @xmath49 @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the cutoff for the integration over soft momenta in the definition of @xmath35 , @xmath52 is the pion decay constant , and @xmath53 is the number of colors . a detailed discussion of the scale setting problem for exclusive processes is given in @xcite .",
    "using the commensurate scale relations in the calculation of ( [ convdist ] ) would allow to eliminate ambiguities caused by the factorization and renormalization .",
    "however , this does not change the qualitative features of our predictions and thus it will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "the imaginary part in this model arises because the internal quark line of fig .",
    "1b can go on - shell .",
    "after integrating the hard scattering amplitude @xmath54 according to equation ( [ convdist ] ) , we are left with a regular amplitude @xmath46 which has an imaginary part proportional to the pion distribution amplitude at the point where the quark propagator gets singular .",
    "we are now ready to present our analytic results .",
    "we relegate the full result for the hadronic tensor to the appendix , and confine ourselves here to a discussion of the angular coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 . to present our results for the angular distribution we choose the gottfried - jackson frame where the @xmath55 axis is taken to be the pion direction in the muon rest frame and the @xmath56 axis lies in the @xmath57 plane such that the proton momentum has a negative @xmath58 component . from eqs .",

    "finally , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the unpolarized and polarized valence and sea quark distribution functions evaluated at the point @xmath68 .",
    "the results for @xmath69 within the pion bound state model are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the angular coefficient functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , eq . ( [ mubarnubar ] ) , depend on @xmath61 , @xmath63 , the pion distribution amplitude and on the ratio of the polarized and unpolarized quark distribution functions of the proton . whereas the unpolarized quark distributions are known quite well , the polarized ones still contain large uncertainties . for our results",
    "we choose the parametrizations given in @xcite at @xmath70 .    in fig .  2 we present our results for several distribution amplitudes @xmath35 that are quite different in shape",
    "2a shows our choices for @xmath35 : the solid line represents the two - humped function @xcite which gave a good fit to the data on @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the effective evolution parameter is set to @xmath71 . since the predictions are also very sensitive to the behavior of the distribution amplitude in the endpoint region , we choose two different parametrizations @xcite for the convex distribution amplitude @xmath72 . the dashed line in fig .",
    "2a represents the asymptotical amplitude , i.e. , @xmath73 , and the dotted line shows a narrow distribution amplitude with @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "2b the moment @xmath75 is plotted in arbitrary units versus @xmath36 for the values @xmath76 , @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev .",
    "it can be seen that different shapes of the distribution amplitude could be distinguished by a measurement of this quantity , which is proportional to the pion distribution amplitude evaluated at @xmath79 ( cf . the numerator of ( [ mubarnubar ] ) ) .",
    "it is also demonstrated that narrow distribution amplitudes give a moment which vanishes in the large @xmath36 region .    in figs .  2c and 2d the angular coefficient @xmath80",
    "is plotted versus @xmath36 for two different choices of @xmath81 and the same values for @xmath5 and @xmath82 as in fig .",
    "2b . in fig .",
    "2c @xmath81 was set again to @xmath83 gev , which gives the moderate value @xmath84 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the two - humped form for @xmath35 induces a minimum at @xmath85 which , however , vanishes for the smaller value @xmath86 used in fig .",
    "2d . for very narrow distribution amplitudes @xmath28",
    "is strongly suppressed . since @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "( [ mubarnubar ] ) ) in the bound state model , we do not show separate plots for this quantity .",
    "note that the effects of a variation of the pion distribution amplitude in the spin - dependent and spin - averaged cross sections ",
    "i.e. in the numerator and denominator of ( [ mubarnubar ] )  partially compensate each other . as a consequence",
    ", the result for the two - humped distribution amplitude appears in between the results for the two convex distributions .",
    "the spin - dependent part of the cross section is a more sensitive `` partonometer '' , than the dimensionless coefficients @xmath88 .",
    "although the former quantity suffers from larger uncertainties due to higher order corrections , , one may expect only a small uncertainty for the determination of the shape of pion distribution amplitude , if the @xmath36 dependence of the corrections is weak .",
    "although the naive parton model is at variance with the unpolarized angular distribution @xcite , we would like to present for completeness and comparison also the predictions of this model for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we took the analytic results from @xcite and again used the parton distribution functions of @xcite . in the range @xmath89 the parton model yields coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath90 which are positive and to a very good approximation independent of @xmath36 .",
    "for the same values used in fig2b and 2c , i.e. @xmath91 and @xmath92 we get a value of @xmath93 .",
    "this means that bound state effects are roughly of the same magnitude but opposite in sign compared to the parton model at moderate values of @xmath63 . for the smaller value @xmath94",
    "we find @xmath95 , again independent of @xmath36 and positive .",
    "at such a small value of @xmath63 the bound state model predicts that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are concentrated at large @xmath36 for not too narrow distribution amplitudes . in the kinematical range",
    "considered , the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath28 calculated within the parton model takes a similar form as in the bound state model , namely , @xmath96 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that experiments on dimuon production from the scattering of pions on polarized targets will give detailed information both on the shape and on the endpoint behavior of the pion distribution amplitude .",
