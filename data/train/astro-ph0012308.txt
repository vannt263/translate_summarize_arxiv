    "it is one of longstanding and remarkable problems on formation and evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) how interstellar gas can be fueled to the central massive black hole ( hereafter referred to as mbh ) in galaxies ( e.g. , shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ; shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ) .",
    "the central core of this fueling problem is on how the angular momentum of interstellar gas can be reduced by more than several orders of magnitude in order that the gas can be transferred into the central sub - parsec of a galaxy ( shlosman et al .",
    "shlosman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) proposed the so - called ` bars within bars scheme ' as a possible mechanism for fueling agn .",
    "they showed analytically that for suitable conditions the gas inflow induced by bar instability again produces the self - gravitating disk in a smaller region and a new small bar develops , which induces further gas inflow .",
    "friedli & martinet ( 1993 ) numerically studied the dynamical evolution of doubly nested bars and found that for suitable conditions the gas inflow to the nuclear region is derived by the dissolution of the secondary smaller bar in a two - bar system .",
    "bekki & noguchi ( 1994 ) found that the dynamical heating by two sinking cores and subsequent dissipative cloud - cloud collisions in a merger can drive a larger fraction of gas to the central 10 pc .",
    "these theoretical studies essentially stressed the importance of non - axisymmetric and time - dependent gravitational potential in gaseous inflow into the central sub - parsec regions .",
    "shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) presented an alternative and important point of view that for a strongly self - gravitating disk , gas clumps formed from local gravitational instability can quickly fall toward the nuclear region around the mbh owing to dynamical friction .",
    "noguchi ( 1998 ) furthermore demonstrated that these massive clumps are more likely to be formed in the early disk formation phase when disk galaxies have a larger amount of gas .",
    "these two numerical studies stressed the importance of discrete gas clumps ( not continuous and diffuse gas ) in gas fueling processes .",
    "recent observational studies on ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , some of which are suggested to contain mbhs ( sanders et al . 1988 ) , have revealed that most of ulirgs show compact blue knots that are probably very young star clutters with the masses of @xmath5 @xmath3 ( e.g. , surace et al 1998 ) .",
    "shaya et al .",
    "( 1994 ) furthermore revealed a number of bright and possibly young star clusters in the core of ulirg arp 220 and suggested that these clusters can be very quickly transferred to the inner tens pc within an order of @xmath6 years owing to dynamical friction .",
    "since these observed clusters could be formed by massive gaseous clumps ( e.g. , massive molecular clouds ) , the above observational results lead us to suggest that gaseous clumps are also transferred to the vicinity of mbhs .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate numerically merging between a central massive black hole with the mass of @xmath7 @xmath2 @xmath3 and a spherical gaseous clump with the mass of @xmath7 @xmath2 @xmath3 and the size of @xmath7 10 pc .",
    "we demonstrate that strong tidal field of the mbh can transform the clump into a moderately thick gaseous disk ( or torus ) : the mbh can form the surrounding nuclear disk for itself .",
    "we suggest that the viscosity of the gaseous disk could transfer the gas furthermore to the vicinity of the mbh and grow the mbh .",
    "based on the present numerical results , we furthermore provide several implications on recent observational results , such as active star formation around mbh in the galaxy ( e.g. , morris & serabyn 1996 ) , apparently double m31 nuclei ( e.g. , kormendy & bender 1999 ) , and nuclear gaseous disks observed in some galaxies such as ngc 4261 ( e.g. , jaffe et al . 1993 ) .",
    "importance of tidal disruption of stars passing by a central mbh in the accretion disk was already suggested by gurzadyan & ozernoy ( 1979 ) and there are several numerical studies investigating tidal disruption of @xmath8 clusters ( e.g. , charlton & laguna 1995 ; emsellem & combes 1997 ; bekki 2000 ) .",
    "however , it is highly uncertain how a merger between a mbh and a massive @xmath9 clump dynamically evolves .",
    "thus we consider that the present study not only presents a solution of the fueling problem of agn but also provides a clue to the origin of nuclear structure of galaxies .",
    "we consider a merger between a central massive black hole ( mbh ) with the mass of @xmath10 and a gaseous clump with the mass of @xmath11 and the size of @xmath12 in the central region of a galactic bulge . from now on , all the mass and length are measured in units of @xmath10 and @xmath12 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath13 = @xmath14 and @xmath15 = @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study .",
    "if we adopt @xmath10 = @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) @xmath3 and @xmath12 = 10 pc as a fiducial value , then @xmath13 = 6.5 @xmath20 10 ( 2.1 @xmath20 @xmath21 ) km / s and @xmath15 = 1.49 @xmath20 @xmath22 ( 4.72 @xmath20 @xmath23 ) yr , respectively . both the mbh and the clump are assumed to feel external gravitational field of the bulge component .",
    "the mbh is assumed to be initially located at the center of the bulge and the initial separation between the mbh and the clump is set to be 3@xmath12 . for the radial density profile of the bulge , we adopt the universal profile proposed by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that the scale length is equal to 10@xmath12 and determine the central density so that total mass of the bulge within 200@xmath12 ( @xmath7 2 kpc ) is 200@xmath10",
    ". the adopted ratio of bulge mass to mbh one is well within a reasonable value derived by faber et al .",
    "the total mass of the bulge within @xmath24 = 1.0 ( the central 10 pc ) , where @xmath24 is the distance from the center of the bulge , is hereafter represented by @xmath25 .",
    "we model a @xmath26 = 1 polytropic gas sphere in hydrostatic equilibrium for the initial density profile of the clump . for the fiducial model , the mass ratio @xmath11/@xmath10 and @xmath25/@xmath10",
    "are set to be 1.0 and 0.3 , respectively . for this case ,",
    "the tidal radius of the mbh is nearly the same as the size of the clump .",
    "we describe the gaseous nature of the clump by using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( introduced by lucy 1977 and gingold & monaghan 1977 ) in which the fluid is modeled as a collection of fluid elements .",
    "the gas clump is assumed to be polytropic gas with the equation of state represented by @xmath27 = @xmath28 , where @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are pressure , constant , density , and the ratio of specific heat ( 2 for the adopted value of @xmath26 = 1 polytrope ) , respectively .",
    "the initial orbital plane of the merger is assumed to be exactly the same as the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane .",
    "initial @xmath32 and @xmath33 position ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) is set to be ( 0,0 ) for the mbh and ( 3,0 ) for the clump in all models .",
    "initial @xmath32 and @xmath33 velocity ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) is set to be ( 0,0 ) for the mbh and ( 0 , 0.75@xmath36 ) for the clump in the fiducial model , where @xmath36 is the circular velocity at the initial position of the clump .",
    "the number of particles for the clump is 5000 and the parameter of gravitational softening is set to be fixed at 2.97 @xmath20 @xmath37 in our units for all the simulations . by using the treesph code originally proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) , we carry out all the calculations related to the above dynamical evolution of mergers . using the above model",
    ", we mainly describe morphological , structural , and kinematical properties of the merger remnant in the fiducial model .",
    "moreover we summarize briefly the dependence of mass distribution of merger remnant on the initial merger parameters such as @xmath10 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "more details on the parameter dependences will be described in our future papers .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of mass distribution of a gaseous clump in the fiducial merger model .",
    "as the clump becomes close to the mbh , strong tidal gravitational field draws out the clump and consequently the outer part of the clump winds itself round the mbh ( @xmath38 = 6 ) . during this strong tidal disruption , angular momentum redistribution of the merger proceeds very efficiently and consequently a gaseous tidal tail is formed ( @xmath38 = 10 and 14 ) .",
    "the mbh s tidal field finally transforms the initially spherical shape of the clump into a moderately thick gaseous disk with a remarkable tidal tail after merging ( @xmath38 = 16 and 20 ) . during this morphological transformation ,",
    "the initial orbital angular momentum of the clump is efficiently changed into the intrinsic angular momentum of the forming disk around the mbh . as a natural result of this",
    ", the developed disk clearly shows rotation .",
    "the vertical scale height of the developed disk depends mainly on the initial half - mass radius of the clump ( for the present polytropic gas model ) .",
    "as is shown in figure 2 , the developed nuclear gaseous disk clearly shows strong asymmetry both in surface density profile and in rotation curve along @xmath32 and @xmath33 axis owing to the presence of one tidal arm .",
    "the radial density profile has a flat peak around @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) @xmath40 0 , where some fraction of gas is accumulated in the vicinity of the mbh .",
    "owing to the self - gravity of the developed disk and the bulge s gravitational field ( and the asymmetric mass distribution ) , the disk does not so clearly show the keplerian rotation profile , though the gravitational field of the point mass is rather strong . as merging proceeds",
    ", the gas of the clump can be efficiently accumulated around mbh ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the gas mass within @xmath24 = 0.1 in our units ( corresponding to 1 pc ) , where @xmath24 is the distance from the mbh , rapidly increases at @xmath38 = 8 and finally amounts to @xmath7 0.04 in our units ( corresponding to 4 @xmath20 @xmath4 @xmath3 ) at @xmath38 = 20 .",
    "this result implies that merging between a mbh and a gas clump can very efficiently transfer gas to the surrounding of the mbh and consequently form an agn : a mbh can provide gaseous fuel for it for itself because of its strong tidal gravitational field .",
    "it depends mainly on the mass ratio of @xmath41 whether a nuclear disk around mbh is formed after merging ( and tidal interaction ) . as is shown in figure 4 , the gas clump is only slightly distorted by the tidal gravitational field of the mbh for the model with larger @xmath41 ( i.e. , smaller @xmath10 and weaker tidal field of mbh ) so that no disks can be formed . for the model with smaller @xmath41 ( i.e. , larger @xmath10 )",
    ", on the other hand , the spherical shape of the clump is finally transformed into a moderately thick torus ( or a disk with a central hole ) around the mbh .",
    "furthermore the morphology of the central gaseous structure depends on the present model parameters . in the model with rather small initial angular momentum ( @xmath34 = 0.0 and @xmath35 = 0.2@xmath36 )",
    ", the clump merges with the mbh to form a spherical clump with the mbh gravitationally trapped in the central region of the clump ( i.e. , no tidal disruption of the clump ) . a larger eccentric gaseous disk with the steeper radial density profile is formed in the model with larger initial orbital angular momentum ( @xmath34 = @xmath42 and @xmath35 = 0.75@xmath36 ) .",
    "only a considerably small gaseous disk around the mbh is formed owing to gas transfer in the model in which the mbh and the clump encounter in a hyperbolic way ( @xmath34 = @xmath43 and @xmath35 = 0.75@xmath36 ) .",
    "these dependences imply that nuclear gaseous structure around a mbh in a galaxy is determined by orbital parameters of a merger and the mass of the mbh .",
    "the present numerical results provide the following five implications on the nuclear structure and activities of galaxies .",
    "recently hubble space telescope ( @xmath44 ) observations have revealed nuclear gaseous disks with the size ranging from @xmath7 1 pc to @xmath7 1 kpc in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , jaffe et al . 1993 , 1999 ) .",
    "our results firstly suggest that not the continuous gaseous inflow but the successive and sporadic merging of discrete gas clumps ( or gas - rich small dwarf galaxies ) onto a mbh can be one of essentially important and basic processes of the nuclear gaseous disk formation .",
    "secondly , our results provide a more detailed description of gas fueling from the central 10 pc to sub - parsec around mbhs . after the formation of a nuclear disk with the size of @xmath7 10 pc due to merging between a mbh and a gas clump ,",
    "the gas in the disk can be transferred to the vicinity of the mbh within the viscosity time scale of @xmath0 yr ( e.g. , jaffe et al . 1999 ) . even if a mbh is not so large as to tidally disrupt a clump ( for the present model with smaller @xmath10 ) , the mbh trapped within the central high density core of the clump could grow owing to bondi - type ( bondi 1952 ) accretion .",
    "we accordingly point out that the merging could provide ideal gas fueling for mbhs .",
    "we furthermore suggest that since gas clumps are more likely to be formed and transferred to the nuclear regions in higher redshift galaxies ( noguchi 1998 ) , mbhs can more rapidly grow owing to gaseous accretion and consequently show more pronounced nuclear activities at higher redshift .",
    "thirdly , the present model ( with larger @xmath10 ) showing the formation of gas torus implies that the obscuring torus proposed for explaining the origin of the dichotomy between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies in the unified model ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) could be associated with merging between a mbh and gas clumps .",
    "since gas rich clumps are more likely to be formed in gas - rich disks with the gas fraction larger than 0.1 ( shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) , the present study suggests that late - type disk galaxies are more likely to show seyfert 2 type activities with possible obscuring torus .",
    "fourthly , the present model implies that if star formation is included and assumed to be dependent on gaseous density , high density regions of the developed nuclear disk around mbh can efficiently form stars : ` mini ' starburst is triggered by merging between mbhs and gas clumps .",
    "we furthermore suggest that a young central cluster of blue stars observed in the very center of the galaxy ( e.g. , morris & serabyn 1996 ) is a fossil record of the past merging event .",
    "fifthly , the present study provides a new clue to the origin of m31 nucleus having two distinct brightness peaks with the separation of @xmath7 2 pc ( see kormendy & bender 1999 for recent high - resolution observational results ) .",
    "although tremaine ( 1995 ) recently proposed a new idea that the m31 s nucleus is actually a single thick eccentric disk ( with the mass of the order of @xmath0 @xmath3 ) surrounding the central mbh , it is highly unclear how the disk was formed .",
    "our results imply that if a smaller gaseous clump with the mass of @xmath7 @xmath0 merges with the mbh and if the later star formation transforms the formed gaseous disk into the stellar one , the proposed m31 s eccentric disk is formed ( in this point , bekki 2000 has already presented an alternative idea on the m31 s nucleus formation ) .",
    "although some of the above several suggestions could be somehow over - interpretation of the present numerical results , we lastly stress that merging between a mbh and gas clumps can be an important driver of nucleus evolution in galaxies ."
