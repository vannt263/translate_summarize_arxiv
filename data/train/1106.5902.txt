    "some of the remaining goals at rhic are to search for the signals of phase boundary and critical point ( cp )  @xcite .",
    "these form the main motivations for the rhic bes program . in pursuit of which",
    ", it was first established that rhic ( both accelerator and experiments ) can operate below injection energies of 19.6 gev through a test run of au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 9.2 gev  @xcite .",
    "further , a set of observable for the physics goals were formulated  @xcite .",
    "this allowed for the starting of the first phase of the bes program in the year 2010 .",
    "the star experiment , with full azimuthal coverage , large and uniform acceptance for all midrapidity hadrons across all @xmath0 is ideally suited for this program .",
    "so far we have collected about 5 , 11 and 170 million good events for 7.7 , 11.5 and 39 gev au+au collisions respectively , in addition to taking data at higher energies of 62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "here we present results on ( a ) turn - off of observations related to partonic degrees of freedom , through the measurements of @xmath2 and dynamical charge correlations , ( b ) search for the signatures of softening of equation of state ( eos ) , through hbt and @xmath3 measurements and ( c ) search for signatures of cp through fluctuation measurements .",
    "the data presented are at midrapidity from the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) and time of flight ( tof ) detectors  @xcite .",
    "a high level trigger was used in the bes program to reject background events arising from beam and beam - pipe interactions  @xcite .",
    "the centrality selection was carried out using the uncorrected charge particle multiplicity measured in tpc for pseudorapidity , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the particle identification was done by measuring the specific ionization energy loss in tpc and the particle velocities using tof as a function of momentum . within the framework of a statistical model assuming theromodynamical equilibrium  @xcite the measured particle ratios ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in central ( 0 - 5% ) au+au collisions",
