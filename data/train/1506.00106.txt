    "the leading theories for the origin of long grb ( lgrb ) assume that the progenitors are massive stars , such as for example wolf - rayets ( wr ) and red giant , collapsing to a compact object ( black hole ( bh ) or neutron star ( ns ) ) @xcite .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are candidate progenitors for type ib / ic supernovae ( sne ) , which give birth to either a ns or a bh @xcite",
    ". they may be the progenitors of long and soft grbs , or at least part of them @xcite .",
    "the question is whether wrs collapse into a bh , or give birth to a type ib or type ic sn .",
    "this is relevant , because in this paper we aim to classify the grb observations according to their progenitor mass . in the scenario of possible grb progenitors , type ib , ic and ib / c supernovae ( sne ) or hypernovae",
    "are produced @xcite .",
    "it is realistic that core - collapse sne induce lgrb signals when stellar cores undergo fast rotations before the collapse .",
    "the bulk of matter then forms a torus around the newly - formed central compact object and , following the accretion of the torus , feeds the grb @xcite . as it is well known , the first non - electromagnetic signal that can be related by a grb is a gravitational radiation emission in the form of gws .",
    "such perturbations are not generated by the burst itself , but by the progenitor through the central engine @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of lgrbs , the gw signal should arrive soon before the burst , _",
    "i.e. _ during the core - collapse phase or during the production of the central bh which could be originated also by merging processes . for the sne - grb connection",
    ", several papers have been written ; a comprehensive discussion on the problem can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "considering progenitors , particularly in the case of lgrbs , there are no final models for the gws emission but several remarkable papers have been published pointing out the problem @xcite .",
    "the expected signal would lie in the range @xmath5 hz and , in principle , could be detected only for events up to a few tens of mpc @xcite .",
    "the limitation in distance is the main and critical problem for the detection of possible gw signals related to grb progenitors . in this paper",
    "we suppose that the progenitor masses , at the origin of lgrbs , could be related to the compact objects resulting as remnants of sne or collapsar processes .",
    "the resulting remnant can be either a ns or bh objects taking into account the emitted energies as gw in the grb prompt and in the afterglow phase .",
    "the gw production can give hints on the total mass of the collapsing system by estimating the global emitted gravitational energy . by relating the energy emitted in gw by the progenitor to a fraction @xmath4 of the electromagnetic grb prompt emission energy , and the energy emitted in gw by the remnant",
    ", one could trace the progenitor mass .",
    "the main steps that we will follow are :    * we assume that the energy released by the grb progenitor during the collapse is partially converted into gws , _",
    "i.e. _ we assume that the order of magnitude of gravitational energy is a certain fraction @xmath4 of the energy emitted in the electromagnetic @xmath0 ; * as a second step , we constrain the progenitor masses assuming that the energy balance of progenitor in the collapsar phase will be : @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the energy emitted by the progenitor as gw s , @xmath7 is the energy converted in gw during the grb prompt , and finally @xmath8 is the gw energy emitted by the remnant .",
    "we are aware that the energy emitted in gw by the remnant is not in principle directly related to the energy of the progenitor , but this is a rough estimate to correct the total gw emission of the grb . on the other hand",
    "it can be roughly justified by the consideration that some of the energy of the progenitor goes into the kinetic energy of the remnant , _",
    "e.g. _ in rotational energy , and thus in the latter gw emission .",
    "* we compare the dimensionless amplitude @xmath9 of gws , during the collapsar phase , with the current sensitivity curves of the ground interferometric gw antennas , like ligo and virgo , and the future interferometric gw antennas , like advanced ligo , advanced virgo and the forthcoming einstein underground interferometric gw antenna ( et ) ( see @xcite ) ; + in this context we choose progenitor masses in the interval @xmath10 , considering the more massive progenitors that can also be @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in this scenario , we take also into account the wolf - rayets with @xmath12 ( wo ) stars , that are produced in a limited mass range ( around @xmath11 ) and only at low metallicity ( @xmath13 ) . in the results presented in",
    "@xcite they end up with a ns or a bh as a remnant depending on the initial progenitor star mass , which is between @xmath14 in the first case , while in the latter @xmath15 .",
    "however , we here point out that , according to @xcite , a scenario of @xmath16 solar masses is preferred . moreover , among the progenitor types they select in the mass ranges between @xmath17 red super giant ( rsg ) , while for the other cases wc and wnl .",
    "@xcite present grids of stellar evolution models at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , for rotating magnetized stars in the initial mass range @xmath20 , and with initial equatorial rotation velocities between zero and @xmath21 of the keplerian value ( @xmath22 ) . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the mass range of grb production is @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , grb progenitors have a more massive helium envelope for slower semi - convection , on average . at @xmath26 , on the other hand , the rapidly rotating stars with @xmath27 form co cores of @xmath28 , which may be unstable due to the pair instability ( cf .",
    "the precise co core mass limit for the pair instability may increase with higher core angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we take these results as a reference for our study to achieve probable dimensionless gw amplitude and the gw emission frequency connected to the grb .",
    "in fact , the mass @xmath29 is near the transition from ns to bh formation @xcite , the exact boundary depending on rotation and mass loss @xcite , while we , conservatively , chose the star of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we discuss the possible gw emission associated to lgrbs .",
    "the goal is to show that the energy emitted in gw by the collapsing star can lead to the determination of the progenitor mass and to a suitable estimate of the fraction @xmath31 of the electromagnetic energy @xmath0 that is emitted in gws , and the energy emitted in gws by the remnant . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the algorithm we used , to obtain the progenitor and remnant parameters from the observed @xmath32 .",
    "we used the @xmath0 values observed by _ swift _",
    "@xcite , which span over a very wide redshifts range .",
    "results of calculations are reported in sec .",
    "4 while sec . 5",
    "is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in particular we discuss the initial conditions required to obtain collapsars and lgrb .",
    "the progenitors of lgrbs can be considered as the final step of a stellar collapse and their modeling is rather complicated since cumbersome three - dimensional simulations are required .",
    "many simulations have been performed for intermediate cases of core - collapse of snae , which should provide gw bursts @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a ns has long been considered an observable source of gws . during the core collapse",
    ", an initial signal is expected to be emitted due to the changing of mass distribution .",
    "a second part of the gw signal is produced when gravitational collapse is halted by the stiffening of the equation of state above nuclear densities and the core bounces , driving an outward moving shock , with the rapidly rotating proto - neutron star ( pns ) oscillating in its axisymmetric normal modes . in this paper",
    "we show that , at least for our grb sample , taking into account the grb distances ( @xmath33 , well beyond the horizon of gw antennas ) , with the advanced virgo and ligo we will not be able to see grbs within a certain ranges of frequencies and amplitudes , also according to the energy conversion factor from electromagnetic to gw that we estimate .    as a first step ,",
    "we start by evaluating the dimensionless gws amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "we remember that , in cases where the gws emission comes from a core - collapse process , we can not predict the exact shape of the emitted gws signal , but we can have an estimate starting from the energy flux .",
    "hereafter we will use the following notation : @xmath34    the energy flux of gws , defined as the power emitted per unit of surface at a large distance from the source is @xcite : @xmath35 where < ... > indicates a temporal average over a large enough number of periods . the total energy emitted assuming isotropic emission is then @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the distance to the source .",
    "we can write the power @xmath38 emitted in gw by the grb ( the gravitational luminosity ) , by inserting eq.([eq : hdieffe ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : egw ] ) to obtain : @xmath39 being @xmath40 if the frequency distribution of the grb is peaked around a frequency @xmath41 , as _",
    "e.g. _ in a sine - gaussian waveform , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pgw ] ) can be written as : @xmath42    considering that the only observable in the grb emission is the flux of electromagnetic energy @xmath0 ( in a certain band ) , we make the assumption that the energy emitted in gravitational waves is a fraction @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "so we have : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the time in which the @xmath45 of @xmath46 is emitted , and so : @xmath47    the fraction @xmath4 will also be a tunable parameter useful in order to compare the present and foreseen gw interferometric antenna sensitivities ( _ i.e. _ adv .",
    "virgo , adv .",
    "ligo and the forthcoming underground gw einstein telescope ) to the mean scaled gw amplitudes .",
    "let us consider a progenitor star of mass @xmath48 , radius @xmath49 and oblateness @xmath50 , rotating with a frequency @xmath51 , and a ns as a remnant after the process of grb emission with parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we have that @xcite : @xmath56 the momentum of inertia for a spherical rigid object ( considering negligible the quadrupolar oblateness @xmath57 ) is given by : @xmath58 the hypothesis of a rigid body also for the progenitors , can be accepted if one considers that magnetic fields can enhance their stiffness . taking into account the total energy balance of the process , we can roughly say that the energy emitted in gw by the grb is given by the difference of the energies emitted in grb by the progenitor and the remnant resulting in a similar relationship between the squares of gw amplitudes . from eqs .",
    "( [ hzeroene ] ) , ( [ hobal ] ) , ( [ hobal1 ] ) , ( [ i31 ] ) and ( [ iprg ] ) , we can very roughly write , in terms of the only observables , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath59 and t90 : @xmath60 so we get a function useful to solve our problem , that is @xmath61 to evaluate the physical parameters involved in the grb process to the remnant phase , we should estimate the @xmath62 parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) having only one observed data _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 .",
    "however the assumption we make for the progenitor models are very well posed in literature so that we can set very reasonable ranges for @xmath64 parameters out of @xmath65 , therefore the only key parameter we infer is the scale factor @xmath4 .    in the next section",
    "we will put the bases to solve this problem using a key idea and a suitable algorithm .",
    "our aim , as stated above , is to find the best progenitor mass starting from the observed @xmath0 . given eq .",
