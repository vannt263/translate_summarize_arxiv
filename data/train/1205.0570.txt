    "the notion of mesh patterns was introduced by brndn and claesson @xcite to provide explicit expansions for certain permutation statistics as , possibly infinite , linear combinations of ( classical ) permutation patterns ( see @xcite for a comprehensive introduction to the theory of permutation patterns ) .",
    "this notion was further studied in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a permutation in the symmetric group @xmath3 written in one - line notation .",
    "then we will consider the graph of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , to be the set of points @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the graph of the permutation @xmath8 is pictured in figure  [ fig : basic ] .",
    "then if we draw a coordinate system centered at a point @xmath6 , we will be interested in the points that lie in the four quadrants i , ii , iii , and iv of that coordinate system as pictured in figure [ fig : basic ] .",
    "for any @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of natural numbers and any @xmath11 , we say that @xmath12 matches the quadrant marked mesh pattern @xmath13 in @xmath4 if in @xmath5 relative to the coordinate system which has the point @xmath6 as its origin , there are @xmath14 points in quadrant i , @xmath15 points in quadrant ii , @xmath16 points in quadrant iii , and @xmath17 points in quadrant iv .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 , the point @xmath18 matches the quadrant marked mesh pattern @xmath19 since relative to the coordinate system with origin @xmath20 , there are 3 points in @xmath5 in quadrant i , 1 point in @xmath5 in quadrant ii , 2 points in @xmath5 in quadrant iii , and 2 points in @xmath5 in quadrant iv .",
    "note that if a coordinate in @xmath13 is 0 , then there is no condition imposed on the points in the corresponding quadrant .",
    "in addition , one can consider patterns @xmath13 where @xmath21 . here",
    "when one of the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 in @xmath13 is the empty set , then for @xmath12 to match @xmath13 in @xmath11 , it must be the case that there are no points in @xmath5 relative to coordinate system with origin @xmath6 in the corresponding quadrant .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 , the point @xmath26 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath27 since relative to the coordinate system with origin @xmath28 , there are 6 points in @xmath5 in quadrant i , 2 points in @xmath5 in quadrant ii , no points in @xmath5 in quadrant iii , and no points in @xmath5 in quadrant iv .",
    "we let @xmath29 denote the number of @xmath30 such that @xmath12 matches the marked mesh pattern @xmath13 in @xmath4 .",
    "note how the ( two - dimensional ) notation of lfarsson @xcite for marked mesh patterns corresponds to our ( one - line ) notation for quadrant marked mesh patterns .",
