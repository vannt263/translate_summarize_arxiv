    "in 1921 , with the article @xcite plya pioneered research on the simple random walk on the integer lattice . using fourier analysis he proved that @xmath1 , the @xmath3th step transition function , satisfies and @xmath4 we set @xmath5 @xmath6 for any @xmath7 .",
    "essentially , plya s proof shows that ( see spitzer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark after p7.9 ) ) @xmath8 uniformly with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "as it may be easily seen the local limit theorem is very inaccurate if @xmath10 is larger than @xmath11 .",
    "further development of the fourier method allowed to gain better control over the error term for large @xmath10 ( see smith @xcite , spitzer ( * ? ? ?",

    "namely , @xmath12 uniformly with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "let us observe that the error in the approximation of @xmath1 is additive and may become big compared to the first term .",

    "although , the asymptotic will be formulated for the simple random walk , the actual result is valid for any irreducible finite range random walk with the mean zero or not ( see theorem [ th:7 ] ) . before we state the main theorem ,",
    "let us introduce some notation .",

    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , observe that the asymptotic formula is valid in a region excluding only the case when @xmath29 stays bounded .",
    "although , the function @xmath30 is positive convex and comparable to @xmath31 , it can not be replaced in the asymptotic formula by @xmath31 without introducing an additional error term , see remark [ rem:1 ] . for processes with continuous time",
    "it was observed by davis in @xcite that in order to get an upper bound for the heat kernel on a larger region one has to introduce a non - gaussian factor .",
    "therefore , theorem [ th:3 ] may be considered as a discrete time counterpart of @xcite .",
    "finally , however the quadratic form @xmath32 is given explicitly by , the mapping @xmath33 is an implicit function .",
    "we want to stress the fact that when @xmath34 approaches one , the value of @xmath35 tends to infinity .",
    "in particular , the quadratic form @xmath36 degenerates . for this reason a more convenient form of theorem [ th:3 ]",
    "is given in corollary [ cor:1 ] .",

    "let us comment about the method of the proof .",
    "first , with a help of the fourier inversion formula , we write @xmath1 as an oscillatory integral .",
    "we split the integral into two parts .",
    "the first part we analyse by the laplace method .",
    "this is not a straightforward application of it , since the phase function degenerates as @xmath34 approaches one .",
    "to estimate the second part we develop a geometric argument , which allows us to control the way how the quadratic form @xmath36 degenerates .    the result obtained in this article",
    "has already found an application in the study of subordinated random walks ( see @xcite ) which are spread over all @xmath41 and do not have second moment .",
    "also the geometric method developed here can be successfully applied in much wider context .",
    "namely , to study finitely supported isotropic random walks on affine buildings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is also an ongoing project to get the precise asymptotic formula for random walks with internal degrees of freedom extending the one obtained by krmli and szsz @xcite ( see also guivarch @xcite ) .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec:1 ] contains application of theorem [ th:7 ] to triangular and hexagonal lattices .",
    "this has to be compared with results recently obtained in @xcite .",
