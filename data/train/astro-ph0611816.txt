    "one of the biggest surprises in modern cosmology was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating . taken together with other theoretical and observational evidence @xcite , this has been interpreted to imply that einstein s cosmological constant @xmath1 , or some other mechanism for acceleration , must feature prominently in cosmology .    with the universe spatially flat or very nearly so , the energy density @xmath2 associated with a cosmological constant ( or more generally , with dark energy ) is of order @xmath3 today .",
    "but in the cosmological constant scenario , @xmath2 is constant in time , which means that just after inflation , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , the energy density of radiation , differed by over 100 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this fine - tuning , and other conceptual problems with the cosmological constant , have been discussed extensively in the literature , for example in @xcite .",
    "a more general model for cosmic acceleration is a slowly - rolling scalar field , called quintessence ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the slow roll means that the field has negative pressure and therefore acts to accelerate expansion .",
    "quintessence can resolve the fine - tuning problem via tracker potentials , couplings between the quintessence field and dark matter , or modifications to general relativity .",
    "scalar fields , for example the dilaton field , arise necessarily in string theory and are generally coupled to matter .",
    "but if such a field couples strongly to matter , we should have detected it by now as a `` fifth force '' .",
    "a mechanism must therefore exist to suppress the detectable effect of any coupling to matter .",
    "khoury and weltman @xcite have suggested a coupling which gives the scalar field a mass depending on the local density of matter . in regions of high density ( like the earth ) ,",
    "the field has a large mass ; in regions of low density ( like interstellar space ) , the field has a small mass . in terrestrial experiments",
    ", the large mass of the field suppresses its interaction with matter . in observations of the solar system ,",
    "the action of the field is suppressed by a `` thin - shell mechanism '' , to be discussed .",
    "since the field is able to hide so well from our observations and experiments , it is called a chameleon .",
    "a specific example of a chameleon field arising from string theory is given in @xcite , which shows that under certain conditions , the radion field of brane theory can act as a chameleon .",
    "chameleon fields are not limited to quintessence .",
    "chameleon behaviour can be exhibited in , for example , @xmath5 theory , using the mechanism we describe below but with the sign of the coupling constants @xmath6 reversed @xcite .",
    "this article is intended to be a pedagogical introduction to chameleon gravity . for a complementary and more formal review , see mota and shaw @xcite .",
    "we will begin by introducing the action for gravity , matter , and the chameleon field @xmath0 , which we will use to determine the equation of motion for @xmath0 .",
    "we will find that we can write down an equation of motion for @xmath0 in terms of a bare quintessence - type potential @xmath7 and a contribution from the matter fields , which will give rise to a local relationship between the mass of the chameleon field and the density of matter .    with this in mind , we will then briefly detour into a discussion of the potential @xmath7 , finding that an exponential potential allows chameleon behaviour while causing cosmic acceleration , but that a power - law potential can not cause acceleration without violating , by several orders of magnitude , existing experimental bounds for laboratory detection .",
    "next , we will discuss the cosmological evolution of the chameleon field",
    ". the principal result of this section will be that @xmath0 keeps up with an attractor solution @xmath8 , analogous to tracker solutions in quintessence , from the very early universe until today .",
    "then we will derive the equation for the chameleon force acting on a test mass in a static chameleon field .",
    "a lengthy derivation will give us an approximate solution for static spherically symmetric chameleon fields which can be condensed into a useful maple script .",
    "the important result of this section will be a `` thin - shell suppression factor '' which explains why large objects like the earth do nt give rise to large chameleon forces .",
    "finally , we will use our solution to show explicitly both why the chameleon field may have eluded detection so far and why it may potentially be observed by satellite experiments .      in this essay",
    "we will set @xmath9 and @xmath10 and use the metric signature @xmath11 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath12 the reduced planck mass : @xmath13    since we are dealing with what is essentially a scalar - tensor theory of gravitation , we will be making use of the terms `` jordan frame '' and `` einstein frame '' .",
    "the einstein frame uses the bare spacetime metric @xmath14 , whereas the jordan frame uses a metric @xmath15 which is conformally related to @xmath14 ( the index @xmath16 may be used to enumerate matter species , allowing a different coupling for different species ) .",
    "the importance of the jordan frame is that in a scalar - tensor theory , @xmath15 is the metric which matter experiences . in",
    "what follows , we will make clear which frame goes with which equation .",
    "see the first three chapters of @xcite for an introduction to scalar - tensor theories and conformal transformations .    for simplicity of notation",
    ", we will often write @xmath17 in place of @xmath18 when we are working with a fixed index @xmath16 .",
    "recall the normalised vacuum einstein - hilbert action @xmath19 introduce a scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath20 and action @xmath21 so far , this is the standard picture .",
    "but now we introduce a set of matter fields @xmath22 with action @xmath23 which are coupled to @xmath0 by the definition @xmath24 where @xmath6 are dimensionless coupling constants , in principle one for each matter species .",
    "note that @xmath25 is a scalar density of weight 1 in the language of differential geometry .",
    "the total action including gravity , @xmath0 , and matter is thus as a rolling scalar field which happens to interact with matter , we could alternately have come up with @xmath26 as the action of a brans - dicke theory in which the scalar field happens to have a self - interaction potential @xmath27 . in the case",
    "that @xmath16 takes only one value , we could also have written @xmath26 in terms of the metric @xmath15 , making the role of @xmath0 as a fifth force clearer .",
    "see @xcite , for more on both these points . ]",
    "@xmath28 variation with respect to @xmath0 allows us to obtain the equation of motion for @xmath0 : @xmath29 the manipulations of the kinetic term in this derivation deserve careful explanation . on the first line we used the symmetry of the metric to get @xmath30 . on the second line we used the commutativity of differentiation with variation to get @xmath31 . on the third line we integrated by parts by applying the divergence theorem to @xmath32 , which is a vector density of weight 1 , and assuming that @xmath33 or @xmath34 at spacetime infinity or boundaries .",
    "requiring @xmath35 we thus have an equation of motion : @xmath36 but the sum on the right depends on both the matter content and @xmath0 .",
    "we would like to identify and isolate the matter content so that we can write an equation of motion with manifest @xmath0-dependence .      in this subsection , we will fix @xmath16 and write @xmath17 in place of @xmath18 .      assuming that the matter fields @xmath22 do not interact with each other @xcite , each energy - momentum tensor @xmath37 is conserved in the jordan frame @xcite .",
    "that is to say , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the metric connection corresponding to the metric @xmath40 .",
    "assume the matter to be a perfect isentropic fluid with @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 this is just the standard form , as in @xcite , written in the jordan frame .",
    "note that since matter of species @xmath16 couples universally to the metric @xmath40 , experiments composed of matter of species @xmath16 make measurements in terms of @xmath40 @xcite ; in particular , the energy density which we measure is @xmath43 .",
    "impose , without loss of generality , a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background metric .",
    "the energy density @xmath44 in the einstein frame ( the frame corresponding to @xmath14 ) is that quantity , conformally related to @xmath43 , which obeys the standard continuity equation @xmath45 .",
    "we will need the following : @xmath46    compute the christoffel symbols : @xmath47 then use them to expand the conservation equation ( [ conservationequation ] ) with index @xmath48 , remembering when we differentiate that we are holding @xmath0 fixed and simply varying the scale factor @xmath49 : @xmath50 thus , multiplying by @xmath51 : @xmath52 in other words , in the einstein frame , the quantity @xmath53 is the energy density of matter , because it obeys the continuity equation @xmath45 .",
    "( of course , if @xmath54 , then @xmath55 . )",
    "restoring the @xmath16 subscripts and using equation ( [ densityandpressure ] ) , we have the einstein - frame energy density for each species @xmath16 : @xmath56      substituting equation ( [ einstein_energydensity ] ) into equation ( [ firsteom ] ) , we obtain an equation of motion in which all the @xmath0 dependence is explicit : @xmath57    we may thus express the dynamics for @xmath0 in terms of a single effective potential , @xmath58 then the chameleon equation of motion in the einstein frame is simply @xmath59 recalling our choice of metric signature , this means that we expect @xmath0 to seek out minima of @xmath60 .",
    "note that in the case of non - relativistic matter , @xmath61 , so the effective potential simplifies to @xmath62 we will later be assuming @xmath63 , since we wish these coupling constants to take on `` natural '' values of order unity .",
    "if all @xmath6 are equal , then we may also assume we are working with a single matter species .",
    "we wish to choose a bare potential @xmath27 which can give rise to cosmic acceleration today via the slow - roll mechanism , as in quintessence @xcite .",
    "it would be cumbersome to come up with a mechanism that makes @xmath0 act as a cosmological constant only today , so we will assume that it has always been rolling down a potential slope in , without loss of generality , the positive direction . thus @xmath27 should be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath0 .    to obtain chameleon behaviour , we will see below that it is sufficient to assume that @xmath27 is of the `` runaway '' form , in the following sense :    1 .",
    "@xmath64 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath20 is @xmath65 , bounded below , and strictly deceasing ; 3 .",
    "@xmath66 is strictly negative and increasing ; 4 .",
    "@xmath67 is strictly positive and decreasing .",
    "we concomitantly confine @xmath0 to positive values .",
    "note that although runaway potentials are not found in classical physics , they do arise in supersymmetric models ; see @xcite for a discussion of such potentials in the context of quintessence .",
    "a convenient example which is often seen in quintessence models ( see @xcite , for example ) is the inverse power - law potential ( also called the ratra - peebles potential ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant with the dimension of mass and @xmath70 is a positive constant .",
    "another example is the exponential potential @xmath71 where again @xmath69 is a constant mass and @xmath70 is positive .",
    "the important difference between these potential functions is in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "the ratra - peebles potential goes to 0 , whereas the exponential potential goes to @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , present - day observations of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe give estimates of the value of the constant @xmath69 which differ by several orders of magnitude between the two potentials , as we will see later .",

    "it remains to discuss the initial conditions mentioned above .",
    "we now sketch this out , referring the reader to @xcite for the details .",
    "we assume that the universe undergoes an initial period of inflation driven by an inflaton field with @xmath174 which is coupled to @xmath0 in the same manner as matter",
    ". then equation ( [ veff ] ) gives @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the energy density of the inflaton field . since @xmath176 is roughly constant during inflation , the potential function @xmath172 is time - independent , so equation ( [ cosmiceom ] ) is the equation of a damped oscillator .    combining equations ( [ phimin ] ) and ( [ mmin ] ) and the friedmann equation , as we did in section [ cosmologicalevolution ] , ( or simply mapping @xmath177 and @xmath178 in equation ( [ mminoverhequality ] ) ) gives @xmath179 + 48\\beta^2\\omega_\\text{vac},\\ ] ] with @xmath180 since @xmath100 and @xmath181 are of order unity , we certainly have , for the discriminant of equation ( [ oscillatorapproximation ] ) , @xmath182 so that the oscillator is underdamped in the harmonic approximation .",
    "we therefore have that @xmath0 is driven exponentially towards @xmath8 during inflation : @xmath183 note that for the harmonic oscillator approximation to be valid , we must assume initial conditions such that @xmath184 initially .",
    "at the end of inflation , the inflaton decays into mostly radiation , plus some matter and small excitations of the field @xmath0 . because @xmath185 for radiation , it does not couple to @xmath0 and so @xmath8 increases dramatically during reheating .",
    "we still have @xmath186 , so @xmath0 is driven to and past @xmath8 .",
    "but as @xmath0 increases , @xmath187 decreases until friction takes over , at which point @xmath0 gets stuck at some elevated value .    as the universe expands and cools during the radiation era , matter species decouple from the heat bath one by one .",
    "when a species decouples , the perfect fluid approximation @xmath188 for matter becomes invalid for a time because the decoupling particles have relativistic velocities .",
    "this provides `` kicks '' to equation ( [ cosmiceom ] ) which drive @xmath0 back towards @xmath8 .",
    "when the radiation era ends and the matter era begins , the driving term in equation ( [ cosmiceom ] ) comes to dominate the friction term , so @xmath0 converges to @xmath8 and then follows it , as described in section [ cosmologicalevolution ] .",
    "the interaction of the chameleon field with matter is encapsulated by the conformal coupling of equation ( [ conformalrelation ] ) ; so is the interaction of the spacetime geometry with matter . since matter fields @xmath22 couple to @xmath15 instead of to @xmath14 , the worldlines of free test particles ( meaning particles experiencing only gravity and the chameleon force ) of species @xmath16 are the geodesics of @xmath15 rather than those of @xmath14 ( see also @xcite ) .. ]    the geodesic equation for the worldline @xmath189 of a test mass of species @xmath16 is @xmath190 where @xmath191 are the christoffel symbols and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to proper time @xmath192 , both in the @xmath40 metric .",
    "using @xmath193 the christoffel symbols can be determined as follows : @xmath194    substituting this into ( [ geodesic ] ) gives @xmath195 the second term in the above equation is the familiar gravitational term , while the term in @xmath196 is the chameleon force .",
    "we see that in the non - relativistic limit , a test mass @xmath187 of species @xmath16 in a static chameleon field @xmath0 experiences a force @xmath197 given by @xmath198 as in @xcite .",

    "we could change the solution regions so that @xmath304 .",
    "that is , we would use the harmonic approximation inside the sphere , the linear approximation on the interval @xmath305 , and the harmonic approximation again on the interval @xmath306 .",
    "however , a vacuum - chamber model has already been provided in @xcite , which shows that if the radius of the vacuum chamber is @xmath307 , then the mass of the chameleon field inside the chamber is @xmath308 .",
    "this will allow us in section [ copperballexperiment ] to use our existing solution algorithm with @xmath206 tuned so that @xmath309 .    the second generalization is to the case of more than two density regions , for example in modelling the earth with its atmosphere .",
    "we can adapt our solution to this case by writing the density regions as a sequence of intervals @xmath310 and solving a system of equations for @xmath311 and for the continuity conditions at all the interval boundaries .",
    "however , if all adjacent pairs of intermediate density regions satisfy the thin - shell condition , the solution for the whole system is simply the piecewise connection of the sequence of two - region solutions .",
    "reference @xcite provides a discussion of several experimental models which demonstrates why the chameleon , if it exists , is capable of evading experimental detection to date",

    "now consider a copper ball of radius @xmath316 and density @xmath317 , such as those used in small - scale gravity experiments like @xcite .        in the atmosphere , with density @xmath318 , our algorithm gives a low - contrast solution ( figure [ cuballatmos ] ) with @xmath319        in space , with density @xmath320 , our algorithm gives a thick - shell solution ( figure [ cuballspace ] ) with @xmath321        finally , we consider the chameleon profile for such a ball inside a vacuum chamber of radius @xmath307 , as in @xcite . as shown in @xcite , the chameleon field has a mass @xmath322 inside the chamber . using equations ( [ phimin ] ) and ( [ mmin ] )",

    "thus , the chameleon field can be hidden from their experiment .        however",
    ", if the experiment were repeated in orbit with @xmath301 , the chameleon field of the copper ball would introduce a correction of order unity to its gravitational field : the newtonian gravitational acceleration of a test mass @xmath331 from the centre of the copper ball is @xmath332 and the chameleon acceleration of such a test mass is @xmath333 .",
    "see figure [ cuballspacewithgravity ] for a comparison of these forces at short range .",
    "the see project @xcite proposed to test gravity in space , including searching for a fifth force between two test bodies .",
    "supposing that the see satellite is a sphere of radius @xmath334 and density @xmath335 , it satisfies the thick - shell condition for its chameleon field .",
    "thus , @xmath336 inside the satellite , , @xmath105 will itself be damped by the presence of the earth , but the qualitative behaviour of @xmath244 near the test mass will be unaffected .",
    "] so an experiment taking place within the satellite is effectively taking place in space . as we saw above , test masses in space should exhibit a mutual attraction due to the chameleon force of the same order as their gravitational attraction , assuming @xmath337 .",
    "the see project , or another space experiment like it , such as apsis @xcite , would thus provide a test for the existence of a chameleon field .",
    "the satellite experiments step , gg , and microscope plan to test the etvs parameter @xmath338 to very high accuracy .",
    "this provides a bound on violations of the equivalence principle by quantifying the variation in free - fall acceleration between bodies of differing composition @xcite .",
    "if the chameleon coupling factor @xmath100 is different for different compositions of matter , these differences will manifest themselves in equivalence principle violations which may be detectable by these experiments .",
    "we have given a pedagogical overview of the chameleon field .",
    "we derived its equation of motion from an action and discussed the definition of the matter density and the choice of the potential @xmath7 , showing that a chameleon field with an exponential potential function can account for cosmic acceleration today while remaining hidden from experiments .",
    "then we discussed the cosmological history of the chameleon field , and finally its interaction with matter today . with the help of a maple script",
    ", we quickly classified several examples of the chameleon field due to spherical matter distributions and used them to explain not just why the chameleon field has remained hidden from experiments so far but also why it has the potential to be detected .",
    "there are several topics which we did not treat in much detail : string - theoretical motivations for chameleon fields ; the chameleon s transition from the inflation era to the radiation era ; equivalence principle violations ; and exact constraints on the chameleon model from current experimental data .",
    "many of these subjects are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .    see or apsis will provide strong evidence either for or against the presence of a chameleon field .",
    "if it does exist , many questions will remain : what is the potential function @xmath7 ?",
    "how does the chameleon field behave in the presence of strong gravitational fields ?    the chameleon field is an intriguing model because of its promise of explaining cosmic acceleration and because of the possibility that it may soon be tested by satellite experiments .",
    "even if it is not detected , it may stimulate other ideas for testable alternate theories of gravity , which is an important part of the investigation into the nature of dark energy .",
    "the chameleon field has the unusual physical property of density dependence .",
    "matter density appears in the perfect fluid approximation of other theories , such as newtonian gravity and bare general relativity , but these theories may be rewritten in terms of enclosed mass or the mass of point particles . in chameleon gravity , however , there is no obvious way to escape the perfect fluid approximation .",
    "this must be regarded as a shortcoming of the model described here , since in the real universe the notion of local matter density @xmath44 is not well - defined .",
    "it is essential that the point - particle regime of the chameleon model be explored to see if it is consistent with the perfect fluid approximation .",
    "even if we accept the perfect fluid approximation , we must remember that the real universe is inhomogeneous on scales ranging from the sub - atomic all the way up to the cosmological .",
    "given the non - linear density dependence of the chameleon interaction , we must exercise caution in using the chameleon model to make predictions for real experiments . a more general solution method or a successful numerical approach to solving the chameleon",
    "differential equation would allow us to explore the chameleon on a variety of scales and to make predictions in realistic scenarios rather than just toy models .",
    "in discussing the choice of the potential @xmath27 , we determined that a chameleon field with the power - law potential is ruled out by existing experiments .",
    "but the exponential potential we settled on has the same fine - tuning problem as a bare cosmological constant @xmath1 , and so it introduces more problems than it solves",
    ". a useful chameleon theory should give @xmath339 today without resorting to fine - tuning .    the conformal coupling ( [ conformalrelation ] ) which we used is not the only possible choice .",
    "different coupling functions give rise to different chameleon field theories , in which the thin - shell condition may be easier , harder , or impossible , to satisfy @xcite . in any case",
    ", the behaviour of the chameleon force depends strongly on the choice of coupling function , and we have explored only one specific example here .",
    "a different choice may alleviate the problems mentioned above with the potential @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to proposed satellite experiments , chameleon - type modified gravity may have astrophysical effects , for example in the gravitational collapse of gas clouds or in the dynamics of planetary ring systems .",
    "again , this demands a more general solution method than the approximation we derived in this work .    the recent review by mota and shaw @xcite , while not completely answering the above questions , points the way forward , exploring a more general class of potentials than we have done here and also constructing an `` effective macroscopic theory '' of the chameleon field for composite bodies made of small finite - size particles .",

    "<S> that is , matter experiences a metric which is a conformal transform ( parametrized by @xmath0 ) of the einstein metric . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential of the field @xmath0 is a sum of its self - interaction term and an exponential term due to the conformal coupling . under certain conditions on the self - interaction and the coupling , </S>",
    "<S> this effective potential has a minimum which depends on the local matter density , as does its second derivative at the minimum . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the scalar field acquires a mass which increases with local matter density .    the field @xmath0 mediates a fifth force which is suppressed in the laboratory and in interactions between large bodies like planets , but which may be detectable between small test masses in space .    </S>",
    "<S> in this pedagogical essay , we derive the equation of motion of @xmath0 , discuss chameleon - field cosmology , and examine some simple solutions with a view to experimental detection of the chameleon . </S>"
