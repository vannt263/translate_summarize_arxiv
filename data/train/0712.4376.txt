    "theoretical studies of baryon - antibaryon bound states date back to the proposal of fermi and yang @xcite to make the pion with a nucleon - antinucleon pair .",
    "the traditional @xmath5 interaction studies , such as boundary condition model @xcite , optical model @xcite and coupled - channel models @xcite , emphasized on the handling of the short - range part of @xmath5 interaction , and for the long range part they are quite similar .",
    "the extensive and excellent reviews are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the agreement with scattering experimental data is obtained , from the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) point of view it is hard to image that a hadronic picture can be applied to such a short - range where hadrons are  overlapped \" and the internal structure of hadrons must be considered .    a possible way out is to start from qcd , the fundamental strong interaction theory .",
    "namely we should start with quark - gluon degree of freedom , rather than the meson - baryon picture .",
    "qcd has been already proved to be the right theory at high energy . at low energy , because of the non - perturbative nature of qcd , one has to rely on effective theories and/or qcd - inspired models to get some insight into the phenomena of the hadronic world .",
    "the constituent quark model @xcite is one of them .",
    "it has been successful in describing hadron spectrum , the baryon - baryon interactions and the bound state of two baryons , the deuteron .",
    "therefore , extending the constituent quark model to @xmath5 study is an interesting practice .",
    "the early studies in the traditional meson exchange framework found that , if neglecting annihilation channels , many bound states might be formed , while annihilation effects were included , the binding force decreased and some bound states were washed out@xcite . therefore , how to take into account the effect of annihilation in an unified framework is important .",
    "we attempt to include the contributions of the annihilations of a @xmath6 pair into meson or into gluon in an unified manner , besides including @xmath0 , @xmath7 and gluon exchange in the constituent quark model . in order to keep the model well - describing baryon spectrum and @xmath8 scattering data ,",
    "all of the model parameters have been fixed as much possible as those fixed in @xmath8 interaction and baryon spectrum .",
    "perturbative qcd calculation showed that the gluon running coupling constant decreasing with the increasing of momentum transfer . here",
    "we vary gluon annihilation coupling constant @xmath9 to see if the proton - antiproton @xmath1-wave elastic cross section experimental data@xcite can be well reproduced . for comparison ,",
    "the case of ignoring the contributions of @xmath0 annihilation is also computed .",
    "the bes collaboration in the radiative decay @xmath10 observed a sharp enhancement at threshold in the @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "they tried to fit the enhancement by means of a @xmath1-wave breit - wigner resonance , and obtained the resultant mass peak below threshold .",
    "belle also reported they observed an enhancement in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution near the threshold in the decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "many interpretations @xcite on the observation were suggested .",
    "here we apply the constituent quark model constrained by baryon spectrum and @xmath8 interaction and in addition considering the contribution of annihilation fixed by proton - antiproton @xmath1-wave elastic scattering cross section , to do a dynamical calculation for all possible @xmath1-wave nucleon - antinucleon system to study if there is @xmath2 @xmath1-wave bound state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii explains the model hamiltonian , its parameters and the calculation method .",
    "iii is the results and discussions .",
    "we take the chiral quark model used in the study of multi - quark system , which essentially is an effective theory on exchanges of goldstone boson , scalar meson @xmath7 , as well as gluon between quarks , and extend it to include the antiquarks and the annihilation interaction , to study the nucleon - antinucleon system .    as the first step , here",
    "only @xmath1-wave states of the nucleon - antinucleon pair are considered , i.e. , the total orbital angular momentum @xmath13 , and we have @xmath14 ( the total angular momentum comes from quark spin only ) .",
    "we start from a hamiltonian which was used by salamanca group for nn interaction@xcite .",
    "it is one of the chiral quark model with only @xmath0 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the quark - meson coupling constant @xmath15 is fixed by @xmath16 @xmath17 the quark mass @xmath18 and @xmath7 meson mass @xmath19 are taken to be 313 mev and 3.421 @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "quark - gluon coupling constant @xmath21 is determined by the @xmath22 mass difference .",
