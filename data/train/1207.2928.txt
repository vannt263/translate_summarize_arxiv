    "self - regulation plays an important role in biological and technical systems .",

    "further examples are the concentration of ions , proteins and transmitters in the brain , their respective levels are all self regulated @xcite . furthermore , homeostasis is implemented and can be found in technical systems , for example in microrobotic swarms @xcite .",
    "adaption typically introduces a slow time scale into the dynamical system @xcite , a process also denoted meta learning , a central notion in the context of neuromodulation @xcite and emotional control @xcite .",
    "the resulting dynamical system then has both fast and slow variables and critical transitions in the form of tipping processes may occur @xcite .",
    "classical homeostasis involves the regulation of a scalar quantity , like the body temperature .",
    "more complex forms of homeostasis are however also important in the realm of life . for example , an animal may want to achieve a certain time averaged distribution of behaviors , like foraging , resting and engaging socially , over the course of several days .",
    "this kind of adaptive behavior has been termed polyhomeostasis @xcite .",
    "it occurs when a dynamical system tries to achieve , via the continuous adaption of slow variables , a given target distribution for the time - averaged activity of a subset of fast variables .",

    "tipping transitions can occur both in adaptive and in driven systems .",
    "potential tipping scenarios are currently discussed intensively in the context of climate research @xcite , they may be related to a slow driving of external parameters @xcite , to noisy input inducing a stochastic escape from a local attractor @xcite , or through a dynamical effect when the rate of change of a control parameter reaches a certain threshold @xcite .    here",
    "we study the phenomenon of self - organized tipping for a polyhomeostatic adapting system driven by a steady - state stochastic input .",
    "we examine a previously proposed model @xcite for regulating the firing rate distribution of individual neurons based on information - theoretical principles .",
    "this type of model has been studied previously for the case of discrete time systems and unimodal target firing rate distributions @xcite . here",
    "we examine the case of continuous time and bimodal target distribution functions , corresponding to sparse coding .",
    "for bimodal firing rate distributions the neural activity tends to switch in between states close to minimal and maximal activity .",
    "similar bimodal activity states are observed also in many other systems , e.g.  dynamical gene regulation networks @xcite .",
