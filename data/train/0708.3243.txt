    "observations of nearby galaxies suggest that there exists a gas surface density threshold for star formation in a galactic disk @xcite .",
    "this threshold is hypothesized to be formed by the threshold for gravitational stability of the disk , although alternative explanations have been offered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gravitationally unstable regions are commonly identified by the toomre criterion @xcite , which considers the stability of a single - component disk against axisymmetric perturbations . however ,",
    "this criterion , when applied to observed gas surface densities , does not always correctly predict the locations of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar contribution to the gravitational instability could be important ; for example , the giant molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have been shown to correlate with stellar surface density , indicating the increase of star formation towards regions of higher stellar gravity @xcite .    to crudely include the stellar contribution , @xcite derived the stability criterion for a two - fluid disk .",
    "this stability criterion differs from the toomre criterion by only a linear correction factor , when the gas - to - stellar ratios of surface density and velocity dispersion are constant across a galaxy , or when the gas and stellar components are only weakly coupled @xcite . to correctly include the stellar contribution",
    ", @xcite and @xcite analyzed the stability of a composite disk consisting of a collisional gas component and a population of collisionless stellar components .",
    "the resulting instability criterion has been used to explain the dust morphology of edge - on disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "we study the relationship between gravitational stability and star formation in the lmc .",

    "* ) , its internal and foreground extinctions are small , and its moderate inclination allows spatial and kinematical mapping of the disk with minimum confusion along the line of sight . both stars and the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the lmc",
    "have been extensively surveyed .",

    "observations have been used to identify massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) , which mark the sites of current star formation ( r.  a. gruendl et al .",
    ", in preparation ; b.  a. whitney et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "massive ysos provide better probes than regions to study the relationship between the ism and star formation because their stellar energy feedback has not significantly altered the distributions and physical conditions of the ambient ism .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relationship between global star formation and gravitational instability in the lmc using two different stability analyses : assuming that the gaseous disk is decoupled from the stellar disk and considering only the gravity of the gas (   [ s : q_g ] ) , or assuming a collisionless stellar disk and a collisional gas disk and using the @xcite stability criterion (   [ s : qsg ] ) .",
    "the results are discussed in   [ s : disc ] .",
    "a thin , differentially rotating gaseous disk is unstable against axisymmetric perturbations when @xmath1 where @xmath2 is generally referred to as the toomre @xmath3 parameter for a gaseous disk , @xmath4 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath5 is the isothermal sound speed of the gas , @xmath6 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath7 is the unperturbed surface density of the gas @xcite . to apply this analysis to a disk galaxy , approximations need to be made",
    "first , rather than consisting of a single isothermal component , the real ism consists of gas with temperatures ranging from 10  k to @xmath8  k in multiple phases including cold atomic and molecular , warm atomic and ionized , and hot ionized gas .",
    "however , the gas mass is dominated by cold atomic and molecular material in turbulent motion , except possibly in star - forming regions where much of the ism is ionized .",
    "therefore , we consider only the neutral atomic and molecular gas mass .",
    "the atomic medium of galaxies generally has nearly constant velocity dispersion @xcite , and has a vertical thickness that is well modeled by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential at the velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the gas disk of the lmc has an effective sound speed representative of the velocity dispersion @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath7 in equation  ( [ e : q_g ] ) is the _ unperturbed _ gas surface density , while the observed gas surface density is _",
    "perturbed_. the surface density of a gravitationally unstable region grows exponentially as it collapses ; thus , using the observed surface density in equation  ( [ e : q_g ] ) will correctly diagnose gravitationally unstable regions , but @xmath2 may be underestimated if collapse has set in .",
    "therefore , we adopt the observed gas surface density for @xmath7 in equation  ( [ e : q_g ] ) to identify gravitationally unstable regions",
    ".    the neutral atomic and molecular components of the ism in the lmc have been well surveyed . for the neutral atomic component ,",
    "we use the column density map derived from the combined data set of the australia telescope compact array and the parkes multibeam receiver @xcite .",
    "this map has a resolution of @xmath111 , or 15  pc . for the molecular component",
    ", we use the nanten co survey of the lmc conducted by @xcite .",
    "these maps have a resolution of @xmath1126 , or 40  pc .",
    "we scale maps of integrated column density by the co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor , @xmath13  h@xmath12 atoms @xmath14 ( k km s@xmath10)@xmath10 @xcite to obtain the h@xmath12 mass distribution .",
    "both the and h@xmath12 maps are clipped at the 1@xmath15 level to prevent negative densities and minimize the effects of noise .",
    "furthermore , we account for he and heavier elements by assuming that the mass fraction of h is @xmath16 . from the map",
    ", we find a total mass for the neutral atomic component of @xmath17 , consistent with the value found by @xcite .",
    "for the molecular component , we find a total mass of @xmath18 , which is on the high side of the 47@xmath19 given by @xcite , as we used a higher co - to - h@xmath12 conversion factor and included he and heavy elements .",
    "we add these two maps to obtain a map of total gas surface density with a resolution of 40  pc pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the resulting map is shown in figure  [ fi : maps]a .",
    "the remaining parameter needed in equation  ( [ e : q_g ] ) is the epicyclic frequency @xmath4 , defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the galactocentric distance and @xmath22 is the circular velocity as a function of @xmath21 . to calculate @xmath4 at a given @xmath21 in the lmc",
    ", we use the rotation curve derived by @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve is a best - fit to the and the carbon star @xcite measurements inside and outside of about 3.2  kpc , respectively .",
    "we find the derivatives of the circular velocity and thus the epicyclic frequency by central finite differences with an increment of 250  pc , then we use a cubic spline to interpolate the discrete results to a continuous domain .",
    "finally , the center and the orientation of the disk of the lmc need to be specified . to be consistent with the kinematics",
    ", we adopt the same center and orientation determined by @xcite .",
    "the kinematic center of the lmc disk is at @xmath23176 and @xmath2402  ( j2000 ) with an inclination of @xmath25 and a line of nodes at a p.a . of @xmath26 . using this geometry ,",
    "the total gas surface density map is deprojected to determine the galactocentric distance of each pixel , allowing us to construct a map of @xmath2 calculated from equation  ( [ e : q_g ] ) .",
    "this map is shown in figure  [ fi : maps]b .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fi : maps]b delineate the critical boundary @xmath27 that surrounds regions gravitationally unstable due to gas alone . also marked in the figure are candidate massive ysos from r.  a. gruendl et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , indicating regions of on - going star formation . in the top panel of figure  [ fi : hist ] , we show the number distribution of yso candidates and the corresponding cumulative fraction with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "while @xmath1162% ( 153 of 245 ) of the yso candidates do lie in regions with @xmath28 , the rest are distributed in regions with values as high as @xmath29 .    some of the candidates with @xmath28 might be argued not to result from large - scale gravitational instabilities because the unstable regions in which they reside are too small .",
    "if we exclude regions @xmath30  pc in diameter , only 47% ( 116 ) of the yso candidates would be associated with gravitationally unstable regions by this criterion . a frequently used empirical correction for the contributions from the stellar component @xcite and",
    "the effect of the disk scale height @xcite is to raise the critical value to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "even if we apply this linear correction factor to the toomre criterion , @xmath1125  % of the yso candidates still appear to reside in stable regions . considering the stability of only the gas disk or applying a simple linear correction to the toomre criterion may not be sufficient to account for star formation activity .",
    "we now also consider the contribution of stars to gravitational instability . to include them",
    ", we follow rafikov s ( 2001 ) treatment of a disk galaxy consisting of a collisional gas disk and a collisionless stellar disk .",

    ", we use the number density of red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , as they are part of the old stellar population and therefore trace the overall mass distribution of the stellar disk . rgb and",
    "agb stars are luminous and distinctive in the @xmath41 $ ] vs.  @xmath42 color - magnitude diagram and much less confused by faint background galaxies or galactic stars . to select these stars , we follow a procedure similar to that outlined by @xcite but use only the two micron all sky survey point source catalogue @xcite and the criteria : @xmath41 < ( 22 - [ k_s ] ) / 10.5 $ ] and @xmath43 < 14.5 $ ] .",
    "the source counts are then binned with a resolution of 40  pc pixel@xmath10 and gaussian smoothed with a dispersion of 100  pc .",
    "the smoothing scale is chosen to minimize pixel - to - pixel variations due to the small number density of the tracer rgb and agb stars , while retaining good spatial resolution for the analysis ; this scale is also small compared to the large - scale gravitational instability in the analysis . in the resulting map ,",
    "a faint galactic background with a gradient is present .",
    "therefore , we fit and subtract this background with exponential and linear dependencies on the galactic latitude and longitude , respectively . finally , by adopting the total stellar mass of @xmath44 estimated by @xcite , we normalize this map to obtain the absolute stellar surface density map shown in figure  [ fi : maps]c ( cf . fig .  2 of * ?",
    "we adopt a constant stellar radial velocity dispersion of 15  km  s@xmath10 , after considering the velocity dispersions of carbon stars @xcite , red supergiants @xcite , and young globular clusters @xcite .    with these values",
    "assessed , the parameter @xmath40 defined in equation  ( [ e : qsg ] ) now depends only on the perturbation wavenumber @xmath38 , or equivalently , the perturbation wavelength @xmath45 at each pixel ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : qsgwl ] ) .",
    "since @xmath40 decreases with the degree of gravitational instability and our objective is to locate gravitationally unstable regions , we define its value at each pixel as its global minimum with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "the derived @xmath40 map of the lmc is shown in figure  [ fi : maps]d , with the identified ysos overlaid .",
    "each point is unstable to perturbations over a finite range of wavelengths , as shown by figure  [ fi : qsgwl ] .",
    "if the size of a gravitationally unstable region is smaller than the minimum unstable wavelength @xmath47 , no perturbation inside the region can have long enough wavelength to drive an instability .",
    "therefore , we also find @xmath47 in each pixel , and compare this value with the size of each region containing yso candidates by visual inspection .",
    "the contours of @xmath48 are plotted over grayscale presentations of @xmath47 in figure  [ fi : lmin ] so that the sizes of the @xmath49 regions can be compared with the minimum unstable wavelengths directly .",
    "figure  [ fi : maps]d shows that , because of the stellar contribution , a much larger fraction of the galaxy is unstable than would have been deduced just from the gas contribution shown in figure  [ fi : maps]b .",
    "the vast majority of the massive yso candidates are in fact located within gravitationally unstable regions , in sharp contrast to the results in   [ s : q_g ] where only the gas is considered . particularly noticeable",
    "is the vicinity of the lmc bar region , where on - going star formation is observed .",
    "this bar region , having low gas surface densities and high epicyclic frequencies , is stable when only the gas disk is considered , but becomes unstable when the stellar component is added .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fi : hist ] shows the number distribution of yso candidates and the corresponding cumulative fraction with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "about 86% ( 212 of 245 ) of the yso candidates are located in regions where @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fi : lmin ] shows 12 of the 212 ysos in probably stable regions having @xmath49 but region size @xmath50 . removing these",
    "12 still leaves 82% of the ysos whose formation is attributed to gravitational instability of the disk of stars and gas .",
    "one caution is that finite thickness of the disk may lower the critical @xmath40 value slightly , depending on the scale height of the disk relative to the unstable wavelengths @xcite . given an estimated scale height of @xmath11180  pc @xcite and kiloparsec - scale unstable wavelengths in the lmc , this effect may be small .",
    "the results demonstrate that the stellar contribution to gravitational instability can be significant .",
    "gravitational instability of the full disk appears responsible for most large - scale star formation activity .",
    "@xcite has argued that a constant gas surface density threshold is a good indicator in predicting the edge of the star forming disk .",
    "he suggested that , for the lmc disk , this threshold is @xmath114  @xmath51 pc@xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fi : maps]a shows the contours of 4  @xmath51 pc@xmath52 in total neutral gas surface density .",
    "the contours encompass the majority of the lmc disk except the central cavities of the supergiant shells lmc-4 and lmc-8 @xcite .",
    "clearly , all the massive yso candidates are located where the gas surface density is greater than 4  @xmath51 pc@xmath52 , but this constant surface density threshold does not account for the distribution of the star forming sites , especially in the inner parts of the lmc disk .",
    "therefore , schaye s ( 2004 ) constant surface density threshold is a necessary but not sufficient condition for star formation .",
    "detailed analysis of the large - scale gravitational instability , as shown in ",
    "[ s : gi ] , is still needed .",
    "another measure of the response of star formation to disk instability is the relation between @xmath40 and the effective timescale for star formation @xmath53 .",
    "this can be approximated if we assume the average lifetime of massive ysos is constant .",
    "we normalize the number of ysos , @xmath54 , within a region having a given range of @xmath40 by the area , as represented by the total number of pixels @xmath55 within that region .",
    "figure  [ fi : rate ] presents @xmath56 , which is @xmath57 , for a number of @xmath40 bins .",
    "the errors in the ratio are estimated assuming poisson statistics on the number of ysos and number of pixels , while the horizontal error bars show the size of the bins .",
    "a clear log - linear relationship is found , implying that the response of star formation depends exponentially on the value of @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite also found an exponential dependence @xmath58 , with @xmath59 from global numerical simulations of galactic disks .",
    "a linear fit to the data in figure  [ fi : rate ] gives a slope that can be interpreted as a local value of @xmath60 .",
    "this behavior appears to be a general property of nonlinear gravitational instability .",
    "we have made the simple assumption that the structure of the lmc is a thin , flat disk with negligible stellar halo . in reality",
    ", tidal features due to galaxy - galaxy interactions do exist in the outer parts of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , at some locations , there exist multiple velocity components , which we have simply summed to obtain total gas surface density .",
    "other uncertainties stem from our assumed constant gas effective sound speed ( or velocity dispersion ) and stellar radial velocity dispersion .",
    "these affect the relative contribution of each component to the gravitational instability : the higher the local velocity dispersion , the less contribution a component has .",
    "the sound speed of the gas we adopt , 5  km s@xmath10 , is a typical average for the neutral gas .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion of stars is also uncertain . as gravitational instability",
    "is much more sensitive to the gas component due to its low sound speed , it is less affected by the uncertainty in the stellar velocity dispersion . yet",
    "another effect to consider is the scale height of the disk , which tends to stabilize the disk @xcite .",
    "given all these uncertainties , nevertheless , the exponential dependence of star formation rate on @xmath40 that we find appears to be robust .    from our analysis of the gravitational instability of the lmc , we conclude that the contribution of the stellar disk to gravitational instability can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "taking it into account in the case of the lmc , we find that @xmath1185% of the massive yso candidates lie in gravitationally unstable regions , implying that star formation occurs predominantly in these regions .",
    "it appears that gravitational instability of the disk drives most large - scale star formation , as proposed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
