    "many observables in nuclear collisions are difficult to calculate analytically because the number of particles is neither large enough to justify rigorously the application of statistical mechanics nor small enough to justify impulse approximations . in most cases , numerical simulations of transport equations",

    "another test of the frame and scattering scheme dependence of cascade models was proposed in @xcite . in this paper , we propose two further tests for the oscar standard : the equation of state and the collision rate test of one - component relativistic classical gases .",
    "the tests provide information about the nature of the code s initial momentum distribution and check its evolution algorithm in free expansion in periodic spatial inhomogeneities against nontrivial analytic expressions . the transverse to parallel momentum flux ratio tests the evolution of space - time and momentum space correlations .",
    "the asymptotic homogeneous equilibrated state tests the equation of state of the model against the expected ideal gas laws .",
    "the collision frequency test checks the basic collision algorithm .",
    "we apply these tests to the newly developed zpc parton cascade model @xcite . in order to pass these tests",

    "we discuss that example in detail to illustrate the importance of applying such numerical tests .",
    "we propose to add these tests to the group already in the oscar standard@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , we recall basic statistical mechanics relations of ideal gas and calculate the free streaming evolution of periodic slab initial spatial distribution .",
    "in addition the collision rate is discussed .",

    "@xcite for details ) .",

    "more collisions are neglected and the collision rate is lower than expected .    in the dilute limit ,",
    "the percentage of non - causal collisions out of total number of collisions for massless particles is proportional to the number of particles inside the causal sphere in the two colliding particle center of mass frame .",

    ", @xmath78 is screening mass .",
    "@xmath102 gives the ratio of interaction length to the estimate of mean free path before rescaling .",
    "@xmath94 is the scaling parameter , i.e. , the total number of particles is increased by a factor of @xmath94 and the cross section is decreased by a factor of @xmath94 ( but the number of collisions is still for @xmath99 particles ) .",
    "@xmath103 is the ratio of interaction length to the estimate of mean free path including the rescaling , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 is the ratio of interaction length to the measured mean free path .",
    "the mean free path is measured through the formula , @xmath106 , in which @xmath54 is the collision rate per unit volume and the particles are moving at the speed of light .",
    "the ratio of the number of non - causal collisions to the total number of collisions is also plotted in fig .  8 against the ratio of interaction length to the mean free path . in fig .  8 , the open circles are data against @xmath103 and the filled circles are against @xmath105",
    "it shows that when the density increases , i.e. , when @xmath92 increases , the difference between @xmath105 and @xmath103 increases .",
    "this tells us that when density is high , the naive formula for the estimate of mean free path , @xmath107 , needs to be corrected .",
    "also we see the data deviate from linear formula and has a tendency of saturation when density is large .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the ratio should always be less than @xmath108 from the definition of the non - causal collision .    when we fix @xmath78 and increase @xmath94 from @xmath109 to @xmath72 , the total number of collisions goes up from @xmath110 for @xmath111 to @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath114 , the total number of collisions is @xmath115 .",
    "we see clearly the trend toward a constant value of total number of collisions when @xmath94 is increased .",
    "the collision rate with @xmath114 is shown in fig .",
    "6 as an open triangle ( the @xmath111 data is shown as an open circle ) .",
    "the collision rate with @xmath114 is within @xmath116 of the analytic prediction .    during the preliminary study of the collision rate",
    ", we found when @xmath117 , the collision rate is higher than the predicted rate . by looking more carefully into the code , we found out that it was caused by the larger than statistical fluctuations in the position distribution . when the fugacity @xmath75 is not uniform in space , the collision rate per unit volume",
    ": @xmath118 in which : @xmath119 by using the inequality , @xmath120 and the fact that the system we prepared has zero chemical potential and hence averaged fugacity is one , we arrive at : @xmath121 the equality holds only when the fugacity has no spatial dependence .",
    "this shows that when there are space clusters existing for some time period , the collision rate is higher than that expected for the uniform system .",
    "it was found only in @xmath117 and not in other cases because in the @xmath117 case , particles are moving very slowly , and they stay in clusters for much longer time .",
    "we traced the origin of the non - uniform distribution .",
    "it was caused by some correlation of random number generators ( see appendix  b ) . when we use ran1 from @xcite , and generate first the momenta for all the particles and then generate the positions for all the particles , there are no abnormal fluctuations .",
    "when we generate momentum and position together , we found abnormal fluctuations .",
    "this does not occur when ran3 from @xcite is used .",
    "we correct the generation by separating the generation of particle momentum and particle position .",
    "from the above study , we show that the equation of state and the collision rate can be used to test the initial conditions and collision mechanisms of relativistic parton cascade . for massless particles , when the interaction range is much larger than the mean free path , the cascade collision rate is lower than the theoretical value .",
    "other methods , e.g. , particle partition , have to be used to correct the collision rate .",
    "the comparison of free streaming and interacting cascade approach to equilibrium indicate qualitative similarities of the two cases . however , the damping and speed of collective motion are quite different",
    ". a detailed comparison of free streaming , ideal hydrodynamics , and cascade approach to global equilibrium in the case of half filled periodic box initial conditions will be addresses in another paper @xcite .    as discussed in this paper , spatial distribution with larger than statistical fluctuations gives higher than thermal reaction rate .",
    "hijing @xcite predicts initial spatial clusters of partons for nucleus - nucleus collisions at collider energies . this implies higher than thermal collision rates",
    "@xcite and many other interesting physical phenomena beyond the widely used hot gluon scenario @xcite predictions .",
    "we emphasize the importance of using analytic tests in debugging numerical simulation codes .",
    "the spatial distribution with abnormal fluctuations illustrates well the usefulness of the analytic collision rate test .",
    "as more components are added to the cascade code , more tests will be needed to ensure the consistency of different parts of the cascade code and to enable disentangling of the actual physical assumptions that define the model . + * acknowledgments * + we thank s. a. chin , p. danielewicz , v. koch , b. a. li , s. pratt , j. randrup for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank brookhaven national laboratory and lawrence berkeley laboratory for providing computing facilities .",
