    "the study of smooth manifolds with positive sectional curvature ( @xmath6 ) is a classical subject in riemannian geometry ; however , surprisingly little is understood about such manifolds .",
    "on the one hand , there are very few known topological obstructions . on the other hand , there is also a dramatic scarcity of examples besides spheres and projective spaces ( see @xcite for a survey ) . a natural approach to deal with the latter issue is to search for examples with many symmetries  @xcite . perhaps the most compelling motivations for this approach are the achievements of the classification of compact simply - connected homogeneous spaces with @xmath6 , due to wallach  @xcite in even dimensions , and brard - bergery  @xcite in odd dimensions , see also wilking and ziller  @xcite . in the process of this classification , wallach  @xcite discovered three new examples of closed manifolds with @xmath6 , that are commonly referred to as the _ wallach flag manifolds _ : @xmath7 these are the manifolds of complete flags in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , and are the total spaces of homogeneous sphere bundles over the corresponding projective planes @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see section  [ sec : flags ] for details .    in this paper , we revisit the moduli spaces of positively curved homogeneous metrics on the wallach flag manifolds ( obtained by valiev  @xcite ) , under the light of _ strongly positive curvature_. a riemannian manifold @xmath11 has strongly positive curvature if there exists @xmath12 such that the modified curvature operator @xmath13 is positive - definite .",
    "a systematic study of this condition was initiated by the authors in @xcite , propelled by the discovery that it is preserved under riemannian submersions and cheeger deformations .",
    "its origins are reminiscent of the work of thorpe  @xcite , and such notion was also used by authors including pttmann  @xcite , and grove , verdiani and ziller  @xcite , who coined the term .",
    "the interest in this curvature condition is largely due to it being intermediate between @xmath6 and positive - definiteness of the curvature operator .",
    "we recall that , while many questions on manifolds with @xmath6 remain open , the only simply - connected manifolds to admit positive - definite curvature operator are spheres  @xcite .",
    "strongly positive curvature has the potential to improve the understanding of the gap between these classes .",
    "our main result is a precise description of the moduli spaces of homogeneous metrics with strongly positive curvature on the wallach flag manifolds . for the sake of brevity , we state it in terms of the moduli spaces of homogeneous metrics with @xmath6 , originally obtained by valiev  @xcite , see also pttmann  @xcite ; however , we stress that our proof is independent of these previous results .",

    "apart from @xmath2 , which was left undecided , we proved in our previous work ( * ? ? ? * thm .",
    "c ) that the only closed simply - connected homogeneous space with @xmath6 that does not admit a homogeneous metric with strongly positive curvature is the cayley plane @xmath10 . by verifying that @xmath2 admits homogeneous metrics with strongly positive curvature , theorem  [ mainthm ] yields the following classification result :    [ classification ] all simply - connected homogeneous spaces with @xmath6 admit a homogeneous metric with strongly positive curvature , except for @xmath10 .    despite not admitting a homogeneous metric with strongly positive curvature ,",

    "thus , @xmath20 is an equivariant symmetric linear operator , and hence , by schur s lemma , has a certain block diagonal canonical form based on the decomposition of @xmath21 into irreducible factors . in particular ,",
    "@xmath20 can be tested for positive - definiteness using its matrix on a suitable basis of _ representatives_. the process to find @xmath19 such that @xmath20 is positive - definite employs a first - order argument consisting of two steps .",
    "the first step is to find @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is positive - semidefinite ; and the second step is to find @xmath24 with positive - definite restriction to the kernel of @xmath23 . in this case , @xmath25 satisfies the desired property for any sufficiently small @xmath26 .",
    "the only cases in which this process fails are those corresponding to normal homogeneous metrics , and the homogeneous metrics on @xmath2 that submerge onto @xmath10 .",
    "these do not have strongly positive curvature as a consequence of ( * ? ? ?",
    ".  a , c ) .    as a byproduct of the above proof (",
    "specifically , the first step of finding @xmath22 in the first - order argument ) , we obtain a complete description of the moduli spaces of homogeneous metrics with strongly _ nonnegative _ curvature on these manifolds :    [ strongnonneg ] a homogenous metric on @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 has strongly nonnegative curvature if and only if it has @xmath27 .",
    "this result motivates the question of which constructions of metrics with @xmath27 yield metrics with strongly nonnegative curvature , which will be addressed in @xcite .",
