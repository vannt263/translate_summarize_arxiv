    "understanding the formation of disk galaxies remains a primary but elusive goal in cosmology .",
    "the standard scenario for disk formation entails the quiescent , dissipational collapse of rotating gas clouds within virialized dark matter halos @xcite , and this picture successfully explains the angular momentum content , size , and kinematical structure of observed systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , cdm - based cosmological simulations of disk galaxy formation have had difficulty producing high angular momentum disks without large bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , almost certainly in part due to the fact that mergers are common in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "more recent simulations have faired better by including strong feedback , which suppresses star formation and thereby reduces the collisionless heating associated with stellar mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter , r06a ) presented a supplemental `` merger - driven '' scenario for the cosmological disk galaxy formation where extremely gas - rich mergers at high - redshift lead to rapidly - rotating remnant systems with large gaseous and stellar disks .",
    "building on work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , r06a used a suite of hydrodynamical simulations to study gas rich mergers of various gas fractions , mass ratios , and orbital properties , and concluded that hierarchical structure formation and the regulation of star formation may work in concert to build disk galaxies through gas - rich mergers .",
    "subsequent cosmological simulations have reported the formation of milky way - like disk galaxies in gas - rich mergers @xcite , and @xcite have examined merger remnants in order to gain a phenomenological understanding of disk survival in gas - rich mergers . given that high gas fractions are the essential ingredient in this scenario , observations at high - redshift ( when gas fractions were higher and mergers more common ) provide an important testing ground for models of disk galaxy formation .",
    "only recently have detailed observations of high - redshift disks been possible . @xcite",
    "measured the rotation curves of uv - selected @xmath0 galaxies ( the bm / bx sample , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with @xmath3 slit spectroscopy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used the sinfoni integral field spectrograph @xcite to measure spatially - resolved kinematics of 14 bm / bx galaxies , and found rotating systems with large specific angular momenta but significant random motions ( @xmath4 ) .    among the best - studied high - redhift disks",
    "is @xmath2 at @xmath1 , which was found using the @xmath5 photometric selection technique @xcite .",
    "* hereafter g06 ) used the sinfoni spectrograph with adaptive optics on the very large telescope ( vlt ) to measure the kinematic structure @xmath2 with an incredible spatial resolution of 0.15 \" ( @xmath6 at @xmath7 ) .",
    "these observations revealed massive ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) rotating disk galaxy with a large star formation rate ( @xmath10 ) and substantial random motions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the inferred gas consumption timescale for @xmath2 is only @xmath12 , or about one - tenth the age of the universe at @xmath13 , and implies a remarkably rapid acquisition of its mass . nonetheless g06 conclude that @xmath2 is not a merger remnant because it displays velocity fields similar to those expected for quiescent disks",
    ".    the existence of high - redshift disks that have not experienced large mergers may be surprising in light of @xmath14cdm expectations .",
    "the merger rate per dark matter halo is predicted to be a factor of @xmath15 times higher at @xmath16 than at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "approximately @xmath18 of galaxy - size halos at @xmath7 should have undergone a nearly one - to - one merger ( @xmath19 ) in the last @xmath20 , and @xmath21 should have experienced a @xmath22 merger in the last @xmath23 gyr ( stewart , bullock et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "however , these mergers are expected to be gas rich .",
    "observations of galaxies at @xmath0 imply gas fractions @xmath24 times higher than for nearby galaxies at fixed stellar mass @xcite .",
    "these two pieces of information motivate us to consider gas - rich mergers as a means to explain @xmath25 galaxies with young stellar populations , short gas exhaustion timescales , and disk - like kinematics .",
    "any model that attempts to explain the properties of high - redshift disks must not only reproduce their bulk properties ( stellar masses , rotational velocities , gas fractions , star formation rates , etc . ) but also their detailed kinematic properties .",
    "an important kinematic metric for classifying high - redshift galaxies as disks was developed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s08 ) , who extended the `` kinemetry '' technique of @xcite in order to examine the velocity fields of @xmath0 galaxies from @xcite and g06 .",
    "specifically , s08 provided a straightforward means to classify @xmath0 galaxies as disks based on the symmetry of their velocity fields .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to determine whether galaxies formed in a gas - rich mergers can match the observed properties of @xmath26 disks .",
    "we describe our simulations in  [ section : methodology ] and the kinematical analysis in  [ section : kinemetry ] . in ",
    "[ section : results ] we demonstrate that a set of gas - rich merger remnants satisfy the disk galaxy kinematical classification developed by s08 , and compare one of the remnants in particular to the detailed properties of @xmath2 .",
    "overall , we find good agreement between the properties of simulated disk galaxies formed in gas - rich mergers and observed @xmath0 disks like @xmath2 .",
    "we assume a @xmath27 cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and a hubble parameter of @xmath30 .",
    "the simulations studied here are culled from the simulation suite presented in r06a . for details of the simulation methodology",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , but a summary follows .",
    "the simulations are calculated using the n - body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "each binary merger occurs during a parabolic encounter between otherwise isolated disk galaxies .",
    "the progenitor galaxy models contain gaseous and stellar disks embedded in massive dark matter halos , with structural parameters scaled appropriately for disk galaxies in the @xmath27 cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas and stars are initialized in exponential disks with a scale height @xmath31 to scale length @xmath32 ratio of @xmath33 , while the dark matter halo is initialized as rotating ( @xmath34 ) @xcite distribution with an approximate @xcite concentration of @xmath35 ( the simulations of r06a were initialized for concentrations typical of @xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that while the concentration is higher than that expected for similar mass halos at @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the integrated mass within the central @xmath36 is approximately correct . the evolution in halo concentrations with redshift is primarily driven by growth in halo virial radii with time , while halo central densities remain approximately constant ( see , e.g. , figure 18 of * ? ? ?",
    "the progenitor galaxy models each contain 40,000 gas , 40,000 stellar disk , and 180,000 dark matter halo particles , with a gravitational softening of @xmath37 .",
    "the prescription for star formation and interstellar medium ( ism ) physics in the simulations follows the @xcite model that implements a sub - resolution treatment of supernova feedback and the multiphase ism .",
    "star formation operates in the dense ism , following a @xcite law where the star formation timescale decreases with the local dynamical time .",
    "the simulations of r06a utilize the strong supernova feedback supplied by the @xcite multiphase ism model to suppress star formation sufficiently during a merger to allow remnant disks to form .",
    "the simulations do not include an ultraviolet ( uv ) background , but we note that the increased uv background at @xmath0 would tend to suppress the overall gas consumption during the merger and may act to increase the rotational support of the final remnants .",
    "for comparison with the observations of @xmath2 by g06 , we focus on a single equal - mass coplanar binary merger of disk galaxies with virial velocities @xmath38 and a pericentric passage distance of @xmath39 .",
    "the model is simulation `` ge '' in the study by r06a ( see their table 1 ) and is similar to the simulation studied by @xcite . at the time of final coalescence @xmath40 after the first passage , the merging system is @xmath41 gas and experiences a large burst of star formation .",
    "the system averages @xmath42 until reaching a quiescent rate of @xmath43 approximately @xmath44 later .",
    "we analyze the simulation on the declining peak of the vigorous star formation burst , approximately @xmath45 after the start of the final coalescence ( roughly @xmath46 before the third panel of figure 1 in r06a ) . by this stage ,",
    "a large gaseous disk has formed from the residual angular momentum of the merger .",
    "eventually , the system forms a rotationally - supported stellar component with a majority of its stellar mass distributed in thin and thick disks ( see figures 2 and 3 and table 2 of r06a ) .",
    "the kinematical properties of the simulated merger remnants are analyzed using a method designed to closely approximate the integral field spectroscopy studies of @xcite and g06 .",
    "figure [ fig : vel_field ] illustrates this analysis for the ge remnant from r06a discussed in  2 .",
    "the disk is inclined to @xmath47 and rotated to a major kinematic axis position angle of @xmath48 west of north in order to match @xmath2 ( see g06 , their figure 3 ) .",
    "star - forming gas and diffuse gas with a temperature in the range @xmath49k are selected to approximate the observed @xmath3-emitting gas and the size of the simulated galaxy is scaled to the redshift of @xmath2 , @xmath1 ( see the angular scale bar in panels a - c of figure [ fig : vel_field ] ) .",
    "the three columns of figure [ fig : vel_field ] show gas surface mass density ( smd ) , line - of - sight velocity @xmath50 , and velocity dispersion @xmath51 maps of the simulated disk gas displayed at three different smoothing scales .",
    "the upper row ( a , b , c ) is rendered at high resolution . note the clear disk morphology ( a ) and disk - like velocity field ( b ) , while the random motions ( c ) are larger than for thin disks in the local universe ( we measure , @xmath52 in the remnant gas disk ) . in the middle row ( d , e , f )",
    "the fields are smoothed by a gaussian kernel with a fwhm@xmath53 in order mimic the angular resolution obtained by g06 .",
    "galaxies have @xmath54 resolution ( see @xcite and s08 ) . ] in the lower row ( g , h , i ) the smoothed maps are then binned to the @xmath55 pixel scale of the sinfoni observations by g06 and gaussian noise is added to match the typical velocity errors reported by s08 ( see their figure 6 ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the kinemetry analysis provides a detailed exposition of the kinematical structure of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the comparatively coarser data available for @xmath0 galaxies motivated s08 to use a mean kinemetric analysis where the asymmetries are characterized by averages of the amplitude coefficients in equation [ equation : kinemetry ] .",
    "re - writing the kinemetry coefficients as @xmath79 , s08 introduced average velocity and velocity dispersion asymmetry parameters @xmath80 where the subscripts @xmath81 and @xmath82 refer to quantities calculated from the @xmath50 and @xmath51 maps , and the subscript @xmath83 indicates that the average is performed over the ellipses at different radii used in the kinemetry analysis .",
    "we use the kinemetry code made available by d. krajnovic to calculate @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the simulated disk remnant .",
    "the kinemetry is performed over six ellipses separated by @xmath86 pixels in the map , roughly corresponding to the resolution of the simulated image to minimize beam smearing effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ellipse position angles and aspect ratios are fixed to reflect the best fit values for @xmath2 adopted from g06 .",
    "the number , spacing , and orientation of the ellipses can change the precise values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , but do not alter the conclusions or interpretations of this work . increasing the level of noise in the simulated maps will tend to increase the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and would likely degrade the capability of the simulations to match the observations rather than improve our results .",
    "we note that while the kinemetry method @xcite has previously been used analyze simulated merger remnants @xcite , only very gas - rich mergers are expected to be associated with disk formation and kinemetry has not yet been performed on such systems .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ fig : vel_field ] shows the smd , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 maps used to perform the kinematical analysis of the remnant disk .",
    "the average kinemetric parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( equation 2 ) are measured from the velocity maps . for the disk merger remnant plotted in figure [ fig : vel_field ]",
    "we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which reflect the relative symmetry the velocity fields .",
    "the combined asymmetry parameter @xmath89 provides a global characterization of asymmetry in the kinematical structure of the galaxy , and s08 suggest @xmath90 as an observational criterion for distinguishing between disk galaxies and mergers .",
    "the disk remnant examined in figure [ fig : vel_field ] satisfies this criterion with @xmath91 , even though it was formed in an equal mass , gas - rich merger .",
    "we have performed the same analysis on a range of other simulated merger remnant disk galaxies from r06a . in each case , we examine the merger product soon after the merger and @xmath92 after the time of the final coalescence .",
    "we find similar results for disk remnants formed in gas - rich major polar mergers ( r06a simulation gcof , @xmath93 ) , major inclined mergers ( r06a simulation gcoo , @xmath94 ) , and minor ( 1:8 mass ratio ) coplanar mergers ( r06a simulation fcm , @xmath95 ) .",
    "if real galaxy analogues of these simulated galaxies were observed with sinfoni , a kinematical analysis would likely classify them ( correctly ) as disks .",
    "we emphasize that in each case the gas disk develops rapidly , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 both declining by factors of @xmath98 within @xmath99 of the height of merger coalescence .    while both the simulated disk merger remnants and observed @xmath0 disk galaxies satisfy the observational criterion of s08 designed to identify disk galaxies , the simulations should also closely match other observed properties of @xmath0 disks . consider the galaxy @xmath2 observed by g06 , which has an inferred star formation rate of @xmath100 and a dynamical mass of @xmath101 within a radius of @xmath102 .",
    "the simulated disk remnant analyzed in figure [ fig : vel_field ] has an average star formation rate of @xmath103 over the previous @xmath46 and a dynamical mass of @xmath104 .",

    "overall , the galaxy @xmath2 displays properties that are remarkably similar to the example simulated disk galaxy merger remnant shown in figure [ fig : vel_field ] .",
    "we note that the properties of @xmath0 disks like @xmath2 are rather extreme compared with local , isolated disk galaxies .",
    "the gas surface density , star formation rate , and random motions ( @xmath96 ) of @xmath2 are roughly an order of magnitude larger than for the milky way , even as their rotational velocities are similar and their stellar masses differ by less than 50% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulated disk remnant displays similar properties ( see table [ table : properties ] ) owing to the dynamical effects of the merger from which it formed .",
    "it is possible that such a pre - formed ( hot ) disk would tend to settle into a more classical milky - way type thin disk at late times if the pre - formed stars adjust to to the infall of ( quiescent ) gas - disk material , as might be expected in a more classical stage of disk formation .",
    "subsequent gaseous infall from the intergalactic medium may also help prolong star formation in the remnant and increase the gas disk scale length .    while the observed properties of @xmath0 disks resemble simulated disk systems formed in gas - rich mergers , other viable explanations for their origin exist .",
