    "as discussed in @xcite , lyc leakage can take place through two basic scenarios  leakage through a radiation - bounded nebula with holes or leakage through a density - bounded nebula . as demonstrated in that paper ,",
    "the two mechanisms give rise to similar predictions in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram in the dust - free case .",
    "things get more complicated when dust effects are considered , since the direct absorption of lyman continuum photons of dust ( see section  [ lyc_extinction ] ) is likely to be more important in the density - bounded case . in this paper , we for simplicity focus on the case of radiation - bounded nebulae with holes free of both gas and dust . since a number of recent observations ( see section  [ density - bounded ] )",
    "indicate that density - bounded nebula may also be highly relevant , we are planning a follow - up paper dedicated to this specific mode of lyc escape .",
    "however , the impact of dust attenuation on this sed does not necessarily weaken with increasing @xmath0 since all the light received by a passes through dusty regions ( grey ) .",
    "the galaxy sed seen by observer b , on the other hand , contains a fraction of direct , unattenuated starlight .",
    "[ schematic ] ]      to account for the effects of dust in the rest - frame uv / optical , we consider two alternative recipes developed by f13 and s14 for predicting the attenuation of simulated galaxies . in the f13 recipe ,",
    "the rest - frame color excess @xmath46 is based on a deterministic part related to the overall stellar population metallicity @xmath35 , plus a random component @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a gaussian component with a variance equal to half of the metallicity - dependent component . in the case of our @xmath15 sample of galaxies from the @xcite simulations , this gives an average @xmath50 , which converts into average @xmath510.2 magnitudes ( where the exact value depends on the attenuation law ; see below ) .",
    "the s14 recipe is based on the metallicity , total stellar mass and the spatial distribution of stars within each galaxy , with free model parameters calibrated against the rest - frame uv luminosity function at @xmath15 ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "the end result is a prediction of the 1500  attenuation ( @xmath52 ) for each galaxy , which converts into an average optical extinction that is somewhat higher than for the f13 case , with @xmath530.4 depending on the attenuation law .",
    "once either @xmath46  the finlator case  or @xmath52  the shimizu case  has been established , we consider a number of different wavelength - dependent dust attenuation laws to apply reddening throughout the full wavelength range of our model seds : the lmc and smc attenuation laws by @xcite or the @xcite attenuation law for starburst galaxies . in the case of the lmc and smc attenuation laws , we assume the attenuation to affect the stellar and nebular portions of the sed by an equal factor . in the @xcite case , we allow the reddening of the stellar component either to be equal to that of the nebular one ( @xmath54 ) , or a factor of 0.44 lower ( @xmath55 , i.e. the case actually advocated by @xcite ) .",
    "the higher @xmath46 implied for the nebular component in the latter case is usually interpreted as an effect of age - dependent attenuation , in the sense that young star - forming regions are embedded within thick dust cocoons that disperse over time .",
    "one would then expect the @xmath56 ratio to depend on star formation history , effectively approaching unity in cases where all stars have the same age or when young star - forming regions come to dominate the spectrum . indeed",
    ", observational studies support this , indicating that @xmath57 depends on the specific star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to capture this variation in @xmath57 across a sample of simulated galaxies",
    ", it would seem more realistic to apply age - dependent attenuation corrections to each star particle separately , rather than relying on galaxy - wide attenuation corrections .",
    "however , tests using the age - dependent dust attenuation recipe developed by @xcite  with parameters tuned to make the average uv slope @xmath2 of the @xmath15 galaxy population agree with observations  applied to each star particle indicates that this produces results that are qualitatively similar to the @xmath55 case in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram . throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", we will therefore consider galaxy - wide attenuation corrections only .",
    "the effect of dust reddening on the observed sed may potentially be reduced in the case of very high @xmath0 , but the impact of this effect is likely to depend on the geometry of gas , stars and dust , the level of leakage isotropy and the viewing angle of the observer .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in figure  [ schematic ] , where two observers a and b are viewing an ionization - bounded nebula with holes from different angles .",
    "observer a measures an sed where all the starlight and nebular emission has passed through a dust screen , which  at least to first order  may be considered to be unaffected by @xmath0 ( this is hereafter referred to as scenario a ) .",
    "observer b , on the other hand , measures an sed which contains a fraction of unattenuated starlight . in the case of highly isotropic leakage through many thin escape channels , a fraction @xmath0 of the starlight directed towards observer b may be unaffected by dust whereas a fraction @xmath58 experiences dust attenuation ( hereafter scenario b ) .",
    "however , these are admittedly not the only options , since anisotropic leakage could allow a fraction of unattenuated starlight different from the global @xmath0 to escape in the direction of b. throughout this paper , we consider scenario a the default option , but also explore the consequences of scenario b on the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram .",
    "to provide realistic simulations of galaxy spectra as they would appear when observed with the jwst / nirspec instrument , our model also allows the option of degrading the quality of the simulated seds by taking the noise and limited spectral resolution into account , following the jwst / nirspec - specific recipe described in @xcite .",
    "as an example of how @xmath0 affects the sed in the wavelength range relevant for jwst / nirspec , we in figure  [ seds ] show the predicted sed of a dust - free , @xmath59 galaxy from the @xcite batch at @xmath15 for various @xmath0 , with and without instrumental effects ( noise and degraded spectral resolution ) . here , we have assumed a very long exposure time ( @xmath60 h ) using the @xmath61 nirspec grism . as argued by @xcite",
    ", @xmath0 mainly affects the strengths of emission lines compared to the continuum , and while observational effects will render the weaker emission lines undetectable , several strong emission lines remain useful as lyc leakage diagnostics , including [ oii]@xmath623727 , h@xmath63 , h@xmath2 , [ oiii]@xmath624959 and [ oiii]@xmath625007 . while the [ oii]@xmath623727 and [ oiii]@xmath625007 emission lines actually appear as the strongest lines in the sed , the relative strengths of these lines is sensitive to the mechanism of lyc leakage , and may be very different in case of a density - bounded nebula compared to the matter - bounded nebula with holes assumed here .",
    "following @xcite , we therefore focus on the diagnostic properties of the balmer line h@xmath2 ( 4863  ; the third strongest line in the sed plotted ) , as the predictions of this line are very similar in the two cases .",
    "in figure  [ no_dust ] , we show the behavior of dust - free galaxies with various @xmath0 from the s14 , croc , f13 and fiby simulation suites in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram . here ,",
    "@xmath2 ( defined as @xmath64 ) is derived from the ten wavelength intervals in the rest - frame range @xmath65-2580  defined by @xcite .",
    "all seds are here based on geneva stellar evolutionary tracks . in the case of the first three simulation suites , we explore the effects of @xmath66 ( red dots ) , 0.5 ( orange ) , 0.7 ( green ) and 0.9 ( blue ) , whereas @xmath0 is self - consistently predicted in the case of the fiby galaxies .",
    "the latter objects have been color - coded to match the @xmath0 bins that they are deemed to fall closest to ( most at @xmath66 but a few at @xmath67 ) .",
    "+   +    while galaxy - to - galaxy variations in star formation history and metallicity distributions induces a considerable scatter in ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 space , the different @xmath0 models still produce relatively well - separated regions in this diagram .",
    "this suggests that the method proposed by @xcite to identify high-@xmath0 galaxies is robust to uncertainties regarding the ages and metallicity stellar populations of galaxies at these redshifts , at least in the absence of dust attenuation . in figure  [ no_dust]d , we compare the predicted distribution of objects in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram for 100 randomly - selected croc galaxies at @xmath15 and @xmath68 .",
    "while @xmath68 galaxies have slightly bluer @xmath2 and higher ew(h@xmath2 ) due to their somewhat lower ages , the evolution between these redshifts is marginal , which means that our @xmath15 results should apply to the whole @xmath159 interval .",
    "the regions spanned by different @xmath0 are also relatively consistent among the four simulations used . however , since the simulations display different galaxy - to - galaxy diversity in star formation history and metallicity distribution ( an effect also seen in figure  [ sfh_z ] ) , the compactness of the regions differ . for instance , the croc galaxies exhibit smaller and more well - defined regions than the others , mainly due to their smoother star formation histories .",
    "while the diagnostic value of the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram in identifying high-@xmath0 galaxies appears robust to variations in star formation history and metallicity ( at least at the level of variation seen in the four simulation suites explored ) , there are other model uncertainties that could potentially bias the outcome . any stellar population property that substantially boosts the ionizing stellar ultraviolet continuum compared to",
    "the non - ionizing ultraviolet continuum flux would result in a bias of the @xmath0 inferred from observations , if not accounted for in the models .    a generic prediction when approaching the population iii metallicity regime ( @xmath69 ) is a boost in the characteristic mass of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , this would have a very pronounced impact on the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram by pushing objects upwards ( towards redder @xmath2 slopes ) through a boost in the relative impact of nebular emission at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "while our simulations predict mean metallicites @xmath70 for all galaxies sufficiently massive to be within range of nirspec at @xmath5 , there is a minority of star particles with metallicities ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath41 in these objects , for which the choice of the @xcite imf could certainly be questioned .",
    "however , for this to have any significant effect on the total sed also requires that these galaxies are caught in the phase where these particular star particles are younger than a few myr .",
    "this condition is never met by more than @xmath72 of the star particles in any of our simulated galaxies and there is consequently no outliers predicted at very red @xmath2 in figure  [ no_dust ] , even if the extremely top - heavy population iii imf considered by @xcite is applied to the @xmath73 particles .",
    "we therefore conclude that the assumptions on the behavior of the imf at very low metallicities is not a major hurdle for our method to measure @xmath0 .",
    "uncertainties in the treatment of stellar evolution at higher metallicities can also be important , and recent studies have highlighted that both stellar rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and binary evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may affect the ionizing fluxes of stellar populations by factors of a few .",
    "since model grids that treat such effects have yet to be released for the full range of metallicities seen in our simulated galaxies , a completely self - consistent test of such effects is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "however , since the fraction of star particles at metallicities @xmath74 is low , a reasonable assessment of effects can nonetheless be made by exchanging the model grids at higher metallicities for those based on assumption different from those in our default batch . in figure  [ model_tracks]a",
    ", we demonstrate the effects of switching from sb99 models based on geneva stellar evolutionary tracks to padova stellar evolutionary tracks in the case of the s14 galaxies .",
    "this turns out to have a very modest impact on the predicted position of galaxies in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram , and would not bias @xmath0 estimates in any significant way . a more dramatic effect",
    "is seen in figure  [ model_tracks]b , where we show the effect of making a corresponding switch from sb99 geneva models for single stars to bpass models for binary stars . in this case , both the ew(h@xmath2 ) and @xmath2 distributions of the galaxy population are shifted , by as much as @xmath75 ( i.e. a factor of @xmath76 shift in ew(h@xmath2 ) ) and by @xmath77 .    however , it should be possible to probe the observational data for signs of mismatches between the stellar evolution assumptions adopted in the simulations and the stellar evolution taking place in real galaxies , and thereby calibrate the models before attempting to infer @xmath0 .",
    "such calibrations can either be done at low redshifts , by simply testing models based on different assumptions concerning stellar rotation and binarity against local stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or directly from jwst / nirspec observations of galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ model_tracks]b , because of the higher ionizing fluxes produced once binary stars are considered , bpass predicts the presence of galaxies with @xmath78 galaxies at @xmath15 that are not predicted to exist in the case of models without binary evolution .",
    "hence , the detection of a substantial number of objects with such properties would clearly invalidate our default models based on the evolution of single stars .      at low levels of lyc leakage ,",
    "the different dust attenuation recipes described in section  [ sed_modelling ] give rise to mean optical ( rest - frame @xmath79-band ) attenuation values of @xmath800.4 mag , depending on the dust attenuation curve adopted , which leads to average uv @xmath2 slopes of @xmath81 to @xmath82 , in rough agreement with current observations of @xmath1 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+   +    since both the h@xmath2 and h@xmath63 emission lines are readily detectable with jwst / nirspec at @xmath169 , and since the intrinsic line ratio is well - constrained from recombination theory , @xcite suggested that these lines could be used to correct nirspec spectra for dust reddening at these redshifts .",
    "however , we find that the modest optical dust attenuation combined with the relatively weak h@xmath63 line ( rest - frame equivalent width @xmath83 10  in the case of @xmath66 and even weaker for higher @xmath0 ) predicted for our simulated galaxies will in most cases make it practically impossible to apply any sensible dust corrections this way .",
    "machine learning methods that exploit the combined marginal detections of several weak spectral features ( e.g. h@xmath63 , h@xmath84 , h@xmath85 ... ) may still be able to provide some handle on the dust reddening , although with substantial uncertainties @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ewbetadust_casea ] illustrates the effect of dust on the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram for galaxies where the viewing angle corresponds to scenario a ( i.e. @xmath0-independent attenuation ) .",
    "the different panels show the behavior of s14 galaxies subject to the lmc , smc , calzetti @xmath54 and calzetti @xmath55 attenuation laws . the behavior of galaxies from the other simulation suites subject to the finlator dust recipe is very similar .",
    "the effects of the lmc , smc and calzetti @xmath54 attenuation laws ( figure  [ ewbetadust_casea]abd ) is to significantly reduce the usefulness of the @xmath2 slope as a diagnostic of lyc leakage , since @xmath2 becomes dominated by dust effects rather than the recent star formation history . because of this , the @xmath2 distribution becomes very similar for all @xmath0 considered , and ew(h@xmath2 ) may by itself then be used to gauge @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is , however , quite different for the calzetti @xmath55 case ( figure  [ ewbetadust_casea]c ) , since dust attenuation in this case not only affects @xmath2 , but simultaneously also decreases ew(h@xmath2 ) by diminishing the relative impact of nebular emission in the spectrum .",
    "galaxies therefore form diagonal distributions in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram , qualitatively similar to the dust - free case depicted in figure  [ no_dust ] but extending to redder @xmath2 .",
    "inferring @xmath0 from the position of a single galaxy in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram would lead to significant degeneracies without any knowledge on the effective attenuation law . as an example , consider the position of a galaxy at @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the lmc , smc and calzetti @xmath54 cases ,",
    "the lyc leakage would be inferred to be @xmath880.7 , whereas in the @xmath55 case , one would infer @xmath890.5 .",
    "information on the effective attenuation law from observations at slightly lower redshifts may help guide the analysis , and so may the distribution of objects at @xmath5 in the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram itself ( similarly to the situation discussion in section  [ stellar_evolution ] ) , but a case in which the effective attenuation law changes from galaxy to galaxy at @xmath5 would inevitably lead to a very problematic situation .    figure  [ ewbetadust_caseb ] illustrates the effect of dust on the ew(h@xmath2)-@xmath2 diagram in the alternative scenario b ( where unattenuated starlight escapes along the line of sight , leading to @xmath0-dependent dust attenuation ) for an lmc attenuation law . at @xmath66 (",
    "not shown ) , scenario b gives predictions identical to those of scenario a in figure  [ ewbetadust_casea ] , but at higher @xmath0 , scenario b produces seds with @xmath2 slopes that are more similar to the completely dust - free case in figure  [ no_dust ] .",
    "hence , the @xmath2 slope can in this scenario appear very blue even though there is substantial dust attenuation in the galaxy .",
    "this happens because the unattenuated fraction @xmath0 of the starlight ( which give very blue @xmath2 ) comes to dominate the rest - frame uv continuum and hence the overall @xmath2 slope . at @xmath90 , the predicted distribution of @xmath2 slopes",
    "is only marginally different from the dust - free case ( here shown as symbols in a darker shade ) .",
    "the ew(h@xmath2 ) distribution at these very high @xmath0 is , on the other hand , expected to be shifted to ew(h@xmath2 ) slightly lower than in the dust - free case due to a boost in the overall h@xmath2 continuum from the direct , unattenuated starlight .",
    "in previous sections , we have demonstrated that indirect spectral signatures of lyc leakage in the rest - frame ultraviolet and optical should be readily detectable with jwst / nirspec at @xmath159 , and that individual galaxies with very high lyc escape fractions ( @xmath91 ) should be identifiable at these redshifts based on their position in their uv @xmath2 slope vs ew(h@xmath2 ) diagram . in a companion paper @xcite , we also show that the full range of spectral information available from jwst / nirspec , low - resolution spectra should allow for constraints with a mean statistical error of @xmath92 .",
    "this method of using continuum and emission - line data to constrain lyc leakage from reionization - epoch galaxies has the obvious advantage over competing methods based on absorption lines @xcite of not requiring high spectral resolution or as high signal - to - noise ratio , which means that it can be applied to much larger samples of @xmath5 galaxies . a recent attempt to test the method based on low - ionization metal absorption lines using direct lyc measurements at @xmath93 also failed to verify the predicted lyc flux @xcite , indicating potential problems with this approach .",
    "one can , however , envision similar problems with our proposed method as well . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss a number of potential pitfalls that require further consideration .      as pointed out by @xcite , the method of using the relative strength of emission lines to assess @xmath0 would overestimate @xmath0 in cases where",
    "some non - negligible fraction of the lyc photons that do not escape is directly absorbed by dust rather than gas .",
    "for instance , the models presented by @xcite suggest that dust attenuation may reduce the fraction of ionizing photons captured by gas by a factor of @xmath94 even at @xmath119 .",
    "observations of the rest - frame far - ir continuum from dust emission can constrain the level of lyc extinction @xcite and the study by @xcite suggests that this mechanism may have a substantial impact on @xmath0 for lyc - leaking galaxies at low redshift . however , at @xmath5 , the dust continuum gets redshifted into the sub - mm regime and is hence outside the wavelength range of jwst . in the case of the very brightest reionization - epoch galaxies ,",
    "the dust continuum can be probed by alma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the sensitivity limits of alma makes this impossible for the vast majority of @xmath5 galaxies within reach of jwst / nirspec .",
    "alma observations of the redshifted dust continuum is far less challenging at @xmath95 @xcite , where the opacity of the igm still allows direct detection of escaping lyc .",
    "hence , it should at least be possible to assess how pronounced lyc extinction is in bright , high-@xmath0 galaxies @xmath96 gyr after cosmic reionization has completed .      due to the relatively limited wavelength range within reach of jwst / nirspec for galaxies at @xmath169 ( rest - frame wavelengths 1216 to @xmath977100  , depending on the exact redshift ) , it is possible to come up with scenarios that are bound to lead the jwst analysis of such galaxies astray",
    ". objects with very high dust obscuration would represent a particularly troublesome case .",
    "consider the case where supernovae punch small holes through an extremely dusty and opaque ism , so that some small fraction @xmath0 of starlight is escaping without any attenuation by gas or dust whatsoever , whereas the rest is subject to very high dust attenuation .",
    "this resembles our viewing angle scenario b , but with far more pronounced dust effects outside the holes than considered in our simulations .",
    "the unobscured part could then completely dominate the rest - frame ultraviolet / optical light .",
    "if the unobscured region is young , the observed spectrum would exhibit a very blue uv slope and extremely weak emission lines ",
    "the tell - tale signatures of a very high overall @xmath0  despite the fact that the global @xmath0 is very low .",
    "in fact , @xcite have proposed a model of this type to explain the observed properties of @xmath15 galaxies , adopting @xmath98 and an optical attenuation of @xmath99 magnitudes over the attenuated regions . as in the case of direct lyc absorption by dust",
    "( section  [ lyc_extinction ] ) , the most direct way to get an observational handle on this scenario would likely be auxiliary observations of the very brightest jwst / nirspec targets with alma @xcite .",
    "one may also be able to address this using ensemble statistics .",
    "if a significant fraction of star formation is generally completely blocked by dust , then the stellar mass is growing much faster than what is inferred from the rest - frame ultraviolet . by comparing the simultaneous growth of the rest - frame ultraviolet and optical luminosity functions in time",
    ", it may then be possible to assess whether this is a dominant mode .",
    "a similar complication could arise for galaxies that have two ( or more ) blended components with vastly different dust and lyc escape properties .",
    "if a high - mass component with @xmath66 experiences too high attenuation to contribute substantially to the observed jwst / nirspec sed , a low - mass , low - obscuration @xmath100 component could come to dominate the observed sed . in this case , any @xmath0 estimate based on our methods would refer solely to the latter component . in a scenario of this kind",
    ", one would also severely underestimate the overall stellar mass of the system .",
    "we stress , however , that very few objects subject to very high obscuration have so far been identified at @xmath5  with lfls3 at @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 mag @xcite being the only compelling case so far . on the contrary ,",
    "both observations and simulations suggest that that the average obscuration is @xmath104 mag in all but the most luminous galaxies at @xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite discussed two separate mechanisms for lyc leakage  an ionization - bounded nebula with holes and a density - bounded nebula .",
    "in this paper , we have only considered the former one , since @xcite argue that the two should give rise to very similar signatures in the ew(h@xmath2)@xmath2 diagram .",
    "however , the relative strength of emission lines like [ oiii]5007 and [ oii]3727 ( which can both be readily observed with jwst / nirspec up to @xmath105 ) differ in the case of density - bounded nebulae , which means that jwst / nirspec observations should not only be able to constrain @xmath0 , but also provide the handle on the dominating mode of lyc escape mechanism from galaxies in the reionization epoch . observations of a galaxy with extreme lyc leakage at @xmath106 presented by @xcite and @xcite already support that the leakage is happening through a density - bounded nebula , and the properties of the interstellar medium of the @xmath1 galaxy studied in [ oii]88@xmath33 m and [ cii]158@xmath33 m by @xcite also appear favorable for lyc leakage through this mechanism . for this reason , it would be valuable to extend the present work to include density - bounded nebulae . while this extension is straightforward , it also involves more free parameters , since the oxygen lines are also sensitive to the ionization parameter and the relative oxygen abundance .",
    "we do , however , intend to revisit such models in a future paper .",
    "simulations suggest that lyc leakage may be highly anisotropic , so that even though the global @xmath0 may be significant , the parts of a galaxy that is facing the observer may exhibit very low lyc escape . if so , this would complicate the use of methods aiming to constrain @xmath0 using absorption lines , since these are measuring the covering fraction of foreground gas .",
    "one could for instance imagine a galaxy in which absorption lines suggest complete coverage and hence zero lyc leakage , whereas extremely high lyc leakage is taking place in the opposite direction .",
    "the same problem also plagues direct detections of lyc leakage from individual objects at @xmath107 , since these are biased by the lyc fraction that happens to be escaping in the direction of the observer .    as discussed in sections  [ sed_modelling ] and  [ dust ] , our method would be able to detect the signatures of lyc leakage even in the case of highly anisotropic escape , albeit with caveats . in the case of minor dust attenuation",
    ", anisotropic lyc leakage would not be a problem , since nebular emission from all sides of the galaxy should be able to reach the observer .",
    "hence , our method should provide a better handle of the _ global _ escape fraction of galaxies .",
    "however , scenarios involving high obscuration coupled to anisotropic leakage ( as discussed in section  [ high_obscuration ] ) would introduce a directional bias on the@xmath0 inferred by our method as well .",
    "the simulated seds presented in this paper are based on assumption that the imf is fully sampled , which is a safe approximation for high - mass stellar populations . for low - mass systems",
    ", however , the incomplete sampling of the imf may lead to stochastic variations between the ionizing and non - ionizing continuum fluxes , which would complicate attempts to estimate @xmath0 based on the equivalent width of emission lines from individual objects .",
    "imf sampling effects are negligible for objects with star formation rates sfr@xmath108 yr@xmath109 @xcite , which for our simulated galaxies at @xmath15 correspond to @xmath110 28.529.0 at rest - frame wavelengths around 1500  . in the absence of gravitational lensing ,",
    "jwst / nirspec is not likely to be able to push beyond this limit @xcite .",
    "however , a strongly lensed galaxy that appears at this limit could have sfr@xmath111 yr@xmath109 , at which point stochastic imf sampling effects would start to matter . at this point , the method proposed for estimating @xmath0 would become unreliable for individual objects .",
    "the typical @xmath0 in a population of galaxies could in principle still be inferred , but this requires that one takes the predicted distribution of observed properties as a function of @xmath0 into account , and corrects for the fact that the galaxies with the most massive stars are more easily detectable .      the method for constraining @xmath0 in this paper and in @xcite is based on notion that the lyc absorbed by gas within galaxies should be reflected in the strength of rest - frame uv / optical emission lines relative to the continuum at these wavelengths ( which stems both from direct starlight and free - bound / free - free processes in the interstellar medium ) . however , in simulations , the radial deliminator at which a lyc photon is considered to have reached the igm is traditionally placed at the dark halo virial radius , which means that the lyc photon not only needs to escape from the dense interstellar medium within galaxies , but also needs to make it past neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium , which may have much lower density .",
    "when the density drops below @xmath112 @xmath45 , the hydrogen recombination time scale becomes @xmath113 myr , which means that that the recombination flux per unit time will be much lower than in the denser interstellar medium , and that changes in the stellar lyc output will be reflected in the recombination emission lines with a substantial time delay .",
    "as an example of the potential problem that this could introduce , consider an extreme scenario in which a sudden surge of star formation boosts the lyc flux of a stellar population and produces a blue rest - frame stellar ultraviolet continuum , yet all lyc photons are absorbed in low - density , circumgalactic gas .",
    "this could result in a situation in which @xmath89 , yet the long recombination timescale ensures extremely weak emission lines , suggesting @xmath114 .",
    "simulations of the covering fraction and density of neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies at @xmath5 would be very useful to assess how serious this problem is likely to be .",
    "of course , since the problem is fundamentally due to a mismatch between what is measured in observations and simulations , the issue can be completely evaded by simply redefining the threshold radius at which lyc escape is assumed to have occurred in simulations to provide a better match between the two .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * as part of the lycan project , we have generated a large grid of synthetic sed of @xmath11579 galaxies drawn spectra from cosmological simulations , in a wavelength range relevant for jwst / nirspec observations at these redshifts .",
    "these models , which are intended for the planning of jwst observations and for training data analysis tools , include a number of different options concerning lyc leakage , stellar evolution , dust attenuation and observational noise , and are publicly available .",
    "* we demonstrate , that the method proposed by @xcite to constrain the lyc escape fraction of reionization - epoch galaxies from indirect spectral signatures ( emission lines and continuum ) in jwst / nirspec spectra seems to hold even in the light of variations in star formation history and metallicity at the level seen in the simulations .",
    "even very simple combinations of diagnostics like the slope of the uv continuum and the strength of the h@xmath2 emission line robustly allow the identification of extreme ( @xmath90 ) lyc - leaking galaxies ( section [ diagnostic_nodust ] ) .",
    "broadly speaking , such objects are expected to exhibit rest - frame ew(h@xmath2)@xmath116  . *",
    "uncertainties in dust attenuation , the effective attenuation law and in stellar evolution ( e.g. the role of binary evolution and stellar rotation ) at @xmath5 convert into systematic uncertainties in the @xmath0 inferred from individual galaxies , but upcoming observations at both low - to - intermediate redshifts and at @xmath5 should allow such model uncertainties to be severely constrained ( sections  [ diagnostic_nodust ] ,  [ dust ] and [ discussion ] ) .",
    "* potential complications that warrant further studies include direct lyc absorption by dust , density - bounded nebulae , and the absorption of lyc gas in low - density circumgalactic gas with very long recombination timescales ( section  [ discussion ] ) .",
