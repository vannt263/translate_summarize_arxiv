    "real systems manifesting critical behavior have necessarily finite volume .",
    "however it is well - known that the finiteness of the system size lets the critical singularities disappear and smears out the phase transition ( see for example [ 1 - 5 ] ) .",
    "the obvious argument which may reconcile these two aspects is that , as the finite size of the system is increased and passes through a critical value which characterizes the border of the thermodynamical domain , the thermodynamical limit is approximately reached and consequently the critical singularities manifest themselves .",
    "thus it is crucial to thoroughly understand the evolution of singularities with respect to the system size and estimate the critical size above which the thermodynamical limit is attained .",
    "an efficient tool to analyze the volume dependence of a critical phenomenon is the _ finite size scaling theory_. besides providing information on the rounding of critical singularities and the shift in the critical point , this theory is also an alternative way to determine critical exponents characterizing the phase transition .",
    "finite size scaling theory was developed by fisher and barber in the early seventies @xcite . during the last thirty years",
    "it has been applied to various systems exhibiting both first and second order phase transitions . among hundreds of subjects",
    "we can mention the study of finite size effects at first order transitions by gaussian approximation [ 7 - 8 ] , the gibbs ensemble @xcite , five dimensional ising model [ 10 - 11 ] , percolation models [ 12 - 13 ] , stochastic sandpiles @xcite , six - dimensional ising system @xcite , baxter - wu model @xcite , two dimensional anisotropic heisenberg model @xcite ...    in nature , the majority of phase transitions are sharp and discontinuous first order transitions .",
    "experimental uv absorption spectra of diluted dna solutions reveal that the dna melting transition belongs to this class .",
    "a widely used dynamical non - linear dna model was proposed twenty years ago by peyrard and bishop @xcite .",
    "this model involving harmonic interaction terms between successive base pairs was later improved by the contribution of dauxois @xcite and the new model ( dpb model ) yields a sharp transition .",
    "we recently proposed an alternative dna model ( jb model ) which respects the finiteness of the stacking energy , and showed that this model also exhibits a sharp first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "then in @xcite we showed that for both models the generalized homogeneity assumption is not respected so that josephson s identity ( also known as the hyperscaling relation ) is not valid .",
    "we tentatively explained this fact by the divergence of the order parameter at the critical point .",
    "the goal of this article is to investigate the sequence length dependence of the dna melting transition .",
    "this is an important point since experiments dealing with dna molecules are carried out with various sequence lengths . to this end",
    "we employ a modified transfer integral method adapted to finite chains with open boundary conditions .",
    "the two hamiltonian dna models to be studied , i.e. the dpb and the jb models , are briefly described in sec .",
    "ii . section iii deals with the transfer matrix theory for finite linear chains and sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the finite size scaling analysis which leads to a better understanding of finite size effects .",
    "the hamiltonians of the two dna models whose critical behaviour is studied in this article are of the form    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the transverse stretching of the hydrogen bond between the nth pair of bases , while the one - particle morse potential term    @xmath6    models the binding energy of the same hydrogen bond .",
    "the choice of the nearest - neighbor interaction potential @xmath7 is crucial since the type of the transition , which is a collective effect , depends primarily on its form .",
    "the dpb model @xcite assumes that the stacking energy is of the form    @xmath8\\hspace{0.5mm}.\\ ] ]    this non - linear stacking interaction has the particularity of having a coupling constant which drops from @xmath9 to @xmath10 as the critical point is approached .",
    "this decreases the rigidity of the dna chain close to the dissociation and yields a sharp , first - order transition .",
    "this interaction potential still has the inconvenience that the stacking energy diverges when two paired bases separate .",
    "taking into account the finiteness of the interaction between adjacent bases , we proposed a potential of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath11+k_b(y_n - y_{n-1})^2\\ ] ]    which , contrary to the model ( [ 0.2 ] ) , depends only on the distance between base pairs .",
    "the small harmonic term , whose constant @xmath12 is 2000 times smaller than the parameter @xmath10 of the dpb model , was introduced in order to take into account the stiffness of the phosphate - sugar backbone .",
    "numerical values of the parameters are those of refs .",
    "[ 19,20 ] , that is @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 for the dpb model , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the jb model .",
    "let us define the transfer integral ( ti ) kernel according to    @xmath23\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature . in the following analysis we deal only with sequences having open boundary conditions .",
    "then the partition function of the system can be expressed as    @xmath25    the ti method consists in expanding the kernel of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in an orthonormal basis    @xmath26    where the @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the integral operator and satisfy    @xmath29    this integral equation was solved by diagonalizing the symmetric ti operator @xmath30 on a regularly spaced grid defined between @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 intervals .",
    "numerical integrations were performed on the same grid .    in this study",
    "we extended the transfer matrix approach for open chains developed in @xcite to adapt it to the calculation of the order parameter @xmath1 and the correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "let us first consider extensive thermodynamic quantities . by introducing    @xmath34    and by substituting the kernel expansion of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into eq . ( [ 2 ] ) , we get    @xmath35    determination of the partition function then allows the computation of extensive quantities of the system such as the free energy , the entropy and the specific heat :    @xmath36    in the thermodynamical limit @xmath37 the major contribution to the partition function arises from the largest eigenvalue @xmath38 and in this limit it is reasonable to drop the eigenvalues with @xmath39 .",
    "neverthless , we will consider large dna molecules as well as small ones .",
    "consequently as many eigenvalues as possible must be taken into account in numerical computations . from the practical point of view",
    ", it was found that considering the first 400 eigenvalues is enough to insure numerical convergence of the results presented below .",
    "the order parameter of dna melting transition is the mean separation of the bases averaged over the sites of the sequence :    @xmath40    in order to reduce @xmath41 to a form depending only on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the ti operator , we first write it as    @xmath42    substituting eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) and defining    @xmath43    we obtain    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    for @xmath46 . by evaluating the geometric summation that appears in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) when replacing the @xmath41 by their expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ 13])-([14 ] ) , we finally get    @xmath47    with @xmath48 . the computation of the correlation length @xmath0 proceeds along similar lines although it is more elaborate .",
    "a sketch of the derivation and the analytical result can be found in appendix a.",
    "it is well known that a finite - size system does not exhibit any phase transition . at the critical point",
    "its free energy is analytic and consequently all thermodynamical quantities are regular .",
    "let @xmath2 be the size of a system having a critical behaviour in the thermodynamical limit @xmath49 . for this system finite - size effects manifest themselves as @xmath50 , where @xmath0 is the correlation length , by rounding the critical point singularity .",
    "in other words they become important over a region for which @xmath51 . a simple example of this rounding phenomena concerning the ising model",
    "can be found in @xcite . for an infinite - size ising system , as the magnetic field @xmath52 varies , the order parameter jumps discontinuously from @xmath53 to @xmath54 at the critical point @xmath55 . on the other hand",
    "if the system s size is finite , this transition occurs on a finite region of order @xmath56 with a large but finite slope @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the most probable value of the magnetization in the finite system .",
    "for the two dna models sketched in sect .",
    "2 , the size @xmath2 of the system is equal to the number @xmath59 of base pairs in the sequence times the distance between two successive base pairs .",
    "this latter quantity playing no role in the dynamics of the investigated models , we will henceforth use indistinctly @xmath59 or @xmath2 to refer to the size of the sequence .    given a sequence of length @xmath59 ,",
    "the first task consists in determining its critical temperature , which we denote by @xmath60 . among the several methods listed for example in @xcite , we found it rather simple and convenient to search for the maximum of the specific heat @xmath61 , which is more pronounced than that of the correlation length @xmath0 , thus allowing for a more accurate localization of the temperature .",
    "two observations confirm a posteriori that the critical temperatures thus obtained are correct .",
    "first , the shift in critical temperature is found to vary as a power of @xmath59 , as predicted by finite - size scaling theory ( see below ) .",
    "the top plot of fig .",
    "1 shows for example that @xmath62 , where @xmath63 stands for @xmath64 , varies as @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the dpb and jb models , respectively .",
    "note that this scaling is also in excellent agreement with the semi - empirical formula used by experimentalists to calculate the melting temperature of finite sequences .",
    "moreover , as will be seen later ( figs . 3 and 4 ) the curves for the temperature evolution of @xmath61 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc ... for sequences with different lengths @xmath59 all coincide sufficiently far from the critical temperature when plotted as a function of the reduced temperature    @xmath67 in order to illustrate finite - size effects acting on dna melting , we first computed the entropy per base , @xmath68 , for an infinite chain and a short dna sequence for both the dpb and the jb models .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "2 . at the thermodynamic limit , the entropy @xmath69 is clearly discontinuous at the critical temperature , as is expected for first order phase transitions .",
    "in contrast , smooth curves are observed over the whole temperature range for the sequence with @xmath70 .",
    "we next computed the specific heat per base , @xmath71 , for increasing sequence length and temperature .",
    "the top and bottom plots of fig .",
    "3 show the temperature evolution of @xmath72 for seven values of @xmath59 ranging from 100 to infinity for the dpb and jb models , respectively .",
    "it is seen in this figure that rounding manifests itself through a decrease in the maximum of @xmath72 as @xmath59 decreases , but also through the fact that the sharp rise of @xmath72 takes place further and further from the critical temperature , that is , at increasingly larger values of @xmath73 .",
    "this is particularly clear for the dpb model , which at the thermodynamic limit undergoes a very sharp transition , i.e. a transition that is noticeable only at very small values of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly , examination of fig .",
    "3 also indicates that the two models consequently give very comparable results up to @xmath75 , while the narrower nature of the phase transition for the dpb model becomes apparent for longer sequences .    at this point",
    ", it should be emphasized that boundary effects may become important when the size of the system is small .",
    "in order to check whether such boundary effects play a role in the results presented above , we repeated these computations with periodic boundary conditions instead of open ones and found that this alters only very little the results for @xmath69 and @xmath72 down to @xmath70 .",
    "conclusion is therefore that boundary effects play only a marginal role down to this size .    finally , we computed , for the jb model , the temperature evolution of the correlation length @xmath0 ( eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) ) and the order parameter @xmath1 ( eq . ( [ 15 ] ) ) for increasing values of @xmath59 .",
    "as the critical temperature is approached , the correlation length @xmath0 of a finite - size system is expected to increase according to the power law @xmath76 till it reaches the system s dimension @xmath2 and freezes .",
    "this behaviour can be checked in the middle plot of fig .",
    "1 , which shows the evolution of the maximum of the correlation length ( in units of the separation between successive base pairs ) as a function of @xmath59 : the maximum of @xmath0 is indeed of the same order of magnitude as @xmath59 and the curve scales as @xmath77 .",
    "an exception however occurs for the last three points with @xmath78 : we will come back later to this point .",
    "the bottom plot of fig .",
    "4 additionally shows the temperature evolution of @xmath0 for seven values of @xmath59 ranging from 100 to infinity .",
    "one observes just the same rounding effects as for the specific heat in fig .",
    "this is again the case for the temperature evolution of the order parameter @xmath1 , which is drawn in the top plot of fig .",
    "this latter plot however displays a remarkable feature , in the sense that all the curves converge to the same limit at @xmath60 . to understand why this is the case , it must be realized that @xmath1 , the average separation between paired bases , is the only quantity which diverges at the critical temperature whatever the size @xmath59 of the sequence , while , for example , @xmath72 and @xmath0 diverge for infinitely long chains but remain finite for finite chains .",
    "the limit towards which all curves converge in the top plot of fig .",
    "4 is thus just the approximation of infinity imposed by the numerical procedure ( size of the grid , etc ... ) .",
    "the basic idea of finite - size scaling is that the correlation length @xmath0 is the only length that matters close to the critical temperature and that one just needs to compare the linear dimension @xmath2 of the system to @xmath0 : rounding and shifting indeed set in as soon as @xmath79 .",
    "since , by definition of the critical exponent @xmath80 , @xmath0 grows as @xmath81 , one has @xmath82 as @xmath83 or , @xmath2 being proportional to the number @xmath59 of paired bases , @xmath84 . in the absence of external field , it is therefore natural to write the singular part of the free energy of the finite - size system in the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is some homogeneous function . differentiating eq .",
    "( [ 15.1 ] ) twice with respect to @xmath87 , one obtains that @xmath72 is equal to @xmath88 where    @xmath89    and @xmath90 is an homogeneous function which is proportional to the second derivative of @xmath86 . by using josephson s identity , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the critical exponent for @xmath72 ( @xmath93 , coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be recast in the form    @xmath96    conversely , if there occur several lengths that diverge at the critical point , as is the case for dna melting , then it is no longer so clear to which of these lengths @xmath2 should be compared .",
    "in order to tackle this more complex case , binder et al @xcite derived a method which is based on the use of an irrelevant variable @xmath97 and an expression of the form    @xmath98    after several approximations and a little bit of algebra , these authors obtain @xmath72 in the form of eq .",
    "( [ 15.2 ] ) with , however ,    @xmath99    finally , the lengths that diverge at dna melting are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the average separation between paired bases",
    ". one might wonder whether @xmath2 should not be compared to @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 . in order to check this hypothesis ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath100 the characteristic exponent for @xmath1 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "remember that if the external field is proportional to @xmath102 then @xmath1 is the order parameter @xmath103 , so that @xmath100 is equal to @xmath104 , the critical exponent for @xmath103 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "let us next express the singular part of the free energy in the form    @xmath106    differentiating eq .",
    "( [ 15.7 ] ) twice with respect to @xmath87 , one again obtains @xmath72 in the form of eq .",
    "( [ 15.2 ] ) with , however    @xmath107    table i shows the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 calculated from the characteristic exponents reported in @xcite and eqs ( [ 15.3 ] ) , ( [ 15.4 ] ) , ( [ 15.6 ] ) and ( [ 15.8 ] ) , as well as adjusted values .",
    "these latter ones were obtained by varying @xmath94 and @xmath95 by hand in order that the plots of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath109 are superposed for an interval of values of @xmath59 as large as possible . by setting @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ 15.2 ] ) , one sees that the maximum of @xmath72 scales as @xmath111 .",

    "1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath95 was adjusted in the neighbourhood of @xmath112 .",
    "examination of table i indicates that the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 obtained from eqs .",

    "( [ 15.4 ] ) ( top plots ) and adjusted ones ( bottom plots ) .",
    "it is seen in the top plots that the curves with different values of @xmath59 are far from being superposed for the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 15.4 ] ) , and the situation is still worse with eq .",
    "( [ 15.6 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the various curves are fairly well superposed for the adjusted values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see bottom plots of figs 5 and 6 ) , as well as those obtained with eqs .",
    "( [ 15.3 ] ) and ( [ 15.8 ] ) .",
    "an exception occurs for the curves corresponding to the largest values of @xmath59 in the jb model ( bottom plot of fig .",
    "remember that the corresponding points also depart from the power law in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "the reason for this is that the ti method fails to give correct values of thermodynamical observables too close to the phase transition discontinuity .",
    "examination of the top plots of fig .",
    "3 shows that sequences of length @xmath113 are still rather far from the thermodynamic limit for the dpb model , so that one needs not to worry about the effect of the discontinuity on ti calculations .",
    "in contrast , the bottom plot of fig . 3 and the two plots of fig .",
    "4 indicate that sequences of length @xmath113 have reached the thermodynamic limit for the jb model , so that the perturbative effect of the discontinuity becomes noticeable in ti calculations .",
    "the fact that eq . ( [ 15.3 ] ) leads to a correct superposition of the curves for different values of the sequence length @xmath59 is the proof that the basic hypothesis of finite - size scaling theory is satisfied . since , however , eq .

(",
    "[ 15.4 ] ) is used to calculate @xmath94 and @xmath95 simply reflects the fact that josephson s identity , @xmath91 , is not valid for these two models of dna melting , a conclusion which was already arrived at in our preceding work @xcite . finally , the fact that curves also do not superpose when eq .",

    "( [ 15.4 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we modified the transfer integral method to adapt it to the calculation of thermodynamic quantities of finite sequences with open boundary conditions . non - extensive quantities , like the average separation of paired bases @xmath1 and the correlation length @xmath0 , turned out to be the most tricky ones to evaluate .",
    "we then applied this modified procedure to the dpb and jb dynamical models , in order to clarify how the finiteness of the length of the sequence affects the phase transition that takes place at dna melting temperature .",
    "we showed that the rounding of the transition that occurs when the size of the sequence decreases is clearly reflected in the temperature evolution of most quantities , including the specific heat @xmath72 , the correlation length @xmath0 , and the average separation of paired bases @xmath1 .",
    "we next performed a finite - size scaling analysis of the two systems and showed that the singular part of the free energy can indeed be expressed in terms of an homogeneous function .",
    "however , since both @xmath0 and @xmath1 diverge at the melting transition , it is no longer clear whether the argument of the homogeneous function should be ( a power of ) @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , josephson s identity is satisfied for none of the investigated systems , so that the derivation of the characteristic exponents @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which appear in the asymptotic expression of the specific heat @xmath72 , requires some care .",
    "the transfer integral ( ti ) method appears as the only efficient numerical tool to study the thermodynamics of dna melting in detail . in the formulation",
    "used here , it however applies only to homogeneous chains , while it is well established that the heterogeneity of real dna molecules may smear out the discontinuity of the melting transition , just like the finiteness of the sequence does .",

    "<S> we investigated how the finiteness of the length of the sequence affects the phase transition that takes place at dna melting temperature . </S>",

    "<S> we showed that rounding of the transition clearly takes place when the length of the sequence is decreased . </S>",
