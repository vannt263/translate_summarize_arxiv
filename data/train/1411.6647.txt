    "we claim that then there is a finite , @xmath3-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath4 , as well as a continuous map @xmath5 with the following property : whenever @xmath6 is an embedded incompressible loop in @xmath1 ( meaning that the fundamental group of @xmath7 injects into the fundamental group of @xmath1 ) , then @xmath7 intersects the image of every continuous map @xmath8 that is homotopic to @xmath9 .    in the case",
    "in which @xmath1 is a @xmath0-torus , this statement follows in an elementary way : we can choose @xmath4 to be the disjoint union of three @xmath3-tori and @xmath5 to be an embedding that maps those @xmath3-tori to @xmath3-tori that generate the second homology of @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that every homotope of @xmath9 intersects every non - contractible loop of @xmath1 can then be seen by a standard intersection number argument .    for the purposes of @xcite , we will however need a somewhat stronger statement , which as it turns out , is far more difficult to prove .",
