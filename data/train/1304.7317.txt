    "the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are observed to be fainter than expected from the luminosity - redshift relationship in a decelerating universe .",
    "this unanticipated dimming was first attributed to an accelerating expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "although the existence of cosmic acceleration has been verified by several other observations , initially , there had been some debates on the interpretation of underlying physical mechanism for the observed sne ia dimming .",
    "for example , dust in the milk way and oscillation of photons propagating in extragalactic magnetic fields into very light axions had been proposed to account for the dimming  @xcite .",
    "any kind of photon number violation , such as absorption , scattering or axion - photon mixing , sensibly imprints its influence on the tolman test  @xcite , which can be rewritten as a relationship among cosmological distance measurements known as the famous distance - duality ( dd ) relation  @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the redshift , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance ( add ) respectively .",
    "this reciprocity relation holds for general metric theories of gravity in any background , not just in that of the friedmann - lem@xmath10itre - robertson - walker background , and it is also valid for all cosmological models based on the riemannian geometry .",
    "that is , its validity depends neither on einstein field equations nor on the nature of the matter - energy content .",
    "the dd relation plays an important role in modern cosmology  @xcite , and , in most cases , it has been applied , without any doubt , to analyze the cosmological observations .",
    "however , the reciprocity relation may be violated if photons do not travel on null geodesics or the universe is opaque .",
    "fortunately , it is in principle possible to perform a valid check on the dd relation by means of astronomical observations .",
    "the basic idea is to search for observational candidates with known intrinsic luminosities as well as intrinsic sizes , and then determine their @xmath0 and @xmath1 to test the etherington relation directly .",
    "it is difficult for us to find objects of the same class with both known intrinsic luminosities and intrinsic sizes .",
    "thus , a @xmath6cdm cosmological model is usually assumed when one performs tests by utilizing observed @xmath0 or @xmath1  @xcite and the results show that there is no strong evidence for deviations from the standard dd relation .",
    "recently , a model - independent method has been proposed to test dd relation by considering two different classes of objects , for example , sne ia and galaxy clusters , from which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are determined separately  @xcite . for a given add data , in order to obtain the corresponding @xmath0 from sne ia , a selection criteria @xmath11 is adopted . using the phenomenological parameterized forms @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the data from union2 sn ia  @xcite and galaxy clusters , it was found that the dd relation can be accommodated at @xmath15 c. l. for the elliptical @xmath5 model  @xcite and at @xmath16 c. l. for the spherical @xmath5 model  @xcite .",
    "more recently , in order to avoid the bias from the redshift difference between @xmath0 and add , methods , such as , the binning of sne ia  @xcite , the interpolation  @xcite and local regression  @xcite from nearby sne ia points for a given galaxy cluster , were proposed and similar results were obtained . in addition , the dd relation tests by use of sne ia and gas mass function of galaxy clusters were carried out and similar results were also obtained  @xcite .",
    "so , overall , all the tests performed so far show that there is no strong indication of the dd relation violation . however , let us note that systematic uncertainties resulting from the morphological models of galaxy clusters and the redshift difference between @xmath0 and add might exert influences on dd relation tests .",
    "if one considers that the photon traveling along null geodesic is unassailable , the dd relation violation most likely implies non - conservation of the photon number which has a mundane origin ( scattering from dust or free electron ) or an exotic origin ( photon decay or photon mixing with other light states such as the dark energy , dilaton or axion  @xcite ) . in this case , the flux received by the observer will be reduced and so the universe is opaque .",
    "if we assume that the flux from the source is decreased by a factor @xmath17 , then the inferred ( observed ) luminosity distance differs from the  true \" one  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the opacity parameter which denotes the optical depth associated to the cosmic absorption .",
    "initially , more _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the cosmic opacity by examining the difference of the opacity parameter at redshifts @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the difference of the observational luminosity distance ( @xmath23 ) at these two redshifts was estimated from two subsamples of essence sn ia  @xcite and the corresponding @xmath24 was derived from the distance measurements of baryonic acoustic feature  @xcite in the context of @xmath6cdm . assuming flat priors on @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the range of @xmath27 , and uniformly spaced values of @xmath28",
    "$ ] , they found that a transparent universe is favored ( posterior probabilities of @xmath29 peaked at 0 ) and @xmath30 at 95% c. l .. this method has been applied to investigate the homogeneity of the cosmic opacity in different redshift regions and the results suggest that the cosmic opacity oscillates between zero and non - zero values as redshift varies  @xcite .",
    "later , avgoustidis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out further studies by assuming an optical depth parameterization @xmath2 or @xmath3 for small @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there they took the standard luminosity distance in the spatially flat @xmath6cdm ( @xmath33 ) and the union sn ia  @xcite for @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "in addition to the sne ia data , they also used the measurements of the cosmic expansion @xmath36  @xcite . by taking @xmath37 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ]  @xcite all uniformly spaced over the relevant intervals in a flat @xmath6cdm model and performing a full bayesian likelihood analysis , they obtained a result @xmath40 ( @xmath41 c. l. ) , which corresponds to an opacity @xmath42 ( 95% c. l. ) for the redshift range between 0.2 and 0.35 , almost a factor of 11 stronger than the constraint obtained in ref .",
    "recently , lima _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reexamined this issue by confronting the luminosity distance which is dependent on two free parameters , i.e. , the so called cosmic absorption parameter ( @xmath43 ) and the matter density ( @xmath26 ) , with observations , using a subsample of union2 sn ia obtained by selecting sne ia with redshifts greater than @xmath44 in order to avoid effects from hubble bubble , and they found that the einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath45 ) could be allowed at 68.3% ( 95.4% ) c. l. in the case of a constant ( epoch - dependent ) absorption and concluded that a cosmic absorption may be responsible for the dimming of the distant sne ia without the need of an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "however , all these studies concerning the cosmic opacity assume a ( flat ) @xmath6cdm model , and are thus model - dependent .    here",
    "we propose another model - independent method to examine the cosmic opacity and investigate its possible implications for the cosmic evolution .",
    "if we assume that the violation of the dd relation is purely caused by the photon number non - conservation , then we can find out whether the universe is opaque by checking the possible violation of the dd relation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the cosmic absorption not only affects the luminosity distance measurements of sne ia observations as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , but also exerts influences on the angular diameter distance measurements determined from sze+x - ray surface brightness observations  @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the temperature change due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons pass through the hot intracluster medium and @xmath48 is the x - ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters .",
    "the sze spectra distortion of the cmb is determined by measuring the intensity decrements , @xmath49 , which is sensitive to the cosmic absorption .",
    "additionally , the surveys of x - ray surface brightness are also sensitive to the opacity of the universe",
    ". supposing the absorption is frequency independent in the observed frequency range ( from microwave band to x - ray band ) , the  true \" add connects the observed one measured in an opaque universe with @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in actual calculations , the dd relation takes the following form : @xmath51 now we will use the the largest union2.1 sn ia sample  @xcite and the add data from galaxy cluster samples  @xcite to test , model - independently , the possible violation of the dd relation , which can be translated to a possible cosmic opacity .",
    "the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 come from the latest union2.1 sn ia and galaxy clusters samples  @xcite , respectively .",
    "actually , there are a number of inherent uncertainties in the selected astrophysical objects from which the observed @xmath1 are derived , e. g. , the cluster asphericity  @xcite and the model for the cluster gas distribution  @xcite . in this paper , we consider the elliptical @xmath5 model galaxy clusters sample  @xcite , spherical @xmath5 model , @xmath52-cut spherical @xmath5 model and hydrostatic equilibrium model galaxy clusters samples  @xcite to investigate the impact of these inherent uncertainties on the cosmic opacity test .",
    "in order to place constraints on the cosmic opacity parameter @xmath19 , we first parameterize it with two monotonically increasing functions of redshift , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these two parameterizations are basically similar for @xmath53 but they differ when @xmath9 is not very small . as the data applied in our following analysis discretely distribute in the redshift range @xmath54 , our analysis we are going to perform",
    "may tell us something about the possible dependence of the test results on the parametric forms for @xmath19 . to obtain @xmath55 determined by the following expression : @xmath56,\\ ] ] the data pairs of observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 almost at the same redshift should be supplied . for the observed @xmath0 , the largest union2.1 sn ia is considered .",
    "galaxy cluster samples , where the @xmath1 are obtained by combining the sze+x - ray surface brightness measurements  @xcite , are responsible for providing the observed @xmath1 . the first one , including a selection of 7 clusters compiled by mason _ et al .",
    "@xcite and a sample of 18 clusters collected by reese _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , was re - analyzed by filippis _",
    "_  @xcite by assuming an elliptical @xmath5 model for the galaxy clusters .",
    "the second kind of samples are compiled by bonamente _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with three different models for the cluster plasma and dark matter distribution , i.e. , the spherical @xmath5 model , spherical @xmath5 model with @xmath57 kpc cut , and hydrostatic equilibrium model .",
    "therefore , the data derived from these three different models are adopted to check whether the cosmic opacity tests are sensitive to the model for the cluster gas distribution .",
    "the observed @xmath0 are binned from the data points of union2.1 sn ia with their redshifts satisfying the certain criteria ( @xmath58 ) to match the observational data of the add samples  @xcite .",
    "this binning method can minimize the statistical errors originating from the redshift difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , we alter @xmath59 from 0.000 to 0.005 to ensure the number of the clusters that share the same sne to be as few as possible , so as to reduce the dependence of opacity tests on the correlation of redshift - matched sne . after obtaining @xmath55 from these selected data pairs",
    ", we estimate the free parameters of a given parametric form by using the standard minimum @xmath60 route : @xmath61 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_{\\tau_{\\mathrm{obs}}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the error of @xmath63 associated with the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and @xmath64 represents the free parameters to be constrained .",
    "the graphic representations and numerical results of the probability distribution of the opacity parameter @xmath31 constrained from the model - independent tests are shown in figures  ( [ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] ) and table  ( [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "these suggest that the dependence of test results on the above - chosen parameterizations for @xmath65 is relatively weak .",
    "similar to the results obtained by examining the cosmic opacity in a particular redshift range ( 0.20 - 0.35 )  @xcite and deforming the dd relation in terms of the cosmic absorption parameter  @xcite , we find , from figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , that an almost transparent universe is also favored by the elliptical @xmath5 model galaxy clusters sample  @xcite . for the add samples given by bonamente _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we find that the results are nearly not sensitive to the model of cluster gas distribution and a transparent universe can only be marginally accommodated at 95.4% c. l. ( even at 99.7% c. l. when the @xmath57 kpc - cut spherical @xmath5 model is considered ) .",
    "that is , all the constraints on the opacity parameter obtained from the bonamente _",
    "_ samples prefer an opaque universe .",
    "these results are clearly different from what were obtained based on the @xmath6cdm in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a transparent universe is obviously supported .",
    "in fact , these cosmic opacity test results are very similar to the previous model - independent tests for the dd relation  @xcite .",
    "however , our objective here is the cosmic opacity test with an assumption that the violation of the dd relation entirely originates from the non - conservation of photon number , rather than the dd relation test itself .    in order to explore the implications of the cosmic opacity ,",
    "let us transform the sne ia distance modulus in a transparent universe into that in an opaque one @xmath66\\tau(z)\\;,\\ ] ] and study the cosmological constraints resulting from this correction .",
    "since the high redshift galaxy cluster data are absent in our discussion of the cosmic opacity , the distance - modulus - modified sne ia used to investigate the cosmological constraints are cut down from union2.1 with the criteria @xmath67 and @xmath68 when clusters in the filippis _",
    "_ sample and the bonamente _",
    "_ samples are applied , respectively .",
    "since the dependence of cosmic opacity tests on the above - chosen parametric forms of @xmath65 is relatively weak , we only consider results obtained from the linear parametrization ( @xmath2 ) in the following cosmological implication analysis .",
    "for the flat @xmath6cdm model , different from the methods used in refs .",
    "@xcite , we examine the probability distributions of @xmath26 by considering the possible ( 68.3% c. l. range ) opacity parameter @xmath31 constrained from the previous model - independent tests .",
    "the results are shown in figures  ( [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we find that the opacity parameter @xmath31 constrained from previous cosmological - model - independent tests impact slightly on the likelihood distributions of @xmath26 and a universe with @xmath69 is required to account for the dimming of the sne ia .",
    "this differs from the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath45 ) can be easily accommodated at 68.3% and 95.4% c. l. for the constant and epoch - dependent absorptions , respectively .    without a spatially flat universe",
    "prior , we also investigate the @xmath6cdm with the corrected distance modulus of union2.1 sn ia by taking the opacity parameter @xmath31 in 68.3% c. l. range constrained from the previous model - independent tests into consideration .",
    "the linear parametrization for the cosmic opacity is also considered .",
    "the results projecting to the @xmath70 plane are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . because of the  marginalization \" of @xmath31 , which somewhat weakens the constraints on parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 , the statement that the expansion of universe is accelerating is less eloquent than the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , which concludes that a currently accelerating universe is needed at 99.9% ( 3.9@xmath71 ) c. l. to agree with their distance measurements of sne ia . however , we find that a decelerating universe with @xmath7 is only allowed at @xmath72 c. l. by observations when the spherical @xmath5 model is taken into account .",
    "so , the standard cosmological scenario is still supported by observations , although current data may favor a universe with non - zero opacity ,",
    "in this paper , by considering the luminosity distances provided by the largest union2.1 sn ia sample together with the add given by galaxy clusters samples , we first examine the possible cosmic opacity in a cosmological - model - independent way .",
    "two redshift - dependent parametric expressions : @xmath2 and @xmath3 are considered to describe the optical depth associated to the cosmic absorption .",
    "the results suggest that the tests of cosmic opacity are not significantly sensitive to the parametrization for @xmath65 . for the add sample compiled by filippis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite with an elliptical @xmath5 model , we obtain that a universe with little opacity ( almost transparent ) is favored . for the add samples given by bonamente _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where three different cluster gas distribution models are applied , the test results suggest that a transparent universe can only be marginally consistent with observations at 95.4% c. l. ( even at 99.7% c. l. as the @xmath57 kpc - cut spherical @xmath5 model is applied ) .",
    "these are fairly different from the conclusions in refs .",
    "@xcite . by considering the possible cosmic opacity ( 68.3% c. l. range ) constrained from the previous model - independent tests , we obtain the corrected distance modulus of sne ia and then use them to investigate its cosmological implications . in the context of a flat @xmath6cdm ,",
    "the likelihood functions of @xmath26 are examined .",
    "the results are shown in figures  ( [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we find that the opacity parameter @xmath31 constrained from previous cosmological - model - independent tests have slight influences on the probability distributions of @xmath26 and a universe with @xmath69 is required to account for the dimming of the sne ia .",
    "discarding the condition of the spatial flatness , we display the corresponding plots in the @xmath70 plane in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we find that a decelerating expanding universe with @xmath7 is only accommodated by observations at @xmath73 c. l. when the spherical @xmath5 model is considered .",
    "that is , a positive cosmological constant is still needed to account for the dimming of sne ia and the standard cosmological scenario remains being supported by current observations .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that , the presence of systematic uncertainties in observations , especially add measurements using sze+x - ray surface brightness observations , and the assumption of the frequency independency of absorption in the observed frequency range in our analysis might result in some biases of our test results .",
    "moreover , as for the dd relation test , the morphological models of galaxy cluster may also exert a remarkable influence on the tests for cosmic opacity .",
    "in fact , any conclusion that current data may favor a non - zero opacity should be backed up with a thorough analysis of these systematics .",
    "therefore , we may expect more vigorous and convincing constraints on the cosmic opacity within the coming years with more precise data , especially the add data , and a deeper understanding for the absorption in various wavelength bands and the intrinsic three dimensional shape of clusters of galaxies .",
