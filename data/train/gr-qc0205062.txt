    "one of the best promising methods of searching for a planetary systems around nearby stars is the high accuracy astrometric observations .",
    "sim is being designed to produce wealth of the astrometric data necessary to address exactly this problem .",
    "it is clear that the corresponding astrometric signal due to a reflex motion of a target star will be at the level of a few @xmath1as and smaller .",
    "the most successful searching techniques will have to incorporate an intelligent way of data processing almost at the astrometric noise level .",
    "another important part of this puzzle is development of the astrometric model for the instrument .",
    "this model should include all the parameters necessary to account for different phenomena affecting the light propagation , and are due to the interstellar media , the solar system dynamics , as well as due to the motion of the free - flying interferometer itself . as a result",
    ", the accuracy of astrometric observations expected with sim , will require a number of dynamical parameters to be precisely known . to do this",
    ", one will have to be able to remove ( or to correctly account for ) the signatures of all the known effects in order to study the unknown phenomena .",
    "this is necessary for minimizing probability of a false detections caused , for example , by aliasing the dynamics of objects in the solar system .",
    "actually , there will be a number of parameters introduced by the dynamics in the solar system with periods of the order of a few years .",
    "one of such a parameters is the three - dimensional vector of barycentric velocity of the spacecraft .",
    "thus , a future astrometric model will have to account not only for the effects due to the motion of the solar system bodies , but also for those that are generated by the motion of the spacecraft and corresponding errors in the spacecraft s navigation .",
    "in this paper we will discuss some important elements of dynamical model for the future astrometric observations with sim .",
    "specifically , we will address the issue of the relativistic stellar aberration .",
    "the stellar aberration is a very important problem for sim .",
    "effect of the barycentric velocity of the spacecraft is the largest term in the sim astrometric model and will amounts to @xmath2 arcsec for the earth - trailing orbit .",
    "this effect is important not only for a wide angle astrometric observations , but it will produce a measurable effect for a pairs of widely separated stars even inside the tile ( with diameter @xmath3 ) . additionally , a possible correlation of the astrometric observables with the errors in the spacecraft s velocity sky - angles suggests that in order to achieve the mission accuracy for a global astrometric observations of @xmath4as , one will have to control the barycentric velocity of the spacecraft throughout the entire mission and account for the relativistic stellar aberration inside every single tile .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we will present a simplified model for differential astrometric observations with a free - flying interferometer with a single baseline . we will discuss a model for absolute and differential astrometric measurements and will give a three - dimensional parameterization of main observables .",
    "we will present the first order differentials , necessary to analyze the errors propagation . in section [ sec : tile ]",
    "we will discuss orientation of the tile in the sim nominal observing direction .",
    "we will present the first order equations that are governing the propagation of astrometric errors in the instrument . specifically",
    ", we address the velocity knowledge requirement , the data sampling rate and orbital position knowledge , and the spacecraft acceleration accuracy constraint . in section",
    "[ sec : req ] we will derive the set of the relativistic stellar aberration requirements for sim . we will conclude by presenting our recommendations for future attitude control for the sim spacecraft . in order to make access of the basic results of this paper easier , we will present some important ( but lengthy ! ) calculations in the appendices .",

    ", we will present estimates of the optical path difference ( opd ) for a single - baseline interferometer in solar orbit",
    ". our derivations will be different from the ones obtained earlier by the fact that for each tile we account for effects of general three - dimensional motion of the interferometer , for the errors in the components of the baseline vector @xmath5 , and for the error in estimating the instrumental offset ( or , calibration ) term , @xmath6 .",
    "our model is very simple , but it could be easily expanded to accommodate a number of other important features of the instrument .",
    "we address the problem of relativistic stellar aberration from a general standpoint .",
    "a `` toy '' astrometric model developed here will include only the largest relativistic contributions due to the orbital motion of the interferometer around the sun .",
    "a complete , fully - relativistic model for the sim observations , will have to account for a number of physical phenomena and should include a set of additional terms ( and corresponding parameters ) necessary for different astrometric applications .",
    "more specifically , the future model should include the terms @xmath7 to account for higher orders of relativistic stellar aberration ; terms @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the gravity constant and @xmath10 is the mass of the deflecting body ) to account for the gravitational deflection by the bodies of the solar system ( primarily the sun and the jupiter ) .",
    "( for general discussion of the general relativistic effects in the sim asdtrometric observations , see @xcite ) one also will need to account for rigid - body rotational motion of the spacecraft , etc .",
    "all these effects , together with a number of others , are out of the scope of the present paper , but will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "while the derivation of the general expressions will be given in the reminder of the document , here we will present only the main results obtained .",
    "let us begin by deriving the expression for opd @xmath11 for an interferometer with a single baseline @xmath12 which is moving with the velocity @xmath13 ( for sim this ratio will of of the order @xmath14 ) with respect to some reference frame ( rf ) , for example the solar - system barycentric ( ssb ) reference frame . in the interferometer s proper quasi - inertial reference frame opd , @xmath15 ,",

    "the same quantity may be presented in the coordinates of the ssb reference frame .",
    "the corresponding transformation between the solar system barycentric frame and the one of the moving interferometer ( with velocity @xmath19 with respect to ssb ) will necessarily account for the effect of the relativistic stellar aberration ( for more details see @xcite ) . to the first order in @xmath20 , the aberrated direction to the source and the baseline vector",
    "may be expressed as follows : @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath12 are the direction to the observed source and the baseline vector as measured in ssb .",
    "the total effect of this transformation has the form @xmath23 where we have assumed that the instrument offset does not depend on the velocity of the spacecraft motion to the second order in @xmath20 , or , in more general terms , @xmath24 .",
    "this issue may be correctly addressed later when the accurate model of the instrument will be developed .",

    "however , the wide - angle astrometric campaign with sim will be based on a set of differential ( or relative ) astrometric observations made inside a set of 637 tiles covering the whole sky ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", it will measure to a certain accuracy the angular distances between a pairs of stars in the same field of view .",
    "this necessitates the derivation of an expression for the optical path difference , similar to eq.([eqdel12 ] ) , which would take this fact into account . to the first order in @xmath20 this is a fairly easy task . assuming that absolute position for each star is given by expression , similar to that of eq.([eqdel10 ] ) , namely : @xmath26    one could write the corresponding differential ( or relative ) opd for a differential astrometric observations . to describe differential measurements",

    "in particular , we will analyze the constraints that should be placed on different error budget constituents in the cases when one choose to make the assumptions based on either single measurement accuracy or the expected wide - angle mission accuracy .",
    "it is important to point out that the velocity aberration issue has two flavors to it , in a sense that it is influencing both the narrow angle observations and ( by the procedure of the astrometric grid reduction ) the wide angle ones .",

    "] this example suggests that a possible correlation between the velocity components and the constant term in the narrow - angle observations may put an additional demand on the quality of the dsn data .",
    "thus for the worst case scenario , dsn will have to deliver data for all three components of the velocity vector with considerably smaller errors , say @xmath131    the two numbers above are the very pessimistic estimates for the required accuracy of determination the spacecraft velocity vector and are given for the worst case of highly correlated data .",

    "one can see that relativistic stellar aberration increases roughly as the tile angle squared .",

    "we will estimate the influence of a temporal changes introduced by the rotational motion of the interferometer with respect to it s center of mass .",
    "thus , the expression ( [ eq : simmain54 ] ) may be used to derive another requirement , namely the requirement on the knowledge of the rotational motion of the spacecraft , or on - board attitude control .",
    "a simple - minded calculation assumes that , for example , the angle @xmath102 is changing with time as    @xmath140    where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the constant rate of this angular change and constant angular acceleration ( a similar analysis could be made for the angle @xmath103 ) . assuming that for any given time the quantity @xmath143 has a normal gaussian distribution with errors obeying the equation : @xmath144 the later expression may be taken as an input to derive the on - board attitude requirements .",

    "we have demonstrated that the 4 mm / s requirement for the relativistic stellar aberration is quite well justified for the sim related studies .",
    "however , a secondary effects , such as possible correlation between the constant term and the instantaneous spacecraft velocity vector may produce a noticeable impact on the astrometric observations .",
    "thus , account for this possible correlation , actually results in tightening the velocity requirement ( for the worst case of highly correlated data ) and almost twice minimizes a tolerable error in the velocity estimates , notably @xmath137 mm / s .",
    "additionally , the solar radiation pressure will greatly influence the sim orbital solution and will be the major force acting on the spacecraft . as a result the navigation dsn time will not go down as the mission progresses because of fluctuations in the solar radiation pressure .",

    "the development of a better model for the instrument in order to perform analysis of its ` elastic'/dynamical properties and the systematics hidden in the `` constant '' term will significantly boost the related studies .",
    "another issue that needed to be discussed is the reducing the velocity accuracy requirement down to 2 mm / s . a first look at this problem",
    "brings a conclusion is that this is not an easy problem for sim in deep space ( for more details , please see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , some of the issues concerning sim in a sirtf - like orbit , with a 2mm / s velocity knowledge requirement are leading to the following conclusions from the dsn tracking stand - point :    \\1 . by utilizing the doppler range - rate method one can achieve more than adequate precision in the radial direction , of order 0.05 mm /",
    "s is reasonable .",
    "but in the plane of the sky , it is more difficult : long observations ( doppler arcs ) are necessary and it is unclear that the same precision can be obtained uniformly in any case  it will likely be a function of the ecliptic latitude of sim at the time of observation .",
    "\\2 . by using the delta - dor observations ( vlbi ) with a single baseline and x / s - band observations ,",
    "one may be able to obtain a precision of at best @xmath155 1 nrad for a fairly short observation ( tens of minutes , including qso calibrator ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath155 15 m at 0.1  au .",
    "so , a pair of observations separated by @xmath155 2 hr or , so could get one plane - of - sky component to the required accuracy ; ideally a track would be used to improve the snr and get somewhat better accuracy perpendicular to the baseline . to get both plane of sky components",
    "a pair of baselines is necessary [ a bigger dsn commitment , of course ] .",
    "it is unclear whether the radial doppler range - rate will be available with the same antennas at the same time as the vlbi observations .",
    "development of a ka band capability would improve the precision by a factor of @xmath155 3 .",
    "this is why meeting the sim requirements is not completely trivial .",
    "it might improve if the distance is not as far , and it would be interesting to see how performance varied with a number of parameters , including declination .",
    "there is another issue which was raised in this paper .",
    "that is a reasonable definition for the data sampling rate @xmath42 necessary to use in order to introduce an on - board correction for the relativistic aberration .",
    "our results show that the answer to this question may impact the whole mission operations approach .",
    "this is why we believe that this issue should be a topic for a separate study and the corresponding results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "let us mention that the resulting sim astrometric catalog will be derived by reducing the collected data to the solar system barycenter . in this case the uncertainty in earth s barycentric velocity may be additional source of errors .",
    "let us estimate the accuracy of the presently known value for earth barycentric velocity @xmath156 .",
    "it is known that the earth velocity uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the earth s orbital plane orientation , at the @xmath1551 mas level , giving a velocity uncertainty of @xmath1550.03 mm / s .",
    "however , there may be given another more conservative estimate to this quantity by using the accuracy of determination of the earth - moon barycenter , which is presently known to accuracy of about @xmath157 km .",
    "this number helps to estimate the present accuracy of knowledge the earth s barycentric velocity as @xmath158mm / s , thus offering a fair possibility for @xmath159as astrometry [ that , as we saw , requires @xmath160 4mm / s ] .",
    "so this is not a problem for sim .",
    "the requirements on the navigational accuracy obtained here , relate to the interferometer itself and not to the center of mass of the spacecraft . in the case of changing of the center mass of the spacecraft ( which may occur due to different reasons , such as the rotation during imaging mode , or due to the use of propellant , etc . )",
    ", the navigational parameters should be re - calculated to the required accuracy .",
    "let us also mention that at the sim level of accuracy a more subtle effects on the motion of the earth about the sun will start to play an important role .",
    "these effects are the moon s and the largest planets influence , and , probably , the body - body interaction between the earth and the moon , the spin - orbital connection in the earth dynamics , the solar rotations and pulsations , influence of solar plasma , etc .",
    "all of these effects will have to be calculated and properly included into the models for astrometric grid simulations and corresponding data analysis .",

    "<S> we address the issue of relativistic stellar aberration requirements for the space interferometry mission ( sim ) . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the importance of this issue for sim , we have considered a problem of relative astrometric observations of two stars separated by angle @xmath0 on the sky with a single baseline interferometer . while a definitive answer on the stellar aberration issue may be obtained only in numerical simulations based on the accurate astrometric model of the instrument , one could still derive realistic conclusions by accounting for the main expected properties of sim . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have analysied how the expected astrometric accuracy of determination of positions , parallaxes and proper motions will constrain the accuracy of the spaceraft navigation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the astrometric errors introduced by imperfect metrology ( variations of the calibration term across the tile of interest ) , errors in the baseline length estimations , and those due to orbital motion of the spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate requirements on the data sampling rate necessary to apply on - board in order to correct for the stellar aberration . we have shown that the worst case observation scenario is realized for the motion of the spacecraft in the direction perpendicular to the tile . </S>",
    "<S> this case of motion will provide the most stringent requirement on the accuracy of knowledge of the velocity s magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implication of the results obtained for the future mission analysis . </S>"
