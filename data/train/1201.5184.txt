    "over short length scales , high - fidelity quantum - state transfer ( qst ) from one region to another is a fundamental task in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is required to ensure a perfect communication between the different parts of a quantum computer ( qc ) or between adjacent qcs . in that case ,",
    "solid - state based system is the ideal candidate for scalable computing for , at least , two main reasons @xcite .",
    "first , in a lattice , the information is encoded on elementary excitations that naturally propagate owing to inherent interactions between neighboring sites .",
    "qst is thus spontaneously achieved without any external control .",
    "second , no interfacing is needed between the qcs and the communication channel ( cc ) that involves the same elementary excitations . because the cc depends on the way the information is implemented ,",
    "different strategies have been elaborated , such as optical lattices@xcite , arrays of quantum dots@xcite , conducting polymers@xcite and spin networks@xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that qubits may be encoded on intramolecular vibrations @xcite so that vibration - mediated qst is a promising alternative for quantum information processing @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a protocol in which a molecular lattice plays the role of the cc , qst being mediated by high - frequency vibrational excitons .",
    "indeed , molecular lattices exhibit regularly distributed atomic subunits .",
    "owing to dipole - dipole interactions , the energy of a specific internal vibration delocalizes between these subunits giving rise to narrow - band excitons .",
    "although many properties of the excitons have been studied@xcite , their potential interest for qst has been suggested very recently@xcite .",
    "the main idea is to encode the information on a vibrational qubit defined as a superimposition involving the vacuum and one - exciton states .",
    "unfortunately , the exciton does not propagate freely along the lattice .",
    "it interacts with a phonon bath that tends to destroy the coherent nature of any vibrational qubit .",
    "the exciton properties are thus described by a reduced density matrix ( rdm ) whose behavior is governed by a generalized master equation ( gme)@xcite . to understand quantum decoherence , we have studied excitonic coherences , i.e. the rdm matrix elements that measure the ability of the exciton to be in a qubit state@xcite .",
    "the dynamics was described using a frhlich model@xcite within the nonadiabatic weak - coupling limit , i.e. a common situation for vibrational excitons .",
    "it has been shown that high - fidelity qst requires the use of a finite - size system .",
    "indeed , in an infinite lattice@xcite , the phonons behave as a reservoir .",
    "the markov limit is reached and standard gme approaches can be used .",
    "dephasing limited - coherent motion takes place so that the coherences localize preventing any efficient qst . by contrast , in a finite - size lattice , a strong non - markovian regime occurs resulting in the breakdown of gme methods@xcite . to overcome this problem ,",
    "perturbation theory ( pt ) has been applied successfully@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the phonons evolve differently depending on whether the exciton occupies the vacuum or an excited state .",
    "exciton - phonon entanglement takes place resulting in the decay of the excitonic coherences . nevertheless , the decoherence depends on the nature of the one - exciton state .",
    "in particular , for odd lattice sizes , the coherence involving the state located at the band center survives over an extremely long - time scale , even at high temperature . unfortunately , this state is a stationary wave unable to carry information between the lattice sides .",
    "nevertheless , we can take advantage of its robustness against decoherence to define a protocol quite similar to that introduced by yao et al . in spin chains@xcite .",
    "the main idea is to consider qst between two distant molecular groups that are grafted on the lattice sides .",
    "the structure must be designed so that a vibration of each molecular group is resonant with the robust state of the lattice while remaining insensitive to the phonons .",
    "the grafted groups play the role of the qcs whereas the lattice defines the cc .",
    "dipole - dipole interactions couple the qcs with the cc and allow the exciton propagation so that neither control nor interfacing is required .",
    "in such a confined system , strong non - markovian effects will occur so that the dynamics will be addressed within the effective hamiltonian concept provided by pt@xcite .",
    "however , the fundamental question arises whether pt is relevant or not , depending on the model parameters . to answer that question",
    ", we shall restrict our attention to a system in which only the lowest frequency phonon mode ( lfpm ) is considered , this mode being responsible for the largest perturbation of the exciton dynamics@xcite .",
    "due to its simplicity , this model can be solved exactly so that the pt performance can been checked easily .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the exciton - phonon hamiltonian is described and qst is formulated in terms of the excitonic coherences . then , pt is applied to evaluate the system eigenproperties and to determine an approximate expression of the exciton rdm . in sec .",
