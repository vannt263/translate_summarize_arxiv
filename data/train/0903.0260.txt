    "a gas of non - relativistic bosons with a repulsive pointlike interaction is one of the simplest interacting statistical systems .",
    "since the first experimental realization @xcite of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite with ultracold gases of bosonic atoms , important experimental advances have been achieved , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic observables like the specific heat @xcite or properties of the phase transition like the critical exponent @xmath1 @xcite have been measured in harmonic traps .",
    "still , the theoretical description of these apparently simple systems is far from being complete .",
    "this is partly due to the failure of perturbation theory for several interesting regions in the phase diagram : the quantum critical behavior in the limit of zero temperature @xcite or the critical behavior near the second order phase transition between the disordered and the bec - phase .",
    "also the generic infrared behavior in the bec - phase , which is associated to a goldstone boson , is non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "this issue becomes particularly important in two- or one - dimensional systems .",
    "in this paper we employ non - perturbative flow equations for an investigation of the thermodynamic quantities for interacting bosons in three dimensions . in this approach",
    "the complications of the long - distance physics can be isolated and solved by a stepwise integration of the fluctuation effects .",
    "already in a simple truncation we obtain a rather complete picture of the temperature and density dependence of many thermodynamic observables . in turn , if some of these observables can be measured precisely , and if the finite size effects due to the trap are properly taken into account , one may use such observables as compressibility or sound velocity as a precise `` thermometer '' of the system .",
    "simultaneous knowledge of two independent thermodynamic observables will be sufficient to determine the thermodynamic parameters  the temperature @xmath2 and the density @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we study the dependence of the observables on the interaction strength .",
    "if the interaction strength can be varied experimentally , for example by its dependence on a magnetic fields , many aspects of our computations can be tested by observation .",
    "in particular , we have computed several non - analytic features near the phase transition .",
    "while the critical exponents and amplitude ratios in the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath4 are given by universal laws , the amplitudes themselves as well as the approach to criticality and the location and size of the critical region in the phase diagram are non - universal .",
    "the dependence of these quantities on the interaction strength may become an important test for non - perturbative methods .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of a statistical system in thermal and chemical equilibrium , are described by the grand canonical partition function @xmath5 the trace operation includes a summation over all possible states of the system including varying particle number @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath7 with units where @xmath8 .",

    "where @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the mass of the atoms .",
    "apart from the chemical potential and the kinetic energy we include a repulsive pointlike interaction .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath21 determines the scattering length @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 the functional integral in eq .",
    "is gaussian and can be done analytically , however for @xmath24 this is not possible any more . for small @xmath25 , or",
    "more precisely small @xmath26 , one might try to make a perturbative analysis by expanding in @xmath25 , but this often leads to infrared problems .",
    "furthermore , we also want to cover the case of strong interactions .",
    "the method we use to determine the partition function in eq .",
    "is of a different kind .",
    "we do not perform the functional integral in one step . instead , we integrate out fluctuations with large momenta first and fluctuations with small momenta later . from a physical point of view",
    "it is not reasonable to include the effect of fluctuations up to an infinetly large momentum scale . a microscopic action as in eq .",
    "is an effective description of the physics at some momentum scale @xmath27 ( somewhat smaller than the inverse bohr radius @xmath28 ) . at larger momentum or for larger energies , the physics is modified .",
    "for example , one might have to include photons and electrons into the description and at even larger energies quarks and gluons .",
    "all this is not visible anymore in the `` microscopic action ''  the fluctuations with momenta @xmath29 have already been `` integrated out '' .",
    "starting from eq . , the computations of thermodynamics should only include fluctuations with momenta smaller than the `` ultraviolet cutoff '' @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , any real system or any given physical observation has also an effective `` infrared cutoff '' scale @xmath30 , such that only fluctuations in the range @xmath31 matter .",
    "it makes no sense to include fluctuations with a wavelength larger than the size of some macroscopic probe .",
    "alternatively , @xmath30 may also be set by an inverse characteristic wavelength of some measurement device . at the scale @xmath30",
    "we would like to dispose of an object similar to the action , with the difference that now all fluctuations with @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 are integrated out .",
    "such an `` average action '' @xcite @xmath34 averages out all structures with wavelength smaller then @xmath35 and only retains the `` macroscopic '' information about physics at the momentum scale @xmath30 .",
    "it will constitute a landau - type theory for the macroscopic physics .",
    "thermodynamic quantities can be easily derived from @xmath34 , since no further fluctuations need to be taken into account .",
    "the basic challenge of a computation of thermodynamics from given microscopic laws is to build a bridge from the microscopic action @xmath36 to the average action @xmath34 .",
    "this can be a difficult task , since @xmath34 may be rather different from @xmath37 .",
    "typically , a large part of the precise microscopic information is lost in the averaging procedure . on the other hand , new phenomena due to",
    "collective effects may appear in @xmath38 , which are not directly visible in @xmath37 .",
    "the basic idea of our approach is to make the infrared cutoff scale @xmath39 variable .",
    "the resulting `` _ flowing action _ '' or scale dependent average action @xmath40 interpolates continuously between the microscopic action for @xmath41 and the macroscopic action @xmath34 .",
    "lowering @xmath39 from @xmath27 to @xmath30 the fluctuation effects are included stepwise . in this sense",
    "it realizes the wilsonian idea of renormalization , even though the implementation of a sliding infrared cutoff leads to several important conceptual and technical differences as compared to the sliding ultraviolet cutoff investigated in the first approaches to functional renormalization @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the flowing action @xmath40 on the infrared cutoff scale @xmath39 obeys an exact functional differential equation @xcite .",
    "it can be solved approximately by a truncation of the most general functional form of the flowing action .",
    "such truncations do not have to rely on the expansion in some small parameter as the interaction strength and can describe physical phenomena that are `` non - perturbative '' .",
    "the average potential @xmath42 obtains from @xmath43 $ ] by using for the argument a homogeneous ( and @xmath14-independent ) field @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    "an evaluation of the potential at its minimum , @xmath46 , yields directly the grand canonical partition function .",
    "@xmath47 with @xmath48 the expectation value or order parameter @xmath49 can be associated with the condensate density .",
    "the average potential @xmath42 obeys the exact flow equation @xmath50 we use the matsubara formalism with @xmath51    in our truncation we approximate the momentum dependence of the inverse propagator for the radial and angular ( goldstone ) mode by @xmath52 the flow equations for the quantities @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective potential @xmath56 is related to the pressure by @xmath57 which has the differential @xmath58 here we use @xmath59 for the entropy density and @xmath60 for the particle density .",
    "the formal infinite volume limit corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "we can use our method to determine many thermodynamic quantities .",
    "derivatives of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath2 and and @xmath62 are taken numerically by solving the flow equation for close enough values of @xmath2 and @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical effort is reduced and the accuracy increased by using an additional flow equation for @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the details of our method as well as explicit expressions for the flow equations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the approximation scheme we use in this paper is basically the same as the one used there .",
    "since we use an infrared cutoff only for momenta but not for frequencies , the correct ultraviolet convergence for the sum of the matsubara frequencies is not automatically obeyed for the flow equations .",
    "we have checked that all thermodynamic quantities discussed in this paper show a satisfactory convergence of the matsubara sum , except for the pressure . in the flow equation for @xmath65 we set the frequency coefficients to their microscopic values @xmath66 , @xmath67 for very large matsubara frequencies",
    "@xmath68 .    for bosons with a pointlike repulsive interaction we found in @xcite that the scattering length is bounded by the ultraviolet scale @xmath69 .",
    "this is an effect due to quantum fluctuations similar to the `` triviality bound '' for the higgs scalar in the standard model of elementary particle physics . for a given value of the dimensionless combination @xmath26",
    "we can not choose @xmath70 larger then @xmath71 .",
    "for our numerical calculations we use @xmath72 .",

    "the momentum scale associated to the chemical potential is @xmath77 . for small temperatures and",
    "scattering length one finds @xmath78 and thus @xmath79 .",
    "we finally note that the thermodynamic relations for intensive quantities can only involve dimensionless ratios .",
    "we may set the unit of momentum by @xmath80 .",
    "the thermodynamic variables are then @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ". the thermodynamic relations will depend on the strength of the repulsive interaction @xmath25 or the scattering length @xmath22 , and therefore on a `` concentration '' type parameter @xmath83 .",
    "let us start our discussion of the thermodynamic properties with the density .",
    "in the grand canonical formalism it is obtained by taking the derivative of the thermodynamic potential with respect to @xmath62 @xmath84 we could compute the @xmath62-derivative of @xmath85 numerically by solving the flow equation for u with neighboring values of @xmath62 . in @xcite",
    "we also describe another method which employs a flow equation directly for @xmath3 . since we often express dimensionful quantities in units of the interparticle distance @xmath86 , it is crucial to have an accurate value for the density @xmath3 .",
    "comparison of the numerical evaluation and the solution of a separate flow equation for @xmath3 shows higher precision for the latter method and we will therefore employ the flow equation .",
    "we plot in fig .",

    "for all three curves we use @xmath92 . ]    for a comparison with experimentally accessible quantities we have to replace the interaction parameter @xmath25 in the microscopic action by a scattering length @xmath22 which is a macroscopic quantity . for this purpose",
    "we start the flow at the uv - scale @xmath93 with a given @xmath25 , and then compute the scattering length in vacuum ( @xmath94 ) by following the flow to @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this is a standard procedure in quantum field theory , where a `` bare coupling '' ( @xmath25 ) is replaced by a renormalized coupling ( @xmath22 ) . for an investigation of the role of the strength of the interaction we may consider different values of the `` concentration '' @xmath96 or of the product @xmath88 . while the concentration is easier to access for observation , it is also numerically more demanding since for every value of the parameters one has to tune @xmath62 in order to obtain the appropriate density .",
    "for this reason we rather present results for three values of @xmath88 , i.  e. @xmath97 ( case i ) , @xmath98 ( case ii ) and @xmath99 ( case iii ) .",
