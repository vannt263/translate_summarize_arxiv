    "the recent discovery @xcite of a clear metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in the vanadium bronze @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  has sparked a revival of interest in this quasi one - dimensional metallic system .",
    "in addition to the mit , @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3undergoes a structural sodium ordering transition at higher temperatures , a magnetic transition at low temperatures , and a transition into a superconducting state under high pressure @xcite .",
    "several important aspects of this 1d material have remained unclear , including the nature of the spin and charge excitations , and the relation between the na ordering and the mit .",
    "this contribution presents a raman and optical study of @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  focusing on the various phase transitions and electron phonon coupling in this compound .",
    "at room temperature @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  has a monoclinic structure ( spacegroup c@xmath4 , a=10.08   , b=3.61   , c=15.44   , @xmath5=109.6@xmath6 . ) @xcite .",
    "the structure consists of zigzag double chains of vo@xmath7 octahedra , forming sheet by joining corners .",
    "these sheets are separated by additional chains of double vo@xmath3 trigonal bipiramids , giving rise to unidirectional tunnels along * b * ( see fig.[structure ] ) in which the na ions are located . at a sodium stoichiometry of 0.33 ,",
    "there is exactly one sodium atom per primitive cell .",
    "the sodium ion can occupy two closely spaced positions , although simultaneous occupation of the two sites is prohibited ( the distance between the sites is 1.95   ) .",
    "nmr experiments @xcite suggest that , at room temperature , the occupation of these two sites is random giving rise to a disordered structure . at @xmath8240",
    "k a second order phase transition occurs in which the sodium atoms order in a zigzag fashion along the unique axis accompanied by a doubling of the b - axis @xcite .",
    "two additional transitions occur at lower temperatures . at @xmath8136",
    "k a metal - insulator transition has been observed , in which the unit cell undergoes and additional tripling along the b - axis @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the charge ordering occurs due to a localization of the charge on chains along the b - direction formed by the v@xmath9 ions .",
    "finally , at @xmath822 k there is a transition from the paramagnetic high temperature state to a canted antiferromagnetic state @xcite",
    "the samples used in this study have been prepared as described in @xcite .",
    "typical sizes are 5 - 6 mm along the b - direction and about 0.3 - 1  mm in the other two directions . for the raman experiments ,",
    "samples were mounted in a flow cryostat ( stabilization better than 1 k ) .",
    "polarized spectra have been recorded in a back reflection geometry using an ar@xmath10 ion laser ( 514 nm ) for excitation ( power @xmath11 mw , spot size 100 @xmath12 m ) and a state of the art triple pass raman spectrometer with diode array detection .",
    "typical spectra are shown in figure [ raman ] ( left part ) .",
    "due to the low symmetry and the large number of atoms in the unit cell , the spectra show a large number of active phonon modes in all symmetries .",
    "what immediately draws attention is the large width of most of the observed phonon modes . in particular in the 400 - 800 @xmath13  region , the line widths are 10 - 50 @xmath13 .",
    "the active phonons here are expected to be vanadium - oxygen bending modes .",
    "this strong broadening is believed to be due to a strong electron phonon coupling , consistent with a polaronic picture of the electronic properties of this material @xcite .",
    "the coupling is then a result of the modulation of the hopping parameters for o(2p)-v(3d ) hopping by the phonons .",
    "a group theoretical analysis show that the room temperature * k*=0 optical phonons can be classified as @xmath14 , in which the _ gerade _ modes are raman active ( @xmath15 in ( aa),(bb ) , ( cc ) , and ( ac ) , and @xmath16 in ( ab ) and ( bc ) polarization ) and the _ ungerade _ ir active ( @xmath17 for b polarization , @xmath18 for a and c polarizations ) .",
    "consistent with the crystal symmetry 16 modes are observed in @xmath15 symmetry , and 9 in @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "the missing modes might be to weak to be observed , but might also escape detection due to near degeneracy .    below the sodium ordering transition the crystal structure adheres to a @xmath19 @xcite symmetry .",
    "the symmetry analysis leads now to a decomposition @xmath20  for the optical modes .",
    "experimentally 55 modes are observed in @xmath15 symmetry , and 20 in @xmath16 symmetry . below the charge ordering transition the unit cell triples , leading to about 190 active phonons for each irreducible representation .",
    "although a few phonons seem to be activated below the metal insulator transition , the spectra do not show this tripling .",
    "again , this might be due to a lack of scattering strength or near degeneracies .",
    "the strongest changes in the spectra are observed below the metal insulator transition at @xmath21  k. this is exemplified in figure [ raman ] ( right panel ) .",
    "apparently , the localization of the electrons leads to a decrease of the coupling of the phonons to electronic excitations .",
    "temperature dependent optical constants of @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  in the nir - uv range ( 6000 - 35000 @xmath13 ) have been measured using ellipsometry on a surface containing the b - axis .",
    "in addition the reflectivity spectra have been measured as a function of temperature and polarization in the ir - mir range ( 20 - 6000 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the optical conductivity of @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  has been determined by combining the reflectivity data with the ellipsometric data and performing a kramers - kronig analysis @xcite .",
    "the room temperature results are shown in figure [ iroverview ] .",
    "the strong absorption band observed above 10000 @xmath13  in both spectra is due to charge transfer excitations from the oxygen 2p to the vanadium 3d levels , similar as has been observed in @xmath22nav@xmath2o@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity @xmath23 b - axis shows an absorption band around 8000 @xmath13 , again similar to what is observed in @xmath22nav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "this band is probably due to a bonding - antibonding transition on the v@xmath24-o - v@xmath25 bonds @xcite .    at lower energy",
    "the one dimensional metallic nature of @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  is clearly demonstrated by the finite spectral weight for @xmath26 for a polarization along the b - axis , and the tendency to zero weight in the perpendicular polarization . indeed the data @xmath27b may be fitted by a drude model , yielding an unscreened plasma frequency of @xmath283200  @xmath13 , and a scattering time @xmath2940  ps .",
    "this low energy response has been attributed to mobile small polarons",
    ". the from the optical data estimated dc conductivity is 200 @xmath30@xmath13 , which compares well to the published dc conductivity of 100 @xmath30@xmath13@xcite .",
    "another manifestation of the polaronic nature of @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3  is found in the characteristic @xcite absorption peak around 3000  @xmath13 .    at room temperature one",
    "expects a total of 32 active phonon modes , 11 in @xmath17 symmetry ( polarization along b ) , and 22 in b@xmath31 symmetry ( @xmath23 b ) . along the insulating direction ( figure [ iroverview ] , lower curve )",
    "we indeed observe 22 active phonon modes .",
    "in contrast , the metallic direction ( figure [ iroverview ] , upper curve ) exhibits only two strong phonon modes , all other modes appear as strongly broadened weak features in the spectrum , indicating again the importance of electron phonon coupling in this material . already below the sodium ordering transition one expects many new phonon modes , though only few are actually observed ( for an example see figure [ irdetail ] lower right panel ) . in contrast , the metal insulator transition leads to a spectacular gradual appearance of a large number of phonon modes ( see figure [ irdetail ] , upper and lower left panels ) .",
    "the observed behavior is reminiscent of the observation of phase- or charged phonons in several charge density wave materials , resulting from electron - phonon interactions @xcite .",
    "the raman and optical spectra presented in this contribution demonstrate in many ways the importance of electron phonon coupling in @xmath0na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the observed phonon modes and symmetry are found to be in overall agreement with the phase transitions in this material , although the appearance of the many modes in the ir spectra along the metallic direction probably does not result from symmetry breaking , but rather gain strength from electron phonon coupling in the charge ordered phase . finally , one interesting undiscussed aspect of the optical data is the appearance of a continuum and fano distortions of phonon modes ( see figure [ irdetail ] upper panel ) .",
    "the origin of this low energy continuum is presently unknown , but likely to be of electronic nature .",
