    "quantum information has disclosed a modern approach to both quantum mechanics and information theory @xcite . very recently , this field has been further developed into the so - called continuous variable  domain , where information is encoded and processed by using quantum systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite ( see also the recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "the most important example of these systems are the bosonic modes of the electromagnetic field , today manipulated with very high precision in quantum optics labs .",
    "thus , in the continuous variable framework , a wide range of results have been successfully achieved , including protocols of quantum teleportation  @xcite , teleportation networks  @xcite , entanglement swapping  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , quantum computation  @xcite and cluster quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "one of the key resources in quantum information is quantum entanglement . in the bosonic",
    "setting , quantum entanglement is usually present under the form of einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) correlations  @xcite , where the quadrature operators of two separate bosonic modes are so correlated to beat the standard quantum limit  @xcite .",
    "the simplest source of epr correlations is the two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state . in the number - ket representation , this state is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the squeezing parameter and @xmath2 is an arbitrary pair of bosonic modes , that we may call signal  and idler . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 quantifies the signal - idler entanglement and determines the mean number of photons @xmath3 in each mode .",
    "since it is entangled , the tmsv state can not be prepared by applying local operations and classical communications ( loccs ) to a couple of vacua @xmath4 or to any other kind of tensor product state .",
    "for this reason , the tmsv state can not be expressed as a classical mixture of coherent states @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 arbitrary complex amplitudes . in other words ,",
    "its p - representation  @xcite@xmath8 involves a function @xmath9 which is non - positive and , therefore , can not be considered as a genuine probability distribution . for this reason ,",
    "the tmsv  state is a particular kind of nonclassical  state .",
    "other kinds are single - mode squeezed states and fock states . by contrast a bosonic state is called classical  when its p - representation is positive , meaning that the state can be written as a classical mixture of coherent states .",
    "thus a classical source of light is composed by a set of @xmath10 bosonic modes in a state@xmath11 where @xmath9 is positive and normalized to @xmath12 .",
    "typically , classical sources are just made by a collection of coherent states with amplitudes @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 which corresponds to having @xmath15 in other situations , where the sources are particularly chaotic , they are better described by a collection of thermal states with mean photon numbers @xmath16 , so that@xmath17 more generally , we can have classical states which are not just tensor products but they have ( classical ) correlations among different bosonic modes .",
    "the comparison between classical and nonclassical states has clearly triggered a lot of interest .",
    "the main idea is to compare the use of a candidate nonclassical state , like the epr state , with all the classical states for specific information tasks .",
    "one of these tasks is the detection of low - reflectivity objects in far target regions under the condition of extremely low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "this scenario has been called quantum illumination  and has been investigated in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "more recently , epr correlations have been exploited for a completely different task in a completely different regime of parameters . in the model of quantum reading  @xcite",
    ", epr correlations have been used to retrieve information from digital memories which are reminiscent of today s optical disks , such as cds and dvds .",
    "a digital memory can in fact be modelled as a sequence of cells corresponding to beam splitters with two possible reflectivities @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( used to encode a bit of information ) . by fixing the mean total number of photons",
    "@xmath20  irradiated over each memory cell , it is possible to show that a non - classical source of light with epr correlations retrieves more information than any classical source  @xcite . in general",
    ", the improvement is found in the regime of few photons ( @xmath21 )  and for memories with high reflectivities , as typical for optical memories . in this regime ,",
    "the gain of information given by quantum reading can be dramatic , i.e. , close to @xmath12 bit for each bit of the memory .",
    "further studies on quantum reading of memories have been pursued by several authors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that other non - classical states , such as fock states , can have remarkable advantages over classical sources .",
    "@xcite has proposed an alternative model of quantum reading based on a binary phase encoding .",
    "@xcite has further studied the problem of binary discrimination in optical devices .",
    "@xcite has both proposed and experimentally implemented a model of unambiguous quantum reading .",
    "@xcite has defined the notion of quantum reading capacity , a quantity which has been also investigated in ref .",
    "finally , ref .",
    "@xcite has proposed explicit capacity - achieving receivers for quantum reading .",
    "it is fundamental to remark that an important point in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the quantum - classical comparison is performed under a _ global energy constraint _ , i.e. , by fixing the total average number of photons @xmath20  which are irradiated over each memory cell [ see fig .",
    "[ energypic](a ) ] . under this assumption , it is possible to construct an epr transmitter , made by a suitable number of tmsv states , which is able to outperform _ any _ classical source composed by _ any _ number of modes .     irradiated over the memory cell .",
    "thus , if the number of input signals is @xmath22 , each one has an average of @xmath23 photons , which goes to zero for @xmath24 .",

    ", we fix the average number of photons @xmath25 for each input signal .",
    "since the total number of signals @xmath22 can be arbitrary , we have that the total energy irradiated over the cell @xmath26 is generally unbounded.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this paper we consider a different kind of comparison : we fix the number of signal modes irradiated over the target cell ( @xmath22 ) and the mean number of photons _ per signal mode _ ( @xmath25 ) . under these assumptions",
    ", we compare an epr transmitter with a classical source .",
    "then , for fixed @xmath25 , we determine the critical number of signal modes @xmath27 after which an epr  transmitter with @xmath28 @xmath27 is able to beat any classical source ( with the same number of signals @xmath22 ) .",
    "since we are here fixing the average number of photons per signal mode , our energy constraint is now _ local _ :  it restricts the energy of each signal mode but not the energy of the total set of signal modes .",
    "we call this alternative model locally - constrained quantum reading  [ see fig .",
    "[ energypic](b ) ] .",
    "the difference between global and local energy constraints is also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the general problem of gaussian channel discrimination .",
    "mathematically speaking , both these energy constraints make the problem of channel discrimination non - trivial in the continuous variable setting , where the use of infinite energy always allows one to distinguish two gaussian channels in a perfect way . in the presence of a global energy constraint , the error probability in the gaussian channel discrimination is generally different from zero and the problem is to find the minimum value . in the presence of a local energy constraint , the error probability goes to zero with the number @xmath22 of signals and the general problem is to study its convergence , i.e. , finding the best error exponent  @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the present paper shows that the best convergence of the error probability has to be found within the set of non - classical states .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we review the basic readout mechanism of quantum reading specifying the analysis to the case of a local energy constraint . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we explicitly show how epr  correlations can be used to beat any classical source of light in the readout of information .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] is for conclusions .",
    "note that we also provide two appendices . in appendix  [ appmethods ]",
    "we discuss the general mathematical methods used in our derivations , and appendix  [ apptech ] contains some technical proofs .",
    "here we briefly review the basic readout mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite , specifying the study to the case of a local energy constraint . consider a model of a digital optical memory ( or disk ) where the memory cells are beam splitter mirrors with different reflectivities @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) .",
    "in particular , the bit - value @xmath31 is encoded in a lower - reflectivity mirror ( @xmath32 ) , that we may call a _ pit _ , while the bit - value @xmath33 is encoded in a higher - reflectivity mirror ( @xmath34 ) , that we may call a _ land _ ( see  fig .  [ qreadpic ] ) .",
    "close to the disk , a reader aims to retrieve the value of the bit @xmath35 which is stored in each memory cell . for this purpose ,",
    "the reader exploits a transmitter ( to probe a target cell ) and a receiver ( to measure the corresponding output ) . in general , the transmitter consists of two quantum systems , called _ signal _ @xmath36 and _ idler _ @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the signal system @xmath36 is a set of @xmath22 bosonic modes which are directly shined on the target cell .",
    "the mean total number of photons of this system is simply given by @xmath38 , where @xmath25 is the mean number of photons per signal mode ( simply called energy , hereinbelow ) . at the output of the cell , the reflected system @xmath39 is combined with the idler system @xmath37 , which is a supplementary set of bosonic modes whose number @xmath40 can be completely arbitrary",
    ". both the systems @xmath39 and @xmath37 are finally measured by the receiver ( see  fig .  [ qreadpic ] ) .",
    "encoding bit - value @xmath31 and @xmath34 encoding bit - value @xmath33 .",
    "* readout*. a reader is generally composed by a transmitter and a receiver .",
    "it retrieves a stored bit by probing a memory cell with a signal system @xmath36 ( composed of @xmath22 bosonic modes ) and detecting the reflected system @xmath39 together with an idler system @xmath37 ( composed of @xmath40 bosonic modes ) . in general , the output system @xmath39 combines the signal system @xmath36 with a bath system @xmath41 ( @xmath22 bosonic modes in thermal states ) .",
    "the transmitter is in a state @xmath42 which can be classical ( a classical transmitter ) or non - classical ( a quantum transmitter ) .",
    "in particular , we consider a quantum transmitter with epr  correlations between the signal and idler systems . in this paper ,",
    "the quantum - classical comparison is performed under a local energy constraint , i.e. , by fixing the average number of photons @xmath25 per signal mode ( the signal system @xmath36 has a total average number of photons @xmath38 which is generally unbounded).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we assume that alice s apparatus is very close to the disk , so that no significant source of noise is present in the gap between the disk and the decoder . however , we assume that non - negligible noise comes from the thermal bath present at the other side of the disk .",
    "this bath generally describes stray photons , transmitted by previous cells and bouncing back to hit the next ones .",
    "for this reason , the reflected system @xmath39 combines the signal system @xmath36 with a bath system @xmath41 of @xmath22 modes .",
    "these environmental modes are assumed in a tensor product of thermal states , each one with @xmath43 mean photons ( white thermal noise ) .",
    "thus , in this model we identify five basic parameters : the reflectivities of the memory @xmath44 , the temperature of the bath @xmath43 , and the profile of the signal @xmath45 , which is given by the number of signals @xmath22  and the energy @xmath25 .    in general , for a fixed input state @xmath42 at the transmitter ( systems @xmath46 ) , alice will get two possible output states @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the receiver ( systems @xmath49 ) .",
    "these output states are the effect of two different quantum channels , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which depend on the bit @xmath52 stored in the target cell .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath53 where the conditional channel @xmath54 acts on the signal system , while the identity channel @xmath55 acts on the idler system .",

    "now , the minimum error probability @xmath59 affecting the decoding of @xmath35 is just the error probability affecting the statistical discrimination of the two output states , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , via an optimal receiver .",

    "we compare the performance of decoding in two paradigmatic situations , one where the transmitter is described by a non - classical state ( a quantum transmitter ) and one where the transmitter is in a classical state ( a classical transmitter ) .",
    "in particular , we show how a quantum transmitter with epr correlations ( an epr transmitter ) is able to outperform classical transmitters .",
    "the quantum - classical comparison is performed for a fixed signal profile @xmath45 .",
    "then , for various fixed values of the energy @xmath25 ( local energy constraint ) , we study the critical number of signal modes @xmath27 after which an epr transmitter ( with @xmath64 signals ) is able to beat any classical transmitter ( with the same number of signals @xmath22 ) .",
