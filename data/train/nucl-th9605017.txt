    "first evidence of the violation of time reversal symmetry has been found in the kaon system  @xcite . despite strong efforts no other signal of violation of time",
    "reversal symmetry has been found to date .",
    "however , by now , studying time reversal symmetry has become a corner stone of the search for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles  @xcite .",
    "some alternatives or extensions of the standard model are due to dynamical symmetry breaking , multi higgs models , spontaneous symmetry breaking , grand unified theories ( e.g. so(10 ) ) , extended gauge groups ( leading e.g. to right - handed bosons @xmath3 in left - right symmetric models ) , super symmetric ( susy ) theories , etc .",
    ", each implying specific ways of @xmath4 violation .",
    "for a recent review of models relevant in the context of @xmath4 violation see e.g.  @xcite , and refs . therein .",
    "these theories `` beyond '' the standard model are formulated in terms of quarks and leptons whereas nuclear low energy tests of @xmath4 involve hadronic degrees of freedom ( mesons and nucleons )  @xcite . to extract hadronic degrees of freedom from observables one may introduce effective @xmath1odd nucleon nucleon potentials  @xcite , or more specific @xmath1odd mesonic exchange potentials  @xcite . as in the context of @xmath0-violation",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , these potentials have been proven quite useful to treat the nuclear structure part involved and to extract effective @xmath1odd hadronic coupling constants  @xcite . in turn",
    "they allow to compare the sensitivity of different experiments , which has been done recently in ref .",
    "however , in order to compare upper bounds on a more fundamental level of @xmath1odd interactions , it is necessary to relate hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom in some way .",
    "this step is hampered by the absence of a complete solution of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) at the energies considered here . in many cases a rough estimate in the context of time",
    "reversal violation may be sufficient , and , in the simplest case , factors arising from hadronic structure may be neglected . in the context of @xmath0odd time reversal violation",
    "e.g. concepts such as pcac and current algebra  @xcite have been utilized to improve the evaluation of hadronic structure effects . in the @xmath0even case , which is considered here ,",
    "this approach is not applicable ( no goldstone bosons involved here ) .",
    "however , it may be useful to utilize quark models specifically designed for and quite successful in describing the low energy sector .",
    "in fact , experimental precision tests still continue to make progress and so theorists face a renewed challenge to translate these experimental constrains to a more fundamental interaction level .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give estimates on hadronic matrix elements that arise when relating quark operators to the effective hadronic parameterizations of the @xmath0even @xmath1odd interaction .",
    "these are the charge @xmath2 type exchange and the axial vector type exchange nucleon nucleon interaction  @xcite",
    ". they will shortly be outlined in the next section .",
    "the ansatz to calculate @xmath5 matrix elements from the quark structure is described in section iii .",
    "the last section gives the result for different types of quark models and a conclusion .",
    "for completeness , note that in general also @xmath1-odd and @xmath0-odd interactions are possible , and in fact most of the simple extensions of the standard model mentioned above give rise to such type of @xmath1violation .",
    "parameterized as one boson exchanges they lead e.g. to effective pion exchange potentials that are essentially long range , see  @xcite .",
    "limits on @xmath0odd @xmath1odd interactions are rather strongly bound by electric dipole moment measurements , in particular by that of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "in contrast bounds on @xmath0even @xmath1odd interactions are rather weak .",
    "note , also that despite theoretical considerations  @xcite new experiments testing generic @xmath1odd @xmath0even observables have been suggested ; for the present status see e.g. refs .",
    "due to the moderate energies involved in nuclear physics tests of time reversal symmetry , hadronic degrees of freedom are useful and may be reasonable to analyze and to compare different types of experiments .",
    "for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following only @xmath1-odd and @xmath0-_even _ interactions will be considered .",
    "they may be parameterized in terms of effective one boson exchange potentials . due to the behavior under @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath0 , and @xmath1 symmetry transformations , see e.g.  @xcite , two basic contributions are possible then : a charged @xmath2 type exchange  @xcite and an axial vector exchange  @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath2 type @xmath1odd interaction is @xmath6odd due to the phase appearing in the isospin sector and is only possible for charged @xmath2 exchange .",
    "it has been suggested by simonius and wyler , who used the tensor part to parameterize the interaction  @xcite , @xmath7 there is some question of whether to choose an `` anomalous '' coupling  @xcite , viz . @xmath8 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath9 is usually taken to be @xmath10 close to the strong interaction case  @xcite .",
    "we shall see in the following that it is not unreasonable to introduce such a factor since in may be related to `` nucleonic structure effects '' , which are not of @xmath1 violating origin ( similar to nuclear structure effects that are also treated separately ) . combining the @xmath1odd vertex with the appropriate @xmath1even vertex leads to the following effective @xmath1odd @xmath0even one boson exchange @xmath5 interaction , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and",
    "@xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the strong coupling constant , as e.g. provided by the bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "the axial vector type interaction has been suggested by  @xcite . unlike the @xmath2type interaction the isospin dependence is not restricted and may be isoscalar , vector , and/or tensor type .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the @xmath15 coupling for example is given by @xmath16 combined with the appropriate @xmath1even vertex this leads to an effective axial vector type exchange @xmath5 potential  @xcite , @xmath17 the bounds on the @xmath1odd coupling strengths arising from various experiments have been discussed in ref .",
    "a more recent bound not included there is from an improved analysis  @xcite of the @xmath18fe @xmath19decay experiment  @xcite .",
    "bounds are in the order of 10% if derived from generic @xmath1odd @xmath0even observables and slightly more than an order of magnitude smaller , if related to the electric dipole moments  @xcite . to complete this section , note",
    "that although possible , two boson exchanges have not been considered up to now .",
    "we now turn to effective @xmath1-odd @xmath0-even quark operators . the simplest operator that leads to an effective @xmath1odd @xmath0even vector type vertex @xmath20 analogous to the @xmath2type interaction eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vnn ] ) is @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 denote flavored quark fields .",
    "again the flavor dependence is responsible for @xmath6 , viz .",
    "@xmath1violation due to the phase dependence .",
    "a tensor term has not been introduced for simplicity . on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ quarkv ] ) such a term will arise in a natural way in the effective hadronic @xmath24 @xmath1-odd lagrangian through the quark structure effects as will be explained below .",
    "the second generic quark operator utilizing axial vector bilinear operators is given by  @xcite , @xmath25 with the on  shell equivalent @xmath26    in order to recover eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : vnn ] ) and ( [ eqn : ann ] ) we utilize the constituent quark model .",
    "this model has been rather successful and valuable in reproducing gross features of low energy phenomenae , such as mass spectra , form factors , coupling constants , magnetic moments etc .",
    ", see e.g.  @xcite .    to relate quark operators to effective hadronic operators we utilize the fock space representation of hadrons in terms of constituent quarks , viz .",
    "@xmath27 since there is no low energy solution of qcd , the evaluation of the matrix elements of the l.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ fock ] ) needs further consideration . in general",
    ", the same problem arises in the context of strong interactions .",
    "an extensive overview of the different approaches to tackle the problem in this case has been given by ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we follow the ideas first formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and extensively studied for different quark models in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting strong interaction potential is a generic hybrid model connecting quark degrees of freedom with effective meson nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic idea is summarized in the following .",
    "suppose the two nucleons overlap , and two quarks are sufficiently close together .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : qqnn]a ) .",
    "then , to begin with , the matrix elements may be evaluated without introducing any mesonic fields . in terms of the constituent quark model @xmath28 excitations",
    "are neglected ( or partially parameterized in the constituent quark mass ) . only at larger distances of the nucleons ,",
    "mesons are essential and may appear as @xmath28 correlations on the nonperturbative qcd vacuum  @xcite that might be the physical vacuum of the low energy regime  @xcite .",
    "however , the appearance of mesons is disconnected from the problem of @xmath1odd force .",
    "therefore , in the following we assume that the hadronization mechanism is the _",
    "same for both @xmath1odd and the usual @xmath1even strong interaction _ and investigate the relative strength of the @xmath1odd matrix elements to the @xmath1even matrix elements .",
    "this is done in the framework of the virginia potential that assumes a quark pairing mechanism to generate effective meson nucleon coupling constants  @xcite . to illustrate the quality of this ansatz table  [ tab : virginia ]",
    "shows the resulting coupling constants using different quark models compared to the values of a recent version of the bonn potential  @xcite .    in this framework",
    "we utilize the factorization approximation to evaluate the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ fock ] ) , see figure  [ fig : qqnn]b ) @xmath29 to demonstrate the calculation , we use the simple constituent quark model .",
    "this model is supplemented by an explicit lower component , which already occurs implicitly in the dirac magnetic moments  @xcite and in the two ",
    "body pair current through electromagnetic gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "this way a treatment of relativistic effects has been introduced , see e.g.  @xcite and ref . therein .",
    "the integration of the internal degrees of freedom reads , @xmath30\\ ] ] with @xmath31 the three quark wave internal function . in the rest system the space part of the wave function",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath32\\ ] ] where numerical values may be chosen as @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinates are normalized lovelace coordinates , viz .",
    "@xmath2 for the pair and @xmath35 for the odd quark .",
    "integration is done in the breit system .",
    "the symbol @xmath36 denotes either one of the vertices in ( [ quark ] ) .",
    "evaluation for the different type of operators leads to the following expressions ( using the isospin formalism for @xmath37 quarks ) @xmath38 the factors arising are related to the quark structure of nucleons .",
    "note , that in eq .",
    "( [ axial ] ) one recognizes the well known coupling of the axial vector current ( for @xmath39 ) , viz .",
    "@xmath40 of the nonrelativistic constituent quark model , besides factors arising from relativistic corrections due to the lower dirac component .",
    "the latter reduce the value of @xmath41 close to the experimental one  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) a tensor coupling appears , which belongs to the @xmath2 type @xmath1odd exchange . indeed due to the quark structure factors its relative strength is larger than the first term of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) , and therefore preferable in an ansatz of a @xmath2type @xmath1odd force as done by simonius and wyler  @xcite .",
    "the factor in front the tensor term may be interpreted as `` anomalous '' coupling .",
    "it appears in analogy to the electromagnetic interaction , where the pauli term of the electromagnetic photon nucleon interaction can be recovered from a pure dirac coupling on quark level .",
    "this has been explained and shown in ref .",
    "the resulting relation between quark and hadronic @xmath1odd coupling strength on the basis of the constituent quark model is , for @xmath2 type exchange @xmath42 and for axial type of exchange @xmath43 here the expression for isoscalar and isovector are the same .",
    "similar results may be obtained using different types of quark models . in the context of the virginia potential",
    "those studied are the mit bag model and a relativistic model with linear confining potential , see ref .",
    "these are used here in the same way as demonstrated for the constituent quark model in the previous section .",
    "the values for the quark structure effects evaluated using typical quark model parameters of low energy phenomenology are given in table  [ tab : values ] .",
    "in fact , due to the symmetries inherent in the quark pairing mechanism ( viz .",
    "the virginia potential ) it is possible to arrive at the following relations between the coupling constants , viz .",
    "@xmath44 this equation shows that the factors appearing in the @xmath45 type exchange may be related to the anomalous coupling @xmath46 .",
    "so , inclusion of @xmath9 might give a bound closer to the more basic quark degrees of freedom .    in conclusion",
    ", provided the hadronization process does not substantially differ for @xmath1odd and @xmath1even interactions , the factors arising reflect the _ nucleon _ structure effects .",
    "the origin of the structure factors are due to the spin , isospin structure and the different mass scales ( i.e. @xmath47 vs. @xmath48 ) .",
    "these have also been essential in deriving the relative strength of the strong coupling constants as given in table  [ tab : virginia ] .",
