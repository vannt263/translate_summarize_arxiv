    "ever since its introduction by ihara @xcite , the zeta function of graphs has been well studied for more than 40 years .",
    "defined similar to the zeta function of curves over finite fields , the zeta function of a graph @xmath11 counts the number @xmath12 of tailless geodesic cycles in @xmath11 of length @xmath13 , and it also has an euler product expression : @xmath14 } ( 1 - u^{l([c])})^{-1},\\ ] ] where the product is over equivalence classes @xmath15 $ ] of tailless primitive geodesic cycles @xmath16 , and @xmath17)$ ] is the length of a cycle in @xmath15 $ ] . the combined results of ihara @xcite and hashimoto @xcite combined show that @xmath18 is a rational function providing topological and spectral information of the graph , and it can be expressed in terms of the vertex adjacency operator @xmath19 and the edge adjacency operator @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath11 is @xmath21-regular , its zeta function has the following form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the euler characteristic of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 satisfies the riemann hypothesis in the sense that all non - trivial poles have the same absolute value if and only if @xmath11 is spectrally optimal , called a ramanujan graph in lubotzky - phillips - sarnak @xcite .",
    "graphs are @xmath8-dimensional complexes .",
    "it is natural to search for zeta functions of finite higher dimensional complexes with similar features .",
    "when @xmath24 is a prime power , a finite @xmath21-regular graph can be identified with a finite quotient of the bruhat - tits tree @xmath25 associated to @xmath26 over a nonarchimedean local field @xmath0 with @xmath24 elements in its residue field .",
    "analogous higher dimensional complexes would be finite quotients of the bruhat - tits buildings associated to @xmath27-adic chevalley groups ; such a building is simply connected and the underlying group facilitates algebraic parametrizations of the geometric objects in the building and its finite quotients so that the whole setting is amenable to group representations .",
    "further , a cycle in a quotient is called a geodesic if it lifts to a geodesic in the building , namely a straight line in an apartment",
    ". a zeta function will count tailless geodesic cycles contained in the @xmath8-skeleton of the complex .    a closed - form expression for the zeta function @xmath28 of a two - dimensional finite complex @xmath29 which arises as a quotient of the building @xmath30 associated to @xmath31 by",
    "a discrete torsion - free co - compact subgroup @xmath5 in @xmath32 was obtained by kang and li @xcite using combinatorial and group theoretic approach , and kang - li - wang @xcite using representation - theoretic approach .",
    "it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that @xmath33 can be expressed as a rational function in two ways : one in terms of the two vertex adjacency operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the chamber adjacency operator @xmath36 on @xmath29 , and the other in terms of the edge adjacency operator @xmath37 and its transpose @xmath38 on @xmath29 as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the euler characteristic of @xmath29 .",
    "the concept of ramanujan graphs was extended to ramanujan complexes in li @xcite , and by the definition therein , @xmath29 is a ramanujan complex if and only if all nontrivial zeros of @xmath41 have the same absolute value @xmath42 . in @xcite , equivalent statements for @xmath29 being ramanujan were given in terms of the eigenvalues of the edge operator @xmath43 and those of the chamber operator @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the zeta functions of @xmath1-dimensional finite complexes associated to @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , given a discrete torsion - free co - compact subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath6 , consider the zeta function of the @xmath1-dimensional complex @xmath2 arising as the quotient by @xmath5 of the bruhat - tits building @xmath3 associated to @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath3 contains both special and non - special vertices , the group @xmath6 does not act transitively on the vertices or edges of @xmath3 , which is different from the action of @xmath32 on @xmath44 .",
    "nonetheless , the vertices , edges and directed chambers of @xmath2 can be parametrized by certain cosets of @xmath6 . using representation theoretic approach analogous to @xcite",
    ", we prove that similar statements hold for @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , theorems [ zeta1 ] and [ zeta2 ] combined give the following result .",
    "assume @xmath46 .",
    "the zeta function @xmath45 is a rational function expressed in two ways , the first in terms of the two vertex adjacency operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the chamber adjacency operator @xmath47 , and the second in terms of the two edge adjacency operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the euler characteristic of @xmath9 , and @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) is the number of special ( resp .",
    "non - special ) vertices in @xmath9 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath9 are classified into three types : primitive special , non - primitive special , and non - special .",

    "the operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 in theorem 1.1 describe adjacency among special vertices ; they can be interpreted as hecke operators on the space of @xmath54-invariant vectors in @xmath55 endowed with right regular actions by @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes the ring of integers in @xmath0 .",
    "when restricted to an irreducible unramified representation @xmath57 occurring in @xmath55 , @xmath58 in ( [ gsp4zeta ] ) with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath59 gives the reciprocal of the degree four spin @xmath60-function @xmath61 .",
    "the operator @xmath48 describes adjacency among directed edges of type @xmath8 , while @xmath49 describes adjacency among type @xmath1 edges .",
    "see  3 for algebraic and combinatorial descriptions of these adjacency operators",
    ".    extending the definition of ramanujan complexes from @xmath62 to @xmath4 , we call a finite quotient @xmath2 ramanujan if all infinite - dimensional irreducible representations occurring in @xmath55 containing nontrivial @xmath54-invariant vectors are tempered .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath63 , the ramanujan condition can be re - interpreted in terms of eigenvalues of the operators acting on vertices , edges , and directed chambers , respectively ; see  7 for details .",

    "it is interesting to compare the zeta function identities ( [ graphzeta ] ) , ( [ gl3zeta ] ) and ( [ gsp4zeta ] ) for a graph , a @xmath1-dimensional complex from @xmath44 , and a @xmath1-dimensional complex from @xmath3 to observe how the zeta identities evolve .",
    "each determinant has a combinatorial meaning and a representation - theoretic interpretation . in these three cases ,",
    "the determinant of operators on vertices occurring in the combinatorial zeta function , denoted by @xmath78 for @xmath79 , is the reciprocal of a product of local @xmath60-factors attached to unramified representations .",

    "the coset decompositions that appear in the definition above can be explicitly written out as follows : @xmath223    @xmath224    identify each vertex with its parametrization .",
