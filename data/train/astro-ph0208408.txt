    "hydrogen burning is considered through a complete network of thermonuclear reactions for the proton - proton chain and the cno bi - cycle . as a result of the various diffusion processes ,",

    "initial he wd",
    "models have been obtained by abstracting mass from a 1  m@xmath1 model at appropriate stages of its evolution off the main sequence .",
    "we have considered two different metallicity values for our wd progenitor models , @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 , chosen in order to be representative of low metallicity environments that are found in many globular clusters . for",
    "he wd models more massive than 0.2  m@xmath1 in the case of a metallicity value @xmath0= 0.001 and more massive than 0.23  m@xmath1 for @xmath0=0.0002 , mass loss was invoked at different stages during the evolution along the red giant branch .",
    "however , for less massive models we have followed a different procedure .",
    "mass loss is initiated soon after the 1  m@xmath1 model leaves the main sequence and starts its excursion redwards in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "we have followed the accepted idea that he wds ( particularly low mass he wds ) are formed in binary systems where the he wd progenitor undergoes a strong mass loss phase due to roche lobe overflow .",
    "indeed , for low mass models we have computed pre - wd evolution by imposing that mass loss rates are fixed by the condition that the stellar radius must remain close to the radius of the roche lobe . to compute the radius of the roche lobe",
    "we assume that our 1  m@xmath1 model has a 1.4  m@xmath1 companion ( representative of a pulsar companion ) .",
    "given the initial semiaxis of the orbit , we obtain the radius of the roche lobe by means of the analytic approximation given by eggleton ( 1983 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of the roche lobe , @xmath14 the semiaxis of the orbit and @xmath15 is the mass ratio .",
    "we have assumed that mass loss from our 1  m@xmath1 is fully non - conservative , i.e. all the matter lost from the wd progenitor leaves the system and carries off its intrinsic angular momentum . to this end , we have followed the formulation given by podsiadlowski , joss & hsu ( 1992 ) , that is @xmath16 here , @xmath17 means the total angular momentum , @xmath18 its time derivative caused by mass loss and @xmath19 the total mass of the system .",
    "sub - indices 1 and 2 refer to the wd progenitor and the 1.4@xmath20 companion respectively .",
    "finally @xmath21 is the mass loss rate of the wd progenitor .",
    "in addition , we have also considered angular momentum losses due to gravitational wave radiation ( landau & lifshitz 1971 ) @xmath22 which is an important contribution to angular momentum losses in binaries with very short periods .",
    "finally , magnetic stellar wind braking when a convective envelope developes has also been accounted for as in sarna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : @xmath23 in order to follow the time evolution of @xmath17 , we integrate the equation @xmath24 and with the aid of kepler s third law we finally get @xmath14 ( and @xmath13 through eq .  [ eq.egg ] ) .",
    "the present treatment for mass loss is not self - consistent since the mass loss rate is not incorporated as a new unknown quantity to be solved during the iteration procedure in the henyey scheme used to solve the stellar structure equations , but instead is fixed in advance for each model .",
    "however , we want to recall that our main interest in this work is not to analyse the properties ( initial / final periods , masses , semiaxis ) of binary systems that lead to the formation of hewd - millisecond pulsar pairs , but to study the cooling time - scales and photometric properties of cooling hewds . also , it is worth mentioning that the algorithm applied in the present work to simulate mass loss phases represents a much better approach to obtain physically sound initial hewd models than that of simply abstracting mass as done previously in althaus et al .",

    "note that during the first stages of mass loss , the wd progenitor evolves at almost constant radius .",
    "small deviations from constant - radius evolution are caused by the fact that the semiaxis increases slightly as a result of mass loss from the least massive component of the pair .",
    "as evolution proceeds , an outer convection zone developes and magnetic braking starts to play an important role with the consequent result that the orbit starts to shrink . during the final stage of mass loss",
    ", the wd progenitor evolves again at constant radius until it eventually shrinks within the roche lobe and mass loss halts .",
    "to place our results on a more quantitative basis we list in table  [ tab.bin ] the main characteristics for some of our less massive wd progenitors .",
    "in particular , for a given wd model , we list the metallicity , the surface hydrogen abundance at the end of mass loss phase and the initial and final period and semiaxis .",
    "we want to mention that our results agree quite well with more detailed calculations in which the mass loss phase is calculated self - consistently ( sarna et al . 2000 ) .",
    ".main characteristics of some low mass pre - wd progenitor calculations . [ cols=\"^,>,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab.bin ]    we want to mention that the assumptions made in our mass loss treatment give rise to initial he wd models with relatively large hydrogen envelopes , which favours the occurrence of appreciable hydrogen burning and cno thermonuclear flashes during the wd stage .",
    "this is also true if progenitor stars are more massive than the 1  m@xmath1 value assumed in this work .",
    "we have checked this assertion by performing additional calculations on the basis our mass loss prescription .",
    "however , it is possible that he wds may also be formed in binary systems which have experienced mass loss episodes via a common - envelope stage , in which case mass transfer would be unstable",
    ". this could be the case for instance if the accretor is a c / o wd ( see , for instance , han 1998 ) .",
    "this different evolutionary history for the he wd progenitor could affect the hydrogen layer thickness and accordingly the he wd cooling rate .",
    "the treatment of the common envelope stage is a difficult one and it has not been considered in this paper .    as stated before ,",
    "two low metallicity values have been considered in this study : @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 and we have computed a grid of models for each of these values . in the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 , we have followed the evolution of he wd models with stellar masses of 0.199 , 0.209 , 0.219 , 0.225 , 0.243 , 0.266 , 0.280 , 0.300 and 0.319 m@xmath1 ; and for the case of @xmath0= 0.001 we considered 0.172 , 0.183 , 0.197 , 0.230 , 0.244 , 0.300 , 0.336 , 0.380 , 0.390 , 0.422 and 0.449 m@xmath1 .",
    "all of these models were evolved from the end of mass - loss phase , during the pre - wd evolution , through the stages of hydrogen shell flashes ( when they take place ) down to very advanced stages of evolution .",
    "qualitatively , the evolution of he wds with low metallicity is not markedly different from the case of solar metallicity analysed in our previous studies ( althaus et al .",
    "indeed , we find that objects with masses above a certain threshold value experience several episodes of hydrogen thermonuclear flashes due to the massive hydrogen envelopes resulting from binary evolution .",
    "the existence of such flash episodes affect the further cooling history of the star .",
    "however , the low metal content has an important effect on the evolution of hewds , particularly regarding the occurrence and characteristics of cno thermonuclear flashes . in broad outline ,",
    "cno flashes become less intense as the metal content is decreased .",
    "this is the main reason why loops in the hrd induced by cno flashes are markedly less extended in the case of lowest metallicity .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig.tck02 ] and  [ fig.tck1 ] , where we present the evolutionary tracks of some selected hewd sequences with an initial metal content @xmath0= 0.0002 and @xmath0= 0.001 respectively .",
    "-6.2 cm     -6.2 cm    it is worth mentioning that the stellar mass threshold ( m@xmath25 ) for the occurrence of cno hydrogen flashes depends on the assumed metal content . specifically , for @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 we find a lower mass limit for the occurrence of cno flashes of m@xmath26 0.22 and 0.26 m@xmath1 , respectively ( in the case of solar metallicity m@xmath25 becomes @xmath3 0.18 m@xmath1 ; see althaus et al .",
    "with regard to the upper mass boundary , our most massive model with @xmath0= 0.0002 and 0.319  m@xmath1 is fully unstable , whilst for the case @xmath0= 0.001 we find a cno hydrogen flash even for a stellar mass value as high as 0.422  m@xmath1 , but not in the sequence with @xmath27 0.449  m@xmath1 .",
    "we also want to comment on the fact that the mass range for the occurrence of hydrogen flashes depends on whether element diffusion is considered or not , as we find previously for the solar metallicity case ( althaus et al .",
    "for instance , in the absence of diffusion , only our 0.280 , 0.300 and 0.319  m@xmath1 sequences undergo thermal instabilities in the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 . for the other metallicity value , @xmath0= 0.001",
    ", models in the range between 0.24 and 0.35  m@xmath1 approximately , suffer from this instabilities .",
    "a feature worthy of comment predicted by our calculations is the existence of thermal instabilities in models with @xmath0= 0.0002 at more advanced stages of evolution than those at which cno flashes occur .",
    "these instabilities are related to unstable hydrogen burning via the proton - proton chains ( pp ) which dominate hydrogen burning at advanced ages .",
    "the existence of such pp flashes can be understood on the basis of a much thicker hydrogen envelope characterizing these models .",
    "this is a result of the cno burning being inefficient in depleting the hydrogen content of the envelope of the star during the pre - wd evolution as well as during cno flashes .",
    "after the end of cno flash episodes , the radial extent of the upper boundary of the hydrogen burning shell diminishes as evolution proceeds . at the same time",
    ", some hydrogen chemically diffuses downwards to hotter layers .",
    "when the burning shell is thin enough , nuclear burning becomes unstable , as predicted by the instability criterion of kippenhahn & weigert ( 1990 ) ( see driebe et al .",
    "1999 for an application of this instability criterion in the context of cno flashes in hewds ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gravothermal and constant pressure specific heats respectively , @xmath31 is the adiabatic gradient , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the radial coordinate of the shell and @xmath35 its radial extent ( defined as the point at which nuclear burning falls below 0.001 of the maximum value ) .",
    "we find that this criterion is fulfilled in our models at the onset of pp flashes at @xmath3 8500k .",
    "in particular , this is because of the large values reached by the quantity @xmath36 , which exceeds 10 at the onset of the flash ; while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are close to 0.85 and 0.60 respectively .",
    "pp - induced flashes differ from their cno counterparts in some respects .",
    "for instance , in most cases pp flashes are less intense than the cno ones and during flash episodes convective mixing in the outer layers of the star is less frequent than for cno flashes .",
    "an interesting characteristic of these flashes is that after a pp hydrogen flash is initiated , the star is forced to move in the hr diagram following lines of almost constant radii close to the cooling track .",
    "also , during each of these pp flashes , the total amount of hydrogen in the star is barely reduced by nuclear burning with the result that the star in general will experience numerous episodes of this kind . in the sequences with",
    "@xmath0= 0.001 only those models which lack cno flashes experience pp hydrogen flashes , but they occur at extremely high ages .",
    "all of our sequences with @xmath0= 0.0002 are characterized by pp hydrogen flashes even if they have experienced cno flashes earlier in their evolution .",
    "the important point to emphasize here is that the pp flashes are induced by chemical diffusion that carries some hydrogen downwards deep enough for the star to ignite hydrogen there . except for the less massive models ( @xmath39 0.25 m@xmath1 ) , pp flashes in the sequences with @xmath0= 0.0002 take place between 2 and 4 gyr after the end of mass loss episodes . in general , the more massive the he wd , the earlier in the life of the star these pp flashes occur .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that the existence of such pp flashes in he wds is restricted to the case of metallicity much lower than the solar metallicity .",
    "for instance , such flashes are absent in the case of models with @xmath0= 0.02 , and only our 0.172 and 0.183 m@xmath1 models with @xmath0= 0.001 suffer from them .",
    "the fact that essentially models with extremely low metal content experience pp flashes can be understood on the basis that such models are left with hydrogen envelopes so massive that the tail of hydrogen distribution chemically diffusing inwards reaches hot enough layers .",
    "this increases the hydrogen burning by pp reactions and leads to a thermal instability .",
    "( @xmath0= 0.0002 ) . for more massive models ,",
    "spikes correspond to evolutionary stages during flash episodes .",
    "it is clear that models which experience unstable burning reach very low effective temperatures well within 15 gyr.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] -3.5 cm     ( @xmath0= 0.001 ) .",
    "spikes correspond to evolutionary stages during flash episodes . as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig.age02 ]  and  [ fig.age1 ] we show the effective temperature as a function of cooling age for the same stellar mass values as given in figs .  [ fig.tck02 ] and  [ fig.tck1 ] respectively .",
    "note that the lack of cno thermonuclear flashes in less massive models leads to a very slow rate of evolution , that is such models remain relatively bright even at very large ages .",
    "this is so because stable hydrogen shell burning via pp nuclear reactions constitutes the main source of luminosity over most of the entire evolution of these models . on the contrary",
    ", the existence of diffusion - induced cno thermonuclear flashes leads eventuallyto he wd models with hydrogen envelope masses small enough for nuclear burning not to appreciably contribute to the luminosity budget of the star .",
    "accordingly , such models are characterized by short evolutionary time - scales .",
    "this age dichotomy between models with and without cno flashes manifests also itself in cooling sequences with a solar metal content ( althaus et al .",
    "it is worth noting that such a dichotomy is less accentuated in the case of models with very low metal content . to place this assertion on a more quantitative basis , we mention that in reaching a value of teff= 8000  k , models with 0.219 , 0.243 , 0.280 and 0.319  m@xmath1 ( @xmath0= 0.0002 ) need about 10 , 8.7 , 3.1 and 2.3 gyr , respectively . in the case of @xmath0= 0.001 ,",

    "[ fig.nuc ] in which we show the time dependence of hydrogen burning luminosity for our 0.300  m@xmath1 sequences with @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 . in the case of @xmath0= 0.001 ,",
    "after 1.5 gyr of the occurrence of cno flashes , stable hydrogen burning reaches a maximum contribution to surface luminosity of 35% .",
    "afterwards , nuclear burning becomes less important as evolution proceeds .",
    "for instance , at 4 gyr , it only contributes less than 10% to the star s luminosity .",
    "in contrast , in the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 , stable nuclear burning contributes appreciably to surface luminosity even at an age of 6 gyr .",
    "after cno flashes , stable nuclear burning contributes more than 60% of the energy radiated by the star within the first 5 gyr .",
    "this contribution drops rather abruptly during the subsequent stages of evolution , eventually reaching 10% at 7 gyr . with regard to fig .",
    "[ fig.nuc ] , let us finally mention that we have also included the 0.197  m@xmath1 sequence ( @xmath0= 0.001 ) which does not suffer from flash episodes . in this case , the stellar luminosity is completely supported by stable hydrogen burning along the entire cooling branch , which is clearly shown in fig .

    "this behaviour can be understood on the basis of the role played by stable pp hydrogen burning after cno flash episodes .",
    "specifically , after experiencing only one cno flash , the 0.380 and 0.390  m@xmath1 models are left with a hydrogen envelope thin enough so as to inhibit the occurrence of another cno flash .",
    "however , envelopes are thick enough to mantain an appreciable amount of nuclear energy release through stable pp hydrogen burning , thus slowing the cooling rate at intermediate stages of evolution .",
    "finally , note the increase of the isochrone curves for the most massive sequence , which does not undergo any thermonuclear flash , thus resulting in comparatively large cooling ages .",
    "the situation for the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 sequences is qualitatively similar , though the age dichotomy is less noticeable and it is located at m@xmath41  m@xmath1 . as explained earlier , this is a result of the fact that , in this case , during flash episodes cno cycle reactions are less efficient than for higher metallicities and thus , hydrogen envelope is not so drastically consumed .    -.2",
    "cm = 0.001 .",
    "the abrupt drop shown by isochrones in the range 0.20 - 0.22  m@xmath1 is a consequence of the existence of a mass threshold for the occurrence of cno flashes .",
    "much shorter cooling ages result if the mass of the model is above this threshold value .",
    "the bump exhibited by the isochrones at @xmath3 0.38  m@xmath1 is related to an increase in the efficiency of pp stable nuclear burning at low ages . for more details , see text.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] -4.7 cm    -.2 cm   but for the case @xmath0= 0.0002 .",

    "the emergent spectrum becomes bluer and remains brighter than @xmath47 17 with subsequent cooling .",
    "a similar trend has been also found for the case of solar metallicity ( serenelli et al . 2001 ) , though in that situation he wds with stellar masses even as low as @xmath3 0.19  m@xmath1 reach high magnitude values .",

    "note that the six hewd candidates in ngc 6397 can be split into two groups .",
    "in particular , for the three brightest stars of the observed sequence , our evolutionary models fit the observational data quite well .",
    "we find that such he wds would be characterized by stellar mass values in the range 0.2 - 0.22  m@xmath1 , which is below the mass value for the occurrence of cno flashes .",
    "with regard to age determination , we find ages between 0.5 - 1.5  gyr for these stars .",
    "by contrast , the three dimmest stars appear to have larger radii even as compared with our least massive model ( @xmath50m@xmath1 ) , as it is clear from the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.col ] .",
    "we want to point out that , based on our mass loss treatment , we find a minimum mass value for the resulting he core remnant which is very close to 0.2 m@xmath1 for progenitors with @xmath0= 0.0002 .",
    "we have checked this by performing additional pre - wd calculations for different initial binary configurations . in this context ,",
    "burderi , dantona & burgay ( 2002 ) have also found that their evolutionary models have smaller radii than those required to fit the observational data .",
    "in addition , they also find a minimum mass limit of @xmath50m@xmath1 for hewds with very low metallicity progenitors .",
    "however , it is worth noting that our models are somewhat less compact than those presented by burderi et al .",
    "we judge that this difference could be a result of the fact that in our calculations we have included chemical element diffusion which leads to pure hydrogen envelopes and thus to models with larger radii ( althaus et al .",
    "2001a ) , thus reducing the discrepancy with observations .",
    "another point worthy of comment in connection with this second group of hewd candidates is related to their ages .",
    "indeed , our least massive sequence yields cooling ages between 10 and 15 gyr for these stars . value for the occurrence of cno thermonuclear flashes . ]",
    "if we take into account the time elapsed during the pre - wd evolution ( which is about 6 - 7  gyr for a 1  m@xmath1 progenitor ) , then the age of these stars would be in the range 16 - 21  gyr , larger than the age of the cluster , which is @xmath51  gyr ( anthony - twarog & twarog 2000 ) .",
    "this suggests that the progenitors of these hewd candidates should have been more massive than 1  m@xmath1 with , therefore , shorter pre - wd evolutionary ages . to explore this possibility",
    ", we have performed additional calculations with our mass loss prescription .",
    "for instance , we found that starting from a 1.4  m@xmath1 progenitor with a 1.4  m@xmath1 companion and an initial period of 0.5 days , the pre - wd evolution lasts for about 3  gyr and the mass of the wd remnant is 0.195  m@xmath1 .",
    "this would help to alleviate the age discrepancy mentioned above . in this regard ,",
    "we believe that a more comprehensive exploration of the binary nature leading to the formation of hewds , particularly for progenitors with very low metal content , is worth carrying out .    with regard to the he wd candidate in the globular cluster 47 tucanae",
    ", we find that our evolutionary models with @xmath0= 0.001 , a metallicity value not very different from that of 47 tucanae ( [ fe / h= -0.76 ] ) , yield a good agreement with observations for the @xmath43 index .",
    "in particular , we derive a stellar mass value of @xmath3 0.17  m@xmath1 and a cooling age of about 1.5 gyr for the wd .",
    "this age is consistent with the 2 gyr corresponding to the spin - down age of the millisecond pulsar companion to the wd ( edmonds et al .",
    "2001 and referenced cited therein ) .",
    "note that , as far as the @xmath44 index is concerned , we find no agreement with observational data .",
    "in fact , our evolutionary models are located too far to the blue .",
    "a lower stellar mass value ( m @xmath3 0.15 - 0.16  m@xmath1 ) than our lowest mass sequence would be needed to match the observed @xmath44 . in the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 and for the stellar masses we considered ,",
    "we find no agreement with observations for neither of the metallicities .    finally , we list in table  [ tab.z1 ] and  [ tab.z2 ] some colour indices for he wd models with , respectively , @xmath0= 0.0002 and @xmath0= 0.001 at selected effective temperature values .",
    "we also list the surface gravity ( @xmath52 ) , the age ( in gyr ) , the bolometric correction ( @xmath53 ) and the absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "in this study we have explored the evolution of helium - core white dwarf ( he wd ) stars with progenitors having much lower metallicities than the solar metallicity usually assumed in the modeling of these stars .",
    "the models presented here are appropriate for the interpretation of recent and future observations of low - mass wds in globular clusters .",
    "specifically , two low metallicity values have been considered : @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 . in the case of @xmath0= 0.0002 ,",
    "we have followed the evolution of he wd models with stellar masses of 0.199 , 0.209 , 0.219 , 0.225 , 0.243 , 0.266 , 0.280 , 0.300 and 0.319 m@xmath1 ; and for the case of @xmath0= 0.001 we considered 0.172 , 0.183 , 0.197 , 0.230 , 0.244 , 0.300 , 0.336 , 0.380 , 0.390 , 0.422 and 0.449 m@xmath1 .",
    "all of these models were evolved from the end of mass - loss phase down to very advanced phases of evolution .",
    "the binary nature of our he wd models has been simulated by abstracting mass from a 1 m@xmath1 model at appropriate stages of its evolution off the main sequence .",
    "specifically , to obtain physically sound initial low - mass he wd models , mass transfer rates were derived by imposing that the stellar radius remains close to the radius of the roche lobe .",
    "a fully non - conservative approach was assumed and the loss of angular momentum caused by gravitational wave emission as well as magnetic stellar wind braking have been taken into account .    the evolution of our he wd models has been computed in a self - consistent way with the predictions of time - dependent element diffusion and nuclear burning . a non - gray treatment for the atmosphere that considered the energy transfer by radiation and convection has been employed to derive the outer boundary conditions of our evolving models .",
    "models atmosphere are based on a detailed treatment of the microphysics entering the wd atmospheres , such as non - ideal effects in the equation of state ( as given by the occupation formalism of hummer & mihalas 1988 ) and the inclusion of hydrogen line ( from the balmer , lyman and paschen series ) and pseudo - continuum opacities .",
    "also , up - to - date collision - induced absorption data ( rohrmann et al . 2002 ) were incorporated in the computations .",
    "such a detailed description allowed us to provide a grid of accurate colour indices and magnitudes at both early and advanced evolutionary stages , strongly improving previous efforts ( serenelli et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "a feature worthy of comment predicted by our calculations is the existence of thermonuclear flash episodes for most of our he wd sequences . in part",
    ", this is a result of including in our computations the various chemical diffusion processes .",
    "we find that the lower the metallicity @xmath0 , the larger the minumum stellar mass for the occurrence of hydrogen thermonuclear flashes induced by the cno cycle reactions .",
    "specifically , for @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 we find a lower mass limit for the existence of cno flashes of @xmath54 0.22 and 0.26 m@xmath1 , respectively ( in the case of @xmath0= 0.02 such a limit becomes @xmath3 0.18 m@xmath1 ; see althaus et al .",
    "in addition , cno flashes become less intense as the metal content of the star is decreased and the mass range for the occurrence of such instabilities depends strongly on the inclusion of chemical diffusion processes in evolutionary calculations .",
    "we also find that the existence of a mass threshold for the occurrence of diffusion - induced cno flashes leads to an age dichotomy ( particularly for @xmath0= 0.001 ) between he wd models with and without cno thermonuclear flashes : he wds which do not experience cno thermonuclear flashes evolve very slowly , so they remain relatively bright even at very large ages , whilst those which suffer from such flashes are characterized by a fast cooling , reaching very low effective temperature stages within cooling times less than 15 gyr .",
    "such an age dichotomy is translated into distinctive features in the isochrone plots which could eventually be compared with observational expectations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that during the short - lived , cno diffusion - induced flashes , an appreciable amount of hydrogen is burnt , ultimately implying that the wd is left with a relatively thin hydrogen envelope which prevents stable hydrogen burning from being an important energy source at late cooling stages . as a result ,",
    "the star has a much lower amount of available energy , which implies much shorter evolutionary time scales as compared with the situation when cno flashes are absent .",
    "another finding of this work is related to the fact that some of our he wd models experience several episodes of thermal instabilities related to unstable hydrogen burning via the proton - proton ( pp ) nuclear reactions .",
    "these pp flashes , which take place at more advanced stages of evolution than those at which the cno flashes occur , are experienced by all of our sequences with @xmath0= 0.0002 .",
    "in addition , our 0.172 and 0.183 m@xmath1 models with @xmath0= 0.001 suffer from pp flashes , but at exceedingly high ages .",
    "we find that pp thermal instabilities are triggered by chemical diffusion that carries some hydrogen downwards deep enough for the star to ignite hydrogen there . except for the less massive models ( @xmath55 0.25 m@xmath1 ) ,",
    "pp flashes take place between 2 and 4 gyr after the end of mass loss episodes , and in general , the more massive the he wd , the earlier in the star life they occur .",
    "the evolution of our he wd models has also been analysed in the colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "we find that models which have suffered from cno flashes exhibit a turn - off in most of their colours at m@xmath2 16 .",
    "this turn - off , which results from the strong cia opacity by molecular hydrogen at low temperatures , is reached well within 15 gyr , mostly by he wds with @xmath0= 0.001 .",
    "finally , the predictions of our models for the colour - magnitude diagrams have been compared with recent observational data of he wd candidates in the globular clusters ngc 6397 and 47 tucanae ( taylor et al .",
    "2001 and edmonds et al .",
    "2001 , respectively ) . in this connection",
    ", we find that the three brightest hewd candidates in ngc 6397 can indeed be identified as hewds characterized by stellar mass values of 0.20 - 0.22  m@xmath1 ( which is below the mass value for the occurrence of cno flashes ) and ages ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 gyr .",
    "however , in the case of the three dimmest candidates , the agreement with observational data is not so evident as in the case of the brightest objects .",
    "indeed , our models appear to be more massive than required by observations .",
    "specifically , our mass - loss treatment gives rise to a minimum value of @xmath560.2  m@xmath1 an hewd may have from progenitors with initially @xmath0= 0.0002 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a @xmath57 would allow a very good agreement between theoretical predictions and observations . in this sense",
    ", it is remarkable that the quoted uncertainty in the case of the hewd candidate in 47 tucanae is very close to this value ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "finally the he wd in 47 tucanae is particularly relevant because the spin - down age of its millisecond pulsar companion yields a wd age estimate . specifically , the pulsar age of 2 gyr ( see edmonds et al .",
    "2001 ) is in agreement with the prediction of our @xmath0= 0.001 he wd sequences .",

    "<S> the present work is designed to explore the evolution of helium - core white dwarf ( he wd ) stars for the case of metallicities much lower than the solar metallicity ( @xmath0= 0.001 and @xmath0= 0.0002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> evolution is followed in a self - consistent way with the predictions of detailed and new non - grey model atmospheres , time - dependent element diffusion and the history of the white dwarf progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> reliable initial models for low mass he wds are obtained by applying mass loss rates to a 1 m@xmath1 stellar model in such a way that the stellar radius remains close to the roche lobe radius . the loss of angular momentun caused by gravitational wave emission and magnetic stellar wind braking are considered . </S>",
    "<S> model atmospheres , based on a detailed treatment of the microphysics entering the wd atmosphere ( such as the formalism of hummer - mihalas to deal with non - ideal effects ) as well as hydrogen line and pseudo - continuum opacities , enable us to provide accurate colours and magnitudes at both early and advanced evolutionary stages .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of our evolutionary sequences experience several episodes of hydrogen thermonuclear flashes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the lower the metallicity , the larger the minimum stellar mass for the occurrence of flashes induced by cno cycle reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a mass threshold for the occurrence of diffusion - induced cno flashes leads to a marked dichotomy in the age of our models . </S>",
    "<S> another finding of this study is that our he wd models experience unstable hydrogen burning via pp nuclear reactions at late cooling stages as a result of hydrogen chemically diffusing inwards . </S>",
    "<S> such pp flashes take place in models with very low metal content .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find that models experiencing cno flashes exhibit a pronounced turn - off in most of their colours at m@xmath2 16.finally , colour - magnitude diagrams for our models are presented and compared with recent observational data of he wd candidates in the globular clusters ngc 6397 and 47 tucanae .    </S>",
