    "in the past several decades , by accurately measuring the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , large - scale structures , supernovae and gravitational lensing , a simple standard cosmological model has been established and its parameters have been measured to a high precision . our universe is well described by a spatially flat , @xmath0 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with nearly scale - invariant , adiabatic and gaussian primordial fluctuations .",
    "but the high - precision measurements have revealed that only @xmath1 in the energy budget of the universe seems to be made of the ordinary atomic matter @xcite . in other words",
    ", the remaining @xmath2 seems to be composed of exotic dark components such as dark matter and dark energy .",
    "even though the standard cosmological model has been established , there are still many fundamental questions in cosmology .",
    "the remaining issues in cosmology would be as follow : what type of the inflationary model is actually realized in the very early universe ? what is the mechanism of generating primordial fluctuations ? what is the dark matter ? what is the physical origin of the cosmic acceleration , namely the dark energy or the modification of gravity theory ?",
    "although the cmb has been one of powerful observational tools for cosmology in the past decades , the next step towards a precision cosmology will require extra information .",
    "the future world s largest radio telescope , square kilometre array ( ska )  , will provide the three - dimensional information by measuring the large scale structure , and will be one of the most powerful tools for cosmology and play an important role in addressing these issues .    the purpose of this document is to introduce japanese scientific interests in the ska project and to report results of our investigation .",
    "it is still in progress , so that the document may not fully cover previous works related to the ska .",
    "we wish that the document becomes an interface for future communications , collaborations , and synergies with worldwide communities .",
    "inflation , which leads to an epoch of exponential expansion in the very early universe , was proposed as a solution to several problems in big bang cosmology , such as the horizon , flatness , and monopole problems .",
    "furthermore , it naturally sets the initial conditions required by the standard big bang cosmology . a promising way to access",
    "the very early stage of the universe is to measure the spatial pattern of the density fluctuation , because quantum fluctuations of fields during the inflationary epoch can seed the primordial density fluctuations and different inflationary models predict different amplitude and scale - dependence of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "hence observing density fluctuations provides us the rich information about not only the evolution of the late - time universe but also the primordial nature of the universe , namely the inflation models as a mechanism for generating primordial fluctuations .",
    "although in the standard cosmology the primordial fluctuations are assumed to be gaussian , recently possible small deviations from a purely gaussian primordial density fluctuations , so - called _ primordial non - gaussianity _ , have been investigated .",
    "since primordial non - gaussianity reflects the fundamental interactions and nonlinear processes involved during and/or immediately after the inflation , it can bring insights into the fundamental physics behind inflation .",
    "hence this is one of the most informative fingerprints of inflation and is more generally key to understanding the extremely high - energy physics . among the several types of primordial non - gaussianity , the local - type @xmath3 has been studied widely . to quantify primordial non - gaussianity of the local form we can parametrize the bardeen potential @xmath4 with a random gaussian field @xmath5 as  @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the ensemble average . if the distribution of density perturbations does not obey gaussian statistics , we rather need not only the power spectrum but also the higher - order statistics such as the bispectrum ( three - point functions ) .",
    "it has been shown that even the simplest inflationary models predict small but nonvanishing deviation from gaussianity ; @xmath3 of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity has primarily been constrained from the bispectrum in cmb temperature fluctuations and polarizations .",
    "recently , planck @xcite obtained a tight constraint of @xmath9 at @xmath10 statistical significance , implying that the inflationary models predicting too large @xmath3 were already ruled out .",
    "although current cmb experiments are already close to cosmic - variance - limited ones , it is still rather weak to distinguish the inflationary models . a complementary way to access primordial",
    "non - gaussianity is to measure its impact on large - scale structure . while galaxy surveys are expected to constrain @xmath3 to the level comparable to cmb anisotropies , the current constraint from the large - scale structure is about @xmath11 due to the unknown systematics  @xcite .",
    "in addition to primordial density fluctuations , inflation predicts the existence of primordial gravitational waves , or tensor perturbations , while there is no evidence of the presence of primordial gravitational waves yet . the odd - parity spatial pattern ( b - modes ) in the cmb polarization has been considered as a prime observation to probe primordial gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of tensor perturbations is conventionally parametrized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath12 , at a fiducial scale , and importantly the constraint on @xmath12 can be translated into the upper bound on the energy - scale of inflation .",
    "the constraint on the tensor - to - scalar ratio inferred from the current cmb observations is @xmath13 @xcite , which corresponds to the upper bound of the inflationary energy scale of @xmath14 .",
    "hence the detection and/or measurement of the signals generated by primordial gravitational waves offers an important clue to probe the extremely high - energy physics behind inflation .    while it is often claimed that inflationary models predict a spatially perfect flat geometry , investigating the nonvanishing spatial curvature as an extension to the standard cosmology is still theoretically of interest .",
    "the spatial curvature is not prohibited as the consequence of the inflation , and indeed large amount of negative spatial curvature @xcite can be introduced in the open inflation scenario , namely the inflationary model with bubble nucleation by false - vacuum decay  @xcite .",
    "this type of models is recently attracting a renewed attention in the context of the string landscape paradigm  @xcite .",
    "hence a search for the imprint of the false - vacuum decay in current / future observations such as cmb anisotropies is still very interesting .",
    "it is then shown that we are already testing the inflationary model with false - vacuum decay , which naturally predicts the spatially curved geometry , against observations  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the biggest challenges of modern cosmology to understand the physical origin of the cosmic acceleration of the universe , discovered by observations of supernovae  @xcite",
    ". it might eventually require the presence of a new type of matter , usually called dark energy .",
    "the simplest model for dark energy is a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , originally introduced by einstein a hundred years ago .",
    "however , in this model there is a theoretical problem , the so - called cosmological constant problem . based on naive arguments in quantum field theory ,",
    "the vacuum energy density due to the cosmological constant can be theoretically estimated from the sum of the contributions from quantum fields below an ultraviolet cutoff at the planck scale .",
    "on the other hand , cosmologically observed value is many orders of magnitude smaller than this theoretical estimates by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "so far it is still hard to naturally explain why such vanishingly small @xmath0 can be realized as a result of a cancellation of more than @xmath15 . as the alternative form of the dark energy , quintessence , more",
    "precisely a scalar field rolling down its potential , has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "unlike the cosmological constant , the quintessence is dynamic and the equation of state for the quintessence dark energy generally varies with time .    in another scenario ,",
    "the accelerated expansion might arise alternatively due to a modification of general relativity on cosmological scales , which is often referred as _ modified gravity theories_. in addition to the standard tensor modes , this type of models often involves a new degree of freedom that accounts for cosmic acceleration . among them , the simple modification is described by a scalar - tensor theory where a single scalar degree of freedom is added .",
    "a number of modified gravity theories consistent with current observations have been proposed so far as alternatives to dark energy .",
    "the @xmath16 gravity @xcite , dgp gravity @xcite , galileons @xcite , and massive gravity @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite for its extension ) are possible candidates to explain the cosmic acceleration due to the additional degree of freedom . moreover , a very general class of modified gravity theories , called horndeski theory @xcite and its extension @xcite , includes a large number of concrete models as specific cases . since modification of gravity",
    "are strongly constrained by precise tests of gravity on small scales such as one in the solar system , for a modified theory of gravity to be consistent , any of those involving an additional propagating degree of freedom must include a mechanism that suppresses any potential fifth force that might appear on small scales .",
    "a wide class of models can be shown to exhibit screening in the vicinity of a gravity source @xcite and some observational implications were suggested in @xcite .",
    "a variety of theoretical scenarios have been proposed in literature and need to be carefully compared with observational data .    to elucidate the nature of the dark energy and test gravity theory on cosmological scales , we need to introduce parameters to describe non - standard cosmological models .",
    "the simplest parametrization of background - level cosmological quantities is the equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter , which is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the spatially averaged background dark energy pressure and energy density . in the cosmological constant model , the eos parameter is @xmath20 , but if the dark energy is not a cosmological constant , @xmath21 , @xmath22 in general can vary in time . in order to test a time - varying eos , we for instance expand @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "the current constraints on @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been obtained from the combinations among data of cmb , supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillation and gravitational lensing and so on . at the moment , there is no evidence for a departure from the standard @xmath0cdm model  @xcite .",
    "however , we should note that since there are vast possibilities to model the landscape of models , there is no general framework to parametrize the eos parameter .",
    "hence more extensive studies of dark energy and modified gravity models are needed .",
    "we expect that investigating the deeper universe in future observations can help to break the degeneracy between dark energy and modified gravity .",
    "dark matter is crucial for the concordance cosmological model as a component which plays the central role in modeling of cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation in the universe .",
    "the growth of the large - scale structure is rather sensitive to the properties of the dark matter and neutrinos .",
    "current observations on large scales are in good agreement with the prediction from the standard cosmological model , based on the cold dark matter , which is the matter composed of particles with the free - streaming length much smaller than galaxy scales , and massless neutrinos .",
    "however , the concordance model should yet be tested with observations on smaller scale .    as a simple alternative to cdm , warm dark matter with its mass in the @xmath26 range has been proposed @xcite . while above the specific scales charactering its mass the behavior of warm dark matter is very similar to cdm and is indistinguishable from cdm , it erases density perturbations and drastically suppresses the power spectrum below this scale through its free streaming .",
    "on the other hand , the neutrino oscillation experiments by super kamiokande revealed that neutrinos must have small but nonvanishing masses , which indicates the existence of the physics beyond the standard model of the particle physics .",
    "so far only mass - squared difference of neutrinos have been measured  @xcite , suggesting that their masses are at least @xmath27 .",
    "massive neutrinos affect the evolution of the density perturbations and erases density perturbations through their free streaming .",
    "therefore , observing the small - scale power spectrum is of great interest not only for cosmology but also particle physics .",
    "observing the large - scale structure in the universe provides us the rich information about not only the late - time but also the primordial nature of the universe .",
    "however , a wide area of the sky and a significant redshift depth is essential to achieve the precision at and beyond cmb levels . among the next - generation cosmological experiments",
    ", the ska will be able to probe a vast volume of the universe and is expected to deliver the very precise cosmological measurements and lead to the new frontier of cosmology science . in this section , we briefly introduce major cosmology science partly developed by the international ska cosmology science working group , and partly presented in the international ska science book ( 2015 ) .",

    "the redshifting of hi ( @xmath49 cm ) line provides the redshift information of galaxies and helps to reconstruct the three - dimensional matter distributions over a range of redshifts and scales .",
    "this is called _ hi galaxy redshift survey_. however , the line is quite weak , we require highly sensitive telescopes such as the ska to perform large hi galaxy survey across a wide redshift range , while so far only galaxies up to @xmath50 have been detected in arecibo  @xcite .",
    "detection of a hi galaxy relies on the measurement of its corresponding hi line profile .",
    "the choice of source detection algorithm for the hi galaxy surveys is crucial and determines the total number of galaxies and how well spurious detections , e.g. , due to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , can be rejected . in the simple approach , which has been often studied ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite ) , we require that at least two points on the hi line are measured .",
    "this is because expected hi galaxies show the typical signals of the double peak due to their rotation and this method will remove any face - on galaxy showing a single narrow peak , which could be confused with rfi .",
    "based on this method , we expect that the hi galaxy redshift survey provided by ska has the potential to be competitive with other cosmological experiments in the next decade  @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath34 hours of survey time , the ska phase 1 ( ska1 ) covers @xmath51 out to @xmath52 , while ska phase 2 ( ska2 ) should probe the available full - sky , @xmath53 up to @xmath54 . for ska1 with flux sensitivity @xmath55jy , we will find about @xmath56 hi galaxies , which is slightly smaller than one expected in planed galaxy surveys in optical and infrared band , such as euclid   and lsst  .",
    "for comparison , the ska precursors , meerkat and askap , with the sky coverage @xmath51 and flux density @xmath57jy are expected to find @xmath58 galaxies .",
    "when the ska2 is constructed , the flux threshold will be drastically improved and can reach @xmath59jy over the available full - sky , providing that the spectroscopic survey of @xmath60 billion hi galaxies , that is , `` _ billion galaxy survey _ '' , can be delivered .",
    "yahya et al.(2015 ) shows that the number density and the bias for the hi galaxy survey conducted by the ska can be well described by the fitting function with several parameters depending on the flux cut .",
    "therefore , the ska cosmology survey will provide an unprecedented number of galaxies , compared with any planned galaxy surveys in 2020s .",
    "the ska hi galaxy survey in its both phase will be able to provide very accurate measurements for the expansion history of the universe via baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao )  @xcite , which is imprinted in the galaxy correlation function as the standard ruler , and the growth of structure via redshift space distortion ( rsd )  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the growth rate of the observed density contrast is sensitive to the dark energy models and the theory of gravity ( see sec .  [ sec : de ] ) .",
    "hence the precise rsd measurement then provides a test for deviations from general relativity on large scales .",
    "in addition to the hi galaxy redshift survey , the ska will be also able to deliver competitive cosmology by the _",
    "hi intensity mapping ( i m ) survey _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which offers novel technique of probing the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "for the hi galaxy survey , in order to detect individual galaxies , we indeed need sufficiently long integration time of the highly sensitive telescope . instead of resolving individual galaxies , the hi i m survey can measure the intensity of the integrated hi line emission of several galaxies in one angular pixel on the sky .",
    "for the ska , the pixel size is usually assumed to be @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "similar to the cmb map , the result of the hi i m survey is a map of large - scale fluctuations in hi intensity . by not requiring the detection of individual galaxies and combining with the high resolution of radio telescope , even for the ska1 , the hi i m survey can cover the extremely large survey volume that is larger than that of future planed ones .",
    "when the ska1-mid i m survey operating for @xmath34 hours with the bandwidth @xmath62 is considered , the ska1 can probe the available full - sky @xmath53 out to @xmath63 .",
    "we note that pushing to higher redshifts brings in issues of angular resolution and foreground , while the detection of i m at lowest redshifts is known to be difficult due to the rfi  @xcite . when the whole sample is assumed to be further subdivided into constant frequency bins of @xmath64 width , more than @xmath65 redshift bins can be used .",
    "even though individual galaxies are not detected , the hi i m survey has a sufficient potential to deliver precise measurements of the bao  @xcite and rsd  @xcite in the matter power spectrum even in the era of ska1 .",
    "these surveys provide powerful tests of dark energy and modifications to general relativity , which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : de ] .",
    "moreover , the very large survey volume provided by the hi i m survey provides us the possibility to probe the physics on extremely large - scales  @xcite , which carries the information of the possible signature of the primordial inflation in the very early universe ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : inflation ] ) .",
    "in addition to these , the hi i m survey could allow the measurements of the power spectrum for the lensing potential at higher redshifts  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , mainly because gravitational magnification due to weak gravitational lensing affects the clustering properties of galaxies .",
    "the radio weak lensing survey would map the dark matter distributions ( see sec.[sec : dm ] ) in the independent way from optical counterparts .    observing the hi signals emitted at the epoch of reionization ( eor )",
    "can also be used to deliver the very precise cosmology . during the eor , the first stars and galaxies release ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , creating ionized bubbles whose geometry reflects the large - scale clustering of the dark matter .",
    "since the hi gas survives not only inside galaxies in the ionized bubble but also in the neutral igm during the eor , a survey of the hi brightness temperature fluctuations can be treated as another biased tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution  @xcite , as with galaxy surveys .",
    "in addition , the hi i m survey before and during eor can also be used to measure the weak gravitational lensing of the redshifted hi emissions to reconstruct the high - redshift matter density fluctuations along the line - of - sight  @xcite .",
    "since the astrophysical processes during the eor are poorly understood and they lead to large uncertainties , a number of parameters to model the systematics should be included and the marginalization of the contributions from the astrophysical process is needed .",
    "furthermore , the hi signals are heavily contaminated by various sources such as our galaxy and extragalactic point sources .",
    "one of the important challenges for the hi i m survey is to develop the cleaning method to remove the foregrounds that are orders of magnitude stronger than the signals to be measured .",
    "although many works concerning the cleaning techniques have already been done , e.g. , @xcite ( see @xcite for the cmb foreground removal ) , it is still challenging to remove the everything that is not what we actually want to observe .",
    "although in the past decades the _ radio continuum survey _ has provided distribution of the large scale structure in low redshift , the studies from cosmological point - of - view has been restricted , e.g. the cross - correlations with the cmb to find the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) , mainly because the source density in radio continuum survey is relatively lower than that in ongoing optical surveys .",
    "when the ska is constructed , the radio continuum survey will be expected to provide a sufficient number of sources to be comparable to or relatively larger than expected in forthcoming surveys in other wavelength  @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation is emitted from all galaxies with ongoing star formation or accretion and dominates the extragalactic radio background emission in low frequency regime . moreover , since the synchrotron radio emission from galaxies is known to be unaffected by dust , the radio continuum survey is advantageous to detect high - redshift galaxies . because the semi - empirical extragalactic sky simulation performed in @xcite is so far in good agreement with latest radio observations such as jvla  @xcite , the resultant redshift distributions of various source populations with several detection thresholds can be used to forecast future constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , the radio continuum survey from ska will cover the available full - sky @xmath53 out to @xmath66 , which can probe extremely large survey volume . on the other hand ,",
    "since the radio continuum survey provides the featureless spectrum , the redshift information for individual galaxies is not available and can be obtained from other wavelength observations or hi line surveys .",
    "for instance , using observational data from optical surveys , the host galaxies of low - redshift radio sources will be expected to be identified , while radio sources at high redshifts , say @xmath67 , will not be identified by optical surveys  @xcite .",
    "the ska1 has the potential to perform a radio continuum survey over the available full - sky down to the flux threshold @xmath68 , which corresponds to the detection of @xmath69 galaxies .",
    "the ska2 with the flux limit @xmath70 can reach @xmath71 galaxies . in the absence of redshift information , the continuum survey mainly observes the angular power spectrum for the number density contrast of radio sources .",
    "even without redshift information for individual galaxies , the deep and wide surveys are advantageous to constrain the information of the primordial universe , e.g. , the primordial non - gaussianity ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : inflation ] ) , as shown in the following section .",
    "the radio continuum survey will also measure the deformation of the distant - galaxy images , providing the high - precision measurements of cosmic shear  @xcite .",
    "it directly offers an opportunity to probe intervening total matter fluctuations along a line - of - sight .",
    "the cosmic shear measurement of background source has been widely studied and now been accepted as a standard cosmological tool .",
    "the ska1 will survey @xmath51 and the ska2 can reach @xmath53 .",
    "we will find galaxy number densities of about @xmath72 galaxies per arcmin@xmath73 for ska1 and about @xmath74 galaxies per arcmin@xmath73 for ska2 .",
    "while the number of galaxies is relatively lower , the radio continuum survey can extend to higher redshift than the optical weak lensing surveys that will be conducted on comparable timescales .",
    "as introduced in the previous section , the ska has the potential to deliver the very precise cosmological measurements through the hi galaxy survey , hi intensity mapping survey and radio continuum survey .",
    "we expect that the cosmological survey conducted by the ska will yield transformational science across a wide range of cosmology . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the ska - oriented cosmological scientific challenges in which the cosmologists in japanese research community , called ska - japan consortium ( ska - jp ) cosmology science working group , have a deep interest .",
    "we have wide expertise in both theoretical / observational cosmologies and are particularly interested in the studies of the very early stage of the universe , the observational tests of the general relativity on cosmological scales and the particle physics such as the neutrinos and the beyond - standard - model physics . while observing the small - scale is of great interest from various perspectives for both cosmology and particle physics , it is hard to provide the accurate predictions on such scales , mainly because density perturbations grow significantly and enter within highly nonlinear regime .",
    "moreover , the feedback of the baryonic physics is poorly understood and involves large uncertainties . in order to obtain the unprecedented constraints on the parameters for the fundamental physics , we need to focus on the observation on the specific redshifts and scales .",
    "this section is a brief overview of the science that ska can achieve and our community is currently playing an important role .",
    "one of the possible ways to overcome the issues discussed above is to focus on the observations on the ultra - large cosmological scales .",
    "although it is hard to access ultra - large scales , theoretical prediction on such scales can be very precise , because in superhorizon scale , the growth of the density perturbation fully remains within the linear regime and the effects of the baryonic physics feedback due to the astrophysical processes are sufficiently suppressed .",
    "however , the clustering analysis at large scales are limited due to cosmic - variance , due to the lack of enough independent measurements . a promising way to access the ultra - large scales",
    "is to reduce the cosmic - variance with so - called multitracer technique  @xcite , in which the availability of multiple tracers with the different biases allows significant improvements in the statistical error .       as the function of the number of tracers in the single redshift bin @xmath75 .",
    "the mass bins are divided such that they have the equal shot noise .",
    "even @xmath76 tracers drastically improve the constraint , because the multitracer technique does not take effect for the one tracer case .",
    "@xcite , width=302 ]    among various cosmological parameters characterizing the primordial universe , we focus on the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "many members of japanese cosmology community have been extensively working on the inflationary model - building and the theoretical studies of the mechanism of generating the primordial non - gaussianity during the inflationary epoch .",
    "although primordial non - gaussianity has primarily been constrained from measurements of cmb so far , the resultant constraint has almost saturated to the observational limit predicted by ideal observations .",
    "large scale halo / galaxy distributions provide distinct information on the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "luminous sources such as galaxies must be most obvious tracers of the underlying dark matter distributions with a bias .",
    "for the standard gaussian initial conditions , the halo bias is often assumed to be linear , deterministic , and scale - independent .",
    "however , it was found that the non - gaussianity in primordial fluctuations effectively introduces a _ scale - dependent _ clustering of galaxies on large scales .",
    "the modification appears in a biased tracer of the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the non - gaussian correction to the large - scale gaussian bias of a biased tracer , induced by the local - type non - gaussianity @xmath3 , is given by  @xcite .",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the growth factor and @xmath80 is the matter transfer function normalized to unity at large scales . the effect of the local type primordial non - gaussianity on the halo bias is prominent on large scales and at high redshifts .",
    "thus , in the large - scale limit , the non - gaussian correction become dominant , and the enhancement of clustering amplitude becomes significant . with the help of this property , the constraint on primordial",
    "non - gaussianity has been obtained ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .     for each survey and combinations .",
    "constraints @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be obtained with a single survey of ska1 and euclid , respectively .",
    "the combination of ska and euclid can provide a stronger constraint @xmath83 for ska1+euclid and an unprecedented constraint @xmath84 for ska2+euclid .",

    "hereafter we assume that the stochastic part of the halo clustering can be approximately described by the diagonal shot noise given by one over the number density , while the numerical simulation  @xcite has suggested small deviations from this description . before showing expected constraints from ska , the specific galaxy survey with single redshift bin @xmath75 , the sky coverage @xmath85 and the observed halo mass range @xmath86 is considered to investigate the efficiency of the multitracer technique .",

    "[ sec : rc ] ) . in our treatment , the specific population of galaxies is considered to match the extragalactic simulation performed in wilman et al.(2008 ) . assuming that the sensitivity limit of @xmath89 and applying a @xmath90 detection for ska1(2 ) . in this case",
    ", they correspond to the detection of @xmath91 and @xmath71 galaxies , respectively .",
    "moreover , to split the galaxy samples into the subsamples by the inferred halo mass and redshift , five radio galaxy types such as star - forming galaxies , radio quite quasars , radio - loud agn and starbursts are considered to infer the halo mass .",
    "we actually have shown that the ska radio continuum survey can constrain up to the accuracy of @xmath92 for ska2 , and @xmath93 for ska1 .",
    "even when the gr horizon - scale effects are taken into account , it is shown that @xmath94 can be achieved  @xcite .    at the time when the ska is operational ,",
    "there will be additional survey from a number of ground - based telescopes and space missions .",
    "euclid is expected to be launched in 2020 and will perform imaging and spectroscopic surveys in optical and infrared bands . while the number of galaxies ( @xmath95 ) and covered sky area ( @xmath96 ) for euclid are relatively smaller than these for ska , we consider euclid photometric galaxy survey as a future representative survey that will be conducted on comparable time scales .",

    "the growth of the density fluctuations depends on cosmological parameters , and we can use the 21 cm line surveys for constraining them like cmb observations or galaxy surveys .",

    "these features are advantages of the 21 cm line surveys .    in a work studied by k.  kohri , y.  oyama , t.  sekiguchi , t.  takahashi , who are members of ska - jp ( kohri et al . , 2013 )",

    "the japanese astronomical researchers are currently leading cosmology - oriented surveys in other wavelengths such as hsc and litebird , and participating in ongoing and upcoming experiments . by working with members of these surveys , the japanese community has the potential to provide the powerful tools for cosmology in next decade .",
    "the involvement of ska - jp in the ska will benefit our community by enlarging their expertise in cosmology science .",
    "the authors are grateful to international ska cosmology science working group members for providing us opportunities of open discussion and cooperation .",

    "<S> in the past several decades , the standard cosmological model has been established and its parameters have been measured to a high precision , while there are still many of the fundamental questions in cosmology ; such as the physics in the very early universe , the origin of the cosmic acceleration and the nature of the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the future world s largest radio telescope , square kilometre array ( ska ) , will be able to open the new frontier of cosmology and will be one of the most powerful tools for cosmology in the next decade . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological surveys conducted by the ska would have the potential not only to answer these fundamental questions but also deliver the precision cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> in this article we briefly review the role of the ska from the view point of the modern cosmology . the cosmology science led by the ska - japan consortium ( ska - jp ) cosmology science working group </S>",
    "<S> is also discussed . </S>"
