    "computer aided diagnosis ( cadx ) has been widely used for characterization of breast lesions based on dynamic contrast - enhanced magnetic resonance images ( dce - mris ) .",
    "traditional cadx systems automatically segment a lesion from the neighboring background and subsequently extract intuitive hand - crafted features that describe its size , shape , enhancement , or kinetics ^1 - 5^. once the features are extracted , they are used to build classification models to make diagnostic decisions ( e.g. likelihood of malignancy , molecular characteristics ) . despite the success of cadx predictive models , dce - mri cadx faces many challenges , one being the heterogeneity within the mr image data .",
    "one of the sources of the data instability comes from the variability of mr magnet strength .",
    "currently , clinical breast imaging is performed with 1.5 tesla ( t ) or 3 t mr scanners .",
    "the magnet strength has an effect on image quality , with lower strength scanners producing images with higher noise and lower resolution , leading to less resolved anatomical details ^6^. thus , cadx features may vary with the mri magnet strength .",
    "unfortunately , currently available medical image datasets are of limited sizes . separating the dce - mri data based on magnet strength",
    "is undesirable since it would further decrease the dataset sizes .",
    "the goal of this work is to search for a generalizable predictive model that will allow for incorporation of both 1.5 t and 3 t data .",
    "we hypothesize that despite the described differences , there exist underlying relationships between features extracted from images acquired with 1.5 t and 3 t scanners .",
    "based on this assumption , we explore multi - task learning ( mtl ) to generalize discrimination of malignant and benign lesions over different feature domains .",
    "the approach assumes that there exists relatedness between the different - domain features , which is utilized to improve the classification performance .",
    "assessment of the mtl method was performed on 1.5 t and 3 t dce - mri datasets of 447 and 193 breast lesions , respectively ( table  [ dataset - table ] ) .",
    "the dce - mr images were acquired at the university of chicago medical center over a span of 6 years from 2006 to 2012 on either 1.5 t or 3 t philips scanners with t1-weighted spoiled gradient sequence .",
    "each lesion was characterized as benign or malignant based on pathology from biopsy .",
    "examples of 1.5 t and 3 t images of cancerous lesions are shown in figure 1 .",
    "[ dataset - table ]    .the number of cases in 1.5 t , 3 t and merged ( 1.5t+3 t ) datasets .",
    "the table includes image resolution in each dataset .",
    "the resolution varies drastically between specific - magnet - strength datasets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "table  [ sample - table ] summarizes performance metrics for the mtl and svm classifiers , while varying the decision boundary .",
    "compared to the svm classification , the mtl model results in higher positive ( ppv ) and negative ( npv ) predictive values and therefore , it has more correct than incorrect identifications of benign and malignant lesions .",
    "specificity values are higher for the mtl model , indicating reduction of false positive predictions .",
    "we conclude that mtl has higher performance than svm classifier with the resulting cross - validated auc values of @xmath0= 0.90 ( standard error ( se ) = 0.01 ) and @xmath1 = 0.88 ( se = 0.01 ) , for mtl and svm classifiers , respectively .",
