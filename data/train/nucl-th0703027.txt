    "a large volume of experimental data from au+au collisions at rhic are successfully analysed in an _ ideal _ fluid dynamic model @xcite",
    ". however , experimental data do show deviation from ideal behavior .",
    "the ideal fluid description works well in almost central au+au collisions near mid - rapidity at top rhic energy , but gradually breaks down in more peripheral collisions , at forward rapidity , or at lower collision energies @xcite , indicating the onset of dissipative effects . to describe such deviations from ideal fluid dynamics , quantitatively , requires the numerical implementation of _ dissipative _ relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "though the theories of dissipative hydrodynamics @xcite has been known for more than 30 years , significant progress towards its numerical implementation has only been made very recently @xcite . in the following",
    ", i will briefly review the phenomenological theory of dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "some numerical results comparing the ideal and 1st order dissipative hydrodynamics , obtained using the computer code azhydro - kolkata @xcite will be shown .",
    "in this section , i briefly discuss the phenomenological theory of dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "more detailed exposition can be found in @xcite .    a simple fluid , in an arbitrary state , is fully specified by primary variables : particle current ( @xmath0 ) , energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath1 ) and entropy current ( @xmath2 ) and a number of additional ( unknown ) variables .",
    "primary variables satisfies the conservation laws ;    @xmath3    and the 2nd law of thermodynamics ,    @xmath4    in relativistic fluid dynamics , one defines a time - like hydrodynamic 4-velocity , @xmath5 ( normalised as @xmath6 ) .",
    "one also define a projector , @xmath7 , orthogonal to the 4-velocity ( @xmath8 ) . in equilibrium ,",
    "an unique 4-velocity ( @xmath5 ) exists such that the particle density ( @xmath9 ) , energy density ( @xmath10 ) and the entropy density ( @xmath11 ) can be obtained from ,    @xmath12    an equilibrium state is assumed to be fully specified by 5-parameters , @xmath13 or equivalently by the thermal potential , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the chemical potential ) and inverse 4-temperature , @xmath16 .",
    "given a equation of state , @xmath17 , pressure @xmath18 can be obtained from the generalised thermodynamic relation ,    @xmath19    using the gibbs - duhem relation , @xmath20 , following relations can be established on the equilibrium hyper - surface @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    in a non - equilibrium system , no 4-velocity can be found such that eqs.[eq4a],[eq4b],[eq4c ] remain valid .",
    "tensor decomposition leads to additional terms ,    @xmath23+\\pi\\delta^{\\mu\\nu } + \\pi^{\\mu\\nu } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( w^\\mu u^\\nu + w^\\nu u^\\mu)\\\\ s^\\mu=&&s^\\mu_{eq}+\\delta s^\\mu = su^\\mu + \\phi^\\mu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the new terms describe a net flow of charge @xmath24 , heat flow , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the heat flow vector ) , and entropy flow @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the bulk viscous pressure and @xmath29t_{\\sigma\\tau}$ ] is the shear stress tensor .",
    "hydrodynamic 4-velocity can be chosen to eliminate either @xmath30 ( the eckart frame , @xmath5 is parallel to particle flow ) or the heat flow @xmath26 ( the landau frame , @xmath5 is parallel to energy flow ) . in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "landau s frame is more appropriate than the eckart s frame .",
    "dissipative flows are transverse to @xmath5 and additionally , shear stress tensor is traceless .",
    "thus a non - equilibrium state require 1 + 3 + 5=9 additional quantities , the dissipative flows @xmath31 , @xmath26 ( or @xmath30 ) and @xmath32 . in kinetic theory , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are 1st and 2nd moment of the distribution function .",
    "unless the function is known a - priori , two moments do not furnish enough information to enumerate the microscopic states required to determine @xmath2 , and in an arbitrary non - equilibrium state , no relation exists between , @xmath33 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "_ only in a state , close to a equilibrium one , such a relation can be established_. assuming that the equilibrium relation eq.[eq7 ] remains valid in a `` near equilibrium state '' also , the entropy current can be generalised as ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is an undetermined quantity in 2nd order in deviations , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "detail form of @xmath35 is constrained by the 2nd law @xmath38 . with the help of conservation laws and gibbs - duhem relation ,",
    "entropy production rate can be written as ,    @xmath39    choice of @xmath35 leads to 1st order or 2nd order theories of dissipative hydrodynamics . in 1st order theories @xmath40 , entropy current contains terms upto 1st order in deviations , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    ", causality is violated .",
    "if , in a given fluid cell , at a certain time , thermodynamic forces vanish , corresponding dissipative fluxes also vanish instantly .",
    "this is corrected in 2nd order theories @xcite where entropy current contain terms upto 2nd order in the deviations , @xmath51 .",
    "the most general @xmath35 containing terms upto 2nd order in deviations can be written as ,    @xmath52    as before , one can cast the entropy production rate ( @xmath53 ) in the form of eq.[eq213 ] . neglecting the terms involving dissipative flows with gradients of equilibrium thermodynamic quantities (",
    "both are assumed to be small ) and demanding that a linear relation exists between the dissipative flows and thermodynamic forces , following _ relaxation _ equations for the dissipative flows can be obtained ,    @xmath54\\\\ \\pi^{\\mu\\nu}=&&2\\eta \\left[\\nabla^{<\\mu}u^{\\nu > } -\\beta_2 d\\pi_{\\mu\\nu } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55is the convective time derivative . unlike in the 1st order theories , in 2nd order theories , dynamical equations controls the dissipative flows . even if thermodynamic forces vanish , dissipative flows donot vanish instantly .",

    "before we proceed further , it may be mentioned that the parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not connected to the actual state ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath18 in eq.[eq11 ] is also not the `` actual '' thermodynamics pressure , i.e. not the work done in an isentropic expansion .",
    "chemical potential @xmath56 and 4-inverse temperature @xmath57 has meaning only for the equilibrium state .",
    "their meaning need not be extended to non - equilibrium states also . however , it is possible to define a fictitious `` local equilibrium '' state , point by point , such that pressure @xmath18 in eq.[eq11 ] can be identified with the thermodynamic pressure , at least upto 1st order . in 2nd order in deviations ,",
    "such an identification is not possible .     plane . ]",
    "numerically , causal dissipative hydrodynamics is a challenging problem .",
    "one needs to solve simultaneously 14 partial differential equations(5 conservation equations and 9 additional equations for the dissipative flows : , @xmath31 , @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "recently , at the cyclotron centre , kolkata , we have developed a code for solving causal dissipative hydrodynamics with dissipation due to shear viscosity only , in 1 + 1 dimension @xcite ( assuming boost - invariance and cylindrical symmetry ) and presently extending the code in 2 + 1 dimensions ( with boost - invariance only ) .",
    "we have completed the coding for the 1st order theory . here , we present some numerical results .    assuming boost - invariance , we have solved 1st order viscous hydrodynamics for initial state qgp in 2 + 1 dimension , in @xmath59 coordinate .",
    "we restrict ourselves to central rapidity region , where the qgp fluid is essentially baryon free and to keep the calculations simple , we consider the most important dissipative term , the shear viscosity and neglect the other dissipative terms , e.g. heat conduction , bulk viscosity . for viscosity ,",
    "we have used two values , the ads / cft motivated value @xmath60=0.08 , and the perturbative estimate @xmath60=0.135 .",
    "details of the equations solved can be found in @xcite .",
    "we just mention that we have used the equation of state , eos - q , developed in ref.@xcite , with 1st order phase transition with critical temperature @xmath61=164 mev . as mentioned earlier , 1st order dissipative hydrodynamics violate causality and can lead to unphysical effects like early reheating .",
    "but for qgp fluid , which is close to an ideal fluid , such effects can be minimised with appropriate initial conditions , and we did not find any evidence of early reheating .      in the following we will show the results obtain in au+au collision at impact parameter @xmath62 6.8 fm , which approximately corresponds to 16 - 24% centrality au+au collisions . with the same initial conditions , we have solved the energy - momentum conservation equations for ideal fluid and viscous fluid . in fig.[f1 ] , we have shown the constant energy density contour plot in x - y plane , after an evolution of 5 fm .",
    "the black lines are for ideal fluid evolution .",
    "the red and blue lines are for viscous fluid with @xmath60=0.08 and 0.135 respectively . in fig.[f3 ] , contour plot of temperature in x-@xmath63 plane is shown .",

    "viscosity influences the particle production by ( i ) extending the freeze - out surface and ( ii ) by introducing a correction to the equilibrium distribution function ( see @xcite ) . in fig.[f7 ] , transverse momentum distribution of @xmath64 from ideal and viscous hydrodynamics are compared .",
    "freeze - out temperature is @xmath65=0.158 gev .",

    "effect of viscosity is also prominent on elliptic flow ( fig.[f9 ] ) . in ideal dynamics",
    ", elliptic flow continues to increase with @xmath66 . in viscous dynamics , on the otherhand , elliptic flow tends to saturate .",
    "the result is very encouraging , as experimentally also elliptic flow tends to saturate at large @xmath66 .",
    "lastly , in fig.[f10 ] , we have shown a comparison of @xmath66 spectra obtained in ideal hydrodynamics with initial entropy density @xmath67=110 @xmath68 with @xmath66 spectra obtained in viscous hydrodynamics obtained with initial entropy density , 60,80 and 110 .",
    "@xmath66 spectra from viscous fluid initialised with @xmath67=60 - 80 compare well with the spectra from ideal fluid , initialised at higher entropy density .",

    "we have briefly reviewed the phenomenological theory of dissipative hydrodynamics and presented some numerical results from 1st order dissipative hydrodynamic of qgp fluid with only shear viscosity .",
    "1st order theories suffer from the problem of causality , signal can travel faster than light .",
    "unphysical effects like reheating of the fluid , early in the evolution , can occur . in this model study , we have considered two values of viscosity , the ads / cft motivated value , @xmath690.08 and perturbatively estimated viscosity , @xmath690.135 .",

    "transverse expansion is also more in viscous dynamics .",
    "we have also studied the effect of viscosity on particle production .",
    "viscosity generates entropy leading to enhanced particle production .",

    "estimate of viscosity , elliptic flow is reduced by a factor of 2(3 ) .",
    "we also find that at large @xmath66 elliptic flow tends to saturate .    to conclude , present study shows viscosity , even if small , can be very important in analysis of rhic au+au collisions .",
    "currently accepted initial temperature of hot dense matter produced in rhic au+au collisions , obtained from ideal fluid analysis can be changed by 20% or more with dissipative dynamics .",
