    "the currently accepted model for gamma - ray burst phenomena involves the violent formation of a rapidly rotating approximately solar - mass black hole surrounded by a similarly massive debris torus @xcite .",
    "a gravitational - wave burst is likely to be associated with the formation of this `` central engine , '' and the observation of such a gravitational - wave burst may reveal details of the central engine that can not be revealed through observations of the gamma rays alone . in this paper",
    "we examine how joint observations from the ligo gravitational - wave detectors @xcite and the swift gamma - ray burst satellite @xcite can be used to detect or place upper limits on gravitational - wave emission by gamma - ray burst events .",
    "finn , mohanty , and romano @xcite have described how the cross - correlated output of two gravitational - wave detectors , taken in coincidence with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) events , can be used to detect or place upper limits on the emission of gravitational - wave bursts ( gwbs ) by grbs .",
    "finn et al .",
    "estimate that 1000 grb observations combined with observations from the initial ligo detectors could produce an upper limit on the gravitational - wave strain associated with grbs of approximately @xmath0 at 95% confidence .    in their original work finn",
    "et al .   assumed that grbs would be detected isotropically ; i.e. , that the grb detector had an isotropic antenna pattern . they did note , however , that the swift satellite @xcite , a next - generation multi - wavelength satellite dedicated to the study of grbs , does not have an isotropic antenna pattern and that this has potentially important consequences for the ability of the combined grb / gwb detector array to detect or limit the gravitational - wave flux on earth owing to grbs . here",
    "we study this question specifically in the context of the swift satellite and the ligo gravitational - wave detectors ; i.e. ,  we determine , as a function of swift s pointing , the sensitivity of the swift / ligo detector array to gravitational waves from grbs , and propose a figure - of - merit that can be used in swift mission scheduling to optimize the sensitivity of the swift / ligo array to the gravitational - wave flux from grbs .",
    "we find that the upper limit that can be placed on @xmath1 differs by a factor of 2 between best and worst orientations of the satellite .",
    "we begin in section  2 with a review of how one can detect place upper limits on the gravitational - wave strength associated with grbs . in section  3",
    "we extract the direction dependence of this upper limit and apply to the case of swift .",
    "we conclude with some brief remarks in section  4 .",
    "in this section we briefly review the analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "consider a set of @xmath2 grb detections , each characterized by the direction to the source @xmath3 and the arrival time @xmath4 of the burst at earth s barycenter .",
    "a plane gravitational wave incident on the detector pair from the direction @xmath3 will lead to correlated detector responses with a time lag equal to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the arrival time of the burst at detector @xmath7 , which depends only on @xmath8 , @xmath3 , and the detector location .",
    "let @xmath9 be the output of gravitational wave detector @xmath10 , which we assume to consist of detector noise @xmath11 and a possible gravitational wave signal @xmath12 produced by the grb source : @xmath13 finn et al .",
    "@xcite define @xmath14 as the energy in the cross - correlation of the two detectors corresponding to the grb characterized by @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is a freely specifiable symmetric filter function , and @xmath17 is chosen large enough to encompass the range of possible times by which the gravitational waves from a grb event may precede the gamma rays , which is typically thought to be of order 1 s for grbs produced by internal shocks and 100 s for grbs produced by external shocks @xcite .",
    "the presence of a gwb in the data will increase the mean value of the cross - correlation ( [ eq : cross ] ) over its mean value when no gwbs are present .",
    "finn et al .",
    "@xcite showed that this effect can be used to detect or place upper limits on the gravitational - wave strain associated with grbs by comparing the mean value @xmath18 of the cross - correlation statistic for a set of grb observations to the mean cross - correlation @xmath19 computed using random @xmath20 not associated with any grb .",
    "the expected difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is simply the contribution due to gwbs from the grb events ; using ( [ eq : s ] ) , we have @xmath21 where the overline denotes an average over the population of grbs . since the right - hand side of ( [ eq : hcross ] ) is quadratic in the gravitational - wave strain , a measurement of or limit on the difference in cross - correlations leads directly to an estimate of or upper limit on the gravitational - wave strain associated with grbs .",
    "here we are not interested in the absolute value of the upper limit that can be achieved , but rather in how that upper limit varies according to the relative orientation of the gwb / grb detector array .",
    "we shall extract this dependence in the next section .",
    "the analysis described in @xcite assumed that the arms of the two ligo gravitational - wave detectors all reside in the same plane , that pairs of arms are parallel to each other , and that the antenna pattern of the detectors is isotropic on the sky . in this section",
    "we relax all of these approximations ; i.e. , we properly account for the position and orientation of the two ligo detectors on the earth and the dependence of their sensitivity to the direction to the grb source .",
    "our result is an expression for the dependence of the upper limit on the population - averaged gravitational - wave strength @xmath22 as a function of the distribution of _ detected _ grbs on the sky .",
    "we also combine this result with the directional sensitivity of the swift detector to determine the dependence on swift pointing of the upper limit on @xmath22 that can be set by joint ligo / swift observations .",
    "the gravitational - wave component @xmath23 of the ligo detector output is a linear function of the physical gravitational - wave strain @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational - wave detector s location and @xmath27 is the detector response function . for interferometer @xmath7 with arms pointing in the directions @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,",
    "the latter is @xmath30    it is convenient to decompose the gravitational wave into its two polarization states , @xmath31 see @xcite for one choice of the polarization tensors @xmath32 .",
    "lacking any detailed model for the gravitational waves that may be produced in a grb event , we assume that ( i ) the waves have equal power in the two polarizations ( @xmath33 ) and ( ii ) the two polarizations are uncorrelated ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "focus attention now on the mean gravitational - wave contribution @xmath22 to the cross - correlation statistic ( [ eq : cross ] ) . for gwbs arriving from the direction @xmath35",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath36 where @xmath37 describes the direction - dependence of the sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detector pair to the gwb .    to complete the evaluation of @xmath22 consider to the fraction of grb detections that arise from different patches on the sky .",
    "since the intrinsic grb population is isotropic , the distribution of detection on the sky depends entirely on the directional sensitivity of the grb detector .",
    "let the fraction of grb detections in a sky patch of area @xmath38 centered at @xmath35 be given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the direction in which the grb detector is pointed , and @xmath41 describes the rotation of the satellite about its pointing direction .",
    "it can then be shown that the upper limit on the squared gravitational - wave strain averaged over the observed grb population when the orientation of gwb and the grb detectors are given by @xmath42 is inversely proportional to @xmath43    clearly @xmath44 can be regarded as a figure of merit that describes how capable the gravitational - wave / gamma - ray burst detector combination is at identifying gwbs associated with grbs as a function of the detector orientations .",
    "this figure of merit may be normalized to have a maximum of unity ; however , regardless of the normalization @xmath45 is the ratio of the upper limits on the squared gravitational - wave amplitude that can be attained by orienting the grb satellite as @xmath46 versus @xmath47 . to the extent that , e.g.",
    ", the grb detector orientation @xmath46 can be manipulated on orbit , choosing orientations that maximize @xmath44 will lead to larger signal contributions ( [ eq : hcross ] ) to the cross - correlation and thus more sensitive measurements of the gravitational - wave strength associated with grbs .",
    "let us now consider the special case of the burst - alert telescope ( bat ) on the swift satellite @xcite and the ligo gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the bat is a wide field - of - view coded - aperture gamma - ray imager that will detect and locate grbs with arc - minute positional accuracy .",
    "its sensitivity to grbs depends on the the angle @xmath48 between the line of sight to the grb and the bat axis , as well as the rotational orientation of the satellite about the bat axis .",
    "averaged over this azimuthal angle , the bat sensitivity as a function of @xmath48 is approximately @xmath49 } &            \\lambda \\in [ 0,\\pi/3 ] \\ , , \\\\           0 & \\mbox{otherwise } \\ , .",
    "\\end{array }       \\right.\\ ] ] for the purposes of illustration we will use this azimuthal - angle averaged expression for the bat sensitivity .",
    "convolving @xmath50 ( [ eq : rholigo ] ) for the ligo detector array ( see @xcite ) with the swift sensitivity function @xmath51 as in equation ( [ eq : fom ] ) gives the figure of merit @xmath44 for the swift pointing , which is shown in figure  [ fig : fom ] .",
    "the figure of merit is nowhere zero , varying by a factor of approximately 4 between best ( near zenith of detectors ) and worst ( near planes of detectors at 45 degrees from arms ) orientations of swift ; this translates into a factor 2 difference in amplitude sensitivity .",
    "the all - sky average of the figure of merit is 0.56 times the maximum value .",
    "in this article , we have evaluated how the quality of an upper limit on the gravitational - wave strength associated with gamma - ray burst observations depends on the relative orientation of the gamma - ray burst and gravitational - wave detectors , with particular application to the swift burst - alert telescope ( bat ) and the ligo gravitational wave detectors .",
    "setting aside other physical and science constraints on the swift mission , careful choice of bat pointing leads to an upper limit on the observed grb population - averaged mean - square gravitational - wave strength a factor of two lower than the upper limit resulting from pointing that does not take this science into account .",
