    "a key issue as regards the nature of the universe is how the smooth expanding large - scale universe is constructed from small - scale extremely inhomogeneous domains that are essentially static .",
    "the space - time in the solar system for example is static to a very good approximation , but it is very inhomogeneous ( @xmath0 ) . how can one construct an expanding universe solution by gluing together large numbers of such quasi - static domains ?",
    "the static space - time regions representing local masses and the vacuum regions around stars are of course structured into galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and large scale structures such as walls and voids ; the same essential problem arises if we consider how they in turn can be assembled into an expanding universe . for simplicity and analytic clarity",
    ", we will assume that :    1 .",
    "the component massive entities are exactly spherically symmetric ; 2 .   these entities , whether we think of them as stars , galaxies , or galaxy clusters , are embedded in an exact vacuum solution of the einstein field equations ( possibly with a non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath1 ) ; 3 .",
    "they are far enough apart from each other that the vacuum space - time around each of them is also locally spherically symmetric .    given the assumption of local spherical symmetry around each mass , it is crucial that birkhoff s theorem @xcite will apply : + 4",
    ". the vacuum solution around each mass will necessarily be locally static .",
    "+ thus we do not have to assume local staticity which follows from the other previous assumptions .",
    "the local exterior space - time ( outside the massive entities ) will thus locally be either a schwarzschild solution ( if @xmath2 ) or a kottler solution ( if @xmath3 ) .",
    "so we can ask : how can one join exact schwarzschild or kottler solutions together to form an expanding universe ?",
    "this issue was tackled in a very innovative paper by lindquist and wheeler a long time ago  @xcite , using a schwarzschild cell method to model an expanding universe with closed spatial sections ( having the topology of a 3-sphere , @xmath4 ) . for simplicity",
    ", they used a regular lattice , which allows a very limited set of possibilities . considering @xmath5 vertices ,",
    "they state that  every vertex can be equidistant from its neighbours only when @xmath6 or @xmath7 \" , which corresponds to the most homogeneous topologies of the 3-sphere  @xcite .",
    "they then derived equations of motion for the expanding universe from junction conditions between the cells .",
    "this work has been recently revisited in an interesting way in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this approach is quite different conceptually from the commonly used  swiss - cheese \" construction  @xcite . in that case , one _ starts off _ with a friedmann - lematre spatially homogeneous and isotropic geometry , and then cuts out spherical  vacuoles \" within which individual masses are embedded .",
    "these masses are thus contained in vacua within a spatially homogeneous fluid - filled cosmos . in the lindquist - wheeler approach on the other hand ,",
    "one starts off with the inhomogeneous vacuoles alone , and then glues them together to construct an emergent friedmann - lematre geometry when averaged on large scales .",
    "there is no fluid filling the space - time ; rather ( as in the case of kinetic theory ) fluid - like behaviour emerges on large scales when one coarse - grains over the detailed structure .",
    "this is a far more fundamental approach to the study of the relation between locally static inhomogeneity and a globally expanding universe .",
    "however , this method is not strictly self - consistent in that the gravitational fields of the neighboring particles would in fact deform the field in the neighborhood of each cell s vertex , thereby resulting in an approximate rather than exact spherically symmetric space - time region ( the real solution will be locally a bit anisotropic about each vertex ) .",
    "nevertheless it is an acceptable approximation , and is a very useful approach to tackle the issue raised here .      in order to understand the situation better , we investigate the simplest possible such solution with isolated spherically symmetric massive objects embedded in a vacuum with @xmath4 spatial topology : namely the case with @xmath8 , which lindquist and wheeler did not consider  @xcite . with the two masses at antipodal points of the spatial sections ,",
    "the space - time remains exactly spherically symmetric about each mass - the approximation comment made above no longer applies and an exact solution to the problem can be found .",
    "the exact spherical symmetry around each mass ensures that birkhoff s theorem applies and the space - time is locally static . setting off radially from either one of the masses , in order to have an @xmath4 spatial topology , the area of the surrounding 2-spheres @xmath9 at proper distance @xmath10 from the centre of symmetry must reach a maximum and then decrease to zero at the antipodal point :",
    "indeed we would expect to have two identical static solutions ( if the 2 masses are equal ) back to back , joined at the equator of the @xmath4-spatial section .",
    "two striking results now emerge ( as will be shown in details below ) .",
    "firstly , if we want an exterior solution of this kind , we need a positive cosmological constant ; @xmath11 .",
    "hence the two local vacuum solutions to be joined together are kottler space - times @xcite rather than schwarzschild solutions , filled in by regular static bodies ( e.g. stars ) at their centers , so there is no horizon near the centre of symmetry .",
    "let us call this a kottler exterior solution .",
    "secondly , we first show that israel junction conditions @xcite impose that the two space - times can only be joined on an horizon or a surface of maximum area , where one of the metric components vanishes .",
    "however , after constructing a coordinate system regular on the horizon , we show that the matching can not be performed on the horizon .",
    "gluing the two pieces together on a surface of maximum area back to back would result in a static configuration , but this is also shown to be impossible as no coordinate system can regularly cover the neighbourhood of the surface of maximum area .",
    "this prevents the existence of a static space - time analog to the einstein - static model with the mass concentrated into two antipodal compact objects .",
    "instead , we find that the only solution contains two static regions matched across their null horizons to a pair of kantowski - sachs expanding and contracting universes ; the expansion of the universe is possible because of the existence of these spatially homogeneous but anisotropic expanding regions .",
    "this solution is obtained by considering the global structure of the exterior kottler space - time , which we show is essentially the same as that of the maximal de sitter hyperboloid @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this is again rather like the swiss - cheese models , but now with the static domains embedded across null horizons ( instead of space - like hypersurfaces in the case of the swiss - cheese ) .",
    "each static and each expanding domain covers only part of the resulting maximal kottler exterior two - mass solution , in a way exactly analogous to what occurs in the maximally extended de sitter solution .",
    "furthermore , this shows that a globally static solution can exist only at the price of introducing a ( unphysical ) surface layer .",
    "a globally non - singular 2-mass lw space - time does indeed exist , but it has horizons separating spatially inhomogeneous static domains centred on the two masses from spatially homogeneous time - evolving region .",
    "it is this expanding universe domain that allows the two masses to move away from each other , and so is the reason this universe model can expand despite the static nature of space - time near each embedded massive object",
    ".    the rest of the text will establish these results and is organized as follows : section ii is a quick summary of the statements of birkhoff s theorem ; section iii will present the results obtained when one tries to glue together two spherically symmetric static space - times ; section iv will discuss the results in a swiss - cheese configuration and comment on the analogy with the previous gluing approach ; finally section v will be a discussion of the results and their implications .",
    "birkhoff s theorem stands for the crucial result that a vacuum spherically symmetric space - time domain is necessarily either static or spatially homogeneous .",
    "this is a local result , valid even if @xmath1 is non - zero . in brief , the proof ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and also also appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be summarized by considering a general spherically symmetric space - time with metric @xmath12 ( without loss of generality , we choose @xmath13 as an area coordinate ) .",
    "first , as long as the stress - energy tensor components of the source satisfy @xmath14 , the einstein equations imply that @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that @xmath16 , which is the first part of the birkhoff theorem .",
    "then , the combination @xmath17 , that holds for a vacuum as well as a cosmological constant , implies that @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that @xmath19 can be chosen so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 the metric is static if @xmath23 ( surfaces of constant @xmath24 are spacelike ) and spatially homogeneous if @xmath25 ( surfaces of constant @xmath24 are timelike ) .",
    "thus , the existence of an extra symmetry for the metric derives from its spherical symmetric nature and the fact that @xmath14 and @xmath26 , as is valid in the exterior region surrounding a point mass or an interior static solution ( such as the schwarzschild interior solution ) . in the latter case , which is the one of interest to us , by continuity the exterior region close to the static spherically symmetric object represented by the solution",
    "is chosen to be static rather than spatially homogeneous .",
    "let us consider two space - times with metric  ( [ eq1 ] ) and coordinate systems @xmath27 in each of the two regions so that the metrics take the form @xmath28 we glue these space - times together on spacelike hypersurfaces defined by @xmath29 with @xmath30 constants , assuming we identify the angular coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see figure [ fig00 ] ) .",
    "the two normal vectors , chosen so that they are continuous across the junction ( @xmath33 points out of its domain and @xmath34 into its domain ) , are given by @xmath35 .",
    "the induced metrics and extrinsic curvatures are thus given by @xmath36    -.5 cm   and boundaries @xmath37 that are identified via the mapping @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 are the vectors normal to the hypersurfaces @xmath37.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] -3 cm    it follows from eq .",
    "( [ inducedg1 ] ) , using the standard israel junction conditions  @xcite , that the continuity of the induced metric imposes that @xmath40 and that @xmath41 .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ extrinsick1 ] ) that the extrinsic curvature can be continuous only if @xmath42 , which occurs at a horizon . in conclusion , _ only on a horizon ( @xmath43 ) may two spherically symmetric static space - times possibly be glued back to back .",
    "_ we can not use the schwarzschild coordinates to perform the matching at the horizon because this coordinates system is singular there .",
    "let us assume that @xmath44 is such that @xmath45 and let us taylor expand @xmath19 in a neighborhood of @xmath44 as @xmath46 with @xmath47 . using the coordinate @xmath48 defined by @xmath49",
    "we deduce that @xmath50 in a neighborhood of @xmath51 . introducing the null - coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the relabelling @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ", the metric in the neighborhood of @xmath44 takes the form @xmath56 , and is regular in @xmath57 , that is on @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath10 is defined in such a way that @xmath59 is the surface area of a 2-sphere of radius @xmath10 , which defines it uniquely .",
    "now , we can study the matching between two space - times @xmath60 any spherically symmetric spacelike hypersurface @xmath61 corresponds to a hypersurface of equation @xmath62 so that the normal unit spacelike vector is @xmath63 the induced metric is then given , as previously , by @xmath64 so that its continuity implies , as previously , @xmath40 .",
    "now , the continuity of the extrinsic curvature implies that @xmath65 is continuous , which is impossible .",
    "this show that _ the back to back matching of two static solutions can not be performed on the horizon @xmath66_.    thus , it is _ impossible _ to glue two spherically symmetric static space - times on a spherically symmetric and static boundary , even if the boundary is a horizon .      in the previous argument",
    ", we required the gluing surface to be a constant @xmath10 hypersurface ; in order to check if this is a restrictive assumption , let us generalize to the situation in which the boundary is moving , i.e. @xmath67 . the two matching hypersurfaces are defined by @xmath68 , that we assume to be spacelike ( we separately show that the null - surface case is indeed possible , see below ) .",

    "as @xmath30 and @xmath74 are both positive functions , it is impossible to have continuity of @xmath75 unless @xmath76=0 $ ] for all @xmath77 .",
    "this imposes that @xmath78 , and thus , a configuration with @xmath79 can not be constructed if the join surfaces are timelike .      to summarize , two spherically symmetric static solutions can not be glued together back - to - back to obtain a static space - time with the spatial topology of a 3-sphere .",
    "in particular , this implies that we can not glue two schwarzschild exterior solutions together to get a 2-mass space - time with @xmath4 topology .",
    "this can be possible only at the expense of introducing a surface layer , which we do not want to consider .",
    "we now show that a spatially closed space - time with two masses the spatial size of which is larger than their schwarzschild horizon can be constructed using two copies of the exterior kottler space - time   @xcite , which is the generalisation of the schwarzschild solution to incorporate a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "this solution has two horizons , a black - hole horizon at @xmath80 similar to the schwarzschild horizon and a cosmological horizon at @xmath81 similar to the de sitter horizon .    as we shall see , a solution with a @xmath4 spatial topology with two antipodal masses can be constructed but with an expanding domain in between the two static domains , as will become clear once we construct the penrose - carter diagram for the solution .      the kottler solution @xcite ( for a summary see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the extension of the schwarzschild solution to include a cosmological constant , @xmath82 it is easy to check that the killing vector @xmath83 has norm @xmath84 and is thus timelike as long as @xmath23 . we thus have two cases :    * if @xmath85 , @xmath19 is negative for @xmath86 so that @xmath87 is spacelike and the space - time contains no static region but is spatially homogeneous .",
    "we exclude this case as it does not allow a static central body . * if @xmath88",
    ", @xmath19 is positive for @xmath10 between @xmath89 and @xmath90 which correspond respectively to the black - hole and cosmological horizons .",
    "they can be found to be given by @xmath91 so that we have @xmath92 the space - time is thus static in the region @xmath93 .",
    "it is clear that the third root is negative since @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 are killing horizons since @xmath95 vanishes on these hypersurfaces .",
    "one can check that for both values , @xmath96 ( the horizons are not degenerate ) and @xmath97 .",
    "we consider solutions of this second type where an interior solution representing a spherically symmetric body occupies the region @xmath98 .",
    "this requires that @xmath99 , so the spatially homogeneous vacuum region for @xmath100 is filled in by the body ; hence there is no horizon at @xmath101 .",
    "we require that @xmath102 ( there is some vacuum region around the central body ) .",
    "such a solution will be called a _",
    "kottler exterior solution_.    the metric can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath48 defined by @xmath103 that is explicitly given by @xmath104\\ ] ] with @xmath105 .      to explicitly describe this solution ,",
    "let us construct its penrose - carter diagram ( see ref .",
    "obviously , the metric can be rewritten using the ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates as @xmath106 with @xmath107 or the outgoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates as @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",

    "when @xmath23 , it is spacelike and one recovers the kottler solution under its static form ( set @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) while when @xmath25 the killing vector is timelike and one gets a homogeneous solution ( set @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "using the null - coordinates @xmath115 leads to the usual form @xmath116 which remains pathological when @xmath117 . as usual with horizon , the surfaces of constant @xmath118 or constant @xmath119 ( resp .",

    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .    from this latter form",
    ", we can deduce the penrose - carter diagram depicted on fig .",
    "the penrose - carter diagram of our exterior solution with two identical masses is only a subset of the general diagram and is depicted on fig .",
    "it is obtained by gluing another copy of the space - time described on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig0 ] and by cutting the two static regions at a given radius @xmath127 ( represented by the thick lines ) to restrict to the exterior solution of interest .",
    "we see that it exhibits two static regions around each mass extending up to the cosmological horizons ( at @xmath81 ) .",
    "the two horizons can not be glued together and there must exist a homogeneous region in between them . in this homogeneous region connecting the two static regions ,",
    "the @xmath10 coordinate is effectively a timelike coordinate whereas @xmath24 is a radial coordinate .",
    "note that the two massive bodies are causally disconnected : light emitted in the static region surrounding one of the masses will eventually cross the first horizon , reach the expanding region and attain @xmath128 ( that is timelike ) but will never cross the second horizon .",
    "note also that the killing vector can not be timelike everywhere , since the horizon is a null surface .",
    "this is the reason why there is no analog of the einstein static universe with the masses concentrated in two antipodal compact objects .",
    "let us also note that similar diagrams have been constructed in ref .",

    "indeed , the exact form of the embedding can not be determined analytically but assuming the masses are such that @xmath129 , the structure of the space - times on cosmological scales are closed to the one of a de sitter space - time . nevertheless",
    ", the worldlines of the two masses do not have the symmetries of a de sitter space - time and therefore induces a preferred slicing of space - time ; hence resulting in a preferred time direction .",
    "the expanding region has a metric given by @xmath130 defining @xmath131 and @xmath132 , it takes the form @xmath133 this anisotropic expanding region is the interior solution of a black - hole ( see e.g. @xcite ) in the vacuum case , but is of the kantowski - sachs form when filled with a fluid ( and possibly a cosmological constant ) @xcite .",
    "this is thus another kind of swiss cheese model but within a anisotropic vacuum space - time in the expanding region .",
    "-.25 cm   -1 cm    taking horizontal sections at different times , we get @xmath4 spatial slicings that contain back to back copies of a massive object surrounded by a static vacuum that is in turn surrounded by an expanding universe domain that has a cross sectional area that increases to a maximum , where it is matched to an identical solution in back to back fashion ( see the inset diagram in fig 4 ) . as time progresses , the size of the expanding universe section decreases from most of the spatial section ( at large negative times ) to zero and then increases again to most of the spatial sections ( at large positive times ) .",
    "this is like the wheeler analysis of the time evolution of the throat in a black hole universe .",
    "this gives a two - mass version of the de sitter expanding universe .",
    "it can be envisioned as two world lines added antipodally to the maximal @xmath134 de sitter hyperboloid .",
    "if these are of very small mass , by continuity the global structure @xcite will remain unchanged .",

    "a standard method to embed a single mass in an expanding space - time is to use the einstein - strauss method @xcite to construct a swiss - cheese model @xcite .",
