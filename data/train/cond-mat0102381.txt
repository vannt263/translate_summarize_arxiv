    "magnetic mechanisms of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) have become the subject of intensive investigations during last decades ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it was argued that the superconducting properties of htsc materials are intimately related to their magnetic properties in the normal phase . in particular ,",
    "many features of htsc compounds were explained from the point of view of the competition of antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters @xcite .",
    "a similar physical situation takes place in ruthenates like sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 where the interplay of ferromagnetism and @xmath4-wave superconductivity is of crucial importance @xcite .",
    "both copper - oxide systems and sr@xmath2ruo@xmath5 are layered compounds .",
    "therefore a general problem can be formulated as the investigation of the competition between magnetic and superconducting instabilities in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems .",
    "on the other hand , the problem should be concretized .",
    "there are some evidences from both electron structure calculations and experimental data that the fermi surface ( fs ) of htsc compounds at optimal doping or optimal pressure is close to the van hove ( vh ) singularities of electron spectrum ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; the situation in the ruthenates is similar @xcite . due to the presence of vh singularities ,",
    "the density of states at the fermi level becomes logarithmically divergent , which makes the fermi liquid unstable with respect to magnetic ordering or superconductivity .",
    "one may expect _ a priori _ that near vh band fillings the physics is determined by vh points and is not sensitive to the form of the whole fs .",
    "this should be correct provided that fs is not nested , since in the nesting situation @xcite the contribution of flat fs parts is also important @xcite .",
    "as it was first discussed by dzyaloshinskii @xcite , the situation in 2d fermion system near vh fillings is similar in some respects to that in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite or in 2d systems under the nesting condition @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in the instability region the `` normal '' state can demonstrate a non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "the simplest model which gives a possibility to investigate the effects of vh singularities on magnetic ordering and superconductivity is the @xmath0-@xmath6 hubbard model which takes into account nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "it is often discussed also in connection with htsc compounds where the value @xmath7 was determined for la@xmath8cuo@xmath5 and the value @xmath9 for the bi2212 system @xcite ( we neglect third - neighbors hopping @xmath10 which does not lead to any qualitative changes ) .",
    "the interplay of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity near vh fillings within the hubbard model with @xmath11 was first investigated in refs .",
    "it was shown that the leading instability in this case is antiferromagnetic one , and the transition temperature is close to its mean - field value .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite did not include the contribution of the particle - hole scattering at small momenta , as well as particle - particle scattering at momenta near @xmath12 by the reason that these contributions are logarithmic rather than double - logarithmic .",
    "as we will argue in the present paper , even for weak - to - intermediate coupling regime these contributions should be also taken into account , which leads to an essential change of the results .",
    "recently , the authors of ref . @xcite have performed the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of the states close to fs ( not only near vh singularities ) within an approach which is similar to that of ref . @xcite . at @xmath9",
    "they found competing antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , depending on the band filling .",
    "however , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite also does not enable one to treat particle - hole scattering at small momenta on the equal footing with other contributions .",
    "as it was shown by the rg analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , the account of particle - hole scattering leads to occurrence of ferromagnetic phase at large enough @xmath13 the criterion @xmath14 for the stability of ferromagnetism was obtained . at @xmath15",
    "it was also found that either antiferromagnetism or superconductivity takes place .",
    "however , unlike refs.@xcite , the contributions of the cooper channel were not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite . the backward influence of the cooper channel on magnetic ordering was investigated within the @xmath16-matrix approach @xcite .",
    "it was found for the non - degenerate hubbard model that the cooper channel strongly suppresses strongly the tendency to ferromagnetism , so that it is possible only for @xmath17 numerical calculations@xcite predict much larger values @xmath18 for the stability of ferromagnetism at vh filling : @xmath19 .",
    "summarizing all these approaches , one can see that we need to consider on the equal footing all four types of scattering to obtain the correct phase diagram , i.e. the particle - particle and particle - hole channels at both small momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "first step in this direction was made in refs .",
    "@xcite within the so - called two - patch approach .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite wrote down approximate equations , which were very similar to the parquet equations in one dimension @xcite , and obtained reasonable physical results .",
    "however , they also neglected particle - hole scattering at small momenta and particle - particle scattering at @xmath21 at final stage .    besides that , these 1d - like equations do not reproduce correctly all the peculiarities of the 2d dispersion law even close to vh singularities . from this point of view",
    ", most straightforward is the parquet approach of refs .",
    "@xcite ( for a review see also ref .",
    "it was applied to the vh singularity  problem in refs .",
    "@xcite , but only the case @xmath22 was considered ( strictly speaking , this case requires an account of the whole fs because of nesting @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider different phases of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model @xmath23 and construct the phase diagram near vh fillings within the approach @xcite .",
    "note that this approach is somewhat different from that used in later papers @xcite and , as we will argue in this work , is more correct .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "in sect.2 we discuss noninteracting susceptibilities and consider the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . in sect .",
    "3 we consider two - patch equations with all four channels of scattering included and discuss the results of numerical solution of these equations . in sect.4",
    "we consider a full parquet approach to vh problem and compare the results with those of two - patch approach . in conclusion",
    "we summarize main results of the paper and discuss possible directions of further investigations .",
    "we consider @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model on the square lattice : @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the chemical potential ( we have picked out @xmath27 for farther convenience ) and we have already absorbed the sign of @xmath28 into eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) ( hereafter we assume the transfer integrals @xmath29 to be positive , @xmath30 ) .",

    "in fact , two other polarization bubbles of fig.1b , which are responsible for zero - momentum and @xmath53-pairing , are also divergent at small @xmath54 :    [ pi0 ] @xmath55 where    @xmath56 for @xmath57 we again have the replacements @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 in ( [ pi0a ] ) .    in the rpa",
    "the expressions for particle - hole and particle - particle susceptibilities read @xmath61 thus @xmath62 decreases when the coulomb interaction is taken into account , while @xmath63 increases and can diverge at some @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , we have the conventional stoner criterium of ferromagnetism @xmath65 or @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the spin splitting ) .",
    "the solution to this equation reads @xmath69\\ ] ] therefore the ferromagnetism is present at any @xmath70 moreover , at @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] one can expect that it becomes saturated .",
    "similarly , considering the antiferromagnetic instability we obtain @xmath72 which gives @xmath73 so that antiferromagnetism is favorable at small @xmath74    however , as it was discussed first by dzyaloshinskii and coworkers @xcite , rpa is incorrect even in the weak - coupling limit , except for the case when only one bubble is divergent . since in the vh case all four bubbles of fig.1 are divergent , we have to use the parquet approach @xcite instead of rpa .",
    "while in 1d case the parquet equations reduce to conventional differential rg equations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , for higher space dimensionalities we have coupled integral equations .",
    "first we consider the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite which uses mapping of the full parquet equations on an `` effective '' 1d problem , i.e. so - called two - patch equations .",
    "the authors of refs.@xcite proposed the approach which neglects the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( and consequently between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) and introduced a single scaling variable @xmath79 note that this approach is not strict , in particular because of the presence of double - logarithmic terms in ( [ hi0b ] ) and ( [ pi0a ] ) . at the same time , as we will see below ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this reproduces correctly main features of the exact parquet equations .",
    "the two - patch equations read @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and four vertices @xmath83 are defined in fig.3 . in these notations",

    "@xcite , we perform a more general consideration where all the bubbles are taken into account .",
    "we have also taken into account the coefficient @xmath86 to treat correctly the @xmath1 dependence of the amplitude of particle - particle scattering .",
    "note that the equations ( [ twopatch ] ) are very similar to those in the 1d case @xcite with the difference that in the latter case one has @xmath87 the complete discussion of the physics of the equations ( [ twopatch ] ) in the 1d case is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in two dimensions , the coefficients",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 become @xmath90-dependent because of the presence of double - logarithmic terms .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this gives only approximate treatment of such terms .",
    "the equations ( [ twopatch ] ) give a possibility to investigate the interplay of all the four scattering channels .    for ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , and",
    "d - wave superconducting susceptibilities we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 satisfies the equation @xmath93 thus , when @xmath94 and @xmath95 are simultaneously relevant , we have ferromagnetic ordering , while @xmath96 and @xmath97 lead to antiferromagnetic ordering . for the superconductivity , we have a more complicated combination of relevant and irrelevant vertices .",
    "the results of the solution of equations ( [ twopatch])-([t ] ) for various values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown in fig.4 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath98 and @xmath100 ferro- or antiferromagnetic susceptibility , or @xmath101-wave superconducting response diverges first .",
    "the parameter dependences of the critical energy scale @xmath102 are shown in fig.5 .",
    "this scale can be approximately identified with the critical chemical potential or transition temperature . for comparison ,",
    "the rpa results for the stability of ferro- and antiferromagnetism are shown too .",
    "one can see that the values of transition temperatures obtained from the two - patch equations are much lower than the corresponding rpa results .    to understand qualitatively the nature of the critical temperature lowering",
    ", we may neglect the interpatch scattering . in the ferromagnetic case we have only one nonzero vertex @xmath103 and the equation for it has the form @xmath104",
    "so that @xmath105 the modification of the stoner criterion takes the form @xmath106 then we have from ( [ msc ] ) at @xmath107 ( which is the case of @xmath0-@xmath6 model ) @xmath108 ( for @xmath109 close to unity we have @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus , the decrease of the curie temperature in comparison with the mean - field  approach ( @xmath111 ) is directly connected with the account of the cooper bubble , which is in agreement with the @xmath16-matrix approximation@xcite . note , however , that the structure of eq .",
    "( [ g4 ] ) is different from that obtained in the @xmath16-matrix approach .    the resulting phase diagram in @xmath64-@xmath99 plane with all the scattering channels being included is shown in fig .",

    "this is the leading divergent response only at small values of coupling constant @xmath113 which corresponds to @xmath114 .",
    "the critical temperature in this region is also exponentially small ( @xmath115 ) .",

    "we use the generalization of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of two dimensions .    in the parquet approach",

    ", the approach we use gives a possibility to treat the 2d situation in a more correct way in comparison with the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parquet equations were solved numerically . to this end",
    ", we placed the variables @xmath138 on a grid with @xmath139 points in each dimension , so that the total number of vertices to be taken into account is @xmath140 .",
    "it is important that the grid was chosen for the logarithmic variables @xmath141 but not for the momenta themselves .",
    "this gives a possibility to use simple integration methods ( e.g. , the trapezium method ) to obtain the results which are correct to logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the resulting system of @xmath142 algebraic equations was solved by the zeidel method .",
    "the structure of the solutions of the parquet equations is quite similar to that in the two - patch approach , except for that now we have momenta - dependent vertices . again , the relevance of @xmath94 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 leads to ferromagnetic ordering , while the relevance of @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath145 to antiferromagnetic one .",
    "the results of solution of the parquet equations are shown in figs.8 , 9 .",
    "one can see that the results coincide qualitatively with those of the two - patch parquet approach of sect.3 . at not too large @xmath100",
    "the antiferromagnetic instability occurs first , while for @xmath99 close to @xmath146 the leading instability is ferromagnetic one .",
    "the superconductivity occurs also only for very small @xmath98 .",
    "the transition temperatures obtained within the parquet approach are larger than those obtained from two - patch equations , but are still lower than the rpa results .",
    "in particular , in the limit of small @xmath99 the parquet calculations@xcite , which do not take into account single - logarithmic contributions of the loops fig.1a , d , yield for @xmath147 the critical value for stability of antiferromagnetism @xmath148 which is close to rpa result , @xmath149 . at the same time",
    ", our parquet calculations give larger value , @xmath150 ( the result of two - patch equations is @xmath151 ) .",
    "the region of stability of @xmath101-wave superconducting phase is even smaller than that obtained from two - patch equations .    the critical concentrations @xmath152 for the stability of ferro- or antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases close to vh filling can be estimated from the critical chemical potential with the use of the condition @xmath153 using the form of spectrum ( [ ek ] ) and taking the limit of filling close to vh one , we obtain for @xmath154 @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the vh filling . in particular , for @xmath147 ( @xmath157 ) we have from fig.8 @xmath158 thus , except for the limit @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) , the critical concentrations are very small , which is in qualitative agreement with the results of ref . @xcite . because of the exponential smallness of the critical chemical potential , the critical concentrations for the superconducting phase are even smaller than those for the magnetically ordered phases .",
    "now we summarize the main results of the paper . using the two - patch equations ( sect .",
    "3 ) and parquet equations ( sect .",
    "4 ) we constructed the phase diagrams of @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model ( figs .",
    "5,6,8,9 ) at the fillings which are close to van hove one .",
    "it was argued that the simultaneous account of all the scattering channels is important in considering the vh problem , the smallness of contributions of some channels ( logarithmical vs. double - logarithmical divergence ) being compensated by the growth of relevant couplings .",
    "both the approaches used , two - patch and parquet ones , give similar phase diagrams . in agreement with the previous approaches @xcite ,",
    "antiferromagnetism is favorable for small @xmath161 while ferromagnetism for larger values of @xmath74 the stability of antiferro- and especially ferromagnetism is greatly reduced in comparison with the corresponding mean - field criteria .",
    "thus the stoner criterion is completely inapplicable for the systems with vh singularities ; depending on the value @xmath100 it overestimates the critical temperature by 2 - 10 times .",
    "this conclusion is in qualitative agreement with the results of ref .",
    "besides that , the mean - field approach is unable to determine the critical value @xmath18 which separates the ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases .    unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath18 is @xmath64-dependent and decreases with increasing @xmath162 although the rg ( and also parquet ) approach is unable to describe the ordered states , from scaling arguments we have @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the magnetization critical exponent . with increasing @xmath165",
    "the ferro- and antiferromagnetic states are characterized by large magnetic moments , and ferromagnetism possibly becomes saturated .",
    "however , these values of @xmath64 are not described by perturbative approaches and should be treated in the strong - coupling limit . at the same time , determining parameters of the ferro - antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition would be of interest , especially the critical exponents .",
    "one can expect that they are independent of the coupling .",
    "another result of the paper is that the tendency to @xmath101-wave superconducting pairing is considerably reduced in comparison with the treatments of refs .",
    "@xcite : it can occur only at very small values of @xmath64 . of course , this concerns only the pairing due to the vh singularities themselves ; the pairing can be further enhanced by other factors",
    ". this can be also the subject for future investigations .",
    "details of the electron spectrum , especially the form of the fermion green s functions close to the phase transition into the ferro- or antiferromagnetic state are beyond the scope of the present paper . although the marginal @xcite and non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite was found ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this problem needs further investigations , since a simultaneous account of all the scattering channels can be important in this case too .",
    "for example , only one of four scattering channels was included in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we believe that the results of the present paper can be also important for the theory of itinerant - electron ferromagnetism . a standard consideration ( including contemporary spin - fluctuation theories @xcite ) starts from the rpa approach .",
    "it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that for almost all known itinerant electron ferromagnets the fermi level lies near a 2d - like vh singularity .",
    "this is a result of merging two weaker 3d square - root singularities along symmetrical directions in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "we have shown that under such conditions the rpa approach and the stoner criterion are not applicable even qualitatively because of the strong interference with the cooper channel .",
    "of course , the effect of the logarithmic vh singularity in the 3d case is not exactly the same as in the pure 2d case considered here , so that the 3d problem needs further investigations .",
    "however , the naive stoner criterion is in any case doubtful and needs a careful justification .    in this respect ,",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the results of the present paper ( at least those from the two - patch equations ) on the degenerate - band hubbard model . as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this case the suppression of ferromagnetic ordering is much weaker than for the nondegenerate model considered .",
    "one can also expect that the particle - hole scattering with small momenta will not renormalize superconducting channel as strongly as for the non - degenerate model . however , these statements need further justification since the diagram series in the degenerate and non - degenerate cases look like rather similar .",
    "the research described was supported in part by grant no.00 - 15 - 96544 from the russian basic research foundation ( support of scientific schools ) .",

    "@xmath179 and we obtain from ( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ gcz1 ] ) the standard ladder equation @xmath180 this has the solution @xmath181    now we return to the general case @xmath182 as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the equations ( [ g1])-([gcz1 ] ) at @xmath183 can be reduced to @xmath184 which is equivalent to the differential rg equation @xmath185 since in one dimension @xmath186",
    "@xmath187 @xmath168 is marginal and we have a luttinger - liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the equations ( [ rg ] )  or ( [ rg1 ] ) can be obtained directly with the use of the sudakov s trick @xcite or standard rg approach @xcite without considering the general dependence @xmath188 .",
    "thus , in the 1d case the parquet and rg approaches are equivalent .    in the 2d case",
    "we have two pairs of variables , @xmath125 and @xmath189 however , unlike the 1d case , now two possibilities occur : the momentum integration in bubbles can be logarithmical or double - logarithmical . for example we consider the case where the integration in the cooper bubble is double - logarithmic while in the zero - sound channel this yields only simple logarithms ( which is similar to the situation for vh singularities ) .",
    "then it can be checked by a direct comparison with perturbation theory that the equations @xmath190 with @xmath191 give the parquet solution of the problem .",
