    "the advent of _ astro - e2 _ @xcite will enable us to directly measure velocity fields of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies for the first time .",
    "the calorimeter ( _ x - ray spectrometer ; xrs _ ) of _ astro - e2 _ has an excellent spectroscopic resolving power @xcite , and it could detect the bulk gas motion by observing the energy shift of metal lines and the turbulence by observing broadened metal lines . on the other hand , many hydrodynamic simulations have been performed to study the motion of the icm ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with _",
    "astro - e2 _ , we could confirm the results of those hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "however , the direct comparison of x - ray observations to hydrodynamic simulations is not always simple , because of complex such as instrumental responses .    in this paper",
    ", we construct the x - ray spectra from the results of hydrodynamic simulations of cluster cores affected by ` tsunamis ' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i , see also @xcite ) and we simulate observations with _ astro - e2 xrs_. in the tsunami model , large - scale bulk gas motions in the icm , which are called tsunamis , induce fully - developed turbulence in cluster cores . the ultimate spectroscopic capability of _ xrs _ with an energy resolution of @xmath0  ev at 6  kev for",
    "extended sources as well as point sources could give us a new approach to detect the turbulence in the icm .",
    "because of the kinetic energy of turbulence and the hot gas brought into the core by turbulent mixing , the radiative heating of the core is suppressed .",
    "thus , this model could solve the so - called ` cooling flow problem ' @xcite .    from the mock observations with _ astro - e2 _ , we measure velocity fields of the icm and compare them with the emission weighted values inferred directly from the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we investigate whether the former is consistent with the latter .",
    "most observations of clusters scheduled as _ astro - e2 _ performance verification targets in the first 6 months are planned pointing at their centers ; one of the reasons is that the effective area of the _ xrs _ is relatively small and objects must be bright enough to be observed .",
    "thus , it would be useful to simulate the observations focused on cluster cores .",
    "it should be noted that other solutions of the cooling flow problem besides the tsunamis , especially those based on agn activities , also predict similar level of turbulence in cluster cores , which some observations have already suggested ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we use the results of hydrodynamic simulations done in paper  i. these simulations are performed using a two - dimensional ( cylindrically symmetric ) nested grid code @xcite , and the coordinates are represented by @xmath4 . since the structure of turbulence in the axi - symmetric coordinate might be different from that in the fully three - dimensional coordinate , it is ideal to perform three - dimensional calculations .",
    "however , a high spatial resolution with a large dynamic range is also crucial to simulate a turbulent medium , especially for the tsunami model .",
    "therefore we here restrict the calculations to two dimensions .",
    "the cluster center corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "although the maximum resolution of the simulations is achieved on the level of grids of 22  pc , we use the simulation results on the level of the grids of 1.4  kpc , because the turbulent velocity is generally smaller on smaller scales and it helps us reduce the number of computational grid points for which we calculate the spectra .",
    "we will argue that the effect of the lower resolution on the x - ray spectra can be ignored in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "note that in the nested grid code we used , calculations are performed on all grid levels simultaneously . at the cluster center , for example , the solutions ( density , temperature , etc . )",
    "are obtained on the seven different resolutions .",
    "the results of the lower resolution grids are just the coarsened ones of the higher resolution grids .",
    "we use the simulation results for @xmath6 computational grid points . for each grid point",
    ", we calculate the x - ray spectrum using a single bapec thermal model and the data simulation command fakeit in the xspec package ( version  11.3.1 ) .",
    "the bapec model is the same as the apec model but includes a parameter for turbulent velocity broadening to emission lines .",
    "the input parameters of the spectrum for the @xmath7-th grid point are the temperature ( @xmath8 ) , the metal abundance ( @xmath9 ) , the gas velocity along the line of sight ( @xmath10 ) , and the normalization . the turbulent velocity for each grid point is assumed to be zero , that is , the gas velocity is uniform within a single grid point .",
    "we used the _ astro - e2 xrs _ response file ( xrs_ao1.rmf ) and the auxiliary file ( xrs_onaxis_open_ao1.arf ) provided by the _ astro - e2 _ team as planning tools for ao-1 proposals .",
    "weighting the three - dimensional volumes of the grid points , the spectra are summed up by the ftools manipulation task mathpha . in order to avoid the error caused by small photon counts ,",
    "we multiply the photon counts for each grid point by 100000 . after the summation by mathpha ,",
    "the total photon counts are divided by 100000 using the fcalc task in the ftools .",
    "since fcalc discard fractions in the calculation of the photon counts , we add 50000 to the counts before the division in order to round off .",
    "for the resultant spectrum , the error of photon counts in each energy bin is assumed to be the square root of the photon counts in the bin .",
    "background emission and galactic absorption are ignored .",
    "we do not consider the effect of resonance scattering for metal emission lines , because the calculation of multi - dimensional radiative transfer is required and it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in paper  i , we calculated the evolution of the cool core of a cluster for @xmath11  kpc and @xmath12  kpc .",
    "we approximated the bulk gas motions in a cluster by plane wave - like velocity perturbations in the @xmath13-direction represented by @xmath14 at @xmath15  kpc , where @xmath16 is the initial sound velocity , and @xmath17 is the wave length .",
    "the waves propagate in the @xmath13-direction . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the cluster is isothermal ( @xmath19  kev ) .",
    "metal abundance is uniform and @xmath20 .",
    "we construct x - ray spectra for two models with different @xmath17 ( table  [ tab : model ] ) .",
    "the model of @xmath21 and @xmath22  kpc ( model  a ) was studied in paper  i. the model of @xmath21 and @xmath23  kpc ( model  b ) is newly studied and the detailed analysis of the results will be discussed elsewhere ( matsumoto , fujita , & wada 2004 , in preparation ) . compared to model  a , rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities develop on larger scales in model  b. this makes turbulent mixing and heating more effective .",
    "we assume that the model cluster is at redshifts of 0.01 , 0.04 , and  0.08 , although the temperature outside of the core is @xmath24  kev and there is no such a high - temperature cluster at redshift of 0.01 . since the field of view of _ astro - e2 xrs _ is @xmath25 , we consider the x - ray emission within a radius of @xmath26 from the cluster center . at redshifts of 0.01 , 0.04 , and  0.08 , the angle of @xmath26 corresponds to 18.5 , 71.3 , and  136  kpc , respectively .",
    "we ` observe ' the model cluster along the @xmath13-axis , that is , the line of sight is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath13-axis .",
    "this is because the waves were injected along that axis , and thus the icm velocity in the @xmath13-direction is much larger than that in the @xmath27-direction .",
    "thus , we sum up the spectra of the icm in individual grid points for @xmath28 , 71.3 , and  136  kpc and @xmath29  kpc for the cluster at redshifts of 0.01 , 0.04 , and  0.08 , respectively .",
    "this means that for a cluster at a larger redshift , we observe a larger area .",
    "the assumed exposure time is 50  ks . using xspec",
    ", we fit the summed spectra with a single bapec model . the spectra were grouped to have a minimum of 50 counts per bin .",
    "we limited the energy range to 510  kev ( at the cluster - rest frames ) that includes fe  k lines ( @xmath30  kev ) .",
    "free parameters in the bapec model are the temperature ( @xmath31 ) , the metal abundance ( @xmath32 ) , the average velocity ( @xmath33 ) , the turbulent velocity ( @xmath34 ) , and the normalization .",
    "we choose @xmath35  gyr for model  a ; the temperature distribution at that time is shown in paper  i. we choose @xmath36  gyr for model  b. for model  a , the gas temperature in at least one of the grid points reaches zero at @xmath35  gyr ( paper  i ) , while for model  b , it reaches zero at @xmath37  gyr .",
    "note that the time - scale of 6.2  gyr is comparable to the typical age of clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and thus radiative cooling is almost completely suppressed in model  b.    figure  [ fig : sp ] shows the simulated x - ray spectrum around @xmath38  kev fe  k lines for model  b at redshift of 0.04 and the result of the fit . for comparison , the spectrum when @xmath39 and @xmath40 is also shown . as can be seen ,",
    "the two spectra ( i.e. with and without turbulent motion ) are remarkably different .",
    "the results of the spectral fits for all models are shown in table  [ tab : para ] .",
    "errors on fitted spectral parameters are given at the 90% confidence level . in figure",
    "[ fig : vel ] , we show @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "most models require non - zero turbulent velocity .",
    "the values of @xmath41 are generally small and the fits are good .",
    "the results show that the line shift and turbulence will be detected with _ astro - e2 xrs _ if @xmath42 and @xmath43 , because @xmath39 and @xmath40 are rejected , respectively ( table  [ tab : para ] ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that our results correspond to an ideal case .",
    "for example , we did not consider possible systematic errors remaining even after calibrations .",
    "moreover , if the line of sight is perpendicular to the @xmath13-axis , observed average and turbulent velocities are smaller .",
    "thus , turbulence could not be detected for all clusters .    for comparison ,",
    "we present the luminosity - weighted turbulent velocities in the @xmath13-direction that are directly derived from the results of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "they are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gas velocity in the @xmath13-direction , and @xmath46 is the luminosity of the @xmath7-th grid point . as for the luminosity",
    ", we consider both the bolometric luminosity , @xmath47 , and the fe  k - line luminosity @xmath48 .",
    "using xspec and the bapec model , we found that the emissivity to be used for the latter is approximately given by @xmath49 \\ :   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the 6.66.72  kev band , where @xmath31 is the icm temperature ( kev ) , @xmath32 is the metal abundance ( @xmath50 ) , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the electron density and the hydrogen density ( @xmath53 ) , respectively .",
    "this approximation holds within a few percent for @xmath54  kev ( even at @xmath55  kev , the error is @xmath56  % ) .",
    "we ignore the fe ",
    "k emission from the icm of @xmath57  kev , because @xmath58 and the mass of such gas is small in our calculations . in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_zl ] ) , the average gas velocity in the @xmath13-direction , @xmath59 , is given by @xmath60 we refer to @xmath61 and  @xmath59 weighted by the bolometric luminosities as @xmath62 and  @xmath63 , respectively , and those weighted by the fe ",
    "k luminosities as @xmath64 and  @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the velocities are shown in figure  [ fig : vel ] and @xmath64 and  @xmath65 are also shown in table  [ tab : para ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sp ] , the line profiles appear nearly symmetric .",
    "this is because the probability distribution function for @xmath66 is almost symmetric ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated line emission from turbulent gas in detail and indicated that line profiles could be very complicated ; asymmetry would be observed in the x - ray spectra .",
    "however , for the turbulence we considered , the expected asymmetry is too small to be detected with the energy resolution of _ astro - e2 xrs_. on the other hand , the asymmetric injection of tsunamis is observed as a large offset of @xmath67 ( model  b ; table  [ tab : para ] ) , because the asymmetric tsunamis ( e.g. those created by cluster mergers ) sometimes induce not only the turbulence but also the bulk motion ( or oscillation ) of the cool core ; the latter is unlikely to be induced by symmetric jets accompanied by agn activities .",
    "therefore , the relative motion between the cd galaxy ( stars ) and the strongly turbulent core ( gas ) in a cluster could be a clue to confirm the tsunami model as well as the detection of turbulence in clusters without agn activities .",
    "figure  [ fig : vel ] shows that @xmath33 and @xmath65 are consistent , and also show that @xmath34 and @xmath68 are consistent .",
    "these mean that velocity fields obtained through hydrodynamic simulations can directly be compared with x - ray observations without resorting to mock observations like the one we did here , if the velocities are weighted by line - emission . on the other hand , near the cluster center , which means at smaller redshift , in model  a , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not consistent with @xmath63 and @xmath62 , respectively ( figure  [ fig : vel ] ) .",
    "however , they are consistent in model  b. the difference between model  a and  b is because radiative cooling proceeds more and the gas temperature at the cluster center is lower for model  a at @xmath35  gyr than for model  b at @xmath36  gyr . in model  a , the temperature near the cluster center is @xmath69  kev , which is much smaller than the temperature outside of the core ( @xmath24  kev ) and the fe ",
    "k emission is relatively weak . since cooler gas tends to have larger bulk and turbulent velocities , the gases with larger velocities are less weighted by the fe",
    " k luminosities .",
    "therefore , in model  a , the velocities weighted by the bolometric luminosities ( @xmath70 and @xmath62 ) are larger than those weighted by the fe  k luminosities ( @xmath71 and @xmath64 ) near the cluster center . on the other hand , in model  b , the gas temperature in the central region of the cluster is @xmath72  kev and the temperature gradient near the center is small compared to that in model  a. therefore , @xmath63 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath64 ) are almost the same .    in figure  [",
    "fig : vel ] , the luminosity - weighted turbulent velocities , @xmath62 and @xmath64 , increase toward the cluster center ( toward smaller redshift ) .",
    "this means that the turbulence produced by tsunamis is more detectable at the cluster center .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : const ] , we used a low resolution grid .",
    "however , we expect that the effect of the coarsening on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 is small , because @xmath65 and @xmath64 are not much different in between the low resolution grid and the highest one ; the difference is much smaller than the errors of @xmath33 and @xmath34 presented in table  [ tab : para ] and figure  [ fig : vel ] .",
    "since @xmath33 and @xmath65 ( @xmath34 and @xmath64 ) are almost same as discussed above , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) will not change much even for the finest grid .",
    "we also ` observed ' the cluster from the direction perpendicular to the @xmath13-axis and we call this direction @xmath74 . because of the symmetry we assumed ,",
    "the average velocities , @xmath75 , are zero .",
    "the turbulent velocities derived from the mock observations are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for model  a and  b , respectively .",
    "consistency between @xmath78 and those weighted by fe ",
    "k lines , @xmath79 , is also good .",
    "we have constructed x - ray spectra from the results of hydrodynamic simulations of clusters of galaxies based on the tsunami model , in which turbulence is created in cluster cores .",
    "similar levels of turbulence are also predicted by many of other heating models of cool cores ( e.g. motion of bubbles created by agn activities ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , we focus on the effect of velocity fields of the icm on the spectra .",
    "we simulate x - ray observations with _ astro - e2 xrs _ and find that velocity fields in cluster cores could be revealed with the satellite .",
    "the motion of the cool core could be used to discriminate among turbulence models we show that the gas velocities derived through the mock observations are consistent with the fe  k line emission weighted values inferred directly from hydrodynamic simulations .",
