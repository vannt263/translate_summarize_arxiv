    "formation of massive galaxies provides a critical test of theories of galaxy formation and evolution . before modern deep observations ,",
    "the most massive galaxies known were local elliptical galaxies with no ongoing star formation . the classical model for these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) was monolithic formation at high redshifts , followed by passive evolution . a more recent galaxy formation theory in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "paradigm @xcite predicts quite the opposite scenario : a galaxy - galaxy merging - tree model . in this scenario ,",
    "small galaxies formed early in cosmic time , and massive galaxies were assembled later at much lower redshifts by a series of mergers .",
    "observations of local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath5  ) @xcite ] detected by _ iras _",
    "are consistent with the merger theory .",
    "most local ulirgs have disturbed morphologies , consistent with being merging systems @xcite .",
    "ulirgs in later stages of merging have @xmath6 light profiles @xcite . @xcite and @xcite measured local ulirg dynamical masses and found an average of @xmath7  .",
    "these features are consistent with numerical simulation studies of galaxy mergers , indicating that local ulirgs are merging systems transforming gas - rich galaxies into @xmath8 elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the story is different at @xmath9 .",
    "deep near - infrared surveys @xcite have identified apparently luminous passive galaxies already in place at @xmath10 , implying that they formed at even higher redshifts .",
    "the existence of galaxies with @xmath11  at high redshifts may challenge the merger theory of forming such objects at lower redshifts .",
    "however , @xcite used a semi - analytic model to show that significant numbers of @xmath12 galaxies were in places by @xmath2 but many also formed at lower redshifts , that is , there was a whole `` downsizing '' trend for massive galaxies to form their stars early , but it is merely statistical not absolute . possibly consistent with this is the fact that the contribution of lirgs and ulirgs to the total ir luminosity density is more than 70% at @xmath13 @xcite compared to a negligible percentage locally @xcite .",
    "moreover , the redshift surveys for sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) by @xcite reveal a rapidly evolving ulirg population at @xmath14 .",
    "such strong evolution is also seen in ulirgs selected with _ bzk _",
    "color and mips 24  flux at @xmath2 with their number density apparently 3 orders of magnitude higher than the local number density",
    ". thus local ulirgs would well be the tail end of earlier intense activity .",

    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argued that 24  emission from galaxies at @xmath16 is powered by both active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star formation .",
    "spectroscopic observations of a few 24  luminous smgs and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath17 @xcite with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on spitzer support this view , showing both strong continua and emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) in the rest - frame @xmath18  .",

    ", @xcite and @xcite also identified samples with an apparent 1.6  stellar peak in the irac 4.5 or 5.8  bands .",

    "objects in these samples have much redder [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] irac colors than the majority of 24  sources ( fig .",

    "@xcite selected agn using similar criteria .",
    "they also selected a separate starburst - dominated sample at @xmath2 based on the stellar 1.6  emission bump .",
    "the exact criterion required the peak flux density to be at either 4.5  or 5.8  , thus rejects low - redshift galaxies and agn with strong power - law seds .",
    "the resulting sample is very similar to ours though overall a bit redder ( fig .",
    "[ f : cc ] ) .",
    "all objects in the @xcite starburst sample show strong pah emission features .",
    "irs observations of this sample are part of the gto program for the _ spitzer_/irac instrument team ( program i d :  30327 )",
    ". objects were observed only with the irs long - slit low - resolution first order ( ll1 ) mode , giving wavelength coverage @xmath50  with spectral resolution @xmath51 .",
    "the wavelength coverage corresponds to @xmath52  in the rest - frame for galaxies at @xmath53 .",
    "this wavelength range includes strong pah emission features at 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3  and silicate absorption from 8 to 13  ( peaking near 9.7  ) . detecting these features permits redshift measurement and study of dust properties .",
    "total exposure time for each target was based on its 24  flux density .",
    "mapping mode @xcite was used to place each object at 6 positions spaced 24  apart along the 168  irs slit .",
    "this not only gives more uniform spectra for the target objects , rejecting cosmic rays and bad pixels , but also increases sky coverage for possible serendipitous objects around each target .",
    "table  1 gives the target list and other parameters for the observations .",
    "all data were processed with the spitzer science center pipeline , version 13.0 .",
    "extraction of source spectra was done with both the smart analysis package @xcite and our customized software .",
    "lack of irs coverage at @xmath54  for this sample is compensated with deep _ akari _  15  imaging @xcite .",
    "all objects except two outside the _ akari _  area are detected at 15   providing measurement of the continua at rest - frame @xmath55  for galaxies at @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ f : spec ] presents the irs spectra .",
    "pah emission features at 7.7 and 11.3  and silicate absorption peaking at 9.7  are detected from 10 sources , indicating a narrow redshift range of @xmath56 .",
    "the pah emission features at 7.7 and 11.3  show pronounced variations in their profiles and peak wavelengths .",
    "both 7.7 and 11.3  pah features have at least two components @xcite . for example",
    ", the 7.7  pah feature has a blue component at 7.6  and a red component at wavelength longwards of 7.7  .",
    "thus different types of pah spectral templates potentially yield different redshift measurements . to check this ,",
    "we use two local mir spectral templates with different pah profiles , an average local starburst spectrum and an average local ulirg spectrum to determine redshifts .",
    "both templates yield very similar redshifts ( table  3 ) .",
    "the starburst template fits all objects better with a typical 2% redshift uncertainty .",
    "egs_b2 is identified at @xmath57 with pah emission features at 8.6 and 11.3  and the [ ] emission line at 12.81  .",
    "redshift @xmath58 for egs12 is confirmed by detecting @xmath59 at 1.992  ( figure  [ f : nir_spec ] ) in a nir spectrum taken with the moirc spectrograph on the subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of egs_b6 , however , shows two emission lines at 27.7 and 31.1  that we are not able to identify consistently with any redshift .",
    "egs_b6 is resolved to two objects 07 apart in the hst acs image @xcite , and an optical spectrum of this system shows two galaxies at @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we therefore omit egs_b6 from the sample for further analysis .",
    "the 24  images show several serendipitous objects in slits of all 12 targets , most of which are too faint to permit redshift identification .",
    "only one source , egs24a , have @xmath62  mjy .",
    "this object , found in the slit of egs24 , shows the silicate absorption feature at @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ f : spec ] ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the sample ( fig .",
    "[ f : zhist ] ) is very similar to that of the starburst - dominated ulirgs studied by @xcite , even though our limiting flux density at 24  is a factor of two fainter than theirs .",
    "recently @xcite use the same criteria to select a larger sample in the lockman hole region for the irs observation and yield a very similar redshift distribution .",
    "the narrow distribution for starburst - dominated ulirgs is due to the selection of strong 7.7  pah emission by the mips 24  band at @xmath1 .",
    "the peak of the redshift distributions for @xcite , @xcite , and our sample is at this redshift , confirming the selection effect .",
    "on the other hand , luminous 24  sources with power - law sed have a much wider redshift range up to @xmath15 @xcite , but they will not pass our irac color criteria or the `` bump '' sed criterion in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the pah features visible in the individual spectra of the sample galaxies are even more prominent in the average spectrum for the sample , as showed in fig  [ f : stack_sed ] , which also stacks local starburst @xcite and ulirg samples for comparison .",
    "the local ulirg sample is divided into seyfert , liner , and hii sub - samples according to their optical spectral classification @xcite .",
    "pah emission features are found have different feature profiles .",
    "@xcite classified profiles of each pah emission feature , according to the peak wavelength , into 3 main classes : class a , b , and c. pah emission features are known to have more than one component in each feature .",
    "for example , the 7.7  pah emission feature have two major components at 7.6 and 7.8  : class a is defined as 7.6  dominated pah ; class b is the 7.8  component dominated pah ; and class c is red component dominated with peak shifting beyond 7.8 .",
    "the 7.7  pah in the local starburst spectrum appears to be more consistent with class  a with the peak at wavelength shorter than 7.7  .",
    "all local ulirg spectra have a typical class  b pah profile , with a red wing extending beyond 8  . in  3.1 , we already found that the starburst template fits each irs spectrum of our sample better than the ulirg template .",
    "it is not surprising then that the average 7.7  pah profile of our sample is more similar to the average starburst spectrum , thus consistent with the class  a. another significant difference is that our ulirg sample has an average @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the 7.7 and 11.3  pah emission luminosities defined as @xmath66 ratio about twice as high as local ulirgs but similar to local starbursts @xcite .",
    "we also plot the average spectra of @xcite in figure  [ f : stack_sed ] for comparison .",
    "the average spectrum for strong pah objects in @xcite is more similar to the local seyfert type ulirg , implying a dominant agn contribution in the spectra of their sample .",
    "we conclude from irs stacking that the 7.7  pah profiles and @xmath64 ratios for the present sample are more consistent with those of local starburst galaxies rather than local ulirgs .",
    "pah emission features are a tracer of star formation , one of the energy sources powering ulirgs @xcite . in order to subtract the local continuum",
    ", we adopted the method used by @xcite , fitting the @xmath67  spectrum into three components : the pah emission features , a power - law continuum , and the silicate absorption .",
    "an iterative fit determined the continuum for each object .",
    "the initial input pah template was from the ngc  7714 irs spectrum after subtracting its power - law continuum .",
    "the silicate absorption profile was from @xcite with central optical depth @xmath68 a free parameter .",
    "the 7.7 and 11.3  pah line luminosities and equivalent widths for the local starburst sample @xcite , the local ulirg sample @xcite , and the present sample were derived the same way .",
    "@xcite used a different method to derive the same parameters ; their method would give lower 7.7  pah flux densities and luminosities .",
    "this is due to the complicated continuum at @xmath69 .",
    "our 11.3  pah flux densities are consistent with theirs .",
    "table  3 gives the results .",
    "aegis @xcite and fidel @xcite provide a rich x - ray to radio data set to study the ulirg seds .",
    "objects in our sample are measured at many key bands : all are detected in all four irac bands @xcite , all but two by _ akari _  at 15  @xcite , and all at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "most are also detected at 70 and 160  in the fidel survey @xcite .",
    "only two objects , egs14 and egs_b2 , are detected in the _ chandra _  200  ks x - ray imaging @xcite .",
    "the flux densities in these key bands trace stellar mass , star formation rate , and agn activity .",
    "objects in the present sample were also observed with mambo on iram , and most were detected at 1.2  mm @xcite .",
    "table  4 gives the photometry , and the uv - to - radio seds are shown in figure  [ f : sed ] .",
    "the multi - wavelength photometry permits us to compare the present sample with the sub - millimeter galaxy population .",
    "there is a small region covered by scuba in egs by @xcite , but no galaxies in the present sample are in the scuba region .",
    "we fit fir seds for the sample and predict their 850  flux densities @xmath71 to be in the range @xmath72mjy ( table  4 ) .",
    "these values are similar to the flux densities for smgs at the same redshifts @xcite .",
    "the median @xmath71 for this sample is 4.5 mjy , compared with the median @xmath71 of 5.5 mjy for smgs at @xmath73 found by @xcite and 7.5 mjy by @xcite . in more detail ,",
    "7 out 12 objects in the present sample have @xmath71 fainter than 5 mjy , while the flux densities for most smgs in @xcite and @xcite are brighter than 5 mjy .",
    "we therefore argue that this sample is part of a slightly faint smg population .",
    "optical and radio morphologies of the galaxies provide important information on their assembly histories .",

    "optical images of each object are presented with their seds in figure  [ f : sed ] .",
    "most objects have irregular or clumpy morphologies in the rest - frame @xmath75 bands with a typical size of 15 , suggesting extended star formation in a region with a size of about 13  kpc .",
    "the 1.4  ghz radio imaging of egs has a mean circular beam width of @xmath7638 fwhm @xcite and is unable to resolve morphologies except in a few cases .",
    "egs  23 and 24 show elongated radio morphologies aligned with their optical extent , indicating that the radio and rest - frame uv light are from the same extended star formation regions in both cases .",
    "the spatial distribution of the stellar population is traced by the rest - frame optical imaging .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have argued that uv - dominated star - forming galaxies at high redshifts have similar morphologies in the rest - frame uv and optical bands .",
    "one outstanding property of galaxies in the present sample is their extremely red optical - nir color .",
    "seven objects in the sample have observed @xmath77 , qualifying them as extremely red objects ( ero ) .",
    "egs4 is the reddest with @xmath78 .",
    "red colors like these are common among distant ulirgs ; examples include ero j164502 + 4626.4 ( = [ hr94 ]  10 or sometimes `` hr  10 '' ) at @xmath79 @xcite and cfrs  14.1157 at @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "eros are commonly seen as counterparts to smgs @xcite .",
    "the red optical - nir colors , corresponding to rest @xmath81 for our sample , indicate either dust extinction in these objects or high stellar mass .",
    "the stellar population modeling in the next paragraph suggests objects in our sample have both heavy dust extinction and high stellar masses .",
    "the heavy dust extinction does not seem to reconcile with objects being detected in the acs 606w and 814w bands , which are the rest - frame 1800 - 2600for galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the irregular and clumpy morphologies in figure  [ f : sed ] highly non - uniform dust extinction in the objects in our sample .",
    "only two objects are undetected in the deep acs 814w image , probably due to higher column density of dust in the compact stellar and gas distribution .",

    "in fact , two x - ray sources , egs14 and egs_b2 , and the serendipitous power - law source egs24a show higher radio excess ( lower _ q _ ) than rest objects in the sample .",
    "two scenarios can be differentiated by their radio morphologies : agns are point sources and mergers , in most cases , are extended sources .",
    "currently we can not determine which scenario is responsible to the radio excess due to lower resolution of the 1.4ghz radio images ( figure  [ f : sed ] ) .",
    "another measure used to estimate @xmath90 for local galaxies is the irac 8  luminosity , @xmath97 , though there is considerable debate about how reliable this method is .",

    "however , the @xmath101 relation for objects in our sample and the local ulirgs with high @xmath90 has a higher offset than that for the local starburst galaxies and the model prediction @xcite .",
    "this indicates that , for a given @xmath90 , @xmath97 for objects in our sample and some of local ulirgs is higher than the model prediction . thus objects in our sample have an 8  excess comparing with the ce01 and dh02 model prediction .",

    "our irs spectra can be used to separate the pah from continuum in the ( rest ) 8  band , and each component s contribution to @xmath97 can be measured .",

    "the hyperlirgs in @xcite and @xcite have the lowest @xmath102 ratio .",

    "the deficient pah emission in our sample implies most likely existence of agn in our sample , though strong uv from intensive star forming region can also destroy pah .    the mir spectral properties and @xmath3 of our sample are closer to local starburst galaxies , even though their @xmath90 differs by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion by comparing silicate absorption strength for their sample with those for local ulirg and starburst galaxies , and they propose six possible scenarios to explain the similarity between high redshift ulirgs and local starburst galaxies .",
    "our multi - wavelength data set provides further constrain on physical properties of our sample .",
    "the acs i - band images ( figure  [ f : sed ] ) show multi - clumpy morphologies extended to @xmath110  kpc size for most objects in our sample . at @xmath34 , the observed i - band probes the rest nuv band , thus is sensitive to star formation .",

    "the extended morphologies in rest nuv indicate an extended star formation in our sample , thus extended distribution of pah emission .",
    "in such an extended distribution , more pah can survive in strong uv radiation field from central agn than those in a compact distribution .",
    "this scenario thus explains the higher @xmath3 in our sample than local ulirgs .",
    "star forming galaxies at @xmath2 are found to generally have much less dust extinction than their local counterparts .",
    "@xcite found that there is a correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath112 for star forming galaxies at @xmath2 , where @xmath113 is the monolithic luminosity at 1600 .",
    "this correlation has a higher offset than the local relation , indicating less dust extinction in the line of sight for galaxies at @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite argued that dust distribution and star formation region become more compact in local galaxies .",
    "we argue that lower surface density of dust density and extended star formation region with high sfr permit to detect both uv and pah emission from most objects in ours sample .    the star formation rate for a galaxy can be estimated from its fir and ultraviolet emission .",

    "it is very possible that both can happen in one object simultaneously , namely its agn destroys pah in surrounding area where star formation occurs .",

    "@xcite showed that simulated galaxy populations taken from the milllennium simulation lightcones of @xcite and @xcite failed to re - produce the sfr - star mass relation at @xmath124 , thus underestimate number of ulirgs at @xmath2 .",
    "it has been long anticipated that ulirgs have a dominant contribution to the total infrared luminosity density , thus star formation rate density , at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath125 method to calculate the total infrared luminosity density for our sample to be @xmath126 . the sample of @xcite with the same limiting flux yields a density of @xmath127 .",
    "we argue that the difference is due to the cosmic variance , because these objects are massive galaxies and thus have a much stronger spatial correlation .",
    "both densities are lower than ulirg @xmath90 density at @xmath128 , @xmath129 for all ulirgs @xcite .",
    "most objects in our sample and those of @xcite have @xmath130 , the major contribution to the @xmath90 density at @xmath2 comes from ulirgs with @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "one direct way of identifying an object as an agn is to measure its x - ray luminosity .",
    "two objects in the sample , egs14 and egs_b2 , are in the main aegis - x catalog from the _ chandra _  200  ks images @xcite .",
    "their x - ray fluxes @xmath132 are @xmath133 and @xmath134  erg  @xmath135  s@xmath24 respectively . calculated",
    "x - ray luminosities @xmath136 @xcite are @xmath137  erg  s@xmath24 for egs14 and @xmath138  erg  s@xmath24 for egs_b2 .",
    "hardness ratios are 0.45 and -0.30 , respectively .",
    "therefore egs14 is a type  2 ( obscured ) agn , and egs_b2 is very close to a type  1 ( unobscured ) qso according to the x - ray luminosity and hardness ratios @xcite .",
    "in addition to egs14 and egs_b2 , egs1 has a low - significance x - ray counterpart . at the location of this source",
    "there were 6.5 net soft band counts ( 10 counts total with an estimated 3.5 count background ) .",
    "this gives a poisson probability of a false detection of @xmath139 .",
    "the source was not detected in the hard band .",
    "if the detection is real , egs1 has @xmath140  @xmath141  erg  @xmath135  s@xmath24 with @xmath142  @xmath143  erg  s@xmath24 , thus is qualified to be an agn .",
    "the remaining 10 ulirgs are not detected in the current chandra observation .",
    "stacking in the soft band gives 19.5 counts above an average background of 9.85 , corresponding to @xmath144  erg  @xmath135  s@xmath24 or @xmath145  erg  s@xmath24 at 2@xmath146 significance .",
    "there was no detection in the hard band .",
    "even if egs1 is added to the stacking , nothing shows up in the hard band , but the soft band detection significance rises to 3.2@xmath146 .",
    "the mean flux is @xmath147  erg  @xmath135  s@xmath24 or @xmath148  erg  s@xmath24 .",
    "this average x - ray luminosity represents either a very weak agn or strong star formation . using the relation of @xcite",
    ", this average x - ray luminosity corresponds to a star formation rate of 220 /yr , consistent with the sed and pah estimation .",
    "however , we argue that the stacked x - ray signal comes from central point sources .",
    "these objects have very extended and elongated morphologies in the rest - frame nuv band .",
    "if the x - ray photons are from these star formation regions , stacking would not yield any signal unless they are aligned .",
    "emission in the rest 36  wavelength range is another indicator of agn activity @xcite .",
    "the longer end of that range , which has minimal stellar and pah emission contamination , is ideal for detecting what is nowadays thought to be hot dust emission closely related to the agn accretion disk .",
    "luminosity at these wavelengths ( @xmath149 ) can be converted to @xmath90 for qsos with the qso sed templates @xcite .",
    "_ akari _  15  photometry @xcite provides the best measurement of @xmath149 for our sample .",
    "all galaxies within the _ akari _  coverage are detected except egs26 , for which the 3@xmath146 limiting flux density is @xmath150  @xmath30jy @xcite .",
    "the _ akari_15  band is wide enough to include the 6.2  pah feature for objects with @xmath73 , but this feature is much weaker than the 7.7  feature .",
    "thus the _ akari _  15  band is a better measure of agn emission than the mips 24  band .",
    "in fact , the @xmath151 ratio for our sample measures the continuum - to - pah ratio , and thus the agn fraction .",
    "figure  [ f : ratio ] shows this ratio versus redshift .",
    "the ratios for the two known agns with _ akari _",
    "coverage , egs14 and egs24a , are very close to the expected values for seyfert  2 s . egs11 and egs12 are similar to expectations for h  ii - type ulirgs .",
    "the flux ratios for the remaining objects in our sample show even more pah than starbursts , indicating starburst domination in these objects .",
    "smgs @xcite have very similar @xmath151 ratios as objects in the present sample , implying the same properties shared by both samples .",
    "the smgs also show very strong pah features in their irs spectra .",
    "this supports the argument that most objects in the present sample are part of a smg population , and are starburst dominated ulirgs .",
    "a starburst dominated ulirg can still have a deeply dust - obscured agn .",
    "many current theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that such a dust - obscured agn can have a significant contribution to @xmath90 of a ulirg . a study of local ulirg irs spectra show an average of 15% @xmath90 are from central dust - obscured agns @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that ulirg luminosity in @xmath152 is dominated by hot dust emission from agns .",
    "most objects in the present sample are detected at 15 thus permit to measure their rest 5  luminosities , @xmath153 , which trace agn activity .",
    "@xmath153 for the present sample is in range of @xmath154 ( table  4 ) . using @xmath155 from the @xcite qso",
    "sed , we calculate that such a qso contribution is about 14% of @xmath90 for objects in our sample , consistent with those for local ulirgs .",
    "the results for the present sample combined with others in table  1 show that high - redshift ulirgs have a diverse range of properties , and different selection criteria to pick out different populations . the combination of irac colors and mips 24  flux used here selects ulirgs with strong 7.7  pah in a rather narrow redshift range around @xmath156 .",
    "this sample shows a starburst dominated stage in gas - rich merging powered ulirgs at @xmath2 . in this stage",
    ", intensive star formation occurs in much extended region with a typical scale of @xmath157  kpc indicated by their acs morphologies .",
    "objects in this sample have higher total infrared luminosities than local ulirgs , but the @xmath3 ratios for the sample are higher than those of local ulirgs .",
    "we argue that the high @xmath3 ratio is due to the extended pah distribution , which is less affected by strong uv emission from central agns .",
    "most objects follows the same @xmath111-@xmath158 relation as that for bm / bx , drg and _ bzk _ galaxies , though they are at higher luminosity end .",
    "stellar masses in this sample already exceed @xmath7  .",
    "most stars must have formed prior to this stage .",
    "the sfr - stellar - mass relation for this sample is also consistent with that for the rest populations at @xmath2 , which is much higher than the theoretical model prediction .",
    "only a few of the ulirgs in our sample show direct evidence to have agns with either high x - ray luminosities or hot dust emission in the mid - infrared .",
    "several pieces of evidence show weak agns existing in this starburst dominated ulirg sample : systematically higher @xmath159 ratio than the local radio - fir relation , and an average x - ray emission of @xmath148  erg  s@xmath24 from point sources .",
    "agn contributes on average 15% of total infrared luminosity for our sample .",
    "this sample presents an early stage with very intensive star formation but weak or heavily obscured agns .",
    "ulirgs in other samples at similar redshift but with different selection methods @xcite have higher total infrared luminosities and lower pah luminosities , indicating increasing agn and decreasing star formation at higher @xmath90 .",

    "<S> this is the first starburst - dominated ulirg sample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly from fir and millimeter photometry , and as such gives us the first accurate view of broadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at all wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxy samples  local starburst galaxies , local agn / ulirgs , and a second 24-luminous @xmath2 sample dominated by agn . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 for the new @xmath2 starburst sample is the highest ever seen , some three times higher than in local starbursts , whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starburst trend , often severely . </S>",
    "<S> several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in this starburst dominated sample , except two of which even host very strong agn , while they still have very strong pah emission . </S>",
    "<S> the acs images show most objects have very extended morphologies in the rest - frame uv band , thus extended distribution of pah molecules . </S>",
    "<S> such an extended distribution prevents further destruction pah molecules by central agns . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that objects in this sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst ; and the total infrared luminosity density contributed by this type of objects is @xmath4 . </S>"
