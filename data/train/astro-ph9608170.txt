    "the ariel v and heao-1 surveys showed that the brightest class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the hard x - ray band are nearby , seyfert 1 galaxies . whilst it is unclear whether or not such sources are representative of the agn phenomenon in general , the high signal  to  noise ratio enables them to be studied them in most detail in the x - ray band .",
    "long term ( days to years ) variability is a property of these sources established early in the history of x - ray astronomy ( e.g. marshall , warwick & pounds 1981 ) , with variations in amplitude of factors up to an order of magnitude being common .",
    "only two sources showed evidence for more rapid variability in the heao-1 or _",
    "data ; ngc 4051 ( marshall  1983 ) and ngc 6814 ( tennant & mushotzky 1983 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the variability is most likely to be due to a nearby cataclysmic variable ( madejski  1993 ) .",
    "long duration , uninterrupted x - ray observations of agn were first afforded by _",
    "exosat _ , which showed that the previous lack of detection was due primarily to low signal - to - noise ratio and observation duration .",
    "_ exosat _ s highly elliptical orbit eliminated constraints due to earth occultation and saa passage for up to 4 days .",
    "examination of the light curves from short ( @xmath1 20,000 sec ) observations showed that rapid variability was common , contrary to the conclusions from low earth orbit satellites .",
    "( e.g. , lawrence  1985 ; pounds , turner & warwick 1986 ) . in a study of a sample of 48 seyfert galaxies , at least 30% showed clear rapid x - ray variability ( turner 1988 ) .    also provided the first evenly - sampled light curves of agn , and therefore an opportunity to estimate the power - density spectrum ( pds ) to reasonable accuracy .",
    "the pds can be used to identify characteristic time scales in the variability , which might be related to physical sizes in the source . however , early efforts showed scale - invariant variability , with a @xmath2 `` red - noise '' noise spectrum , possibly with @xmath3 ( lawrence  1987 ; mchardy & czerny 1987 ) .",
    "improved techniques have revealed further information .",
    "lawrence & papadakis ( 1993 ) reported on a series of _ exosat _ `` long  look '' observations and found that the power - spectrum slopes were consistent with a mean values of @xmath4 . using different techniques , green , mchardy & lehto ( 1993 ) presented similar results for a larger sample and found @xmath5 .",
    "however , both sets of authors presented evidence that the amplitude of the pds depends on the source luminosity , confirming a similar result based on the doubling time scale given by barr & mushotzky ( 1986 ) .",
    "green  ( 1993 ) also reported that the low - energy ( le ) power spectra of two sources were steeper than the medium ",
    "energy ( me ) spectra .",
    "it is still unclear whether there are any characteristic time scales in the x - ray variability of agn . with the best example of a periodicity - ngc 6814 - having evaporated , the strongest evidence is of quasi - periodic oscillations in the  power spectra of ngc 5548 and ngc 4051 ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "these observations await confirmation with other satellites .",
    "unfortunately , all the data taken since the demise of have been sampled unevenly . when combined with the relatively high poisson noise level associated with sources of this strength ,",
    "further progress in our knowledge of the power spectra has been severely hampered .",
    "after introducing our sample in section  [ sec : sample ] and our analysis methods in section  [ sec : anal ] , we discuss the imaging data in section  [ sec : im ] .",
    "we demonstrate the hard x - ray emission we describe here is consistent with an origin in a point - like source centered on the optical galaxy and is therefore associated with the agn , rather than some contaminating source .",
    "the time dependence of the x - ray emission of our seyfert 1 galaxies is discussed in section  [ sec : lc ] . finally , we discuss our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "here we present an analysis of  observations of seyfert 1 galaxies performed prior to 1994 may 01 .",
    "all such observations are now available in the public archives .",
    "we define seyfert 1 galaxies as agn at redshifts @xmath6 , with predominantly broad lines , as indicated by the seyfert 1.0 - 1.5 classification .",
    "we recognize that these distinctions are somewhat arbitrary and that our sources do not comprise a complete sample . in the early stages of any mission",
    ", the tendency is for the brightest x - ray sources to be observed , hence our sample consists primarily of hard x - ray selected agn from the heao-1 `` piccinotti sample '' ( piccinotti  1982 ) .",
    "the majority have been studied extensively in the hard x - ray band by _",
    "( mushotzky  1984 ) , _ exosat _ ( turner & pounds 1989 ) and  ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "analyses of higher - redshift and narrow - line agn will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our sample consists of 18 sources and is listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "histograms of the redshift and x - ray luminosity distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumin ] .",
    "the luminosities were calculated assuming a power - law fit to the spectra , @xmath7  km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as our intention is to study the mean properties of the sample we do not include a detailed discussion of individual sources .",
    "however , we note that many of these observations have been published in the literature already and the reader directed to the references noted in table  [ tab : obscat ] , and those therein , for analyses of the individual objects .",
    "detailed information regarding  and the analysis of data from that satellite can be found in tanaka , inoue & holt ( 1994 ) , day 1995 and references therein .",
    "four co - aligned , grazing - incidence , foil - mirror telescopes ( serlemitsos  1995 ) are employed to direct x - rays onto four focal - plane instruments simultaneously .",
    "there are two ccd detectors  the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ; gendreau 1995 ) and two gas  scintillation proportional",
    " counters  the gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ; tashiro  1995 ) .",
    "our  sis data were obtained in one of two data modes ( known as faint and bright ) , one of three clocking modes ( 1,2 or 4ccd modes ) depending on the number of ccd chips being read out and one of three telemetry modes ( low , medium and high bit rates ) .",
    "a given observation invariably contains a mixture of these modes .",
    "analysis of faint mode data alone allows correction for dark frame error ( dfe ) and `` echo '' effects ( otani & dotani 1994 ) , which permits utilization of the maximum energy resolution of the instruments .",
    "however , they can not then be combined with the bright mode data .",
    "thus , if signal - to - noise ratio is a more important consideration than spectral resolution , the faint data can be converted into a format identical to the bright mode data and thus the two types of data can be combined .",
    "combining data taken in different clocking modes can cause problems in the analysis , due to different background and ccd zero  levels and are generally not combined . in principle telemetry modes can be combined .",
    "the vast majority of the gis data described here were taken in so - called ph mode , which provides the maximum energy and spatial resolution .",
    "our data were obtained from the us public archive ( located at the heasarc , nasa / gsfc ) .",
    "table  [ tab : obscat ] shows the observation catalog .",
    "a total of 30 observation were made of our sources , where we define an `` observation '' as a distinct dataset within the archive .",
    "the starting point for our analysis were the `` raw '' event files from the database .",
    "these were created from the original telemetry file and have been corrected to produce linearized detector coordinates , gain corrected pulse  height values and sky co - ordinates determined from the spacecraft attitude .",
    "furthermore , the sis faint data have been converted to both bright mode format and an alternative form corrected for dfe and echo effects , and compressed in pha space , so - called bright2 data . in cases where the majority of the data were taken in faint mode",
    ", we adopted the bright2 data .",
    "otherwise we combined the faint mode data with the bright mode , to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the data modes we used are listed in column 4 of table  [ tab : obscat ] . in the case of mixed clocking modes",
    ", we chose only that mode with the highest exposure time .",
    "this is tabulated in column 5 of table  [ tab : obscat ] .",
    "the exception to this is mcg-2 - 58 - 22 , where we used the 2ccd mode data , as even though the exposure time in 4ccd mode was marginally greater , 2ccd mode is better calibrated .",
    "we excluded periods where telemetry saturation caused severe data dropouts .",
    "these usually occurred with 4ccd mode data in low bit - rate and such data were generally avoided , although in one case saturation occurred in 1ccd mode and another in medium bit - rate . otherwise , we combined the low , medium and high bit - rate data .",
    "we applied data selection and cleaning algorithms using the ascascreen script supplied with the ftools / xselect package version 3.4 .",
    "table  [ tab : screen ] shows the selection criteria which were applied to the datasets , unless otherwise noted in table  [ tab : obscat ] .",
    "flexible criteria ( such as br_earth , elv and ang_dist ) were determined from an examination of the housekeeping data . for the sis , the constraints on br_earth and elv were determined from an inspection of the sis event rates ( for the on - source chip : sis0 chip 1 or sis1 chip 3 ) as a function of these parameters . a marked increase in the event rate",
    "is observed below the angle where significant contamination occurs . in cases where the the attitude ( ang_dist ) varied wildly ( by @xmath10  arcmin ) during the majority of the observation , that observation was rejected . in two observations , the attitude was relatively stable , but the angle between the source and pointing position often exceeded the default criterion of ang_dist<0.01 used by ascascreen resulting in unacceptable data loss . in these cases we allowed ang_dist<0.02 .",
    "finally , we applied the standard algorithm to remove `` hot '' and `` flickering '' pixels from the sis data .",
    "the exposure times for the screened events files are listed in column 6 of table  [ tab : obscat ] .",
    "we have excluded observations where the exposure in either sis was less than 10ks to ensure a similar baseline for timing analysis and sufficient signal - to - noise ratio for spectral analysis .",
    "details of the the spectral analysis are presented in nandra  1996b ( hereafter paper ii ) and george  1996 ( hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "this left 23 observations suitable for further analysis .",
    "after extracting the event files we accumulated and examined the images for each instrument .",
    "the source centroids were generally within @xmath11  arcmin of the optical position of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : offset ] ) , which is consistent with the positional uncertainty due to attitude reconstruction errors ( gotthelf , priv . comm . ) .",
    "mrk 335 and ngc 4051 have larger offsets ( @xmath12  arcmin ) .",
    "nonetheless , in both cases we are confident that the agn are the sources of the x - rays observed by , as the  pspc positions , which are more accurate than those derived from the sis , are consistent with the optical nuclei , and show no other bright sources within the sis point ",
    "spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we did not find any evidence for extended emission , although this is not surprising considering the width of the psf . even at the distance of the closest galaxy , the half - power diameter ( hpd ) corresponds to a distance of @xmath13  kpc , much larger than the expected size of the nuclear x - ray source .",
    "visual inspection of the sis and gis images revealed six fields with evidence for sources other than the target .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : contam ] . in all cases",
    "these were much weaker than the seyfert and did not cause any serious problems in analysis .",
    "other , even weaker sources may be present in the images , but the presence of the central target , which is in general very bright , makes the application of point - source searching algorithms difficult .",
    "we have not therefore attempted any more sophisticated spatial analysis , but naturally , we avoided the visible contaminating sources when choosing source and background regions .    due to small calibration differences between the sis chips , we restricted our analysis to the primary on - source chip for each sis ( sis0 chip 1 and sis1 chip 3 ) .",
    "in most cases we used a circular extraction cell for the source region , typically @xmath14 arcmin in radius .",
    "however , in cases where the source centroid was close to the gap between sis chips , a circular extraction cell resulted in an unacceptable loss of counts . in these cases we employed rectangular extraction cells of a similar area .",
    "background for the sis was estimated using polygonal regions at the edge of the same chip .",
    "for the gis , the analysis was generally simpler and in all cases we adopted a circular source region centered on the agn .",
    "background counts were taken from source - free regions .",
    "initially , light curves of the source region were constructed for each observation using the xronos package . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we combined the sis0 and sis1 detectors when analyzing the sis data ; we also combined gis2 with gis3 . in order to maximize the light curve data thus obtained",
    ", we initially accumulated a light curve in 128s bins , requiring all such bins to be fully exposed in both instruments ( sis0/sis1 or gis2/gis3 ) .",
    "this ensured that sufficient counts were obtained in each 128s integration for gaussian statistics to be appropriate , even when the light curves were split into different energy ranges ( see below ) .",
    "we were then able to test for variability by means of a  test against the hypothesis that the flux was constant .",
    "the reduced-  values , , are quoted in table  [ tab : var - short ] for four light curves : sis0+sis1 full band ( 0.5 - 10 kev ; column 2 ) , gis2+gis3 hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ; column 3 ) , sis0+sis1 hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ; column 4 ) and sis0+sis1 soft band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ; column 5 ) .",
    "we excluded ngc6814 from this analysis , which was too weak to search for variations on these short timescales . for",
    "the remaining sources , variations in the background have a negligible effect on our analysis .",
    "we estimate that variability of the sis background would contribute less than @xmath15 to the @xmath16 values quoted in table  [ tab : rms ] and hence a negligible effect on the  values quoted in table  [ tab : var - short ] .    for the sis full - band light curve ( column 2 ) , 15 of the 17 objects tested showed short - timescale variability at @xmath17 per cent confidence .",
    "the exceptions to this are fairall-9 , which showed variability at @xmath18  per cent confidence and mcg-2 - 58 - 22 , which showed no significant changes . in almost all cases",
    "this variability is confirmed in the gis and in the hard and soft bands of the sis .",
    "we conclude that short - timescale variability is extremely common in seyfert 1 galaxies , albeit at low amplitude in some cases .    the full - band sis light curves are shown in fig .  [ fig : lc ] , and demonstrate a rich diversity of variability characteristics .",
    "for example , the individual sources exhibit different amplitudes of variability . to quantify this further ,",
    "we have calculated the normalized `` excess variance '' , @xmath16 of each light curve .",
    "we designate the count rates for the @xmath19 points in each light curve as @xmath20 , with errors @xmath21 .",
    "we further define @xmath22 as the unweighted , arithmetic mean of the @xmath20 .",
    "then :    @xmath23\\ ] ]    the error on @xmath16 , asymptotically for large @xmath19 , is given by @xmath24 ( m.g .",
    "akritas , priv .",
    "comm ) where :    @xmath25-\\sigma^{2}_{\\rm rms}\\mu^2\\ ] ]    i.e. the variance of the quantity @xmath26 .",
    "these values are given in table  [ tab : rms ] .",
    "as noted by lawrence & papadakis ( 1993 ) this parameter depends on the observation length .",
    "a more rigorous approach would be to define the amplitude and slope of the pds .",
    "unfortunately , however , such an analysis is extremely difficult with unevenly sampled data , as afforded by low - earth satellites such as .",
    "we justify our use of @xmath16 as a measure of the variability power by noting that the @xmath16 is correlated with the power - spectrum normalization in the  data ( lawrence & papadakis 1993 ) and that our observations are not radically different in duration ( table  [ tab : rms ] ) .",
    "there are clear differences between the sources .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] , @xmath27 shows a strong anti correlation with x - ray luminosity , confirming the previous results ( see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "note that the duration of the observation , @xmath28 , is not correlated with luminosity .",
    "we find @xmath29 , but with a substantial scatter , particularly for the objects around @xmath30  erg s@xmath8 .",
    "we note with interest , and discuss later , the fact that ngc 4151 shows evidence for changes in @xmath16 at different epochs .",
    "we have also employed the energy resolution of the sis detectors to compare @xmath16 for two separate energy bands .",
    "we compare the hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) and soft band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) variability in fig .",
    "[ fig : hs ] .",
    "there is clearly a strong correlation .",
    "however , we find that the amplitude of variability in the soft band is often greater than in the hard band .",
    "this implies spectral variability for these sources .",
    "in table  [ tab : var - orb ] we show tests against the constant hypothesis for light curves in 5760s bins ( approx 1 orbit ) for all our observations .",
    "the sources show even stronger evidence for variability on these @xmath1hr timescales , in all instruments and energy ranges .",
    "we were also able to test for variability in ngc 6814 on this timescale , but no evidence for significant flux changes was found .",
    "the @xmath16 values are not quoted for these light curves as there are generally insufficient points to make the error bars meaningful .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio of our  data allows us , in principle , to explore the pds in a regime not accessible to . above a frequency of @xmath31  hz",
    ", the latter data were dominated by poisson noise .",
    "the low background rate of the  detectors should allow us to go beyond this point , into the regime where we might expect cutoffs due to the fundamental size - scale of the x - ray source .",
    "however , the uneven sampling prevents construction of a reliable periodogram from our data .",
    "indeed , as noted before , even the @xmath16 values quoted above are susceptible to scatter due to the sampling patterns .",
    "we have tested for the presence of very rapid variability using light curves of the source accumulated in 32s bins , in the sis full band . even for the weakest sources , each bin contains @xmath32  counts , allowing gaussian statistics to be applied ( although once again , we excluded ngc 6814 from the analysis ) .",
    "we searched for contiguous segments with 5 or more bins in each 32s light curve , and performed a  test against a constant hypothesis for each segment , flagging each time the probability of obtaining that  by chance was @xmath33  per cent .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : var - rapid ] .",
    "we find at least one `` variable '' segment ( at @xmath17  per cent confidence ) in 10/23 observations and 9/17 of the sources .",
    "however , given that there are typically several tens of segments tested for each observation , the chance of spurious detections is fairly high .",
    "we consider there to be firm evidence for ultra - rapid variability if two or more segments show an unacceptable , which is true in 5/17 sources .",
    "unsurprisingly , these tend to be the sources with the largest overall variability amplitudes .",
    "for those sources with significant variability on these short time scales , we also tested the hypothesis that the high - frequency pds was constant in shape and intensity .",
    "we achieved this by calculating the excess variance for contiguous segments constructed to have the same duration .",
    "if the process producing the variability were statistically stationary , we would then expect these @xmath16 values to be constant . given that our prescription for the error bars on the excess variance",
    "is only valid in the limit of large @xmath19 , we used only segments with @xmath34 points .",
    "this requirement meant that we could not test the constancy hypothesis in ngc 4051 and ngc 3227 , since there were no such segments in the sis light curve .",
    "the  values and the probabilities of obtaining them are given in columns 5 and 6 of table  [ tab : var - rapid ] . in two cases ,",
    "mrk 766 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15(2 ) , we find an unacceptable  value , indicating that the high frequency pds in these sources is variable .",
    "although intriguing , we consider this result to be somewhat tentative , particularly in the case of mrk 766 ; some of the excess in that source comes from @xmath16 values which are less than zero . whilst these are expected by chance",
    ", they may be exaggerating the significance in this case .",
    "we have presented  imaging and timing data for a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies , most of which were originally detected by large - beam x - ray instrumentation .",
    "the  images demonstrate that , aside from the now infamous case of ngc 6814 , and despite the lack of spatial resolution of those instruments , the seyfert galaxies identified in the ariel - v and _ heao-1 _ surveys are indeed the sources of hard x - ray emission .",
    "there are weak contaminating sources in some cases , but none which have a measurable impact on our current analysis , or seem likely to have contaminated previous observations significantly .",
    "our sources show variability to be very common , albeit at very low amplitudes for some objects .",
    "this emphasizes the need for high signal - to - noise ratio observations ; this low - level variability was missed with most previous instrumentation .",
    "the rms variability amplitude is strongly anti - correlated with the x - ray luminosity of the source , but there is a substantial scatter .",
    "some of this could be due to the fact that the observation durations differ , although we note that the  data also showed a significant spread of power - spectrum normalizations about the correlation .",
    "were the sampling and power spectra identical for all sources then @xmath16 should be proportional to the amplitude of the pds at a given frequency .",
    "therefore we compare our correlation index of @xmath35 with that given by green  of 0.68 and lawrence & papadakis of 0.55 .",
    "the fact that these agree well , despite the expected deviations due to the sampling patterns , supports the result that the shapes of the power spectra are at least very similar from source to source , and that the effects of the observation duration are not severe .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the x - ray source in seyfert galaxies consists of a single , coherent region or of multiple `` hot spots '' , although the lack of any obvious characteristic time scale would tend to favor the latter ( e.g. , mchardy & czerny 1987 ) .",
    "in such a scenario , one could explain an anti - correlation of @xmath36 with @xmath37 by hypothesizing that the higher luminosity sources simply contained more hot spots , such that the large amplitude variability was `` washed out '' .",
    "we would then expect @xmath38 , which is somewhat steeper than the observed correlation , although we note that the scatter evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] makes precise determination of the relation difficult .",
    "nonetheless , our results , and those derived from the data , would tend to argue that the individual shots carried more power in the higher - luminosity sources , rather than simply being more numerous . alternatively , with a single x - ray - producing region , one might hypothesize that the luminosity is related to the size of that region .",
    "for example , if the source size is a fixed number of gravitational radii , we expect it to be proportional to the mass of the black hole . with a fixed accretion rate ( with respect to the eddington limit ) , , we would once again expect @xmath38 .",
    "our observed correlation would suggest that  increases with @xmath39 , a view supported by some recent and  spectral data for quasars ( stewart  1995 ; nandra  1996a ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission in our sources generally shows a larger amplitude of variability than the hard x - rays on the time scales considered . in this case",
    "the sampling is identical for the hard and soft x - ray light curves , so that if the power spectra were identical in the two bands , we would not expect significant differences in @xmath16 . to date , the power spectra in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. , the  le ) are not well known . for two sources with well - defined le power spectra , ngc 4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( which are also in our sample )",
    ", it appears that the power spectra are different in the soft and hard x - ray bands ( green  1993 ; papadakis & lawrence 1995 ) . for",
    "those sources the power spectra appear to be steeper in the soft x - ray band , although we note that in both cases there have been claims of quasi - periodic oscillations in the power spectra ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 ; papadakis & lawrence 1995 ) , making the spectral slope of the pds much more difficult to define .",
    "it is difficult to compare our result with theirs , as our @xmath16 represents an integration of the power spectrum over some frequency range , and can not be easily equated to the slope .",
    "we note , however , that , even in the soft x - ray band , the energy spectrum is probably dominated by the power law component ( see paper iii ) .",
    "therefore , we would anticipate the variability characteristics in the two bands to be similar .",
    "however , additional spectral complexity  and spectral variability  in the soft x - ray band could lead to additional variance .",
    "for example , changes in the ionization parameter or column density of a warm absorber ( e.g. halpern 1984 ; pan , stewart & pounds 1990 ) would have most effect in the soft x - ray band , as would any independently - variable soft excess ( e.g. turner & pounds 1988 ; such excesses are also clearly evident in a number of these spectra  see paper iii ) .",
    "we find evidence that ngc 4151 shows changes in @xmath16 in apparent contradiction to the suggestion that the process producing the variability is statistically stationary ( green  1993 ; papadakis & lawrence 1995 ) .",
    "lawrence & papadakis ( 1993 ) also found changes in @xmath16 between observations of ngc 4151 , but as they showed , the power spectra for those observations are consistent .",
    "indeed , we find here that the longest observation of ngc 4151(2 ) has the highest variance , which we expect as we are sampling the longer time scales .",
    "interestingly , however , a comparison of observations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) show the latter to have a higher variance , despite a shorter duration .",
    "this suggests that the shape and/or normalization of the power spectrum changes at different epochs .",
    "the other sources with multiple observations do not show clear evidence for variations in @xmath16 , when the observation durations are taken into account .",
    "we found evidence for variability power on frequencies higher than @xmath31  hz for five sources . in two cases",
    "there is also a suggestion that the variability amplitude changes during the observation .",
    "this indicates that the high - frequency pds in these sources is not constant .",
    "a variable pds might imply changes in fundamental time scales in the source .",
    "at the high frequency end , this might be related to the size - scale of the x - ray producing region(s ) .",
    "our observations suggest that it might be fruitful to pursue the study of the pds in the @xmath40  hz range with future instrumentation .",
