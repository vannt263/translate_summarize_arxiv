    "dark energy , the mysterious source driving the present acceleration of our universe , has been studied widely in the literature since its first discovery in @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "the dynamical dark energy models were proposed .",
    "for example , the quintessence , whose eos evolves with the cosmic time and satisfies @xmath18 @xcite , phantom with @xmath19 @xcite and k - essence with @xmath18 or @xmath20 @xcite . as addressed in literature",

    "quintom , whose eos can cross the cosmological constant boundary , is mildly favored by the observations and has been investigating extensively since its invention @xcite .",
    "our universe has experienced at least two different stages of accelerated expansion .",
    "one is the current acceleration driven by dark energy , the other is the inflation in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the mechanics of inflation can naturally explain the flatness , homogeneity and the isotropy of our universe .",
    "inflation stretches the primordial density fluctuations and seeds the presently observed large scale structures and cosmic microwave background radiation . in @xmath22 ,",
    "the wmap group claimed that the simple scale - invariant primordial spectrum does not fit well to the three - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the harrison - zeldovich - peebles scale invariant ( hz ) spectrum ( @xmath23 ) is disfavored about @xmath24 . and",

    "the aforementioned key cosmological questions might be answered by the virtue of the future high precision astronomical measurements .",

    "the angular resolution of planck measurement is three times superior to the current wmap observation and the noise is lowered by an order of magnitude at around @xmath28 ghz .",
    "these significant improvements permit much more accurate measurements of the cmb power spectra , so that planck has the very power and unique new capabilities to constrain the cosmological parameters . in ref.@xcite ,",

    "furthermore , dark energy perturbation plays a crucial role in the global fit @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is much more fair and reliable to do the error forecasts of the cosmological parameters in the framework of dynamical dark energy model rather than assuming a constant @xmath16 of de or the @xmath6cdm model . in this paper",

    "we label the above two dark energy parameterizations ( [ eos1 ] ) and ( [ eos2 ] ) as para i and para ii respectively throughout this paper .    when using the mcmc global fitting strategy to constrain the cosmological parameters , it is crucial to include dark energy perturbation .",

    "it leads to a rotation of the polarization vector of electromagnetic waves when they are propagating over cosmological distances .",
    "this effect is known as  cosmological birefringence \" .",
    "the polarization vector of each photon is rotated by an angle @xmath13 and one would modify the power spectra of te , ee , bb , tb and eb at the last scattering surface as : @xmath204 where the primed quantities are rotated . in ref.@xcite we have performed a global fit and found that a nonzero rotation angle of the photons is mildly favored , @xmath205 deg , using the wmap3 ( without the information of tb and eb power spectra ) and full data of boomerang-2k2 and @xmath206 .",
    "recently cabella _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a wavelet analysis of the temperature and polarization maps of the cmb delivered by the wmap experiment which includes the information of tb and eb power spectra .",
    "they obtained a limit on the cmb photon rotation angle @xmath207 deg . right now",
    "the wmap group has released their results of tb and eb power spectra .",
    "we plan to combine the full data of wmap3 ( including the information of tb and eb power spectra ) and boomerang-2k2 to reanalyze the rotation angle in the future @xcite . ] .    in fig.[fig7 ] , by the simulated data with planck and cmbpol accuracy , we find that the standard deviation of the rotation angle will be greatly tightened to @xmath208 deg for planck and @xmath209 deg for cmbpol .",
    "these results are much more stringent than the current constraint and will be used to verify the _ cpt _ symmetry with a higher precision @xcite .",
    "since the mystery of our universe encodes in the cosmological parameters , constraining these parameters with the latest observational data and doing error forecasts with the simulated futuristic data can lead us to understand the nature . in this paper , we focus on the dynamics of dark energy in light of current and simulated planck and snap data and then constrain the inflationary parameters , total neutrino mass and curvature of space - time in the framework of dynamical dark energy model . in addition",
    ", we investigate the rotation angle @xmath13 , the possible signature of _ cpt _ violation , by simulated planck and cmbpol data .",
    "parameterizing the eos of dark energy in two forms as eqs.([eos1],[eos2 ] ) , we find that the quintom model , whose eos crosses @xmath17 during the evolution , is mildly favored by latest observations , albeit the @xmath6cdm model remains a good fit . using the simulated planck data complimented by snap data , we find that the variance of the dark energy parameters in eq.([eos1 ] ) decreases dramatically , namely , @xmath210 and @xmath211 can be reduced by a factor of @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively .",
    "given the current central value , this means that planck can distinguish dynamical dark energy from the @xmath6cdm model at around 4@xmath12 confidence level .",
    "since the dynamics of dark energy greatly affects the determination of other cosmological parameters , we constrain the inflationary parameters , total neutrino mass @xmath4 and curvature of space - time @xmath5 with the presence of dynamics of dark energy using current and simulated observational data .",
    "we find that the dynamics of dark energy generally weakens the determination of other cosmological parameters .",
    "for instance , we find that the inflation models with a  blue \" tilt ( @xmath214 ) , which is strongly disfavored in the @xmath6cdm model , are now well within @xmath7 region in the framework of dynamical dark energy model .",
    "this is something intriguing in that hybrid inflation models have been revived due to the dynamical dark energy , due to the obviously enlarged parameter space of ( @xmath1,@xmath3 ) in the framework of dynamical dark energy model .",
    "these discoveries can lead us to further study the dynamics of inflation , dark energy and the relationship between them . with planck ,",
    "the uncertainties of inflationary parameters , including @xmath215 , can be roughly reduced by a factor of @xmath172 .",
    "this significant improvement make it possible to distinguish the inflationary models decidedly",
    ".    the presence of dark energy can relax the upper limit of neutrino mass by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "this sheds new light on the research of neutrino physics , such as the scenario of mass varying neutrino @xcite . by planck",
    ", we can rise the precision of measurement of this mass limit by a factor of @xmath217 , namely , the standard deviation of neutrino mass can be shrunk to @xmath195 for the @xmath6cdm model and @xmath218 for the dynamical dark energy model ( para  i ) .",
    "this measurement might make us understand the nature of physics conclusively .",
    "current data imply that our universe is very close to flatness , say , @xmath11 . by planck",
    ", we can reduce @xmath219 by a factor of @xmath220(@xmath6cdm ) .",
    "such improvement helps us to reveal the nature of space - time .",
    "the global symmetry of _ cpt _ plays a critical role in understanding the fundamental physics . in our previous works",
    "we have found some hints of _ cpt _ violation encoded in the rotation angel of polarization vector of photons @xmath13 . with planck and cmbpol , we can test the _ cpt",
