    "in the past idealized models for turbulent fluctuations which can be found in the solar wind plasma or in the interstellar medium have been proposed ( e.g. matthaeus et al .",
    "we are concerned with statistically axisymmetric models of magnetostatic fluctuations @xmath0 that are transverse to a uniform mean magnetic field @xmath1 . if solar wind turbulence is considered , the mean field might be identified with the magnetic field of the sun .",
    "the total magnetic field is a superposition of this mean field and the fluctuations @xmath2 .",
    "whereas we usually approximate the mean field by a constant field aligned parallel to the @xmath3axis ( @xmath4 ) , the turbulent contribution has to be replaced by turbulence models .",
    "some prominant examples are slab , 2d , and two component models that include both slab and 2d contributions ( e.g. matthaeus et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "there are recent spacecraft measurements of magnetic correlations in the solar wind ( see e.g. matthaeus et al .",
    "2005 , dasso et al . 2007 ) .",
    "such measurements are very interesting and important since they allow an improved understanding of turbulence .",
    "for instance , characteristic length scales of turbulence such as the correlation length , the bendover scale , and the dissipation scale can be obtained from such observations .",
    "also the investigation of spectral anisotropy by using data from different space craft missions such as wind and ace is possible .",
    "these properties of solar wind turbulence are very important for several investigations ( heating and damping of the solar wind plasma , transport of charged cosmic rays ) .",
    "a further important turbulence property is the turbulence dynamics ( the time dependence of the stochastic magnetic fields ) . in principle ,",
    "data sets from wind and ace can also be used to compute dynamical correlation functions to explore the turbulence dynamics .    in a recent article ( shalchi 2008 )",
    "magnetic correlation functions were computed analytically .",
    "such analytical forms of magnetic correlations complement data analysis results such as matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and dasso et al .",
    "since we expect that future data analysis work will also allow the investigation of temporal correlation functions , we explore theoretically ( numerically and analytically ) the forms of these eulerian correlations .",
    "these results can be compared with data analysis results as soon as they are available .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we define and discuss the basic parameters which are useful for describing turbulence .",
    "furthermore , we explain the slab , the 2d , and the slab/2d compositel model . in section 3",
