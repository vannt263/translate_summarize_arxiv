    "`` perfect fluidity '' of the created matter at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in bnl is one of the most exciting news in the field of high energy nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "experimental results and their comparison with theoretical calculation reveal that the matter created at au+au collisions should be something like a liquid of quarks and gluons , unlike a gas of almost free partons as naively expected @xcite .",
    "one of the strong evidences of this finding is an observation of large elliptic flow ( @xmath1 ) and its agreement with a perfect fluid - dynamical calculation @xcite . in order to reproduce the experimental result with such models , an equation of state assuming partonic state at high temperature and a phase transition and rapid thermalization time ( @xmath2 )",
    "are required @xcite .",
    "now the hydrodynamic model based on numerical solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamic equation for perfect fluid becomes an indispensable tool for theoretical analyses of the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the model itself has been becoming more sophisticated to reproduce new experimental data with high statistics .",
    "current most sophisticated ones are full three - dimensional ( solving hydrodynamic equation without any symmetry ) hydrodynamic expansion followed by a hadronic cascade @xcite .",
    "these models can reproduce most of soft hadronic observables .",
    "especially , simultaneous description of particle ratios , transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow is possible with such hybrid models .    however , there are still some insufficient ingredients in the hydrodynamic analyses .",
    "first , we do nt have a reasonable initial condition derived from the first principle .",
    "recently , the color glass condensate ( cgc ) has been proposed as a suitable initial condition for relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this picture has been examined as an initial condition for a hydrodynamic model in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to give a good description of some observables in the case of fully hydrodynamic description of the collision process .",
    "however , this initial condition fails if one takes hadronic dissipation into account @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests there is still an open space for dissipative partonic phase , or improvement of the initial condition .",
    "second , the equation of state ( eos ) of the qcd matter has not been fully understood yet . since",
    "one of the most important merit of using hydrodynamic models is that it can be directly related to the eos , detailed information on the eos for all region of temperature and baryonic chemical potential is indispensable . as for the rhic energy ,",
    "net baryon number observed at midrapidity is small enough to neglect it @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , eos at finite baryonic chemical potential may play important role at forward rapidity region and heavy ion collisions at lower energies . because of a well - known difficulty of lattice qcd at finite baryonic chemical potential @xcite , lattice qcd calculation has not provided the complete solution yet . for vanishing baryonic chemical potential , the lattice equation of state clearly shows a different behavior from the free parton gas @xcite and a lattice - inspired eos is implemented in a hydrodynamic calculation @xcite .    at last , in spite of the success in most of soft observables , results of the two - pion momentum intensity correlation from such hydrodynamical models do not agree with experimental data yet . according to the symmetry of the wave function of two identical bosons ,",
    "the two - particle correlation function can be related to sizes of the source from which particles are emitted .",
    "this fact is known as hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) effect . because it concerns with source sizes , which depend on momentum of particle pairs due to collective flow",
    ", the pion correlation function should be a diagnostic tool for the space - time evolution of the matter .",
    "since the disagreement was firstly found with a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model with boost invariance along the collision axis @xcite , many extensions such as an explicit longitudinal expansion @xcite , incorporating chemical freeze - out @xcite , chiral model eos @xcite , opaque source @xcite , fluctuating initial conditions and continuous freeze - out @xcite have been examined and the discrepancy has been getting improved , but the situation is still unsatisfactory .",
    "there are various possibilities for further improvements .",
    "so far discussion on the hbt radii at the rhic has been limited to midrapidity because of acceptances of two experiment , star and phenix .",
    "phobos also has measured the two - pion correlation function . by virtue of the wider acceptance of the detector ,",
    "measurements at non - zero rapidity windows can be done , and the data are now available in ref .  @xcite . for analyses of such data in terms of the cartesian parameterization @xcite , it should be noted that there exists an additional hbt radius called `` out - long cross term '' @xcite which vanishes at midrapidity due to the symmetry .",
    "this radius contains information on the correlation between freeze - out points on the transverse plane and those on the longitudinal direction .",
    "hence , it is expected that this quantity is sensitive to longitudinal expansion dynamics beyond boost - invariant approximation .",
    "similar consideration also holds for the yano - koonin - podgoretski parametrization which has three radius parameters and one velocity parameter called yk velocity @xcite .",
    "the phobos data also provide rapidity dependence of the ykp radii and yk velocity @xcite , which may impose a restriction on the longitudinal expansion dynamics .",
    "indeed , the initial matter distribution as an input for hydrodynamic calculations has not been fixed yet .",
    "this is indicated by hirano in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which two different initial energy density distributions can provide reasonable agreement with experimental data of pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons measured in 130@xmath3 gev au+au collisions at rhic .    in this work",
    ", we employ two different initial energy density distributions for the hydrodynamic equations , as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we focus our discussion on central collisions .",
    "both of them are so tuned that they reproduce the pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons measured in the most central events at 200@xmath3 gev au+au collisions .",
    "then we compare the space - time evolution and shape of the freeze - out hypersurface of the fluids and see how the difference in the initial condition is reflected onto them .",
    "we calculate the two - pion correlation function as the most promising experimental observable to see the difference . extracting the hbt radii through gaussian fits ,",
    "we compare them with the experimental results and discuss the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the hbt radii . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the hydrodynamical model used in this work .",

    ", we consider the baryon number charge as a conserved charge and adopt an equation of state which exhibits a first order phase transition on the phase boundary in @xmath14 plane from the free massless partonic gas with three flavors to the free resonance gas which consists of hadrons except for hyperons up to 2 gev/@xmath15 of mass with excluded volume correction @xcite . ] .",

    ", we explicitly solve the entropy and baryon number conservation law .",
    "we checked that these quantities are conserved throughout the numerical calculation within 1% of accuracy for a time step @xmath26 fm/@xmath27 , by choosing proper mesh sizes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions .",
    "firstly , we choose an initial proper time as @xmath30 fm/@xmath27 .",
    "initial values for other variables are given on this hyperbola .",
    "longitudinal flow rapidity is set to the bjorken s scaling ansatz @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "transverse flow is simply neglected at the initial proper time . for the matter distributions , we assume that the energy and baryon number density are proportional to the number of binary collisions . hence , for the woods - saxon profile of nucleon density in nuclei @xmath32 where @xmath33 fm is the radius of the nuclear with mass number @xmath3 , @xmath34 fm is the surface diffuseness and @xmath35 is the normal nuclear matter density , the density of binary collisions at vanishing impact parameter is given by @xmath36 ^ 2,\\label{eq : bin}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 being the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section which is absorbed into the proportionality constant between @xmath38 and matter distributions .",
