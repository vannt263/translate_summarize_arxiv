    "the ordered two- and three - dimensional structures of charged particle systems are investigated in numerous recent studies @xcite , in particular , wigner crystallization in a quasi-3d electronic system @xcite and the holes in semiconductors @xcite are also actively studied . in the paper @xcite the authors dealt with a two - dimensional wigner crystal classically as with elastic medium . in this case the elastic restoring force in the equation of motion is @xmath0 and the external driving force on the total charge density is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the real - space dynamic matrix tensor , @xmath3 is the two - dimensional displacement of the wigner crystal , @xmath4 is its density , @xmath5 is the external electric field .    in this paper",
    "we extend the idea presented in  @xcite to a three - dimensional boundless wigner crystal  @xcite .",
    "we consider a low - frequency long - wave electromagnetic field in the wigner crystal .",
    "a usual definition of an acoustic wave is the following : an acoustic wave is a joint collective motion of the valence electrons and ions of lattice in a self - consistent electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , we have electron lattice and assume that ions are free as in the jellium model .",
    "we consider a mean electromagnetic field in an acoustic wave and ignore a dissipation .",
    "in the case of long acoustic waves , it is possible to rewrite the elastic restoring force in the form @xmath6 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 is the tensor of the elastic modules of an electron subsystem . to simplify consideration",
    ", we assume that the wigner crystal is isotropic one . then using lame parameters it is possible to write down @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the similar consideration was given in @xcite for metals .",
    "it is known that in the case of an ideal crystal without defects of type of vacancies or interstitials , that is exactly the case we investigate , velocity of environment points coincides with the derivative of their displacement with respect to time @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the electrons oscillate around their equilibrium positions in the lattice .",
    "short - acting forces , correlating separate oscillations , act between them . in the study of long waves it is possible to unite equation of motion of elastic subsystem , where short - acting interelectronic potential @xmath10 appears @xcite , that gives the elastic modules , with the long - wave self - consistent electric field . in the absence of external magnetic field the relativistic term of the lorentz force can be omitted .",
    "therefore , an equation of motion for electronic component can be written in the form @xmath11 a self - consistent electric field satisfies the maxwell equations with a hydrodynamic approximation for the current components @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the corresponding charge  @xcite .",
    "for simplicity all ions are assumed to be identical and have valence @xmath14 .",
    "we do nt consider the piezoelectric or the magnetic matters .",
    "we ignore thermal motion of the ions , and using the jellium model we have the the equation of motion for an ionic component @xmath15 it means that the wigner crystal is an elastic electron environment that contains `` raisins''-ions . equations ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and the maxwell equations for a self - consistent electromagnetic field will allow us to unite the consideration of solid and collective effects .",
    "we consider the adiabatic sound waves of small amplitude starting from the obtained system of equations .",
    "for this purpose we linearize equations of the system near the equilibrium state , where all variables , namely , field strengths and component velocities , are equal to zero .",
    "then the first maxwell equation @xcite takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equilibrium value of density of the proper particles .",
    "the faraday equation is linear and , therefore , remains the same @xmath18 in this system it is convenient to pass to the fourier - components by the following rule @xmath19 then we obtain the system of five linear homogeneous equations @xmath20 - 4\\pi ( ze{n_{i0}}{{\\bf{v}}_i",
    "} - e{n_{e0}}{{\\bf{v}}_e}),\\quad { \\bf{\\dot b } } = - ic[{\\bf{k}},{\\bf{e } } ] , \\quad { \\bf{\\dot u } } = { { \\bf{v}}_e},\\\\ { \\rho _ { i0}}{{\\bf{\\dot v}}_i } = ze{n_{i0}}{\\bf{e}},\\quad { \\rho _ { e0}}{\\dot v_{e\\alpha } } =   - \\left ( { \\lambda + \\mu } \\right){k_\\alpha } \\left ( { { \\bf{ku } } } \\right ) - \\mu{u_\\alpha } { k^2 } - e{n_{e0}}{e_\\alpha } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is observed that the system for potential and vortical oscillations is divided into two subsystems .",
    "we project all variables on the wave vector @xmath21 and introduce the notations for projections using the rule @xmath22",
    ". then the system takes the form @xmath23    it is obvious that the magnetic field does not influence on the potential motion .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the plasma frequency of corresponding particles as @xmath24 we will choose new variables so that the resulting differential equation has no dimensions using the rules @xmath25 where @xmath26 in the dimensionless variables the latter system takes the form @xmath27 in general , the system ( [ 10b ] ) gives a biquadratic characteristic equation , but we have to take into account the smallness of frequency of sound oscillations . as we study long acoustic waves ( with a condition @xmath28 ) , the solution with frequency @xmath29 ( here we have taken into account , that @xmath30 ) , that corresponds to high - frequency plasma waves , is not interesting .",
    "the eigenvectors show that electric field , displacement and both velocities perform coupled oscillations .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath31 , corresponding to low - frequency branch of oscillations , are given by @xmath32 which in limit @xmath33 gives the solution @xmath34 now we return to the dimensional variables and rewrite the frequency of sound with a dispersion as @xmath35 the velocity of longitudinal sound @xmath36 is determined by mass of ions , in analogy to the ion sound in a two - temperature plasma @xcite .",
    "further , we consider the transversal oscillations .",
    "for this purpose we project equations ( [ 10 ] ) on @xmath37 , introducing notations by the rule @xmath38 it is convenient to pass from induction of the magnetic field to the new variable @xmath39 = { \\bf{z}}$ ] @xcite . in analogy with the longitudinal subsystem",
    "we pass to dimensionless variables using the rules @xmath40 where @xmath41 in the dimensionless variables we have the system @xmath42 the eigenvectors show that all physical variables perform coupled oscillations .",
    "the eigenvalues that correspond to low - frequency branch of oscillations are @xmath43 in the limit @xmath44 for the condition @xmath45 this gives the transversal sound @xmath46 however , in the area @xmath47 there is the quadratic dispersion @xmath48    returning to the dimensional variables we obtain low - frequency mode @xmath49 equation ( [ lt ] ) demonstraits non - linearity for middle wavelengths ( see apendix ) . expressions ( [ 15 t ] ) and ( [ lt ] ) approach to the sound , in supposition @xmath50 , with dispersion @xmath51 therefore , the velocity of transversal sound is @xmath52 it is easy to see that the velocities satisfy the well - known requirement @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "now , starting from systems ( [ 10b ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) , it is easy to show that expressing velocities of subsystems of charges from equations of motion through the fields and substituting them in the corresponding wave equation obtained from the maxwell equations , the sound oscillations reduce to oscillations of the electric field in the crystal .",
    "the quanta of the obtained sound oscillations are the quanta of the electromagnetic field in the crystal . that gives correct statistics for phonons , as bosons with zero chemical potential .",
    "therefore , it is possible in standard way to introduce operators of annihilation and creation of phonons as quanta of the electromagnetic field after the decomposition of the vector potential of electromagnetic field on plane waves @xmath54 @xcite , where the index @xmath55 denotes longitudinal and two transversal polarizations .",
    "using the jellium ( continuum ) model of a solid by introducing an elasticity of electronic subsystem for a wigner crystal , we have found the longitudinal and two transversal low - frequency oscillation brunches .",
    "we have shown that these sound oscillations in a wigner crystal can be considered as the coupled waves of the electromagnetic field and charges which it is possible to study as waves of the electromagnetic field in an environment .",
    "it gives phonons with necessary statistics after the standard quantization of the field .",
    "for numerical estimation we take the average inter - particle spacing of order @xmath56 @xcite , where @xmath57 is the bohr radius .",
    "then an electronic plasma frequency is @xmath58 and let an ionic one be @xmath59 .",
    "we estimate shear modulus using coulomb interaction as @xmath60 and from ( [ 28 ] ) obtain @xmath61 . in this supposition",
    "we get the numerical estimation for low - frequency mode ( [ lt ] ) @xmath62 and plot this dispersion dependence ."
