    "outliers are observations that depart from the pattern of the majority of the data .",
    "identifying outliers is a major concern in data analysis because a few outliers , if left unchecked , can exert a disproportionate pull on the fitted parameters of any statistical model , preventing the analyst from uncovering the main structure in the data .    to measure the robustness of an estimator to the presence of outliers in the data ,  @xcite introduced the notion of finite sample breakdown point . given a sample and an estimator , this is the smallest number of observations that need to be replaced by outliers to cause the fit to be arbitrarily far from the values it would have had on the original sample .",
    "remarkably , the finite sample breakdown point of an estimator can be derived without recourse to concepts of chance or randomness using geometrical features of a sample alone  @xcite .",
    "recently ,  @xcite introduced the projection congruent subset ( pcs ) method .",
    "pcs computes an outlyingness index , as well as estimates of location and scatter derived from it .",
    "the objective of this paper is to establish the finite sample breakdown of these estimators and show that they are maximal .",
    "formally , we begin from the situation whereby the data matrix @xmath0 , is a collection of @xmath1 so called @xmath2 observations drawn from a @xmath3-variate model @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "however , we do not observe @xmath0 but an @xmath6 ( potentially ) corrupted data set @xmath7 that consists of @xmath8 observations from @xmath0 and @xmath9 arbitrary values , with @xmath10 , denoting the ( unknown ) rate of contamination .",
    "historically , the goal of many robust estimators has been to achieve high breakdown while obtaining reasonable efficiency .",
    "pcs belongs to a small group of robust estimators that have been designed to also have low bias ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) . in the context of robust estimation , a low bias estimator reliably finds a fit close to the one it would have found without the outliers , when @xmath11 with @xmath12 . to the best of our knowledge , pcs is the first member of this group of estimators to be supported by a fast and affine equivariant algorithm ( fastpcs ) enabling its use by practitioners .",
    "the rest of this paper unfolds as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    ", we detail the pcs estimator . in section  [ s3 ] ,",
    "we formally detail the concept of finite sample breakdown point of an estimator and establish the notational conventions we will use throughout .",
    "finally , in section  [ s4 ] , we prove the finite sample breakdown point of pcs .",
    "consider a potentially contaminated data set @xmath0 of @xmath1 vectors @xmath13 , with @xmath14 . given all @xmath15 possible @xmath16-subsets @xmath17",
    ", pcs looks for the one that is most _ congruent _ along many univariate projections .",
    "formally , given an @xmath16-subset @xmath18 , we denote @xmath19 the set of all vectors normal to hyperplanes spanning a @xmath3-subset of @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , all directions @xmath20 define hyperplanes @xmath21 that contain @xmath3 observations of @xmath18 . for @xmath20 and @xmath22 , we can compute the squared orthogonal distance , @xmath23 , of @xmath24 to the hyperplane defined by @xmath25 as @xmath26the set of the @xmath16 observations with smallest @xmath27 is then defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath16th - order statistic of a vector @xmath30 .",
    "we begin by considering the case in which @xmath31 . for a given subset @xmath18 and direction @xmath25",
    "we define the _ incongruence index _ of @xmath18 along @xmath25 as @xmath32with the conventions that @xmath33 .",
    "this index is always positive and will be smaller the more members of @xmath18 correspond with , or are similar to , the members of @xmath34 . to remove the dependency of equation on @xmath25",
    ", we measure the incongruence of @xmath18 by considering the average over many directions @xmath35 as @xmath36 the optimal @xmath16-subset , @xmath37 , is the one satisfying the pcs criterion : @xmath38 then , the _ pcs estimators of location and scatter _ are the sample mean and covariance of the observations with indexes in @xmath37 : @xmath39    finally , we have to account for the special case where @xmath40 . in this case , we enlarge @xmath37 to be the subset of all observations lying on @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 .",
    "+      to give additional insight into pcs and the characterization of a cloud of point in terms of congruence , we provide the following example .",
    "figure  [ fig : dataplot ] depicts a data set @xmath43 of 100 observations , 30 of which come from a cluster of outliers on the right . for this data set , we draw two @xmath16-subsets of 52 observations each .",
    "( @xmath44 ) are depicted as dark blue diamonds ( light orange circles).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    subset @xmath45 ( dark blue diamonds ) contains only genuine observations , while subset @xmath44 ( light orange circles ) contains 27 outliers and 25 genuine observations .",
    "finally , the 17 observations belonging to neither @xmath16-subset are depicted as black triangles . for illustration s sake",
    ", we selected the members of @xmath44 so that their covariance has smaller determinant than @xmath46 @xmath16-subsets formed of genuine observations . consequently",
    ", robust methods based on a characterization of @xmath16-subsets in terms of density alone will always prefer the contaminated subset @xmath44 over any uncontaminated @xmath16-subset ( and in particular @xmath45 ) .    the outlyigness index computed by pcs differs from that of other robust estimators in two important ways .",
    "first , in pcs , the data is projected onto directions given by @xmath3 points drawn from the members of a given subset , @xmath18 , rather than indiscriminately from the entire data set .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that when @xmath47 and/or @xmath3 are high , the vast majority of random @xmath3-subsets of @xmath48 will be contaminated .",
    "if the outliers are concentrated , this yields directions almost parallel to each other . in contrast , for an uncontaminated @xmath18 , our sampling strategy always ensures a wider spread of directions and this yields better results .",
    "the second feature of pcs is that the congruence index used to characterize an @xmath16-subset depends on all the data points in the sample .",
    "we will illustrate this by considering all @xmath49 members of @xmath50 . for each , we compute the corresponding value of @xmath51 .",
    "then , we sort these and plot them in figure  [ fig : icompare ] .",
    "we do the same for @xmath44 .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath52 .     for @xmath45 and @xmath44 , shown as dark blue ( light orange ) lines.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "consider now in particular the values of the @xmath53-index corresponding to @xmath45 and starting at around 1050 on the horizontal axis of figure  [ fig : icompare ] .",
    "these higher values of @xmath54 correspond to members of @xmath50 that are aligned with the vertical axis ( i.e. they correspond to horizontal hyperplanes ) , and are much larger than the remaining values of @xmath54 .",
    "this is because , for the data configuration shown in figure  [ fig : dataplot ] , the outliers do not stand out from the good data in terms of their orthogonal distances to hyperplanes defined by the vertical directions .",
    "as a result , this causes many outliers to enter the sets @xmath34 and this deflates the values of the @xmath55 corresponding to these directions .",
    "since the set @xmath45 is fixed , there is no corresponding effect on @xmath56 so that the outliers will influence the values of @xmath54 for some directions @xmath25 , even though @xmath45 itself is uncontaminated .",
    "this apparent weakness is an inherent feature of pcs . in the remainder of this note , we prove the following counter - intuitive fact : outliers influence the value of @xmath57 , even when @xmath18 is free of outliers , yet , so long as there are fewer than @xmath58 of them , their influence on the pcs fit will always remain bounded . in other words ,",
    "breakdown only occurs if @xmath59 ( see section  [ s4 ] ) .",
    "to lighten notation and without loss of generality , we arrange the observed data matrix @xmath60 with rows @xmath61 so that the @xmath62 of contaminated observations @xmath63 are in the last @xmath64 rows and the uncontaminated observations @xmath65 in the first @xmath66 rows .",
    "then , @xmath67 will refer to the set of all corrupted data sets @xmath7 and @xmath68 is the set of all @xmath16-subsets of @xmath69 , @xmath70 the set of all @xmath16-subsets of @xmath69 with at least one contaminated observation , and @xmath71 the set of all uncontaminated @xmath16-subsets of @xmath69 .    the following assumptions ( as per , for example  @xcite ) all pertain to the original , uncontaminated , data set @xmath0 . in the first part of this note , we will consider the case whereby the point cloud formed by @xmath72 lies in _ general position _ in @xmath73 .",
    "the following definition of _ general position _ is adapted from @xcite :    definition 1 : _ general position in @xmath73_. @xmath0 is in general position in @xmath73 if no more than @xmath3-points of @xmath0 lie in any @xmath74-dimensional affine subspace . for @xmath3-dimensional data , this means that there are no more than @xmath3 points of @xmath0 on any hyperplane , so that any @xmath75 points of @xmath0 always determine a @xmath3-simplex with non - zero determinant .    throughout",
    ", we will also assume that @xmath76 and that the genuine observations contain no duplicates : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    for any @xmath16-subset @xmath78 and @xmath7 , we will denote the sample mean and covariance of the observations with indexes in @xmath18 as @xmath79 then , given @xmath80 , and an affine equivariant estimator of location @xmath81 , we define the bias of @xmath81 at @xmath0 as @xmath82 furthermore , given @xmath80 , genuine data @xmath0 and an affine equivariant estimator of scatter @xmath83 with @xmath84 positive definite ( denoted from now on by @xmath85 ) , we define the bias of @xmath83 at @xmath0 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) denotes the largest ( smallest ) eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath90 .",

    "to establish the breakdown point of @xmath100 , we first introduce two lemmas describing properties of the @xmath53-index . both deal with the case where @xmath0 lies in general position in @xmath73 .",
    "then , we discuss the case where @xmath0 does not lie in general position .    in the first lemma",
    ", we show that the incongruence index of a clean @xmath16-subset is bounded .",

    "the average of their distances ( as given by equation ) to the hyperplane @xmath25 is finite and constitutes an upper bound on the average distance of any @xmath3 observations of @xmath65 to the hyperplane @xmath25 .",
    "as we have at most @xmath106 different directions @xmath105 and only @xmath107 uncontaminated subsets @xmath104 , the upper bound of the average distances stays finite @xmath108 for any positive , fixed , finite scalar @xmath109 not depending on the outliers .",
    "since the contaminated observations have no influence on the distance @xmath110 with @xmath111 for @xmath105 , we can say that @xmath112    consider now the denominator of @xmath103 . for any @xmath104 and @xmath105 , let @xmath34 denote the subset that consists of the indexes of the @xmath16 observations of the observed data matrix @xmath43 that lie closest to the hyperplane spanned by @xmath25 .",
    "as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath34 contains at least @xmath75 uncontaminated observations . in total , when @xmath104 is not fixed , there are at most @xmath113 different directions @xmath25 defined by a @xmath104 . for any @xmath25 , the smallest value of @xmath114 is attained if the contaminated observations of @xmath34 achieve @xmath115 .",
    "as the uncontaminated observations lie in general position , we know that the @xmath75 uncontaminated observations in @xmath34 can not lie within the same @xmath3-dimensional subspace , i.e. @xmath116 as the number of uncontaminated observations is fixed , we have that @xmath117 for any fixed positive scalar @xmath118 not depending on the outliers .",
    "this inequality holds even if the outliers have the smallest average distance that is possible ( i.e. when @xmath119 for the contaminated observations ) .",
    "thus , inequality ( [ pcs : l1_aux2 ] ) holds for any @xmath47-contaminated data set @xmath7 yielding @xmath120 using equation   and the inequalities   and  , we get  .",

    "in other words , for a given set of indexes @xmath124 , there exists a data set @xmath43 with contaminated observations with indexes in @xmath124 such that @xmath125 is unbounded .",
    "consider first the numerator of @xmath125 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath126 , denote @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath11 , as already mentioned in lemma 1 above , any @xmath16-subset contains at least @xmath75 uncontaminated observations , i.e. @xmath128 . let @xmath129 be the set of all directions defining a hyperplane spanned by a @xmath3-subset of @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath128 yields @xmath131 . as the uncontaminated observations @xmath132 lie in general position , the members of @xmath133 are , by definition , linearly independent . as a result",

    "we are now able to derive the finite sample breakdown point of the pcs of @xmath100 and @xmath139 .    for @xmath14 and @xmath0 in general position ,",

    "we now relax the assumption that the members of @xmath65 lie in general position in @xmath172 and substitute it by the weaker condition that they all lie in general position on a common subspace in @xmath173 for some @xmath174 .",
