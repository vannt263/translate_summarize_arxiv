    "hysteretic response to an oscillating control parameter or `` force '' is a nonlinear nonequilibrium phenomenon commonly observed in both natural and man - made systems .",
    "the example most familiar in physics and electrical engineering is probably the hysteresis loop produced when a ferromagnet at a temperature below its critical temperature @xmath2 is placed in an oscillating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is seen in ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "some other examples are electrochemical adsorbate layers that are driven through a phase transition by an oscillating electrode potential in a cyclic voltammetry experiment @xcite , systems driven through a phase transition between different liquid - crystalline phases by pressure oscillations @xcite , and systems driven through a solid - liquid phase transition by temperature oscillations .",
    "hysteresis is often modeled by systems of differential equations that display discontinuous bifurcations @xcite .",
    "systems that exhibit hysteresis have in common a nonlinear , irreversible response , which causes the phase of the response to lag behind the force . the physical mechanism that causes the hysteretic behavior can",
    ", however , be quite different in different systems and even in different parameter regimes for the same system .",
    "the details of this mechanism must be considered in order to accurately predict such aspects of the hysteretic response as its dependence on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating force . here",
    "we present a study of hysteresis in a particular model system which incorporates both spatial degrees of freedom and thermal fluctuations  a kinetic ising ferromagnet  in a parameter regime where the model has a first - order phase transition in equilibrium and",
    "the system response is _",
    "stochastic_. the model and its behavior in this regime are relevant to at least two different research areas that are rarely discussed together : experimental studies of switching dynamics in nanoscale ferromagnetic and ferroelectric particles and ultrathin films , and theoretical and experimental studies of stochastic resonance in spatially extended systems .",
    "we hope the present study may contribute to some intellectual cross - fertilization .    in recent years",
    "new experimental techniques , such as magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) @xcite , have been developed that permit measurements of the magnetization state and switching behavior of particles as small as a few nanometers .",
    "ferromagnetic particles in this size range consist of a single domain in equilibrium , and together with ultrathin films they are of interest as potential materials for ultra - high density recording media .",
    "the dynamics of magnetization reversal in such systems has been modeled with kinetic ising systems subject to sudden field reversal @xcite .",
    "these numerical and analytical studies have given results in qualitative agreement with the experiments mentioned above .",
    "recent experiments on ultrathin ferromagnetic fe / au ( 001 ) films @xcite have considered the frequency dependence of hysteresis loop areas , which were interpreted in terms of effective exponents consistent with those found for a continuous spin model @xcite .",
    "similar experiments on ultrathin co films on cu(001 ) have found exponents consistent with a mean - field treatment of the ising model @xcite .",
    "these studies of nanoparticles and ultrathin films suggest that experiments can now be performed on systems sufficiently small that atomic - scale simulations become feasible , and that kinetic ising systems are useful models for switching in such nanoscopic systems .    since its introduction as a possible model for the time dependence of the earth s ice ages @xcite",
    ", the concept of stochastic resonance has been applied to a variety of phenomena in physical and biological science and engineering , in which response to a periodic force is enhanced by noise @xcite .",
    "most early treatments considered a single bistable element similar to a mean - field model of a ferromagnet @xcite , with added noise",
    ". however , more recently experimental studies have been conducted with chains of coupled diode resonators @xcite , and numerical and theoretical studies have considered locally coupled one - dimensional time - dependent ginzburg - landau or frenkel - kontorova models @xcite , ising models in one @xcite , two @xcite , and three @xcite dimensions , chains of coupled nonlinear maps @xcite , and systems of globally coupled bistable elements @xcite .    here",
    "we consider hysteresis in a two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 , nearest - neighbor , kinetic ising ferromagnet in an oscillating field with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for convenience , and because of the many experimental measurements of hysteresis that address magnetic systems , we use the customary magnetic language , in which the order parameter is the magnetization per site , @xmath3 $ ] , and the force is the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "however , we expect our results also to apply to stochastic hysteresis phenomena in other areas of science .",
    "for example , in dielectrics @xmath5 and @xmath4 can be re - interpreted as polarization and electric field , in adsorption problems as coverage @xmath6 $ ] and ( electro)chemical potential or ( osmotic)pressure , etc .",
    "below @xmath2 and in zero field this ising model has two degenerate magnetized phases corresponding to a majority of the spins in the positive or the negative direction .",
    "a weak applied field breaks the degeneracy , and the phase with the spins aligned ( anti - aligned ) with the field is stable ( metastable ) . if the field varies periodically in time , the system is driven back and forth across a first - order phase transition , and the two phases alternate between being momentarily stable and metastable . as a result ,",
    "@xmath5 lags behind @xmath4 , and hysteresis occurs . in the regime of small system size , weak applied field , and temperature",
    "well below @xmath2 considered here , the system switches abruptly and stochastically between the two magnetized phases .",
    "a difference between two - dimensional , locally coupled bistable systems , such as this ising model , and the one - dimensional arrays studied in most of the stochastic - resonance studies cited above @xcite , is that locally coupled one - dimensional systems have no ordered phase at nonzero temperature or noise intensity .",
    "the apparent long - range order in those studies is therefore a finite - size effect .",
    "however , the average equilibrium domain size grows exponentially with decreasing temperature @xcite . for chains much shorter than this size ,",

    "two distinct regimes are separated by a crossover field called the dynamic spinodal , @xmath10 .",
    "these two decay regimes can be distinguished by the statistical properties of the lifetime of the metastable phase .",

    "therefore , this field region is termed the `` deterministic regime . '' for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and this field region is therefore termed the `` stochastic regime . ''",
    "both the deterministic and stochastic regimes are further subdivided according to the modes by which the metastable phase decays .",
    "the deterministic regime is split into the multi - droplet ( md ) and strong - field ( sf ) regions for the low and high fields in this regime respectively . for a given system size the stochastic regime",
    "is also divided into the coexistence ( ce ) and single - droplet ( sd ) region for the low and high fields in this regime , respectively .",
    "detailed discussions of these different decay modes are found in refs .",
    "@xcite . at sufficiently low @xmath9 that the single - phase correlation lengths are microscopic , the different decay regimes can be distinguished by the interplay among four length scales : the lattice spacing @xmath19 , the system size @xmath8 , the radius of a critical droplet @xmath20 , and the average distance between supercritical droplets @xmath21 .",
    "the latter two lengths increase with decreasing field strength : @xmath22 and @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the spatial dimensionality . here",
    "we consider specifically decay in the sd region , which is characterized by @xmath25 in this regime , the decay of the metastable phase proceeds by random homogeneous nucleation of a _ single _ critical droplet of the stable phase , which then quickly grows to take over the system .",
    "we have previously proposed @xcite that this decay mechanism may apply to , e.g. , barium ferrite particles in the 5070  nm diameter range @xcite .",

    "theoretical studies of hysteresis have been performed for several models , using a variety of methods .",
    "these include various studies of models with a single degree of freedom , equivalent to mean - field treatments of the ising model @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the spin-1/2 ising model @xcite , and several @xmath30 type models @xcite .",
    "these studies were performed with variations in the details of the simulations and in the model parameters .",
    "most of them indicate that the average hysteresis - loop area , @xmath31=@xmath32 , appears to display power - law dependences on the frequency and amplitude of @xmath4 .",
    "however , there is no universal agreement on the values of the exponents , either experimentally or theoretically . for the ising model , nucleation effects that would lead to a logarithmic frequency dependence",

    "a mean - field model exhibits a dynamic phase transition in which the mean period - averaged magnetization , @xmath33=@xmath34 , changes from @xmath35 to @xmath36=@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "such a dynamic phase transition has been suggested from mc simulations of a kinetic ising model as well @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper differs from most past theoretical and numerical studies of hysteresis in two important ways .",
    "first , mean - field models do not take into account thermal noise and spatial variations in the order parameter , thus ignoring fluctuations which may be important in real materials .",
    "second , most previous investigations of hysteresis in ising models have considered the frequency and amplitude dependence of quantities such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , without considering the manner in which the metastable phase decays .    considering the nucleation - based single - droplet decay mechanism",
    ", we find that the average hysteresis - loop area exhibits an extremely slow crossover to a logarithmic decay with frequency and amplitude in the asymptotic low - frequency limit .",
    "this crossover is sufficiently slow that the behavior can easily be misinterpreted as a power law over several orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "we also show that the average loop area and the residence - time distributions for the system magnetization exhibit evidence of stochastic resonance , and we provide a connection between the characteristic decay time of the residence - time distributions and the power spectral densities of the magnetization time series .",
