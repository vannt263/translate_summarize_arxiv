    "the possibility to govern the electronic transport by applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field has recently attracted considerable interest . in particular , this problem is intensively studied in the hybrid ferromagnet / superconductor structures where the inhomogeneous magnetic field induced by the domain structure in the ferromagnet or a magnetic dot array is used to control the superconducting order parameter structure and the transport of cooper pairs ( see , e.g. , ref .   for review ) .",
    "it is important to note that the typical values of the fields used in such experiments can be relatively small : @xmath9 . nevertheless in the vicinity of the superconducting transition even these field values allow to destroy the cooper pairs and , thus ,",
    "strongly affect the electronic transport .",
    "another possibility to change the conductance applying relatively weak magnetic fields can be realized even in the normal ( i.e. , nonsuperconducting ) structures provided we consider the systems with measurable quantum interference effects , e.g. , disordered two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at low temperatures @xmath10 . in the latter case",
    "the electron conductance is known to be affected by the weak  localization effects , which are caused by the quantum interference between the electronic waves propagating along different time - reversed quasiclassical trajectories @xcite .",
    "the weak - localization correction @xmath11 to the drude conductance @xmath12 in the diffusive limit can be written in the form @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the probability of electron return to the point @xmath15 during the time interval @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the elastic scattering time , @xmath18 is the diffusion constant . in the presence of an external magnetic field the probability of return",
    "is determined by the green function @xmath19 satisfying the so  called cooperon equation : @xmath20 @xmath21c= } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle}= \\delta ( t_{f } -t_{i } ) \\delta ( { \\bf r}_{f } -{\\bf r}_{i } ) \\ , \\ , } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the vector potential , and @xmath23 is the characteristic dephasing time . in the limit of zero magnetic field the expression for the weak - localization correction to the conductance obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) takes the form : @xmath24 the maximal size of closed trajectories contributing to this value is defined by the characteristic dephasing length @xmath25 .",
    "applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of 2deg system one destroys the coherence for closed trajectories which enclose the magnetic flux larger than the flux quantum @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting dephasing time @xmath0 becomes field dependent and can be obtained by comparing the flux through the contour of the size @xmath27 with @xmath28 : @xmath29 . as a consequence ,",
    "the 2deg system has a negative magnetoresistance ( see ref .   and references therein ) and the conductance takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the digamma function . in the low field limit ( @xmath32 ) the expression ( [ magn - cond ] ) transforms into the expansion @xmath33    considering the magnetic fields which are modulated on",
    "microscopic length scales one should modify the above expressions taking into account the changes in the magnetic flux enclosed by the interfering trajectories passing through the regions with a rapidly changing magnetic field .",
    "the hybrid structures containing the 2deg systems and certain sources of the spatially modulated magnetic fields attracted recently both the experimental and theoretical interest @xcite . in part , these investigations have been stimulated by the possible potential of such systems for making detailed studies of the inhomogeneous magnetic field distributions . the magnetic field profiles with microscopic spatial scales can be induced , e.g. , by a vortex lattice in a superconducting film @xcite , as well as by a ferromagnetic film domain structure or a magnetic dot array positioned in the vicinity of the 2deg system .",
    "note also that the problem of the 2deg conductance in a modulated magnetic field appears to be equivalent to the one of a rough 2deg layer placed in a parallel magnetic field @xcite . for the particular case of vortices trapped in a superconducting film",
    "the magnetic field takes the form of flux tubes .",
    "an appropriate theoretical description of the weak  localization phenomenon for different flux tube radii as compared to the @xmath34 length has been developed in ref .  .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the magnetoconductance at low average fields @xmath7 appeared to be proportional to the vortex concentration , i.e. to the @xmath35 value , in contrast to the @xmath36 behavior in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the numerical analysis of the conductance corrections for the case of a lattice of magnetic flux tubes for arbitrary relations between the tube radius and @xmath37 was performed in ref .  .",
    "experimentally these predictions have been confirmed in refs .   for gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "one can expect that the standard expressions ( [ magn - cond ] ) and ( [ expand ] ) for local conductance should hold even for the spatially modulated magnetic fields provided the characteristic spatial scale @xmath1 of such modulation is much larger than the size of the closed trajectories contributing to the conductance corrections .",
    "for a rather strong value of the z - component of the local field @xmath38 the latter size can be defined as a minimum of two lengths : ( i ) the dephasing length in the absence of the field @xmath39 and ( ii ) the length @xmath40 which formally coincides with the textbook definition of the magnetic length . here",
    "we denote the magnetic field component along the direction perpendicular to the plane of a 2deg system as @xmath41 , where @xmath7 is the average field value .",
    "thus , considering rather strong fields and/or not very low temperatures one can use the above expressions for local conductance substituting the function @xmath38 instead of the homogeneous field @xmath7 .",
    "this adiabatic picture obviously breaks down when the closed interfering trajectories pass through the regions with rapidly changing magnetic field which happens either near the zeros of magnetic field or in the limit @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the dephasing length and time in this case are no longer determined by the local field value and their dependence on the field modulation amplitude @xmath2 can become rather unusual . in particular , for the magnetic fields with zero spatial average",
    "the dephasing time is proportional to the square of the field amplitude ( @xmath43 ) which is in sharp contrast to the linear in @xmath7 behavior of the dephasing rate for homogeneous fields .",
    "for some model one  dimensional field profiles such unusual field dependence of the dephasing rate has been previously predicted in ref .  .",
    "experimentally this behavior @xmath43 has been observed in ref .   for random magnetic field profiles .",
    "one of the goals of the present work is to suggest an analytical description of the weak localization phenomenon in inhomogeneous magnetic field for a wide class of the field profiles . in section",
    "ii we consider different regimes of the weak localization which are realized in different regions of magnetic field parameters .",
    "also in this section we demonstrate that in strong magnetic fields and/or at not very low temperatures the local approximation is applicable for calculation of the quantum correction to the conductance . in section iii",
    "we consider the regimes corresponding to the weak amplitude of magnetic field .",
    "in particular , in subsection [ weak_field ] we present the calculations of a natural measurable quantity , i.e. , the conductance averaged over the system area . as a next step , we proceed with the description of the dephasing rate behavior vs characteristics of the modulated magnetic field for a wide class of the periodic field profiles ( see section [ def_time ] ) . in section",
    "iv we consider the case of strong magnetic fields and show that the dependence of the magnetoresistance vs the average field value appears to reveal an unusual peak structure .",
    "an obvious reason for the non  monotonous behavior of the resistance vs the average field is associated with partial field compensation effect which occurs in the regions where the @xmath44-components of the average and local fields have the opposite signs .",
    "thus , applying the external magnetic field to the system placed in a modulated field with zero average one can stimulate the interference effects in some regions of the sample . depending on the particular shape of the field profile",
    "this effect can result in the negative or positive magnetoresistance of the sample . in other words , the 2deg samples coupled with the subsystems inducing the inhomogeneous magnetic field",
    "can reveal a so  called `` anti  localization '' ( see , e.g. , refs .  )",
    "phenomenon when we apply an external magnetic field @xmath7 .",
    "the results and suggestions for possible experiments are summarized in section v.    hereafter we focus on the case of classically weak magnetic fields ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "indeed the diffusive approximation for the electron motion is applicable when @xmath46 . at such fields the cyclotron frequency @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "thus , these magnetic fields affect only the interference corrections to the transport characteristics , and we disregard the inhomogeneous field effect on the drude  type contribution to the conductance which has been previously studied in refs . on the basis of the semiclassical approach .",
    "note that all results obtained in this paper are valid not only for ideal 2deg with zero thickness but also for quasi - two - dimensional electron systems with finite thickness @xmath49 , which has to satisfy the condition @xmath50 . in this case",
    "one can define the field range , in which longitudinal components do not affect the weak - localization correction to the conductance , while the transverse component does .",
    "indeed , the effect of a weak longitudinal component of magnetic field @xmath51 can be described by the renormalization of the characteristic dephasing time : the value @xmath52 has to be replaced by @xmath53 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , where @xmath54 thus , the influence of the longitudinal component becomes noticeable only for @xmath55 .",
    "this value is much larger than the characteristic value @xmath56 of transverse component , which can strongly affect the weak - localization correction .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath57 and neglect the effect of longitudinal magnetic field components .",
    "is large enough so that the dephasing is controlled by the local magnetic field . in the white square the magnetic field is weak but its inhomogeneity reveals in the renormalization of the effective electron dephasing time . in the shaded region",
    "the dephasing occurs at the dephasing length @xmath58 and the influence of magnetic filed reveals in a small additional correction to the conductivity.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in this section we outline the approximate approaches which are used for describing dephasing regimes in different regions of the system s parameters .    in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field the weak - localization correction to the conductance of 2deg is determined by the interplay of three lengthscales : ( i ) dephasing length @xmath37 , which at low temperatures grows as @xmath59 ( see ref .  ) , ( ii ) the scale of the magnetic field inhomogeneity @xmath1 , and ( iii ) the magnetic length @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the amplitude of the periodic magnetic field .",
    "the ratios of these lengths define the behaviour of the weak - localization correction to the conductance . for the analysis of the behavior of quantum correction to the conductance it is convenient to use the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath62 to describe the temperature dependence of weak - localization correction to the conductance and the parameter @xmath63 to consider the influence of modulated magnetic field .",
    "note that for a two - dimensional lattice with translational vectors @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 are unit vectors and @xmath67 , @xmath68 are integers ) the value @xmath1 is the absolute value of the smallest vector @xmath69 ( @xmath70 $ ] ) .    depending on the ratio @xmath71 there exist two qualitatively different mechanisms of the electron dephasing caused by the inhomogeneous field .",
    "provided @xmath72 and simultaneously the @xmath1 length scale is smaller than @xmath58 ( white square in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ) the dephasing scenario in a modulated field with zero average can be explained by the following qualitative arguments .",
    "let us consider a certain quasiclassical trajectory of the length @xmath73 which encloses many primitive cells of the periodic field profile .",
    "the magnetic flux coming from the cells which are positioned inside the contour appears to be averaged to zero .",
    "the only residual flux is associated with the cells which are crossed by the quasiclassical trajectory and give a flux contribution which strongly fluctuates with the increase in the area enclosed by the trajectory .",
    "the characteristic amplitude of these flux fluctuations can be estimated as the number of the elementary cells crossed by the trajectory ( @xmath74 ) multiplied by the typical flux value @xmath5 : @xmath75 . comparing this fluctuating flux with the flux quantum @xmath28 we find the length of the dephasing @xmath76 and corresponding dephasing rate @xmath77 .",
    "these qualitative arguments are in beautiful agreement with the quantitative consideration in section [ def_time ] carried out on the basis of the `` nearly free electron '' approximation . in the opposite limit @xmath78 the dephasing is controlled by the local magnetic field value .    of course , the magnetic field provides a dominating dephasing mechanism only at low temperatures . for rather high temperatures when @xmath79 $ ] ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ) the dephasing occurs at the length @xmath58 and one can analyze the magnetic field effect on the weak - localization correction to the conductance perturbatively ( see section [ weak_field ] ) .",
    "the gray region in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) corresponds to another important regime : the weak - localization correction to the conductance in this case can be obtained within the local approximation .",

    "transforms into a new effective operator , which can be reduced to the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",

    "( [ eq_15 ] ) we obtain    @xmath243    where the value @xmath244 is defined by the expression ( [ eq_20 ] ) . expanding the expression ( [ renorm_cond ] ) in the limit @xmath245",
    ", we obtain    @xmath246    the expressions ( [ renorm_cond ] ) and ( [ eq_newdeltag ] ) formally coincide with the ones for the homogeneous field , but in a modulated magnetic field the dephasing time @xmath244 is determined by the amplitude of modulation .",
    "we now proceed with the consideration of the strong field limit and focus on the possibility to change the sign of magnetoresistance of 2deg in the presence of a modulated magnetic field .",
    "specifically , we consider a ferromagnetic film/2deg system placed in the external magnetic field perpendicular to the 2deg plane .",
    "let the ferromagnetic film have a periodic stripe domain structure .",
    "we will assume that the film of 2deg is thin enough to consider only the _ z _ component @xmath247 of magnetic field depending only on @xmath151 coordinate along the sample surface .",
    "we will denote the external field as @xmath7 and the absolute value of the periodic field of stripe structure by @xmath248 .",
    "further the description of the weak - localization correction to the conductance will be developed on the basis of local approximation .",
    "this approximation is correct when the electron dephasing length is less than the characteristic scale of inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "these conditions mean that @xmath249 ( the gray region in fig .  [ fig_diagram ] ) .",
    "note that the effect of positive magnetoresistance can be observed only in the region of parameters where the local approximation is applicable .",
    "indeed , the eqs . ( [ eq_comb ] ) and ( [ eq_newdeltag ] ) show that in the opposite limit the second derivative @xmath250 at @xmath191 is positive and , as a result , the magnetoresistance is negative .",
    "the effect of positive magnetoresistance strongly depends on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "we assume for simplicity the thickness of ferromagnetic layer to exceed strongly the period of stripe structure @xmath1 . in this case for hybrid structures f/2deg the spatial configuration of magnetic field in the region of 2deg depends mostly on the thickness of the spacer between 2deg and ferromagnetic film . if the spacer is much thinner than the period of stripe structure",
    "@xmath1 then the distribution of the @xmath44-component @xmath251 of the magnetic field in 2deg approximately has the form of meander . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the spacer thickness is much larger than the spatial period of the domain structure , the magnetic field profile is smeared . on a qualitative level",
    "one can describe this limit considering a sinusoidal field profile .",
    "the periodic magnetic field in the form of meander is the simplest configuration of magnetic field which reveals the effect of positive magnetoresistance .",
    "the external homogeneous magnetic field applied to the system leads to the suppression of weak localization in the regions where the sign of the external field coincides with the one of the periodic field component .",
    "in opposite , the external field results in the increase of the interference corrections in the domains where the sign of these field components are different .",
    "the competition between these two effects defines the resulting dependence of the averaged conductance vs an external homogeneous field . if the increase in the weak - localization correction dominates then the resulting dependence of averaged conductance vs external homogeneous magnetic field is decreasing . in this case",
    "one can conclude that 2deg has positive magnetoresistance .",
    "let us search for the region of parameters , where the effect of positive magnetoresistance can be observed . within the local approximation",
    "the averaged conductance is defined by the following expression : @xmath252 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 is the drude conductance .",
    "introducing dimensionless variables we obtain : @xmath256 where @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 . expanding the expression ( [ eq_22 ] ) into the taylor s series for @xmath260 we find",
    "@xmath261 one can see that the positive magnetoresistance is realized for @xmath262 , which satisfies the condition    @xmath263    this condition is realized when the amplitude of periodic magnetic field is larger than some critical value @xmath264 , which depends on the parameter @xmath265 . the dependence @xmath266 for the meander configuration of periodic magnetic field is shown in fig .  [ fig_6](a ) .",
    "for @xmath267 the boundary of the positive magnetoresistance region is defined by the condition @xmath268 .",
    "these conclusions are based on the equation ( [ eq_3 ] ) and , thus , are valid only in the diffusive limit .",
    "the domain of applicability of the diffusive approximation is defined by the condition @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is an elastic scattering length . in the limit @xmath271 ( where @xmath272 is the fermi wave - length ) the weak - localization is fully suppressed and the conductance approaches the drude value .",
    "the dependencies of the averaged conductance of 2deg vs the external homogeneous field at different amplitudes of periodic field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_7](a ) for @xmath273 .",
    "one can see that for @xmath274 these dependencies have the sharp dips with minima at @xmath275 .      as a second example we consider the effect of positive magnetoresistance in the sinusoidal profile of the @xmath44-component of the magnetic field @xmath276 the expression for the averaged conductance does not depend on the period of magnetic field @xmath1 and has the following form :    @xmath277    here @xmath278 .",

    "[ fig_7](b ) . from the comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig_7](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig_7](b ) one can see that in periodic magnetic field with sinusoidal profile the effect of positive magnetoresistance is weaker than in the case of meander profile .",
    "this is caused by the fact that for the sinusoidal profile the regions where the external and periodic fields have opposite directions shrink with the external field increasing .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_7](b ) the amplitude of the periodic magnetic field is shown by the vertical dotted line .",
    "one can see that for @xmath281 the behavior of @xmath282 changes qualitatively . even for high amplitude of the periodic magnetic field @xmath280 in the region @xmath283",
    "the conductance deviates from the drude value .",
    "this is caused by the incomplete destruction of the interference near the field zero points even at rather high @xmath262 values .",
    "the expression ( [ eq_24 ] ) allows to find the condition of positive magnetoresistance in combined cosinusoidal and homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetoresistance peak appears provided @xmath284 which gives us the condition @xmath285 here the function @xmath286 is defined by the expression ( [ eq_21 ] ) .",
    "the condition ( [ eq_coscond ] ) is satisfied when the periodic magnetic field amplitude @xmath262 is larger than the critical value @xmath287 . the dependence @xmath287 for sinusoidal profile of periodic magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_6](b ) .",
    "one can observe a clear difference between two model profiles : contrary to the meander case the critical field diverges at large @xmath265 values .",
    "to sum up , we have investigated the influence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the weak localization phenomenon in 2deg systems . in the low field limit",
    "we have carried out a perturbative analysis of the conductance behavior at high temperatures and developed an analytical procedure to find a renormalization of the dephasing rate at low temperatures . in the high field limit",
    "we have justified the validity of the local approximation and have used this approach to calculate the averaged conductance for particular model field profiles .",
    "it is found that the systems with modulated magnetic field profiles provide a possibility to observe the effect of positive magnetoresistance .",
    "we have showed that the positive magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic film/2deg systems can be observed experimentally provided the amplitude of the field modulation exceeds a certain critical value depending on the system parameters .",
    "finally , we consider some estimates for existing experimental systems . we take here the 2deg system in the gaas / algaas heterostructure with high electron mobility as a typical example ( see ref .  ) .",
    "this system is characterized by the following typical parameters : @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "the typical amplitude of the magnetic field induced by the ferromagnetic film with a domain structure is of the order of @xmath290 ( see ref .  ) . for the meander distribution of the magnetic field with such amplitude the height of the magnetoresistance peak can reach one half of the weak - localization correction in zero field .",
