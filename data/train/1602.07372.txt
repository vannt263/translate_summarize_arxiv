    "understanding the mechanisms for mass accretion and ejection is one of the key issues in star formation theories .",

    "the optically visible nature of these objects has allowed astronomers to extensively observe them at optical and and near - infrared wavelengths over the years .",
    "the current paradigm of mass accretion based on these observations has been summarized by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the stellar magnetospheres of accreting t tauri stars ( classical t tauri stars , hereafter cttss ) are associated with the inner edges of the circumsteller disks , and they regulate the stellar rotation . mass accretion from the disk to the star occurs through this magnetic field . these accretion flows , called magnetospheric accretion flows , are associated with optical and near - infared permitted line emission , in particular with the broad component ( a full width half maximum velocity @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "accretion shocks at the stellar photosphere cause hot spots , with a typical temperature of @xmath3 k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the measurement of temperatures ) , and these add blue excess continuum to the photospheric emission ( @xmath4 k )",
    ". the blue excess continuum does not show photospheric absorption , and as a result , it makes a number of photospheric absorption lines shallower ( `` veiling '' ) .",

    "emission lines show variabilities on different time scales .",
    "a periodic variability of 220 days is in most cases well explained by a combination of stellar rotation and the non - axisymmetric distribution of hot spots and magnetospheric accretion columns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , while time - variable mass accretion in close binaries explains such a variability in dq tau @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the following mechanisms seem to cause irregular variabilities over wide ranges of time scales : ( 1 ) time - variable mass accretion ; ( 2 ) magnetic flaring activities ; and ( 3 ) obscuration by circumstellar dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extensive studies of variabilities could lead us to better understand the physics and geometry of stellar magnetospheres and magnetospheric mass accretion . the stability of magnetic structures at the star and the inner disk region may also affect the architecture of planetary systems such as the orbits of hot jupiters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    as for other young stellar objects , many cttss are also associated with a collimated jet , which is often observed in optical and near - ir forbidden line emission .",
    "it is believed that these jets are powered by mass accretion .",

    "the optical colors did not change during this period , consistent with the explanation that the flux decreases are due to gray extinction .",
    "these authors point out the possibility that the gray extinction is due to occultation of the star by a tidally disrupted dusty disk or a wind with large dust grains .",

    "two 360-s exposures with similar signal - to - noise were obtained for a few nights ( see table [ table : log ] ) with an interval of 6 - 13 min .",
    "these two spectra were nearly identical to each other , and we averaged the spectra for each night for better signal - to - noise .    while spectrophotometry was successful in 2010b @xcite ,",
    "it was not successful for some observing runs , probably due to the presence of cirrus or patchy clouds during the observations . therefore , our measurements and discussion will be focused on data without absolute fluxes , including emission and absorption features normalized to the continuum , equivalent widths , and the color of the continuum .",
    "the instrument aperture ( 16 in diameter ) was centered on rw aur a , to avoid flux from rw aur b ( 14 from the star ) .",

    "the occultation scenario without scattering requires a sharp edge of the occulter , comparable to the stellar radii .",

    "one might think that the observed trends could be explained if rw aur a is an unresolved binary .",
    "the observed fluxes toward rw aur a flux would be dominated by the bright component in the bright period , but would be obscured during the faint periods , and as a result , the observed fluxes during these period would be dominated by the companion .    however , the facts below rather favour the scenario where the observed spectra are associated with the same star during the entire period .",

    "these simulations show that unstable and stable mass accretion occur at high and low mass accretion rates , if the star has a dipole field misaligned relative to the rotation axis by a small angle ( @xmath32 ) . in the unstable regime ,",
    "the star accretes through several transient elongated inflows developed by the rt instability .",
    "these inflows ( `` tongues '' ) deposit gas at random places on the stellar surface .",
    "their gas kinematics changes even within a few rotational periods of the star .",
    "in contrast , the star accretes in ordered funnel streams in the stable regime .",
    "@xcite carried out radiative transfer simulations for the unstable and stable regimes of magnetospheric accretion , and found complicated time variation of the balmer lines profiles similar to those seen in the lines in figures [ fig : profiles1 ] and [ fig : profiles2 ] . in contrast",
    ", the h@xmath7 profiles observed for rw aur a do not show such a complicated variation .",
    "this may be due to a different origin for the emission line , e.g. , from a wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary ,",
    "the rt models by @xcite explain the bright and faint periods of rw aur as follows .",
    "the bright periods would be due to high mass accretion rates , which cause a relatively bright blue excess continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the high accretion rates would also cause unstable magnetospheric accretion flows , which cause a complicated time variation in the line profiles and a large variation of redshifted absorption in and lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the faint periods are due to low mass accretion rates , for which we expect lower optical continuum flux and more stable accretion flow .",
    "@xcite also showed the presence of a relatively large and periodic redshifted absorption in balmer line profiles in the stable periods .",
    "in contrast , the observed variation of redshifted absorption in and lines are significantly smaller in the faint stable periods than the bright unstable period .",
    "such a discrepancy may be attributed to either ( 1 ) different mass accretion rates ; ( 2 ) different excitation conditions ; ( 3 ) a combination of the inflow geometry and a viewing angle ; or ( 4 ) a more azimuthally uniform inflow .",
    "observations of the spectra with full stellar rotational periods will allow us to further to test the validity of the rt models .",
    "however , it is not clear if the time variable mass accretion can explain the following trends and features in the faint periods : ( 1 ) the absence of photospheric absorption ; ( 2 ) redshifted absorption in the line ; and ( 3 ) hot thermal dust emission .",
    "many young stellar objects including cttss are known to host a collimated jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "understanding their driving mechanism and their physical link with protostellar evolution are also important issues in star formation theories .",
    "cttss have offered the best opportunity to observationally investigate this link because of their optically visible nature .",
    "their line luminosities and the veiling toward cttss strongly support the theories which predict that the jets are powered by disk accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the proposed theories of jet driving fall into the following two categories .",
    "the x - wind @xcite and magnetospheric ejection theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that the jet launches from the stellar magnetosphere , or the inner edge of the disk associated with the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "in contrast , the disk wind theories predict that the jet launching region covers a wider disk surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "however , observational studies of the jet launching have been hampered by the following issues .",
    "the angular resolutions of most present telescopes are far from sufficient for resolving the jet launching or flow accelerating regions , which are predicted to be within a few au from the star .",
    "such observations require an angular resolution of several milliarcseonds for a typical distance to nearby star forming regions ( @xmath13140 pc ) .",
    "such resolutions could be achieved by some optical or near - infrared interferometers , but their spatial information is still limited .",
    "alternatively , simultaneous monitoring of jet structures and signatures of magnetospheric accretion would allow us to test theories of jet driving and mass accretion @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the proper motions of the rw aur jets for which the ejection has occurred during the past @xmath1370 years .",
    "these suggest time variable mass ejection with at least two modes : one irregular and asymmetric ( possibly random ) on timescales of @xmath33310 yr , and another more regular with a @xmath1320 year period .",
    "variabilities shown in recent photometry @xcite and our high resolution spectroscopy show a similar time scale ( @xmath134 yr between the faint periods in 2010 and 2014 ) .",
    "monitoring observations of the jet structures together with optical spectra in our study may be useful for understanding whether the jets are launched near the stellar magnetosphere , and how the time variation of mass accretion affects the mass ejection seen in the jets .",
    "if we find a clear correlation between these , it would also imply that the time variations of the optical spectra discussed in this work are due to changes in mass accretion activity .",
    "we present monitoring observations of the active t tauri star rw aur using optical high - resolution spectroscopy with cfht - espadons .",
    "the observations were made from 2010 october to 2015 january in the autumn - winter semesters ( august  january ) , with 24 observing runs for each semester , and 17 visits during each run , with intervals of 110 nights , with a spectral resolution of @xmath34=68,000 .",
    "optical photometry in the literature shows bright , stable fluxes over most of this period , with lower fluxes ( by 2 - 3 mag . ) in 2010 and 2014 .    in the bright period ( semesters 2011b2013b , august 2011 to january 2014 )",
    "our spectra show clear photospheric absorption , whose degree of variation ( @xmath11=0.75 at 6000  ) and color ( @xmath35 ) agrees with standard veiling theory . in contrast ,",
    "photospheric absorption is absent or marginal in 2010b ( october  november 2010 ) and 2014b ( august 2014 to january 2015 ) , which correspond to the faint periods .",
    "different trends of time variation are also observed in 8542  , 7772 and 8446  , and 5876   profiles between the bright and faint periods . in the bright period",
    "the profiles show complicated variation , and redshifted absorption in the and lines show a large variation .",
    "in contrast , the line profiles are similar to each other during the faint periods .",
    "we have discussed the following possibilities to attempt to explain the variations in the optical spectra and optical , near - ir and x - ray fluxes : ( 1 ) occultation without a binary companion ; ( 2 ) occultation in an unresolved binary ; and ( 3 ) changes in mass accretion .",
    "none of the scenarios can simply explain all the observed trends .",
    "more theoretical work would be able to justify either of scenario ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) .",
    "alternatively , simultaneous observations of the jet structures would allow us to investigate if the observed time variation is due to mass accretion .",
