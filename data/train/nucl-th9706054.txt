    "nuclear compton scattering below pion threshold is sensitive to low - energy nucleon parameters ( e.g. electromagnetic polarizabilities ) as well as nucleon correlations inside the nucleus . at present no quantitative consistent description for all parts of the nuclear compton amplitude below pion threshold exists .",
    "therefore , phenomenological models have been developed for the different contributions and in the last few years several important pieces of information have been extracted from the experimental data . at low energies",
    "the relative strengths of electromagnetic multipoles were analyzed @xcite for comparison with predictions from multipole sum rules . the interesting question ,",
    "whether the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon inside the nucleus essentially differ from those of the free nucleon , has been theoretically addressed @xcite and experimentally studied with reasonable accuracy @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to write the total nuclear compton amplitude @xmath2 as a sum of three contributions provided by different physical mechanisms ( see also @xcite ) : the collective nuclear excitations ( giant resonances ) , @xmath3 , the scattering by quasi - deuteron clusters , @xmath4 , and the so - called seagull amplitude , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the photon energy and @xmath7 is the scattering angle . the physical background of this separation is the following : via the optical theorem and a subtracted dispersion relation the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is determined up to an additive constant by the total photoabsorption cross section .",
    "this cross section contains resonant structures , which at different energies correspond to different excitation mechanisms . at low energies",
    "( up to 30 mev ) absorption is dominated by giant resonances , which can be classified due to their electromagnetic multipolarity . at higher energies , but still below pion threshold the photon is mainly absorbed by two - nucleon clusters , which is known as the quasi - deuteron mechanism .    the seagull amplitude @xmath8 , which has no imaginary part below pion threshold , contains contributions from two fundamentally different physical sources , the scattering on individual nucleons inside the nucleus ( @xmath9 ) and the scattering on correlated nucleon pairs ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "such correlations occur as a result of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which can be well described in terms of meson exchange between the nucleons .",
    "meson exchange leads to specific observable phenomena in compton scattering .",
    "best known is the modification of the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule @xcite , i.e. the appearance of the so - called enhancement constant @xmath0 .",
    "also , meson exchange currents can imitate a modification of the nucleon polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "this contribution , coming from the polarizabilities of a correlated nucleon pair , has to be subtracted in order to single out a change of the bound nucleon s polarizabilities from its free values .",
    "the effect of meson exchange currents on the different electromagnetic properties of nuclei is thoroughly discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of model calculations has been carried out for the enhancement constant @xmath0 as well as for the different contributions to @xmath0 , , which are theoretically or experimentally accessible @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "parts of @xmath0 could be related to parameters of fermi liquid theory and to the notion of quasi - particle masses @xcite .",
    "a compilation of results can be found in @xcite .",
    "the contributions to @xmath0 have also been studied in a diagrammatic form @xcite , similar to the approach considered here .    at low energies",
    "the dependence of the amplitude @xmath11 on momentum transfer @xmath12 is determined by the distribution of nucleon pairs inside the nucleus . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the momenta of the incoming and outgoing photons , respectively . in the case of heavy nuclei",
    "the scale of nucleon correlations is essentially smaller than the nuclear radius @xmath15 .",
    "thus , one can expect that the @xmath16-dependence of @xmath11 is similar to the nuclear charge form factor @xmath17 .",
    "however , experimental data clearly indicate @xcite that this @xmath16-dependence can not fully be identified with the form factor @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to use for the amplitude @xmath11 another form factor @xmath19 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "it has been proposed to apply @xmath20=@xmath21 , which corresponds to the distribution of uncorrelated nucleon pairs @xcite . a first attempt to quantitatively discuss the function @xmath19 within a model calculation has been made in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the amplitude @xmath11 was considered within a modified fermi gas model , in which the deviation of the nucleon wave functions from plane waves was taken into account in a perturbative way .",
    "it was shown that @xmath11 is given by the convolution of a two - body spin - isospin correlation function with matrix elements corresponding to the amputated irreducible feynman diagrams for meson exchange .",
    "if the nuclear radius tends to infinity the correlation function becomes proportional to the form factor @xmath18 .    among the current experimental data for various nuclei contradictions at large angles",
    "occur @xcite .",
    "as any modification of the energy - dependent part of the mesonic seagull amplitude essentially modifies the angular dependence , a reliable calculation of @xmath11 may help to clarify this situation .",
    "therefore , a thorough discussion of the effect of finite nuclear size , as well as of a realistic nuclear density is highly due . the present article is devoted to this problem .",
    "experimentally , the total photoabsorption cross section @xmath22 below pion threshold can be seperated into a giant resonance ( @xmath23 ) part and a quasi - deuteron ( @xmath24 ) part : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the pion mass .",
    "this serves as a means of identifying the resonance parts of the scattering amplitude @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 the same is valid for @xmath28 .",
    "the seagull amplitude @xmath8 has an imaginary part only above pion threshold .",
    "in addition to the fulfillment of a dispersion relation , the main constraint on the nuclear compton amplitude is the low - energy theorem .",
    "it states that the compton scattering amplitude at @xmath31 is equal to the ( coherent ) thomson limit @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the polarisation vectors of the incoming and outgoing photons , respectively , @xmath35 is the nucleon mass and @xmath36 is the proton charge , @xmath37 .",
    "the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the nuclear mass number and proton number , respectively .",
    "we define the giant resonance part @xmath40 of the enhancement constant @xmath0 via the following relation @xmath41 then , taking into account the fact that @xmath42 , one obtains the low - energy limit of the giant resonance part of the compton amplitude from the dispersion relation ( [ mesongr1 ] ) : @xmath43 similarly , we write @xmath44 for the quasi - deuteron amplitude , which leads to the relation @xmath45 from ( [ thomson ] ) , together with ( [ resonance ] ) and ( [ mesonqd2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath46 for the low - energy limit of the seagull amplitude , where @xmath47 . the first term in brackets in eq .",

    "note that our notations for the seagull amplitude differ slightly from @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 in eq .",

    "let us briefly discuss the effect of retardation .",
    "in an expansion @xcite of the plane wave for the incoming photon into terms with definite total angular momentum @xmath51 and parity @xmath52 , @xmath53   ,           \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each term will contain all powers in @xmath54 starting from @xmath55 . in eq .",

    "when in eq .",
    "( [ planewave ] ) the substitution @xmath58 is made , the resulting cross section is called `` unretarded '' . if the wavelength of the incoming photon is of the same order as the nuclear radius , it is impossible to expand the photon plane wave with respect to @xmath59 in the matrix elements for photoabsorption . at these photon energies",
    "the effect of retardation is essential .",
    "all absorption cross sections , which in principle can be obtained directly from experiment , are by definition retarded quantities . at high energies",
    "the cross sections calculated with the use of an unretarded photon wave function differ essentially from retarded cross sections and can not be extracted directly from experimental data",
    ". nevertheless , unretarded cross sections are convenient objects in theoretical investigations .",
    "if the potential @xmath60 entering into the hamiltonian contains velocity - dependent or charge exchange contributions , it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that this leads to a modified trk sum rule ( [ modtrk ] ) with @xmath48 given by @xmath61\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle     .",
    "\\label{kappaunret}\\ ] ] in ( [ kappaunret ] ) @xmath62 is the @xmath63-component of the intrinsic electric dipole operator .",
    "again , since the unretarded @xmath64 and @xmath48 are by themselves not observable , it is necessary to establish a connection with experimentally observed quantities .",
    "this has been attempted by gerasimov @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath64 consists of two parts , a giant resonance part @xmath65 and a quasi - deuteron part @xmath66 .",
    "for the giant resonance region gerasimov s argument states that in the sum rule ( [ mesongr3 ] ) the contribution of higher multipoles precisely cancels the retardation correction to @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 is equal to the contribution of the giant dipole resonance to @xmath48 .",
    "a discussion of the applicability of gerasimov s argument at giant resonance energies can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us now return to the properties of the seagull amplitude .",
    "in addition to the static limit ( [ mesons2 ] ) , it is necessary to take into account the corrections proportional to @xmath54 . usually the seagull amplitude is represented in the following form ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath68\\;{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon $ } } _ 1\\cdot           { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon $ } } _ 2 +          \\label{fullseagull } \\\\          & & a\\left",

    "it was shown that in the limit @xmath74 , where again @xmath26 denotes the pion mass , one has @xmath19=@xmath18 .",
    "also it was shown that the approximation ( [ fullseagull ] ) , where only terms up to @xmath75 were taken into account , reproduces with good accuracy the energy dependence up to 100 mev . for a finite @xmath76",
