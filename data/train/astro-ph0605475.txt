    "stars form out of dense cores of molecular gas , but the details of this process are far from understood . to probe this process , continuum and line data of star - forming regions can be combined to provide a coherent , self - consistent picture of young stellar objects and their associated , gaseous environments , i.e. , densities , temperatures , and velocities .",
    "indeed , these physical properties are intertwined within dynamical and luminosity evolution during star formation .",
    "observations over a wide range of continuum wavelengths can test models of dynamical and luminosity evolution because different parts of a star - forming region are traced by different wavelengths .",
    "for example , cold envelopes are traced by ( sub)millimeter dust emission which yield information on total ( gas+dust ) masses . on the other hand , inner envelopes or disks",
    "are traced by infrared emission , which is directly related to internal luminosity sources .",
    "in addition , observations of a wide variety of lines yield information about associated gas motions and can probe the excitation conditions along various lines of sight in star - forming regions .",
    "chemistry is also important to understand , however .",
    "for example , velocity structures derived from molecular spectra can be misinterpreted if incongruous abundance profiles are adopted .",
    "several studies have shown that chemical evolution is not independent of dynamical and luminosity evolution ( rawlings & yates 2001 ; doty et al . 2002 ; lee , bergin & evans 2004 ) .",
    "most star formation in the galaxy occurs in clusters embedded within giant molecular clouds ( lada & lada 2003 ) , but the high surface densities of young stellar objects make it difficult to disentangle the star formation process .",
    "although not considered  typical \" star formation , more isolated cases have been examined vigorously since they are much less complicated and observations of them are easier to interpret ( di francesco et al .",
    "2006 ) . between these extremes",
    "lie the smaller _ groups _ of young stellar objects ( i.e. , @xmath2 @xmath3 10 ) , which may have condensed out of a single dense core ( machida et al .",
    "examining such groups in detail may provide access to understanding features of the clustered star formation process , yet are relatively uncomplicated and hence easier to understand .",
    "indeed , our galactic neighborhood is resplendent in examples of groups of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , whose associated continuum and line emission can be examined to probe how they formed .    in this paper , we examine continuum emission associated with l1251b , where spitzer space telescope ( sst ) observations reveal a small group . the line emission associated with l1251b is presented in a separate paper ( lee et al . in preparation ; hereafter paper ii ) .",

    "1994 ) .",
    "earlier observations have shown that star formation is proceeding in l1251b , but details have been difficult to discern , due to low sensitivity and resolution .",
    "the @xmath7band image of l1251b by hodapp ( 1994 ) shows a bipolar nebula with nearby infrared sources , giving a clue that a small group may be forming .",
    "myers & mardones ( 1998 ) also found five iso sources within l1251b , further suggesting the possibility of grouped star formation .",
    "we have gathered new observations of l1251b at high sensitivity or resolution , to probe in detail the formation and interaction processes in this small group . to determine which sources are ysos within l1251b , we include new continuum data from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths . in this study , we use coordinates in the j2000 epoch , so the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) coordinates of iras 22376 + 7455 are ( 22@xmath1038@xmath1147.16@xmath12 , + 751128.71 ) .",

    "the opening of the bipolar nebula is similar in direction to that of the jet seen ( with the white line ) in figure 2 , suggesting that iras 22376 + 7455 may not be the only driver of the large co outflow , as previously believed .",

    "the stronger peak may be a high column density peak of the envelope .",
    "the weaker peak , however , may be heated primarily by irs1 since it disappears at longer wavelengths .",
    "if the intensity distributions of dust continuum at various wavelengths are compared , a shift is seen in the positions of intensity peaks with wavelength from north to south .",
    "the pointing error of the 350 @xmath22 emission is relatively large , so it could be adjusted in position to match its weaker peak to the 450 @xmath22 second peak .",

    "the angular separation ( @xmath28 ) between the 1.3 mm intensity peak and the stronger 450 @xmath22 peak is much greater than the pointing error ( @xmath29 ) of the 450 @xmath22 and 1.3 mm observations .",
    "such a shift may involve a systematic variation of physical conditions such as density , temperature , or opacity .",
    "figure 7a shows the dust continuum intensities observed with the ovro array at 3 mm and 1.3 mm .",

    "four detections are seen .",
    "the brighter two detections are compact and coincident with irs1 and irs2 as seen in the ovro 3 mm data , so deeply embedded disk components of irs1 and irs2 are traced with these interferometric observations .",
    "the fainter two detections are more extended and peak to the east and southeast of irs1 , and they were detected separately in the usb and lsb data sets which were reduced independently .",
    "the faint extended emission associated with these two latter sources is coincident with the brightest regions of integrated n@xmath30h@xmath31 1@xmath60 intensity seen in our ovro map ( see paper ii ) .",
    "no 1.3 mm continuum emission is seen associated with any other near - infrared sources .",
    "the two weaker intensity peaks at 1.3 mm are also consistent with the stronger peaks of the 350 and 450  emission and the peaks of 830 and 1300  emission observed with single dishes",
    ". therefore , the two intensity peaks newly detected in the sma 1.3 mm observation are probably the highest densities of the l1251b envelope , whose extended emission was resolved out by the interferometers .",
    "if true , these sources may be prestellar condensations and not detected at 3 mm with ovro due to low sensitivity .",
    "interestingly , however , the two weaker sma 1.3 mm emission peaks were not detected in the ovro 1.3 mm observation .",
    "the two sma 1.3 mm peaks lie within the fwhm of the ovro primary beam , and the 1 @xmath18 sensitivities of both ovro and sma 1.3 mm observations are the same although the peak intensity of irs1 in the ovro 1.3 mm observation ( 14 mjy beam@xmath32 ) is less than a half of that in the sma 1.3 mm observation ( 34 mjy beam@xmath32 ) .",
    "we tested the sma data by excluding spatial frequencies lower than the lowest spatial frequency of the ovro data , and found that extended 1.3 mm emission between irs1 and irs2 disappeared in the resulting images .",
    "this discrepancy is therefore caused mainly by shorter baselines in the sma data ensemble , which is more sensitive to extended structure .",
    "remaining discrepancies are likely the result of the flux calibration not being as accurate as for the sma data since flux calibrators were monitored at 1 mm less frequently at ovro . as a result ,",
    "the flux of irs1 from the sma observation is stronger than that from the ovro observation . other complementary data , such as continuum data at 345 ghz ( observed with the sma ) , are necessary to understand the physical conditions of two extended prestellar condensations .",

    "( note that the yso candidate under the dashed lines in the extragalactic region in one color - magnitude diagram must be located above the dashed line in the other color - magnitude diagram . )",
    "21 objects are identified as ysos based on these two color - magnitude diagrams . as in figure 10 , sources identified with plus symbols in figure 11 are those around the l1251b core . after removing the likely extragalactic sources in figure 10 ,",
    "the number of class 0/i candidates is reduced to 4 and all of them are located around the l1251b core .",
    "also , the number of class ii candidates reduces to 14 in the l1251e region and to 5 around the l1251b core .",
    "three of the ysos identified by the color - magnitude diagrams ( figure 11 ) do not fall into the criteria of class 0/i or class ii in the color - color diagram ( figure 10 ) and located far from l1251b .",
    "figure 12 shows the spatial distribution of yso candidates in l1251e , and the fluxes of these yso candidates are listed in table 2 and 3 .",
    "the flux uncertainty is @xmath1615% .    in summary",
    ", we are adopting the color criteria as given in the c2d catalog and their source classification .",
    "first , the c2d color - magnitude diagrams ( figure 11 ) , which do not provide the information on classes , are used to extract yso candidates , and as a next step to classify the evolutionary stages of the yso candidates , the color - color diagram seen in figure 10 is used . finally , 4 class 0/i and 14 class",
    "ii candidates are classified in l1251e even though 21 yso candidates are extracted from the c2d color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "the galaxy contamination rate of our yso candidate selection criteria obtained from the swire data is 15 sources per square degree , thus the 0.4@xmath140.35  spitzer image of l1251e should have 2.1 mis - identified yso candidates .",
    "therefore , excluding 3 yso candidates ( including one known hh object ) is consistent with the prediction of our adopted criteria .    among the sources around the l1251b core ,",
    "figures 10 and 11 indicate that irs1 , irs2 , and source 16 are in class 0/i , irs3 , irs5 , irs6 , and sources 8 and 9 are in class ii , and sources 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , and 14 are stars .",
    "we note that source 11 is detected only in the irac 3.6 @xmath13 m and 4.5 @xmath13 m bands . in figure 10 ,",
    "some sources with [ 5.8]@xmath6[8.0 ] @xmath33 1.5 have [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] @xmath3 1 ; from the c2d criteria , all of these , except for one source ( see below ) , are likely background galaxies .",
    "we note that irs1 has a much redder [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] color than a [ 5.8]@xmath6[8.0 ] color , perhaps caused by absorption within its massive envelope by the 10 @xmath13 m silicate feature that overlaps with the irac 8.0 @xmath13 m band ( allen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "similar colors are seen in other deeply embedded sources ( jorgensen et al .",
    "2006 ; dunham et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "color - color identification of evolutionary state is based on presumptions about the physical characteristics of each object , and this could lead to some misclassifications .",
    "for example , the exceptional source ( noted above ) in figure 10 with [ 5.8]@xmath6[8.0 ] @xmath33 1.5 and [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5 ] @xmath3 1 may be a class 0/i yso with an very low envelope density ( see fig . 1 of allen et al .",
    "in addition , the yso candidate with [ 3.6]@xmath6[4.5]@xmath3511 and [ 5.8]@xmath6[8.0]@xmath35@xmath60.1 also might be a class 0/i object with a very low central luminosity , a low envelope density , and a large centrifugal radius .",
    "finally , the yso candidate with colors similar to those of class iii objects or stars ( i.e. , class iii / star ) may be a class ii source with a low disk accretion rate and a low inclination .",
    "we expect the number of misclassifications to be minimal , though calibration of color - color diagrams through modeling the seds of specific sources therein would be welcome .",
    "figure 13 is a @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 $ ] color - magnitude diagram which is used to check the possibility of confusion between our sources and background galaxies .",
    "all yso candidates detected clearly at 24  are bright or red enough to be separated clearly from background galaxies .",
    "irs1 , irs2 , irs4 , and source 16 , which are in class 0/i and were detected separately by mips are very red .",
    "irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 are clearly the youngest most embedded members of l1251b , and they are possibly still forming out of the rapidly rotating envelope and through interaction with outflows ( see paper ii ) .",
    "irs3 , irs5 , and irs6 , however , were not clearly detected at 24  even though they are classified as class ii and are close in projection to irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 .",
    "these may comprise an older population located at the outer boundary of the dense l1251b region .",
    "figure 14 shows stellar model fits on top of seds of sources around l1251b .",
    "according to the c2d stellar model fits , sources 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 are possible foreground or background stars reddened by some extinction . based on the description of the source type by catalogs ( evans et al .",
    "2006 ; lai et al . in preparation ) , irs1 , irs2 , irs4 , and source 16 are potential class 0/i objects and irs3 , irs5 , irs6 , and sources 8 and 9 are possibly class ii , star / disk objects",
    ". these results are consistent with results from the color - color diagram shown in figure 10 .",
    "the mips 70  image for l1251e is shown in figure 15a .",
    "some of the yso candidates show diffuse or point source - like emission at 70 , though the emission from the inner l1251b region is confused by irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 . to estimate the 70 @xmath13 m fluxes of these unresolved sources",
    ", 70 @xmath13 m fluxes were measured within a 24 @xmath13 m intensity contour chosen to separate the three sources ( see figure 15b ) .",
    "given the ratios of flux between sources enclosed by this contour , the total 70 @xmath13 m flux , as measured by annular photometry , was divided among the three sources .",
    "( in applying this procedure , we have assumed that the spatial extent of the 70 @xmath13 m sources matches that of the 24 @xmath13 m resolved sources . )",
    "note that the extent of emission from irs1 will influence the flux measurements of irs2 and irs4 . to mitigate the influence of the extended emission from irs1 ,",
    "therefore , the irs1 flux has been fitted with a gaussian profile , and the relative fluxes from irs2 and irs4 above the wings of the irs1 profile have been measured .",
    "we also applied the 70 @xmath22 flux ratios to estimate the 350 , 450 , and 850 @xmath22 fluxes of the three sources . in table 4 , we list flux densities from 1.2 to 850  of irs1 , irs2 and irs4 and in table 5 , we list bolometric luminosities ( @xmath38 ) , bolometric temperatures ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the luminosity at @xmath42 , for these sources based on their seds . according to the results , irs1 is the dominant luminosity source in l1251b by a factor of @xmath1610 .",
    "young et al . ( 2003 ) found that l1251b should be in class 0 based on @xmath39 ( 64 k ) and @xmath40 ( 0.01 ) , which were calculated from single dish submillimeter continuum observations , and assuming only one heating source ( iras 22376 + 7455 ) .",
    "however , as seen in table 5 , irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 are classified to class i objects based on @xmath39 ( @xmath43 k ) while they are still categorized to class 0 based on @xmath40 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of irs1 and irs2 include submillimeter emission from their respective envelopes , but these may also include such emission from the prestellar objects between irs1 and irs2 .",
    "( such prestellar objects do not have emission at shorter wavelengths to contribute to bolometric luminosities . )",
    "given the proximity of these objects to irs1 , their possible contributions likely affect the bolometric luminosity estimate of irs1 more than any other in l1251b source .",
    "hence , the luminosity of irs1 of 10  is likely an upper limit .",
    "in contrast , if fluxes at submillimeter wavelengths ( @xmath45 ) are not considered , the lower limit of the luminosity of irs1 is 5 . to quantify the amount of contribution of fluxes at submillimeter wavelengths from each source , detail models are necessary .",
    "in l1251e , about 30 point sources were detected in the mips 24  band , and @xmath1675% of these were classified as yso candidates ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "based on color - color classifications ( see figure 10 ) , about 22% and 78% of the ysos in l1251e are in class 0/i and class ii respectively .",
    "( a few yso candidates , however , have colors that do not fall into the class 0/i or class ii classifications . ) within l1251b , however , 6 ysos were detected half of them are classified as class 0/i candidates , and the other half are classified as class ii protostars .",
    "the whole field size of the mips observation is about 2.5 pc@xmath46 , so the number density of ysos in l1251e is about 10 pc@xmath47 .",
    "the spatial number density of ysos in l1251b exceeds that in the whole l1251e region by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the area used for the number density calculation in l1251b is @xmath160.01 pc@xmath48 , which covers emission at submillimeter wavelengths shown in figure 6 .",
    "we compare l1251e and l1251b with two larger cluster forming regions observed with the sst : ngc 2264 ( teixeira et al .",
    "2006 ) and perseus ( jorgensen et al .",
    "2006 ) . for this , we concentrate on the  spokes \" cluster in ngc 2264 and ngc 1333 and ic 348 in perseus .",
    "the spokes cluster ( @xmath162 pc@xmath48 ) and ngc 1333 ( @xmath163.2 pc@xmath48 ) have similar spatial areas to l1251e ( @xmath162.5 pc@xmath48 ) , and ic 348 has about three times bigger area ( @xmath166.9 pc@xmath48 ) than l1251e .",
    "forty ysos were detected in the spokes cluster , which is the densest part of ngc 2264 , in the mips 24  band .",
    "the area of the spokes cluster is @xmath162 pc@xmath48 , yielding a yso number density of @xmath1620 pc@xmath47 , greater than that of l1251e by a factor of 2 . in ngc 2264 , however , the magnitude of the weakest yso detected at 24  is about 6.7 mag . with a similar restriction ( and keeping in mind the factor of @xmath162 in distance between regions ) ,",
    "the number of point sources detected in the mips 24 micron band with [ 24 ] @xmath3 6.7 in l1251e is 10 , and all are classified as yso candidates ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "based on this number , the spatial number density of yso candidates in l1251e is @xmath164 pc@xmath47 , i.e. , smaller than that in the spokes cluster by a factor of 5 . despite this difference in spatial number densities , the fraction of class 0/i candidates in l1251e ( @xmath1622% ) is not very different .",
    "in addition , the fraction of class 0/i candidates in l1251b ( 50% ) , the densest region in l1251e , is not different from that of the dense region around iras 12 in ngc 2264 ( @xmath1660% ) .",
    "ic 348 and ngc 1333 show similar number densities of ysos to that in l1251e .",
    "the fractions of class 0/i candidates in ic 348 and ngc 1333 are about 14% and 36% , respectively . in the remaining cloud outside ic 348 and ngc 1333",
    ", however , the fraction is about 47% , indicative of different formation timescales over perseus . in summary",
    ", therefore , the number density of ysos in l1251e is similar to those in active star forming regions of ngc 2264 and perseus .",
    "l1251b has three class 0/i members ( irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 ) , which have been detected at 24 , and three more class ii members ( irs3 , irs5 , and irs6 ) are located in projection inside l1251b in the irac images ( e.g. , see figures 3 or 4 ) .",
    "the average projected distance among 18 ysos in l1251e is about 213with the standard deviation of @xmath16148 whereas the average projected distance of 6 ysos in l1251b is about 24 indicating clustering .",
    "single dish submillimeter continuum emission , which traces dense envelope material , covers the 6 ysos of l1251b with intensity peaks between irs1 and irs2 .",
    "in addition , two sources located between irs1 and irs2 have been newly detected at 1.3 mm with the sma .",
    "they are not associated to any irac or mips source ; and are possibly prestellar condensations .",
    "the shift of intensity peaks in the submillimeter continuum emission ( see figure 6 and  3 ) observed with single dish telescopes seems related to the variation of physical properties of the two prestellar condensations .",
    "for example , the shift of intensity peaks from the north to the south with wavelength can be explained if the prestellar source at the north has a higher temperature than the other one .",
    "these observed features covering various evolutionary stages ( from prestellar to class ii ) suggest that fragmentations during gravitational collapse of a dense molecular core ( boss 1997 ; machida et al .",
    "2005 ) can explain the formation of this small group of pre- and protostellar objects in l1251b .",
    "class 0/i objects in l1251b might help the formation of further prestellar condensations since the external pressure resulting from a previous star formation event could reduce jeans fragmentation length scales in the remaining matter for the next incidence of star formation ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "2006 and references ) .",
    "we examine the molecular line data in paper ii to understand how dynamics and chemistry are distributed in l1251b , and how the group members of l1251b are interacting .",
    "many yso candidates in various evolutionary stages are distributed all over the extended l1251e region .",
    "in addition , the east core has a radius of about 0.3 pc and may harbor future star formation ( see paper ii ) .",
    "this suggests that l1251e is a possible example of low - mass cluster formation , and l1251b , which is a small group of pre- and protostellar objects , is just part of the larger , on - going cluster formation .",
    "l1251e , the densest c@xmath5o core of l1251 , has been observed by the sst as part of the sst c2d legacy project .",
    "the most interesting region in l1251e is l1251b , which has been revealed by the sst to be a small group of protostars .",
    "we have compared the sst data with other continuum data to study l1251b more comprehensively .",
    "the summary of our results is as follows :    \\1 .",
    "l1251e contains at least two cores , a western one coincident with l1251b and an eastern one detected at 850  continuum .",
    "no source has been detected in the irac or mips bands toward the east core , suggesting it is starless .",
    "asymmetrically blue line profiles ( see paper ii ) have been detected toward the eastern core , however , that are suggestive of infall motions .",
    "l1251e has a surface number density of young stellar objects of @xmath1610 pc@xmath47 , not very different from those seen in the spokes cluster of ngc 2264 and the most active star forming regions of perseus , ic 348 and ngc 1333 .",
    "the spatial number density in l1251b is , however , larger than that of l1251e by about two orders of magnitude , indicative of highly concentrated star formation .",
    "the fractions of class 0/i candidates in al1251e and l1251b are similar to those in and around the spokes cluster , but the fraction in perseus varies from region to region .    \\4 .",
    "six sources located in projection within l1251b were detected in all irac bands but only irs1 , irs2 and irs4 are detected clearly at 24   ( with mips ) and classified as class 0/i candidates .",
    "irs2 is associated with a near - infrared bipolar nebula .",
    "dust continuum emission maps made at 350  and 450  show two intensity peaks in l1251b .",
    "the stronger peak is not associated with any irac source but the weaker peak is associated with irs1 , the brightest object in l1251b .",
    "the stronger peak is located between irs1 and irs2 .",
    "the weaker peak disappears at 850  and 1300  and the distribution of continuum emission around the stronger peak becomes more spherical ( and shifts to the south with increasing wavelength . ) therefore , the stronger peak seems to be a column density peak , and the weaker peak is possibly from dust heated by irs1 .",
    "irs1 and irs2 are detected as compact objects in the ovro 3 mm and the sma 1.3 mm observations , indicating that they are deeply embedded disk sources .",
    "in addition , two sources have been newly detected between irs1 and irs2 at 1.3 mm with the sma .",
    "these two sources confirm that the stronger intensity peaks at 350 and 450  and intensity peaks at 850 and 1300  are column density peaks .",
    "the positional shift of continuum density peaks with wavelength is possibly caused by a temperature difference between the two newly detected sources .",

    "<S> a near - infrared bipolar nebula , which is not associated with the brightest object and is located at the southeast corner of l1251b , has been detected in the irac bands . </S>",
    "<S> ovro and sma interferometric observations indicate that the brightest source and the bipolar nebula source in the irac bands are deeply embedded disk sources . </S>",
    "<S> submillimeter continuum observations with single - dish telescopes and the sma interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objects with very high column densities . outside of the small group , many young stellar object candidates have been detected over a larger region of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> extended emission to the east of l1251b has been detected at 850 ; this  east core \" may be a site for future star formation since no point source has been detected with irac or mips . </S>",
