    "there are two primary sources for the x - ray luminosity of early - type galaxies , emission from stellar sources and optically thin radiation from a hot dilute interstellar medium ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 ) . for the more luminous x - ray emitting ellipticals",
    ", there is little doubt that emission from hot interstellar gas is the dominant mechanism . to explain the behavior of the x - ray emission from hot gas , cooling flow models were developed , and had a number of successes . in the standard model , gas that is shed by stars is converted into hot gas with a temperature corresponding to the velocity dispersion of the stars .",
    "radiative losses of the gas cause it to fall inward into the galaxy , releasing additional gravitational energy .",
    "this model is able to account for the observed magnitude of the x - ray luminosity , it can reproduce the x - ray surface brightness distribution , and it predicts a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . however , there are a few important discrepancies between theory and observation . the predicted slope of @xmath1@xmath2 relationship ( approximately @xmath3 , where @xmath41.8 ) is not as steep as the observational relationship obtained using _",
    "einstein observatory _ data , where @xmath52.4 .",
    "more recent work by brown & bregman ( 1998 ) and irwin & sarazin ( 1998 ) find the slope to be about 2.7 , from _ rosat _ data , in clear disagreement with the steady - state cooling flow model .",
    "another important discrepancy is the extremely large dispersion about the relationship , about two orders of magnitude in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath2 , first discovered in _",
    "einstein observatory _ data ( canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) and confirmed with the _ rosat _ sample ( white & davis 1997 ; brown & bregman 1998 ) .",
    "there have been a few explanations for the cause of the large dispersion in @xmath1 , which is either attributed to the internal properties of the galaxy or to the external influences of the environment .",
    "dercole et al .",
    "( 1989 ) suggested that slight differences in the structure of a galaxy could lead to widely variant x - ray luminosities at fixed optical luminosity .",
    "however , this result occurs for a particular form of the supernova rate as a function of cosmic time , which may not be likely ( loewenstein & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "other models that include the effects of supernova heating and galactic winds do not predict a large dispersion in @xmath1 at the current epoch ( david , forman , & jones 1991 ; loewenstein & mathews 1987 ; vedder , trester , & canizares 1988 ) .",
    "environmental effects are becoming more widely understood to have a significant , if not central influence on the x - ray properties of a galaxy .",
    "one effect is stripping of gas from a galaxy as it passes through the ambient cluster medium ( takeda , nulsen , & fabian 1984 ; gaetz , salpeter , & shaviv 1987 ) .",
    "this is likely to be important in the richer clusters , but most current samples do not contain very rich clusters ( the virgo cluster being the richest ) . although there is evidence for stripping for ngc 4406 in virgo , early - type galaxies in virgo are not x - ray underluminous in general , so stripping is probably the exception rather than the rule .",
    "another environmental effect is accretion of material onto galaxies , which can raise the x - ray luminosity substantially ( brighenti & mathews 1998 ) and probably is most important in gas - rich group and cluster environments .",
    "a third environmental effect is the ability of an ambient medium to stifle a galactic wind , causing those galaxies to retain their gas and become more x - ray luminous than field galaxies ( brown & bregman 1998 ) .    in brown & bregman ( 1998 ) , we presented the x - ray luminosities of a complete optically - selected sample of 34 early - type galaxies in the 0.52.0 kev _ rosat _ band .",
    "we noticed that the galaxies with the largest values of @xmath1 ( for a given @xmath2 ) were in the more populated regions ( the virgo or fornax clusters , or in the centers of groups ) of the sample , suggesting that being in moderately rich environments enhances the x - ray emission of a system .",
    "this trend may differ from that reported by white & sarazin ( 1991 ) , who found that lower - x - ray luminous galaxies had 50% more bright neighboring galaxies than higher - x - ray luminous galaxies . to further assess the importance of environment upon x - ray luminosities",
    ", we advance our previous work by analyzing the x - ray properties of our sample in the context of a quantitative measure of the galactic richness provided by tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "in addition , we present information on data processing , sample bias , temperature distribution , and several other issues not discussed in our previous letter .",
    "the criteria for including a galaxy in this work is established in brown & bregman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the targets ( see table [ tab : opt ] ) are detected at the @xmath6 97% confidence level , and include twelve galaxies lying within the poor clusters of fornax and virgo , with the remainder either isolated or lying in loose groups .",
    "for the purpose of this survey , we used pspc data in the processing rather than hri data when available , since hri data contains no spectral information ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .    lcrrrcrrrr    name & type & _ l _ & _ b _ & @xmath7 & log @xmath8 & d & @xmath9 & log@xmath2 & @xmath10 + & & & ( mag ) & ( km / s ) & ( km / s ) & ( @xmath11 ) & ( ergs / s ) & mpc@xmath12 +    n 0720 & e & 173.02 & -70.36 & 11.16 & 2.392 & 2050 @xmath13 & 38.58 & 43.65 @xmath14 & 0.25 +",

    "this is the only object that we have where that is true .",
    "instead , we chose a circle of radius 240@xmath53 as the source , and similar sized circles on either side as the background . as a comparison , we calculated the flux using an annular background 46.3 @xmath9 from the center of the source which resulted in only a 10% difference , smaller than the uncertainty due to photon statistics .",
    "spatial analysis was performed on the data in order to compare our well defined choice of background with backgrounds taken at large radii .",
    "we first determined the total photon count ( proportional to the flux ) in a @xmath54 circle using the 46.3 @xmath9 background ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "this flux was then compared to one obtained by subtracting a background region beyond the extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "this background region was also taken to be an annulus , and was typically located at @xmath55 from the galaxy center .",
    "the comparisons show that only for 36% of the galaxies is there a difference greater than 10% between taking a background as detailed above , and a more traditional background ( neglecting the five weak detections and ngc 4494 ) .",
    "we find that differences greater than 10% only exist for four of the galaxies ( ngc 1395 , ngc 1399 , ngc 4406 , and ngc 4472 ) when photon count errors are taken into account , and 68% of the galaxies show differences of less than 5% ( figure [ fig : backg ] ) .",
    "we used a raymond - smith plasma model for spectral fits , succinctly discussed in brown & bregman ( 1998 ) .",

    "single - temperature models were preferred over two - temperature models when acceptable @xmath56 values could be obtained ( @xmath57 for 30 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "for ngc 4472 , an acceptable fit could not be obtained with either a single - temperature or two - temperature model with 50% abundances , so a single - temperature model with 0.8 solar abundance was used . for ngc 1399 and ngc 1404 , we also allowed the galactic @xmath58 column density to be a free parameter within a limited range ( 20.1 @xmath59 log @xmath60 20.5 and 20.1 @xmath59 log @xmath60 20.3 , respectively in @xmath61 ) to obtain an acceptable fit .",

    ", a fit must be performed to the data to obtain a flux using pros software .",
    "therefore , the data for these few galaxies were rebinned into single bins , and fitted for the normalization only . we assumed a fixed @xmath41 = 3/2@xmath63 ( typical of the findings of davis & white 1996 ) except for ngc 5102 and ngc 4494 where we used temperatures of 0.5 kev and 0.3 kev respectively , since the lower calculated temperatures led to clearly unacceptable fits . the stellar velocity dispersion temperature , @xmath63 ,",
    "is calculated according to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath8 is the one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion .    after fitting the data ,",
    "fluxes were obtained for two energy ranges @xmath66 0.52.0 kev and 0.12.0 kev @xmath66 using the intrinsic spectrum found for each source , and fitted temperatures when available .",
    "luminosities were then calculated using distances derived from faber et al .",

    "this is the  classical \" malmquist bias , and is corrected for in the distance measurements used in our analyses ( faber et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "the other type of malmquist bias occurs in magnitude - limited samples and reflects the fact that the intrinsic luminosity function is not being equally or completely sampled at all distances .",
    "for the most distant galaxies , only the high luminosity part of the luminosity function is sampled , whereas for the nearest galaxies , much more of the luminosity function is sampled .",
    "although this is an important issue for some investigations , such as those using standard candles as distance indicators ( e.g. , teerikorpi 1997 ) , it is not important for this study , which does not require that the schecter luminosity function be fully sampled .",
    "our sample merely requires that the galaxies be representative of those that comprise the schecter luminosity function , and that they were chosen in a fashion that does not bias the x - ray luminosity .",
    "these galaxies where chosen independently of their x - ray properties , each was detected in x - rays , and they lie far above the magnitude limit of the faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) sample , so this should comprise an unbiased sample .",
    "one of results of our work is the demonstration that environment has a central influence on the x - ray luminosity as seen in the positive correlation of the @xmath113 ratio with galaxy density . in the lowest density environments ,",
    "only x - ray faint galaxies are found ( low @xmath113 ratios ) , and the galaxies with the highest @xmath113 ratios are found in fairly dense environments .",
    "however , galaxies in dense environments exhibit a wide range in @xmath113 , suggesting that environment does not have the same effect on all galaxies , and we suggest a natural explanation for this .",
    "the distribution of @xmath113 in figure [ fig : dens ] reveals that there is a positive correlation between local environmental richness and x - ray brightness , but with significant dispersion at moderate and high galaxy density . in an effort to understand this distribution , it is important to recognize that environment can have both positive and negative effects on the x - ray brightness of a galaxy ( e.g. , takeda , nulsen , & fabian 1984 ) . groups and clusters with a significant ambient medium can lead to stripping of the interstellar gas from a galaxy , leading to a substantial reduction in @xmath113 .",
    "however , for galaxies moving slowly through relatively cool clusters or groups , the galaxy may be able to accrete this external material , increasing @xmath113 ( brighenti & mathews 1998 ) .",
    "also , an ambient group or cluster medium could stifle galactic winds , should they exist , causing the galaxy to retain its hot gas locally , which also will increase @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , galaxies in clusters or groups would have a range of @xmath113 , where the low values are determined by galaxies where stripping or winds occur , and the high values represent systems that are accreting the ambient material or having their winds stifled . in very rich clusters , like coma , stripping is probably the dominant process , but none of the galaxies in our sample lie in such a rich system .",
    "the richest cluster in this sample is virgo , where stripping is expected to occur in some of the galaxies , but not most of them ( gaetz , salpeter , & shaviv 1987 ) .    the role of environment has been previously examined by white & sarazin ( 1991 ) using _ einstein observatory _ data to determine if a correlation exists between local galaxy density and @xmath1 .",
    "white & sarazin ( 1991 ) find the number of bright , neighboring galaxies within various projected distances from each x - ray galaxy , and perform linear regressions of log @xmath1 against log @xmath2 and the local density of galaxies .",
    "they conclude that the large dispersion in @xmath1 is not significantly reduced by taking into account the individual local galaxy density , which may be due to uncertainties in the numbers of neighbors found .",
    "white & sarazin ( 1991 ) then binned the x - ray sample in order to reduce statistical error .",
    "the x - ray sample is divided into four subsets : high-@xmath1 ( log @xmath177 ) detections , high-@xmath1 upper limits , low-@xmath1 detections , and low-@xmath1 upper limits .",
    "the total number of bright galaxies ( again , within various projected distances ) around all galaxies in each subset is calculated yielding an averaged number of bright galaxies per x - ray galaxy for each subgroup .",
    "they find that low-@xmath1 galaxies have @xmath178% more neighbors than high-@xmath1 galaxies , which the authors argue is expected if ram - pressure stripping is a major factor in the @xmath1 dispersion .",
    "the method of white & sarazin ( 1991 ) is significantly different from ours .",
    "whereas they bin an incomplete sample of _ einstein observatory _ data and look at bright neighbors in various projected distances , we use the tabulated local galaxy density data of tully ( 1988 ) for each galaxy in our complete sample . the tully local density is calculated using a three - dimensional grid spaced at 0.5 mpc .",
    "also , our data includes x - ray fainter galaxies , which allows us to extend the range of x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratios .",
    "our data extends down to log @xmath173 versus the canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri ( 1987 ; used by white & sarazin 1991 ) data which extends down to log @xmath179 .",
    "since none of the galaxies in these samples lie in rich environments ( i.e. , @xmath174 4 galaxies per mpc@xmath180 ) , we can not determine if ram - pressure stripping effects becomes significant in the observed x - ray luminosity in very dense environments .",
    "the extremely low values of @xmath113 seen in isolated galaxies is probably the strongest evidence in favor of galactic winds .",
    "the x - ray emission from these systems is so low that one is probably detecting the x - ray contribution from stars rather than gas , indicating that these galaxies are not gas - rich . for these galaxies , an ambient group or cluster medium",
    "is not detected and they do not lie in a high velocity dispersion group , so stripping is unlikely to occur .",
    "furthermore , the rate of supernova energy input is probably adequate to drive a galactic wind , as discussed below .",
    "therefore , the most viable mechanism for rendering the galaxies x - ray weak is through galactic winds ( see pellegrini & ciotti 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "galactic winds will occur if the supernova heating rate is sufficient to raise the temperature of the mass loss from stars above the escape temperature ( from the galaxy center ) .",
    "a steady - state galactic wind will obey bernoulli s law , which for a flow that has a small flow velocity when it reaches large radius is @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the gravitational potential and @xmath183 is the enthalpy . for a steady - state wind from the center of a galaxy",
    "where @xmath184 , @xmath185 the variable @xmath65 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath186 is the proton mass , and @xmath187 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we use the supernova rate of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and energy per supernova of @xmath110 ergs , and the stellar mass loss rate of faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) to determine gas temperature entering the system : @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the mass loss rates from stars and supernovae ( see , e.g. , mathews & brighenti 1997 ) .",
    "we then find that the most optically luminous galaxy that can sustain a total wind occurs at @xmath191 .",
    "less luminous galaxies can drive a wind , provided that high ambient pressure from the surrounding environment does not prevent it . for galaxies more luminous than about @xmath192 ,",
    "the radius beyond which a wind can exist is far enough out that most of the stellar mass loss is retained by the galaxy ( for galaxies with more complex models , partial winds may be more common ; see pelligrini & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty in estimating these values for @xmath2 is the energy released per supernova , which may be uncertain by about a factor of two .",
    "previously , we offered the suggestion that the galaxies with high @xmath113 values were x - ray bright because galactic winds were stifled ( contained ) by a high - pressure ambient medium .",
    "this is energetically possible if the supernova rate is correctly given by van den bergh & tammann ( 1991 ) , whose rate differs by about a factor of three from cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see figure [ fig : lxlb ] ) .",
    "the primary discrepancy between the two rate calculations is the correction for the inability to detect supernovae against the ambient light of the galaxy .",
    "a correction by a factor of three was suggested by van den bergh & tammann ( 1991 ) , while cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that the correction factor is only about 40% .",
    "we calculated the distance from the center of an elliptical galaxy within which a point source near the magnitude limit of these surveys would fall below the @xmath193 detection threshold , for a typical elliptical galaxy in these surveys .",
    "we find that only 5 - 30% of the supernovae would have been missed due to this effect , similar to the more accurate calculation of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the supernova heating rate of turatto , capellaro , & benetti ( 1994 ; line @xmath109 in figure [ fig : lxlb ] ) is insufficient to account for the x - ray emission from the highest @xmath113 systems , which are up to a factor of three above this line ( an energy of @xmath110 erg per supernova is used ) . unless the energy per supernova has been underestimated by a factor of three , we consider unlikely our original suggestion that stifled winds can explain the highest @xmath113 systems .",
    "the source of energy in these high luminosity systems is most likely gravitational , supplied by accretion onto the system , as discussed by mathews & brighenti ( 1998 ) and brighenti & mathews ( 1999 ) .",
    "they show that the temperature and density distributions of hot gas in x - ray luminous galaxies , such as ngc 4472 , are consistent with their calculations .",
    "previously , there was hope that the cooling flow model could provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed log@xmath1log@xmath2 distribution .",
    "an @xmath1@xmath2 correlation with a slope of about 1.7 was predicted , which was similar to observations , and the dispersion about this correlation was treated as perturbations due ( in part ) to differences in galaxy evolution .",
    "the picture that we present is fundamentally different .",
    "we suggest that the steep observed correlation is due to the transition from galaxies with total winds , to those with partial winds , to those where the gas is retained and can accrete additional material .",
    "as calculated above , we expect this transition from winds to retained gas to occur in the range @xmath194 .",
    "below log@xmath195 , one only finds galaxies with small values of @xmath113 , as would be expected for systems with total winds .",
    "also , all galaxies with log@xmath196 have @xmath113 values well above that for purely stellar emission , consistent with retaining their gas . of equal importance",
    "is the influence of environment , which can remove galactic gas through stripping , but can also help galaxies retain their gas by stifling winds , and can add to the galactic gas content through accretion .",
    "a critical difference between our picture and most others is that heating by supernovae can be comparable to , if not greater than the heating by the thermalization of stellar ejecta .",
    "this suggestion is not in complete agreement with other models or with some observations , the disagreement centering around the importance of winds and the metal enrichment introduced by the supernovae .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( 1999 ) study massive galaxies and use a supernova rate that is less than half the value determined by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with these supernova rates and galactic potential wells ,",
    "winds are not important .",
    "they show that a range of nearly an order of magnitude in @xmath113 can be introduced by truncation of the galaxy as it interacts with neighbors ( brighenti & mathews 1999 ) .    however , the observed range in @xmath113 is two orders of magnitude , and when the stellar contribution is removed , the range in @xmath113 due to the gas alone substantially exceeds two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is unlikely that truncation alone will produce the wide range in @xmath113 .",
    "also , in their model , one might expect that truncation would be least important in regions of low galaxy density , leading to high values of @xmath113 in such regions . in conflict with this expectation",
    ", we find that galaxies in the lowest density environments only have low values of @xmath113 .",
    "the great range of @xmath113 and the finding that fairly isolated galaxies have low values of @xmath113 is consistent with expectations of a model that incorporates galactic winds .",
    "a discussion of supernova rates also introduces an apparent conflict between the expected and observed metallicity of the x - ray emitting gas ( see brown & bregman 1998 ) . for the standard cooling flow picture and the rates given by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the metallicity should be several times solar instead of near - solar ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ; buote 1999 ) .",
    "however , the metallicities are measured only for the most luminous galaxies , and these are precisely the ones for which accretion of circumgalactic gas dominates the gas content .",
    "the metallicity prediction must be revised downward due to the diluting effects of the accreted gas , which may reduce the metallicity into the observed range .",
    "the various suggestions made by us and others has several immediate predictions that will be tested by upcoming observations .",
    "first , the amount of the stellar contribution to the x - ray emission should be spatially resolved by _",
    "chandra _ , leading to a clear determination of this value , and probably a determination of the spectrum , separated from the spectrum of the hot gas .",
    "another important test will be the measurement of the rate of cooling gas , since it should be low if supernovae cause galactic winds and approximately the stellar mass loss rate if cooling flows are uniformly present .",
    "we predict that the low @xmath113 galaxies will show little evidence of cooling gas , which will be measured through the o viii and o vii x - ray lines with _",
    "chandra _ , and through the o vi line with _",
    "the high @xmath113 galaxies should have cooling rates similar to the stellar mass loss rate , if not greater , although most models agree on this prediction .",
    "cooling flow models should show a significant metallicity gradient from the outer to the inner parts , reflecting the stellar metallicity gradient , and this effect should be even more pronounced for galaxies that are accreting material from the surrounding group or cluster .",
    "finally , the ongoing optical supernova searches , being carried out with modern ccd techniques , should yield an improved determination of the supernova rate .",
