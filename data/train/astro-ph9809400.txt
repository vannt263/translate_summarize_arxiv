    "there are several distinct classes of galaxies with smooth surface brightness profiles and absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath5 .",
    "brighter than @xmath6 , most dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies have central nuclei which are unresolved from the ground at the distance of the virgo cluster . however , there are quite a few des in this luminosity range that have no sign of a nucleus . within the virgo and fornax clusters , the non - nucleated des form an extended population , with a spatial distribution similar to the spirals and irregulars rather than the bright ellipticals and the rest of the des ( ferguson & sandage 1989 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the difference is that the non - nucleated des are stripped or harassed dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies ( e.g. lin & faber 1983 ; moore _ et al .",
    "the most popular alternative scenario for de formation ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ) is that they formed in one monolithic collapse , and subsequently ejected their ism via supernova winds . to distinguish these scenarios we require an observational probe of the earliest and most important episodes of star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems may provide such a probe .    the specific globular cluster frequency ( @xmath0",
    ", the number of clusters normalized to a galaxy with @xmath7 ) is correlated with hubble type such that it increases from late type spirals to early type spirals and ellipticals , suggesting a correlation with the size of the bulge component ( harris 1991a ) .",
    "the empirical variation of @xmath0  from early to late types suggests a simple test for whether des are more closely related to giant ellipticals ( es ) or to irregulars ( harris 1991b ) .",
    "if part of the e family , they should have @xmath8 ; if part of the late - type disk galaxy family , we expect @xmath4 . finally , one might expect that nucleated des will have higher values of @xmath0 than non - nucleated des .",
    "we have begun a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "snapshot survey in order to study the properties of the gcs and nuclei of de galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present results on @xmath0  for 24 galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters and the leo group .",
    "table  1 gives the galaxy names morphological types from photographic catalogs .",
    "this sample represents all the data suitable for determining @xmath0 taken during _",
    "cycle  6 .",
    "we assume distance moduli of 31.2 for the virgo cluster , 31.4 for the fornax cluster , and 30.3 for the leo group . when presenting an uncertainty of an average quantity we quote the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "the observations and analysis are summarized in section  2 .",
    "we present the results on the specific frequencies in section  3 and discuss some implications in section  4 .",
    "the data will be more fully presented in miller _",
    "( 1998 , paper  ii ) .",
    "wfpc2 snapshot images are taken in the f555w ( @xmath9 sec ) and f814w ( 300 sec ) bandpasses with the galaxies centered in chip wf3 .",
    "the procedures for object detection and classification , aperture photometry , and photometric calibration are similar to those used by miller _",
    "( 1997 ) . from these data",
    "we can determine the ( ) colors of gc candidates down to a completeness limit of @xmath10 .",
    "the specific globular cluster frequency , @xmath0 , is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number of clusters ( harris & van den bergh 1981 ) .",
    "cluster candidates are selected based on color ( @xmath13 ) , size ( fwhm @xmath14 2.5 pixels ) , and accuracy of photometry ( err ( ) @xmath14 0.3  mag ) .",
    "the net number of cluster candidates for a galaxy , @xmath12 , is the total number of cluster candidates in wf3 minus the expected number of background and foreground objects .",
    "the number density of background objects are determined from the objects in wf2 and wf4 .",
    "we must also correct for undetected faint clusters .",
    "the luminosity function of all the cluster candidates is consistent with a gaussian with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "tests then show that we are detecting 8590% of the clusters in virgo and fornax ( down to @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 in leo ( down to @xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore , we multiply the net number of detected gcs for virgo and fornax galaxies by 1.15 to correct for this incompleteness .    we also measure the corresponding galaxy luminosity in wf3 . after sky subtraction , most point sources and resolved background galaxies are removed from the image .",
    "the only cluster candidates which are not excised are the nuclei with @xmath20 ( see below ) .",
    "then , the total counts remaining in the image are summed and corrected for foreground extinction to determine @xmath21 .",
    "uncertainties range between 0.1  mag for the brightest systems to @xmath22  mag for the faintest .",
    "an important problem is the classification of galaxies into nucleated and non - nucleated samples .",
    "our first criterion for classifying nuclei is the projected radial distance , @xmath23 , from the galaxy center as defined by the centroid of the light distribution after removing any central point - like sources .",
    "the uncertainties in the central coordinates are determined by measuring centroids with a range of centering - box widths .",
    "these uncertainties yield the number of standard deviations , @xmath24 , that the central objects are offset from the centers . as a further test ,",
    "we have used monte - carlo simulations to compute the probability , @xmath25 , that an object as bright as the central cluster candidate would be found within @xmath23 of the center by chance . in each trial for a given galaxy , @xmath12 artificial clusters",
    "are drawn from a gaussian luminosity function and are given the same exponential radial distribution as measured for that galaxy .",
    "many trials are run to reduce uncertainties due to small numbers .",
    "we classify a galaxy as nucleated if the center - most cluster candidate is within 3@xmath24 of the galaxy center and @xmath26% .    in most cases",
    "the nucleus turns out to be the most luminous gc , but in a few galaxies it is significantly brighter than the typical gc . with m@xmath27",
    "these `` clusters '' are brighter than any globular cluster in the galaxy or m31 , and comparable to the brightest in m87 ( djorgovski 1993 ; battistini _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; whitmore _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . these objects may be more like true nuclei .",
    "it is unclear whether nuclei of large galaxies are kinematically and structurally distinct from star clusters or simply giant versions of the latter ( kormendy & mcclure 1993 ; carollo _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . to be conservative",
    "we have chosen not to count nuclei with m@xmath28 as clusters for the purposes of calculating @xmath0 .",
    "table  1 gives our measured values of @xmath21 , @xmath12 ( corrected for the faint end of the lf ) , @xmath0 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 by which @xmath23 differs from the galaxy center , and probability @xmath25 of finding the center - most cluster candidate within @xmath23 by chance for 24 de galaxies .",
    "the galaxies have been split into nucleated and non - nucleated categories based on the criteria mentioned above . in two cases",
    "our classification differs from the ground - based classification .",
    "fcc  324 was originally in our non - nucleated sample but we find that it is nucleated .",
    "vcc  9 has a catalog type of de1n .",
    "its most luminous cluster is close to the center , but with @xmath29  pc it is too offset to meet our criteria for being nucleated .",
    "two other galaxies may be intermediate types .",
    "vcc  1577 and fcc  48 have their most luminous gc within 3@xmath30 of their centers , but these galaxies do not fulfill the probability test .",
    "the central regions of vcc  9 and vcc  1577 are shown in figure  [ fig : offsetn ] .",
    "we have one galaxy , vcc  1254 , in common with the ground - based study of durrell _ et al . _",
    "adjusting their value to our distance modulus yields @xmath31 .",
    "our result from table  1 is @xmath32 and agrees very well with their measurement .",
    "therefore , our method appears reliable .",
    "figure  [ fig : snmv ] shows log(@xmath0 ) versus @xmath2 for all de galaxies with measured @xmath0 . in the figure , galaxies with @xmath33",
    "have been assigned @xmath34 .",
    "there is a clear trend of increasing @xmath0 with decreasing galaxy luminosity for the nucleated galaxies ( filled symbols ) .",
    "a weighted least - squares fit to the nucleated galaxies with @xmath35 gives a slope of @xmath36 ( solid line ) .",
    "the non - nucleated galaxies ( open and half - filled symbols ) do not show such a trend , a fit these points gives a slope of @xmath37 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the trend for the nucleated galaxies was seen by durrell _",
    "( 1996 ) but our larger sample now indicates that there is a difference in @xmath0  between nucleated and non - nucleated des .    at magnitudes fainter than @xmath38 the large fluctuations in @xmath0caused by small number statistics",
    "may blur the distinction between nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies .",
    "an extension of the fit to the nucleated galaxies in figure  [ fig : snmv ] passes through the points for both the fornax and sagittarius dwarfs , the des with the highest measured @xmath0 . even though the total extent of sagittarius is uncertain because of tidal disruption by the galaxy , m  54 is generally thought to be its nucleus ( sarajedini & layden 1995 )",
    "fornax is usually considered non - nucleated , but it has a high @xmath0like the other de , ns and it has a metal - rich gc only @xmath39  pc from its center .",
    "the triangle labeled `` lg dsph '' represents the @xmath40 non - nucleated local group dwarf spheroidals with @xmath33 . for",
    "now , it may be best to think of the de , ns as defining the upper envelope to the trend of increasing @xmath0  with @xmath2 .",
    "high resolution _ hst _  images of a large sample of de galaxies provide an improved estimate of their specific globular cluster frequency , and an indication that @xmath0  depends on galaxy type and luminosity .",
    "we confirm earlier ground - based estimates of a high @xmath0 for de galaxies ( durrell _ et al . _",
    "adjusted to our distances their sample of 9 de , n and 3 de , non galaxies gives a unweighted mean of @xmath41 .",
    "for comparison , our sample gives @xmath42 .",
    "these values are consistent , and are significantly higher than the mean for late type galaxies @xmath43 ( harris 1991a ) . in addition , we find for our sample that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the difference in @xmath0 between de , n and de , non in durrell _ et al .",
    "_ s sample is much less apparent , probably due to smaller sample size . the combined sample with @xmath35 shown in figure  [ fig : snmv ] yields @xmath1 and @xmath46 ; the @xmath0  for nucleated des is a factor of two higher than for non - nucleated des .",
    "this result is a further argument against the formation of de galaxies _ as a class _ via the quiescent evolution of di galaxies .",
    "the statistics of @xmath0 in dis are not very good , but typical values appear to around @xmath47 ( harris 1991a ) .",
    "simple removal of gas from a di galaxy would result in modest fading .",
    "for example , consider a galaxy that forms stars at a constant rate for 5  gyr , whereupon it is stripped of gas and ceases forming stars . in the 5  gyr after star formation ends the galaxy fades by @xmath48 mag in @xmath49 .",
    "so , if it started with @xmath47 , it would end up with @xmath50 , which is at the low end of the observed range for the des . a longer period of fading would result in higher @xmath0 , but the resulting surface brightness would tend to be fainter than measured in bright de , ns . similarly , a model in which des _ in general _ represent the quiescent periods between stochastic bursts of star formation in dis ( tyson & scalo 1988 ) appears inconsistent with the high average value of @xmath0 measured for de galaxies .",
    "the conclusion is that _ most _ bright de galaxies , and the de , ns in particular , are not simply faded or dormant di galaxies .",
    "the low mean @xmath0 among _ non - nucleated _ de galaxies suggests that any faded dis that exist in the cluster populations are likely part of this class .",
    "a number of the de , non galaxies in our sample have @xmath51 , consistent with the values measured in dis .",
    "also , our calculation above shows that _ faded _ dis would have @xmath0 close to the mean @xmath0 that we measure for the de , non class .",
    "a further argument in favor of this possibility is the observation that the non - nucleated des brighter than @xmath52 have an extended spatial distribution in the virgo and fornax clusters like the spatial distribution of spirals and irregulars .",
    "it would be interesting to search for evidence of gas either in or around some of the brighter non - nucleated de galaxies in these clusters . also , stripped dis may still exhibit rotation .",
    "the colors and luminosity functions of the gcs in des are also similar to the old , metal - poor gc populations in giant ellipticals ( paper  ii ) .",
    "therefore , gcs in both giant es and des seem to have formed at similar times , with the same metallicities , and with the same efficiencies .",
    "it is not obvious why this should be so .",
    "the velocity dispersions of typical giant ellipticals are more than 250  km  sec@xmath53 , while for de galaxies typical velocity dispersions are likely to be less than 100  km  sec@xmath53  ( bender & nieto 1990 ) .",
    "thus it appears that galaxy velocity dispersion ( and thus potential well depth ) is not a key parameter .",
    "in addition , the metallicities of our de galaxies , if adequately represented by their colors , are probably less than half solar , while the metallicities for many giant ellipticals exceed solar .",
    "thus , the current metallicity of the galaxy also does not seen to play an important role in driving @xmath0 . how can such similar gcs form in such different parent galaxies ?",
    "this can be explained if most gcs are formed in dwarf galaxy sized `` fragments '' that latter merge into giant ellipticals ( searle & zinn 1978 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ) . the fact that e galaxies and de , n galaxies inhabit the densest regions of clusters suggests that the cluster environment is somehow important for gc formation , for example through stronger interactions , higher external pressures , or higher star formation rates during the epoch of cluster formation ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; harris , harris , & mclaughlin 1998 ) .",
    "these environments would also be prone to the most merging .",
    "additional evidence for this type of scenario is the accretion of the gcs from the sagittarius dwarf into the halo of the galaxy .",
    "thus , accretion of gc - rich dwarfs may be a natural explanation of the metal - poor gcs in giant ellipticals and spirals .    turning to the trend with luminosity",
    ", our data suggests that , at least among nucleated des , less luminous galaxies have higher @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated several possible explanations for this phenomenon .",
    "first , winds may be more efficient at quenching star formation in the lower luminosity des .",
    "second , many of the original clusters may have merged into the bright nucleus . a @xmath54  m@xmath55  cluster moving at 50  km  sec@xmath53  through an isothermal halo will decay from a radius of 3  kpc in less than a hubble time ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "we have calculated that @xmath0  could decrease by a factor of about 1.5 if the nuclei brighter than @xmath56 are merged gcs .",
    "however , these nuclei do not appear to be simple conglomerates of gcs .",
    "they are on average @xmath57  mag redder in @xmath58 than the mean color of the gcs in those galaxies . if this is due to metallicity ( couture _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) , then the nuclei are about 0.3  dex more metal rich than the gcs .",
    "thus , additional nuclear star formation , perhaps as a result of interactions , may have occurred ( also see durrell _",
    "1996 ) .    in summary ,",
    "we have confirmed earlier estimates of a high globular cluster specific frequency in de galaxies in nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "further , we have shown evidence for a difference in @xmath0 between nucleated and non - nucleated des , and for a trend in @xmath0 with luminosity ( at least for the de , n galaxies ) .",
    "the results reinforce the status of de , n galaxies as the likely low - luminosity tail of the giant - e galaxy sequence , and suggest that the processes that formed both types of galaxies were related and probably influenced by the cluster environment .",
    "the present trends with luminosity and type are tentative and must be confirmed with larger samples .",
    "fortunately , these are relatively inexpensive observations to make with _ hst _ , and we are engaged in a extension of the survey that will observe up to 30 more faint des and up to 30 dis to improve the statistical comparisons .",
