    "in cells , generic information is transcribed from dna template to messenger rnas ( mrnas ) by rna polymerase ( rnap ) through a series of complex processes , called transcription .",
    "the key step that starts transcription is the binding of rnap to a special nucleotide sequence in dna , which usually lies to the upstream of transcription start site of the gene , and is called promoter @xcite .",
    "experimental data show that expression strength of corresponding gene , or protein production rate , is greatly influenced by the nucleotide sequence of promoter @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important for synthetic biology and genetic engineering to choose appropriate promoter to achieve needed expression strength .",
    "meanwhile , experiments also find that the activity of a promoter does not change with genes it expresses @xcite .",
    "it means that a promoter with strong activity in expression of one gene can always express other genes in relatively high strength .",
    "therefore , it is biologically meaningful to establish promoter libraries with promoter strength ( or activity ) changing in a large scale , as those have been experimentally done in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in order to understand the regulation mechanism of promoter in gene expression , various nucleotide sequence dependent models are also designed , which are expected to be applicable in real cells @xcite .    for a constitutive promoter , i.e. its activity",
    "is not influenced by transcription factors , the initiation rate of transcription is mainly determined by rnap binding rate to corresponding promoter . as almost all previous theoretical studies about promoter activity , this study assumes that the rnap binding rate depends only on the nucleotide sequence of promoter .",
    "it has been found that , in _ e. coli _ , promoters include two highly conserved hexamers , which are usually called @xmath1 box and @xmath0 box , and they are essential to promoter activity @xcite . in some theoretical models , only nucleotides in these two regions , as well as the discriminator region and transcription start region , are considered in detail . while for the spacing region between @xmath1 and @xmath0 boxes , only the length of it is assumed to contribute to promoter activity as a model penalty term .",
    "however , recent experimental data presented in @xcite show that promoter activity also changes with the nucleotide types in spacing region .",
    "although in some theoretical studies , nucleotides in the spacing region are also included explicitly , correlations between sequence positions in spacing region and promoter activity are not discussed @xcite . in this study , based on promoter libraries given in @xcite ,",
    "these correlations are calculated by various methods . here ,",
    "large values of correlation mean that promoter activity changes greatly with nucleotide type at this position , while small values of correlation mean that promoter activity is insensitive to the nucleotide type at this position .",
    "our results show that , except sequence positions around the @xmath1 box and @xmath0 box , nucleotides at positions @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 , which lie in the spacing region , play important roles in determining promoter activity . on the contrary , nucleotides at positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 seem to be of no significance .",
    "the importance of nucleotide hexamers in @xmath0 box and @xmath1 box of a promoter has been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this study is to find which positions in spacing region are important for promoter activity . in other words , modifications of nucleotides in these positions",
    "may change expression strength greatly . to achieve this ,",
    "a linear model is designed to describe the relationship between nucleotide sequence and promoter activity , which is based on basic principles of statistical physics and the assumption that the strength of gene expression is proportionate to rnap binding rate to promoter ( see sec . [ methods ] ) .    for the data from wang s study group @xcite , promoter sequences are only different in spacing region , i.e. from position @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "so in our analysis , only nucleotides in spacing region are considered .",
    "the data obtained by mutalik _ et al _ in @xcite consist of three groups , which are denoted by * mpl * , * rpl * , and * pilot*. but in no matter which group of them , nucleotide hexamers in @xmath0 box and @xmath1 box are not fixed .",
    "therefore , nucleotide sequence from position @xmath9 to @xmath0 are considered in our analysis . for each promoter",
    ", the length of its spacing region is 17 .",
    "the relationship between nucleotide sequence and promoter activity is described by three @xmath10mer models with @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath10mer model assumes that promoter activity can be determined by all @xmath12 adjacent nucleotide groups , and at each sequence position @xmath13 , there are altogether @xmath14 variables , which consist of all @xmath10permutations of nucleotides a , t , g , c , and @xmath15 , where @xmath15 \" means that the corresponding nucleotide is missed . due to the large number of variables , partial least squares ( pls ) regression is used in calculations . to improve model accuracy , 10-fold cross - validation",
    "is used in the pls regression ( see sec . [ methods ] ) .    for each group of experimental data of promoter strength obtained in @xcite , model coefficient values related to each sequence position can be obtained by pls regression with 10-fold cross validation .",
    "we calculate their variance and range ( defined as the difference between their maximum and minimum ) , which are regarded as two criteria of influence of the corresponding sequence position to promoter activity .",
    "the main difference between variance and range is that , variance is the average value of deviations of model coefficient values from their average while the range only describes their variation range .",
    "the main aim of this study is to analyze the correlation between sequence position , especially those in spacing region , and promoter activity by using all the four data groups in @xcite .",
    "but the scales of variances and ranges obtained from the four data groups with three versions of @xmath10mer model are different .",
    "if operating on these values directly , the information in small scale values will be absorbed by that in large scale values , and therefore they influence will be weakened inappropriately . to avoid this , we turn all variances and ranges into so - called scores by following method .",
    "we sort positions from 1 to 35 ( 17 for * wang * s data ) by their variances ( or ranges ) in descending order .",
    "the position ranked @xmath16th is scored @xmath17 ( scored @xmath18 for * wang* data ) .",
    "so far , for each data group , based on the variance and range of the three @xmath10mer models , six scores can be obtained . for convenience , scores obtained by the variance and range of @xmath10mer model",
    "are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . at the same time , another score based on f - statistic can be obtained by the following idea .",
    "if promoter activity depends greatly on a position , then the precision of corresponding model with this position neglected will be low .",
    "so its 10-fold cross - validation error will be large . using this 10-fold cross - validation error and by the same method as discussed above , one new score can be obtained for each sequence position , which is denoted by @xmath21 for simplicity . note",
    "that , in calculations of score @xmath21 , the 10-fold cross - validation errors are obtained by @xmath22mer model .    for each group of data",
    ", we have altogether seven scores . for * wang",
    "* s data , the score of position in spacing region ranges from 1 to 17 , while for other three groups of data , the score ranges from 1 to 35 . to place all scores in the same level ,",

    "this method to calculate the average score is call weighted score method ( wsm ) .    the second method to find the correlation of sequence position in spacing region to promoter activity is called four partitions method ( fpm ) . since for each data group ,",

    ", position @xmath8 , which is adjacent to the @xmath0 box , is the most important position in spacing region because it is assigned to _ important _ group three times and assigned to _ sub - important _ group one time .",
    "the important positions in spacing region which are not adjacent to @xmath1 or @xmath0 boxes are @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and the most unimportant positions are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    the third method to discuss the correlation between sequence position and promoter activity is called signed - rank and rank - sum method ( srrsm ) . in which , according to the seven scores from each data group , the sequence positions are divided into three groups by wilcoxon signed - rank test and wilcoxon rank - sum test ( see sec . [ methods ] ) , see table sviii in @xcite .",

    "the reason that we used seven different ways to calculate position score for each data group is that , generally , sort results of sequence positions obtained by different scoring methods are not the same , but we can not know which one of them is more reasonable . in previous discussion , we simply used their average to sort sequence positions in spacing region of promoter . another method to deal with this problem is to use data clustering method to exclude the scores that are much different from others . or in other words , we only keep and average the scores that give similar sort results , and exclude the ones that the sort results obtained by them are peculiar ( see sec .
