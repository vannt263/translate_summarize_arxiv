    "@xcite in addition to zpls , the fluorescence spectra of both centers exhibit a broad and intense vibronic band at lower energy .",
    "a single nv center , as a single - photon emitter , is characterized by a second - order time - intensity correlation function that exhibits a photon antibunching dip at zero delay . in a first approach ,",
    "the photophysics of nv centers can be modeled by a two - level system with two photophysical parameters , the excitation rate , and the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "however , with increasing excitation power , the nv center , more particularly in the negative state nv , can experience distinctive photon bunching at finite coincidence time , in addition to the expected antibunching at zero delay .",
    "this can be accounted for within a three - level system with additional photophysical parameters to describe photon decays to , or from , the additional shelving level .",

    "+ the statistics of both nv charge states has been studied previously in nd samples similar to those studied here and it was found to be size dependent , with a larger occurrence ( > 80% ) of the nv center over the entire size range from 20 to 80  nm .",
    "@xcite in the present study , we further observed that most of the single nv centers being detected as neutral from their fluorescence spectrum at low illumination power ( < 0.5  mw ) progressively gain with increasing power a photochromic character in that they also exhibit the nv zpl in addition to the nv zpl .",

    "we also describe the photophysics of such a photochromic nv over the same power range as the non - photochromic centers and show how both photophysics can be linked .",

    "as far as the @xmath61 parameter is concerned , it remains at a constant value @xmath81 for the nv , while it increases up to @xmath82 for the nv .",

    ", we deduce the three other parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ kijbc ] for both nvs .",
    "the first point to notice is that for both nvs , the @xmath56 parameter increases linearly with the pumping rate from zero to a value exceeding @xmath57 for @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , for nv , we see that @xmath90 increases , but keeps very small values compared to the other parameters , in agreement with the assumptions made in eq .",
    "however , for nv , the same parameters are no longer negligible compared to the set of @xmath57 , @xmath56 values .",
    "they even overtake @xmath57 for @xmath91 .",
    "however , we emphasize that assuming @xmath57 constant , if natural , is actually not fully demonstrated . in order to check",
    "how robust this hypothesis is , we will now try to approach the values and evolutions of the @xmath49 parameters that were obtained here by modulating the collection efficiency @xmath66 using eq .",
    "now we use the fourth equation eq .",
    "17 to calculate the @xmath49 parameters . as already stated , we do not know exactly the @xmath66 parameter but , as it turns out , slight variations in @xmath66 can produce significant changes in @xmath49 . to find the correct value of @xmath66 , we adopt the following procedure .",
    "we let its value vary continuously and calculate the evolutions of the slope and y - intercept of the linear regressions made with the obtained @xmath92 traces .",
    "the slope should vanish because @xmath57 is assumed to be constant , whereas the y - intercept should reach the value obtained previously , i.e. , the value of @xmath59 at zero excitation .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath94 , which differs only by a factor 2 from the nv case .",
    "this appears reasonable since the measurements were not carried out the same day ( optical alignments might be slightly different ) and the collection efficiency @xmath66 also depends on the unknown transition - dipole orientation in both nvs .      fig .",
    "[ kijbcm ] depicts the @xmath95 curves deduced from the previous optimization .",
    "it is found that the order of magnitude of the coefficients is the same as for imposed @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , the relaxation rate @xmath90 is unchanged because it only depends on the @xmath10 fit parameters , eq .  15 .",
    "for the two nv centers , the excitation rate vanishes in the absence of any excitation power and linearly increases with @xmath73 as it should .",
    "the main difference between both centers comes from the evolution of @xmath96 , @xmath90 and @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , for nv , @xmath96 and @xmath90 remain very small compared to @xmath57 , which is almost constant ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 if @xmath73 tends to zero ) .",
    "therefore , the third level plays little role in the photodynamics of the nv center .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that although very small , @xmath96 is not zero for nv ( errors bars are within the symbol size in fig .",
    "[ kijbcm ] ( a ) , right panel ) , which confirms the very existence of the third metastable level for this charge state .",
    "regarding the @xmath10 curves , it implies that the optical channel 2 to 1 is favored , which prevents any significant bunching .",
    "furthermore , for the nv the narrowing of the antibunching dip is due to the increasing excitation rate as for a two - level system , i.e. , eq .  2 ( see ref .",

    "although the physical justification of this finding is beyond our phenomenological treatment , it is likely that the variation of @xmath57 and @xmath96 with excitation power is due to a change in the local energy environment of the nv center at high power , in particular because the efficient coupling with the phonon bath in the diamond matrix is expected to be temperature sensitive .",

    "in contrast , the nv quantum yield decreases dramatically with increasing excitation power from a starting @xmath104 to @xmath105 at high power .",

    "@xcite recently , it was also found that resonant excitation of the nv and nv states in ultrapure synthetic iia bulk diamond can induce reversible charge conversion in cryogenic conditions even at low power .",
    "@xcite this was taken as evidence that the charge conversion process is intrinsic in this sort of diamond , not assisted by an electron donor or acceptor state .",
    "the goal of this section is to give additional information on nv photochromism detected in surface - purified nds , 25  nm in size , subjected to a cw non - resonant excitation of increasing power . by comparing the behavior of a single photochromic center to that of non - photochromic centers in the same illumination conditions",
    "as described above , we gain valuable information on the rich photophysics of photochromism .",
    "+ for the purpose of studying photochromism , we use two additional configurations of the hbt correlator that differ only by the set of bandpass filters added in the interferometer branches .",
    "these configurations , called nv , and nv respectively , are shown schematically in fig .  [ hbtnv ] .     +    in contrast to fig .",
    "[ hbt](a ) , these two configurations add selective bandpass filters in the interferometer branches . the nv configuration in fig .  [ hbtnv ] ( a ) ( respectively nv configuration in fig .",
    "[ hbtnv ] ( b ) ) uses a filter selective to the nv ( respectively nv ) fluorescence in the start ( respectively stop ) branch .",
    "therefore , in the nv configuration , a single photon emitted by a nv center and detected in apd1 gives the start signal to the counting module , whereas a single nv photon subsequently detected in apd2 produces the stop signal .",
    "the nv configuration works in just the complementary way .",
    "note that our nv configuration is similar to the cross - correlation technique used in ref .",
    "these schemes turn out to be very powerful to study photochromism since cross correlation can be expected only if nv and nv photons originate from the same defect center .",
    "note that related techniques have also successfully been applied to identify various excitonic species emitted by single semiconductor quantum dots , see for instance .",
    "@xcite +     +    with the above setup , we have located a few rare nds hosting a single nv center that showed charge conversion at low excitation power already . in the following , we consider such a nd hosting a single photochromic nv center .",

    "it reveals a clear antibunching dip at zero delay .",

    "@xmath108 we deduce the actual value of @xmath109 .",
    "@xcite from these results , a natural interpretation for the observation of the nv and nv zpls together with nv uniqueness is that this particular nd is subjected to photochromism .",
    "in addition to the antibunching dip at zero delay , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ spectres ] that @xmath10 exceeds 1 at longer delays .",
    "@xcite in agreement with the previous sections , this is evidence for the presence of a trapping level and calls for a three - level description of the photochromic nv .",

    "although our study of nv photochromism is limited to a particular example we suggest that the dynamics of the system involves probably all energy levels of the nv and nv with some possible hybridization .",
    "it could be interesting to know , whether or not , the third level involved in the photochromic case is identical in nature to the third level of the nv .",

    "however , the electronic delay @xmath118 ns included in the hbt correlator setup implies that sometimes even a photon emitted , say at time @xmath119 , by a nv- is recorded after a second photon emitted later by the nv0 state , i.e. , at @xmath120 .",

    "+ interestingly , the last finding implies that after the emission of a photon in the spectral fluorescence band of the nv- the delayed emission of a second photon in the spectral band of the nv0 , i.e. , the conditional probability given by eq .

    "it was found that the relaxation from nv- to nv0 is a very slow process occurring with a decay time @xmath133 .",
    "this agrees with our finding in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] since , even if the full dynamics of the photochromic nv center is expected to depend on the energy levels of both the nv- and nv0 centers , it is clearly the nv- characteristics which dominate during the transition associated with eq .",
    "a similar qualitative analysis can be done in the nv0 to nv- center conversion .",
    "the small dissymmetry between the two parts of the curves for positive and negative delays results from the presence of a small nv0 contribution to the dynamics during the nv0 to nv- transition which is absent in the nv- to nv0 conversion . clearly",

    "to summarize , we have experimentally studied the fluorescence photodynamics of nv- and nv0 centers in diamond nanocrystals of 50  nm size or below using hbt photon - correlation measurements as a function of the excitation power .",
    "the dynamics was theoretically modeled using einstein s rate equations and the transition probability rates @xmath49 entering the three - level model developed to analyze the data were deduced and used to infer a quantum efficiency to both charge states of the nv .",
    "it has been found that the shelving state , though present , plays a very small role on the neutral center in those small diamond crystals .",
    "the narrowing of the antibunching dip observed with increasing power for this center is a simple power effect that does not affect the near unity quantum efficiency .",
    "in contrast , the negative center experiences a distinctive photon bunching behavior at finite delay that increases with increasing power . this reflects the increasing role of the shelving state for this center , which in turn diminishes the quantum efficiency from near unity at low power to approximately 0.3 at high power .",
    "we have also studied the dynamics of a photochromic center .",
    "it reveals a rich phenomenology that is essentially dominated by the negative face of the center . in the future",
