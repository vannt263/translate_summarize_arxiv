    "the observation of the jet quenching and of the strong azimuthally asymmetric flow shows that in a high energy heavy - ion collision at ultrarelativistic energies a dense and hot droplet of matter is formed . event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations @xcite are used to provide the response of the collective flow to the deformations of the fluctuating initial state . the eccentricity and triangularity of the initial density result in the formation of the elliptic and triangular flow in the spectra @xcite . not only the average , but the whole distribution of the harmonic flow coefficients @xmath0 @xcite",

    "the event - by event distribution of the hydrodynamic response shows that @xmath1 and @xmath2 follow the initial distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with nonlinearities in the response appearing for the harmonics @xmath5 and higher .",

    "the odd and even components of the directed flow @xmath6 as a function of pseudorapidity , appear from the expansion of a tilted , fluctuating fireball @xcite .",
    "the harmonic event - plane for each order can be determined from the initial density @xcite , while the hydrodynamic evolution that involves nonlinear coupling between harmonics yields additional correlations between the event planes , in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "fluctuations may lead to a decorrelation of the event planes at different rapidities @xcite , a prediction that could be tested experimentally .",
    "fluctuations of the volume of the initial fireball lead to event - by - event fluctuations of the average transverses momentum @xcite , in an analogous way as for the response of the flow harmonics to the fireball anisotropies .",

    "advanced hydrodynamic calculations are used to extract the properties of the quark - gluon plasma at different temperatures @xcite and barionic densities @xcite .",
    "the hard equation of state of the quark - gluon plasma leads to a rapid build up of the transverse flow , which implies a strong dependence of the femtoscopic radii on the pion pair momentum @xcite .",
    "the p - pb collisions have been proposed as a laboratory to study the initial state effects and to obtain reference data for the pb - pb collisions @xcite . on the other hand , it has been predicted that collective expansion of the fireball formed in central p - pb collisions is significant and can lead to observable elliptic and triangular flow @xcite .",
    "experiments with p - pb collisions at the lhc measure two - particle correlation function in relative pseudorapidity @xmath7 and relative azimuthal angle @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional correlation function presents two ridge - like structures , elongated in pseudorapidity , with pairs collimated in the same direction ( same - side ridge , @xmath9 ) and in the opposite direction ( away - side ridge , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the azimuthal structure in the two - dimensional correlation function can be understood as an effect of the azimuthally asymmetric collective flow and of the transverse momentum conservation @xcite , in a similar way as in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",

    "@xcite it has been proposed to look for collectivity in small systems using d - a collisions . in central d - a collisions the density profile in the transverse plane is determined by the deuteron wave - function , hence the eccentricity @xmath3 is large @xmath11 , which gives a large elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "the analysis of correlation functions in d - au collisions at rhic shows a strong @xmath1 component @xcite , but quantitative conclusions are difficult due to large non - flow contributions in the low multiplicity environment at the rhic energies .",

    "the small size and short lifetime of the system make the final results depend significantly on other parameters of the model as well : the initial time of the expansion , the freeze - out temperature , the shear viscosity .",
    "an additional difficulty in comparing to the experimental data is related to the large contribution of non - flow correlations that are not implemented in the models .",
    "the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics can be reliably applied if the velocity gradients in the system are moderate and if the mean free path is smaller than the size of the system . in small systems",
    "the contribution of non - thermal corona is relatively more important , which can reduce the value of the elliptic flow .",

    "it has been generally expected that in p - pb collisions at the lhc , the final state interactions would be negligible @xcite , but the hydrodynamic model applied to initial conditions extrapolated to the p - pb system at tev energies predicted a significant collective expansion @xcite that could be observed as the elliptic and triangular flow .",
