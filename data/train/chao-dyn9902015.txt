    "@xcite ,  @xcite introduced the `` alpha models '' for the mean motion of ideal incompressible fluids as the @xmath8-dimensional generalization of the one - dimensional camassa - holm ( ch ) equation .",
    "the 1d ch equation describes shallow water waves with nonlinear dispersion and admits soliton solutions called `` peakons ''  @xcite .",
    "its @xmath8-dimensional generalization describes the slow time dynamics of fluids in which nonlinear dispersion accounts for the effects of the small scale rapid variability upon the mean motion .",
    "the fluid transport velocity is found by inversion of a helmholtz operator acting on fluid circulation ( or momentum ) velocity .",
    "this operator contains a length scale that corresponds to the magnitude of the fluctuation covariance ; the application of this operator smoothes the transport velocity relative to the circulation velocity .",
    "this length scale is denoted by @xmath9 in references  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hence the name _ alpha models _ for these mean fluid motion theories .",
    "the alpha models for self consistent mean fluid dynamics are derived by applying temporal averaging procedures to hamilton s principle for an ideal incompressible fluid flow .",
    "the resulting mean fluid motion equations are obtained by using the euler - poincar variational framework  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "( euler - poincar equations are the lagrangian version of lie - poisson hamiltonian systems . ) therefore , these equations possess conservation laws for energy and momentum , as well as a kelvin - noether circulation theorem that establishes how the time average ( or perhaps statistical ) properties of the fluctuations affect the circulation of the mean flow",
    ". these ideal fluid equations also describe geodesic motion on the volume - preserving diffeomorphism group for a metric containing the @xmath10 norm of the mean fluid velocity .",
    "their geometrical properties are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "their relation to eulerian and lagrangian mean fluid theories is discussed in  @xcite . in recognition of their origins , these mean fluid motion equations may be known equally well by either the name alpha models , or ch equations .",
    "chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced phenomenological viscosity into the ch equation and proposed the resulting viscous camassa - holm equation ( vche ) as a closure approximation for the reynolds averaged equations of the incompressible navier - stokes fluid .",
    "they tested this approximation on turbulent channel and pipe flows with steady mean , by finding analytical solutions of the vche for the mean velocity and the reynolds shear stress and comparing them with experiments  @xcite .",
    "they found that the steady vche profiles are consistent with data obtained from mean flow turbulence measurements in most of the flow region for channels and pipes at moderate to high reynolds numbers .",
    "thus , chen _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated a connection between turbulence and the vche for steady , or mean solutions .",
    "in fact , the _ time - dependent _ vche in a periodic box has unique classical solutions and a global attractor whose fractal dimension is finite and scales according to kolmogorov s estimate , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the kolmogorov dissipation length  @xcite .",
    "we note that the time - dependent vche model is _ not _ equivalent to the navier - stokes equations with hyperviscosity , see  @xcite  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the vche model is also known as the navier - stokes alpha model , or the viscous alpha model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the statistics and structures of the velocity and vorticity fields at moderate reynolds numbers in a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the viscous alpha model with the corresponding results for the navier - stokes equations . through this comparison ,",
    "we hope to determine whether the navier - stokes alpha model can be used as a subgrid model for fluid turbulence .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : the mathematical background of the viscous alpha model and its connections with the navier - stokes equations are given in the next section .",
    "the remainder of the paper compares the classical navier - stokes dns turbulence results with those for the viscous alpha models . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical methodology and energy spectra .",
    "stretching dynamics , including the vorticity structure and the alignment phenomena are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we present various two - point statistics , including the probability density function ( pdf ) of the velocity increment and the velocity structure functions . concluding remarks are given in section vi .",
    "holm , marsden , and ratiu  @xcite ,  @xcite used variational asymptotics to obtain evolution equations for the eulerian mean hydrodynamic motion of ideal incompressible fluids , employing an approximation of hamilton s principle for euler s equation in a euclidean space setting .",
    "the method assumes that the euler flow may be decomposed into its mean and fluctuating components at a fixed position in space . in their approach ,",
    "a first - order taylor expansion in the fluctuation amplitude is used to approximate the velocity field with the result that the @xmath13 metric in the hamilton s principle giving rise to the euler equations is replaced by an @xmath10 metric that produces the evolution equation of the eulerian mean flow .",
    "we shall call this evolution equation the euler alpha model , or the @xmath8-dimensional ch equation .",
    "holm et al .",
    "@xcite give a geometrically intrinsic ( i.e. , coordinate free ) derivation of these averaged equations by the procedure of _ variational asymptotics _",
    ", namely , by deriving an averaged lagrangian and using this lagrangian to generate the equations via hamilton s principle . this intrinsic setting is useful because many interesting flows , e.g. , flows on spheres such as those in geophysics , do occur on manifolds .",
    "the standard decomposition into mean and fluctuating components is an additive decomposition , only valid in the presence of a vector space structure .",
    "we follow holm  @xcite in presenting the derivation in euclidean space .",
    "we develop the euler - poincar theory of advected fluctuations from the viewpoint of eulerian averaging .",
    "our point of departure is a lagrangian comprised of the fluid kinetic energy in the eulerian description , in which volume preservation is imposed by a lagrange multiplier @xmath14 ( the pressure ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the eulerian volume element .",
    "we assume that there are two time scales for the motion : the fast time @xmath17 and the slow time @xmath18 .",
    "the traditional reynolds decomposition of fluid velocity into its fast and slow components is expressed at a given position @xmath19 in terms of the eulerian mean fluid velocity @xmath20 as @xmath21 following holm  @xcite , we assume the eulerian velocity fluctuation @xmath22 is related to an eulerian fluid parcel displacement fluctuation  denoted as @xmath23  by @xmath24 for purely eulerian velocity fluctuations as in eq .",
    "( [ re - vel - decomp ] ) , this relation separates into two relations : the `` taylor - like '' hypothesis of  @xcite , @xmath25 and the relation  @xcite ,  @xcite @xmath26 hence , the reynolds velocity decomposition ( [ re - vel - decomp ] ) separates the lagrangian ( [ lag - eul - a ] ) into its mean and fluctuating pieces as @xmath27 no modification is needed in the pressure constraint in this lagrangian , because the eulerian mean _ preserves _ the condition that the velocity be divergence free ; hence , @xmath28 .",
    "it remains only to take the eulerian mean of this lagrangian , in which we assume @xmath29 .",
    "the eulerian mean averaging process at fixed position @xmath19 is denoted @xmath30 with , e.g. , @xmath31 by eq .",
    "( [ u - prime - zeta ] ) , the eulerian mean kinetic energy due to the velocity fluctuation satisfies @xmath32 thus , we find the following eulerian mean lagrangian , @xmath33 + p({\\bf x},t ) \\big(1- d({\\bf x},t ) \\big)\\right\\}\\;.\\ ] ] the advection relation ( [ taylor - like - hypoth ] ) implies the same advective velocity for each component of the symmetric eulerian mean covariance tensor @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath35 together , this relation and the continuity equation for the volume element @xmath16 , @xmath36 complete the auxiliary equations needed for deriving the equation of motion for the eulerian mean velocity @xmath20 from the averaged lagrangian @xmath37 in ( [ lag - eul - b ] ) by using the euler - poincar theory .",
    "the results of @xcite allow one to compute the euler - poincar equation for the lagrangian @xmath37 in ( [ lag - eul - b ] ) depending on the eulerian mean velocity @xmath20 , and the advected quantities @xmath16 and @xmath38 as @xmath39 we compute the following variational derivatives of the averaged approximate lagrangian @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ lag - eul - b ] ) @xmath41 the euler - poincar eq .",
    "( [ epeqn - lbar - e ] ) for this averaged lagrangian takes the form , @xmath42 its definition as a variational derivative indicates that @xmath43 is a specific momentum in a certain sense dual to the velocity @xmath20 . for more discussion of physical interpretations of @xmath20 and @xmath43 , see @xcite .",
    "the euler - poincar equations ( [ epeqn - emm ] )  ( [ vee - redef - e ] ) define the eulerian mean motion ( emm ) model .",
    "incompressibility of the eulerian mean velocity @xmath20 follows from the continuity equation ( [ cont - eqn - a ] ) and the constraint @xmath44 .",
    "a natural set of boundary conditions is @xmath45 then , provided the helmholtz operator @xmath46 for @xmath47 may be inverted , the eulerian mean pressure @xmath14 may be obtained by solving an elliptic equation .      when the eulerian mean covariance is isotropic and homogeneous , so that @xmath48 ( for a constant length scale @xmath9 , whose magnitude is set by the initial conditions for the eulerian mean covariance ) then the emm equation ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) * reduces * to the @xmath8-dimensional camassa - holm equation introduced in  @xcite ,  @xcite , namely , @xmath49 this @xmath8-dimensional ch equation set is an invariant subsystem of the euler - poincar system ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) , with definition ( [ vee - redef - e ] ) and advection law ( [ cov - dyn - e ] ) , because the homogeneous isotropic initial condition @xmath50 is invariant under the dynamics of equation ( [ cov - dyn - e ] )",
    ". hence , any of the formulae above remain valid if we set @xmath51 , with constant @xmath9 .",
    "equations of the type ( [ nd : cheqn ] ) but with additional dissipative terms were considered previously in the theory of second grade fluids  @xcite and were treated recently in the mathematical literature  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "second grade fluid models are derived from continuum mechanical principles of objectivity and material frame indifference , after which thermodynamic principles such as the clausius - duhem relation and stability of stationary equilibrium states are imposed to restrict the allowed values of the parameters in these models .",
    "in contrast , the ch equation ( [ nd : cheqn ] ) is derived here by applying asymptotic expansions , eulerian means , and an assumption of isotropy of fluctuations in hamilton s principle for an ideal incompressible fluid .",
    "this derivation provides the interpretation of the length scale @xmath9 as the typical amplitude of the rapid fluctuations whose eulerian mean is taken in hamilton s principle .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional ch equation ( [ nd : cheqn ] ) implies the conservation of energy @xmath52 and helicity @xmath53 .",
    "its steady vortical flows include the analogs of the beltrami flows @xmath54 . in the periodic case",
    ", we define @xmath55 as the @xmath56-th fourier mode of the specific momentum @xmath57 ; so that @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the leray projection onto fourier modes transverse to @xmath56 ( this ensures incompressibility ) .",
    "hence , the nonlinear coupling among the modes is suppressed by the denominator when @xmath60 .",
    "an essential feature of the @xmath8-dimensional ch equation ( [ nd : cheqn ] ) is that its specific momentum @xmath43 is transported by a velocity @xmath20 that is smoothed , or filtered , by application of the inverse elliptic helmholtz operator @xmath61 .",
    "the effect on length scales smaller than @xmath9 is that steep gradients of the specific momentum @xmath43 tend not to steepen much further , and that thin vortex tubes tend not to get much thinner as they are transported .",
    "furthermore , as our present numerical simulations shall verify , the effect on length scales larger than @xmath9 is negligible . hence , the @xmath8-dimensional ch equation preserves the assumptions under which it is derived .",
    "the stokes mean drift velocity is defined by  @xcite , @xmath62 hence , eq . ( [ u - prime - zeta ] ) implies @xmath63 where @xmath64 and we argue that @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath66 satisfies , to order @xmath67 , @xmath68 therefore to this order , @xmath66 in the emm theory is the lagrangian mean velocity .",
    "being euler  poincar , the eulerian mean motion ( emm ) equation ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) and its invariant reduced form the ch equation ( [ nd : cheqn ] ) for @xmath50 has a corresponding kelvin - noether circulation theorem , @xmath69 for any closed curve @xmath70 that moves with the eulerian mean fluid velocity @xmath71 and surface @xmath72 with boundary @xmath70 .",
    "thus in this kelvin - noether circulation theorem , the presence of spatial gradients in the eulerian mean fluctuation covariance @xmath38 creates circulation of the lagrangian mean velocity @xmath73 .      in three dimensions , the emm equation ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) may be expressed in its equivalent `` curl '' form , as @xmath74 the curl of this equation in turn yields an equation for transport and creation for the lagrangian mean vorticity , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and we have used incompressibility of @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath71 is the transport velocity for the generalized vorticity @xmath77 , and the expected vortex stretching term @xmath78 is accompanied by an additional vortex creation term proportional to the eulerian mean covariance gradient .",
    "of course , this additional term is also responsible for the creation of circulation of @xmath66 in the kelvin - noether circulation theorem ( [ kelthm - e ] ) and vanishes when the eulerian mean covariance is homogeneous in space , thereby recovering the corresponding result for the three dimensional ch equation  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "noether s theorem guarantees conservation of energy for the euler - poincar equations ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) , since the eulerian mean lagrangian @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ lag - eul - b ] ) has no explicit dependence on time .",
    "this constant energy is given by @xmath79 thus , the total kinetic energy is the integrated product of the eulerian mean and lagrangian mean velocities . in this kinetic energy , the eulerian mean covariance of the fluctuations couples to the gradients of the eulerian mean velocity .",
    "so there is a cost in kinetic energy for the system either to increase these gradients , or to increase the eulerian mean covariance .",
    "noether s theorem also guarantees conservation of momentum for the euler - poincar equation ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) , since the eulerian mean lagrangian @xmath40 in eq .",

    "when dissipation and forcing are added to the emm motion equation ( [ epeqn - emm ] ) by using the phenomenological viscosity @xmath81 and forcing @xmath82 , one finds a * second moment eulerian mean turbulence model * given by @xmath83 with viscous boundary conditions @xmath84 , @xmath85 at a fixed boundary .",
    "note that the eulerian mean fluctuation covariance @xmath86 appears in the dissipation operator @xmath87 . in the absence of the forcing @xmath82 ,",

    ".    one of the most important properties of the vortex stretching dynamics in the navier - stokes turbulence is the so - called alignment phenomenon@xcite , in which the three - dimensional vorticity is locally preferentially aligned with the direction of the second eigenvector of the symmetric strain - rate tensor , @xmath154 . in three - dimensional space",

    "however , the flatnesses of the pdfs ( 5.0 , 4.1 and 3.8 for @xmath152 and @xmath138 , respectively ) decrease with increasing @xmath9",
    ". the observed reduction of small scale intermittency is consistent with the energy spectra in fig .  1 where the high @xmath147 energy spectra are truncated for large @xmath9 values",
    ". the skewnesses of the pdfs are @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in fig",
    ".  9 , we present the normalized pdfs of the velocity increment , @xmath182 in the inertial range when the separation @xmath183 ( in mesh units ) .",
    "it is seen that all three pdfs collapse quite well for most values of @xmath184 , implying that the fundamental features of the two - point statistics in the inertial range do not change much as @xmath9 varies .",
    "this is a very desirable feature in using the alpha model as a subgrid model .    in fig .",
    "10 , we show the second - order structure function , @xmath185 , versus @xmath186 at different alpha values .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath186 less than @xmath135 mesh points , the taylor expansion gives a simple scaling : @xmath187 . in the narrow inertial range ( @xmath188 ) ,",
    "the simulation results with @xmath136 and @xmath137 agree qualitatively with the kolmogorov @xmath189 scaling@xcite .",
    "the slightly slower than @xmath189 growth may indicate the intermittent correction .",
    "for the case of @xmath143 , the filtering of small scale motions significantly decreases the structure function in the inertial range . for this case",
    ", the @xmath189 scaling can only been seen for the very narrow region @xmath190 .    in fig .",
    "11 , we present the flatness of the velocity increment , @xmath191 , versus the normalized separation , @xmath192 . the normalization length is taken to be half the box length @xmath193 . as expected , in the small scale region with @xmath194 ,",
    "the alpha model is quite different from the navier stokes dynamics and the navier - stokes equation has the largest flatness value , implying that the navier - stokes turbulence is more intermittent than the alpha model dynamics , consistent with the vortex visualization in fig .",
    "it is very interesting to note , however , that the flatnesses versus @xmath192 are almost identical for all three alpha values studied in the narrow inertial range .",
    "the decaying of the flatness as a function of @xmath192 implies the existence of an intermittency correction for the scaling exponents .",
    "the numerical measurement gives @xmath195 in the inertial range .",
    "this scaling exponent agrees qualitatively with the value of @xmath196 from other direct numerical simulation results@xcite .",
    "our main objective in this paper has been to investigate the utility of the recently proposed alpha equations as a subgrid scale model for three- dimensional turbulence .",
    "our main tool has been direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of turbulence in a periodic box .",
    "our conclusions are based on comparisons of dns using the navier - stokes alpha equations for several values of the alpha parameter , including the limiting case @xmath197 in which the navier - stokes equations are recovered .",
    "our principal conclusion is that the alpha model simulations can reproduce most of the large scale features of navier - stokes turbulence _ even when these simulations do not resolve the fine scale dynamics _",
    ", at least in the case of turbulence in a periodic box .",
    "we summarized known analytic properties of the alpha models , including an outline of their derivation and the associated assumptions , their simplification for the case of constant alpha , and their conservation properties .",
    "we also offered interpretations of nonlinear dynamics of the alpha models and indicated the changes one might expect from the dynamics of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "one of our principal computational results is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where two dns simulations at @xmath198 , but using two different resolutions , are compared with each other and with a navier - stokes simulation ( representing truth ) . the spectra are identical for the larger wavelengths , demonstrating ( in this case ) that one does not need to resolve the small scale dynamics to reproduce the large scale features of the turbulence .",
    "we further compared vorticity structures and alignment , and also two point statistics to illustrate the altered dynamics of the alpha models .",
    "in general , we found consistency of these dns results with our expectations based on analysis .",
    "the use of the alpha equations as a subgrid model of turbulent flows in more complicated geometries and forcings remains to be studied .",
    "however we believe these first results are very promising .",
