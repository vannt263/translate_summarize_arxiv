    "our comprehension of the dynamics underlying strong interactions in the hadronic low - energy region is entangled due to our lack of knowledge on the implementation of quantum chromodynamics in the non - perturbative regime . in spite of the success of qcd in the description of strong interactions at large energies , in the domain of asymptotic freedom ,",
    "the study of processes involving the lower part of the hadronic spectrum ( characteristically @xmath0 ) is not feasible with a strong interaction theory written in terms of dynamical quarks and gluons . ideally the way out would be to trade partonic qcd for a dual theory written in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom , i.e. mesons and baryons .",
    "however we do not ( yet ) know how to proceed to reach this goal . in ref .",
    "@xcite i already pointed out different approaches that are usually followed in order to describe the phenomenology of hadrons ( other than lattice gauge calculations ) , namely ad - hoc parameterisations , phenomenological lagrangian models and effective field theories .",
    "i recall their main features  : + _ parameterisations _ + the main goal is to provide an expression for the amplitudes on account of the supposedly known dynamics that drives the process  : resonance saturation , polology , etc .",
    "the simplicity of these parameterisations allows their easy implementation in the analyses of experimental data , however the connection between the parameters and qcd is not known .",
    "moreover the initial dynamical assumptions are uncontrolled and may be in conflict with the underlying theory , therefore very little is learned from nature from this approach .",
    "+ _ models of phenomenological lagrangians _ + written in terms of hadron fields , phenomenological lagrangians are driven by assumptions whose link with qcd is , in many cases , not clear .",
    "well known examples of these models describing the strong interaction in the presence of resonances are the hidden symmetry or gauge symmetry lagrangians @xcite where vector mesons are introduced as gauge bosons of suggested local symmetries .",
    "+ _ effective field theories _ + chiral symmetry of massless qcd and its spontaneous breaking can be used to construct a strong interaction field theory involving the lightest @xmath1 octet of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2 ) , it has been very much useful in the study of strong interaction effects at very low energy , namely @xmath3 ( being @xmath4 the mass of the @xmath5 , the lightest hadron not included in the theory ) , and it is an illustration of an effective field theory ( eft ) . the latter tries to embody the main features of the fundamental theory in order to handle this one in a specific energy regime where it is , whether more inconvenient or just impossible , to apply it @xcite . in order to proceed to the construction of an eft it is necessary the existence of a gap in the spectrum of masses that sets apart those degrees of freedom",
    "to be integrated out from those whose dynamics remain in the theory . in @xmath2 , for instance , it is the one separating the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons from the light - flavoured resonance states .",
    "+ semileptonic processes stemmed from the hadronization of qcd currents into exclusive channels constitute singular physical systems where the study of non - perturbative strong dynamics is easier than in pure non - leptonic processes .",
    "this is so because , on one side , lepton and hadron sectors factorise cleanly and , moreover , exclusive channels give valuable information on the dynamics of the interaction itself , hence on the realization of the non - perturbative strong interaction in this energy region .",
    "in addition a good deal of information is known about form factors of qcd currents from different model - independent sources such as parton dynamics , analyticity or unitarity .",
    "the latter also pervade general amplitudes but their application on the form factors is much simpler .",
    "the tau lepton , @xmath6 @xcite , decays hadronically in an energy region populated by light - flavoured resonances .",
    "hence exclusive semileptonic tau decays offer a unique setting where to explore resonance dynamics through the form factors arisen in the hadronization of qcd currents . within the standard model the matrix amplitude for the exclusive hadronic decays of the tau lepton , @xmath7 ,",

    "structure functions can be written in terms of the relevant form factors and kinematical components .",
    "they contain the dynamics of the hadronic decay and their reconstruction can be accomplished through the study of spectral functions or angular distributions of data .",
    "the number of structure functions depends , clearly , of the number of hadrons in the final state . for a two - pseudoscalar case",
    "there are 4 of them . for a three - pseudoscalar process",
    "the total number of structure functions is 16 .",
    "i will focus in the decays of the tau lepton into a few channels with two and three pseudoscalars .",
    "the theoretical description of the dynamics that drives the decays into more than three pseudoscalars still relies in the model - independent isospin counting @xcite .",
    "as already commented , strong interaction dynamics in hadronic tau decays involves the resonance energy region , hence it is driven by those states .",
    "this is the well known concept of _ resonance dominance _ that has pervaded hadron dynamics since the first stages of the study of the strong interaction .",
    "it is a widespread common lore that resonances should be functionally described by breit - wigner parameterisations . while it is clear that polology demands this structure , its connection with qcd is still lacking .",
    "in fact it has already been proven , for instance , that the description of hadronic tau decays through them is not consistent with the chiral symmetry of massless qcd @xcite .",
    "experiments like aleph , cleo , delphi and opal @xcite have collected an important set of experimental data on hadronic decays of the tau lepton into exclusive channels . in the last two years both babar and belle experiments have joined in this effort @xcite , and the prospects for a superb factory are very much promising @xcite .",
    "analyses of these data are usually carried out using the tauola library @xcite that includes parameterisations of the hadronic matrix elements . at present",
    "the latter only includes breit - wigner specifications for the form factors .",
    "its application to the hadronization of charged qcd currents in tau decays has a long story @xcite that boils down into a series of articles @xcite that carry an exhaustive analysis of the tau decays up to three pseudoscalars .",
    "the presently employed parameterisation , the generalized khn - santamara model ( gks ) , is obtained by combining breit - wigner factors ( @xmath15 ) , in general non - linearly , according to the expected resonance dominance in each channel , for instance , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalisation required to fulfill the chiral symmetry expansion at @xmath18",
    ". then data are analysed by fitting the @xmath19 parameters and those present in the breit - wigner factors ( masses , on - shell widths ) .",
    "two different functions are applied  : + a ) _ khn - santamara model _ + the breit - wigner factors are given by @xcite @xmath20 that guarantees the right asymptotic behaviour , ruled by qcd , for the form factors .",
    "+ b ) _ gounaris - sakurai model _   + originally constructed to study the role of the @xmath21 resonance in the vector form factor of the pion @xcite , its use has been extended to other hadronic resonances @xcite .",
    "the breit - wigner function now reads  : @xmath22 where @xmath23 carries information on the specific dynamics of the resonance and @xmath24 can be read from ref .",
    "+ the procedure applied by the experimental groups when using these parameterisations @xcite is to regard both models and consider the discrepancy between them as an estimate of the theoretical error .",
    "at variance with @xmath2 , the lack of a mass gap between the spectrum of light - flavoured meson resonances and the perturbative continuum ( let us say @xmath25 ) prevents the construction of an appropriate eft to handle the strong interaction in the energy region spanned by tau decays .",
    "however there are several tools that allow us to grasp relevant features of qcd and to implement them in an eft - like lagrangian model .",
    "the two key premises are the following  :    \\1 ) a theorem put forward by s.  weinberg @xcite and worked out by h.  leutwyler @xcite states that , if one writes down the most general possible lagrangian , including all terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles , and then calculates matrix elements with this lagrangian to any given order of perturbation theory , the result will be the most general possible s - matrix amplitude consistent with analyticity , perturbative unitarity , cluster decomposition and the principles of symmetry that have been specified .",
    "\\2 ) it has been suggested @xcite that the inverse of the number of colours of the gauge group @xmath26 could be taken as a perturbative expansion parameter .",
    "indeed large-@xmath27 qcd shows features that resemble , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the @xmath28 case .",
    "relevant consequences of this approach are that meson dynamics in the large-@xmath27 limit is described by the tree diagrams of an effective local lagrangian ; moreover , at the leading order , one has to include the contributions of the infinite number of zero - width resonances that constitute the spectrum of the theory .",
    "both assertions can be merged by constructing a lagrangian theory in terms of @xmath1 ( pseudogoldstone mesons ) and @xmath29 ( heavier resonances ) flavour multiplets as active degrees of freedom .",
    "this has systematically been established @xcite and sets forth the following features  : + i ) the construction of the operators is guided by chiral symmetry for the lightest pseudoscalar mesons and by unitary symmetry for the resonances .",
    "typically , @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates a resonance field and @xmath32 is a chiral structured tensor , involving the goldstone bosons , with a chiral counting represented by the power of the momenta .",
    "then chiral symmetry is preserved upon integration of the resonance states and the low - energy expansion of the amplitudes show the appropriate behaviour .",
    "+ ii ) as in @xmath2 , symmetries do not provide information on the weights of the operators , i.e. on their coupling constants . the latter only incorporate information from higher energies and , in principle , are completely unknown . however if we want to disguise our theory with the role of mediator between the chiral and the parton regimes it is clear that the amplitudes or form factors arising from our lagrangian have to match the asymptotic behaviour driven by qcd .",
    "a heuristic strategy , well supported at the phenomenological level @xcite , resides in matching the ope of green functions ( that are order parameters of chiral symmetry ) with the corresponding expressions evaluated within the theory .",
    "this procedure provides a determination for some of the coupling constants of the lagrangian .",
    "in addition the asymptotic behaviour of form factors of qcd currents is estimated from the spectral structure of two - point functions @xcite or the partonic make - up @xcite .",
    "+ iii ) the theory that we have devised , known as resonance chiral theory ( @xmath33 ) , lacks an expansion parameter .",
    "there is of course the guide given by @xmath34 that translates into a loop expansion .",
    "however there is no counting that limits the number of operators with resonances that have to be included in the initial lagrangian .",
    "this non - perturbative character of @xmath33 , that may take back the perturbative practitioner , has to be understood properly .",
    "on one side the number of resonance fields relies fundamentally in the physical system of interest , on the other , the maximum order of the chiral tensor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operator ] ) is very much constrained by the enforced high - energy behaviour , as explained in ii ) before",
    ". customarily higher powers of momenta lean to spoil the asymptotic conduct that qcd demands @xcite .",
    "therefore there is a well defined methodology to deal with @xmath33 . + as commented above large-@xmath27 requires , already at @xmath35 , an infinite spectrum in order to match the leading qcd logarithms . at present",
    "@xmath33 only includes one multiplet of resonances for the different quantum numbers  : scalars , pseudoscalars , vectors and axial - vectors .",
    "it is not known how to include an infinite number of states in a model - independent way and this simplification can produce inconsistencies in the matching procedure described above @xcite . in principle a way out of these lean on the inclusion of more states that may delay the appearance of that problem . from a phenomenological point of view , though , the first multiplets drive the relevant dynamics in the systems of interest , as hadronic tau decays , and are clearly enough . however there is no conceptual problem that prevents the addition of more spectra ( in a finite number ) if needed .",
    "the hadronic decays of the tau lepton happen in an energy region where resonances do indeed resonate .",
    "therefore the leading large-@xmath27 prescription of zero - width resonances does not allow to perform a phenomenological study of the decays .",
    "the introduction of finite widths , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ks],[eq : gs ] ) , should be done through the same tools used to handle the amplitudes . for narrow resonances , like most of those with @xmath36 in the energy region spanned by tau decays , it is a good approximation to consider constant widths that can be taken from the phenomenology at hand or fitted from data .",
    "wider resonances , though , have a non - trivial off - shell structure that has to be taken into account .    the off - shell width of the @xmath21 has been studied thoroughly and it is dominated by the @xmath37 contribution . in the gks parameterisations the imaginary part of the mass in the pole reads @xcite  : _ ( s ) = _ ( m_^2 ) ( s-4m_^2 ) , [ eq : wgs ] where @xmath38 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was seen that this width can be evaluated within @xmath33 through a dyson - schwinger like resummation controlled by the short - distance behaviour required by qcd on the correlator of two vector currents .",
    "the result for the imaginary part of the pole is  : m _ _ ( s ) = ^3(s ) ( s-4m_^2 ) , [ eq : wus ] were @xmath39 is the vector resonance mass and @xmath40 the decay constant of the pion , both of them in the chiral limit .",
    "it is worth to notice that the dependence on the @xmath41 variable of both imaginary parts in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wgs],[eq : wus ] ) is the same .",
    "however the prescription given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wus ] ) already accounts for the on - shell width while in the gks model it is a free parameter to be fitted .",
    "the off - shell width of @xmath42 follows from that on @xmath21 .",
    "however in ref .  @xcite it was concluded that it requires a slight modification  : @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the kaon momentum in the rest frame of the hadronic system , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a blatt - weisskopf barrier factor with @xmath48 the interaction radius .",
    "we find @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite , when the @xmath51 contribution to the width in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gkss ] ) is also included .",
    "the hadronic off - shell widths for other resonances like @xmath52 or @xmath53 , that are also relevant in the decays of the tau lepton , are not so well known . in principle",
    "the methodology put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite could also be applied but it is necessary to know better the perturbative loop expansion of @xmath33 in order to proceed .",
    "therefore one has to resort to appropriate modelizations being the key point the leading behaviour of the off - shell structure in the @xmath41 variable .",
    "hence it is customary to propose parameterised widths of which the simplest version reads as  : _",
    "r(s ) = _ r(m_r^2 ) ( ) ^ ( s - s_th ) , [ eq : wa1 ] where the @xmath54 function is related with the available phase - space that corresponds to the threshold given by @xmath55 . the @xmath56 parameter can be given by models or fitted to experimental data .",

    "the real issue is that , as we have indicated , the gks model is not consistent with qcd and the cleo reshaping is of not much use .",
    "previous theoretical studies of these channels have only been done within parameterisations in the line of the gks model @xcite .",
    "recently we have employed the same technique than in the three pion case to study these channels @xcite .",
    "the main novelty has been to handle the vector form factor through the construction of the relevant lagrangian for the odd - intrinsic - parity sector , obtaining constraints on the new coupling constants through the requirement of the appropriate asymptotic behaviour of the vector form factor and also with some request to the phenomenology .",
    "our analysis emphasizes the discrepancy between different approaches in the weight of vector and axial - vector contribution to the decay width as can be seen in table 1 .",

    "hadronic decays of the tau lepton provide all - important information on the hadronization of currents in order to yield relevant knowledge on non - perturbative features of low - energy quantum chromodynamics . in order to achieve this goal we need to input more controlled qcd - based modelizations .",
    "our target is not only to fit the data at whatever cost , but do it with a reasonable parameterisation that allows us to understand more about the theoretical description of nature .",
    "the effective theory based phenomenological lagrangian approach seems , along this line , more promising than the breit - wigner parameterisations .",
    "the procedure relies in a field theory construction that embodies , up to a supposedly minor modelization of the large-@xmath27 behaviour , the relevant features of qcd in the resonance energy region , giving an appropriate account of the main traits of the experimental data and showing that it is a compelling framework to work with .",
