    "this latter process is of particular interest for its possible relation to the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition@xcite .",
    "the formation of the residue and reaching an equilibrium , however , are preceded by a fast cascade and pre - equilibrium processes when energetic nucleons and light clusters are emitted , impacting the equilibration time , density and excitation energy of the hot residue .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate the energy - dissipation process that leads to the formation of highly - excited , thermal - like residues in reactions of 6.2 - 14.6 gev / c protons with @xmath0au nuclei , and to highlight the importance of in - medium cross - sections and momentum - dependent potentials for the process .",
    "the importance of the momentum dependence @xcite for heavy - ion reactions has been demonstrated in the past by zhang , das gupta and gale @xcite , and by pan and danielewicz @xcite , who have shown that the features of measured collective flow in the reactions could only be reproduced , in transport simulations , if a momentum - dependent potential was assumed for nucleons , in combination with a low nuclear incompressibility .",

    "mean - fields , together with collisions , determine how the residue density relaxes .",
    "the coalescence of nucleons into composite particles during randomization influences the energy dissipation , thereby affecting the excitation energy ending up in the formed thermal - like residue .",
    "a unique feature of our analysis is the ability to correlate light - charged particle emission with the measured excitation energy of the hot nucleus . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown for this data set that the increase in excitation energy , measured by calorimetry , is correlated with increased charge and mass loss in the early stage of a reaction .",

    "we rely on the boltzmann - equation model ( bem ) @xcite , that contains appropriate cross - section parameterizations for the high - energy regime , has a flexibility with regard to the choice of mean - fields importance in residue formation and describes the production of light composite particles , @xmath4h , @xmath5h and @xmath5he .",

    "the relaxation of the structure was linked to the multifragmentation of the system . however , at the time , the parameterization of high - energy processes largely represented an extrapolation of those appropriate for low energies and the mean - fields had just a density dependence .",
    "the impact of cluster formation on residue formation was not studied .",
    "now , the transport code with more physical features is employed in the same energy regime to verify if it can reproduce observables related to the process of energy dissipation . in particular , we are interested in the composite - particle production , prior to equilibrium , and in the excited - source properties .",

    "the experimentally measured charged - particle spectra were separated into two parts : the fast and the thermal - like components  @xcite .",
    "the thermal - like source was reconstructed by subtracting all first - stage `` fast '' particles ( e@xmath47 30mev for z=1 and e@xmath47 ( 9z+40 ) mev for z @xmath482 ) from the target charge and mass , as described in ref .  @xcite .",

    ", we may note that in - medium cross - sections reduce the energy deposition in the target .",
    "this is because , for lowered cross - sections , the medium becomes more transparent to the energetic cascade initiated by the projectile .",
    "further , we may note in the figure that a momentum - dependent potential enhances the energy deposition .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the momentum dependence enhances the speed of particles in the medium , increasing the collision rate . in combination of the effects , out of the first four cases of calculations , the energy deposition is strongest for the ( @xmath55 ) case and weakest for ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "as far as the overall magnitude is concerned , however , the energy deposition is quite similar in the four cases . when we suppress the composite particle production ,",
    "per given mass loss , the system cools off faster .",
    "this is because nucleons , at a given system temperature , carry off more kinetic energy per unit mass than do composite particles .",
    "the faster cooling also results in a lower entropy for the source than in the nucleon - only case .",
    "notably , at a general level , one expects a higher entropy generation when the composite production is included , since more degrees of freedom become available to the system .",
    "figure [ number150 ] shows next the cumulative numbers of different emitted preequilibrium particles , as a function of time , at @xmath59 fm .",
    "we employed for the figure a somewhat arbitrary cut in the kinetic energy , at @xmath60=150 mev , in order to distinguish the pre - equilibrium @xmath61 mev ) from prompt particles ( @xmath62 mev ) . at later times in fig .",
    "[ number150 ] , we can see that the emission of the preequilibrium particles is enhanced when the free cross - sections are used .",
    "otherwise , up to @xmath63 fm / c the emission is rather independent of the cross - sections .",
    "this is because the particles which come out first are fast and stem from high - energy processes taking place at low cross - sections , little modified by the medium .",
    "the momentum - dependence of the mean - field speeds up the passage of particles through the medium . on one hand",
    ", this dependence enhances early particle emission , as apparent in the figure . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum dependence somewhat increases the production of composite particles in general .",
    "specifically , the production requires several particles present within the same location and , thus , it is enhanced at higher densities in a reaction .",
    "higher speeds of energetic nucleons , relative to the medium , permit for more production of the composites , before the overall medium density decreases . in comparing the temporal evolution of the emission of different particles relative to each other in fig .",
    "[ number150 ] , we can see that the times when these emissions become significant are different for different particles , with the emission of protons setting in at @xmath64 fm / c , and the emission of deuterons and tritons setting in , respectively , at @xmath65 and @xmath66 fm / c .",
    "these differences can be understood in terms of the difference in speed of the different particles , at comparable energies or momenta , particularly with the composites needing to move out from the higher - density interior of the source .",
    "figure [ ekmeanpre ] shows next the mean kinetic energy of protons , with @xmath61  mev , as a function of the proton emission time , at different impact parameters .",
    "the particular results refer to the ( @xmath57 ) case of the calculations . at short times , when the emission rates are low , the averages fluctuate .",
    "if we adopt an energy cut - off of 30  mev @xcite , to separate the non - equilibrium from equilibrium emission , we arrive at thermalization times @xmath67  fm / c .",
    "the thermalization times interestingly appear to be nearly independent of the impact parameter .",
    "for the reaction p+@xmath0au , isotope - resolved experimental data on the light charged particles exist @xcite for four incident momenta of 6.2 , 10.2 , 10.8 and 14.6 gev / c .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the data from this simple p+a reaction , to the transport - model predictions on the early - stage cluster formation .",
    "the light charged particle ratios , d / p , t / p and @xmath68he / p , from the ( @xmath57 ) simulations of the 14.6 gev / c reaction , are compared in fig .",
    "[ ratio14im ] to the data , as a function of the excitation energy and at different times in the reaction , both before and after an application of the filter simulating the effects of experimental setup and procedures .",
    "the unfiltered ratios are shown in the left - hand and the filtered in the right - hand panels .",
    "the theoretical excitation energies represent averages for specific impact parameters .",
    "the filter is based on the geometrical arrangement of detectors and on the kinetic energy acceptance for non - thermal charged particles . specifically , to simulate the experimental selection of the particles emitted before thermalization",
    ", the energy acceptance ranges from 30 mev for z=1 and 58 mev for z=2 up to the upper detection limit of the detectors ( e@xmath69@xmath70350mev for p , e@xmath69@xmath70136mev for d and e@xmath69@xmath70162mev for t ) .",
    "the main effect of the geometrical part of the filter is to eliminate the unmeasured forward - focused ( below 14 degrees ) energetic `` prompt '' protons emitted early in the collision .",
    "the energy cuts eliminate very high energy protons , but also slow particles that tend to be emitted later in the simulations ( after 40 - 45 fm / c ) .",
    "the comparison between the theory and data is done for the energetic , dynamical , rather than thermal , particles .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ratio14im ] , the filtered - particle ratios generally stabilize past 50 fm / c .",
    "if we make a comparison at 65 fm / c , we find a semiquantitative agreement between the theory and data for the t / p and d / p ratios and a bit poorer agreement for the @xmath68he / p ratios .",
    "the @xmath68he / p ratios remain below the data no matter what later times in the simulations are used for the comparison .",
    "overall , we find that the experimental ratios of z=1 isotopes as a function of excitation energy can be reproduced , with some success , at late times in the filtered transport - simulations .",
    "the experimentally reconstructed average source charge @xmath71 and the mass loss @xmath72 for the source are next represented in fig .",
    "[ zvse ] , as a function of the reconstructed excitation energy , for the 6.2 gev / c ( left panels ) and 14.6 gev / c ( right panels ) reactions .",

    "the results from measurements are the theoretical results for the source , stemming from the ( @xmath57 ) simulations , at the different times @xmath73 in a reaction . the results for @xmath74  fm / c agree reasonably well with those obtained from data when following the relation of sec .",
    "figures [ compz ] and [ comprat ] show next , for the p+au reaction at 14.6 gev / c , similar comparisons to those in figs .",
    "[ zvse ] and [ ratio14im ] , but now confronting the different assumptions on nucleon - nucleon cross - sections and mean - field potentials .",
    "we observe , as in the context of fig .",
    "[ evolcomp ] , that the effect of the momentum - dependence in the mean - field is to allow the source to reach higher excitation energy ( by @xmath75150 - 200 mev ) , better conforming with data . as to in - medium cross - sections , we find in fig .",
    "[ zvse ] that they have little impact on the relations between the charge and mass of the source and the excitation energy . on the other hand ,",
    "only the in - medium cross - sections allow the simulations to reproduce the particle ratios consistently with also reproducing the source characteristics .",
    "overall the best agreement of simulations with data , for a late time in a reaction , is reached for the ( @xmath57 ) version of the simulations .    if the thermalization time is defined as that time for which the simulation best reproduces the experimentally reconstructed source , perceived to be the basis of thermal emission , then the time , judging from the ( @xmath57 ) results in figs .",
    "[ ratio14im]-[comprat ] , is close to 65 fm / c , both at 6.2 and at 14.6 gev / c .",
    "this time is somewhat higher than that first deduced on the basis of fig .",
    "[ ekmeanpre ] ( @xmath76  fm / c ) but the former time principally represents a lower bound on the thermalization . obviously , one also needs to remember that , in general , no perfect match can be reached between conclusions reached in the experiment from spectra and in the simulations from a temporal progress .",
    "overall , in the simulations we see that the bulk of the energy deposition process ( associated with a saturation of the entropy ) is over after about 25 fm / c ( see fig .  [ evolcomp ] ) .",
    "this leaves @xmath63 fm / c for redistributing the energy across the nucleus , i.e.  to thermalize . in detail , however , some emissions might take place early , on which , could be classified as thermal on the basis of spectra ; conversely some emissions might take place later that could be classified as first - stage spectra .",
    "the effect of light composite emission on the relation between different source characteristics at different times is next explored in fig .",
    "[ zvsenc ] , which shows the source charge ( z@xmath77 ) and the mass loss ( @xmath78 ) as functions of e * , for buu without the production of light clusters at 14.6 gev / c .",
    "it is seen that the deduced thermalization time would have been earlier than for the dynamics with light - particle , with best agreement with data achieved at @xmath79  fm / c . however , the maximal excitation energies of @xmath80 mev turn out to be well below that observed experimentally compared to the simulations with clusters , which extends to @xmath81 mev .    in comparing to data",
    ", it may be interesting to construct a distribution of the excitation energies for the simulations .",
    "the simulations , equally spaced in the impact parameter , are weighted with the factor @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the upper and lower ends of the @xmath23-interval that the simulation represents . furthermore , for each impact parameter , we assume the @xmath41-distribution to be of a gaussian form , with an assumed value for the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . figure [ disring ] next compares the constructed distributions , for different versions of the simulations and different fwhm , to the distributions from 14.6 gev / c data .",
    "the distributions are normalized at @xmath85  mev .",
    "the left - hand panels display distributions constructed with a fwhm of 250 mev and the right - hand panels - with a fwhm of 400 mev .",
    "the higher value of fwhm is favored by comparisons and the ( @xmath55 ) simulations yield predictions inferior to other simulations .",
    "overall , we find that the comparison between data and calculations favors the ( @xmath57 ) version of the simulations and suggests the thermalization time of the order of 65 fm / c at both incident momenta .",
    "the predicted evolutions of the average excitation energy and of the average density of the source formed in 14.6 gev / c p+@xmath86au reactions at different impact parameters , from ( @xmath57 ) transport calculations , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ e_rho_time ] . at all impact parameters @xmath23 , the deposited energy increases strongly during the first few fm / c , as the projectile crosses more of the target .",
    "the excitation energy reaches a maximum when the projectile leaves the target .",
    "the respective times for the maxima then change with the impact parameter , from 18 fm / c for the most central collisions to 10 - 12 fm / c for more peripheral . with",
    "the maximum reached earlier in the peripheral collisions , for the shorter proton trajectories inside the target , the energy deposition is lower in the peripheral collisions .    the average source density in fig .",
    "[ e_rho_time ] appears nearly constant during the first 10 fm / c of the collision , independent of the impact parameter .",
    "however , this density decreases rapidly thereafter as the energy dissipation increases and more  prompt \" nucleons get ejected .",
    "the nucleon knock - out process , the so - called `` swiss - cheese '' effect , appears actually to be the driving factor in depleting the nuclear density .",
    "the progress of that process depends on the impact parameter and its effects mimic those of an expansion . to illustrate the process , fig .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we do not quite see a cavitation in this reaction , but , nonetheless , we can see quite clearly a local depletion of density along the trajectory of the projectile , as prompt nucleons are ejected on a very short time scale .",
    "the depletion becomes particularly obvious at around 20 fm / c right after the deposited energy maximizes , as further exhibited in fig .",
    "it is not until 20 - 30 fm / c later that the system relaxes and that the nuclear density smoothes out .",
    "it is also after the first 20 fm / c that the most significant mass loss occurs , through prompt emission processes , cf .  the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ evol ] .",
    "figure  [ evol ] generally explores the effect of entrance channel beam momentum on the source evolution , displaying the excitation energy , average density , entropy per nucleon and mass as a function of time , for the @xmath59  fm p+au reactions at 6.2 , 10.2 , 12.8 and 14.6 gev / c .",
    "it is seen that the deposition of energy , the generated entropy per nucleon and the mass loss for the source increase with the beam momentum , while the mean density decreases .",
    "after 15 - 20 fm / c , the average density of the system decreases rapidly to reach 1/3 to 1/4 of the normal density by 40 fm / c , after which the entropy per nucleon becomes relatively stable for all systems .",
    "it is at that point that the chaotic regime appears to be established and the deposited energy can be attributed to the thermal source .    increasing mass loss , due to an ejection of prompt nucleons and then the preequilibrium emission , with increase of the incident momentum , is consistent with what has been observed experimentally @xcite . with increase in the excitation energy and",
    "the number of collisions and produced light fragments , the entropy per nucleon increases with the incident momentum . at any momentum ,",
    "the entropy per nucleon stabilizes at about the same time as thermalization , which also coincides with a decrease in nuclear density . on one hand , when the system is close to thermalization , the gains in entropy during evolution become generally moderate . on the other hand ,",
    "when density drops , the collision rate decreases and entropy generation slows down . because of evaporation , in fact , the entropy per nucleon of the source itself may begin to drop .",
    "it may be further of interest to explore the evolution of different isotope ratios with time .",
    "figure  [ ratiotime ] shows the unfiltered ratios of d / p , t / p , t/@xmath5he and @xmath5he / p , as a function of time , from the ( @xmath57 ) simulations at 14.6 gev / c and different impact parameters . for all ratios relative to protons , there is a common ordering : the smaller the impact parameter , the higher the ratio .",
    "this can be linked to larger nucleon yields , emitted over a shorter time in the more central reactions . to form a cluster ,",
    "several nucleons need to move simultaneously out of the system .",
    "the t/@xmath5he ratio , lower in more central than in peripheral collisions is possibly due to larger neutron relative to proton loss in central collisions , driving the system towards symmetry , cf .",
    "[ compz ] .    finally , for the optimal thermalization times , when experimental relations between the source charge and mass and excitation energy are reproduced , we examine the thermalized source characteristics at the different incident momenta .",

    "each point in the construction of the plots corresponds to a specific impact parameter , between 0.4 fm to 8.0 fm , for a given incident momentum .",
    "it is apparent that for each of the incident momenta , the density and entropy have a fairly smooth dependence on the excitation energy .",
    "though , at a given excitation energy , there is a small decrease in the average density and a slight increase in the entropy per nucleon with a rise in the incident momentum , primarily the dependencies on the excitation energy are fairly universal with the momentum .",
    "there is some increase in the range of excitation energy between 6 and 10 gev / c and less afterwards .",
    "notably , at the excitation energy of 1000 mev ( corresponding to 5 - 6 mev / nucleon ) , the source becomes quite dilute , reaching densities between 1/4 and 1/3 of normal density .",
    "the system becomes even more dilute at higher excitation .",
    "proton - induced reactions provide a baseline comparison for any models constructed to explain the a+a reactions . in this paper , we have confronted a comprehensive data set for the p+@xmath87au reaction between 6.2 gev / c and 14.6 gev / c with a transport model including light - cluster production .",
    "we have concentrated on the characteristics of the thermal source in the reactions , its mass , charge and excitation energy , and on the normalized yields for pre - equilibrium lcps .",
    "we found that the cluster formation within the model , during the pre - equilibrium stage , enhances the source excitation energy compared to the situation without clusters .",
    "judging from the entropy , the majority of dissipation leading to the formation of a thermalized source takes place over the first 25 - 30 fm / c of a reaction .",
    "however , an additional 35 - 45 fm / c is required for the pre - equilibrium particles to leave the source and for the source to acquire characteristics that can be identified experimentally for the thermal emission .    filtered yields for pre - equilibrium lcps have been analyzed as a function of excitation energy .",
    "we found that the use of in - medium scattering cross - sections and momentum - dependent potentials considerably improved the agreement with data , compared to earlier , more simplified versions of the calculations .",
    "nonetheless , we could not obtain a simultaneous complete agreement with the measured @xmath68he yield .",
    "if the model was extended to the alpha particles , it would be certainly interesting to look in the future at the pre - equilibrium emission of alphas and the effect of that emission on energy dissipation .",
    "it is entirely possible that the production of alphas impacts the production of @xmath68he .",
    "an optimal characteristic time of @xmath1  fm / c was extracted for the p+@xmath0au reactions , for an agreement between the measured and calculated source characteristics and pre - equilibrium particle - ratios . the optimal time was found to be approximately independent of the impact parameter and of the incident momentum .",
    "the transport model predicts highly excited sources , with excitation energies up to 5 - 6  amev , at low densities , down to 1/4 - 1/3 of normal density , i.e.  close to the typical multifragmentation conditions .",
    "the target nuclei undergo a density depletion from early on in the reaction , as nucleons and light clusters are ejected along the projectile trajectory .",
    "the ejection itself reduces the density , which is followed by a readjustment in the target density and momentum distributions . we do not , however , observe the development of a spherical cavity , nor development of strong compression waves .",
    "rather , the system arrives at the thermalized state at @xmath88  fm / c , at densities close to the critical density , in the course of a gradual healing of the cheese - effect due to the prompt cascade , involving the pre - equilibrium particle emission .",
    "the features of the system then lend support to the analysis methods of nuclear fragmentation relying on the concepts of equilibrium within the phase transition region as applied to the isis data  @xcite .",
