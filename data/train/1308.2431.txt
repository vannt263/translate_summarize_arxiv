    "quantum information with gaussian states of continuous variable systems has been investigated thoroughly and with startling success both theoretically and experimentally ( for comprehensive reviews of different aspects see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", there has been growing awareness of some important limitations intrinsic to working entirely within the framework of gaussian states and/or gaussian operations , so that at some point it becomes both desirable and necessary to start exploring the vast ocean of continuous - variable non - gaussian states and non - gaussian operations .",
    "the first pioneering and paradigmatic example of this need is given by the by now classic proof that distillation of gaussian entangled states resorting only to gaussian operations is impossible  @xcite .",
    "in fact , various compelling reasons suggest a thorough investigation of the properties of continuous - variable non - gaussian states .",
    "gaussian states are indeed extremal in the sense that at fixed covariance matrix several nonclassical properties such as entanglement , when measured by the entanglement of formation , and distillable secret key rates are minimized by gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "specific families of non - gaussian entangled resources lead to significant improvements in the performance of existing continuous - variable quantum information protocols such as teleportation  @xcite .",
    "measurement - based quantum computation with continuous variables eventually needs both non - gaussian operations and non - gaussian resource states in order to be universal  @xcite .",
    "preliminary investigations of the interplay of non - gaussian inputs and different types of gaussian and non - gaussian channels unveils the clear advantages , in general , of non - gaussianity for state estimation and metrology  @xcite .",
    "stronger violations of bell inequalities and better performing entanglement swapping protocols are also expected using non - gaussian resources and strategies beyond the currently available ones  @xcite .",
    "while so - called gaussifier protocols of entanglement distillation have been proposed that convert noisy non - gaussian states into gaussian ones through converging iterative procedures  @xcite , general optimal strategies for the distillation of highly entangled non - gaussian states are still lacking . finally , the interplay of non - gaussianity , non - classicality , and non - markovianity is expected to lead to further new phenomena when addressing the dynamics of open continuous - variable systems .    among the many families of continuous - variable non - gaussian states that can be of interest for fundamental quantum physics as well as for quantum information and related quantum technologies one should mention squeezed cat states  @xcite ; multiphoton squeezed states , that is states that generalize the usual two - photon gaussian squeezed states by considering nonlinear extensions of the linear bogoliubov squeezing transformations , either single - mode  @xcite or two - mode  @xcite ; and especially squeezed bell states  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the latter include squeezed fock and de - gaussified squeezed coherent states as particular cases , as we shall review below .",
    "non - gaussian and de - gaussified states can be generated either by introducing higher - order nonlinearities in the source , and/or by performing conditional measurements .",
    "many theoretical and experimental efforts have been concentrated on the engineering of nonclassical , non - gaussian states of the radiation field  @xcite . in particular , concerning quantum teleportation with continuous variables  @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be improved using various families of non - gaussian resources  @xcite . at present , the best experimentally realized non - gaussian resource for continuous - variable teleportation is the photon - subtracted squeezed state  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as already mentioned , a new class of continuous - variable non - gaussian states , the squeezed bell states , has been introduced recently  @xcite .",
    "these states interpolate between different de - gaussified states , and can be fine tuned by acting on an independent free parameter in addition to the squeezing .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", entangled gaussian and de - gaussified states are defined by applying squeezing and ladder operators on the two - mode vacuum . within this theoretical context the teleportation fidelity for the braunstein - kimble - vaidman protocol is improved , in a significant range of the parameters , by replacing gaussian and de - gaussified resources by optimized squeezed bell states  @xcite .",
    "this has been verified for different inputs ( including coherent states , squeezed states , and squeezed number states ) , also in the presence of losses and other realistic sources of imperfections  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be understood by remarking a crucial difference existing between the case of teleportation protocols relying on entangled gaussian resources and the case allowing for more general entangled states . in the former",
    "it is known that the fidelity of teleportation and the entanglement of the shared entangled gaussian resource are in one - to - one correspondence  @xcite . in the latter",
    "this is no longer true and the fidelity of teleportation becomes a highly complicated function of three ( in general conflicting ) variables : degree of entanglement , degree of non - gaussianity , and degree of gaussian affinity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the third variable ( gaussian affinity ) is crucial .",
    "it quantifies the overlap with the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "loosely speaking , it assures that an efficient entangled resource must contain a contribution , with a relevant weight , given by the two - mode squeezed vacuum plus symmetric non gaussian corrections .",
    "the optimized squeezed bell states realize indeed the best possible compromise for the simultaneous maximization over all these three properties of the fidelity of teleportation  @xcite .    going beyond these preliminary theoretical results",
    ", the desired goal would be to construct experimental platforms capable of generating classes of highly tunable non - gaussian resources with enhanced performances for protocols of quantum technology based on continuous variables . in order to proceed towards concrete experimental realizations",
    ", one needs to introduce a basic scheme of generation that takes into account all the relevant sources of noise and imperfections in realistic instances .",
    "thereafter , one must verify that in these realistic scenarios the performance of the new resource in the framework of a given quantum protocol provides an appreciable advancement that justifies the experimental effort .",
    "after this preliminary analysis , one needs to work out carefully the details of the experimental setup and , finally , one needs to provide reliable methods for the reconstruction of the experimentally generated states .    in the present work we introduce the basic scheme of generation for a large class of tunable two - mode entangled non - gaussian states and we present a preliminary analysis on their performance as resources for continuous - variable quantum technologies . the experimental scheme that we are going to introduce",
    "has the advantage of being flexible and versatile , in the sense that a variation of the freely adjustable experimental parameters allows for the generation of different non - gaussian states including , besides the squeezed bell states , photon - added squeezed states  @xcite , photon - subtracted squeezed states  @xcite , squeezed number states and , obviously , also gaussian twin beams  @xcite .",
    "the relative performance of different states will will be investigated in detail for the protocol of quantum teleportation of unknown coherent states  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the optimized states in realistic conditions provide , in a significant range of physical parameters , a superior performance compared to all existing de - gaussified states .",

    "a more general form of the squeezed bell states could include a relative phase , but this inclusion would not improve the performance of the squeeze bell states when considered as entangled resources . at some suitably chosen values of the @xmath4 parameter ,",
