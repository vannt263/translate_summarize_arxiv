    "quantum correlations among parts of a multicomponent ( multipartite ) composite quantum systems are usually described and investigated employing tools of multilinear algebra .",
    "this seems to be a natural method since at the most elementary level pure nonentangled states are simple tensors in the tensor product of hilbert spaces of subsystems of an @xmath0-partite system , @xmath1 whereas various degrees of entanglement can be characterized by quantifying ( in some precisely defined sense ) the `` departure '' of a state from the simple tensor structure .    behind these algebraic definitions",
    "one finds interesting geometry . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we showed how some methods of symplectic geometry can be used to describe and quantify entanglement .",
    "two basic observations are crucial . from a physical point of view entanglement properties remain unchanged under the action of `` local '' unitary group @xmath2 which reflects the physically obvious statement that entanglement can not be changed by non - dissipative quantum operations confined to subsystems .",
    "it follows thus that a classification and description of orbits of @xmath3 in the space of states ( which , as quantum mechanics demands , is not @xmath4 itself , but rather its projectivization @xmath5 ) leads to a classification of various degrees of entanglement .",
    "the second ingredient of this approach is an observation that both the space of states @xmath5 and the dual of the lie algebra @xmath6 of @xmath3 possesses natural poisson structures intertwined by the @xmath3-equivariant moment map @xmath7 which sends @xmath3-orbits in @xmath5 onto coadjoint orbits .",
    "coadjoint orbits are in fact symplectic manifolds but since the moment map is not diffeomorphic the symplectic form on @xmath5 is , in general , degenerate on @xmath3-orbits .",
    "it is not the case only for the unique orbit of non - entangled states and the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form on an orbit can be used as a measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the moment map can be used as a tool for a partial classification of @xmath3-orbits in @xmath5 since it maps them onto coadjoint orbits which can be easily classified by their intersections with the dual to the cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra @xmath8 of @xmath3 .",
    "such a classification would give an effective answer to the problem of the `` local unitary equivalence of states ''",
    "( see @xcite ) , i.e.  whether two states can be mutually connected by non - dissipative quantum operations restricted to subsystems . the problem , important from the experimental point of view when the possibility of obtaining requested states from those which are available , translates thus into deciding if two states belong to the same @xmath3-orbit .",
    "obviously , since the moment map is not a diffeomorphism one does not obtain a satisfactory classification of @xmath3-orbits in @xmath5 by mapping them into coadjoint ones .",
    "it may happen that many ( in fact a continuous family of ) orbits are mapped onto a single coadjoint orbit .",
    "hence , for a full characterization a deeper insight into the structure of fibers of the moment map is needed .",
    "we will show how to do it for @xmath9 .",
    "we will also show on examples how the structure of fibers and , consequently , classification of orbits become more complicated for systems with more parts .",
    "the above outlined formulation of the problem allows for generalizations to cases when the underlying hilbert space @xmath4 does not have a structure of the full tensor product , but eg .",
    ", is its symmetric , @xmath10 , or antisymmetric , @xmath11 , part as in the cases of two indistinguishable particles ( bosons and fermions ) .",
    "since all three cases bear significant similarities we will consider them in parallel whenever possible .",
    "our results are stated precisely in the last section of the paper . for those readers most interested in the qualitative aspects of these results we state them here without technical details of proofs .",
    "the goal of our work is to give an exact description of the partial symplectic structure of all @xmath3-orbits in @xmath12 and @xmath9 . to do this",
    "we first observe that it follows from brion s theorem @xcite that the moment map @xmath13 parameterizes the @xmath3-orbits in @xmath14 in the sense that it maps the set of @xmath3-orbits in @xmath14 bijectively onto the set of @xmath3-orbits in its image .",
    "it is well - known that , modulo the action of the weyl - group , this image is @xmath15 where @xmath16 a convex region in @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the lie algebra of diagonal matrices in @xmath19 and @xmath17 is embedded in @xmath8 via the invariant form @xmath20 .",
    "in fact @xmath16 intersects each orbit of @xmath3 in an orbit of the weyl group so that , modulo the weyl group , @xmath16 parameterizes the orbits .",
    "we give an exact description of @xmath16 as a certain probability polyhedron .",
    "we also determine a real algebraic set @xmath21 in @xmath14 , defined by linear algebraic equations and inequalities , which parameterizes the @xmath3-orbits in @xmath14 and which is mapped onto a fundamental region of the weyl - group in @xmath16 by the moment map .",
    "every element @xmath22 of @xmath21 determines in a simple way a vector @xmath23 of positive integers which completely determines the moment map image @xmath24 as a flag manifold @xmath25 .",
    "we also exactly describe the fiber @xmath26 of the moment map .",
    "it is the fiber of the homogeneous fibration @xmath27 which in fact ( up to very simple finite - coverings ) is a product of certain symmetric spaces . in the case of bosons",
    "it is the product of a torus and a number ( depending on @xmath28 and the degeneracy ) of symmetric spaces of the form @xmath29 .",
    "the case of fermions is analogous , except that the symmetric spaces are of the form @xmath30 .    to make the paper reasonably concise and , simultaneously , accessible to readers not familiar with the whole needed background material we provide in appendix comprehensive outline of the most important results concerning spherical varieties . on the other hand we decided that the main text of the paper should remain self - contained hence the needed definitions and statements , even if they concern the background material ,",

    "a fundamental region of the weyl group is given by the image @xmath474 where the elements of @xmath475 are of the form @xmath476 where @xmath477 for all @xmath429 and @xmath478 and @xmath479 denotes the dimension of the subspace where @xmath53 has eigenvalue @xmath426 , @xmath480 and @xmath481 .",
    "to complete our analysis of this situation we must describe in detail the fibration @xmath417}\\to k / k_{\\mu([v])}$ ] .",
    "let us begin by computing the @xmath3-isotropy group at a generic point @xmath482 , i.e. , where @xmath483 .",

    "the fiber is the product of the group manifolds @xmath493 .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that just as in the previous two cases these fibers are symmetric spaces .",
    "we presented the exact description of the partial symplectic structure of all @xmath3-orbits in @xmath12 for two bosons , fermions and distinguishable particles . to do this",
    "we first noticed that in all cases @xmath14 is in fact a spherical variety , i.e. , it is the closure of an open dense orbit of the borel group .",
    "this observation turns out to be very fruitful .",
    "namely , by brion s theorem ( @xcite ) it implies that the moment map @xmath13 parameterizes all @xmath3-orbits in @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath7 maps the set of @xmath3-orbits in @xmath14 bijectively onto the set of @xmath3-orbits in its image .",
    "we gave the exact description of the fibers @xmath26 of the moment map .",
    "remarkably in all three cases these fibers ( up to very simple finite - coverings ) are products of certain symmetric spaces .",
    "we believe that the notion of spherical variety should play an important role also in case of multipartite systems .",
    "of course by simple dimensional arguments @xmath14 is typically not spherical in this case but it might happen that certain of @xmath287-orbits ( class of slocc states ) enjoy this property .",

    "semisimple complex lie groups such as the classical groups @xmath496 , @xmath497 and @xmath498 are the main examples which occur in our applications .",
    "typical choices for the maximal compact subgroups @xmath209 in the classical groups are @xmath499 , @xmath500 and @xmath501 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath42 can be holomorphically embedded in some @xmath502 so that @xmath209 is contained in @xmath503 .",
    "thus , @xmath504 is such that the operators in @xmath505 are anti - hermitian and those in @xmath506 are hermitian .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath505 is a _",
    "real form _ of @xmath494 in the sense that there there is an antilinear lie algebra involution @xmath507 with @xmath508 . in this case @xmath509 and @xmath510 .",
    "one often writes @xmath511 for the decomposition defined by @xmath512 .",
    "as was noted above , @xmath513 can be regarded as a subspace of the full space of hermitian matrices in @xmath514 so that @xmath515 is a diffeomorphism onto a space of positive - definite hermitian matrices .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 splits accordingly , i.e. @xmath516 is a product so that @xmath517 is diffeomorphic to some @xmath518 .",
    "since maximal compact subgroups of simple lie groups are in fact maximal and any two are conjugate , it follows that the set @xmath519 of maximal compact subgroups of @xmath42 can be identified with @xmath520 or equivalently with @xmath16 .",

    "let us consider this matter at the lie algebra level where we decompose @xmath526 into @xmath512 eigenspaces . since @xmath527 is complex linear and @xmath523 stabilizes @xmath528 , it is immediate that this splitting is @xmath529-invariant .",

    "in particular , since @xmath534 , it follows that the fixed subgroup @xmath3 is the complexification of the compact subgroup @xmath535 which is associated to the lie algebra @xmath536 .        it should be remarked that the quotient of a reductive complex lie group by any reductive complex subgroup @xmath49 can be realized as a closed @xmath42-orbit in an appropriately chosen representation space . in particular",
    ", @xmath94 has the structure of an affine variety .",

    "its fixed point algebra is denoted by @xmath539 with associated ( noncompact ) group @xmath540 .",
    "since @xmath523 commutes with @xmath541 , it stabilizes @xmath539 and yields a decomposition @xmath542 this decomposition is written as @xmath543 and the defining involution , which is the restriction of @xmath523 to @xmath539 , is called the _ cartan involution_. note that since @xmath544 consists of hermitian matrices , @xmath535 is a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath540 and @xmath545 is a symmetric space of noncompact type .",
    "the fact that the symmetric space @xmath537 is spherical follows immediately from the iwasawa decomposition of @xmath539 .",
