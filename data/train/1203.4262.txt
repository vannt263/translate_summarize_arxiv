    "ultracold gases in an optical lattice are promising as flexible quantum simulators for the study of quantum phases which are not easily accessible in condensed - matter physics  @xcite . experimental realization of the superfluid - to - mott transition has paved the way to studies of strongly interacting bose or fermi gases in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "recently , bose - bose mixtures of @xmath1rb and @xmath2k have been produced and loaded into an optical lattice @xcite , which provide a new playground for investigating the interplay between kinetic energy , interaction and the spin degree of freedom . in a further line of investigation",
    ", a bose - bose mixture of two hyperfine states of @xmath1rb has been used as a spin - gradient thermometer for measuring the temperature of ultracold gases in an optical lattice  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the effect of a second species on bosonic superfluidity in an optical lattice has been studied  @xcite . in these mixtures of different species or different hyperfine states , the most fundamental physics associated with quantum magnetism and the spin degree of freedom",
    "can be explored  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found that a three - body hard - core constraint can stabilize a system of single - component bosons with attractive two - body interactions in an optical lattice  @xcite , and numerical simulations have been performed to study properties of this system  @xcite . for two - component bosons with attractive inter - species interactions in an optical lattice , one interesting ground state is the pair - superfluid phase ( psf ) , which has been predicted and studied theoretically in several papers  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the psf can be viewed as a condensate of bosonic pairs of different species or hyperfine states due to a second - order hopping of the pairs , but with a strongly suppressed first - order tunneling of single atoms .",
    "for hard - core bosons with total filling @xmath0 , the psf for attractive interactions is equivalent to the xy - ferromagnetic phase ( or super - counter - fluid state , denoted as scf ) for repulsive interactions , i.e. the psf consists of particle - particle pairs of different species while the xy - ferromagnetic phase is composed of particle - hole pairs .",
    "it is apparent that the psf can only exist at very low temperature compared to the critical temperature of quantum magnetic phases .",
    "the latter are also governed by second - order tunneling processes , leading to an effective spin - exchange coupling  @xcite , which has already been observed for a double - well system  @xcite . at the current stage",
    ", it is experimentally challenging to reach the critical temperatures of quantum magnetic phases and the psf  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that these phases can be detected via momentum - space correlations observed in time - of - flight measurements  @xcite or by optical microscopy with single - site resolution  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the psf in a two- or three - dimensional optical lattice mostly focus on symmetric parameters for the two species ( for an exception in  @xcite ) , since this is the most favorable condition for the psf  @xcite . however , there is still a lack of detailed quantitative investigations of the psf for the homogeneous system with asymmetric hopping amplitudes of the two species , for the trapped system , and for imbalanced mixtures of the two species .",
    "here we investigate the properties of the psf of two - component ultracold bosons with attractive interspecies interaction , both in a homogeneous and a trapped optical lattice .",
    "this system can for sufficiently low filling be well described by a single - band bose - hubbard model with pure onsite interaction .",
    "we investigate the homogeneous system by means of bosonic dynamical mean field theory ( bdmft ) , which is a non - perturbative approach towards strongly - correlated bosonic systems  @xcite , and the trapped system by real - space bosonic dynamical mean field theory ( rbdmft )  @xcite , which includes arbitrary inhomogeneity such as a harmonic trap . for the homogeneous system , we focus on the phase diagram with filling number @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we also present the phase diagram for the experimentally realized heteronuclear @xmath1rb - @xmath2k mixtures , where double - species bose - einstein condensates with negative inter - species interactions have been observed  @xcite . for the trapped bose - bose mixture we study the coexistence of mott insulator , superfluid and psf .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a detailed description of the bose - hubbard model and the bdmft approach .",
    "section iii covers our results on the homogeneous bose - bose mixture in an optical lattice and the effect of the trap .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we consider a two - component bosonic mixture loaded into a 2d or 3d optical lattice . in experiments",
    "this mixture could consist of two different species , e.g @xmath1rb and @xmath2k as in @xcite or two different hyperfine states of a single isotope , e.g @xmath1rb as in @xcite .",
    "besides the optical lattice , we also impose an external harmonic trapping potential which introduces inhomogeneity in the system . for sufficiently low filling",
    ", the whole system can be effectively described by a two - component inhomogeneous bose - hubbard model within the single - band approximation @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes summation over nearest neighbor sites @xmath5 , and the two bosonic species are labeled by the index @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denotes the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator for species",
    "@xmath9 at site @xmath10 and @xmath11 the corresponding local density .",
    "due to possibly different masses or a spin - dependent optical lattice , these two species generally hop with non - equal amplitudes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the inter- and intra - species interactions , which can be tuned via feshbach resonances or spin - dependent lattices @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is the global chemical potential for the two bosonic species , and @xmath16 denotes the external harmonic trap , where @xmath17 is the strength of the harmonic trap and @xmath18 is the distance from the trap center .    to investigate properties of the system ,",
    "we apply bdmft for a homogeneous lattice  @xcite , and its real - space generalization ( rbdmft ) for the trapped system  @xcite . within rbdmft , the hamiltonian  ( [ hamil ] )",
    "is mapped onto a set of individual single - site problems , and the physical properties on each lattice site are determined by a local effective action which is captured by an effective anderson impurity model  @xcite solved by exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite .",
    "rbdmft fully captures the inhomogeneity of the system and is capable of providing an accurate and non - perturbative description of quantum phases and their excitations .",
    "the detailed formalism is presented in  @xcite .    to include the effect of spatial inhomogeneity",
    ", we also employ an lda approximation combined with single - site bdmft .",
    "the advantage of this approach is the larger system size accessible . within lda+bdmft , the local chemical potential for each species",
    "is set to @xmath19 . in this work ,",
    "we apply both rbdmft and lda+bdmft to the 2d trapped square lattice , and only lda+bdmft to the 3d trapped cubic lattice .",
    "in this section , we will investigate properties of two - component bosonic mixtures with negative inter - species interactions in a homogeneous 3d optical lattice at zero and finite temperature , and also in harmonically trapped , inhomogeneous systems both in 2d and 3d . for the homogeneous system , we will study the stability of the psf against asymmetric hopping and finite temperature . in the presence of an external harmonic trap , we will investigate finite size effects of the psf both in 2d and 3d within rbdmft and lda+bdmft .",
    "we choose the absolute value of the inter - species interaction @xmath20 as our unit of energy in the following .     with @xmath21.,width=364 ]      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     as pointed out above , asymmetry in the hopping of the two species does not destroy the psf .",
    "however , filling imbalance hinders the formation of the pairs  @xcite . we will now study this effect in more detail .",
    "the imbalance , @xmath22 , will be controlled by a nonzero chemical potential difference @xmath23 which can be viewed as an effective magnetic field .",
    "results in 2d are shown in fig .",
    "[ im_density_trap_2d ] . upon increasing @xmath24",
    ", the psf will cease to exist and be replaced by a superfluid phase , since the chemical potential difference eventually exceeds the pairing gap for the psf , allowing unpaired excess atoms to enter the psf region .",
    "we find that even small population imbalance can destroy the psf in a trapped system . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ im_density_trap_2d ] , the density distribution is almost unchanged for similar parameters .",
    "when increasing the imbalance parameter @xmath24 further , the psf will disappear already for a small population imbalance , since the particles form a conventional superfluid .",
    "here we do not find any phase separation .",
    "finally we discuss the influence of population imbalance on the psf in a trapped 3d cubic lattice using bdmft+lda . from our results shown in fig .",
    "[ im_density_trap_3d ] we conclude that here the physics is qualitatively similar to the 2d case .",
    "we have investigated low - temperature properties of bose - bose mixtures with attractive inter - species interaction both in 2d and 3d optical lattices by means of bdmft / rbdmft .",
    "in particular , we found that the pair - superfluid is stable also for asymmetric hopping of the two species .",
    "we obtained the critical temperature of the psf which we found to be of the same order as that of the xy - ferromagnet in the corresponding system with repulsive interactions of equal magnitude .",
    "we have confirmed the stability of the psf in a balanced bose - bose - mixture in the presence of the harmonic trap both in 2d and 3d . on the other hand",
    ", we found that even a small population imbalance can destroy the psf .",
    "this novel psf quantum phase can be detected in future experiments via the momentum distribution of pairs , which shows signatures of the pair condensate  @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with m. reza bakhtiari .",
