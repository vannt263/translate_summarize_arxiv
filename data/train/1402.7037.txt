    "this was important since this allowed us to define the parallel on - axis diffusivity @xmath61 as the measured @xmath54 value closest to the center for an uneven number of bins in the @xmath6 direction or the average of the two closest bins in the case of an even number of bins .    to our knowledge ,",
