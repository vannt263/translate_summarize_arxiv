    "absence of the @xmath0 decay mode of @xmath1 has defied a theoretical explanation for more than a decade@xcite .",
    "the recent measurement by bes collaboration@xcite has confirmed the absence of @xmath0 with even a higher precision , setting its upper bound at a level of factor more than 60 below what one naively expects from the decay @xmath4 .",
    "the measurement of other decay modes by bes@xcite seems to rule out all possible resolutions for the @xmath0 puzzle that have so far been proposed by theorists@xcite .",
    "for instance , the large @xmath5 branching contradicts the helicity suppression@xcite with or without large intrinsic charm@xcite .",
    "a vector glueball near the @xmath2 mass , if it should exist , can enhance the @xmath0 branching for @xmath2 relative to @xmath1@xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath6 is in line with expectation when we compare the @xmath7 with the inclusive ratio @xmath8 .",
    "what happens is not enhancement of @xmath0 in @xmath2 but suppression of @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile the amplitude analysis of the @xmath2 decay revealed that the relative phase of the gluonic and the one - photon decay amplitude is close to @xmath9 for all two - body decay channels so far studied ; @xmath10@xcite , @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , and @xmath13@xcite .",
    "we show in this paper that the recent bes measurement in @xmath14 is also compatible with a large phase .",
    "in contrast , the pattern of a large relative phase does not emerge for @xmath1 . within experimental uncertainties ,",
    "the relative phase is consistent with zero in the @xmath10 decay@xcite and the @xmath15 decay .",
    "this marked difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is another puzzle if the three - gluon decay is equally responsible for the strong decay of @xmath2 and @xmath1    there is one more experimental information relevant to the issue .",
    "that is the hadronic decay rate of @xmath1 which is normally attributed to @xmath16 . when we compute with the current data the inclusive gluonic decay rate of @xmath1 by subtracting the cascade and the electromagnetic decay rate from the total rate , it is 60 - 70% larger , within experimental uncertainties , than what we expect from the short - distance gluonic decay alone .",
    "this excess hadronic branching in @xmath1 may suggest that something more occurs in the gluonic decay of @xmath1 than in the @xmath2 decay .",
    "in this paper we combine these informations together and search the origin of the marked difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . while we should be apprehensive about experimental errors at present , they might give us a clue to a solution of the @xmath0 puzzle . in section ii , prompted by the experimental observation in the @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 channels , we postulate universality of the large relative phase between the gluon and the photon decay amplitudes .",
    "specifically , the gluonic decay amplitude acquires a large phase while the photon amplitude is real .",
    "we point out that a large phase is consistent with new bes data in @xmath17 .",
    "further progress in the bes analysis in this channel will shed more light .",
    "we turn to @xmath1 in section iii .",
    "the decay branching fractions of @xmath3 clearly show suppression of the gluon amplitude and favor a small relative phase between the gluon and the photon amplitude .",
    "we point out that a small phase is more likely in @xmath18 too . taking the possible excess in the inclusive hadronic decay rate of @xmath1 seriously , we propose that this excess is related to both the suppression and the small relative phase of the @xmath10 amplitude .",
    "our proposition is that an additional decay process generating the excess should largely cancel the short - distance gluon amplitude in the exclusive decay into @xmath10 and that the resulting small residual amplitude is not only real but also destructively interferes with the photon amplitude . in section iv ,",
    "we first present general consequences of the destructive interference .",
    "we then examine two scenarios which may possibly generate the excess inclusive gluonic decay .",
    "one is the contribution of the virtual @xmath19 intermediate state .",
    "the other is a resonance , a glueball or a four - quark resonance , near the @xmath1 mass . though neither idea is novel nor highly appealing , they seem to be among a very few possibilities that have not yet been ruled out by experiment .",
    "the relative phase between the gluon and the photon amplitude in the decay @xmath20 has been analyzed with broken flavor su(3 )",
    "symmetry@xcite including the @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing .",
    "all analyses clearly show that the relative phase should be very large and not far from @xmath9 with experimetnal uncertainties .",
    "the su(3 ) analysis was made also for the @xmath11 modes@xcite and the @xmath12 modes@xcite for which leading gluon amplitude is su(3 ) violating .",
    "the relative phase were found to be equally large for these modes .",
    "furthermore comparison of the electromagnetic form factors in the timelike region with the @xmath2 decay branching fractions revealed that the relative phase is very close to @xmath9 in the @xmath13 decay channels too@xcite .",
    "a question arises as to whether this large relative phase is universal to all decays of @xmath2 or not .",
    "there is no persuasive theoretical answer to it at present .",
    "in addition to those two - body channels already analyzed , the recent bes measurement@xcite on @xmath17 , @xmath23 is relevant to this issue .",
    "we examine here these branching fractions together with the @xmath24 branching fraction , @xmath25@xcite .",
    "decay modes assumed a zero relative phase and used on a preliminary value of the upper bound on @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 analysis of ref.@xcite should be disregarded .",
    "however , the analysis of the @xmath18 of ref.@xcite remains valid . ]",
    "since @xmath27 and @xmath28 are superpositions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 octet , respectively , @xmath33 with @xmath34@xcite , we can parametrize the three decay amplitudes in terms of the gluon amplitude @xmath35 of the @xmath32 octet and the photon amplitudes @xmath36 of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; @xmath37 since there are two independent helicity amplitudes ( or @xmath38- and @xmath39-waves ) for @xmath15 , we should use this parametrization separately for the @xmath38-wave and the @xmath39-wave amplitudes .",
    "the three branching fractions can be fitted with @xmath40 if the ratio @xmath41 is comparable in magnitude to @xmath42 , we should expect that @xmath43@xcite . for @xmath44 and @xmath34 , the ratios of the branching fractions prior to the phase space corrections , denoted by @xmath45 ,",
    "take values as @xmath46 while the inequality @xmath47 can easily be realized by a wide range of parameter values , the other inequality @xmath48 is a little tight .",
    "if we allow @xmath49 larger than @xmath50 and/or increase the value of @xmath51 , however , the current central values of the branching fractions are consistent with the large phase hypothesis .",
    "we should also point out that if the su(3 ) breaking correction is made by the meson wavefunctions @xmath52 , it is likely to enhance @xmath53 over @xmath54 to the direction in favor of the large phase fit .",
    "if we leave @xmath36 unrestricted in magnitude and phase , a triangular relation holds for the amplitudes as @xmath55 determination of the @xmath38-to-@xmath39 wave ratio of the amplitudes and further study of @xmath56 will eventually resolve the composition of amplitudes and test the large phase hypothesis in @xmath15 .",
    "as it was pointed out previously@xcite , it is also important to resolve the discrepancy between @xmath54 and @xmath57@xcite , which theory predicts to be equal .    to summarize the experimental situation of the two - body @xmath2 decay amplitudes ,",
    "the existing data strongly favor large relative phases close to @xmath9 between the gluon and the photon decay amplitudes for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and are consistent with a large phase for @xmath15 .    what does theory say about these relative phases ? in the perturbative picture , the gluonic decay of @xmath2 proceeds as depicted in fig.1a .",
    "the inclusive decay rate is computed with the gluons placed on mass shell . in contrast , the photon being far off shell , no corresponding on - shell intermediate state appears in the perturbative diagrams of the photon amplitude ( fig.1b ) .",
    "although perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is a good description of inclusive charmonium decays , it is questionable whether it works for two - body decay channels of charmonia . to be specific ,",
    "the pqcd prediction of the asymptotic pion form factor@xcite , @xmath58 has not been reached at the @xmath2 mass@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the helicity suppression argument of pqcd fails for the @xmath5 decay channel .",
    "though it is tempting , therefore , we can not argue for the large relative phases on the basis of perturbative diagrams .",
    "whether or not these large relative phases are universal to all two - body decay modes of @xmath2 must be determined by experiment . despite lack of a good theoretical argument at present",
    ", we suspect nonetheless that the universal large phases so far found are not an accident .",
    "if the relative phases are close to @xmath9 , it is more likely that the photon decay amplitudes are real and consequently the gluon decay amplitudes are imaginary .",
    "the reason is as follows : in order for the photon decay amplitude to have a substantial phase , the final @xmath59 created by the virtual @xmath60 should have a large absorptive part of a long - distance origin .",
    "this can happen if there should be a relatively sharp @xmath59 resonance just around @xmath2 .",
    "more likely is that many resonances exist below @xmath2 as in the vector - meson - dominance scenario , or that as in the dual resonance model , many increasingly broader resonances appear all the way to high energies@xcite . in the former case ,",
    "only the tails of low - lying resonances contribute to the real part . in the latter case",
    ", a few nearby broad resonances can contribute to the imaginary part , but they are outnumbered by many more resonances below and above @xmath61 that contribute to the real part . in comparison , we have less insight in hadronization dynamics of the gluon decay .",
    "motivated by the results in the amplitude analyses of the two - body of @xmath2 decays , we make two postulates : + ( 1 ) the relative phases between the gluon and the photon decay amplitudes are universally large for all two - body decays of @xmath2 .",
    "the photon decay amplitudes are predominantly real and consequently the gluon decay amplitudes are imaginary . + ( 2 )",
    "the same pattern holds for @xmath1 decay as well .",
    "+ these are the starting assumptions of our analysis that follows .",
    "the only large energy scale involved in the three - gluon decay of charmonia is the charm quark mass @xmath62 . whether one accepts the argument of the universal large phase in exclusive channels or",
    "not , therefore , one would naively expect that the corresponding phases should not be much different between the @xmath2 decay and the @xmath1 decay .",
    "however , experimental data so far available show that the phases are small at least in some two - body decay modes of @xmath1 .",
    "the strongest evidence is in the decay @xmath3 , which includes the puzzling @xmath63 . in the case",
    "that the final @xmath64 meson is an octet , we can parametrize the @xmath3 decay amplitudes with the su(3 ) singlet amplitude @xmath35 , the su(3 ) breaking correction @xmath65 due to @xmath66 , and the photon amplitude @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are introduced for the @xmath64 singlet . for the @xmath70-@xmath22 mixing",
    ", we assume the nonet scheme .",
    "the parametrization of the amplitudes@xcite is listed in table i for the decay modes so far studied in experiment@xcite . since the analyzed channels are limited and the uncertainties in their branching fractions are still large , we are unable to perform a meaningful @xmath71 fit at present",
    ". therefore , we present only fits to the central values by referring to table i.    first of all , if we ignored the photon amplitude @xmath72 , we would obtain @xmath73 , which contradicts with experiment , @xmath74 _ vs _ @xmath75 . the large splitting between these branching fractions",
    "requires that @xmath67 be comparable to @xmath35 . if we set @xmath35 and @xmath65 to zero , we would obtain up to phase space corrections @xmath76 in contradiction with the measurement , @xmath77 .",
    "may be responsible for part of the discrepancy . ] in order to come closer to this ratio of the measured values , a large constructive interference should occur in @xmath78 , that is , the relative phase must be small between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath35 and @xmath65 have a common phase , we have a large destructive interference between @xmath35 and @xmath67 for both @xmath0 and @xmath81 in agreement with experiment .",
    "amplitudes is found in the earlier paper by chen and braaten@xcite and , in particular , in the paper by tuan@xcite . ]",
    "this solves the @xmath0 puzzle and explains also the missing of the @xmath81 mode in experiment .    with these qualitative observations in mind",
    ", we have fitted to the central values of the observed branching fractions and then have computed with those parameter values the branching fractions of the modes for which only the upper bounds have been determined . in table",
    "i we have listed the fit with @xmath82 and the large phase fit with @xmath83 for comparison . when the central values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are fitted with @xmath86 , the ratio of the photon and the gluon amplitude turns out to be @xmath87 for comparison , @xmath88 in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "we would expect @xmath89 if the ratio of @xmath90 to @xmath91 is roughly equal to @xmath92 . since experiment shows that @xmath93 is about the same for @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the large number in eq.([suppression ] ) results from strong suppression of the total gluonic amplitude @xmath79 in @xmath1 . as the value of @xmath65",
    "is varied in the range of @xmath94 , the value of @xmath95 varies between 0 and 0.04@xmath96 .",
    "the values for @xmath95 and @xmath97 can be increased if we stretch within the experimental uncertainties of @xmath84 and @xmath98 .",
    "in contrast , the fit with @xmath99 overshoots the upper bound on @xmath97 and , if @xmath100 , the upper bound on @xmath95 very badly .",
    "a fit with @xmath101 is virtually impossible even with experimental uncertainties unless @xmath102 .",
    "we thus conclude that the relative phase between @xmath35 and @xmath103 should be small in @xmath3 contrary to the @xmath2 decay .",
    "though it is less conclusive , a small phase seems to be favored in the @xmath15 decay of @xmath1 too .",
    "it is conspicuous in experiment@xcite that the @xmath104 mode is strongly suppressed relative to the @xmath105 : @xmath106 @xmath107 is half way between them@xcite : @xmath108 we can use eq . ( 4 ) as the parametrization of @xmath18 .",
    "first of all , if @xmath35 dominated over @xmath36 , we would have @xmath109 for @xmath110 in disagreement with experiment . just as in @xmath3 , @xmath111 is comparable to @xmath49 .",
    "next , the strong suppression of @xmath112 relative to @xmath105 can be realized only when @xmath113 interferes destructively with @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the relative phase between @xmath35 and @xmath36 must be small modulo @xmath115 . to obtain @xmath116",
    ", we need @xmath117 .",
    "the allowed range of the amplitude ratios was plotted in ref.@xcite by choosing all amplitudes as relatively real and assuming tentatively the s - wave decay for phase - space corrections . though it is not impossible to fit the three branching fractions with @xmath118 , we must have @xmath119 and @xmath120 in that case .    to summarize for @xmath1 ,",
    "the data on @xmath10 virtually excludes the possibility of a small phase between @xmath35 and @xmath67 .",
    "a fit to @xmath15 has more room when the relative phase is small .",
    "there is no evidence for that the relative phase must be large in @xmath1 .",
    "for some reason , a large relative phase does not seem to occur in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "we ask what causes this marked difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 when we postulate the universal large phase for @xmath1 as well as for @xmath2 .",
    "it has been noticed that when one computes the inclusive hadronic decay rate of @xmath1 through @xmath121 by subtracting the rates of the cascade and electromagnetic decays from the total decay rate , it is substantially larger than what we expect from an extrapolation of @xmath2 .",
    "the number with a conservative error estimate based on the listings of _ reviews of particle physics_@xcite is @xmath122 which should be compared with @xmath123 smaller errors ( @xmath124 _ vs _",
    "@xmath125 ) have been attached in a recent literature@xcite with a different error estimate .",
    "we would expect that the two numbers should be equal to each other since the wavefunctions at origin appear in common in eqs.([r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy of 60 - 70% between them alarms us particularly because all numbers involved have been repeatedly measured over many years .    in comparison",
    "we find no similar excess in @xmath126 though experimetnal undertaintues are large . in terms of the ratio of branching ratios , @xmath127 , three @xmath128 s are more in line : @xmath129 where the total leptonic branching for @xmath130 quoted in @xcite is sum of the cascade decay branchings",
    "@xmath131 in view of the @xmath132 invariant mass spectrum@xcite and also of its magnitude ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "it is counted in the radiative decay branchings separately listed in @xcite .",
    "] has been substituted with three times @xmath134 , the only quoted leptonic branching .",
    "it appears that the excess in @xmath135 is unique to @xmath1 .",
    "however , this excess in the inclusive rate has not shown up in the rates of the exclusive channels so far measured .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath136 scatter around the expected value ( @xmath137 13 - 14% of eq.([r2 ] ) ) , which was often called the _",
    "14% rule_. some remarks should be in order on it .",
    "first of all , the 14% rule is largely violated in many of two - body and quasi - two - body channels , as we recently learned in the bes data@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 channel is an extreme case . for multihadron channels ,",
    "there are actually not so many modes that are available for testing the 14% rule . and @xmath1 .",
    "then the number is dominated by three modes , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which happen to be below 14% .",
    "the mode @xmath138 is actually @xmath0 and its nonresonant content is consistent with zero@xcite .",
    "more revealing are the ratios of individual modes . ] in table ii , we have tabulated the ratios for the modes not listed in @xcite but available for comparison .",
    "we see that the ratios scatter rather widely above and below 14% with some tendency of being smaller than 14% , but with fairly large experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is important to notice that the branching fractions of all modes in table ii add up to no more than 15% of the total gluonic decay branching of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , only one charge state has been available for comparison from each of @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "we have not yet seen comparison of the rest .",
    "the so - called 14% rule is based on very limited number of decay modes .",
    "it is premature to preclude the hadronic excess with the data of multihadron exclusive channels .",
    "if future experiment shows that the hadronic excess in @xmath1 is real , it may have something to do with the @xmath0 puzzle@xcite and with the abrupt change of the relative phase of amplitudes from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "a process responsible for the excess inclusive hadron rate can interfere with the short - distance gluon decay in exclusive modes . if its amplitude makes a large destructive interference with the three - gluon amplitude in @xmath3 and if the sum is nearly real and comparable to the photon amplitude in magnitude , our puzzle can be solved .",
    "we shall look into possible sources of this rate excess in the following .",
    "if the origin of the problem is in the interference of an unknown additional process with the short - distance gluon decay of @xmath1 , we expect a general pattern of correlation between the decay angular distribution and suppression or enhancement .",
    "the decay angular distribution for two final hadrons is generally of the form , @xmath145 where @xmath51 is the polar angle measured from the @xmath146 beam direction . for @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "decays , the value of @xmath147 is constrained kinematically to + 1 and @xmath148 , respectively , while it is determined dynamically by the helicity content , @xmath149 or 0 , of the final state in other decays . in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , therefore , any additional amplitude has the same angular dependence as the three - gluon and the photon amplitude irrespective of its origin .",
    "consequently a high degree of destructive or constructive interference with an additional amplitude is possible in these decays .",
    "observation of the strongest suppression in the @xmath10 mode is consistent with this pattern@xcite . we expect that the decay rates of @xmath150 may also be quite different from those of @xmath151 . in terms of @xmath152 , the current data@xcite give @xmath153 within the large experimental uncertainties we see a hint of large constructive interference in @xmath154 .",
    "in contrast , in other processes an additional amplitude and the three - gluon amplitude have different angular distributions in general .",
    "a large interference can occur only when dynamical mechanisms of two processes are similar .",
    "otherwise it should be a result of a high degree of accident . when a large disparity is observed between corresponding two - meson decay rates of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , therefore",
    ", the decay angular distribution of this channel will also be very different between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this will give a good test of the idea of interference with an additional amplitude .",
    "the other consequence is in multibody final states .",
    "since the additional process enhances the inclusive rate , a large number of exclusive decay channels should receive enhancement rather than suppression . when there are many hadrons in the final state , chance of interference between amplitudes of different decay mechanism is much smaller because of difference in subenergy dependence and event topology .",
    "therefore enhancement will not be dramatic .",
    "while we have not yet seen such enhancemnet in table ii , we expect that the branching fraction tend to be enhanced in many nonresonant multibody channels of @xmath1 relative to @xmath2 .",
    "where does the additional amplitude possibly come from ?",
    "there are few options left in modifying charmonium physics radically .",
    "since aspects of perturbative qcd have been well understood , we are bound to look for the origin of the problem in long - distance physics of one kind or another .",
    "one unique feature of @xmath1 is a close proximity of its mass to the @xmath19 threshold .",
    "the @xmath1 mass is only 43 mev ( 53 mev ) below @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , while @xmath130 is 200 mev away from the @xmath158 threshold .",
    "can the small energy difference between @xmath1 and @xmath19 have anything to do with the excess ?",
    "it may happen that @xmath1 picks up a light quark pair through soft gluons and dissociates virtually into @xmath19 , which in turn annihilate into light hadrons .",
    "( see fig.2 . )",
    "the dominant process of the @xmath19 annihilation is through @xmath159 annihilation through a single hard gluon .",
    "the small energy denominator enhances creation of virtual @xmath19 while @xmath160-wave creation compensates the enhancement .",
    "it is difficult , actually nearly impossible , to give a reliable computation of this sequence . deferring estimate of the rate to future",
    ", we shall comment here only on whether the @xmath19 contribution can have a final - state interaction phase large enough to cancel the perturbative gluon amplitude or not .",
    "since the @xmath19 intermediate state is above the @xmath1 mass , a phase of amplitude must come from the subsequent annihilation of @xmath159 and thereafter .",
    "after an energetic light quark pair @xmath59 is created from @xmath159 , each of @xmath59 picks up a soft light quark from the light quark cloud of @xmath19 to form mesons .",
    "( see fig.3a . )",
    "kinematically , this step of the hadron formation process is quite different from that of the timelike electromagnetic form factor of a meson in which energetic light quarks pick up collinear quarks created by a hard gluon .",
    "( see fig.3b . ) in our case color - dipole moment is large for all pairs of quarks@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the _ c.m .",
    "_ energy of a hard quark in one meson and a soft quark in the other meson is in the low energy resonance region , @xmath161 therefore , one can not argue that final - state interactions should be small between final mesons .",
    "we expect that there is a good chance for the amplitude of @xmath162 to acquire a substantial final - state interaction phase .",
    "weakness in this argument is that the phase can be large but need not be large .",
    "the idea of the virtual @xmath19 dissociation actually has some common feature with that of the `` higher fock component '' of charmonia@xcite",
    ". the @xmath19 state can be viewed as part of the four - quark fock space of @xmath1 .",
    "the higher fock component was proposed as an additional contribution to @xmath20 to solve the @xmath0 puzzle@xcite .",
    "it was argued that it is more significant in @xmath2 than in @xmath1 . as we have emphasized , however , there is nothing anomalous about @xmath20 .",
    "the second idea is a twist of an old one : a noncharm resonance may exist near the @xmath1 mass and give an extra contribution to the hadronic decay rate . a glueball was proposed earlier at the @xmath2 mass to boost the @xmath0 decay rate of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "however , we now want it near @xmath1 not near @xmath2 .",
    "we look into the possibility that some resonance around the @xmath1 mass , a glueball or four - quark , destructively interferes with the perturbative @xmath165 decay .",
    "admittedly , the idea is _ ad hoc _ and there is some difficulty aside from unnaturalness .",
    "light - quark resonances of high mass ( @xmath166 gev ) and low spin are normally too broad to be even recognized as resonances .",
    "four - quark resonances may be an alternative if they exist at all .",
    "the mass of @xmath167 gev is normally considered as too high for the lowest vector glueball .",
    "an excited glueball state of @xmath168 serves our purpose .",
    "whatever its origin is , let us introduce here such a resonance , call it @xmath169 , and see its consequences .    in order for @xmath1 to decay through",
    "@xmath169 as strongly as through three gluons , the coupling @xmath170 of @xmath169 to @xmath1 defined by @xmath171 must be large enough .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath169 mixing at the @xmath1 mass is given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 is the total width of @xmath169 .",
    "it leads to @xmath175 when @xmath176 . to obtain @xmath177",
    ", we need therefore @xmath178 if @xmath169 is a light - quark resonance @xmath59 , @xmath179 would be much too small for the following reason : while @xmath180 is of the order of @xmath181 for @xmath59 , we expect @xmath182 because of the @xmath183 suppression of @xmath184 .",
    "therefore there is no chance to satisfy eq.([mixing ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the same argument applies to four - quark resonances .    for glueballs",
    ", we simply do not have enough quantitative understanding to rule out a large enough coupling to @xmath1 .",
    "hou and soni@xcite proposed a glueball near the @xmath2 mass in order to enhance @xmath4 ( and its symmetry - related modes ) but not other decay modes . to accomplish it",
    ", this glueball must have very special , if not unnatural , properties@xcite : it is nearly degenerate with @xmath2 with a quite narrow width for an object of mass @xmath185 gev and decays predominantly into @xmath10 .",
    "later hou@xcite relaxed the constraint on the @xmath0 branching to argue that such a glueball was not yet ruled out by the search of the bes collaboration@xcite .    in our case , since a glueball is introduced to account for the hadronic excess , it should couple not primarily to the @xmath10 channels , but to many other channels .",
    "what we need is a generic vector glueball with no special or unusual properties .",
    "if @xmath174 is as narrow as 100 mev , for instance , the mixing @xmath186 would be able to account for the excess in the inclusive hadron decay of @xmath1 .",
    "the width can be wider .",
    "in that case the pole transition strength @xmath170 should be stronger according to eq.([mixing ] ) . since the glueball @xmath169 couples to a photon only indirectly through its mixing to a quark pair , it is hard to detect @xmath169 in the hadronic cross section of @xmath146 annihilation near the @xmath1 mass .",
    "searching by hadronic reactions such as @xmath187 annihilation is a daunting task . from a purely experimental viewpoint ,",
    "such a resonance has not been ruled out@xcite .",
    "though the resonance scenario is admittedly a long shot , it is one of a very few options left to us .",
    "one reason to pursue this somewhat unnatural scenario is that the amplitude for @xmath188 has automatically a large phase when @xmath189 since the coupling @xmath170 is likely real , that is , dominated by the dispersive part .",
    "if that is the case , the resonant amplitude can interfere strongly with the three - gluon amplitude in two - meson decays .",
    "we have searched for a clue to solve the @xmath0 puzzle in this paper .",
    "our purpose is to locate the source of the problem rather than to offer a final solution of the problem .",
    "two threads have been exposed which may eventually lead us to a solution of the @xmath0 puzzle .",
    "they are the phases of the decay amplitudes and a possible excess in the inclusive hadronic decay rate of @xmath1 .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the excess will be the most useful in directing theorists .",
    "if it is confirmed , it will be quite an important experimental discovery by itself .",
    "one crucial experimental information will be the angular distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 into the channels other than @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "difference in the angular distributions should have direct correlation with enhancement and suppression in general .",
    "as for the source of an additional process , the virtual @xmath19 pair and the vector glueball are two options that can not be ruled out . to be frank , however , we admit that both ideas have unnaturalness .",
    "more an attractive alternative is highly desired .",
    "it is possible that the large relative phases so far observed in @xmath2 decay are an accident and that the @xmath0 puzzle is a problem of incalculable long - distance complications .",
    "however , our hope is that there might be something novel , simple , or fundamental hidden beneath the issue .",
