    "a birth - and - death process on @xmath0 is a continuous time markov chain ( ctmc ) that evolves as follows .",
    "given a current state @xmath1 it jumps either to @xmath2 , or to @xmath3 ( if @xmath4 ) at certain state dependent rates .",
    "the long term behaviour of a birth - and - death process is well known .",
    "namely , given a set of transition rates one can , in principle , determine whether the corresponding birth - and - death process is recurrent / positive recurrent , or transient / explosive , and compute various characteristics of the process .",
    "these results can be found in many books ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the long term behaviour of multivariate markov processes with similar dynamics is less known .    in this paper",
    "we study the long term behaviour of ctmc @xmath5 evolving as follows . given @xmath6 the markov chain jumps to @xmath7 and to @xmath8 at rates @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive functions on @xmath13 .",
    "also , the markov chain jumps from @xmath14 to @xmath15 at the constant rate of @xmath16 , provided @xmath17 , and it jumps to @xmath18 at the same constant rate of @xmath16 , provided that @xmath19 .",
    "the markov chain is a two - dimensional analogue of integer valued birth - and - death processes , and can be interpreted in terms of two interacting birth - and - death processes .",
    "the construction of the birth rates allows to model various types of both individual dynamics and interaction between the markov chain components .",
    "function @xmath11 determines , in terms of statistical physics , the free dynamics of a component .",
    "interaction between components is modelled by choosing an appropriate function @xmath12 .",
    "if , say , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent identically distributed birth - and - death processes .",
    "given @xmath11 , one can choose a decreasing @xmath12 in order to model a competitive interaction .",
    "if @xmath12 is increasing , then a component s growth is accelerated by its neighbour .",
    "recall that a birth - and - death process on @xmath23 is a classic probabilistic model for the size of a population .",
    "therefore ctmc @xmath24 can be regarded as a stochastic model for two interacting populations .",
    "the model is related to stochastic population models formulated in terms of two interacting birth - and - death processes ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in these models , which are stochastic versions of the famous lotke - volterra model",
    ", a pair of birth - and - death processes typically evolves as follows .",
    "given a current state @xmath14 of the components , the individual transition rates are linear in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while interaction terms , included usually in death rates ( i.e. competitive interaction ) , are proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "our model is in the spirit of the more general approach proposed by gauss g.f .",
    "( @xcite ) and kolmogorov a.n .",
    "( @xcite ) for modelling interactions in ecology .",
    "although they considered deterministic population models , the idea is rather general .",
    "according to this approach , the interaction between species should be modelled by transition rates specified by general functions with suitable ( suggested by a motivating application ) monotonicity properties .",
    "a brief , but informative presentation of these ideas is given in @xcite , where further references can be found . in our model",
    "the interaction is built into the birth rates , though the model can be generalised by allowing for non - constant death rates .",
    "we do not explore further the relationship of the markov chain with stochastic population models and focus on its long term behaviour which is of interest from a mathematical point of view .",
    "it should be also noted that our markov chain is a particular example of non - homogeneous random walks .",
    "the long term behaviour of non - homogeneous random walks is much less studied ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) in contrast to homogeneous random walks in domains with boundaries ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we systematically apply the lyapunov function approach in our proofs .",
    "this approach is well known and widely used for determining whether a markov process is recurrent or transient ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in theorem  [ t1 ]",
    "we establish whether the markov chain is transient or recurrent under fairly general assumptions on functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "though the asymptotic behaviour of the markov chain in this theorem can be guessed from approximate sketches of the vector field of its mean infinitesimal jumps ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) , the lyapunov function approach helps to formalize these intuitive ideas . in theorems  [ t2 ] and",
    "[ t3 ] we obtain a more detailed description of the long term behaviour of the markov chain in some transient cases .",
    "it should be noted that the lyapunov function method is also a powerful tool for detecting phenomena that might not be immediately visible and are more refined than just recurrence / transience .",
    "theorem 3 below provides an example of such a phenomenon .",
    "in particular we show that in a transient case specified by polynomial functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 the markov chain with probability one escapes to infinity in the following way .",
    "namely , the markov chain is eventually absorbed to either a horizontal strip @xmath28 , or a vertical strip @xmath28 , where @xmath1 is explicitly computable . moreover , being eventually adsorbed by the horizontal ( vertical ) strip , the markov chain visits every line @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) infinitely often .",
    "let @xmath31 be a probability space on which the markov chain is defined .",
    "denote by @xmath32 the expectation with respect to probability measure @xmath33 . recall that the embedded markov chain , corresponding to a ctmc , is a discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) with the same state space , and that makes the same jumps as the ctmc with probabilities proportional to the corresponding jump rates",
    "let @xmath34 be the dtmc corresponding to the ctmc @xmath24 .",

    "it is easy to see that theorem  [ t1 ] describes the long term evolution of the markov chain in six different cases .",

    "[ r2 ] it should be noted that assumptions of the theorem are mostly motivated by the case of polynomial functions , e.g. @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "some of these assumptions can be slightly weakened without changing the proof .",
    "for example , in part 2 ) the infinite limit of the product @xmath70 at infinity in the case of non - increasing @xmath12 can be replaced by a sufficiently large limit ( at least @xmath71 ) .",
    "such generalizations are not of much interest . also , some of these assumptions can be weakened provided that an additional information is available about functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( e.g. see remark  [ r5 ] in appendix )",
    ".    [ r3 ] let us also discuss assumption ( * a1 * ) : @xmath56 in part 1)a ) of the theorem .",
    "ideally , we would like to replace it by the following assumption ( * a2 * ) : @xmath59 .",
    "assumption ( * a1 * ) is violated , for example , by functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 . note that assumptions ( * a1 * ) and ( * a2 * ) are equivalent in many cases .",
    "moreover , in many cases these assumptions are equivalent to the following stronger assumption ( * a3 * ) : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "for example , this is the case if @xmath60 is a regularly varying function of index @xmath76 .",
    "equivalence can take place for a non - regular varying @xmath11 as well , for example , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "[ r4 ] it should be noted that there is a certain phase transition in the long term behaviour of the markov chain in the case of non - increasing and vanishing at infinity @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath12 is also non - increasing with zero limit at infinity , then the markov chain is positive recurrent .",
    "if @xmath12 increases , but @xmath81 as @xmath64 , then the ctmc is still recurrent . if @xmath12 increases sufficiently fast so that @xmath65 as @xmath64 , then the markov chain becomes transient and can be even explosive .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     before we formulate theorems  [ t2 ] and  [ t3 ] , we would like to consider an exponential case , i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",

    "a direct computation gives that the ctmc is reversible with the following invariant measure @xmath88 , which is summable if and only if @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the sufficient condition of positive recurrence in theorem  [ t1 ] is also a necessary one in the exponential case .",
