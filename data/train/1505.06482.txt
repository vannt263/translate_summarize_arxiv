    "in high energy physics , the beam energy and the luminosity are usually the two most important parameters that quantify the performance of particle colliders .",
    "the former one is necessary to provide available energy for production of new effects , i.e. , a new massive particle ; while the latter one measures the ability of a particle accelerator to produce the required number of interactions , which is especially important when there are only rare events with a small production cross section @xmath4 ( the total area of overlap of two colliding particles ) .",
    "the particle accelerators can not produce continuous particle beams but beams consisting of a sequence of  bunches \" of particles because of the time varying fields used to produce acceleration .",
    "therefore , it is two such beam bunches that are brought into collision in fact .",
    "suppose one bunch of @xmath5 particles moving in one direction collides head - on with a bunch of @xmath6 particles in the opposite direction .",
    "both of them have cross - sectional area @xmath7 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fcollision ] , any single particle in one bunch ( @xmath5 ) has a chance of a fraction of the area @xmath8 to  meet \" a particle in the other bunch ( @xmath6 ) . the number of interactions per passage of two such bunches is then @xmath9 . hence , the interaction rate is given by r&=&f_int , where f is the frequency of bunch collisions .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath10 , is defined as the interaction rate per unite cross section : & = & = f . for a  round gaussian",
    "\" particle distribution , the luminosity can be written as & = & f , [ elhead ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 characterize the gaussian transverse beam profiles in the horizontal ( bend ) and vertical directions and present the sizes of the beam .",
    "luminosities are often expressed in _",
    "cgs _ units : @xmath13 .",
    "a glance at the luminosity formula reveals that to raise luminosity one must increase the collision frequency , bunch intensity and lower the beam cross sectional area .",
    "the number of betatron oscillations ( bounded oscillatory motion about the design trajectory corresponding to the transverse stability ) per turn in a synchrotron is called _ tune _ and given by @xcite . &",
    "= & , where the independent variable @xmath14 is path length along the design trajectory and the quantity @xmath15 is usually referred to as the amplitude function . in a colliding beam accelerator , each time the beams cross each other , the particles in one beam feel the electric and magnetic forces due to the particles in the other beam . since the particles in these two beams have opposite velocity directions , the electric and magnetic forces do not cancel but rather add , creating a net defocussing force .",
    "in other words , the particles of one bunch see the other bunch as a nonlinear lens in a bunch - bunch collision . for particles undergoing infinitesimal betatron oscillations in a highly relativistic gaussian beam ,",
    "the net force would be f&=&r , where @xmath16 is the number of particles of each bunch ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the radius of the accelerating orbit , and @xmath19 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the horizontal and vertical beam sizes ) . the tune shift experienced by the particle would be & = & ds + & = & n ds . here",

    "high luminosity requires short bunches with a very small vertical beta - function @xmath35 at the ip and a high beam intensity @xmath38 with small vertical emittance @xmath26 .",
    "large horizontal beam size @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fcrossangle ] ) and large horizontal emittance @xmath25 can be tolerated .",
    "though short bunches are usually hard to make , with large piwinski angle @xmath33 the overlapping area becomes much smaller than @xmath39 , allowing significant @xmath40 decrease and a very significant potential gain in the luminosity @xcite .",
    "the large piwinski angle increases luminosity by allowing a small @xmath41 , but decreases the luminosity by effectively decreasing @xmath42 however , the beam - beam tune shift is now small and a large gain in luminosity may be possible by raising the beam - beam tune shift to its limit .",
    "due to the synchrotron radiation , the energy loss by one electron in a circular orbit is e&=&. because an electron has a small mass , the transverse beam size is naturally damped by the synchrotron radiation .",
