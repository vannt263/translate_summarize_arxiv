    "objects with sizes and masses between those of globular clusters and compact ellipticals ( @xmath13100 pc ; @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) were first discovered in spectroscopic surveys of galaxy clusters ( hilker  1999 ; drinkwater  2000 ) .",
    "they were quickly dubbed  ultra - compact dwarf \" galaxies ( ucds ) , even though their galaxian nature was unclear .",
    "large populations of ucds have been discovered in fornax , virgo , and other galaxy clusters , as well as in group and field environments  see reviews in chilingarian  ( 2011 ) , norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) , and brodie  ( 2011 ) .",
    "ucd formation scenarios have coalesced around two poles : star cluster or galaxy . in the former scenario , ucds form the massive end of the normal sequence of globular clusters ( mieske  2012 ) .",
    "further , if some star clusters form in gravitationally - bound complexes , these can merge to make objects that are larger and more massive than single clusters ( brns  2011 ) .",
    "alternatively , ucds could be galaxies that formed in individual dark matter halos  either  in situ \" , as unusual , extremely compact galaxies  or as the products of tidal stripping of more massive progenitor galaxies ( e.g. , drinkwater  2003 )",
    ".    a reasonable synthesis of these scenarios may be that the least - massive  ucds \" , with @xmath16 , are largely star clusters , while the most massive objects ( @xmath17 ) are galaxies , or the tidally stripped remnants thereof . at intermediate masses",
    "both star clusters and galaxies may co - exist ( e.g. , norris & kannappan 2011 ; brodie  2011 ) .    there is more at stake than the natural desire to understand these novel stellar systems .",
    "if a significant fraction of ucds contain dark matter , then they form a populous class that must be included in counts of subhalos for comparisons to cosmological theory .",
    "further , if some ucds are formed by tidal stripping , their chemical and structural properties help trace galaxy transformation .    here",
    "we report the discovery of an extraordinary ucd around the virgo elliptical ngc 4649 ( m60 ) .",
    "it has a half - light radius of 24 pc but a stellar mass of @xmath18 , giving it the highest surface density of any galaxy in the local universe .",
    "we also present evidence that this ucd may contain a central supermassive black hole .",
    "we discovered m60-ucd1 in the _ hubble space telescope_/advanced camera for surveys imaging of strader  ( 2012 ) .",
    "we have a single orbit of imaging split between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( hereafter @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "m60-ucd1 is located at ( r.a . ,",
    "= ( 190.8999 , 11.5347 ) in decimal j2000 coordinates .",
    "this is at a projected distance of only @xmath23 kpc from the center of m60 ( figure 1 ; assuming a distance of 16.5 mpc ; blakeslee  2009 ) .",
    "no mention is made of m60-ucd1 in previous virgo surveys , including the acs virgo cluster survey ( ct  2004 ) .",
    "it is present in the sdss dr7 photometric catalog ( abazajian  2009 ) as j124335.96 + 113204.6 , and was classified by simard  ( 2011 ) as a background galaxy .",
    "a spectrum of m60-ucd1 was obtained on the night of 17 january 2012 with keck / deimos ( faber  2003 ) , utilizing the 1200 l / mm grating centered at 7800   and a 1  slit ( resolution @xmath24  ) .",
    "we obtained three 30-min exposures in 0.8  seeing . using the spec2d pipeline ( cooper  2012 ) ,",
    "the spectra were extracted , calibrated , and combined in the standard manner to produce a final one - dimensional spectrum .    to improve stellar population constraints ,",
    "further spectroscopy was undertaken with mmt / hectospec ( fabricant  2005 ) on 16 may 2012 , using the 270 l / mm grating with wavelength coverage from 3700 to 9100   and 5   resolution .",
    "three 20-min exposures were taken in 0.9  seeing .",
    "these hectospec data were pipeline - reduced in a standard manner as described in mink  ( 2007 ) .",
    "aperture photometry of m60-ucd1 gives a total integrated magnitude of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , yielding @xmath27 ( the @xmath21 and @xmath22 magnitudes in this paper are ab ) .",
    "the measured half - light radius ( see below ) is @xmath28 pc .",
    "the inferred total luminosities are : @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ; and @xmath31 . with @xmath32",
    ", m60-ucd1 is the most luminous ucd known ( see  4.1 for further discussion ) .",
    "we fit the optical imaging with one and two - component elliptical srsic models .",
    "these fits , shown in figure 2 , were performed by fitting two - dimensional models convolved with an empirical point spread function ( psf ) using a custom software package as described in seth  ( 2006 ) .",
    "the psf ( @xmath33 subsampled ) was derived from point sources in the images .",
    "the fits were performed on a 5@xmath345  image centered on the ucd , with the background galaxy gradient from m60 itself removed .",
    "the fits are not very sensitive to the fitting box size .    from the residual map ( figure 2 ) , it is clear that a single srsic component provides a poor fit .",
    "in particular , the ellipticity of m60-ucd1 becomes more circular at larger radii , leaving a residual along the minor axis .",
    "the radial shape of the surface brightness profile is also poorly fit .",
    "however , using a two - component srsic model , a very good fit ( @xmath35=1.07 in @xmath21 ) is obtained .",
    "table  1 gives the parameters for the single and double srsic @xmath21 band fits and the double srsic @xmath22 fits .",
    "for the two - component fits the srsic parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are very similar between the filters . because the @xmath21 band provides a much better fit ( probably due to psf modeling issues in @xmath22 ) , all structural values cited are from the @xmath21 fits .    for the best - fit two - component model ,",
    "the inner component is compact ( @xmath38 pc ) , with modest ellipticity ( @xmath39 ) , and has about 58% of the total luminosity of m60-ucd1 .",
    "the outer component is more extended ( @xmath40 pc ) , round , and with a nearly exponential profile ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the overall half - light radius is @xmath28 pc , empirically measured using the deconvolved @xmath21 surface brightness profile .",
    "this value is similar to the radius derived from the single component srsic fit ; within this radius we estimate @xmath42 .",

    "this value is @xmath73 .",
    "the radial velocity of m60-ucd1 is @xmath74 ; the systemic velocity of m60 is 1117 ( gonzlez 1993 ) .",
    "we estimate a dynamical mass for m60-ucd1 using the virial theorem : @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is a parameter that depends on the structure of the galaxy and is smaller for more concentrated systems ; @xmath77 is the integrated velocity dispersion within @xmath37 . following the results of cappellari  ( 2006 ) for a range of srsic profiles , we assume @xmath78 , intermediate between the applicable values for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 profiles ( corresponding to the inner and outer components respectively ) .",
    "we further estimate that @xmath81 , slightly higher than the measured value of @xmath82 , by integrating over our deimos extraction window ( 1.2  @xmath34 1.0 ) and accounting for seeing .",
    "the dynamical mass determined in this manner is @xmath83 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are significant : we have assumed isotropy , sphericity , and mass - follows - light .",
    "dividing this dynamical mass by the total luminosity of m60-ucd1 yields a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "the flexible stellar population synthesis models of conroy  ( 2009 ) , using padova isochrones and a kroupa initial mass function ( imf ) , predict @xmath84 ( 3.5 , 4.2 , 4.7 ) for solar metallicity and ages of ( 8,10,12 ) gyr , respectively ( 5.9 , 7.0 , 7.9 ) for these ages , an increase of nearly 70% in stellar mass over a kroupa imf . ] . if m60-ucd1 has a younger age , the dynamical @xmath10 could imply an elevation in low - mass stars or stellar remnants over kroupa imf model predictions . for older ages",
    "there is an excellent match between the observed @xmath10 and the model predictions . as discussed in  3.3 , a modest increase in the central velocity dispersion ( and hence @xmath85 )",
    "could also be caused by the presence of a supermassive black hole with a mass @xmath86% of that of the ucd ( mieske  2013 ) .",
    "dark matter is not expected to contribute to the @xmath85 (  4.2 ) .",
    "m60-ucd1 is marginally resolved in our deimos observations , and so some spatially - resolved kinematic information is available .",
    "the 5  slitlet was aligned close to the major axis of the object . using the sky - subtracted two - dimensional spectrum",
    ", we determined the radial velocity and velocity dispersion on a pixel - by - pixel basis ( one pixel is @xmath87 ) . there is clear rotation present , with an amplitude of @xmath88 km s@xmath6 to a projected radius of @xmath89 .",
    "a decline of comparable amplitude in the velocity dispersion is also observed . since the radial profiles are strongly affected by seeing ,",
    "we do not attempt dynamical modeling . however , these data provide motivation to obtain improved kinematic maps in the future using integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "we constrain the stellar populations of m60-ucd1 using our mmt / hectospec spectrum ( with its wide wavelength range ) and the models of conroy & van dokkum ( 2012a ; with additions from conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) .",
    "these are stellar population synthesis models with variable abundance ratios for 11 elements .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo method is used to simultaneously fit the entire available optical spectrum .",
    "the derived values are listed in table 2 .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are solely statistical , and do not include the substantial systematic uncertainties necessarily present in any integrated - light study of stellar populations .",
    "the rms residuals in the fit were @xmath90% over most of the spectrum .",
    "the formal age is @xmath91 gyr , indicating an old stellar population .",
    "m60-ucd1 is of solar metallicity with a mild elevation in [ @xmath92/fe ] over solar .",
    "the abundances for c , o , and @xmath92-elements appear very similar to the mean values for high-@xmath93 local early - type galaxies determined in a similar manner ( conroy  2013 ) .",
    "however , the abundance of n is unusual : it is strongly enhanced , with [ n / fe@xmath94\\sim+0.6 $ ] , comparable to the average value observed in globular clusters ( e.g. , briley  2004 ) .",
    "the high abundance of n in globular clusters is generally attributed to self - enrichment by the winds of asymptotic giant branch stars ( gratton  2012 ) .",
    "our results suggest light - element self - enrichment may also be present in ucds , presumably related to their high stellar densities .",
    "we note [ na / fe ] varies strongly with @xmath93 in early - type galaxies , increasing from @xmath95 to @xmath96 for @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "the m60-ucd1 abundance ( [ na / fe@xmath94\\sim+0.4 $ ] ) is therefore difficult to interpret : it could be expected , or could represent a large enhancement over baseline .",
    "as a check on these values , we performed a standard lick index analysis using ez_ages ( graves & schiavon 2008 ) .",
    "these values are also listed in table 2 , and the same caveats apply .",
    "this analysis gave a formal age of @xmath9911 gyr and similar abundance values for most of the elements in common with the full - spectrum analysis ( c , ca , mg , fe ) .",
    "for n the ez_ages analysis does not yield a reliable value , as the cn index strength is off the grids .",
    "the lick cn@xmath100 index for m60-ucd1 ( 0.24 mag ) is comparable to that in most metal - rich m31 globular clusters , which are also thought to be self - enriched ( schiavon  2012 ) .",
    "the very high abundance of n appears to be a robust conclusion of the analysis .",

    "the central astrometric matching between the @xmath114 and @xmath115 data is excellent due to the large x - ray binary and globular cluster populations of m60 , with an rms scatter of 0.17 .",
    "this x - ray source , termed xid 144 by luo  ( 2013 ) , has a position consistent with the optical center of m60-ucd1 .",
    "there is evidence that it is variable , with its x - ray luminosity ( from 0.3 to 8 kev ) ranging from @xmath116 to @xmath117 erg / s over timescales as short as a few months .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well - fit by a absorbed power - law with a photon index of 1.8 .",
    "there are two reasonable possibilities for this central x - ray source : it could either be an active galactic nucleus associated with a massive black hole or a low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "the case for a central black hole is straightforward .",
    "if the black hole occupation fraction of dwarf galaxies is high , and if ucds are the products of tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies , then a significant fraction of ucds should have  overmassive \" black holes that could be detected through dynamical or accretion signatures .",
    "if ucds have been stripped of 99% or more of their original mass ( we estimate in  4.2 that the progenitor of m60-ucd1 was @xmath118200 times more massive ) , then they could host supermassive black holes that are @xmath7% of their present - day masses ( mieske  2013 ) .",
    "frank  ( 2011 ) constrain a putative black hole to be @xmath119 of the total mass of one fornax cluster ucd through integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity would be consistent with a @xmath120 black hole accreting at @xmath121 of the eddington rate with a radiative efficiency of @xmath122 .",
    "this eddington ratio of @xmath123 would be typical of nuclei with old stellar populations ( ho 2009 ) .",
    "we can also estimate the odds that m60-ucd1 contains a bright x - ray binary .",
    "sivakoff  ( 2007 ) derive formulae to estimate the probability that a globular cluster contains a low - mass x - ray binary with @xmath124 erg / s .",
    "the odds are higher for metal - rich clusters and those with high encounter rates . applying their results , but extrapolating to the fainter luminosity observed ,",
    "suggests a @xmath125% chance of having observed a low - mass x - ray binary in m60-ucd1 .",
    "however , these results are of uncertain relevance for an object with a different structure and formation history than a globular cluster ( since what is pertinent is the integrated  not instantaneous  collision rate ) .",
    "dabringhausen  ( 2012 ) suggest ucds have a lower occurrence of low - mass x - ray binaries than expected on the basis of the sivakoff  ( 2007 ) results .",
    "future observations can help clarify the nature of the x - ray source .",
    "for example , if m60-ucd1 hosts a @xmath126 black hole that lies on the radio  x - ray fundamental plane for black holes ( plotkin  2012 ) , it should be detectable with the very large array .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of log @xmath127 vs.  log @xmath128 for dispersion - supported stellar systems .",
    "@xmath127 is the mean surface luminosity density within @xmath37 .",
    "globular clusters are plotted with different symbols than galaxies .",
    "it is clear that m60-ucd1 is an unusual object : it is much denser than any other object classified as a galaxy .",
    "it is more massive than any ucd or star cluster of comparable size , but is much more compact than other galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "m60-ucd1 is not the densest stellar system known .",
    "that honor goes to any of a number of nuclear star clusters , which can reach mean surface densities of @xmath129 pc@xmath130 within @xmath37 ( walcher  2005 ; these are not plotted in figure 3 ) .",
    "many massive globular clusters are also extremely dense .",
    "however , m60-ucd1 is arguably the densest _ galaxy _ known in the local universe . using the @xmath10 from  3.2.1",
    ", its mean effective surface density is @xmath131 pc@xmath130 , a factor of 2.53 higher than for m32 .",
    "the inner component of m60-ucd1 , with @xmath132 pc , has a mean @xmath133 pc@xmath130 , comparable to that of many nuclear star clusters .",
    "the central volume density of m60-ucd1 is not well - constrained by the present data .",
    "the object most similar to m60-ucd1 is hucd1 , a hydra cluster ucd , which has @xmath134 pc and @xmath135 ( misgeld  2011 ) , though m59co ( chilingarian & mamon 2008 ) and several coma cluster ucds ( chiboucas  2011 ) are also similar , if less extreme .",
    "it seems likely that ongoing surveys for ucds will turn up additional objects with properties comparable to m60-ucd1 .      the extreme mass , multiple structural components , high metallicity , and possible presence of a central black hole make it unlikely that m60-ucd1 is a star cluster or merged cluster complex .",
    "it is most plausible that the object is the tidally - stripped remnant of a more massive progenitor galaxy .",
    "pfeffer & baumgardt ( 2013 ) present new simulations of the formation of ucds through tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies in a massive , virgo - like cluster .",
    "they show that it is possible to reproduce the sizes and luminosities of typical ucds .",
    "these simulations were not intended to match the most massive ucds , and hence are not directly comparable to the properties of m60-ucd1 . however , a general conclusion from this study is relevant : the nucleus is largely unaffected by the stripping process , so the inner core of the resultant ucd should have similar properties to the original nucleus .",
    "the inner component of m60-ucd1 has @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath38 pc .",
    "the size , luminosity , and red color are similar to nuclei in the virgo galaxies ngc 4379 and ngc 4387 ( ct  2006 ) and the fornax cluster galaxies ngc 1389 and ic 2006 ( turner  2012 ) .",
    "these galaxies have @xmath138 to @xmath12 and stellar masses @xmath139@xmath140 .",
    "we conclude that m60-ucd1 could have originated in the tidal stripping of a virgo galaxy in this luminosity range .",
    "since the present luminosity of m60-ucd1 is @xmath141 , we infer that it is a factor of @xmath118200 less massive because of the stripping .",
    "the projected distance of m60-ucd1 from the center of m60 ( @xmath23 kpc ) is consistent with the small pericenter needed for efficient stripping ( pfeffer & baumgardt 2013 ) .",
    "galaxies in this mass range host significant globular cluster populations ( @xmath142100 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) that would also be stripped during ucd formation and might still be detectable in phase space ( e.g. , romanowsky  2012 ) .",
    "we caution that ucds may originate in a biased subset of host galaxies that have been largely destroyed , so it is possible that there is no correspondence between ucd progenitors and a subpopulation of surviving galaxies .",
    "the pfeffer & baumgardt ( 2013 ) simulations show that extended debris suggestive of tidal stripping becomes challenging to observe after relatively short ( @xmath139 gyr ) timescales , so the lack of evidence for such debris in figure 2 does not disfavor this scenario .",
    "the dynamical friction timescale ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) for m60-ucd1 is @xmath143 gyr , so it is plausible that its progenitor was stripped long ago and the remnant has  stalled \" at its current radius . in this case",
    "no observable tidal tails would be expected .",
    "the stellar density of m60-ucd1 is much higher than expected for dark matter with a standard nfw profile ( a factor of @xmath144 for even for extreme , cluster - scale halo masses ; tollerud  2011 ) .",
    "if the galaxy has undergone as much tidal stripping as inferred , this is likely to have strongly modified the dark matter profile ; nonetheless , m60-ucd1 is probably the worst ucd in which to search for dark matter . as discussed by willman & strader ( 2012",
    "; see also hilker  2007 ) , the ucds most likely to show evidence for dark matter are the least massive and most extended ucds .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a remarkable ultra - compact dwarf galaxy around the massive virgo elliptical galaxy ngc 4649 ( m60 ) , which we term m60-ucd1 . with a dynamical mass of @xmath0 but a half - light radius of only @xmath1 pc , m60-ucd1 is more massive than any ultra - compact dwarfs of comparable size , and is arguably the densest galaxy known in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> it has a two - component structure well - fit by a sum of srsic functions , with an elliptical , compact ( @xmath2 pc ; @xmath3 ) inner component and a round , exponential , extended ( @xmath4 pc ) outer component . </S>",
    "<S> _ chandra _ data reveal a variable central x - ray source with @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 that could be an active galactic nucleus associated with a massive black hole or a low - mass x - ray binary . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of optical spectroscopy shows the object to be old ( @xmath7 gyr ) and of solar metallicity , with elevated [ mg / fe ] and strongly enhanced [ n / fe ] that indicates light - element self - enrichment ; such self - enrichment may be generically present in dense stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity dispersion ( @xmath8 ) and resulting dynamical mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath9 ) are consistent with  </S>",
    "<S> but slightly higher than </S>",
    "<S>  expectations for an old , metal - rich stellar population with a kroupa initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a massive black hole or a mild increase in low - mass stars or stellar remnants is therefore also consistent with this @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar density of the galaxy is so high that no dynamical signature of dark matter is expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the properties of m60-ucd1 suggest an origin in the tidal stripping of a nucleated galaxy with @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>"
