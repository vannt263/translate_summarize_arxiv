    "the effect of the charged nucleus on the electron wave function is twofold : firstly , the ( initial and final state ) electron momentum @xmath15 is enhanced in the vicinity of the nucleus due to the attractive electrostatic potential , i.e. , the wave length of the electron is becoming shorter near the nucleus .",
    "secondly , the attractive potential of the nucleus leads to a focusing of the electron wave function in the nuclear region .",

    "we point out that the discussion presented above is a most general one as long as detailed properties of the nuclear current are ignored .",
    "the hope is of course that the presence of , e.g. , 208 nucleons in a @xmath10pb nucleus leads to a smooth nucleon momentum distribution , such that the features of the individual nucleon wave functions are averaged out to some degree in the momentum regime relevant for our discussion .",
    "calculations in the framework of the eikonal approximation as presented in @xcite , but with the electron amplitudes adapted to the amplitudes from exact calculations , also agree well with the ema , a fact which supports the assumption that a semiclassical description of coulomb corrections can be found at high momentum transfer .",

    "we therefore present results for a pb model nucleus consisting of 82 scalar protons with harmonic nucleon wave functions for some typical kinematical situations , which indeed show that the modified ema , using an average potential value , reproduces the coulomb effects with high accuracy for @xmath1 scattering , if the momentum transfer and the energy of the outgoing electron are high enough .",

    "a detailed study using relativistic nucleon wave functions including spin in conjunction with more realistic current models will be presented in detail in a forthcoming paper .    at the lowest energies that have been used in the positron experiment by guye et al .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , for an initial electron energy @xmath153 mev and initial positron energy @xmath154 mev , the situation is a bit more involved , and we found a relatively large disagreement between the exact inclusive cross sections and the values calculated from the ema with an effective potential value of @xmath155 mev , as will be demonstrated below .",

    "it also captures the most important features of the @xmath1 cross sections in the vicinity of the quasielastic peak .",
    "furthermore , it has to be pointed out that the ohio group used a single particle shell model , where the nucleon wave functions were obtained by solving the dirac equation for each shell nucleon with phenomenological s - v - potentials . but",
    "a comparison of measured data and calculations shows large discrepancies especially at higher energy transfer @xmath193 mev , where correlation effects and pion production become increasingly important .",

    "binding energies are indeed neglected in our theoretical model , a shift of the quasielastic peak by about @xmath200 mev to lower energy transfer is observed .",
    "it is very instructive to investigate the total response function @xmath201 , which is defined in plane wave born approximation by @xmath202 via the well - known mott cross section @xmath203 not only for the total cross section , but also for individual filled shells . according to eq .",
    "( [ ratioq ] ) , the mott cross section remains unchanged when it gets multiplied by the ema focusing factors and the momentum transfer @xmath204 is replaced by its corresponding effective value .",
    "therefore , if the ema is a good approximation , the cross section can be written ( see also @xcite ) @xmath205    table 1 shows ratios of total responses , which have been obtained by dividing the same mott cross section out of the inclusive coulomb corrected , ema- , and pwba - cross sections restricted to single closed shells .",
