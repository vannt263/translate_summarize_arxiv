    "experimental and theoretical studies of the emission of the h@xmath7 radiative dissociation continuum ( @xmath0 electronic transition ) have a long and interesting history .",
    "they were stimulated by molecular spectroscopy and quantum chemistry @xcite , investigations of hydrogen containing plasmas @xcite and astrophysics @xcite . since the first work of houtermans @xcite",
    "the @xmath0 transition has been studied as a possible laser system ( see @xcite and refs .  therein ) .",
    "it is widely used in uv and vuv light sources @xcite .    in spite of numerous studies ,",
    "the h@xmath7 continuum emission was never used or even proposed to be used for a determination of plasma parameters , i.e. , for spectroscopic plasma diagnostics .",
    "it seems to be rather strange because , on one hand , diagnostics of hydrogen - containing plasmas is not trivial and every opportunity should be tried ; on the other hand , emission spectroscopy due to its passive nature and instrumental simplicity is of primary interest for various studies in plasma physics and industrial applications .",
    "moreover the visible spectrum of hydrogen plasma gives us in principle only three qualitatively different sources of information : ( 1 ) atomic lines of balmer series , ( 2 ) band ( actually multi - line ) spectrum of h@xmath7 , and ( 3 ) the continuum .",
    "first two are successfully used in plasma diagnostics , while the third one was never even tried .",
    "previous investigators only measured the continuum intensity and sometimes made certain calculations for comparison with an experiment @xcite .",
    "it should be underlined that those calculations are solutions of so - called direct problem of spectroscopy ( from known plasma parameters to observable spectrum ) .",
    "it is obvious that any observable property of plasma is somehow connected with values of plasma parameters and therefore in principle may be tried to be used as a diagnostic tool .",
    "however actually , as a rule , one observable quantity is determined by several different plasma parameters . then the key point is to study the informational content of experimental data and to find the proper way of data analysis .",
    "the last one is always an inversion problem ( from an observed spectrum to unknown plasma parameters ) having its own specifics ( see below section [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "the main goal of the present work was to investigate the possibility to use h@xmath7 continuum intensity for diagnostics of non - equilibrium plasmas .",
    "our decision to make the first steps in this direction was based on following _ a priory _ considerations .",
    "the experimental data on the continuum intensity may be considered as two different sources of information : the relative spectral distribution and the total absolute intensity of the continuum .",
    "the first one is directly connected with the population density distribution over vibrational levels of the @xmath15 state . in low pressure plasmas the levels are populated predominantly by direct electron impact excitation and the deactivation is mainly due to spontaneous emission @xcite . in this case",
    "the relation between the vibrational population density distributions in excited and ground electronic states should be obtained within corona - like models .",
    "so the shape of the continuum should be usable for a determination of the vibrational density distribution ( or at least the vibrational temperature ) of the ground state of h@xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand every act of the continuum emission leads to a dissociation of a hydrogen molecule .",
    "therefore , an absolute value of the continuum intensity is directly connected with the rate of radiative dissociation via the @xmath15 state and also may be used for an estimation of the total rate of electron impact dissociation .",
    "our intention was to investigate both opportunities and to check them experimentally .",
    "therefore the present work includes two closely connected tasks ( development of new methods and their test in certain real plasma conditions ) and two groups of results connected with the proposed methods and with non - equilibrium plasma of the discharges under the study .    the first part is based on the analysis and description of :    1 .",
    "excitation - deactivation kinetics and derivation of suitable formulas ( sections [ sec : contintpop ] , [ sec : excdeacbaleq ] , [ sec : dettv ] , [ sec : dissrate ] ) ; 2 .",
    "rate constants of various collisional and radiative transitions to establish certain sets of recommended data ( section [ sec : constants ] ) ; 3 .   experimental technique reproducible by other researchers ( section [ sec : experiment ] ) ; 4 .",
    "various ways of data processing ( section [ sec : contintpop ] and throughout the paper ) .    that made it possible to develop two new methods of diagnostics of : ( 1 ) the ground @xmath1 state vibrational temperature @xmath2 from the relative intensity distribution , and ( 2 ) the rate of electron impact dissociation from the absolute intensity of the continuum . the known method of determination of @xmath2 from relative intensities of fulcher-@xmath4 bands was seriously corrected and simplified due to the revision of @xmath5 transition probabilities and cross sections of @xmath16 electron impact excitation .    for tests of the methods we performed the studies of emission spectra of two quite different plasma sources : ( 1 ) pure hydrogen dc capillary - arc ( section [ sec : dc ] ) , and ( 2 ) h@xmath7+ar microwave discharges ( section [ sec : mw ] )",
    "the first one is known to produce bright pure hydrogen spectrum and was already investigated spectroscopically @xcite from fulcher-@xmath4 band intensities in @xcite almost failed , because of insufficient precision of intensity measurements ( errors @xmath17 10% ) . ] . therefore it was chosen as an example of a simple model system for determination of @xmath2 by two different methods presented above .    the second one has been specially designed for basic research on molecular microwave discharges mainly based on spectroscopic diagnostic methods @xcite .",
    "microwave plasma reactors of this planar type have been used for various plasma technological applications @xcite . frequently h@xmath7 and ar",
    "are used as main components of the feed gas mixture leading to an essential interest on h@xmath7 dissociation processes and on influences of ar admixture on h@xmath7 emission .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in the conclusion .",
    "the dissociation continuum of the hydrogen molecule is caused by spontaneous transitions from the upper bound @xmath15 electronic state to the lower @xmath18 repulsive state .",
    "the spectral distribution @xmath19 of the continuum intensity ( number of quanta emitted within unit range of wavelengths per unit volume and per second in all directions ) is related to the population densities @xmath20 of the excited @xmath21 vibronic levels , as @xmath22 where @xmath23  wavelength , @xmath24  vibrational quantum number , @xmath25 the total population density of the upper vibronic state , @xmath26  populations of @xmath27 electronic - vibro - rotational levels ( their very small triplet splitting may be neglected ) , @xmath28  rotational quantum number of the total angular momentum excluding electron spin , and @xmath29  spectral distribution of the spontaneous emission transition probability ( einstein coefficients for various wavelengths of @xmath30 transitions ) . we have neglected the rather small effect of vibro - rotation interaction and assume the transition probabilities being independent on @xmath28 .    for h@xmath7 molecule the values of @xmath29 should be considered as well - known nowadays because they have been calculated in several works @xcite and checked experimentally @xcite , being in rather good agreement @xcite .",
    "we used the results of @xcite shown in table  [ tab : alv ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the data are visualized for the transitions from @xmath21=0 - 3 levels for @xmath31  nm .",
    "one may see that the probability of transitions from various vibronic levels has maxima in different wavelength regions due to oscillatory behavior of the vibrational wave functions of the upper state .",
    "so the spectral distribution of the continuum intensity @xmath19 may have a certain informational content about the population density distribution over vibrational levels of the @xmath15 electronic state . in principle",
    ", measurements of the intensity @xmath19 may be used for the determination of the populations @xmath20 in relative or even in absolute scale by eq .",
    "( [ eq : iab ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that even this very first stage of the data processing belongs to the class of so - called reverse ( or inversion ) problems , which are known to be not well - posed ( sometimes they are called `` ill - posed '' ) .",
    "the final result  a certain set of the populations @xmath20  depends ( in principle ) not only on the values of the actual populations in plasma , but may be influenced by so - called _ a priory _ information : the number of adjusted parameters ( @xmath20 ) , the number of experimental data points , the experimental errors and even the algorithm of data processing .    in the present work we used for the solution of this and other reverse problems the least - square fitting , i.e. , the minimization of the functional @xmath32 in the multidimensional space of parameters @xmath33 used in a theoretical model .",
    "here @xmath34 , @xmath35  calculated and experimental data , @xmath36  total number of data points , @xmath37  number of adjusted parameters , @xmath38  standard deviations of the experimental data .",
    "the standard deviations of optimal values of the adjusted parameters may be estimated as square roots of diagonal terms of the covariance matrix @xcite .",
    "we used a minimization algorithm analogous to a linear regression @xcite with the following substitutions : @xmath39 from experiment , @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : iab ] ) , @xmath41 corresponding to 7% random experimental error of the measurement , @xmath42 , @xmath43 was varied in the range @xmath44  nm .",
    "experimental errors were estimated by averaging of several measurements for the same conditions in plasma .",
    "they are mainly caused by random noise , non - sufficient stability of the discharges during the experiments and restricted reproducibility .",
    "the value of @xmath45 had to be adjusted in such a way that reliable results can be obtained from the minimization procedure .",
    "the values of @xmath29 from table  [ tab : alv ] were interpolated by cubic splines .",
    "the populations of @xmath20 may be sometimes interesting themselves ( see the examples below ) .",
    "but on the other hand , in non - equilibrium plasmas the rovibronic level populations in excited electronic states are connected with those in the ground electronic state by the excitation - deactivation balance equation for the electronically excited @xmath46 rovibronic levels @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48  the rate of secondary excitation processes ( cascades , recombination and so forth ) ; @xmath49  radiative lifetime of the @xmath50 level ; @xmath51  effective lifetime describing the decay of the @xmath50 level due to quenching in collisions of the excited molecule with electrons , atoms and unexcited molecules .",

    "this most simple limit case ( often called corona or corona - like model ) is that of low - pressure plasmas with small input power . under such conditions",
    "the levels are predominantly excited by direct electron impact excitation and their decay is mainly due to spontaneous emission .",
    "state due to cascades from @xmath58 and @xmath59 states was taken into account in @xcite and found to be less than 20% .",
    "the radiative and collisional quenching lifetimes are estimated to be equal at 3 mbar for @xmath15 and at 0.75 mbar for @xmath59 states ( see @xcite ) . ]",
    "than the second terms in right and left hand parts of eq .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) may be omitted .",
    "it may be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nav ] ) and ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) that even in the most favorable case for plasma diagnostics the populations @xmath60 depend not only on the distribution @xmath61 .",
    "radiative transition probabilities , lifetimes and electron impact cross sections for single rovibronic levels and transitions should be known as well as the electron energy distribution function .",
    "moreover the determination of @xmath61 from measured @xmath60 and with the certain system of equations ( [ eq : nav ] ) for various @xmath24 and @xmath28 lead to a reverse problem .",
    "further simplification of the model may be achieved by detailed analysis of radiative and collision transition probabilities and lifetimes .",
    "we are interested in determination of the vibrational temperature @xmath2 from the continuum intensity ( @xmath62 ) and from the intensities of q - branch lines of fulcher-@xmath4 bands ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "derivation from fulcher-@xmath4 bands was originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "it included measurements of q - line intensities , @xmath57 and gas temperature @xmath64 .",
    "it was based on rather old data about radiative lifetimes ( see @xcite ) and the cross sections of the @xmath6 electron impact excitation from @xcite .",
    "our analysis show that the data should be revised and the method sufficiently simplified ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : slvtv ] ) , ( [ eq : ndv ] ) and the discussion ) . ]",
    "therefore we have to analyze all available data about electron impact excitation and spontaneous decay of the upper levels .    the transition probabilities for @xmath65=1 @xmath10 @xmath66=1 transitions [ q1 lines of @xmath67 fulcher-@xmath4 bands ]",
    "were obtained semi - empirically in the framework of the adiabatic approximation with corresponding dipole moment obtained in @xcite from experimental data about wave numbers , branching ratios in @xmath68-progressions and radiative lifetimes .",
    "the results for the first seven diagonal ( @xmath24=@xmath68=@xmath69 ) bands are presented in table  [ tab : fta ] together with semi - empirically predicted @xcite and experimental values of radiative lifetimes @xcite .",
    "one may see a noticeable discrepancy between semi - empirical and experimental lifetimes of @xmath70=4 - 6 , @xmath28=1 rovibronic levels due to non - adiabatic effects neglected in the adiabatic approximation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , only the first four diagonal bands may be used for the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand this effect did not influence the values of the rotational temperatures derived from the populations of @xmath713 levels in @xcite .",
    "it may be considered as an indication , that the rate of the additional decay , associated with a non - adiabatic coupling of the vibronic levels lying above the h(@xmath72=1 ) + h(@xmath72=2 ) dissociation limit , is almost independent on @xmath28 ( here @xmath72 is the principle quantum number ) .",
    "it seems quite reasonable , if the perturbation is due to an electron - rotational interaction with a continuum ( the hypothesis proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "because of the lack of information about @xmath28dependences of the transition probabilities and the lifetimes they will be considered herein as independent on the rotational quantum number in accordance with an adiabatic approximation .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of @xmath21 vibronic states of h@xmath7 have been studied in numerous works both experimentally @xcite and by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "all available data are collected in table  [ tab : tv ] .",
    "one may see , that :    nothing is known about @xmath28dependences of the lifetimes , so we again have to assume independence on @xmath28 .",
    "experimental data are obtained only for low vibronic states .",
    "the experimental and calculated data are in very good accordance for @xmath73 , but for higher @xmath24 only _ ab initio _ data are available .    to be in consistence with the transition probabilities listed in table  [ tab : alv ] we have used values of @xmath74 marked in table  [ tab : tv ] as `` p.w . ''  present work .",
    "the lifetimes for @xmath73 were obtained by the integration of the tabulated values of the transition probabilities from table  [ tab : alv ] .",
    "the values labeled with an asterisk for @xmath75 were obtained by extrapolating the lifetimes with the help of a third order polynomial fit of the data from @xcite and a constant factor obtained from the average value of the ratios with our values for @xmath73.2 one can see in table  [ tab : alv ] that some quantity of transition probability resides below the lower table margin of @xmath76  nm . therefore , the calculation of the @xmath74 from the tabulated @xmath29 values would lead to an overestimation of the lifetimes . ]",
    "the dependences of @xmath77,0,@xmath78 electron impact excitation on the incident electron energy have been studied in @xcite .",
    "they have a normal form for singlet - triplet transitions : a sharp increase from the threshold to the maximum and a rather sharp decrease for higher energies .",
    "the data of @xcite are in good accordance and in @xcite they were used for the extraction of the cross sections for different @xmath24 from rate coefficients and @xmath57 measured in @xcite .",
    "the relative cross sections @xmath79 in maximum are shown in table  [ tab:2 ] together with corresponding ratios of the franck - condon factors calculated in @xcite .",
    "one may see noticeable deviation of measured values from those calculated in the franck - condon approximation . in @xcite",
    "this discrepancy was interpreted as an evidence of a remarkable dependence of the scattering amplitude on the internuclear distance ( non - franck - condon effect ) .",
    "later the data from @xcite have been used for the determination of the complete set of the cross sections for various @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "it is important to take into account that the relative cross sections in @xcite are based on radiative transition probabilities and lifetimes obtained in adiabatic approximation ( almost the same as in table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "as we already mentioned above the lifetimes of @xmath82 are in contradiction with such extrapolation .",
    "new data about @xmath83 and @xmath84 from table  [ tab : fta ] should be used for the determination of the cross sections from the line intensities measured in @xcite .",
    "we made the recalculation and got the data presented in the sixth column of table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "one may see that they are in rather good agreement with corresponding ratios of franck - condon factors .",
    "it means that the dependence of the scattering amplitude on the internuclear distance is negligible in the case of the @xmath85 electron impact excitation of h@xmath7 .",
    "this is in accordance with recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "nothing is known , so far as we know , about the cross sections for the @xmath86 excitation .",
    "therefore , for both @xmath85 and @xmath87 transitions we assume that the rate coefficients of the electron impact excitation have non - zero values only for @xmath88 rovibronic transitions .",
    "they are considered as independent on @xmath78 and proportional to corresponding franck - condon factors , i.e. , @xmath89 thus neglecting the momentum transfer in electron impact excitation @xcite and the rather small dependence of the rate coefficients on @xmath57 .",
    "we used the only values of franck - condon factors for @xmath85 and @xmath90 transitions which had been calculated in @xcite ( tables  [ tab : fcf1 ] and  [ tab : fcf2 ] ) .",
    "vibrational and rotational energies are not well separated in the ground electronic state of h@xmath7 because of the small mass of the nuclei .",
    "just to have a certain ability to characterize the distribution over vibrational levels we introduce the vibrational temperature by @xmath91 } \\cdot \\exp{\\bigl(-\\frac{\\delta e_{xv}}{kt_{\\text{vib}}}\\bigr ) } \\cdot ( 2n+1 ) \\cdot \\exp{\\bigl(-\\frac{\\delta e_{xvn}}{kt}\\bigr ) } } { \\sum\\limits_{v } \\exp{\\bigl(-\\frac{\\delta e_{xv}}{kt_{\\text{vib}}}\\bigr ) } \\ \\sum\\limits_{n } ( 2n+1 ) \\cdot \\exp{\\bigl(-\\frac{\\delta e_{xvn}}{kt}\\bigr ) } } = \\mbox{[h$_{2}$ ] } \\cdot \\frac{\\exp{\\bigl(-\\frac{\\delta e_{xv}}{kt_{\\text{vib}}}\\bigr)}}{{\\mathcal p}(t_{\\text{vib}})},\\ ] ] where [ h@xmath7 ]  total concentration of molecules , @xmath93 , @xmath94  vibrational and rotational energy differences , @xmath2 and @xmath64  vibrational and translational temperatures , @xmath95  the vibrational partition function .",
    "so we assume that in all vibrational levels of the @xmath1 state the populations of the rotational levels are in boltzmann equilibrium with the gas temperature @xmath64 .",
    "taking into account all the assumptions discussed above , the balance equation ( [ eq : balance ] ) may be written for the populations of @xmath70 vibronic states after summation over rotational levels in the following form @xmath96    one may see that the determination of @xmath2 may be achieved by numerical solution of the system of equations ( [ eq : slvtv ] ) ) .",
    "that means at least three relative populations ( [ eq : ndv ] ) , and therefore three equations ( [ eq : slvtv ] ) can be used for derivation of one unknown ( @xmath2 ) . ] for several levels @xmath24 with experimental data about @xmath97 derived from the intensities of the fulcher-@xmath4 q - branch lines of diagonal ( @xmath98 ) bands : @xmath99 this method of the @xmath2 determination is based on sufficiently simple kinetics model and certain set of constants presented in tables [ tab : fta ] and [ tab : fcf2 ] .",
    "it is even more simple then the predecessor @xcite because it needs only intensity measurements .    in the framework of our model",
    "the continuum intensity can be written as @xmath100    to be able to work with relative intensities we may introduce the normalized relative intensity @xmath101 which is equal to unity for @xmath102 .    the normalized intensities ( [ eq : inorm ] ) may be tabulated for various values of @xmath2 and then may be used for a determination of the vibrational temperature by least squares fitting ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) of experimental and calculated continuum intensity distributions .",
    "the results of our calculations for @xmath103  nm and @xmath2 = 0 , 3000 and 5000  k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probab7 ] .",
    "one may see that a variation of vibrational temperature leads to certain change in the shape of the continuum intensity distribution .",
    "most sensitive are the wavelength regions near @xmath104 and 300  nm .",
    "the first one is out of our range of observation and can not be used for diagnostics herein .",
    "nevertheless the fact should be considered as one of the results of our present work .",
    "it may be recommended for vuv spectroscopy if the problems of the sensitivity calibration in this difficult region would be solved somehow ( with the use of synchrotron radiation , for example ) .",
    "the changes near @xmath105  nm are less pronounced , therefore they may be used in the following way .    when the vibrational temperature is sufficiently low and @xmath106 then the excitation from vibronic levels with @xmath107 may be neglected and @xmath108 represents the shape of the continuum for @xmath109 .",
    "it does not depend on discharge conditions and may be easily calculated because molecular constants in eq .",

    "its zero value corresponds to the limit case of total independence of the parameters , while @xmath137 means that the parameter @xmath138 may be expressed as a linear combination of the other parameters and therefore the number of adjusted parameters should be decreased .",

    "this is most probably caused by large values of gas temperature and concentration of atomic hydrogen that is favorable for the acceleration of the vt - relaxation . on the other hand this behavior",
    "can also be explained by our model , since there is a certain upper limit above which the continuum intensity distribution is no longer sensitive to an increase of vibrational temperature ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the results of our measurements show that the spectral intensity distribution of the continuum in the h@xmath7+ar microwave discharge has a noticeably different shape compared to that in pure hydrogen .",
    "moreover , the shape was found to depend on the ratio of the components in the mixture ( [ ar]:[h@xmath7 ] ) , which was varied from ( 19:1 ) to ( 1:4 ) under the same total pressure and power input .",

    "two independent spectroscopic methods gave almost the same values of @xmath222  k. the difference between vibrational and gas temperatures is in accordance with previous observations @xcite .    in the h@xmath7+ar microwave plasma for the first time the shape of the h@xmath7 dissociation continuum",
    "was found to depend on the mixture components , significantly influenced by ar@xmath223h@xmath7 excitation transfer processes .",
    "absorption measurements of the population of the 3s@xmath83p@xmath94s levels of ar together with certain computer simulation has been successfully used for verification of the proposed mechanism .",
    "also for the first time the rates of radiative and total electron impact dissociation were obtained for various gas pressures and relative concentrations of the mixture components .",
    "\\1 ) we intended to have an experimental technique as simple as possible and , in particular , to stay on the basis of emission spectroscopy only .",
    "then the methods would be especially useful in various industrial applications including rather easy _ in situ _ control of plasma processing .",
    "the approach has in principle a backside because the knowledge of the actual electron energy distribution function and its spatial distribution may be of importance for a correct extraction of the information about plasma parameters .",
    "langmuir probe measurements of electron energy distributions are not a problem nowadays , even in the cases of space - charge layers @xcite , rf @xcite and microwave discharges ( see @xcite and refs .  therein ) .",
    "we limited ourselves with intensity measurements in the more or less easy detectable near - uv region because the following second restriction of our attempt seems to be more significant .",
    "\\2 ) our analysis of the known characteristics of radiative and collisional processes involved into the mechanism of formation of observable continuum emission led us to the conclusion that in spite of numerous efforts the situation is still unsatisfactory .",
    "therefore , only simple models can be used .",
    "the corona - like model of the excitation , neglecting the rotational structure of upper vibronic levels , and the franck - condon approximation for electron impact excitation are actually available and justified right now .",
    "nevertheless , even in such complicated conditions we were happy to find that more or less accurate measurements of relative and absolute spectral distributions of the continuum intensity may be used for certain estimations of the vibrational temperature , for the analysis of the excitation mechanisms and for getting information about the rate of hydrogen dissociation by electron impact .    the last one looks more prospective because in some cases it can be already used as it is .",
    "if , for example , one is interested in the relative dependence of the electron impact dissociation rate on the position in plasma or on the discharge conditions , the information may be easily obtained just by a measurement of the continuum emission intensity even without any calibrations .",
    "the method of the determination of the absolute rate of the electron impact dissociation may be considerably improved , if the electron energy distribution function would be determined experimentally or calculated somehow .",
    "then there would be no need to use our graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : rc ] but to calculate the values in an explicit way by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "this rather easy and independent method of determination of the absolute values of the rate of electron impact dissociation of hydrogen may be used in gas discharge physics and in plasma chemistry within two approaches .",
    "\\1 ) it may be used for the determination of the hydrogen dissociation degree ( which is often considered as a very important plasma parameter ) , if one is able to determine the effective mean lifetime of atoms in plasma with certain theoretical model of diffusion and association of atoms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "\\2 ) if the value of the dissociation degree is determined by one of the existing methods ( see @xcite ) then the effective lifetime of atoms in plasma may be determined with the help of the rate of dissociation and the corresponding balance equation for atoms .",
    "further improvements of the methods developed in present work need more detailed information about the elementary processes especially those about the cross sections of electronic - vibrational ( better electronic - vibro - rotational ) @xmath86 electron impact excitation and the rate coefficients of the quenching of @xmath27 levels in collisions with electrons , atoms and molecules .",
    "we certainly understand those are not simple problems , but we may hope that the needs of plasma diagnostics and our present work may be considered as some kind of the challenge for our colleagues working in the field of electronic and atomic collision physics .",
