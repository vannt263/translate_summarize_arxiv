    "in their final stages of evolution , both massive ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) and intermediate - mass ( @xmath3 m@xmath2 ) stars can become dust - enshrouded as a result of intense mass loss at rates of @xmath4 up to @xmath5 m@xmath2 yr@xmath6 .",
    "for the massive stars , this heavy mass loss occurs during the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , while for the intermediate - mass stars this happens during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolution .",
    "after having lost a significant fraction of their initial mass during this episode , the photospheric temperature of the star increases again and the stellar ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field starts ionizing the dusty cse , producing either a planetary nebula ( pn ) or a post - rsg nebula surrounding a wolf - rayet star . the mechanisms at play during the short - lasting transition stage between rsg / agb and wr / pn are still poorly known .",
    "especially the final evolution of the massive objects is hitherto poorly documented .",
    "one such massive object is afgl 4106 .",
    "garca - lario et al .",
    "( 1994 ) discovered nebular line emission from the ir object afgl 4106 , which came as a surprise because the central star was thought to be of spectral type g : too cool to ionize a cse .",
    "the dust shell around afgl 4106 was imaged in the infrared ( ir ) by molster et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who modelled the spectral energy distribution as observed by iso with a radiation transfer code .",
    "they provide evidence that the object is a binary consisting of a late - a / early - f type star and a somewhat fainter m - type companion .",
    "their distance estimate yields luminosities too high for agb evolution and hence afgl 4106 must be the result of post - rsg evolution .",
    "here we present and analyse new observations of this object and focus on the spatial distribution and physical conditions of the cse around afgl4106 .",
    "coronographic imaging in h@xmath0 shows the spatial distribution of the ionized material around afgl 4106 .",
    "spatially resolved echelle spectroscopy is performed to measure expansion velocities , electron densities and the internal extinction by the dust .",
    "the spatial distribution of dust extinction and emission is modelled in a consistent way .",
    "finally we discuss the structure of the circumstellar envelope and the recent mass - loss history of afgl 4106 .",
    "on february 4 , 1996 , we used the multi - mode instrument emmi at the eso 3.5 m ntt on la silla , chile , to image afgl 4106 through a filter centred at h@xmath0 , with a rather narrow width of 33   to avoid contamination by [ n  ii ] emission .",
    "because of the high apparent brightness of the star ( 9@xmath7 mag in v ) coronographic techniques were used to limit the saturation of the ccd .",
    "a glass plate was inserted in the aperture wheel , holding six dark blots of different size and attenuation .",
    "the star was placed behind a 1.9@xmath8 blot with a central attenuation of a few mag .",
    "two frames of each 5 min integration time in h@xmath0 were combined . a 10 s exposure through a broad - band johnson r filter",
    "was used to correct for the continuum contribution within the h@xmath0 filter band .",
    "the r - band image was aligned with the h@xmath0 image and scaled linearly by comparing the intensities of several field stars . before subtracting the r - band image from the h@xmath0 image both",
    "were corrected for structure in the instrumental response over the pixels of the ccd by dividing them by images of the morning twilight sky , taken through the corresponding filters .",
    "remaining ccd artifacts and cosmic ray impacts were removed by hand .",
    "the seeing was constant at 1@xmath8 , and the pixel size was 0.268@xmath8 .      on february 4 , 1996 , we used the same telescope and instrument to take echelle spectra of afgl 4106 with several slit orientations .",
    "the wavelength region extended from 6000 to 8350  . using a slit width of 1@xmath8 a resolving power of @xmath9",
    "was obtained corresponding to a velocity resolution of 4 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the slit length was set to 15@xmath8 and the spatial resolution was 0.268@xmath8 per pixel .",
    "we centred the star in the middle of the slit but obtained 15 min spectra with different position angles : 0@xmath10 , 45@xmath10 , 90@xmath10 and 135@xmath10 where the position angle is defined from west over north .",
    "the reduction of the spectra was standard and included flat - fielding , wavelength calibration on the basis of th - ar exposures , spectral response correction on the basis of a measured spectrum of standard star hd 60753 , interactive cosmic hit cleaning , extinction correction with average extinction values , and finally absolute flux calibration .",
    "the seeing was about 0.8 to 0.9@xmath8 .",
    "the coronographic image in h@xmath0 is displayed on a logarithmic flux density scale in fig .  1 .",
    "north is up , and east is to the left .",
    "the star itself is heavily saturated despite the use of the coronographic blot , resulting in the artificial ns - orientated bar .",
    "the absolute flux density calibration was derived from the spectra and is estimated to be accurate within @xmath11% .",

    "afgl 4106 appears to be situated in a bright , spatially extended emission complex . from n to w of the star , the strongest emission delineates a bow - shaped structure much akin the bow - shocks associated with stars that move supersonically through the interstellar medium ( kaper et al .",

    "much less h@xmath0 emission is detected .",
    "interestingly , the 10 @xmath16 m emission ( molster et al .  1999 ) shows a clear anti - correlation with the h@xmath0 emission : the 10 @xmath16 m emission peaks in the se and is faintest in the nw .",

    "the self - absorbed h@xmath0 line profile centred on the star is identical to that observed by garca - lario et al .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath0 emission conditions in the vicinity of the star have been stable over a period of at least six years .",
    "a total of 31 absorption lines of the atomic and singly ionized species fe  i , fe  ii , sc  ii , si  ii , o  i , mg  ii , na  i and n  i were selected for measuring the star s radial velocity . considering a heliocentric correction for the movement of the earth of @xmath19 km s@xmath6 , the heliocentric velocity of the star is determined at @xmath20 km s@xmath6 . for an individual line ,",
    "the typical deviation from the mean was 4 km s@xmath6 , which is equal to the spectral resolution .",

    "the si  ii @xmath226347,6371 , fe  ii @xmath306456 , n  i @xmath307468 and fe  i @xmath308327 absorption lines have asymmetric line profiles , with more absorption in the blue wing . this may be caused by outflowing matter due to present day mass loss .",
    "the spectrum around si  ii @xmath306347 is shown as an example ( fig .",
    "the spectrum was normalised by dividing by a constant equal to the spectrum level outside of the absorption line , i.e.  the spectral slope is not affected . also plotted is the difference between this spectrum , and the spectrum after mirroring with respect to the absorption extremum at 6347.29 (after heliocentric correction ) .",
    "this difference spectrum shows the absorption excess in the blue wing of the line profile , reaching a maximum at a blueshift of @xmath31 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the centroid wavelengths and equivalent widths of 68 diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) were measured .",
    "these dibs are found over the entire spectral coverage , although few are found at wavelengths longer than 7400  .",
    "the dibs were identified using jenniskens & desert ( 1994 ) , from which also the conversion factors between equivalent width and colour excess @xmath32 for each dib were adopted .",
    "the derived colour excess is @xmath33 mag , confirming the estimated @xmath34 mag from a smaller selection of dibs by molster et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to whom we refer for a thorough discussion on the distance to afgl 4106 . the heliocentric velocity is @xmath35 km s@xmath6 . the velocity of the dibs differs significantly from both the velocity of afgl 4106 as measured from the spectra as well as the system velocity of afgl4106 , confirming that the dibs are of interstellar not circumstellar origin .",
    "the [ n  ii ] @xmath306583 line is the strongest emission line in afgl 4106 , and the best tracer of the kinematics of the circumstellar nebula . unlike the h@xmath0",
    ", there is no stellar contribution to the line profile .",
    "the underlying stellar continuum is subtracted by scaling the spatial profile of the stellar spectrum outside the kinematic extend of the [ n  ii ] emission . in this way",
    "a map is constructed of the [ n  ii ] emission as a function of the position along the slit relative to the stellar position , and the heliocentric doppler velocity , for each of the four slit orientations ( fig .",
    "the flux scale is logarithmic , and the relative positions are counted from e to w ( at 0@xmath10 ) , from se to nw ( at 45@xmath10 ) , from s to n ( at 90@xmath10 ) and from sw to ne ( at 135@xmath10 ) .",
    "close to the stellar position the stellar continuum was too dominant over the [ n  ii ] emission to reliably correct for it , and this region in the four maps is covered by the labels with the slit position angles .",
    "the maps of the [ n  ii ] emission are consistent with emission from a radially expanding shell , with an expansion velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath6 and a radius of @xmath37 . as in the h@xmath0 emission map , the nw side is brighter than the se side . the expansion velocity is smaller than the 40 km s@xmath6 derived from the si  ii absorption and also smaller than the @xmath38 km s@xmath6 that we estimate from the @xmath23co j=1@xmath240 emission at 115 ghz detected by josselin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the spectra at the four different position angles were summed and integrated over the blue- and red - shifted velocity range , respectively .",
    "this results in an effective cross section of the spatially extended emission complex running roughly from se to nw , i.e.  from the minimum to the maximum of the emission measure .",
    "the result is plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "5 . assuming that the source of the [ n  ii ] emission is a spherically symmetric expanding shell , the logarithm of the ratio of the blue- over the red - shifted emission corresponds to the optical depth within the emitting shell .",
    "this is because the red - shifted emission corresponds to the far side of the shell and has to traverse through the dusty cse within the shell before it emerges at the observer s side which is also where the blue - shifted emission arises from .",
    "the derived spatial profile of the optical depth is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the optical depth profile traces the dusty cse out to a radius of @xmath39 , which corresponds to the spatial extent of the 10 @xmath16 m emission ( molster et al .",
    "1999 ) , to the inner boundary of the h@xmath0 maximum ( fig .  1 ) and the forbidden line maxima ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the optical depth at @xmath40   exceeds unity at a distance of @xmath41 from the star , but is lower closer to the star .",
    "this corresponds to the inner cavity also seen in the 10 @xmath16 m emission .",
    "the red - shifted [ n  ii ] emission becomes stronger than the blue - shifted emission at relative positions @xmath42 .",
    "this can not be explained by optical depth effects and must therefore indicate deviations from spherical symmetry in the density and/or excitation conditions in that part of the nebula .",

    "the dust around afgl 4106 causes extinction of line emission that originates from behind the dusty cse , and emission in the mid- and far - ir .",

    "an extinction map such as h@xmath0/h@xmath153 would be useful to trace the dust , whereas a radio map obtained in the free - free continuum may be used to trace the distribution of ionized matter .",
    "density - bounded ionized nebulae like the one around afgl 4106 are rare and presumably short - lived , but not unique : similar nebulae are observed around luminous blue variables ( e.g  ag car ) and wolf - rayet stars ( voors et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "unless a significant population of very small grains is postulated , dust temperatures in the detached dust shell around afgl 4106 do not reach more than a few @xmath154 k and hence thermal emission from dust grains can not explain the part of the near - ir emission observed by garca - lario et al.(1994 ) that is ( projected ) co - spatial with the dust shell .",
    "thus it seems more likely that the near - ir emission is due to either free - free emission from the ionized component in the dust shell or starlight that is scattered by the large grains ( @xmath155 m ) found by molster et al .",
    ". the line intensity ratios of h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] unambiguously point at excitation conditions similar to those found in planetary nebulae ( see garca - lario et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the bow - shaped region where the line emission reaches its maximum",
    "the excitation mechanism may have a shock component , resulting in enhanced emission by [ n  ii ] over that by h@xmath0 .",
    "the shock may be due to the collision of the cse of afgl 4106 with the interstellar medium if the system is moving with a supersonic velocity with respect to the interstellar medium .",
    "h@xmath0 emission from regions outside of the bow shape ( up to about twice the outer radius of the dust shell ) may be explained by an h  ii region being formed .",
    "afgl 4106 is experiencing on - going mass loss .",
    "evidence for this is seen in enhanced absorption in the short - wavelength wings of si  ii , fe  i , ii and n  i lines .",
    "fluorescence emission of [ ca  ii ] ( see also riera et al .",
    "1995 ) originates from material that has been expelled not more than a few decades ago .",
    "furthermore , the core emission in the 10 @xmath16 m image must be of circumstellar origin ( either dust or ionized gas ) .",
    "if dust is present close to the star then it must be optically thin at visual wavelengths .",
    "the reason for this is that our modelling of the 10 @xmath16 m emission yields a luminosity that is in perfect agreement with the integrated bolometric luminosity and reasonable estimations for interstellar extinction ( garca - lario et al .",
    "1994 ; molster et al .",
    "1999 ) if the dust extinction coefficient index @xmath124 ( as in volk & kwok 1988 ) .",
    "the mass contained in the dust shell is a few @xmath156[kpc]@xmath146 m@xmath2 and @xmath157 times less than the mass as derived by molster et al.(1999 ) .",
    "this is in part due to the choices by molster et al .  for the ( smaller ) inner and ( larger ) outer radii of the dust shell that together yield a duration of the dusty mass loss @xmath158 that is about three times as long as we estimate here .",
    "they assume a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 whereas here we adopt a value of 200 , but the time - averaged dust mass - loss rate that molster et al.derive from their modelling of the spectral energy distribution is an order of a magnitude higher than we estimate here .",
    "this may be the result of differences in the optical constants of the dust species used in their modelling using large grains ( @xmath155 m ) from those of the dust in volk & kwok ( 1988 ) that we use here .",
    "the mass - loss rate estimate from the co emission , however , is in between the mass - loss rates that we estimate for the inner and outer radii of the dusty cse , and thus seems to favour our more moderate mass - loss rates over the extremely high mass - loss rates estimated by molster et al .",
    "the discrepancy might be resolved by storing most of the dust mass into large grains at large distances from the star , outside the cse as traced by the 10 @xmath16 m emission , yielding the observed emission at wavelengths longward of @xmath159 m .",
    "the expansion velocity has increased over time from @xmath36 km s@xmath6 at the time when the material at the outer rim of the dust shell was expelled ( tracer : [ n  ii ] ) through @xmath160 km s@xmath6 ( tracer : co ) up to @xmath31 km s@xmath6 at present ( tracers : si  ii , fe  i , ii and n  i ) . in combination with a steady mass loss this velocity evolution could yield the radial density dependence of @xmath161 as derived by molster et al .",
    "this consideration suggests that of our models , model c is to be favoured : a constant mass - loss rate during the formation of the dust shell .",
