    "rateless codes present a class of codes that can be truncated to a finite number of lengths , each of which has a certain likelihood of being decoded to recover the entire message . compared with conventional coding schemes having a single rate @xmath3",
    ", such codes can achieve multiple rate levels @xmath4 , depending on different channel conditions .",
    "a rateless code is said to be _ perfect _ if each part of its codeword is capacity achieving . compared with conventional codes ,",
    "rateless codes offer a potentially _ higher rate_. several results have been obtained on the design of perfect rateless codes over erasure channels and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    unlike in the fixed channel scenario ,",
    "non - zero error probability always exists in fading channels , when the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) is not available at the transmitter and a codeword spans only one or a small number of fading blocks . in this scenario",
    ", it is well known that there is a fundamental tradeoff between the information rate and error probability over fading channels , which can be characterized as the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) @xcite .",
    "consider a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) system and a family of codes @xmath5 operating at average snr @xmath6 per receive antenna and having rates @xmath3 . the multiplexing gain and diversity order are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average error probability at the transmission rate @xmath3 .",
    "the dmt is an effective performance measure for implementing the rateless coding principles in a fading channel .",
    "two main concerns naturally arise : ( a ) determining the dmt limit for rateless coding with finite numbers of blocks in a fading environment and discovering how it performs with regard to conventional schemes ; and ( b ) determining dmt achieving codes that are simple ( in the sense of encoding and decoding complexity ) .      in this paper",
    ", we analyze the dmt performance of rateless codes .",
    "the results show that , compared with conventional coding schemes having multiplexing gain @xmath9 , rateless codes having multiple rates @xmath10 offer an _ effective _ multiplexing gain @xmath11 of @xmath12 , given the same diversity gain at every rate , when @xmath9 is _ small_. as @xmath9 increases , the performance of rateless codes degrades and ultimately becomes the same as that of conventional schemes .",
    "also while increasing @xmath1 lifts up the overall system dmt curve , it does not necessarily improve the system multiplexing gain for every fixed value of @xmath9 .",
    "it is then revealed that the design of such rateless codes follows the principle of parallel channel codes that are _ approximately universal _",
    "@xcite over fading channels .",
    "more specifically , it is shown that for a single - input single - output ( siso ) channel , the formerly developed _",
    "length permutation codes for parallel channels @xcite having rate @xmath0 can be transformed _ directly _ into rateless codes of @xmath1-length having multiple rate levels @xmath4 , to achieve the dmt performance limit . for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo )",
    "channels , the results in the paper suggest a type of rateless codes that may be viewed as a combination of conventional mimo space - time codes and parallel channel codes , both of which have been designed for fading channels .",
    "the performance of rateless coding over fading channels has also been considered in @xcite , in which the throughput and error probability are discussed .",
    "however , the tradeoff between these two was not analyzed explicitly .",
    "for example , the results in @xcite shows that increasing the value of @xmath1 will decrease the system error probability in certain scenario and is therefore desirable . in this paper",
    "we show that while this discovery is true , the system throughput , i.e. , multiplexing gain might decrease when @xmath1 becomes larger for every fixed value of @xmath9 .",
    "overall , our results reveal that the optimal design of rateless codes requires the consideration of both @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "rateless coding may be considered as a type of hybrid - arq scheme @xcite .",
    "the dmt for arq has been revealed in @xcite .",
    "however , it will be shown in the paper that this dmt curve was incomplete and represents the performance only when @xmath13 in which @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number of transmit and receive antennas .",
    "the _ complete _ dmt curve for rateless coding including those parts for higher @xmath9 has never been revealed before , and will be shown in this paper .",
    "in addition to this , the results in this paper also offer a relationship between the design parameter ( i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath1 ) and the effective multiplexing gain @xmath11 of the system , thus offer further insights into system design and operational meaning compared to conventional coding schemes .",
    "furthermore , we suggest new design solutions for rateless codes . previous work on finite - rate feedback mimo channels relies on either power control or adaptive modulation and coding ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are not necessary for our scheme .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is proposed in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "the dmt performance of rateless codes is studied . in section iv ,",
    "design of specific rateless codes over fading channels is discussed . finally , concluding remarks are made in section v.",
    "we consider a frequency - flat fading channel with @xmath14 transmit antennas and @xmath15 receive antennas .",
    "we assume that the transmitter does not know the instantaneous csi on its corresponding forward channels , while csi is available at the receiver .",
    "each message is encoded into a codeword of @xmath1 blocks .",
    "each block takes @xmath16 channel uses .",
    "we assume that the channel remains static for the entire codeword length ( i.e. , @xmath1 blocks ) .",
    "the system input - output relationship can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the input signal matrix ; @xmath19 is the channel transfer matrix whose elements are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian random variables with zero means and unit variances ; @xmath20 is the awgn matrix with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 is the output signal matrix .",
    "@xmath23 is the total transmit power , which also corresponds to the average snr @xmath6 ( per receive antenna ) at the receiver .",
    "the input signal matrix @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 \\label{code}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the codeword matrix being sent during the @xmath27th block , and its corresponding receiver noise matrix is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "we impose a power constraint on each @xmath29 so that \\leqslant m$ ] , which offers at least the same performance . ]",
    "@xmath30 \\leqslant m,\\ ] ] for @xmath31 .",
    "assume that the transmitter sends the codeword at a rate @xmath3 bits per channel use .",
    "a message of size @xmath32 is encoded into a codeword @xmath29 ( @xmath33 ) and transmitted in @xmath16 channel uses .",
    "an alternative method is to encode a message of size @xmath34 into @xmath24 .",
    "both encoding methods will offer the same performance provided that @xmath16 is sufficiently large .",
    "when rateless coding is applied , we wish to decode a message of size @xmath34 with the codeword structure as shown in ( [ code ] ) . during the transmission ,",
    "the receiver measures the total mutual information @xmath35 between the transmitter and the receiver and compares it with @xmath34 after it receives each codeword block @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath36 after the @xmath27th block , the receiver remains silent and waits for the next block .",
    "if @xmath37 after the @xmath27th block , it decodes the received codeword @xmath38 $ ] and sends one bit of positive feedback to the transmitter . upon receiving the feedback , the transmitter stops transmitting the remaining part of the current codeword and starts transmitting the next message immediately .    unlike conventional schemes",
    ", this process will bring multiple rate levels @xmath4 .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 after the first block is received ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , the receiver will be able to decode the entire message and the rate becomes @xmath0 .",
    "similar observations can be made for @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , compared with conventional schemes , the corresponding transmission rate achieved by using rateless codes is always _ equal or higher_. specifically , we define the multiplexing gain for each rate level as @xmath41 where @xmath42 later we will show through the dmt analysis that rateless coding can retain the same diversity gain as conventional schemes , but with a much higher multiplexing gain especially when the corresponding @xmath9 is low .",
    "denote by @xmath43 the decoding error when decoding is performed after the @xmath27th block ( @xmath44 ) and by @xmath45 the joint probability that a decoding error occurs and decoding is achieved after @xmath27th block .",
    "the system overall error probability can be expressed as @xmath46    define @xmath47 ( @xmath44 ) to be the probability with which @xmath48 after the @xmath27th block , and note that @xmath49 . following the steps in section ii.b in @xcite , the average transmission rate for _ each message _ in bits per channel use",
    "is given by @xmath50 note that this @xmath51 describes the average rate with which the message is removed from the _ transmitter _ ; i.e. , it quantifies how quickly the message is decoded at the receiver .",
    "we define the effective multiplexing gain of the system as @xmath52 define @xmath53 to be the piecewise linear function connecting the points @xmath54 for integral @xmath55 .",
    "recall that a conventional scheme operating at multiplexing gain @xmath9 ( @xmath56 ) would have the diversity gain @xmath57 .",
    "the following theorem shows the performance of rateless coding for @xmath58 .",
    "assume a sufficiently large @xmath16 .",
    "for rateless codes having multiple multiplexing gain levels @xmath41 , the corresponding dmt can be expressed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "finally , @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "see appendix a.    note that for rateless coding to achieve the performance in _ theorem 1 _ , we do not necessarily require @xmath65 . as long as @xmath16 is large enough such that the error probability @xmath66 for each @xmath27 , the dmt in _ theorem 1 _ can be achieved .",
    "while the minimal @xmath16 for a general mimo channel when applying rateless coding is unknown to the authors , it will be shown later that for siso channels , @xmath67 is sufficient to achieve the optimal dmt in _",
    "theorem 1_.    comparing rateless coding with conventional schemes , it can be shown that for @xmath68 , @xmath69 for @xmath70 . in this scenario rateless coding",
    "can improve the multiplexing gain up to @xmath1 times that of conventional schemes , given the same diversity gain .",
    "1 gives an example when @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the operating point a in the curve for a conventional scheme for @xmath73 corresponds to point b in the curve for rateless coding .    .",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72.,width=355 ]    an important observation from _ theorem 1 _ is that the system performance will not be improved after @xmath9 ( _ almost _ ) reaches @xmath74 , as the optimal dmt is already achieved by using rateless coding .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the first block can no longer support the message size when the message rate reaches @xmath74 .",
    "thus the system multiplexing gain _ decreases _ for the same diversity gain , and finally offers the same dmt as conventional schemes when the first @xmath75 blocks all fail to decode the message .",
    "2 shows an example when @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this observation also implies that for any fixed value of @xmath9 , simply increasing the value of @xmath1 does _ not _ _ necessarily _ improve the system dmt performance .",
    "although the overall system dmt will increase when @xmath1 is larger , the multiplexing gain might decrease for certain fixed values of @xmath9 . a convenient choice for @xmath1 would be in the region of @xmath78 .",
    "however , note that the maximal multiplexing gain @xmath79 can be achieved only with zero diversity gain , and this happens when @xmath80 _ regardless of _ the value of @xmath1 .    .",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77.,width=355 ]",
    "note that codewords @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) in ( [ code ] ) are transmitted through different channels that are _ orthogonal _ in time .",
    "this is analogous to transmitting @xmath81 through different channels that are parallel in _ space_. in the ( space ) parallel channel model , elements in @xmath83 can be jointly ( simultaneously ) decoded .",
    "however , for the channel model considered in this paper , which we now call the _ rateless channel _ , the decoding process needs to follow certain direction in time , i.e. , we start decoding from @xmath84 , then @xmath85 $ ] if @xmath84 is not decoded , etc .",
    "this comparison implies that while good parallel channel codes can be used as the basis for rateless coding , they might need modifications in order to offer good performance over the rateless channel .",
    "specifically , for the rateless channel expressed in the form of ( [ ior ] ) , we consider the corresponding parallel mimo channel , in which each sub - channel is a mimo channel , having the following input - output relationship : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath81 and @xmath88 are the same as those in ( [ ior ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the dmt for this system is @xmath89 for @xmath90 . assuming a code that achieves this dmt , when we implement its transformation @xmath91 $ ] into the rateless channel having multiple rates @xmath41",
    ", it is not difficult to show that @xmath92 in order to make the overall @xmath93 , we need to ensure that @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "however , those conditions are not _ essential _ in order to achieve the optimal dmt for the parallel channel shown in ( [ iop ] ) , which only requires the condition ( [ parlc ] ) .",
    "thus stricter code design criteria are required for the rateless channel .",
    "one example of such a criterion is the _ approximately universal _",
    "criterion @xcite .",
    "codes being _ approximately universal _ for parallel channels ensure that the highest error probability when decoding _ any _ subset of @xmath96 in the set of all non - outage events decays _ exponentially _ in snr ( i.e. , in the form of @xmath97 for some @xmath98 ) under _ any _ fading distribution , and thus can be ignored compared with the outage probability under the same fading distribution , when the snr goes to infinity . specifically , we consider the following parallel mimo channel which is more general than the one in ( [ iop ] ) : @xmath99 where each channel matrix in @xmath100 ( @xmath82 ) follows an _ arbitrary _ distribution . in particular , when the matrices in @xmath100 are i.i.d .",
    "and of the same distributions as the @xmath87 in ( [ ior ] ) , following the same steps as those in @xcite , it is not difficult to show that the optimal dmt for this system is @xmath101 for @xmath90 .",
    "now , we are ready to state the following theorem considering the performance of rateless codes that are transformed from the approximately universal codes for the parallel channel in ( [ iop2 ] ) .",
    "suppose a code @xmath102^t$ ] is _ approximately universal _ for the parallel channel shown in ( [ iop2 ] ) and can achieve the dmt points @xmath103 for @xmath104 when the channel matrices have i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading .",
    "then , its transformation @xmath91 $ ] , when applied to the rateless channel shown in ( [ ior ] ) aiming at multiple multiplexing gains @xmath41 , can achieve the dmt shown in _ theorem 1_.    see appendix b.    while approximately universal codes for the general parallel mimo channel is unknown to the authors , approximately universal codes for parallel siso channels do exist , and can be transformed directly into good rateless codes for siso channels . in the following ,",
    "we apply permutation codes for parallel channels @xcite to the rateless channel .",
    "permutation codes are a class of codes generated from qam constellations . in the encoding process , a message is mapped into different qam constellation points across all subchannels .",
    "the constellation over one subchannel is a permutation of the points in the constellation over any other subchannel .",
    "the permutation is optimized such that the minimal codeword difference is large enough to satisfy the approximate universality criterion .",
    "explicit permutation codes can be constructed using _ universally decodable matrices_. we refer the readers to @xcite and the references therein for details .",
    "it has been shown that permutation codes achieve the optimal dmt for parallel channels and have a particularly simple structure .",
    "for example , the codewords are of _ unit _ length .",
    "assume the transmission rates over rateless channel are @xmath2 bits per channel use .",
    "to implement permutation codes , we choose a codebook of size @xmath105 ( messages ) for the parallel channel in ( [ iop2 ] ) .",
    "each message is mapped into a code @xmath106^t$ ] , in which each @xmath107 is an @xmath105-point qam constellation .",
    "the message can be fully recovered as long as any subset of @xmath108 can be correctly decoded . now",
    ", we transform this code into the form @xmath91 $ ] for the rateless channel .",
    "since @xmath109 decays exponentially in snr due to the approximate universality of such codes , the overall error probability is always dominated by that upon receiving all @xmath29 for _ infinitely _ high snr .",
    "more precisely , we summarize the above observations as the following corollary .",
    "rateless codes that are transformed from permutation codes for parallel channels can offer exactly the same performance as shown in _",
    "theorem 1 _ over the siso rateless channel .",
    "the proof is a direct extension of the proof of _ theorem 2 _ and is omitted .",
    "the performance of rateless codes has been studied for mimo fading channels in terms of the dmt .",
    "the analysis shows that design principles for rateless codes can follow these of the approximately universal codes for parallel mimo channels .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that for a siso channel , the formerly developed permutation codes of _ unit _ length for parallel channels having rate @xmath0 can be transformed _ directly _ into rateless codes of length @xmath1 having multiple rate levels @xmath4 , to achieve the desired optimal dmt performance .",
    "define @xmath110 . following the steps in @xcite , it is easy to show that @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "we write the error probability as @xmath113 in ( [ ub ] ) , @xmath114 is error probability when @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the mutual information of the channel in each block . using fano s inequality we can obtain the error probability lower bound @xcite : @xmath117 since @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 , and thus the desired performance upper bound is obtained .",
    "now we prove the achievability part .",
    "consider @xmath120 .",
    "following the same argument as in the proof of theorem 10.1.1 in @xcite , we get @xmath121 for sufficiently large @xmath16 .",
    "note that a very similar argument has been made in _ lemma 1 _ in @xcite , although it is claimed there that both @xmath16 and @xmath1 are required to be sufficiently large in order to satisfy ( [ gau ] ) .",
    "now @xmath122 can be further rewritten as @xmath123 note that @xmath124 for @xmath125 . thus @xmath126 and diversity gain @xmath127 is achievable in the range @xmath128 .",
    "note that @xmath110 , and thus we have @xmath129 for @xmath130    so far we have only considered the scenario in which @xmath131 .",
    "now the question to ask is what happens if we increase the value of @xmath9 to @xmath132 and beyond . in this scenario , @xmath133 , and",
    "thus @xmath134 the message rate @xmath11 is decreased to @xmath135 due to the fact that after the first block the receiver has no chance of decoding the message correctly and it always needs the second block .",
    "however , the system error probability @xmath136 is not changed .",
    "therefore the message rate becomes @xmath137 and the system dmt becomes @xmath138 similarly , when @xmath11 reaches @xmath139 again , i.e. , @xmath9 reaches @xmath140 , @xmath141 thus @xmath142 and @xmath143 the system dmt becomes @xmath144 continuing following the above until @xmath145 , we obtain the desired result and the proof is completed .",
    "assume that the system in ( [ iop ] ) transmits at a rate @xmath146 .",
    "the probability of any decoding error can be upper bounded by @xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the outage probability and @xmath149 is the average error probability given that the channel is not in outage .",
    "approximately universality means that for such codes @xmath150 under _ any _ fading distribution . for the system in ( [ iop2 ] ) , these include the fading distributions in which @xmath151 follow the same distribution as the @xmath87 in ( [ ior ] ) and @xmath152 for all @xmath95 .",
    "when such codes are transformed into the rateless channels shown in ( [ ior ] ) , it is a simple matter to show that @xmath153 for any @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is given in ( [ ub ] ) .",
    "thus the system error probability for the rateless channel in ( [ ior ] ) is always upper bounded by @xmath156 the rest of the proof follows that of _ theorem 1 _ and is omitted .",
