    "the response function is site dependent , so , similarly to what done for the autocorrelation function , we will consider the spatially averaged quantity @xmath98 which will be denoted as @xmath99 .",

    "notice that in one - dimensional @xmath103 model scaling is violated , and our hypothesis on dynamical exponents does not hold .",
    "the scope of this study being the analysis of the behaviour of finite @xmath21 models , the less numerically demanding case to start with would naturally be the @xmath103 model .",
