    "<S> we call  gzk photons \" those photons produced by extragalactic nucleons through the resonant photoproduction of pions , the so called gzk effect . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we fitted the assumed uhecr spectrum above @xmath1  ev solely with primary nucleons and the gzk photons they produce . </S>",
    "<S> the gzk photon flux depends on the uhecr spectrum assumed , the slope and maximum energy of the primary nucleon spectrum , the minimum distance to the sources and the intervening radio background and average extragalactic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we took a phenomenological approach in choosing the range of the several relevant parameters , namely we took for each of them a range of values mentioned in the literature , without attempting to assign them to particular sources or acceleration mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we also assumed the existence of a galactic or extragalactic low energy component ( lec ) when necessary to fit the assumed uhecr at energies below @xmath0  ev , taking care that it is negligible at energies 3@xmath2  ev and above .    </S>",
    "<S> we used a numerical code developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to compute the flux of gzk photons produced by an homogeneous distribution of sources emitting originally only protons ( however the results at the high energies considered is the same for primary neutrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> it uses the kinematic equation approach and calculates the propagation of nucleons , stable leptons and photons using the standard dominant processes .    </S>",
    "<S> we parametrized the initial proton flux for any source with a power law function , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the power law index @xmath4 and maximum energy @xmath5 were considered free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath6 was fixed by normalizing the final proton flux from all sources to the observed flux of uhecr , which we took to be either the agasa spectrum or the hires spectrum ( given that a reliable auger spectrum in not yet available ) . </S>",
    "<S> we considered the power law index to be in the range @xmath7 and @xmath5 between @xmath8  ev and @xmath9  ev . for the average extragalactic magnetic field we took the range @xmath10 g to @xmath11 g ,  @xcite and for the radio background we considered three estimates : one from clark et al . and two higher ones from protheroe and biermann  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the largest gzk photon fractions in uhecr happen for small values of @xmath4 , large values of @xmath5 , small minimal distance to the sources ( which is compatible with a small frequency of clustering of the events ) and small intervening backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> the smallest gzk photon fluxes are obtained with the opposite choices . in the most favorable cases for a large photon flux </S>",
    "<S> , gzk photons could dominate the uhecr flux in an energy range above 10@xmath12  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us  @xcite to fit the agasa data , at the expense of assuming that the initial protons could have a hard spectrum @xmath13 and be accelerated to energies as high as @xmath9  ev . in this extreme case , </S>",
    "<S> the agasa data can be explained without any new physics , except in what the mechanism of acceleration of the initial protons is concerned . with the hires </S>",
    "<S> spectrum the gzk photons are always subdominant and can be neglected for the fit .    </S>",
    "<S> proceeding in this manner , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we fitted the agasa  @xcite and the hires monocular  @xcite data trying to minimize and to maximize the number of gzk protons produced , to obtain the expected range of the gzk - photon fraction in uhecr . </S>",
    "<S> we found ( see the pink bands in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] ) that the gzk photon fraction of the total integrated uhecr flux , for the agasa spectrum is between 5% and 7% above @xmath0 ev and between 30% and 60% above @xmath8 ev , thus auger should be able to see these photons or place interesting bounds on the flux parameters . </S>",
    "<S> recall that fitting the agasa data with astrophysical sources requires the extreme choices for the initial spectrum mentioned above . with the hires spectrum , instead </S>",
    "<S> the predicted gzk photon fraction is between 0.01% and 1% of the uhecr above @xmath0 ev and between 0.001% and 4% above @xmath8 ev , thus these photons may or may not be within the reach of auger .     for ( a ) the agasa spectrum ( left panel ) and ( b ) the hires spectrum ( right panel ) . </S>",

    "<S> detection of a larger photon flux than expected for gzk photons given the particular uhecr spectrum assumed , would imply the emission of photons at the source or new physics . </S>",
    "<S> new physics is involved in top - down models , proposed as an alternative to acceleration models to explain the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> all top - down models predict photon dominance at the highest energies ( and no heavy nuclei ) . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we estimated the minimum photon fraction top - down models predict , not only assuming the agasa spectrum , which these models were originally proposed to explain , but also assuming the hires spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that at high energy , close to 10@xmath12  ev , the maximum expected flux of gzk photons is comparable to ( for the agasa spectrum ) or much smaller than ( for the hires spectrum ) the minimum flux of photons predicted by top - down models which fit the agasa or the hires data ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> three top - down models were considered : z - bursts  @xcite , topological defects ( necklaces ) ( for a review see for example ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and super heavy dark matter particles  @xcite ( in particular , predictions of ref .  @xcite were used ) .    in order to estimate the minimum photon ratio predicted by top - down models we assumed that these models explain only the highest energy uhecr ( if they do not explain even those events , the models are irrelevant for uhecr ) . for this purpose we made liberal use of a component of extragalactic nucleons which would explain all but the highest energy uhecr . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of two components , one of accelerated nucleons and another of top - down generated particles , which would conspire to produce a continuous spectrum , is contrived , and was used only as a means to minimize the number of top - down photons . fitting the agasa and hires uhecr spectra in this manner we showed that the photon ratio at energies close to @xmath8 ev is always larger than 10% , in most cases </S>",
    "<S> is larger than 50% , independently of the uhecr spectrum assumed , making this is a crucial test for top - down models . reaching the level of @xmath1530% ( 10% ) on the photon ratio at energies close to @xmath8 ev </S>",
    "<S> , auger will find uhecr photons or reject most ( all ) top - down models , independently of the uhecr spectrum . </S>"
