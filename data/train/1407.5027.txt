    "it is well - known that there are many different methods of computing the linking number of an oriented 2-component link in @xmath0 ( see for example @xcite ) , and perhaps the simplest is the combinatorial formula which counts the number of signed crossings of one component going under another component in a diagram of the link .",
    "it is much more subtle to compute higher - order linking numbers , and it has been a folklore to use the intersection theory in the process , which was first suggested by w. massey . in @xcite massey introduced the higher - order linking as an application of his higher - order cohomology operations defined in terms of suitable cochains @xcite , and he calculated the third - order linking numbers for some 3-component links by shifting from cohomology and cup product to homology and intersection theory via duality theorems for manifolds . later several works along this direction ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) gave methods in various forms for computing the higher - order linking numbers , and others computed milnor s",
    "@xmath1 -invariants ( e.g. @xcite ) by using their well - known connection to massey invariants ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) ; but a formal derivation of the general formulae in intersection theory which are used for the computation has not yet been given , and a concrete algorithm for the computation is hence lacking . in this paper we will complete massey s original approach by developing systematically the intersection theory at the relative chain - cochain level in the simplicial category , and use it to derive recursive combinatorial formulae for computing all higher - order linking numbers . the formulae are algorithmic in the sense that the computation of an @xmath2-th order linking requires the construction of certain surfaces from the assumption that the @xmath3-st order linking being 0 . from a diagram of a link , these formulae give rise to a combinatorial algorithm for computing higher - order linkings by using seifert disks of the link to facilitate the construction of the intersection of seifert surfaces of the link , which is necessary for the inductive step .",
