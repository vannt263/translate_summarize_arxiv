    "polymer solutions show a wide variety of behaviors , depending on chain length , density , and temperature.@xcite in the dilute regime the isolated chain radius of gyration @xmath2 is the relevant length scale and the properties of the solution can be described in terms of single - chain properties and of the solvent - quality parameter .",
    "the radius of gyration scales as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the monomer characteristic length ( kuhn segment ) , which depends on chemical details and temperature , @xmath5 is the number of monomers per chain , and @xmath6 is a universal exponent . in the good - solvent regime@xcite @xmath7 , while @xmath8 ( with logarithmic corrections @xcite ) for @xmath9-solvents .",
    "the semidilute regime is entered when chains start to overlap , but still the monomer density is small . if @xmath10 is the polymer concentration",
    " @xmath11 is the number of chains and @xmath12 the volume of the system under consideration  and @xmath13 is the monomer concentration , the semidilute regime is characterized by @xmath14 ( or equivalently by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polymer volume fraction ) and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the overlap concentration .",
    "note that @xmath19 .",
    "hence , when increasing @xmath0 , increasingly longer polymer chains are needed to ensure the semidilute condition @xmath17 . if @xmath20 is not small , one enters the concentrated or melt regime . from this discussion",
    "it appears that very long polymers are necessary to obtain a genuine semidilute regime over several orders of magnitude in chain density . for this reason , simulations of semidilute solutions of linear chains , even at the level of generic lattice or bead - spring models with implicit solvent ,",
    "are quite expensive and have been limited to not too long chains and not too high densities .",
    "@xcite moreover , in many complex situations , polymers only constitute one species in the solution , making full - monomer simulations even more difficult . in these cases a modelling at length scales of the order of the polymer size is often sufficient to provide the relevant thermodynamic and structural informations on the solution .",
    "for instance , to determine the phase behavior of polymer - colloid mixtures in the colloid regime , @xcite a detailed microscopic model of the polymers is not necessary .",
    "it is enough to use coarse - grained models which retain the essential thermodynamic ( long - wavelength ) behavior of the polymer solution.@xcite other examples are block copolymers for which the self - assembling of the chains in supramolecular aggregates of various shapes and sizes is ubiquitous .",
    "the description of the physical behavior of the self - assembled phases only requires a modelling at the mesoscopic level rather than at the microscopic ( monomer ) level .",
    "@xcite this is the realm of self - consistent field - theoretical methods which have proved to be very effective to describe the physics of concentrated solutions and melts of homopolymers and block - copolymer blends .",
    "@xcite    coarse - grained models for soft condensed matter systems have received much attention in the last two decades.@xcite in the simplest approach one maps polymer chains onto point particles interacting by means of the pairwise potential of mean force between the centers of mass of two isolated polymers .",
    "@xcite this potential is of the order of @xmath21 at full overlap,@xcite has a limited range of the order of @xmath22 and is very well represented by a linear combination of few gaussian functions .",
    "@xcite such a model is however limited to the dilute regime @xmath23 , in which many - body interactions@xcite can be neglected .",
    "this limitation was overcome ten years ago in a seminal work,@xcite which eliminated the complexity of the many - body interactions by introducing a density - dependent pair potential , which is unique according to henderson theorem @xcite and reduces to the potential of mean force in the limit of zero density .",
    "this work has paved the way to the use of soft effective particles to represent polymer coils in complex situations such as in modelling colloid - polymer mixtures.@xcite however , density - dependent potentials are difficult to handle .",
    "care is needed to derive the correct thermodynamics @xcite and to compute free energies and phase diagrams.@xcite also their use in non - homogeneous situations is cumbersome since the interaction should depend on the local density which is not known beforehands and some kind of self - consistent procedure should be developed .",
    "furthermore , representing polymers as soft spherically symmetric particles is not always appropriate .",
    "for instance , in studying polymers adsorbed on surfaces , like polymer brushes or polymer - coated colloids , it is clear that the anchorage to the surface breaks the rotational symmetry of the chains , an effect that must be taken into account in any accurate coarse - grained model .",
    "a further example is in modelling solutions of a - b block copolymers which can not be represented as soft particles interacting by a spherically symmetric pair potential .",
    "@xcite    in principle those limitations can be overcome by switching to a model at a lower level of coarse graining , i.e. by mapping a long linear polymer to a short linear chain of soft effective monomers ( called `` blobs '' in the following ) . such model retains some internal degrees of freedom , which allow more flexibility in chain geometry as necessary , for instance , in anisotropic systems .",
    "moreover , in the semidilute regime , this model is expected to allow the use of density - independent blob - blob interactions , since the local density of the blobs can always be kept small by increasing the number of blobs per chain . indeed , if chains of @xmath5 monomers are partitioned in @xmath24 effective blobs of @xmath25 monomers each , the local concentration of the blobs is @xmath26 .",
    "the blob overlap concentration is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius of gyration of the blob .",
    "if we assume that @xmath29 , where @xmath4 is the kuhn length that appears in the scaling of the radius of gyration ( this relation , though not exact , is a very good approximation ) , we obtain @xmath30 hence , for any polymer volume fraction @xmath0 , since @xmath31 above the collapsed phase , one can choose @xmath24 so that @xmath32 , i.e. , so that blobs do not overlap . in this regime ,",
    "the size of each blob is approximately density independent , hence each blob can be replaced by an effective single atom of fixed size in a coarse - grained representation . moreover",
    ", one expects the many - body interactions among blobs of different chains to be negligible .",
    "hence , the parametrization of the intermolecular interactions among the chains in terms of zero - density pair potentials should be reasonably accurate .",
    "conversely , one can use the @xmath24 blob model with zero - density intermolecular pair potentials up to @xmath33 . for larger concentrations",
    "many - chain intermolecular interactions come into play .",
    "the main problem in this approach is how to obtain the intramolecular interactions , i.e. , the potentials among the blobs of the same chain .",
    "the problem is trivial for a dumbbell model ( @xmath34 ) , where the blob - blob interaction is just the potential of mean force , but becomes increasingly difficult when increasing the number @xmath24 of blobs per chain .",
    "indeed , the intramolecular effective interaction , which is simply minus the logarithm of the joint distribution of the blob positions , is inherently a many - body interaction , which can not be represented as a hierarchy of two - body , three - body , etc .",
    "terms , at variance with what happens for the intermolecular potentials . in that case",
    "the small - density expansion gives the pair potential at lowest order , the three - body potential at next - to - leading order , and so on .",
    "therefore , approximations must be introduced in trying to reproduce some features of the underlying full - monomer system .    as a first attempt in this direction , pierleoni _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a multiblob model , referred to as model m1 in the following , for homopolymers in good - solvent conditions .",
    "they started from the intramolecular and intermolecular potentials appropriate for dumbbells ( a two - blob molecule ) , a problem that can be solved as explained in addison _",
    "et al._@xcite the potentials for chains with more blobs were then obtained from the dumbbell potentials using a transferability hypothesis .",
    "this model has the correct scaling behavior for good - solvent polymers in dilute and semidilute solutions , @xcite including the excluded - volume screening at large length scales with density .",
    "however , its prediction for the eos of the solution is incorrect,@xcite shading serious doubts on the correctness of the transferability assumption for the potentials . a modified model , referred to as model m2 in the following , was also introduced.@xcite in this model , for each number of blobs , the parameters of the potential are tuned to match full - monomer results for the eos .",
    "although successful in reproducing the thermodynamics , model m2 is inherently different from m1 in that full - monomer results at finite density are needed to tune the model parameters , which is an evident limitation of this approach in more complex situations .    in this paper , beside comparing in detail results for models m1 and m2 to full - monomer predictions in a wide range of polymer concentrations in the semidilute regime , we introduce a new coarse - grained model for semidilute solutions . in this model",
    "we map a single chain on a tetramer , i.e. , a chain of four blobs , in such a way to reproduce all two - body , and some three - body and four - body distributions of an isolated good - solvent polymer at the full monomer level . in order to accomplish this program",
    "we use bonding , bending and torsional angle potentials , plus additional 1 - 3 and 1 - 4 central potentials which we obtain with the iterative boltzmann inversion ( ibi ) procedure .",
    "@xcite furthermore , a single intermolecular pair potential between blobs of different tetramers is obtained in such a way to reproduce the center - of - mass radial distribution function between two isolated chains at the full - monomer level .",
    "this model provides correct results for the eos up to reduced densities @xmath35 , a considerably larger range of densities with respect to simpler models .",
    "the tetramer model presented here is a first successful attempt to realize the multiblob program : building a multiblob coarse - grained model based on zero - density potentials which is able to provide the correct single - chain structure and eos at finite density .",
    "our approach is very close to the coarse - graining procedure applied by fritz _",
    "et al._@xcite to polystyrene .",
    "similar methods were also used for coarse - grained simulations of typical benchmark chains like polycarbonates and polystyrene in a melt , @xcite although in these works the potentials were fixed by requiring the coarse - grained model to reproduce structural properties at fixed pressure and temperature  hence potentials also depend on thermodynamic variables , as is the case for the density - dependent potentials.@xcite in some coarse - graining procedures also thermodynamic information was taken into account to fix the potentials , see , e.g. , rossi _",
    "et al._@xcite and references therein .",
    "we should also mention the approach of vettorel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which extends previous work on a single - blob model.@xcite in this multiblob model each blob carries internal degrees of freedom , to account for the density profile of the underlying full - monomer subchains .",
    "however , the interactions are not derived _",
    "ab initio _ in the coarse - graining procedure , but are obtained by using phenomenological arguments .",
    "finally , we mention the work of clark _",
    "@xcite which applies integral - equation methods to a coarse - grained model appropriate for polymer melts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.2 ]",
    "we present the general formalism behind any coarse - graining procedure and we report our specific methodology to derive the tetramer model . in section [ sec.3 ]",
    "we compare the structure and the thermodynamic behavior predicted by the tetramer model with those ( referred to as full - monomer results in the following ) obtained by using lattice polymer models with a large number of monomers ( @xmath36 )  hence appropriate to obtain the universal , scaling behavior  both at zero and at finite density in the semidilute regime . in section [ sec.4 ]",
    "we report results for the coarse - grained models m1 and m2 and compare them with the tetramer and the full - monomer data .",
    "finally , we collect our conclusions and perspectives in the last section . in the appendix",
    "we give universal predictions for the blob radius of gyration , an important quantity to obtain a meaningful comparison between any coarse - grained model and the underlying full - monomer model .",
    "in order to obtain the coarse - grained blob model ( cgbm ) , one works in the zero - density limit and determines in successive steps the intramolecular potentials , the two - body intermolecular potentials , then , at least in principle , the three - body , four - body , etc .",
    "intermolecular potentials . in an exact mapping",
    "all @xmath37-body intermolecular interactions should be considered . however , as discussed in the introduction , higher - order intermolecular interactions can be neglected if one only considers small densities @xmath38 , where @xmath39 increases ( for a given level of approximation ) with the number @xmath24 of blobs .      in the multiblob approach ,",
    "the basic object is the  blob \" , which is a subchain of the polymer .",
    "suppose we wish to partition a polymeric chain of @xmath5 monomers into @xmath24 blobs of @xmath40 monomers each .",
    "if the monomer positions are given by @xmath41 , one first defines the blob positions @xmath42 as the centers of mass of the subchains of @xmath43 monomers , i.e. @xmath44 for the new coarse - grained chain @xmath45 one defines several standard quantities .",
    "first , one defines its radius of gyration @xmath46 such a quantity is always smaller than @xmath47 , since @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the radius of gyration of @xmath50-th blob : @xmath51 the ratios @xmath52 and @xmath53 of their averages . ] over the polymer configurations are universal , hence independent of the nature of the underlying polymer model as long as @xmath5 is large enough .",
    "the average of the blob squared radius of gyration @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 scales quite simply with @xmath24 in the zero - density limit .",
    "as discussed in [ app - rgblob ] , for all @xmath56 we have quite precisely @xmath57 an expression we will use extensively in the present work ( here and in the following we will use a hat to indicate zero - density quantities ) .    beside the radius of gyration",
    ", we can consider the bond - length distributions ( all blob distributions depend on the number @xmath24 of blobs , which is implicit in the notation ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the statistical average over all chain conformations , which satisfy the normalization conditions @xmath60 they depend on the chosen length scale . as it is standard in renormalization - group analyses of polymer behavior ,",
    "the relevant quantities are the adimensional combinations @xmath61 . for @xmath62",
    "they converge to universal , hence model - independent , functions @xmath63 with @xmath64 , which are normalized as @xmath65 note that , as usual , scaling functions depend only on the adimensional combination @xmath64 .    in this paper",
    "we will also consider the adimensional intramolecular distribution function @xmath66 for large @xmath5 , @xmath67 converges to a universal function @xmath68 , @xmath69 , which is related to the bond - distribution functions defined above by @xmath70 note that the the ratio @xmath71 is simply related to the second moment of @xmath72 [ in the scaling limit to that of @xmath68 ] . for @xmath62 we have @xmath74 beside two - site distributions , one can define three - site correlation functions @xmath75  the corresponding adimensional combinations @xmath76 converge to universal functions of @xmath77 and @xmath78  and , analogously , four - site , five - site , etc . correlations .    as a check of the quality of our results we shall often consider the distribution of @xmath79 .",
    "more precisely , for each polymer configuration we consider the corresponding radius @xmath79 and the adimensional ratio @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the average of the squared radius of gyration over the polymer configurations . the corresponding distribution @xmath82 is universal in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "note that this distribution function can not be written in terms of the bond - length distributions , but is instead a particular @xmath24-blob correlation since @xmath79 depends on the positions of all blobs .      in the cgbm",
    "the basic object is a polyatomic molecule with @xmath24 atoms located in @xmath83 .",
    "all length scales are expressed in terms of @xmath84 , hence potentials and distribution functions depend on the adimensional combination @xmath85 .",
    "the intramolecular potentials are determined by requiring all _ adimensional _ distributions to be identical in the polymer model and in the cgbm at zero density .",
    "for instance , we require @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the average over all single - chain cgbm configurations and @xmath63 are the universal functions defined above , which are computed in the polymer model .    in principle , the determination of the intramolecular potential is straightforward .",
    "first , one determines the @xmath24-body blob distribution in the polymer model at zero density : @xmath88 where the average is over all single - polymer conformations .",
    "the adimensional combination @xmath89 converges for @xmath62 to a universal distribution : @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the cgbm intermolecular potential is then @xmath92 where @xmath93 . by definition",
    ", this choice ensures that the distribution of the @xmath24 atoms in the cgbm is identical to the distribution of the @xmath24 blobs in the polymer model .",
    "hence the intramolecular structure is exactly reproduced .",
    "note that potential ( [ pot - nbody ] ) is an intrinsically @xmath24-body interaction and thus there is no natural method to represent it as a sum of two - body , three - body , etc . , terms . because of the universality of the function @xmath94 , the potential is independent of the polymer model and is valid for any polymeric system under good - solvent conditions .",
    "the radius of gyration @xmath95 of the cgbm molecule differs from the polymer radius of gyration @xmath47 but agrees instead with @xmath96 .",
    "it is important to take this difference into account when comparing finite - density results . for polymers ,",
    "the behavior is universal once densities are expressed in terms of the polymer volume fraction @xmath97 where @xmath11 is the number of polymers contained in the volume @xmath12 .",
    "full - monomer results should be compared with results obtained in the cgbm at volume fractions @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of cgbm molecules .",
    "note that @xmath84 and not @xmath100 appears in the definition of @xmath101 . since @xmath102 converges to 1 as @xmath24 increases , for @xmath24 large ,",
    "say @xmath103 , this conceptual difference is not relevant in practice . in our case , instead , since we consider @xmath104 , it is crucial to use the correct definition , that is the quantity @xmath105",
    ".    once the intramolecular potentials are determined , one must determine the intermolecular potentials , which must be such to reproduce the potentials of mean force in the polymer model .",
    "note that , in order to have an exact mapping of the polymer model onto the cgbm , not only should pair potentials be considered , but also three - body , four - body , etc .",
    "interactions should be included.@xcite however , as we already discussed in the introduction , as @xmath24 increases , these many - body interaction potentials are expected to become smaller , so that the cgbm with only pair potentials should be accurate in a density interval which widens with increasing @xmath24 .      in order to have an exact mapping of the polymeric system onto the @xmath24-blob cgbm",
    ", one should consider an @xmath24-body intramolecular potential , which , for @xmath106 , can be expressed in terms of @xmath107 scalar combinations of the positions of the blobs because of rotational and translational invariance .",
    "the complexity increases rapidly with @xmath24 and for this reason we decided to consider the case @xmath104 , which allows us to limit the number of approximations needed and , at the same time , allows us to go beyond the dilute regime up to @xmath108 - 3 .",
    "however , even for @xmath24 as small as 4 , an exact determination of the intramolecular potential requires considering a function of 6 independent variables , which is far too complex in practice .",
    "thus we have used a limited set of interactions .",
    "the intramolecular interactions have been modelled by introducing six different potentials , each of them depending on a single scalar variable .",
    "this choice is arbitrary , but , as we will show in the following , it is particularly convenient and works quite well .",
    "first , we consider a set of bonding pair potentials : atoms @xmath50 and @xmath109 of the tetramer interact with a pair potential @xmath110 with @xmath111 . because of symmetry we have @xmath112 and @xmath113 , so that there are only four independent potentials to be determined .",
    "then , we consider a bending - angle potential @xmath114 and a torsion - angle potential @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath9 are defined as @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "note that in the tetramer there are two bending angles , which are equivalent by symmetry , and a single torsion angle .",
    "this particular form of the potential set is inspired by the usual modelling of bonded interactions in macromolecules .",
    "however , in that context one only considers a bonding potential between atoms which are first neighbors along the chain , a bending and a torsional term .",
    "instead , our parametrization includes interactions between atoms that are not neighbors along the chain , thereby taking into account to some extent cross - correlations among different degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that the bending potential and the torsion potential involve three and four atoms , respectively , and thus allow us to introduce some of the three - body and four - body interactions present in the exact parametrization .",
    "since we are using a limited set of interactions , not all distributions of the internal degrees of freedom can be exactly reproduced by the cgbm .",
    "we must therefore choose the distributions which we wish to be identical in the polymer and in the cgbm case .",
    "given our choice of interaction potentials , it is natural to use the adimensional bond - length distributions @xmath61 and the distributions of the bending and torsion angle [ in the blob representation of the polymer model , these angles are defined by replacing @xmath119 with @xmath120 in eqs .",
    "( [ bending ] ) and ( [ torsion ] ) ] , which are particular three - body and four - body correlation functions .",
    "if we indicate collectively the six potentials to be determined with @xmath121 , the ( adimensional ) distributions of the @xmath122 variables with @xmath123 in the cgbm and with @xmath124 in the full - monomer case , the potentials should be such that @xmath125 .",
    "the universal ( i.e. , model - independent ) distributions @xmath124 in the polymer case have been determined by performing simulations of self - avoiding walks on a cubic lattice .",
    "to detect scaling corrections , we consider chains of length @xmath126 , 4100 ( the corresponding blobs have @xmath127 monomers , respectively ) .",
    "the ( adimensional ) distributions obtained in the two cases agree within errors , indicating the absence of finite - length effects .",
    "we determine the potentials of the cgbm by using the iterative boltzmann inversion ( ibi ) scheme .",
    "@xcite in this approach the effective interactions which reproduce the target structural quantities are determined iteratively .",
    "the potentials of mean force of the corresponding full - monomer distribution , @xmath128 , have been chosen as initial guesses for all interactions except for @xmath129 .",
    "for @xmath129 we have assumed a simple gaussian potential : we use a gaussian approximation of the potential of mean force between two polymer centers of mass , rescaling the width of the gaussian with the ratio of the radii of gyration of the blob and of the entire chain .",
    "c +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c +    it is also interesting to consider the ratio @xmath130 , where @xmath28 is the average blob size in the asymptotic limit @xmath62 ( we perform the same extrapolation as done before for the ratios @xmath131 ) .",
    "results for several values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 are shown in table  [ ratiorg ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : ratiorg ] versus the blob volume fraction @xmath132 . at least for @xmath133 the data appear to depend only on @xmath134 and to converge to 1 linearly as @xmath135 : @xmath136 . since @xmath135 for @xmath137 at fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "this result allows us to predict the ratio @xmath138 , the average of the @xmath139 defined above , as @xmath137 .",
