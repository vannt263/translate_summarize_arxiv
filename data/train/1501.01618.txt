    "<S> it is shown that a weakly interacting massive dark matter particle ( wimp ) interpretation for the positron excess observed in a variety of experiments , heat , pamela , and ams-02 , is highly constrained by the fermi / lat observations of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this paper has focused on the annihilation channels that best fit the current ams-02 data ( boudaud et  al . , </S>",
    "<S> 2014 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi satellite has surveyed the @xmath0-ray sky , and its observations of dwarf satellites are used to place strong bounds on the annihilation of wimps into a variety of channels . for the single channel case , we find that dark matter annihilation into @xmath1-@xmath2 or @xmath3-@xmath4 is ruled out as an explanation of the ams positron excess ( here @xmath5 quarks are a proxy for all quarks , gauge and higgs bosons ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the fermi / lat 2@xmath6 upper limits , assuming the best - fit ams-02 branching ratios , exclude multichannel combinations into @xmath7 and leptons </S>",
    "<S> . the tension between the results might relax if the branching ratios are allowed to deviate from their best - fit values , though a substantial change would be required . </S>",
    "<S> of all the channels we considered , the only viable channel that survives the fermi / lat constraint and produces a good fit to the ams-02 data is annihilation ( via a mediator ) to 4-@xmath8 , or mainly to 4-@xmath8 in the case of multichannel combinations .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as the lightest supersymmetric particles ( for reviews , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , are thought to be the best motivated dark matter ( dm ) candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the particles in consideration are their own antiparticles ; thus , they annihilate among themselves in the early universe and naturally provide the correct relic density today to explain the dark matter of the universe . this same annihilation process takes place in the present universe wherever the dm density is sufficiently high and is the basis for dm indirect detection searches . </S>",
    "<S> indirect detection experiments search for the annihilation products of dark matter particles , including electrons and/or positrons , antiprotons , photons , and neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> promising sites for the observation of dark matter annihilation products include the core of the sun @xcite , the earth  @xcite , our galactic halo  @xcite , galactic center  @xcite , dwarf satellite galaxies  @xcite , and from dm substructures  @xcite .    over the past several years </S>",
    "<S> , there have been a number of experimental signals which have been interpreted as possible indications of dm . </S>",
    "<S> confirmation that any of these observations are actually due to dm , rather than being a mere experimental artifact or astrophysical background , would likely require more than one experiment to provide complementary information . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the anomalous features in the spectrum of cosmic ray positrons and electrons reported by ams-02 @xcite , pamela  @xcite , and the large area telescope of the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fermi / lat )  @xcite ( as well as in earlier indications from heat  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the positron fraction was found to be a steadily increasing function of energy , above 10  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is difficult to explain with standard astrophysical mechanisms , in which positrons are secondary particles , produced in the interactions of primary cosmic rays during the propagation in the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> these observations have led to a great deal of speculation that dm annihilations   @xcite or decays   @xcite may be responsible . </S>",
    "<S> however , any explanation of these positron / electron signals in terms of dm annihilation requires somewhat nonstandard wimp properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the local halo density of dm within the vicinity of the solar system is insufficient to produce these observations unless the annihilation cross section is considerably larger than that typically expected for a thermal relic , or the annihilation rate is otherwise supplemented by a large boost factor @xmath9 . such an enhancement could arise due to astrophysics ; for example , due to substructures in the dm distribution ; yet ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argues that the probability of such a nearby dm clump is @xmath10% . in this paper , we will instead focus on the possibility of an annihilation cross - section that is enhanced by the required boost factor compared to the standard thermal annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , only a handful of possibilities can explain the spectral shape reported by ams-02 and pamela , as well as avoid overproducing antiprotons ( in excess of what is observed ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most well - studied approach to satisfying all these constraints has been leptophilic dm , i.e.  the dm annihilations proceed largely to leptons ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , which do not produce any antiprotons . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , other annihilations channels  quarks , vector and higgs bosons  are allowed if the dm particle is heavier than @xmath1310  tev , producing antiprotons at higher energies than those probed by ams-02 data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> other explanations of the cosmic ray positron excess ( henceforth crpe ) have also been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the most plausible is that it is due to pulsars @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> positrons can ultimately be produced by dm annihilating into a variety of channels : single channels ( leptons , quarks , gauge bosons , higgs , or four leptons ) or a mix of these channels . prior to 2014 , when the most recent ams-02 results became available , all annihilation channels could provide explanations for the positron excess ( see table  2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most popularly studied cases were wimp masses @xmath13200  gev , which matched the data only for leptophilic channels ( dm annihilates only into leptons @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , though quark and gauge boson channels well fit the data at higher wimp masses , with best - fit masses as high as @xmath1350200  tev ( depending on the channel ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent ams-02 data release @xcite has greatly improved our understanding of the positron excess . as stressed by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , two major improvements have emerged . </S>",
    "<S> first the new data are far more accurate and extend out to 500  gev , much higher energies than previously explored . </S>",
    "<S> improved accuracy in the positron spectrum leads to stronger constraints on any model for the origin of the positrons . </S>",
    "<S> second , ams-02 has measured directly the total electron and positron flux , the denominator in the positron fraction , reducing systematic errors and leading to differences in best - fit regions for the dm mass and cross section . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite further stressed the importance of addressing uncertainties in the cosmic ray ( cr ) propagation model , as these models are of critical importance in assessing the true nature of the positron excess .    </S>",
    "<S> boudaud et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have performed an analysis with the new ams-02 data , exploring the dm models that could explain the crpe . </S>",
    "<S> compared to earlier data and analyses , the recent ams-02 data do indeed lead to much stronger constraints on suitable dm candidates that can explain the @xmath16 excess and the best - fit masses have shifted by a fair amount . primarily these authors used the benchmark set of cr propagation model parameters known as med in obtaining their results ; this is the model that best fits the b / c ratio in the cosmic rays . with the recent , more accurate data and using med </S>",
    "<S> , these authors found that many of the earlier allowed models have been ruled out ( see table  1 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in terms of single channel models , </S>",
    "<S> leptophillic dm is no longer viable , whereas single channel annihilation into quarks and gauge bosons provide an excellent fit to the crpe . </S>",
    "<S> they also considered the case of dm annihilation into a mediator particle @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with @xmath19 , thus yielding four leptons per annihilation ( `` 4-lepton '' channel ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , single channel annihilation into four leptons does not fit the ams-02 data ( assuming med propagation ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , annihilation into a combination of channels can also provide an excellent fit , in particular annihilation into an admixture of leptons and @xmath7 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a combination of four lepton channels ( arising from a mediator field @xmath17 ) , specifically the four - tau ( 75% ) and four - electron ( 25% ) channel , turns out to provide a good fit to the ams-02 data for a dm mass between 0.5 and 1  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the results reprised in this paragraph all refer to the med cr propagation model .    </S>",

    "<S> the best - fit ams-02 points for these annihilation channels are shown by the red circles . </S>",
    "<S> empty circles are for the med propagation parameters and filled circles are for the best - fit propagation parameters @xcite ; the dm parameters do not differ much between the two cases for any of the channels . the ams-02 @xmath5 and @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> best - fit points are excluded by the fermi / lat constraints , while the @xmath63 and @xmath8 points are not . </S>",
    "<S> the two lighter lepton channels fail to be excluded by fermi / lat because they provide positrons in abundance for the ams-02 signal , while photon production is suppressed , leading to little expected sensitivity to these channels via @xmath0-ray searches . </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding fermi / lat 2@xmath6 upper limits , assuming the best - fit brs , are shown in blue dashed and dotted curves . the ams-02 best - fit @xmath24 and brs are strongly excluded by the fermi / lat results . </S>",
    "<S> this does not rigorously imply the ams-02 and fermi / lat results are in strong conflict for all multi - channel cases , as the fermi / lat constraints will vary if the brs are allowed to deviate from their best - fit values . </S>",
    "<S> however , bringing the two results into compatibility will require the @xmath7 channel to be heavily suppressed , as well as the @xmath66 channel at the lighter end of the mass range , which is quite different from the best - fit case , where @xmath7 dominates at higher masses and @xmath7 + @xmath66 accounts for @xmath70% of the annihilations at lower masses .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:4l ] examines the mediated 4-lepton case with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the 4-@xmath20 fermi / lat upper limit is shown by the solid blue curve . due to the complexity of implementing their non - leading - order photon production mechanisms , we have foregone the calculation of limits for the 4-@xmath63 and 4-@xmath8 cases </S>",

    "<S> the caveats discussed for the @xmath7+@xmath53 case previously apply here : allowing the brs to vary from their best - fit values will change the fermi / lat constraints and could potentially bring these experimental results into line for this model . </S>",

    "<S> an example where this happens is the predominantly 4-@xmath8 case which remains a viable model .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to bounds from @xmath0-rays and antiprotons already discussed , there are other observational constraints on a dm interpretation of the @xmath16 excess seen in ams-02 . </S>",

    "<S> papers from the planck satellite with extremely strong bounds are expected and could rule out the dm scenario completely .    in summary , we have used the fermi / lat dwarf galaxy data in order to constrain dark matter as an explanation of the positron excess seen in heat , pamela , and ams-02 . in particular , this paper has focused on the annihilation channels that best fit the current ams-02 data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first considered the single channel case of dm annihilating directly to @xmath7 and leptons @xmath53 , as well as to 4-leptons ( via a mediator @xmath17 ) ; we then considered the multi - channel case where annihilation proceeds through a combination of channels . </S>",
    "<S> we used @xmath74 as our proxy for all other quarks , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons , since the spectra and amplitudes are similar , but considered each lepton flavor separately . </S>",
    "<S> for the single channel case , we found that dark matter annihilation into @xmath1-@xmath2 or @xmath3-@xmath4 can not both provide a good fit to ams-02 and avoid the 2@xmath6 upper limit from fermi / lat . </S>",
    "<S> the ams-02 best - fit brs and @xmath24 used for the analysis of this paper assume either the med propagation model defined in refs .  @xcite or the best - fit propagation parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multi - channel annihilations are also highly constrained by fermi / lat s measurement of @xmath0-ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> we use the med propagation model parameters for the mixed channel cases , but doubt that other reasonable choices of cr propagation parameters would change our results . specifically , we find that the fermi / lat 2@xmath6 upper limits , assuming the best - fit ams-02 brs , exclude the annihilation into a combination of @xmath7 and the three leptons for dm masses 600  gev @xmath75 100  tev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the fermi / lat upper limit is incompatible with the ams-02 best fit @xmath24 and brs for annihilation into a mix of the mediator driven 4-lepton channels except for very high masses ( @xmath76  tev ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not rigorously imply that the results from ams-02 and fermi / lat are in strong conflict for all multi - channel cases , as the fermi / lat constraints will vary if the brs are allowed to deviate from their best fit ams-02 values . in order to reconcile both experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the brs considered would have to deviate significantly from their best - fit values . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dark matter annhiliation into 4-@xmath8 provides a good fit to the ams-02 data and escapes fermi / lat constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the 4-@xmath8 channel escaping fermi / lat upper limits is that it provides positrons in abundance for the ams-02 signal , while photon production is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for the best - fit br to the ams-02 data , we find only one viable dm annihilation channel that survives fermi / lat constraints and provides a good fit to the current ams-02 data : the 4-@xmath8 channel .    </S>",
    "<S> we briefly mention ways around these conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> first , for the mixed channel cases we have only studied the best fits to ams-02 data ( found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that there are other brs that still provide reasonably good fits ( though not the best fits ) to the ams-02 data that are not ruled out by fermi / lat bounds from dwarf spheroidals . a joint statistical analysis of the ams-02 and fermi / lat </S>",
    "<S> would be required to check for other alternatives . </S>",
    "<S> second , although it is extremely unlikely that the boost factor required by the ams-02 data is due to a nearby clump of dm that is 1001000 times as dense as its surroundings , perhaps part of the boost factor is due to a clump of , say , a factor of 10 ( again , unlikely ) . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the required annihilation cross - section to explain the ams-02 data could be lower , and more channels would remain viable . </S>",
    "<S> third , it is possible that part of the ams-02 signal is due to pulsars , and part due to dm annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> again , more dm annihilation channels might then still remain compatible with fermi / lat bounds from dwarf spheroidals . </S>",
    "<S> these latter two caveats would also apply to bounds on these scenarios from the cmb including those expected from upcoming planck data . </S>"
