    "euclidean quantum gravity provides an approach to some of the most fundamental issues in cosmology .",
    "one of these is the question of the initial state of the universe , both for the background geometry and for the fluctuations .",
    "euclidean methods have long been applied to calculations of quantum fluctuations in inflation , and to tunnelling problems in de sitter space .",
    "a recent development was the observation that a generic theory of scalar matter coupled to gravity allows a one - parameter family of singular but finite action euclidean instantons which can be used to describe the beginning of inflating open or closed universes@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the free parameter in these solutions is just the value of the cosmological density parameter @xmath6 today .",
    "the singular nature of these instantons is a cause for concern since it is not clear whether the classical field equations are satisfied at the singularity . in references",
    "@xcite it was argued that the solutions should be regarded as constrained instantons , described by a collective coordinate to be integrated over in the path integral .    in this paper",
    "we clarify what the collective coordinate is and how it is to be integrated over .",
    "the singularity is resolved by a conformal transformation .",
    "the original ` einstein frame ' metric equals a regular underlying metric times a conformal factor with a linear zero of codimension one .",
    "the regular metric describes an @xmath0 and the conformal factor is taken to be a section of the nontrivial @xmath7 orientation bundle over @xmath0 . because of the nontrivial twist",
    ", the action is not guaranteed to be stationary for solutions of the classical differential equations of motion : additional data enters on a nontrivial three manifold upon which the conformal factor vanishes .",
    "we draw an analogy with magnetic monopole solutions on @xmath8 , where one also has a one parameter family of solutions to the classical field equations of varying action . in our case ,",
    "when we stationarise the action with respect to the free parameter , we find a lowest action classical solution .",
    "we extend these considerations to instantons representing the beginning of closed inflationary universes , with topology corresponding to @xmath2 $ ] with cross caps at either end .    allowing the conformal factor to vanish",
    "is clearly incompatible with having a a globally riemannian manifold with positive definite metric . however , there are reasons for believing that in a quantum theory of geometry such behaviour is inevitable",
    ". our best examples of such geometrical theories are string theory , and two plus one dimensional gravity . in the former , if one takes the lorentzian path integral seriously , it is not possible to have a globally lorentzian metric on worldsheets with genus not equal to one .",
    "there must be singular points at which the determinant of the world - sheet metric vanishes .",
    "likewise , in two plus one dimensional gravity , it has long been argued that one should also take into account vierbeins which have vanishing determinant .",
    "we believe that the interpretation given here resolves some other worries which have been expressed regarding singular instantons .",
    "since the singularity introduces a ` conformal boundary ' , besides apparently violating the intent of the ` no boundary ' proposal , conformally coupled radiation might be able to enter or leave the spacetime in an arbitrary manner . in our interpretation , where the apparent ` conformal boundary ' has antipodal points identified , the underlying smooth manifold is compact and there is no boundary .",
    "likewise the concern raised by vilenkin @xcite that a ` necklace ' of constrained instantons would have arbitrarily negative euclidean action is also resolved because the number of surfaces on which the constraint enters is determined topologically . for solutions of maximal @xmath9 symmetry , the number of such surfaces can only be 0 , 1 or 2 and we shall discuss the last two cases here . in our construction ,",
    "` necklaces ' do not occur as solutions of the classical field equations .",
    "the singular instantons described in @xcite are o(4 ) invariant solutions with line element ds^2= d^2 + b^2()d _ 3 ^ 2 [ eq : emetric ] where @xmath10 is the round three sphere metric .",
    "the euclidean field equations governing the metric and scalar field @xmath11 are b_,=- ( _ , ^2 + v ( ) ) , b_,^2 = ( 12 _ , ^2 -v ( ) ) + 1 , ( _ , b^3 ) _ , = b^3 v _ , ( ) .",
    "[ eq : fes ] here and below we set @xmath12 where @xmath13 is newton s constant .",
    "as long as the potential @xmath14 is not too steep at large @xmath11 there is a one parameter family of finite action solutions in which the scalar field starts at some @xmath15 and then rolls uphill .",
    "the scale factor @xmath16 at the regular pole of the instanton , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , @xmath20 takes the form of a deformed sine function .",
    "as @xmath21 approaches its second zero , the scalar field s motion is antidamped and it runs off to infinity . at the singularity @xmath22 ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath21 vanishes as @xmath23 , and @xmath11 diverges logarithmically , @xmath24 . from this behaviour",
    "it follows that @xmath25 tends to a constant at the singularity .",
    "this constant will turn out to be the ` radius squared ' of the zero conformal factor locus in the regular underlying metric , and will play the role of the collective coordinate mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the divergence of @xmath11 , and of the ricci scalar for the metric at the singular point @xmath22 , may seem physically unreasonable , but the finiteness of the action tells us that we should take these singularities seriously since they are not obviously suppressed in the path integral .",
    "in fact we shall show that by a suitable change of variables on superspace , the singularity may be removed thus making the action finite term by term .",
    "another possible complaint is that we have no reason to suppose simple behaviour for the potential @xmath14 at field values much greater than the planck mass .",
    "but whilst the singular instanton solutions do probe arbitrarily large values of @xmath11 , calculations of observable quantities such as the density perturbations are very insensitive to the precise form of the potential at large @xmath11 , precisely because the potential itself ( provided it is not very steep ) plays very little role in the vicinity of the singularity . in any case , the theory applies virtually unchanged to potentials which are bounded above and therefore never produced super - planckian energy densities .",
    "a clue to the interpretation of singular instantons is obtained by rewriting the metric in the form @xmath26 .",
    "one sets @xmath27 , thus @xmath28 . from this",
    "it follows that as one approaches the singularity , @xmath29 vanishes linearly with @xmath30 , so that the singularity is a _ linear zero of the conformal factor , of codimension one_. solutions with singularities of the same character were discovered in supergravity some time ago .",
    "they describe two dimensional ` tear - drop compactifications ' of ten dimensional supergravity @xcite . as noted by those authors ,",
    "although the relevant manifolds are noncompact , they possess many desirable properties , including a quantised mass spectrum and unbroken supersymmetry to protect against quantum fluctuations .",
    "( incidentally they also have a chiral spectrum of zero modes , and were in some respects the antecedents of the now more popular orbifold compactifications of eleven dimensional supergravity ) .",
    "the simple nature of the singularity suggests the interpretation we shall explore below , namely that the conformal factor is a field forced to vanish by a topological constraint .",
    "we discuss a suitable constraint in the next section .",
    "it is a familiar notion that in infinite space , field theories with degenerate vacua possess topologically stable soliton solutions .",
    "the condition of finite energy forces the fields to lie in vacuo at infinity .",
    "if the map defined by the fields at infinity onto the vacuum manifold is topologically nontrivial , the field is forced to vanish at isolated points , and solitons occur at these points .",
    "solitons like these are in general only strictly stable if space is infinite .",
    "but on finite spaces it is still possible to have zeros enforced topologically , and therefore have topologically stable solitons .",
    "this occurs if the field configuration is ` twisted ' .",
    "this option exists if there are noncontractible loops on the manifold , and if fields can aquire a minus sign as these loops are traversed . in mathematical terminology a twisted field is a section of a nontrivial fibre bundle , requiring more than one coordinate chart for its definition . the simplest case is a scalar field theory on a circle with a @xmath7 internal symmetry @xmath31 .",
    "we have two choices of boundary conditions for @xmath11 - periodic or antiperiodic , see figure ( [ fig : circle ] ) .",
    "both are equally natural because there is no physical distinction between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as the coordinate increases by the length @xmath34 of the circle",
    ", there is no reason to match @xmath11 to @xmath32 rather than @xmath33 . in the first case ,",
    "the configuration space is a trivial bundle over @xmath35 , but in the second it is a nontrivial bundle , and the scalar field aquires a @xmath36 as one passes through the single nontrivial coordinate transition . in the path integral",
    "there is no reason not to sum over both the twisted and untwisted sectors .",
    "[ fig : circle ]    in the twisted sector of a @xmath7 symmetric scalar field theory , the field must vanish somewhere .",
    "the interesting case is where the scalar potential yields spontaneous symmetry breaking , for example @xmath37 . in this case , at least for large @xmath34 , energetic considerations prefer that the the field be nonzero over most of space . in the twisted sector one must have an odd number of zeros of @xmath11 , whereas in the untwisted sector there must be an even number . for finite @xmath34 the two vacua involved in each case will mix quantum mechanically , with the symmetric state being the ground state .",
    "the theory therefore splits into sectors labelled by a @xmath7 topological charge , equal to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of zeros .    to define the action for twisted fields",
    ", one must add the contributions from each coordinate patch .",
    "only one of the two transitions between coordinate patches is nontrivial , so one may take the action to be a single integral evaluated in a single patch , running from @xmath40 to @xmath34 .",
    "the only problem is that we have to differentiate the field across the special point @xmath41 , identified with @xmath42 .",
    "the twisted field must undergo a sign change as one crosses this point .",
    "the way to differentiate is to note that within a single coordinate patch the derivative is defined as usual as @xmath43 lim@xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "but if one differentiates across the singular point , one must include a compensating minus sign , using instead lim@xmath44 @xmath46 .",
    "we define the latter as the covariant derivative of the field , @xmath47 .",
    "( one could instead insert the minus sign in front of @xmath48 , which would reverse the sign of @xmath47 .",
    "but like @xmath11 itself , @xmath47 is only defined up to a sign and nothing physical changes if one reverses it . )",
    "the action is then given by = dx .",
    "[ eq : acttw ]    [ fig : twisted ]    for example , choosing the singular point to be located at @xmath49 the action is an integral running from @xmath40 to @xmath34 .",
    "it is varied subject to the boundary constraint that @xmath50 in the untwisted and twisted cases , obtaining = _ 0^l + _ 0^l dx .",
    "[ eq : acttv ] the action is stationary under all field variations about a classical solution @xmath51 if @xmath51 obeys the classical field equations away from @xmath41 and if @xmath52 , which is just the requirement that the covariant derivative be continuous .    for each value of @xmath34 there is a stationary configuration in the twisted sector . for small @xmath34",
    "this configuration is just @xmath53 .",
    "this configuration is common to both the twisted and untwisted sectors , but it is only stable in the twisted sector because the destabilising negative mode @xmath54 constant is disallowed by the twisted boundary conditions .    for larger @xmath55 one can easily check that @xmath53 is unstable to a twisted negative mode , and the lowest action solution spontaneously breaks the @xmath7 , taking the form shown in figure 2 , with a single zero of the scalar field .",
    "we shall show that this solution provides a stable twisted classical vacuum . in the gauge where @xmath11 is continuous",
    "there is a ` kink ' @xmath56 at the zero of @xmath11 , which looks like a charged source coupling to @xmath11 .",
    "but this ` charge ' is just a reflection of the change of coordinate chart across the zero .    to find the minimum action state it is convenient to label each field configuration by the by the maximal value of @xmath57 . without loss of generality",
    "we can take this value of @xmath58 to be positive .",
    "we can also take the sign flip of the field to occur there .",
    "now the field runs from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , as @xmath61 runs from @xmath40 to @xmath34 .",
    "however note that we can not ( except by working on a larger covering space - see below ) construct a globally valid action involving ordinary integrals and derivatives of the fields .",
    "we have to proceed by first introducing an ` internal boundary ' with the field taking the value @xmath62 , and then treat @xmath62 as a constrained parameter when we vary the action to obtain the field equations .",
    "we start by assuming the field is monotonic .",
    "now we write the action integral as _ 0^l dx 12 (  - ) ^2 + 2 _ 0^_m d + l v_m , [ eq : acttwa ] where @xmath63 . the first term is positive semidefinite . the action is then bounded below by the value of the second two terms , which we may minimise with respect to @xmath62 . for any @xmath62 , the first term is minimised by an appropriate solution of the classical field equations . for the @xmath62 which minimises the second two terms ,",
    "the minimum of the first term is zero .",
    "any other field configuration clearly has larger action and therefore the classical solution is absolutely stable .",
    "if we minimise the second two terms we find v_,(_m ) ( 2 _ 0^_m d -l)=0 . [ eq : phieqb ] the nontrivial solution is that which occurs when @xmath64 is not zero .",
    "if this solution exists , we can show it is a minimum by changing variables in the integral to @xmath65 which runs from @xmath40 to @xmath66 .",
    "after absorbing the @xmath62 in the denominator , the only @xmath62 dependence is in the quartic ( or more generally the non - quadratic terms ) of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "hence we see that the first term in ( [ eq : phieqb ] ) is monotonically increasing with @xmath62 .",
    "this , with the fact that @xmath64 is negative , proves that the second two terms in ( [ eq : acttwa ] ) increase away from the stationary point .",
    "the minimum of the the first term in ( [ eq : acttwa ] ) is obtained when the bogomolny equation @xmath69 holds . by integrating this",
    "we obtain a relation between @xmath34 and @xmath62 .",
    "but this is precisely the condition that the bracketed term in ( [ eq : phieqb ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus the solution to the bogomolny equation minimises the action .",
    "we assumed monotonicity above but it is not hard to show that the energy is always greater for non - monotonic configurations .",
    "notice that stability depends on the higher power terms in the potential - a purely quadratic potential does not allow any nontrivial classical solution except @xmath53 .",
    "in the example we have chosen one can perform the integrals as elliptic integrals k and exhibit the ` critical behaviour ' in @xmath62 for @xmath34 just above @xmath70 , @xmath71 , with action proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "note that it was useful in this analyis to label field configurations by the maximal field value @xmath62 , separately minimising the action with respect to @xmath62 on the ` internal boundary ' and with respect to variations away from the boundary .",
    "the bogomolny equation for example explicitly depends on @xmath62 .",
    "this is not a procedure one is used to for untwisted fields , because the ground state configuration is trivial and independent of @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast the twisted vacuum depends strongly on @xmath34 , even exhibiting a ` phase transition ' at @xmath73 .    in the gravitational instanton case",
    "we shall adopt a similar strategy , with @xmath62 replaced by the maximal value of a certain field @xmath74 which shall be twisted .",
    "the size of the instanton , analogous to @xmath34 , will also be integrated over .",
    "hence we find a one parameter family of classical solutions for each value of either the maximal field value or alternatively the size of the instanton .",
    "the action is minimised by one particular solution of the classical field equations .    for a twisted scalar field on a circle",
    ", we could have represented the problem on the covering space , a circle twice as large , where we used only the odd fourier modes for the twisted field . in the nonorientable four dimensional example below this option",
    "is not available to us , since we wish to consider an action density which is odd under the @xmath7 .",
    "if we integrated naively on the covering space we would obtain zero .",
    "instead we must include an orientation flip factor in the integral , which effectively reduces it to one over half the covering space .",
    "the @xmath7 we discussed in the previous section was a purely internal symmetry .",
    "next we shall identify a similar @xmath7 symmetry acting on the conformal factor and related to orientation reversals for coordinate patches covering a non - orientable manifold .",
    "we are interested in viewing the conformal factor as a twisted field .",
    "we therefore consider metrics of the form g _",

    "we shall in what follows refer to geometrical quantities calculated in the metric @xmath77 as being in the ` riemannian frame ' , using terminology analogous to that used in string theory where one considers the ` string frame ' or ` einstein frame ' , which are related by a conformal transformation involving the dilaton field .",
    "we consider a theory with a local @xmath7 symmetry , where the @xmath7 involves changing orientation and , in the twisted sector of the theory , reversing the sign of @xmath78 .",
    "with such a local symmetry we can always choose @xmath78 to be positive everywhere except at conformal zeros .",
    "therefore we are not considering ` anti - euclidean ' or ` mixed signature ' spacetimes , but we are allowing zeros of the conformal factor to be topologically enforced . to carry @xmath79 rather than @xmath80 charge will lead to stable codimension two string worldsheet conformal zeros wrapped on noncontractible two cycles in spacetime .",

    "the gravitational / scalar action density ( discussed below ) involves terms linear in @xmath78 and is therefore odd under the @xmath7 .",
    "the only way to compensate for a sign change @xmath81 is to have the the integration measure @xmath82 change sign under the same @xmath7 .",
    "this means that for the action to be invariant the orientation of the coordinate system must change each time @xmath78 changes sign .",
    "twisted fields by definition undergo an odd number of sign changes as one circumnavigates the background space along certain noncontractible paths .",
    "if @xmath82 is to do the same , the manifold must be non - orientable , and we must identify the @xmath7 of the twisted line bundle with the @xmath7 of the orientation bundle .",
    "@xmath0 is the obvious candidate manifold , obtained from @xmath83 by identifying antipodal points .",
    "there is no global choice for orientation on it .",
    "the orientation bundle over @xmath0 has a @xmath7 structure group , and we shall identify some scalar fields ( including @xmath78 ) as odd and twisted under this @xmath7 . we shall obtain an invariant action in the twisted sector , and the singular instantons of section ii will emerge as solutions of the classical field equations in this sector .

    "a sphere may be projectively mapped in a one to one manner onto the surface of a cube .",
    "@xmath84 is then formed from three faces of the cube by identifying edges as shown in the diagram on the left in figure ( [ fig : rp2 ] ) .",
    "we can further simplify the diagram by mapping the whole onto a disk as on the right of figure ( [ fig : rp2 ] ) .",
    "the coordinate patches may be extended into small overlap regions .",
    "each of the three patches connects to the other two via two alternate overlap regions .",
    "the first involves crossing the labelled boundary @xmath85 and a change in orientation , jacobian @xmath86 being negative .",
    "the other does not , and the jacobian is positive .",
    "( this is made clear by using the obvious cartesian coordinates on the three faces of the cube ) .",
    "the second important feature is that there is a class of noncontractible @xmath87 s on @xmath84 , the most obvious member of which is the @xmath87 boundary @xmath85 of the three faces shown in figure ( [ fig : rp2 ] ) with appropriate identifications .",
    "( note that @xmath87 is isomorphic to @xmath35 : but the same is not true of @xmath88 for @xmath89 ) .",
    "more generally any closed path in @xmath84 which intersects the @xmath87 an odd number of times is noncontractible , and as one travels along it one must pass through an odd number of nontrivial coordinate transitions .",
    "an important check that we have a consistent fibre bundle is that the product of @xmath7 group elements in triple overlap regions , @xmath90 should be unity .",
    "this is indeed satisfied here because in such a triple overlap ( shaded region on the right of figure ( [ fig : rp2 ] ) two of the transitions involve a charge of orientation and the other does not . in the case of @xmath0",
    "the construction is completely analogous except we take half of the faces of a five dimensional hypercube .",

    "i d^4x_i l_i [ eq : acti ] where the sum runs over coordinate patches , and the integral is broken into non - overlapping pieces with common boundaries within the coordinate overlaps .",
    "if the lagrangian density is a twisted scalar , then moving these boundaries around the manifold does not change the action since the minus sign from the jacobian @xmath91 is compensated for by the minus sign aquired by the lagrangian density .",

    "the function @xmath94 effectively introduces a boundary into the problem , which is as we have explained an @xmath1 since twisted or untwisted fields must be odd or even parity on it as well .",

    "the second relates to the freedom we had to place the three - surface on which @xmath94 switches sign on any even parity three surface ( figure ( [ fig : coverspace ] ) ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check the solution with least action is the one with the zero of @xmath116 located on the three - surface upon which @xmath94 flips sign .",
    "this is seen by substituting the constraint ( [ eq : eomsc ] ) back into the action ( [ eq : actiona ] ) and noting that the resulting integrand is proportional to @xmath189 . for small @xmath74",
    "the first term dominates and the action density is negative just above the equator , positive below it . the most negative action is therefore obtained by placing the @xmath1 on the equator i.e. the conformal zero , so that the solution has non - negative conformal factor @xmath78 in the entire oriented coordinate patch being considered .",
    "an interesting generalisation of the above construction is obtained by considering the case where the underlying four dimensional manifold is @xmath190 $ ] , with each end of the resulting cylinder completed by a @xmath3 crosscap .",
    "the @xmath3 crosscap can be thought of as either the total space of the twisted line bundle over @xmath1 with fibres trimmed to finite length , or as the space remaining when a single point is removed from @xmath0 .",
