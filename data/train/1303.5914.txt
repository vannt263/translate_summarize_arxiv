    "one of sakharov s condition of existence of the universe as we know it , is baryon number violation  @xcite .",
    "it seems indisputable from the observation of the baryonic matter over antimatter dominance , if the universe got nonzero baryon charge at early evolution stage .",
    "however , if the dark matter of the universe ( dm ) is antibaryonic , and consisting of exactly the same number of antiquarks as usual matter does , this sakharov s requirement is no more obligatory .",
    "such opportunity can be only justified if dm antibaryons satisfy the following conditions : they are stable ( at least at the universe lifetime scale ) and neutral ; their annihilation with normal matter is an extremely rare phenomenon ; moreover , negative results of direct searches for dark matter place upper limits on cross section of dm elastic scattering off baryons .",
    "in this letter we consider a minor modification of the standard model ( sm ) where dm can be formed by antibaryons .",
    "namely , we examine the sm with 4 generations of quarks ( sm4 )  , which was widely discussed in literature , and argue that baryons built from the heaviest quark generation ( @xmath1  and @xmath2 ) can be light , stable and invisible .    with baryon number conserved , there should be a parity of `` light '' baryons and `` dark '' antibaryons in the universe .",
    "we thus conclude from measurement of dm mass density in the universe ( about 5 times higher than baryonic mass density @xcite ) that `` dark '' antibaryons should have mass of about 5gev .",
    "one and the same mechanism  antibaryon formation  is responsible for both dm and baryon asymmetry generations in the early universe .",
    "it is worth noting that since in the model the baryon number enters both matter components ( baryonic and dark ) , it naturally explains the coincidence ( within one order of magnitude ) of visible and dark matter contributions to the present density of the universe .",
    "the idea of baryon - symmetric universe @xcite was extensively studied in literature , and several mechanism to generate antibaryonic dark matter have been suggested , for a recent review see @xcite . in our model",
    "a specific production mechanism does the job , and the phenomenology is different except the main signature of all antibaryonic dark matter models : an induced nucleon decay .",
    "light @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks in the normal baryons ( protons and neutrons ) are bound by the strong interaction . for baryons consisting heavy @xmath1  and @xmath2",
    "quarks the extra huge binding energy arises due to the scalar exchange between each pair of quarks .",
    "indeed , scalar fields provide attractive forces between fermions with the strength proportional to the product of yukawa couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ increasing with the fermion masses .",
    "the naive ( perturbative ) estimates of the binding energy of two heavy quarks @xmath5 due to light scalar exchange is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is quark mass , @xmath8 is its yukawa coupling to the light scalar ( like in the sm , the sm4 quark masses are proportional to the yukawa constants , @xmath9 )",
    ". the bound state of heavy quarks will be much lighter than the sum of quark masses because of large negative value of this binding energy , that can be even of the order of the sum of the quark masses : _",
    "e.g. _ a meson - like _ light _ bound state of 6 @xmath10-quarks and 6 @xmath10-antiquarks was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a more economic configuration of heavy quarks bound by strong scalar exchange is a bubble of the false vacuum @xmath11 , surrounded by domain wall , inside which massless fourth generation quarks are confined . indeed , in this case instead of quark masses the energy of the false vacuum bubble contributes to the configuration mass .",
    "the later may be much smaller than the sum of the quark masses if the radius of the bubble is small .",
    "below we describe a toy model where such a configuration might be realized .",
    "we assume factorization of quark fields and the domain wall between true and false vacua by localizing quarks inside a sphere of radius @xmath12 , where the coupled to quarks scalar @xmath13 ( higgs field ) is fixed to zero .",
    "we thus estimate the energy of the whole system as a sum of two noninteracting parts : quarks and domain wall . because of this factorization",
    ", such toy model overestimates the total energy but is sufficient for our purposes to illustrate the main idea we put forward .    the simple spherically symmetric bubble profile for the scalar field static configuration ( @xmath14 ) is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fields]a ) for @xmath15tev@xmath16 as an example .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     from the lep data the @xmath17-boson partial width to invisible final state except for three neutrino is below @xmath18  @xcite , hence `` @xmath17-charge '' of the lightest baryon ( which is much lighter than half of @xmath17 mass , according to our arguments ) should be exactly zero . there is only one such a candidate in the table[list ] : @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21  baryon .",
    "it is also electrically neutral that is one of the necessary conditions to be dm",
    ". other baryons ( if exist ) with non - zero coupling to @xmath17 should be heavier than @xmath22 .    one can expect that most combinations listed in the table[list ] do not form bound states .",
    "eight out of the twelve listed candidates include a pair of identical quarks .",
    "such pairs should have symmetric spin wavefunction , as two quarks are spatially symmetric , and color antisymmetric ; thus their total spin is 1 , and there is a spin - spin interaction energy between the remaining third quark and the pair .",
    "strength of the spin - spin interaction is not small in our case of very compact state of relativistic components . among the four remaining configurations the @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21  and @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21  have @xmath24 gauge force _ attractive _ , hence reducing the bound state masses .",
    "the former configuration ( our dm ) is naturally lighter , as attractive @xmath25 force also reduces its mass , while repulsive @xmath25 force increases the mass of charged baryon @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "we conclude that natural candidate to be dm is @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "its binding energy is determined mostly by @xmath2quark yukawa coupling @xmath26 , while the mass of @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21 is determined by @xmath1-quark yukawa @xmath27 .",
    "values of these yukawas ( and hence masses of @xmath1  and @xmath2 ) have to be chosen in such a way that cancellation of quark energy  [ stabil ] for @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 happens at smaller radius @xmath12 ( i.e. at higher energy scale for running couplings ) than for @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21 . then @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21 is much heavier , since the energy of the total configuration is then mostly the bubble energy  [ bubble - energy ] , which grows linearly with @xmath12 .",
    "this consideration suggests that @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 is naturally the lightest of all the baryon configurations listed in table  [ list ] , and hereafter we suppose it is existing and its mass is about 5gev .",
    "in the model the baryon asymmetry of the universe as well as dm component are produced after electroweak phase transition , when the sm higgs field gains nonzero vacuum expectation value and all quarks and weak bosons become massive . because of strong yukawa couplings bound states listed in table[list ] start to form somewhat earlier . when new phase has conquered the space everywhere except inside the bound states , the latter",
    "become massive and decay into lighter bound states and quarks .",
    "it is a nonequilibrium process and as a result the required asymmetry between the lightest bound states @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath28 may be generated with approximately chosen cp - violating parameters in @xmath29 extensions of the ckm matrix . at the same process the rest of baryonic charge transfers to the sm quarks .",
    "then all @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21-baryons annihilate with antibaryonic counterparts leaving a requiring amount of dark matter antibaryons made of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the model under discussion is capable of producing both dm and baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "if even the lightest `` dark '' antibaryon has small mass of @xmath30gev , it is not stable",
    ". such antibaryons can decay to antiproton , strange or charmed antibaryon via simultaneous transitions of all heavy antiquarks to light antiquarks .",
    "such non diagonal transition can be provided only by weak interactions ( a triple @xmath31-emission or simultaneous @xmath31-exchange and @xmath31-emission ) , but one of the antiquark is righthanded and more complicated diagram is required , like that shown in fig .",
    "[ dec ] .",
    "it is extremely suppressed by ckm weak couplings to the first ( second ) generation antiquarks and small yukawa coupling of the second generation .",
    "thus , 5gev antibaryon can ( easily ) be stable at cosmological time scale .",
    "dm particles scatter of each other with cross sections certainly smaller than the geometric estimate @xmath32 .",
    "the number is small enough to satisfy the upper limit from the bullet cluster 1e 0657 - 56  @xcite and to ensure the stability of dark matter at cosmological time scale in the interesting regions with overdensity : inside galaxies and clusters .",
    "likewise annihilation with baryons is ineffective .",
    "however , the latter process is a signature of the antibaryonic dm we propose : annihilation products in cosmic rays may be searched for to test the model",
    ".    there are limits on elastic dm scattering off nuclei from direct searches for galactic dm at ( underground ) laboratories  @xcite .",
    "being decoupled from photon and @xmath17-boson , the dm particles scatter off ordinary matter with very small cross section . also taking into account small energy transfer due to small mass of 5gev ,",
    "one concludes that the standard approach adopted in direct searches for the dark matter particles , with energy release as the main signature , is useless .",
    "more promising are experiments on searches for proton decays : though in our model _ baryon number is perturbatively conserved , _ the annihilation event of dark matter _ antibaryon _ with proton ( neutron ) will resemble baryon decay event very closely : only energy release ( total energy of the `` decay product '' ) is up to 5gev .",
    "in this letter we have argued that dm may be represented by antibaryonic matter , produced by very heavy quarks confined into @xmath33gev bound states , and baryogenesis can be provided without baryon number violation .",
    "neither new ( conserved ) charges nor interactions are involved .",
    "a signature in a super - k - like detector is proton(neutron)-decay - like event but with more energetic outcoming `` decay''-products .",
    "analogous signature anticipated in cosmic rays is annihilation with ordinary matter .",
    "a special study is worth to obtain model predictions for cosmic ray experiments and direct searches .",
    "4th generation of sm fermions must be searched for at lhc : expected mass range is 700 - 900gev , close to the present limits  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics we need to construct the light antibaryons from heavy antiquarks may be provided by strong coupling in yukawa sector , though we have no reliable tools to describe it quantitatively .",
    "hopefully , this can be done using lattice calculations .",
    "note that configurations we operated with are very compact : the antibaryon radius @xmath12 is much smaller than its naive compton wavelength @xmath34 , but is of order of the constituent masses .",
    "one may hope to describe these configurations _ in perturbative regime _ with new degrees of freedom introduced or by extending the setup with extra spatial dimensions , while effective yukawa dynamics on the world 3-brane is at strong coupling .",
