    "to meet its physics goals , the mpd requires good particle identification capabilities covering a large phase space . identification of charged hadrons in the momenta range ( 0.1  2  gev / c ) is achieved by using time - of - flight and momentum measurements as well as the energy loss ( @xmath3 ) from the tpc and it detector systems .",
    "the basic requirements for the tof system are :     high granularity in order to keep the overall system occupancy below 15% ;     good position resolution to provide effective matching of the tof hits with the tpc tracks ;     high geometrical efficiency ;     separation of pions and kaons up to @xmath4 < 1.5 gev / c ;     separation of ( anti)protons up to @xmath4 < 3 gev / c ; and     tof detector elements must function in the magnetic field up to 0.5 t.    the barrel part of the tof is located in the mpd between the time - projection chamber and the electromagnetic calorimeter and has internal radius of 1.45  m from the beam axis .",
    "the barrel is segmented into 14 sectors with the length of 5.9  m. it covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath5 1.4 .",
    "one sector contains two independent modules .",
    "the module consists of two separate volumes : the inner gas box which contains 10 mrpcs arranged at the angle of 6 degrees to the beam axis ; the outer box contains front - end electronics ( fee ) cards , cables , high voltage and gas plugs .",
    "one mrpc with active surface of 640@xmath6300  mm@xmath7 has 24 strips of 10 mm width with pitch of 12.5 mm .",
    "signals are read out from both sides of the strip .",
    "the number of the mrpcs in the barrel is 280 .",
    "the number of fee channels is 13440 .",
    "the total surface of the barrel part of the tof system is @xmath152 m@xmath7",
    ". the occupancy does not exceed 15% and the geometric efficiency of the tof detectors in this arrangement is @xmath8 .",
    "reflections of the differential signal for the : ( a )  double - stack and ( b )  tripple - stack mrpc.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] reflections of the differential signal for the : ( a )  double - stack and ( b )  tripple - stack mrpc.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the mrpc provides high resolution by using the time - over - threshold method only if the analog signal from the detector is minimally distorted on the input of preamplifier .",
    "therefore one needs to provide very good termination of impedance between the strip , the cable and the preamplifier input .",
    "any reflection could cause the wrong estimation of the signal width when the amplitude correction is applied . working with the double stack mrpc with differential signal readout scheme one has to pay attention to the fact that internal and external electrodes have different impedances .",
    "the inner strip is surrounded from both sides by the fiberglass pcb and glass with dielectric constant @xmath9  4 .",
    "the external electrodes have a honeycomb on one side and glass on the other . as a result",
    "the positive and negative parts of the signal propagate with different velocities ( figure  [ fig0:ds]a ) @xcite .",
    "this fact can lead to a worsening of time resolution . in order to reduce the dispersion effect of the positive and negative part of differential signal",
    ", the detector design must be symmetrical .",
    "scheme of the triple - stack mrpc.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    in order to have a large signal and symmetrical geometry we decided to use a triple - stack design of multigap resistive plate chamber ( figure  [ fig1:tsrpc_scheme ] )  @xcite .",
    "each stack of the detector consists of 5 gas gaps with the width of 200  @xmath10 m .",
    "it has glass resistive electrodes with the thickness of 280 @xmath10 m .",
    "thin glass was chosen to improve the rate capability of the detector @xcite .",
    "high voltage is applied to the external glass of each stack . for this purpose",
    ", the outer surface of the glass is coated with a conductive coating with a surface resistance of 5  20 m@xmath11 .",
    "readout strips in the detector are located only on the inner pcbs .",
    "outer pcbs do not have any conductors .",
    "the copper layer inside the cover of the gas box used as a ground in this case .",
    "it was made from the following considerations .",
    "if we include strips on the outer pcbs and connect them with the inner strips , the impedance of the differential transmission line of three stacks becomes very low ( @xmath12).the minimum input impedance of the nino asic @xcite is 30  @xmath13 .",
    "in order to match the impedances of the strip and the nino input is necessary to increase impedance of the transmission line twice , for example by adding a serial resistor of @xmath14 . in turn , the current at the amplifier input will be reduced by half .",
    "another problem of such readout configuration is that the signal velocity propagation on the outer strip is higher than those on the inner strip and as consequence the dispersion of differential signal .",
    "when we use outer strips as a ground , the impedance of differential line corresponds to the impedance of the twisted pair . on the other hand , crosstalk significant increases due to strong capacitive coupling .",
    "terefore we decided to use outer pcb boards without conductor , and to have readout strips only on the inner pcbs .",
    "one pair of the inner strips ( anode and cathode ) has the differential impedance of 55 @xmath13 and well match with parallel connected twin twisted pair cable with the same impedance without termination resistors .",
    "this design has no problem with the reflection of signals from the edges of the strip .",
    "the cathode and anode strips are in identical environment of conductors and dielectrics .",
    "speeds of propagation of the signal along the cathode and anode are equal in such a transmission line ( figure  [ fig0:ds]b ) .",
    "thus , the dispersion of the signal is avoided . because high voltage is applied to all three stacks , signals from the avalanches induce on the inner strips both from the internal and external stacks .",
    "other advantage of this design is that the large number of narrow gaps improve the time resolution of the detector @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the triple - stack mrpc is that we read only the signal of one polarity from the outer stack .",
    "therefore we lose about one third of the total charge produced in all gaps of the triple - stack mrpc .",
    "the 24-channel front - end board ( figure  [ fig2:nino ] ) based on the nino asic was designed .",
    "it has the following features :     stabilization of the supplied voltage ;     overload protection of input channels ;     capacitors on the inputs for the double - end strip readout ; and     monitoring and control of the sensitivity threshold by the slow control system .",
