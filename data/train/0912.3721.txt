    "the original maldacena conjecture @xcite on the ads / cft duality between @xmath4 and string theory on @xmath5 has been extended to a conjectured holographic equivalence between four - dimensional ( 4d ) strongly coupled qcd at large @xmath6 and a 5d weakly interacting gauge theory coupled to gravity on a 5d space @xmath7 not necessarily ( even asymptotically ) @xmath8 .",
    "new ingredients have to be introduced in order to comply with the effective low energy description of a confining theory such as qcd .",
    "one possibility is to modify the background geometry of the dual gravity theory , as in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , or , as in the phenomenological hard - wall ( hw ) models of @xcite and @xcite , one can cut - off the @xmath8 at a finite size , producing confinement and an infinite spectrum of kaluza - klein resonances .",
    "the two cited hw models differ in the implementation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath9 ) , another fundamental ingredient of low energy hadron dynamics . in @xcite , @xmath9 is induced by a 5d scalar field , having the right properties to be the dual of the @xmath10 operator of qcd , whose non - vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is responsible for @xmath9 . in the approach of @xcite , @xmath9 follows from imposing appropriate infrared ( ir ) boundary conditions .    the soft - wall ( sw ) model , proposed in @xcite , is instead a 5d holographic model in which the @xmath8 has no cut - off , but confinement and an infinite spectrum of kaluza - klein resonances are due a non - trivial dilaton background .",
    "the phenomenological advantage of the sw model is the fact that , contrary to the what happens for the kk states of the hw models , the spectrum of resonances follows a linear regge - trajectory , which leads to a better agreement with the corresponding qcd resonance spectrum in the intermediate energy regime .    in any of models above , one boldly conjectures the applicability of the following holographic recipe for the calculation of correlation functions of the dual 4d theory . for every quantum operator @xmath11 in qcd",
    ", there exists a corresponding 5d field @xmath12 , fixed by the boundary condition @xmath13 on the ultraviolet ( uv ) boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "the generating functional of the correlation functions of the 4d theory , is equal to the 5d action evaluated _ on - shell _ : @xmath14\\right)\\equiv\\langle \\mbox{exp}(i\\int d^4 x \\,\\phi_0(x)\\,{\\cal o}(x))\\rangle_{\\rm qcd_4 } = \\mbox{exp}\\left(is_{\\rm m_5}[\\phi_0(x)]\\right ) \\label{holography}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] varying @xmath15 $ ] with respect to the sources @xmath16 , and then setting them to zero , one gets the connected @xmath17-point green s functions of the 4d theory .",
    "having a 5d holographic description of low energy qcd makes compelling the comparison with 4d low energy qcd models : vmd , large @xmath18 , chiral quark model , ... qcd at low energy is described by chiral perturbation theory and thus the question amounts to how good is the prediction for the gasser - leutwyler coefficients , @xmath19 .",
    "it is fair to say that all these models , 4d and 5d , compare fairly well with the @xmath19 s phenomenological values : a more specific question is if the presence of gluonic condensate improves the agreement with phenomenology .",
    "actually this question has a very neat answer in the chiral quark model @xcite : the agreement with phenomenology improves @xcite .",
    "so we think that this is a very well motivated question for holographic qcd .    in the holographic dictionary , 4d condensates , _",
    "i.e. _ non - vanishing vev s of some composite operators of the 4d theory , are related to the behavior near the uv boundary of the dual 5d fields @xcite .",
    "the effect of a gluonic condensate can be induced by a non - trivial dilaton field , or , equivalently , by a suitable deformation of the original @xmath8 metric , as we will discuss in detail .",
    "we shall be concerned with the correction to the two - point functions in presence of small deformations of the 5d metric background . here",
    "small means that we can treat them as perturbations and we shall calculate the first order effect on the two - point function of the theory .",
    "although applicable also to the evaluation of two - point functions of other 4d operators , we shall consider only the case of conserved ( flavor ) currents , @xmath20 .",
    "so , instead of generic 5d actions , we shall consider only the case of hw models with 5d vector gauge fields , as they are the fields dual to these currents .",
    "after a a short review of the holographic prescription in sec .",
    "2 , we compute in sec.3 the first order correction to the vector two - point function and show how to cast them in a very compact form .",
    "with hindsight , we justify the result deriving it directly from the holographic prescription .",
    "we present also another approach to evaluate directly how the metric deformation affects masses and decay constants of the vector resonances , which appear as intermediate states in the bound - state expansion of the two - point function .",
    "we do it by developing perturbation theory for the resonance wave - functions .",
    "the resulting formulae differ from those of usual perturbation theory , since a deformation of the metric affects also the scalar product of wave - functions .",
    "the interest of this approach lies not only in the fact that it provides a different route to the evaluation of the perturbation of resonance masses and decay constants , which could be alternatively extracted from the behavior of the perturbed two - point around its singularities : in fact , since it directly provides the perturbed wave - functions , it allows , for instance , the evaluation of the effects of the metric deformation on other low energy coupling such as the two - pion - one - vector coupling .",
    "the formal equivalence of the two methods is shown in the appendix .    in sect.4",
    ", we consider first the case of an hw model with flat 5d metric .",
    "it is computationally simpler and we use it to illustrate our methods in the evaluation of the corrections to resonance masses and decay constants : these results are original .",
    "we then examine the case of hw model where the extra - dimension is an @xmath8 slice @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also consider some effects on the axial vector resonance , for which we adopt the description in @xcite .",
    "moreover , perturbation theory for the resonance wave - function allows us to evaluate also the corrections to the two - pion - one - vector couplings .",
    "we want to stress that our results represent a novelty , since no expressions for the corrections to the vector decay constants and to the two - pion - one - vector couplings have appeared in the literature even in papers explicitly devoted to this effect in the @xmath8 hw model .",
    "this was one of the motivations of our work and constitutes the core of our original analytic work .    in holographic models ,",
    "the fact that all vector resonance wave functions are kaluza - klein excitations of a 5d gauge field has the consequence that they satisfy completeness relations from which sum rules can be obtained .",
    "we address the issue of the saturation of these sum rules by the first few resonances both in the unperturbed and in the perturbed metric case .",
    "this relevant discussion is possible only after our novel calculation of the corrections to the vector decay constants and to the two - pion - one - vector couplings .    in sec .",
    "5 we present numerical analyses and conclusions : we evaluate the effects of the gluon condensate on low energy parameters of qcd , in particular the gasser - leutwyler coefficients , the pion decay constant and @xmath21meson parameters . our discussion leads to a remarkable analogy between the @xmath8 hw model and the chiral quark model .",
    "we consider a 5d holographic hard - wall models with the extra - dimension @xmath22 restricted to a finite interval @xmath23 and unperturbed metric written as a conformal factor times the 5d flat metric as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the conformal factor @xmath28 is left unspecified ; in the case of @xmath8 it would be @xmath29 . we consider @xmath30 as the uv - brane , where the bulk fields have to coincide with the external sources of the 4d theory and @xmath31 as the ir - brane where suitable boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "as we shall mainly consider vector gauge fields , we impose neumann - type boundary conditions , which are common to all the hw models mentioned in the introduction , where , moreover , these b.c .",
    "force the absence of a massless resonance mode . in the case of sw models , where the fifth coordinate @xmath22 is no more restricted to a finite interval , the ir boundary condition",
    "would be replaced by a normalization condition .",
    "the quadratic part of the 5d action for the gauge fields is given by : @xmath32 with linearized field strength @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a 5d coupling constant , which in @xmath8 models is usually fixed to @xmath35 , where @xmath6 is the number of colors of the 4d dual gauge theory , by matching the two - point function at large euclidean momentum with the perturbative result of qcd parton loop .",
    "otherwise , @xmath34 could be fixed by the requirement of obtaining the physical value of the pion decay constant @xmath36 .",
    "its actual value is irrelevant for the general discussion of this and the next sections , so we shall momentarily suppress it . for the same reason , we have also suppressed any flavor index of the 5d fields .",
    "we shall restore the correct factors in sec .",
    "4.2 , when we discuss the 5d ads slice , which is the playground of the hw models @xcite .",
    "we shall need them in order to make some numerical analysis of the effects of condensates and compare with the existing literature .",
    "it is convenient to work in @xmath37 gauge .",
    "then , the 5d gauge fields @xmath38 holographically correspond to conserved vector currents @xmath39 of the dual 4d theory , and the holographic formula will allow the calculation of the correlation function of two currents , in two steps .",
    "first , one solves the 5d equations of motion of the gauge field , requiring the solution to coincide on the uv boundary with the 4d source @xmath40 of the vector current .",
    "this is done by means of the bulk - to - boundary propagator .",
    "secondly , the 5d action is evaluated on this solution and identified with the generating functional of the 4d theory according to eq.([holography ] ) . finally , by varying twice with respect to the boundary sources , one obtains the holographic result for @xmath41 .",
    "using fourier - transformed gauge fields , written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fourier transforms of @xmath38 and the source @xmath40 respectively , one gets : @xmath45 the bulk - to - boundary propagator , @xmath46 , satisfies the linearized 5d equations of motion with 4d momentum , @xmath47 : @xmath48 and the boundary conditions @xmath49 varying ( [ s2q ] ) with respect to the boundary sources gives the scalar part of the two - point function : @xmath50 which is in general defined by @xmath51 let the functions @xmath52 form the orthogonal basis of normalizable eigenfunctions satisfying @xmath53 and the boundary conditions : @xmath54 they are normalized according to the scalar product @xmath55 in order to get from the 5d action a canonically normalized 4d kinetic term for the kaluza - klein modes @xmath56 .",
    "they also satisfy the completeness relation @xmath57 the two - point function @xmath58 admits a bound - state expansion given by @xmath59 with @xmath60    eq .",
    "( [ boundstates ] ) shows the pole structure of the two - point function , corresponding to an infinite sum over resonances which correspond vector mesons with increasing masses @xmath61 and decay constants @xmath62 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the green function @xmath63 , which is the solution of the equation @xmath64 with the boundary conditions @xmath65 then @xmath63 can be expanded as @xmath66 and the bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath46 and the two - point function @xmath58 can be respectively written as : @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "let us now suppose the conformal factor in the metric ( [ metric ] ) to be written as @xmath69 with @xmath70 , that can treated perturbatively , and @xmath71 , so as not to alter the behavior of the metric on the uv boundary @xmath30 . then , writing the bulk - to - boundary as @xmath72 , one has that the unperturbed @xmath73 obviously satisfies ( [ eom ] ) with @xmath28 replaced by @xmath74 and the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) , while the first order correction @xmath75 is a solution of @xmath76 where the differential operator @xmath77 is @xmath78 and satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath79 let @xmath80 and @xmath81 be two independent solutions of the differential equation for @xmath73 , then , imposing the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) it is easy to get @xmath82 where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath22 . as we shall see in the next section , in the case of flat 5d slice @xmath73",
    "is expressed in terms of trigonometric functions , while in the case of @xmath8 slice , @xmath83 and one gets for @xmath73 the well known ratio of combinations of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "standard methods , _",
    "e.g. _ the use of the green function , lead to the following expression for @xmath75 @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the wronskian of the two functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "previous formulae have been written with an uv cut - off @xmath89 to comply with uv divergences which my appear in explicit examples , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath8 , due to the divergent behavior of the conformal factor @xmath74 as @xmath90 .    from the expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath75 one obtains the first order corrected two point function @xmath91 where we have assumed that @xmath92 for @xmath90 to get rid of an additional term .",
    "explicit use of the green function method to get the first order correction to the two - point function due to metric perturbation in the @xmath8 case was made in @xcite , where it is also mentioned that the method had been used by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the expressions in @xcite are readily obtained from ( [ v1 ] ) with @xmath80 and @xmath81 being , in that case , bessel functions .",
    "we shall deal with the @xmath8 hw model in sec .",
    "although ( [ sigmacorr ] ) gives the solution to the problem of finding the first order correction to the two - point function , due to metric perturbations , it rests on the choice of two solutions @xmath80 and @xmath81 of eq.([eom ] ) .",
    "it would be more satisfying if the first order correction could be written in term of the unperturbed bulk - to - boundary propagator ( [ v0 ] ) and of the perturbation operator @xmath77 ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is the case . using the expression ( [ v0 ] ) for @xmath73 and further manipulating the expression ( [ sigmacorr ] )",
    ", the first order correction to the two - point function can be written in the following two equivalent forms obtained one from the other by integration by parts : @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the scalar product ( [ scalarproduct ] ) with respect to the unperturbed metric .",
    "both expressions in ( [ compact ] ) have interesting interpretations .",
    "the first shows the first order correction to the two - point function as the matrix element \" of the perturbation operator ( [ d1 ] ) on the unperturbed bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath73 , with the scalar product defined by the unperturbed metric .",
    "the second expression in ( [ compact ] ) shows that it is given by the 5d action on - shell , but with the perturbed conformal factor of the metric @xmath95 .",
    "the last result suggests the existence of a simpler derivation .",
    "in fact , as we shall see in a moment , it is a direct consequence of the ads / cft recipe ( [ holography ] ) of identifying the 4d effective action with the 5d action evaluated on - shell .    in momentum space , the @xmath22-dependent part of the 5d bulk action on - shell is given by @xmath96= -\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{z_0}w(z ) \\left(\\left ( \\cv'(p , z)\\right)^2-p^2\\cv(p , z)^2\\right)dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the bulk - to - boundary propagator of 5d vectors in the metric background with warp factor @xmath28 . if we write @xmath97 and look for a perturbative solution of the form @xmath72 we have at first order : @xmath98=s_{m_5}^{(0)}[\\cv_0]+<\\left[{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\delta s_{m_5}^{(0)}}{\\displaystyle \\delta \\cv}}\\right]_{\\cv_0 } , \\cv_1(p , z)>_0\\label{sexpa}\\\\ & -\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{z_0}w_0(z)h(z ) \\left(\\left ( \\cv'_0(p , z)\\right)^2-p^2\\cv_0(p , z)^2\\right)dz,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on - shell , the first term becomes a boundary term , i.e. the 0-th order term in ( [ sigmacorr ] ) , while the second term , proportional to the unperturbed equation of motion , vanishes and we are left with just the last one , which is precisely what we got in ( [ compact ] ) .",
    "as we have already mentioned , one can use ( [ compact ] ) , for instance , to evaluate sub - leading corrections to the asymptotic expansion of @xmath99 for large euclidean momentum @xmath100 .",
    "more interestingly , one can use it in order to extract corrections to the parameters , masses and decay constants , appearing in the bound - state decomposition of the two - point function , by studying the structure of pole singularities of the two - point function .",
    "in fact , the correction alters both the position of the poles and the corresponding residues .",
    "there are , however , some little subtleties in this procedure which we shall illustrate in sec.4 .      the two - point function can be written as the bound - state decomposition ( [ boundstates ] ) , where masses and decay constants are related to the mass eigenvalues and to the values , weighted by the metric conformal factor , of the derivatives of the wave functions @xmath52 at the origin . in presence of a deformation of the metric , wave functions are modified too .",
    "first order corrections can be evaluated using perturbation theory for eigenfunction .",
    "the derivation is straightforward , but leads to final formulae slightly different from those familiar from quantum mechanics .",
    "the reason is that the deformation of the metric does not only affect the wave - function equations , but also the scalar product entering in the normalization condition ( [ scalarproduct ] ) .",
    "this leads to a new diagonal term in the first order correction of @xmath52 , which is normally absent in perturbation theory .",
    "if @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed case @xmath103 , then the first order corrections @xmath104 and @xmath105 are given by the following expressions @xmath106 where @xmath77 is defined in ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ correeigen ] ) is the one due to the fact that the deformation of the metric affects also the scalar product . in explicit examples , it is numerically relevant .    from ( [ correlambda ] ) and ( [ correeigen ] ) one gets the the corrections to masses and coupling constants : @xmath107",
    "it may seem not evident that the corrections to masses and decay constants obtained here generate , through the bound - state decomposition ( [ boundstates ] ) , the same correction to the two - point ( [ compact ] ) deduced in the previous section , but this is the case , as explicitly shown in the appendix .",
    "the case of gauge vector field in a flat extra - dimension slice @xmath108 , _ i.e. _ with warp factor @xmath109 , has a nice interpretation as the continuum limit of deconstruction models @xcite .",
    "its simplicity allows for analytic calculations of the first order perturbative corrections to masses and coupling constants due to a metric perturbation .",
    "we report here the corresponding formulae . moreover , eq.([compact ] ) can be used to extract the sub - leading terms in the expansion of the two - point function for large euclidean momenta @xmath110 which is also an important effect of the metric deformation establishing an holographic link between metric deformations of the 5d theory and non - vanishing condensates of the 4d dual theory .",
    "in fact , in the 4d gauge gauge theory , sub - leading terms of the two - point function in the deep euclidean kinematical region are produced by non - perturbative effects of condensates @xcite .",
    "turning to the case of flat 5d extra - dimension on a finite interval , the normalized wave - functions are @xmath111 with eigenvalues @xmath112 the bulk - to - boundary propagator is the solution of ( [ eom ] ) , with @xmath113 and satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) : @xmath114 using ( [ sigma0 ] ) , the two - point function can be written @xmath115 the bulk - to - boundary can also be expanded in series of eigenfunctions as follows @xmath116 then , the two point function admits the bound - states decomposition @xmath117 and one can read the values of the unperturbed masses of the vector resonances from the poles and their coupling constants from the corresponding residues at the pole : @xmath118 we now use the results of secs . 3 , to evaluate the the correction to the two - point function and the effects on resonance masses and decay constants , due to a deformation of the flat metric of the form @xmath119 as we shall see in the in the next section , this choice of the deformation is suggested by the fact that , in the ads / cft correspondence , it would reproduce the effects of a 4d operator of conformal dimension four such as the gluon condensate .",
    "we obviously assume in our perturbative approach the dimensionless constant @xmath120 to be small , and consider only corrections of first order in @xmath120 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 .    inserting @xmath121 above into the expression ( [ compact ] ) , the resulting integrals can be easily evaluated and one gets for the first order correction of the two - point function @xmath122 it is convenient to use the identity @xmath123 , valid to first order in @xmath120 , and rewrite 1st order corrected two - point function in the form @xmath124 perturbed masses and decay constants can be extracted from ( [ sigma0and1flat ] ) by looking for the zeroes of the denominator , _",
    "i.e. _ the positions of the poles , and then extracting the corresponding residues .    explicitly , once that the two - point function has been put in the form of a ratio of two functions @xmath125 as above , residues are evaluated by expanding , around the poles , _",

    "it is not difficult to check that the corrections to the masses coincide with those obtained from perturbation formula ( [ correlambda ] ) for the eigenvalues .",
    "we have also checked that the corrections to the decay constants coincides numerically with the ones obtained using perturbation formulae ( [ correeigen ] ) and taking first derivatives of the perturbed eigenfunctions evaluated at @xmath30 as in ( [ pertdecay ] ) .",

    "there , the ads / cft dictionary , relating 5d fields and 4d operators is supposed to hold and it gives a good understanding of what 4d effect one is actually evaluating . referring to the original papers for the details , we limit ourself to repeat the same sort of calculations we did in the previous section for the 5d flat space , and concentrate again on the effects of a perturbation of the form ( [ pertz4 ] ) , whose link to 4d condensates can be given a much solid ground in the ads case @xcite .",

    "let us now discuss the inclusion of the gluon condensate . as we explained before , we shall focus on the prediction of the model for observables which involve the complete spectrum of resonance as is the case for the gasser - leutwyler coefficients and the pion decay constant . in the second column of table 2 ,",
    "we report the values obtained by the fit of the @xmath19 and @xmath168 , using the expressions ( [ fpipert]-[l10pert ] ) , with an estimated theoretical error on @xmath168 of @xmath171 .",
    "the values of @xmath120 and @xmath138 which minimize the @xmath172 are @xmath173 and @xmath174 mev@xmath175 ( not far from the value @xmath176 mev@xmath175 which would be obtained by fitting @xmath169 without condensate ) , with @xmath172/d.o.f.=3.2/4 .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath120 and @xmath138 have been used to compute the values of @xmath169 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the @xmath179 region for @xmath180 is light shaded in the first contour plot of fig.3 .",
    "the third column of table 2 shows the values obtained by adding also the values of the physical parameters of the lowest vector resonance , the @xmath161 , with an estimated theoretical error of @xmath181 .",
    "the values of @xmath120 and @xmath138 which minimize the @xmath172 are @xmath182 and @xmath174 mev@xmath175 , with @xmath172/d.o.f.=8.0/ 7 .",
    "the @xmath179 region for @xmath180 is light shaded in the second contour plot of fig.3 .",
    "the determination of the best-@xmath172 values is sharpened at the cost of having an higher @xmath172 per d.o.f .",
    "using eq.([frometatoo4 ] ) one can derive from @xmath182 and @xmath174 mev@xmath175 a prediction for the condensate @xmath183 which is compatible with the average experimental value @xmath184 reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we believe that this simple analysis already shows that gluon condensate corrections evaluated through metric deformation in hw models leads to results qualitatively in agreement to what we expect from qcd .",
    "we notice also that the trends of the numerical values of the gasser - leutwyler coefficients , that we have found , in the presence of gluon condensate , and also those of vector and axial vector masses and decay constants agree with those evaluated in the enjl model in @xcite .",
    "now we want to observe another hint towards the connection between the chiral quark model @xcite and the ads hard - wall model .",
    "as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , it just happens in the chiral quark model that , with neglect of the gluonic couplings , for some of the @xmath185 terms in the qcd effective action ( @xmath186 ) one gets finite results in the uv and ir domains , _",
    "i.e. _ cut - off independent values ; of course this does not hold once the gluonic corrections are turned on .",
    "the same is happening for the same @xmath19 s in the ads hw model : no dependence on @xmath138 . here",
    "we want to stress that this gives further support to the ads picture vs the flat metric where the same @xmath19 s show an explicit dependence on the ir cut - off , @xmath138 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the holographic description of the effects of a gluon condensate in terms of a suitable deformation of the metric of a 5d hard wall model .",
    "we have not considered the effects of the @xmath187 condensate since our focus was on low energy qcd physics , once @xmath188sb has been already triggered by some mechanism .",
    "since the estimated value for the gluon condensate is phenomenologically acceptable , our treatment seems appropriate .",
    "moreover , the quark condensate should not be considered in the comparison with the chiral quark model .    comparing with previous literature ,",
    "we have computed for the first time the corrections to the resonance decay constants , @xmath189 and vector - to two - pion couplings , @xmath190 and we have shown the validity of the sum rules even in presence of gluon condensate : this has been the core of our calculation .",
    "we have also discussed the case of flat metric .",
    "we have found substantial evidence toward an analogy of the ads hw holographic model and the chiral quark model .",
    "we have also performed a novel numerical analysis , which leads to a satisfactory value for the gluon condensate , showing that the model is able to capture the relevant physics properties .",
    "we thank fabio ambrosino , domenico cuozzo and guglielmo de nardo for discussions and help . this work has been supported in part by the european commission ( ec ) rtn flavianet under contract no .",
    "mrtn - ct-2006 - 035482 and by the italian ministry of education and research ( miur ) , project 2005 - 023102 .",
    "in this appendix we give a proof of the equivalence of the two perturbative methods developed in sec.3 .",
    "we neglect the issue of the convergence of the bound - state expansion ( [ boundstates ] ) .",
    "let us first show the useful identity @xmath191 the lhs of the previous expression can be written @xmath192 then , @xmath193 where we used the completeness relation ( [ completeness ] ) for the unperturbed eigenfunctions , and the last equality is a consequence of the boundary condition ( [ bceigen ] ) and of the vanishing of @xmath194 at the origin .",
    "using the identity ( [ identity ] ) one can show , for instance , that the two expressions which are obtained inserting the bound - state expansion for @xmath46 in the two different ways of expressing the first order correction to the two - point function in ( [ compact ] ) , actually coincide and give @xmath195    this expression has to be identical to the one which we obtain inserting in the bound - state expansion ( [ boundstates ] ) the perturbative corrections ( [ correlambda ] ) and ( [ correeigen ] ) to masses and eigenfunctions , _ i_.e .",
    "@xmath196 using ( [ correlambda ] ) and ( [ correeigen ] ) , one has @xmath197 and then @xmath198 the next step is to notice that , as @xmath199 it is convenient to express the matrix elements @xmath200 as the sum of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts , which we denote by @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively . with a little effort , one can show that @xmath203 then , the first order correction to @xmath58 in ( [ lastsigma ] ) splits into four terms as follows : @xmath204 using the identity ( [ identity ] ) , it can be shown that the sum of the second and the fourth term in ( [ big ] ) is zero . using the symmetry of @xmath205 and the identity ( [ identity2 ] ) , the third term in ( [ big ] )",
