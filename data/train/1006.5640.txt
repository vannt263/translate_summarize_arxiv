    "the understanding of hadronic systems in terms of their elementary degrees of freedom have been , and still is , one of the most challenging problems in particle and nuclear physics over the last ten years .",
    "the phenomenological properties of hadrons are now rather well understood in terms of models , like the constituent quark model or the bag model .",
    "the understanding of their properties from the original lagrangian of qcd is however still under active debate .    in nuclear physics",
    ", the properties of nuclear structure in terms of the exchanges of pions are also well known .",
    "they are described by using a phenomenological nucleon - nucleon potential expressed in terms of the exchanges of one pion , two correlated pions and so on . however , their complete description from an effective chiral lagrangian is still missing .",
    "a common difficulty in both domains is the description of relativistic bound systems .",
    "this description should be nonperturbative from the start in order to be able to find , for instance , the physical mass of the bound state from the pole of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the problem is especially acute when the interaction coupling constant is large .",
    "one of the most relevant approaches aimed at studying relativistic systems of interacting particles is light - front dynamics ( lfd ) proposed initially by dirac  @xcite .",
    "lfd is a form of hamiltonian dynamics which deals with the state vector defined not at a fixed time moment , but on the light front plane @xmath0 , in its traditional form .",
    "the state vector is then usually decomposed in a series of fock sectors , each containing a fixed number of particles .",
    "the use of lfd to investigate relativistic bound states has been advocated for a long time . however , while the dynamics of few - body systems , based on a phenomenologically constructed interaction , has developed rapidly , application of lfd to field theory beyond a perturbative framework is not yet under complete theoretical control .",
    "this is due to the fact that any practical calculation relies on taking into account only a restricted number of fock sectors in the state vector decomposition or , in other words , on the fock space truncation .",
    "this approximation strongly complicates the renormalization procedure , in contrast to that in standard perturbation theory .",
    "indeed , the full cancellation of field - theoretical divergences which appear in a given fock sector requires taking into account contributions from other sectors .",
    "if even a part of the latter is beyond our approximation , some divergences may leave uncancelled .",
    "mathematically , it reflects itself in possible dependence of approximately calculated observables on the regularization parameters ( e.  g. , cutoffs ) .",
    "this prevents to make any physical predictions if we can not control the renormalization procedure in one way or another .    in a previous study  @xcite",
    "( see also references therein ) we have developed an appropriate renormalization procedure ",
    "the so - called fock sector dependent renormalization ( fsdr ) scheme  in order to keep the cancellation of field - theoretical divergences under permanent control .",
    "our approach is based on the covariant formulation of lfd ( clfd ) , where the state vector is defined on an arbitrary light - front plane characterized by a light - like four - vector @xmath1  @xcite and given by the equation @xmath2{$\\cdot$}}x = 0 $ ] .",
    "the covariant formulation is necessary in order to control any violation of rotational invariance , including that which is caused by the fock space truncation . in particular , this is important in order to formulate , in an unambiguous way , the renormalization conditions one should impose on the bare coupling constant ( bcc ) to relate it to the physical one .    in ref .  @xcite we calculated the fermion state vector and the electromagnetic form factors within the yukawa model and qed in the lowest nontrivial approximation , when the state vector includes only two fock sectors given by one constituent fermion and one constituent fermion coupled to one boson .",
    "for this two - body fock space truncation , the electromagnetic form factors are identical to those obtained in the second order of perturbation theory , giving rise to a schwinger - type correction to the fermion magnetic moment .",
    "note that this result is not surprising , in spite of the fact we have not done any expansion in powers of the coupling constant , since no other contributions to the fermion electromagnetic vertex , apart from the perturbative ones ( resummed to all orders ) is generated in the two - body truncation .",
    "we shall present in this work the calculation of the fermion anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) within the same yukawa model , but for the three - body fock space truncation , when the state vector includes an additional fock sector containing one constituent fermion coupled to two scalar bosons .",
    "the presence of three - body states gives rise to nontrivial nonperturbative contributions to the amm , which can not be fully incorporated in perturbation theory .",
    "besides that , the yukawa model is a quite nontrivial one from the point of view of the renormalization procedure , since it exhibits simultaneously mass , vertex , and wave function renormalization .",
    "the plan of the article is the following .",
    "we recall in sec .",
    "[ bound ] the main features of our nonperturbative approach and the renormalization procedure .",
    "the eigenvalue equations are derived in the three - body truncation in sec .",
    "[ three - body ] .",
    "we calculate the fermion electromagnetic form factors in sec .  [ elm ] and present our numerical results for the amm in sec .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the appendices collect all necessary details to calculate the amm .",
    "the state vector @xmath3 describing any relativistic system with total four - momentum @xmath4 forms a representation of the poincar group .",
    "the four - momentum operator squared @xmath5 is one of the casimir operators of this group and the state vector satisfies the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the physical system under consideration and @xmath8 .",
    "lfd serves as an effective and convenient tool to solve this eigenvalue equation .",
    "indeed , one of the main advantages of lfd is that , due to kinematical constraints , the vacuum state of a system of interacting particles coincides with the free vacuum , and all intermediate states result from fluctuations of the physical system .",
    "one can thus construct the state vector in terms of combinations of free fields , i.e. decompose it in a series of fock sectors : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the state containing @xmath11 free particles with the four - momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 s are relativistic @xmath11-body wave functions , the so - called fock components .",

    "the mc @xmath46 is determined from the eigenvalue equation  ( [ gamma ] ) by demanding that the bound state mass @xmath7 is equal , for the ground state , to the physical mass @xmath44 of the constituent fermion .",
    "for this reason , we will distinguish @xmath7 and @xmath44 only when it is necessary .",
    "otherwise , we will set @xmath49 .",
    "besides mc s , the interaction hamiltonian includes also the bcc @xmath50 .",
    "the latter is determined , as in perturbation theory , by relating the on - energy - shell two - body vertex function @xmath51 to the physical coupling constant @xmath52 . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ k1n ] ) , taking @xmath51 on the energy shell is equivalent to setting @xmath53 . once @xmath7 is identified with @xmath44 , the latter condition reduces to @xmath54 [ see eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) ] .",
    "below , for brevity , we will denote the on - energy - shell two - body vertex function as @xmath55 to indicate that its arguments are connected by the corresponding kinematical constraint .",
    "being a solution of the system of eigenvalue equations  ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath51 depends on the bcc @xmath50 .",
    "hence , relating @xmath51 to @xmath52 is equivalent to relating @xmath50 to @xmath52 , which just means coupling constant renormalization .",
    "this can be most easily done starting from the three point function with all undressed on - mass - shell external lines , called @xmath56 .",
    "it is connected with the physical coupling constant by the following standard relation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath57 where the @xmath58-factors are the so - called field strength renormalization constants for the fermion ( @xmath59 ) ( both in the initial and final state ) and boson ( @xmath60 ) lines , respectively .",
    "this condition can also be recovered by demanding that the residue of the fermion - boson elastic scattering amplitude at @xmath61 equals @xmath62 .",
    "one can thus deduce the expression for @xmath63 in terms of the full fermion self - energy @xmath64 : @xmath65 ^{-1}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath66 as a function of the full boson self - energy .",
    "the two - body fock component @xmath51 being a solution of the eigenvalue equation  ( [ gamma ] ) does not coincide with @xmath67 . by definition",
    ", @xmath56 has no radiative corrections to any of its three legs , while @xmath51 , on the contrary , includes such corrections .",
    "the relation between these two vertex functions taken off the energy shell is rather complicated in lfd .",
    "fortunately , we need to know it on the energy shell only , where it simplifies strongly , because the on - shell radiative corrections mentioned above reduce to @xmath68-number factors . indeed , @xmath51 is a particular case of the general vertex function shown in fig .",
    "[ gamman ] , corresponding to @xmath69 , i.  e. two of its legs are represented by single external lines ( one for the constituent fermion and one for the constituent boson ) , while the third leg , for the physical fermion , is shown by a double line .",
    "radiative corrections to each of the two external single lines are given by insertions of self - energy parts with their subsequent summation .",
    "the latter , of course , can be done directly within lfd by using the graph techniques rules , but we will choose a simpler way .",
    "each on - energy - shell amplitude calculated in lfd must coincide with that found in the standard four - dimensional feynman approach and taken on the mass shell .",
    "hence , @xmath55 coincides with its on - mass - shell feynman counterpart .",
    "the summation of radiative corrections to external lines in the feynman approach is technically easier than in lfd , since it can be done for each of the two lines independently .",
    "we allow the external particle momenta being off the mass shell ( in order to avoid intermediate singularities ) , then sum up the radiative corrections and finally perform a limiting transition to the mass shell .",
    "thus , summing a chain series of self - energy blocks - together with the mass - counterterm insertion - on the constituent fermionic line with the four - momentum @xmath70 brings the factor    @xmath71 & = & \\lim_{{k \\!\\!\\ ! /}_1\\to",

    "this factor is nothing else than @xmath63 given by eq .",
    "( [ zf ] ) .",
    "analogous procedure for the boson line leads to the factor @xmath66 .",
    "the total factor which appears due to the dressing of the two constituent lines is therefore @xmath73 .",
    "concerning the double fermionic line in @xmath51 , its renormalization factor is related to the normalization condition for the state vector .",
    "the eigenvalue equation  ( [ gamma ] ) transforms into a homogeneous system of linear integral equations for the vertex functions .",
    "hence , the solution is determined up to an arbitrary common factor . in practice , for solving this system of equations , it is convenient to fix the ( constant ) one - body fock component @xmath74 , so that the other components ( @xmath51 , @xmath75 , etc . ) become proportional to it .",
    "then the double line in @xmath51 brings the factor @xmath74 which , in its turn , is determined by the normalization condition  ( [ normep ] ) for the state vector . since @xmath76 is just the norm of the one - body fock sector , @xmath74 is equal to @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the first term in the sum  ( [ inor ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath79 becomes therefore on the energy shell @xmath80 excluding @xmath81 from eqs .",
    "( [ renor ] ) and  ( [ g2on ] ) , we find that the renormalization condition reads @xmath82 where @xmath51 is expressed from the eigenvalue equation  ( [ gamma ] ) , through the bcc @xmath50 .",
    "a similar discussion of the renormalization condition in terms of the one - body component @xmath74 was already done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when we neglect the boson dressing by fermion - antifermion fluctuations , as we do in this work , the condition  ( [ gam3a ] ) finally reduces to @xmath83 note that there is a simple relation between the one - body normalization factor @xmath78 and the field strength renormalization factor @xmath63 : @xmath84 as shown in appendix  [ renorma ] .      the above conditions imposed on the bcc and mc are necessary in order to express physical observables , like the electromagnetic form factors , through the measurable coupling constant and masses .",
    "as a consequence , one should expect full cancellation of divergences .",
    "such a program could be realized in perturbation theory or nonperturbatively if the fock space is not truncated .",
    "the latter case is hardly achieved in practice .",
    "usually , fock space is truncated to a finite order @xmath41 of admitted fock sectors , and the cancellation of divergences is not anymore guaranteed . for instance , looking at fig .",
    "[ self ] for the calculation of the fermion propagator in the second order of perturbation theory , one immediately realizes that the cancellation of divergences between the self - energy contribution ( of order two in the fock decomposition ) and the fermion mc ( of order one ) involves two different fock sectors  @xcite .    ]",
    "this means that , as a necessary condition for the cancellation of divergences , any mc and , more generally , any bcc should be associated with the number of particles present ( or `` in flight '' ) in a given fock sector . in other words ,",
    "all mc s and bcc s must depend on the fock sector under consideration .",
    "the original mc , @xmath46 , and the fermion - boson bcc , @xmath50 , should thus be extended each to a whole series :    [ fsdr ] @xmath85    with @xmath86 .",
    "the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are calculated by solving the systems of equations for the vertex functions in the @xmath89 , @xmath43 , @xmath90 , ... approximations successively .",
    "this fsdr scheme has been proposed initially in ref .",
    "@xcite and developed as a full renormalization scheme in ref .",
    ". an alternative approach , also in the pauli - villars ( pv ) regulated yukawa model with the two - boson truncation , but with a sector - independent renormalization scheme , was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the series  ( [ fsdr ] ) does not imply that we have an infinite number of counterterms or bare parameters .",
    "we still have the original ones @xmath50 and @xmath46 in the hamiltonian we start with , but they have different values according to the level of approximation used in the calculation . in the limit of an infinite @xmath41 , and if the fock sector expansion converges , @xmath91 and @xmath92 should turn to the true bcc and the mc , respectively .",
    "this is completely analogous to the case of perturbation theory where , at each order @xmath11 , one determines @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "apart from the mass and vertex radiative corrections , the third type of divergences arises from the field renormalization , i.  e. from the constants @xmath63 and @xmath66 .",
    "the values of these constants should also depend on the maximal number @xmath41 of particles kept in a given truncation .",
    "consider for instance the vertex function @xmath51 represented by fig .",
    "[ gamman ] for @xmath69 .",
    "the dressing of the physical fermion leg ( the factor @xmath77 ) should be calculated for the truncation to the @xmath41-th order .",
    "the situation changes however for the constituent ( single ) fermion line .",
    "the state in which the constituent fermion is considered already contains one constituent boson .",
    "hence , even if the boson line is not dressed , the dressing of the constituent fermion leg involves radiative corrections of order @xmath95 . in other words , the dressing factor @xmath63 for the constituent fermion leg must be calculated for the lower , @xmath95-body truncation .",
    "otherwise , we would go beyond our approximation , since the effective number of particles in which the physical fermion can fluctuate would exceed @xmath41 .",
    "taking this into account , the relations  ( [ renor ] ) and  ( [ g2on ] ) for a finite order truncation @xmath41 ( and in the absence of boson dressing ) obtain the following form :    @xmath96    the superscripts @xmath97 and @xmath95 here and below just indicate the order of the fock space truncation in which the corresponding quantities are calculated .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ renort ] ) and  ( [ iz ] ) that the renormalization condition  ( [ renorn1 ] ) simply writes @xmath98 in the absence of boson dressing .    for the simplest case of the two - body truncation , @xmath43 , one thus gets @xmath99 since @xmath100 .",
    "we recover here the condition given in ref .",
