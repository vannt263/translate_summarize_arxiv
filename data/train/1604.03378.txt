    "quantum gases offer a valuable platform for the study of quantum phenomena in interacting many - body systems . the availability of high - quality and reliable experimental control techniques and the low - level of external influences makes such systems excellent candidates for the simulation of quantum processes  @xcite and the exploration of the interplay between these and quantum critical behaviours .",
    "recent experimental progress has shown the possibility to observe non - equilibrium physics  @xcite , which is quickly leading to the establishment of an experimental ultracold - atom framework for the exploration of complex phenomena , such as many - body localisation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this framework can be used to test the recently developed ideas for the finite - time thermodynamics of closed quantum systems  @xcite , which include tools for the quantification of thermodynamically relevant quantities , such as work and entropy , after a finite - time , non - equilibrium quantum quench . to date , this powerful formalism of non - equilibrium quantum thermodynamics has found only limited experimental validation and has been mostly applied to nuclear magnetic resonance settings  @xcite . however , notwithstanding the exquisite control available over such systems , they are hard to scale and offer only few possibilities for the inclusion of many - body effects . on the contrary ,",
    "ultracold atomic gases offer solutions for both of these issues and we will therefore in the following study the connections between the phenomenology of non - equilibrium quantum gases and finite - time thermodynamics .    for this , we consider small - size gases of interacting bosonic atoms that are perturbed out of their equilibrium configuration . in particular , we focus on the ground state of interacting , harmonically trapped bosonic atoms in one dimension , and subject them to a sudden quench of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "such a perturbation , which has been recently explored to characterise the occurrence of anderson s orthogonality catastrophe  @xcite , embodies the paradigm of a non - equilibrium process and has been shown to capture perfectly the complexity arising from quantum many - body effects in quantum spin systems  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the case of a fermionic system was addressed and developed , the study of the statistics of work in bosonic josephson junctions was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the study of quenched attractive cold gases has recently been examined in ref .",

    "@xcite proposed realizing many - particle thermal machines using harmonically trapped bosons where a quantum advantage can be achieved .    here",
    "we explore the non - equilibrium properties of these trapped ultracold atoms .",
    "first , we find the analytical expressions for relevant thermodynamical quantities , such as the loschmidt echo ( le ) and the average work , for a single atom subjected to a quench in the trapping frequency and elucidate the relation between the entropy production and the tendency toward dynamical orthogonality , although we find that the evolved state is never completely orthogonal to the initial one for finite quenches in the trapping frequency . enlarging the system , we study the role particle interactions play . for the infinitely repulsive tonks - girardeu molecule",
    "we find analytical expressions for the same figures of merit as in the single atom case .",
    "while the qualitative behaviour is consistent with the single atom case , we now see due to the strong interactions , finite sized quenches lead to dynamical orthogonality . for finite interactions ,",
    "we find numerically that the average in time of the entanglement and the ( irreversible ) average work are linked .",
    "this is a crucial result in this paper , as we find that even in the smallest interacting system , there exists a link between the establishment of correlations ( entanglement ) and the work done .",
    "we relate these features to the spectral function , which gives the fundamental excitations that dictate the dynamics .",
    "we complete our work studying the smallest possible mixture of ultracold bosons with both inter- and intra - species interactions : two atoms of type x and one atom of type y and employ the same figures of merit as in the previous cases .",
    "we show a relationship between the le and the density profile , which is an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "furthermore this gives information about the correlations established among the atoms and indicates a trend for larger gases subjected to a quench , a situation of great theoretical interest and experimental relevance  @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark here that , using symmetry arguments , we show that the mixture of three atoms behaves identically to that of the three indistinguishable - boson system if both the inter- and intra - species constants are equal .",
    "our presentation is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ quantities ] we provide a brief introduction to non - equilibrium quantum thermodynamics , focussing in particular on the consequences arising from a sudden quench .",
    "this formal framework is then applied in sections [ one]-[three ] to the single atom , trapped molecule and three atom mixture when subjected to the quench of their hamiltonian parameters .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] draws our conclusions , while a set of technical considerations and details are presented in the appendices .",
    "in the following we will first briefly summarise the key notions of finite - time thermodynamics in closed quantum systems . for this we consider a system whose hamiltonian , @xmath0 , depends on an externally controlled , time - dependent _ work parameter _ @xmath1 .",
    "the system is assumed to be in contact with a bath at inverse temperature @xmath2 for a time long enough to have reached equilibrium . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the system is detached from the reservoir and its energy is changed by modifying the value of the work parameter from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution is accounted for by the unitary propagator @xmath6 . as the system is detached from the surrounding world ,",
    "such a change of energy can only be interpreted as work done on / by the system , which can be characterised by introducing the work probability distribution  @xcite @xmath7 .",

    "obviously , such a joint probability can be decomposed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the probability that the system is found in state @xmath12 at time @xmath3 and @xmath18 is the conditional probability to find the system in @xmath13 at time @xmath15 if it was initially in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 contains information about the statistics of the initial state and the fluctuations arising from quantum dynamics and measurement statistics .",

    "the former can be written as @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the change in energy and @xmath26 the corresponding entropy variation .",
    "on the other hand , if the process is fast ( i.e. not quasistatic ) , then the relation @xmath27 holds , accounting for the fact that part of the work performed on / by the system is _ dissipated _ due to the abrupt nature of the transformation . by introducing the standard definition of non - equilibrium entropy production @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average heat exchanged with the environment , we find for a closed , unitarily evolving system @xmath30 this allows to quantify the irreversible nature of a given process in terms of the discrepancy between @xmath23 and @xmath31 .",
    "the definition of @xmath32 allows for the consideration of the so - called irreversible work @xmath33 which will be extensively used in this work . a general approach to irreversible entropy in open quantum systems ( including non - equilibrium ones ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a different quantifier which is based on the use of adiabatic transformations ( rather than the implicit isothermal ones considered here ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a very useful lower bound to the non - equilibrium entropy production , @xmath32 , can be based on the unitarily invariant bures angle ( see ref .",

    "@xmath34 , the bures angle is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 the fidelity between the two states . using this",

    "( [ bound ] ) defines a thermodynamic distance that is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium , and can thus be used to characterise the departure from equilibrium following an arbitrary driving process .",
    "since we are interested in examining the dynamics of a cold atomic system after a sudden quench , we will make use of the fact that we start from the ground state of a given system and that its state remains pure throughout the whole dynamics .",
    "we will use the spectral decomposition of the initial and final hamiltonians of the system @xmath41 with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) denoting the initial ( final ) hamiltonian operator . here",
    "@xmath44 is the @xmath45 eigenvalue of @xmath46 with associated eigenstate @xmath47 .",
    "a key figure of merit for our system is the loschmidt echo ( le ) , which is defined as @xmath48 where we have assumed that the initial state of the system @xmath49 coincides with the ground state @xmath50 of @xmath51 .",

    "the interactions are of contact form and characterised by the intra- and inter - species coupling constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in this situation , the hamiltonian reads @xmath128 + g_\\mathrm{x } \\delta ( x_1-x_2)+ g_\\mathrm{xy }   \\sum^2_{j=1}\\delta ( x_j{-}y),\\ ] ] where the dimensionless coordinates are defined by rescaling energies and coupling rates as above . note that the eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) have to be symmetric with respect to the exchange of the x bosons , but no symmetry restriction for the interchange of the x atoms with the y atom exists . a detailed study of the forms and properties of the eigenstates @xmath129 of eq .  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , focusing on the degeneracies of the spectrum , is given in the supplementary material .    the rdm for the single atoms can be calculated by taking the partial trace of the state of the three - atom system over two of the atoms and",
    "is given for one of the x atoms by @xmath130 analogously , for the impurity atom of species y , we have @xmath131 here the functions @xmath132 are the natural orbitals that diagonalise the rdms with natural orbital occupations @xmath133 .",
    "the vne of the impurity or of one of the atoms of species x can then be calculated as @xmath134        as mentioned previously , for any finite interaction strength , a quench in the trapping frequency results in an effective change of the interaction strength . while for the trapped molecule a quench of either parameter led to the same behaviour , the presence of two coupling constants in the current system complicates the matter . in order to clearly identify the role atomic interactions play in the dynamics ,",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves in the following to quenching the interaction strengths directly .",
    "it is worth noting that , when @xmath135 or @xmath136 is large enough to effectively reach the tg limit . ] , the behavior of the three - atom system is qualitatively the same as the single and two atom cases , respectively .    for our two - component system",
    "there are in principle five different strategies for quenching the coupling constants @xmath137 , but in the following we will focus on just two strategies as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figq ] , as these encompass the most relevant features of the thermodynamic properties of the system ( see appendix a for a discussions of the other strategies )    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig6app ] shows the evolution of the density profile for a quench of @xmath138 taken from @xmath139 to a value that is either much smaller than @xmath140 , or comparable to it .",
    "the phenomenology is strikingly different for both cases . for @xmath141 the density profile for the x atoms",
    "is peaked at center of the trap , while the impurity y has a double - peak structure which is localised at the sides of the density of x. this distribution shows only a weak temporal change and the separation is maintained , which corresponds to the flat vne of the individual species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3app ] * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * ) .",
    "the case in which the final value of @xmath142 is comparable to the inter - species coupling rate shows more pronounced temporal oscillations , which are also seen in the behaviour of the vne .",
    "the atomic species are strongly correlated regardless of the strength of the quench",
    ". however , large quenching amplitudes result in dips of the vne at the refocusing time of the density profile that are much less pronounced than those occurring at small final values of @xmath143 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the evolution of the density , the vne , and occupation of the natural orbitals shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig2bis ] with that of a system of three indistinguishable atoms .",
    "the energy spectrum for such a system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath144 ) , and clear differences from that of two atoms plus a third distinguishable one are visible . in the latter case",
    "triple degenerate states occur in the limit @xmath145 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] quench * a * ) and a discrete group theory analysis presented in refs .",
    "@xcite showed that these three degenerate states belong to different irreducible representations of the group .",
    "the discrete group to which these solutions belong is the discrete rotational group of order 2 , @xmath146 , restricted by the bosonic symmetry under interchange of the two indistinguishable atoms .",
    "indeed , for all finite values of the coupling constants , all wave functions can be classified according to the possible irreducible representations of this group . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the ground state for the three indistinguishable atoms was the same as the 2 + 1 case for all values of @xmath147 .",
    "this is not too surprising , as these solutions obey all symmetries under interchange of two atoms required by the three - indistinguishable atoms which coincide with the ones required by the corresponding irreducible representation of the group in the 2 + 1 system .    by comparing the dynamical evolution of the density , the vne , and the occupations of the natural orbitals for a system of three - indistinguishable atoms with the 2 + 1 setting",
    ", we find that they all coincide .",
    "the reason for this is that the initial state is a non - interacting gaussian state with certain symmetries , which corresponds to the absence of a change in the sign of the wave function when any pair of atoms interchanges their coordinates .",
    "therefore it belongs to a definite irreducible representation of the @xmath146 , restricted by the bosonic symmetry under the interchange of the two x atoms  @xcite .",
    "if the system has this symmetry initially , the dynamical evolution has to conserve it , so only part of the energy spectra in the 2 + 1 case plays a role in the evolution .",
    "this part of the energy spectra is exactly the same as in the case of three indistinguishable atoms .",
