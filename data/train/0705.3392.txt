    "to solve the fine - tuning problem of the standard model ( sm ) , the little higgs theory @xcite was proposed as a kind of electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism accomplished by a naturally light higgs sector .",
    "the higgs boson remains light , being protected by the approximate global symmetry and free from one - loop quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff scale .",
    "the littlest higgs model @xcite provides an economical approach which implements the idea of the little higgs theory .",
    "most of the constraints from the electroweak precision tests on little higgs models @xcite come from the tree - level mixing of heavy and light mass eigenstates , which would require raising the mass of the new particles to be much higher than tev scale and thus reintroduce the fine - tuning in the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "however , these tree - level contributions can be avoided by introducing a discrete symmetry called t - parity @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the top quark has a t - even partner ( denoted as @xmath0 ) and a t - odd partner ( denoted as @xmath1 ) .",
    "in addition , some extra t - odd fermions need to be also introduced in order to make the model t - parity invariant .",
    "these predicted new t - even and t - odd quarks will cause some effects in various processes , especially the top quark and higgs boson processes @xcite , at collider experiments . in this note",
    "we focus on the higgs - pair production process at the lhc , which may be sensitive to new physics",
    ".    the higgs - pair production process at the lhc will provide a way to probe the higgs boson self - coupling @xmath2 .",
    "with design luminosity , it is possible for the lhc to establish that the sm higgs boson has a non - zero self - coupling and that @xmath2/@xmath3 can be restricted to a range of 0 - 3.7 at @xmath4 confidence level if its mass is between 150 and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "such higgs - pair production process has been studied in various new physics models @xcite .",
    "recently , this process was studied in the littlest higgs model without t - parity @xcite and with t - parity @xcite . however , the study in @xcite only considered the contributions of t - even quarks but ignored the effects of the t - odd fermions .",
    "as shown in some recent analyses @xcite , the t - odd fermions can also cause some interesting collider phenomenology and their effects can not be ignored .",
    "given the popularity of the littlest higgs model with t - parity and also the importance of the higgs - pair production at the lhc as a probe of higgs self - interaction , we in this note give a complete calculation for the higgs - pair production in the littlest higgs model with t - parity by considering the contributions of both t - even and t - odd quarks .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recapitulate the t - odd fermions and the top - quark sector of the littlest higgs model with t - parity . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the higgs - pair production at the lhc .",
    "finally , we give our conclusion in sec .",
    "the original littlest higgs model @xcite is based on a non - linear sigma model describing the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath5 down to a global @xmath6 at an energy scale @xmath7 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of an @xmath5 symmetric tensor @xmath8 is proportional to _ 0 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & + 0 & 1 & 0 + & 0 & 0 +    ) , where @xmath9 represents a unit @xmath10 matrix .",
    "the low energy dynamics of non - linear sigma is described in terms of the field ( x ) = e^i /f _ 0 e^i ^t / f = e^2i /f _ 0 with ( x)=_a=1 ^ 14 ^a(x ) x^a , where @xmath11 are the goldstone particles corresponding to 14 broken generators @xmath12 for the @xmath13 breaking .    to implement t - parity in the fermion sector",
    ", it requires the introduction of the mirror fermions . for each sm lepton / quark doublet , under the @xmath14 gauge symmetry , two fermion doublets @xmath15 and @xmath16 are introduced .",
    "they can be embedded into incomplete representations @xmath5 multiplets @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a right - handed @xmath6 multiplets @xmath19 transforming nonlinearly under the full @xmath5 is introduced to give mass to the extra fermions .",
    "the field content can be expressed as @xmath20 with @xmath21 the first component of @xmath22 is irrelevant to our study ( as shown later ) and the second component of @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "the mirror fermions can be given @xmath24 masses via a mass term @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the generation indices .",

    "the mirror fermion @xmath40 is t - odd , and @xmath41 is t - even and massless .",
    "the same definitions also apply to the down - type mirror quarks .",
    "the fermions @xmath42 and @xmath43 can obtain large dirac masses by introducing additional fermions , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we also assume the dirac mass terms @xmath44 . from eq.([kappa_int ] ) we can see that the first component of the doublet @xmath22 does not appear and the t - odd down - type quarks have no tree - level couplings with the higgs boson .",
    "after diagonalizing the mass matrix , we get the mass eigenstates @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which couple with @xmath38 and @xmath48 , respectively .      in order to cancel the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass induced by top quark",

    "note that under t - parity these fields transform as @xmath61 therefore , the t - parity eigenstates are defined as @xmath62 ( t - odd ) , @xmath63 ( t - even ) , and the same definitions also apply to the right - handed singlets . from the above lagrangian",

    "( [ top - yukawa ] ) , we can get the mass eigenstates @xmath73 and @xmath0 as well as their couplings with the higgs boson .",
    "now we look at the higgs pair production in the littlest higgs model with t - parity at the lhc . the production can proceed through gluon - gluon fusion and @xmath74 annihilation at parton level , with the former being the dominant one @xcite .",
    "the feynman diagrams of higgs - pair production via gluon - gluon fusion are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the sm",
    "the dominant contributions are from the diagrams of fig.1(a , c , d ) with top - quark loops . in the littlest higgs model with t - parity ,",
    "the top - quark loops give additional contributions through the tree - level @xmath75 coupling and the modified @xmath76 coupling .",
    "in addition to the top - quark loops , the loops of new t - even and t - odd quarks also come into play .",
    "so all these particles should be summed over in our loop calculations .",
    "( as we pointed earlier , the calculations in @xcite did not include the contributions of t - odd quarks ) .",
    "the calculations of the loop diagrams in fig .",
    "1 are straightforward .",
    "each loop diagram is composed of some scalar loop functions @xcite which are calculated by using looptools @xcite .",
    "the calculations are tedious and the analytical expressions are lengthy , which are not presented here .",
    "we numerically checked our results by comparing our @xmath77 parton cross section with ref .",
    "the calculations in @xcite considered the loop effects of ( i ) the top - quark and t - even t - quark , ( ii ) the heavy neutral triplet higgs boson @xmath78 , and ( iii ) the first and second generation quarks .",
    "since the dominant contributions are from ( i ) @xcite , their results should be in approximate agreement with ours if we only keep the contributions of the top - quark and t - even t - quark with the same input parameters .",
    "we made such a comparison in table 1 .",
    "we see that our results agreement quite well with @xcite .",
    ".the comparison between our results with @xcite for the contributions of the top - quark and t - even t - quark to @xmath77 cross section by using the same parameters and the same feynman rules . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that in the littlest higgs model with t - parity , t - parity forbids the generation of a vev for the triplet scalar field and also forbids the contributions of the new t - odd particles to processes with external sm fermions at tree - level .",
    "therefore , the electroweak precision constraints on the model with t - parity are generically quite weak and , as a result , the symmetry breaking scale @xmath79 may be as low as 500 gev @xcite . when expanding in the power series of @xmath80 , we need to keep some higher orders since @xmath80 may be not so small ( for example , @xmath81 for f=500 gev ) . therefore , when expanding the @xmath82 and @xmath83 to diagonalize the mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ top - yukawa ] ) , we keep the order up to @xmath84 .",
    "the diagonalization of the mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ top - yukawa ] ) was performed numerically in our analyses ( in @xcite the approximate expressions are given ) .",
    "the hadronic cross section at the lhc is obtained by convoluting the parton cross section with the parton distribution functions . in our calculations",
    "we use cteq6l @xcite to generate the parton distributions with the renormalization scale @xmath85 and the factorization scale @xmath86 chosen to be @xmath87 and the two - loop running coupling constant @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "the sm parameters involved are taken as @xmath90 gev @xcite and @xmath91 gev @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath92 gev in our numerical calculations .",
    "the new free parameters involved are the symmetry breaking scale @xmath79 , the ratio @xmath93 , @xmath29 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "our calculations show that the results are not sensitive to @xmath29 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 tev , which is in agreement with the finding in @xcite .",
    "thus , we take @xmath97 , @xmath98 tev and retain @xmath79 and @xmath99 as free parameters .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot the hadronic higgs - pair production cross section at the lhc versus the parameter @xmath79 for several values of @xmath99 . here , we included all effects from the top - quark , t - even and t - odd quarks ( three generations ) .",
    "2 shows that the contributions of this model increase the sm cross section in the allowed parameter space , and the magnitude of such corrections depends on the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath79 .",
    "the corrections are sensitive to the scale @xmath79 and become more sizable for lower values of @xmath79 .",
    "for example , for @xmath100 , the total cross section can reach @xmath101 fb . in fig .",
    "2 we also show a typical prediction by supersymmetric model from the first reference of @xcite . note that in the minimal supersymmetric model the higgs boson mass @xmath102 is upper bounded by 135 gev and can not be as heavy as 150 gev which we choose for both the sm and the littlest higgs model .",
    "we see that the production rate in the littlest higgs model with t - parity can be larger than the supersymmetric model prediction in the allowed parameter space .",
    "the comparison of the results with and without t - odd quark contributions is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the contributions of t - odd quarks are equally important and thus can not be neglected .",
    "for example , with ( without ) the contributions of t - odd quarks , the cross section is 29 fb ( 21 fb ) .",
    "in the framework of the littlest higgs model with t - parity we calculate the production of a pair of neutral cp - even higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "we found that , due to the loop contributions of both t - even and t - odd quarks predicted in this model , the production rate can be significantly enhanced relative to the standard model prediction .",
    "also , we found that the t - odd quark contributions , which were ignored in previous studies , are equally important compared with the t - even quark contributions and thus can not be negelected .",
