    "although the imf has been derived from vastly different regions , from the solar vicinity to dense clusters of newly formed stars , the basic features seem to be strikingly universal to all determinations @xcite .",
    "initial conditions in star forming regions can vary considerably . if the imf depends on the initial conditions , there would thus be no reason for it to be universal .",
    "therefore a derivation of the characteristic stellar mass that is based on fundamental atomic and molecular physics would be more consistent .",
    "there are many ways to approach the formation of stars and star clusters from a theoretical point of view .",
    "in particular models that connect stellar birth to the turbulent motions ubiquiteously observed in galactic molecular clouds have become increasingly popular in recent years .",
    "see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the interplay between turbulent motion and self - gravity of the cloud leads to a process we call gravoturbulent fragmentation : supersonic turbulence generates strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most massive regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "once gas clumps become gravitationally unstable , collapse sets in .",
    "the central density increases and soon individual or whole clusters of protostellar objects form and grow in mass via accretion from their infalling envelopes .",
    "however , most current results are based on models that do not treat thermal physics in detail . typically , a simple isothermal equation of state ( eos ) is used .",
    "the true nature of the eos , thus , remains a major theoretical problem in understanding the fragmentation properties of molecular clouds .",
    "recently @xcite conducted a systematic study of the effects of a varying polytropic exponent  @xmath0 on gravoturbulent fragmentation .",
    "their results showed that @xmath0 determines how strongly self - gravitating gas fragments .",
    "they found that the degree of fragmentation decreases with increasing polytropic exponent @xmath0 in the range @xmath6 although the total amount of mass in collapsed cores appears to remain roughly consistent through this range .",
    "these findings suggest that the imf might be quite sensitive to the thermal physics .",
    "however in their computations , @xmath0 was left strictly constant in each case . here",
    "we study the effects of using a piecewise polytropic equation of state and investigate if a change in @xmath0 determines the characteristic mass of the gas clump spectrum and thus , possibly , the turn - over mass of the imf .",
    "observational evidence predicts that dense prestellar cloud cores show rough balance between gravity and thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "thus , the thermodynamical properties of the gas play an important role in determining how dense star - forming regions in molecular clouds collapse and fragment .",
    "observational and theoretical studies of the thermal properties of collapsing clouds both indicate that at densities below @xmath7 , roughly corresponding to a number density of @xmath8 , the temperature decreases with increasing density .",
    "this is due to the strong dependence of molecular cooling rates on density @xcite .",
    "therefore , the polytropic exponent @xmath0 is below unity in this density regime . at densities above @xmath7",
    ", the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust grains , which then control the temperature by far - infrared thermal emission .",
    "the balance between compressional heating and thermal cooling by dust causes the temperature to increase again slowly with increasing density .",
    "thus the temperature - density relation can be approximated with @xmath0 above unity in this regime ( larson this volume ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . changing @xmath0 from a value below unity to a value above unity results in a minimum temperature at the critical density .",
    "as shown by @xcite , gas fragments efficiently for @xmath9 and less efficiently for higher @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the jeans mass at the critical density defines a characteristic mass for fragmentation , which may be related to the peak of the imf .",
    "to gain insight into how molecular cloud fragmentation the characteristic stellar mass may depend on the critical density we perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations of the gravitational fragmentation of supersonically turbulent molecular clouds using the parallel code gadget designed by @xcite .",
    "sph is a lagrangian method , where the fluid is represented by an ensemble of particles , and flow quantities are obtained by averaging over an appropriate subset of sph particles , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method is able to resolve large density contrasts as particles are free to move , and so naturally the particle concentration increases in high - density regions .",
    "we use the @xcite criterion the resolution limit of our calculations .",
    "it is adequate for the problem considered here , where we follow the evolution of highly nonlinear density fluctuations created by supersonic turbulence .",
    "we replace the central high - density regions of collapsing gas cores by sink particles @xcite .",
    "these particles have the ability to accrete gas from their surroundings while keeping track of mass and momentum .",
    "this enables us to follow the dynamical evolution of the system over many local free - fall timescales .",
    "we compute models where the polytropic exponent changes from @xmath10 to @xmath11 for critical densities in the range @xmath12 .",
    "each simulation starts with a uniform density distribution , and turbulence is driven on large scales , with wave numbers @xmath13 in the range @xmath14 .",
    "we use the same driving field in all four models .",
    "the global free - fall timescale is @xmath15 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the effects of varying the critical density , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] the resulting mass spectra at different times when the fraction of of mass accumulated in protostellar objects has reached approximately 10% and 30% .",
    "this range of efficiencies corresponds roughly to the one expected for regions of clustered star formation @xcite . in the top - row model ,",
    "the change in @xmath0 occurs below the initial mean density .",
    "it shows a flat distribution with only few , but massive cores .",
    "these reach masses up to @xmath16 and the minimum mass is about @xmath17 .",
    "the mass spectrum becomes more peaked for higher @xmath18 and shifts to lower masses .",
    "we find closest correspondence with the observed imf @xcite for a critical density @xmath1 of @xmath19 and for stages of accretion around @xmath20 . for high masses ,",
    "the distribution exhibits a @xcite power - law behavior . for masses about the median mass",
    "the distribution has a small plateau and then falls off towards smaller masses .",
    "the change of median mass @xmath21 with critical density  @xmath18 is quantified in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - med - rho ] . as @xmath18 increases @xmath21 decreases .",
    "we fit our data with straight lines .",
    "the slopes take values between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "using sph simulations we investigate the influence of a piecewise polytropic eos on the gravoturbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "we study the case where the polytropic index @xmath0 changes from 0.7 to 1.1 at a critical density @xmath18 , and consider the range @xmath12 .    a simple scaling argument based on the jeans mass @xmath24 at the critical density @xmath25 leads to @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a close relation between the average jeans mass and the gravoturbulent fragmentation spectrum , a similar relation should hold for the characteristic mass @xmath27 of protostellar cores .",
    "our simulations qualitatively support this hypothesis , however , with the weaker density dependency @xmath28 .",
    "so indeed , the density at which @xmath0 changes from below unity to above unity defines a preferred mass scale .",
    "consequently , the peak of the resulting mass spectrum decreases with increasing critical density .",
    "the distribution not only shows a pronounced maximum but also a power - law tail towards higher masses , similar to the observed imf .",
    "altogether , supersonic turbulence in self - gravitating molecular gas generates a complex network of interacting filaments .",
    "the overall density distribution is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "turbulent compression sweeps up gas in some parts of the cloud , but other regions become rarefied .",
    "the fragmentation behavior of the cloud and its ability to form stars depend on the eos",
    ". however , once collapse sets in , the final mass of a fragment depends not only on the local jeans criterion , but also on additional processes .",
    "for example , protostars grow in mass by accretion from their surrounding material . in turbulent clouds the properties of the gas reservoir are continuously changing . and",
    "in addition protostars may interact with each other , leading to ejection or mass exchange .",
    "these dynamical factors modify the resulting mass spectrum , and may explain why the characteristic stellar mass depends on the eos more weakly than expected from simple jeans - mass scaling arguments .",
    "our investigation supports the idea that the distribution of stellar masses depends , at least in part , on the thermodynamic state of the star - forming gas .",
    "if there is a low - density regime in molecular clouds where the temperature @xmath29 sinks with increasing density @xmath30 , followed by a higher - density phase where @xmath29 increases with @xmath30 , fragmentation seems likely to be favored at the transition density where the temperature reaches a minimum .",
    "this defines a characteristic mass scale .",
    "the thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a result of the balance between heating and cooling processes , which in turn are determined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances .",
    "the theoretical derivation of a characteristic stellar mass may thus be based on quantities and constants that depend mostly on the chemical abundances in the star - lpwh klforming cloud ."
