    "in addition to having larger residuals , the single - sersic fit ( 1 ) does not well match the observed color profile , ( 2 ) the @xmath69 are @xmath1825% larger than that of the double - srsic profiles , and ( 3 ) over - predicts the amount of light even with the overlying starburst component at the center of the galaxy .",
    "therefore we prefer the double - sersic fit and use this fit throughout the paper .",
    "we note that while @xcite do not provide the effective radius of their fits , both our single and double - sersic fits are better fits to the data than the de vaucouleurs profile fit they show in their fig . 3 of @xcite .",
    "specifically , their fit is poor at radii less than 14@xmath25 .",
    "to estimate the effect of our choice of inner and outer boundaries on the fit , we varied the inner boundary from 2@xmath25 to 10@xmath25 and outer boundary from 70@xmath25 to 110@xmath25 for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-images ; this resulted in a variation of the inner srsic index and effective radius of 1% and the outer fitted srsic sb profile less than 5% .",

    "the transformed profiles agree from the center to 90@xmath25 to within 10% , beyond this distance , a somewhat larger systemic discrepancy of @xmath1820% exists between the @xmath0- and @xmath29-band .",
    "this discrepancy does not affect our profile fits which are performed only out to 100@xmath25 .",

    "one possible interpretation of this is that henize  2 - 10 was a typical early - type galaxy before some event formed the nuclear component .",

    "we find that for a bh of mass @xmath227 we would expect an increase in dispersion of @xmath228  km @xmath34 ; this is smaller the 1@xmath49 random errors on our measurement and thus a bh of this mass can not be ruled out .",
    "we can place a firm upper limit of @xmath15 on the bh which would increase the dispersion by @xmath187  km @xmath34 and thus be clearly detectable at the 3@xmath49 level in our data .",
    "another possibility is that the bh is significantly obscured and the stars we are seeing are in the foreground of the bh .",
    "if this were the case , the obscuring material would need to be on scales larger than the sphere of influence .",
    "we also searched for coronal line emission in the vicinity of the bh and did not find a convincing detection .",
    "this line has an ionization energy of 285 ev , thus requiring x - ray emission likely only generated by an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the only other coronal line in our bandpass is the line which falls on top of the co bandhead region and thus is challenging to detect at weak flux levels .",

    "[ brgamma ] shows the br@xmath17 emission map within our nifs fov .",
    "this map shows a clear enhancement of br@xmath17 emission at the agn s position ( red cross is the bh s suggested location with an astrometric uncertainty of @xmath180@xmath461 ) . to examine this br@xmath17 peak in more detail",
    ", we create a nuclear spectrum around this source with a radius of @xmath231 and sky annulus is about 10% of the total br@xmath17 flux .",
    "this spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ agn ] ; the main panel shows the spectrum , while the small upper right panel shows a zoom - in of the dominant emission line , br@xmath17 .",
    "no broad br@xmath17 emission is seen .",
    "the total br@xmath17 luminosity is @xmath232 @xmath34 .",
    "we can compare this luminosity to the x - ray luminosity to evaluate whether the agn could be the source of the observed br@xmath17 line or not .",
    "the best fit power law model for the source gives an x - ray luminosity is @xmath233 @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this best fit also gives @xmath234 which corresponds to @xmath235 .",
    "we can convert the x - ray luminosity to an expected br@xmath17 luminosity ; derives an empirical linear relationship of x - ray to @xmath236 luminosity for a sample of 47 agns and 30 qsos : @xmath237 ; it appears that this error bar is misprinted ; we recalculated the error on the relation by examining the scatter in the data and found a zeropoint error of 0.85 , therefore we assume a relation @xmath238 .",
    "we also note that this relation may not hold at low accretion rates or at low masses ( e.g. , for henize  2 - 10 ) . proceeding with this caveat",
    ", the predicted @xmath239 luminosity ranges from @xmath240 @xmath34 to @xmath241 @xmath34 .",
    "next , assuming case b recombination and a temperature of @xmath242 k , the ratio of br@xmath17/h@xmath243 is 0.01 @xcite .",
    "thus the predicted br@xmath17 luminosity is between @xmath244 @xmath34 and @xmath245 @xmath34 .",
    "the error in this determination is dominated by the error on the conversion between @xmath246 and @xmath239 ; the conversion from h@xmath247 to br@xmath17 is similar over the full range of reasonable temperatures ( i.e. ,  5,00020,000  k ) .",
    "we now estimate whether this predicted br@xmath17 luminosity is consistent with the observed luminosity given the extinction values from the x - ray data and observed from line - emission ratios by . with the observed and the predicted br@xmath17 luminosity above , the ratio @xmath248",
    "; therefore , assuming the @xcite extinction law , the extinction suggested is @xmath249 or corresponding to a hydrogen column of @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "the extinction maps of show values between @xmath251 ; nearest the location of the agn , the average extinction is approximately @xmath252",
    ". the hydrogen column also overlaps with the poorly constrained hydrogen column fit from the x - ray spectrum by @xcite of @xmath234 .",
    "thus it is plausible that the br@xmath17 emission we observe is coming from accretion onto the bh .",
    "if the br@xmath17 emission is indeed from the bh , it allows us to measure the velocity of the bh relative to the galaxy as a whole . fitting the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ agn ] ( with r = @xmath231 ) , the br@xmath17 radial velocity is ( @xmath253  km  @xmath34 redshifted relative to systemic velocity of the galaxy and its velocity dispersion is ( @xmath254 )  km  @xmath34 taking into account the local instrumental dispersion .",
    "we assume the systemic velocity of the galaxy is @xmath18872@xmath536  km  @xmath34 .",
    "we have examined the overall morphology and nuclear regions of henize  2 - 10 using ground - based photometric data , adaptive optics gemini / nifs data and _ hst _ data .",
    "our primary findings are :    1 .",
    "henize  2 - 10 is well fit by a two component srsic profile .",
    "the inner srsic profile has @xmath63 and @xmath255 ( @xmath256 pc ) , and the outer srsic profile has @xmath65 and @xmath257 ( @xmath18  1kpc ) . the absolute magnitude of henize 2 - 10 within 4.3 kpc is @xmath258 , @xmath259 in @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band .",
    "2 .   the total stellar mass of henize  2 - 10 within 4.3 kpc is @xmath260 as derived from the @xmath1-band , a factor of @xmath261 times higher than previous estimates based on the @xmath14-band luminosity .",
    "3 .   apart from the inner starburst , henize  2 - 10 appears to be typical early - type galaxy .",
    "its outer color @xmath262 is consistent with an old population .",
    "furthermore , it is non - rotating and dispersion - dominated near the center and has an outer srsic index consistent with other early - type galaxies of similar luminosity .",
    "we estimate the dynamical mass of the brightest ssc in henize  2 - 10 to be @xmath263  m@xmath10 , higher than previous estimates .",
    "we use this mass estimate to derive new masses for 11 clusters at the center of henize  2 - 10 , assuming a constant @xmath109 for all the clusters .",
    "the timescale for dynamical friction is @xmath264 years for the sscs at the center of henize  2 - 10 .",
    "an nsc of mass @xmath265  m@xmath10 should be formed within a few hundred myr ; this cluster mass would be typical for galaxies of henize  2 - 10 s mass .",
    "thus , we are seeing nsc formation in progress in this galaxy , and this formation appears to be independent of the formation of the bh in this system .",
    "6 .   while there are few examples of @xmath266 star - forming galaxies with observational evidence for a massive bh ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the occupation fraction of massive bhs in early - type galaxies of this mass is likely @xmath1890% @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that henize 2 - 10 hosts a massive bh .",
    "our observations allow us to place a firm upper limit on the bh mass of @xmath267 .",
