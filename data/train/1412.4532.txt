    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) have been widely observed in the local universe , with inferred isotropic luminosities above 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath4 ( roberts 2007 ; feng & soria 2011 ) .",
    "those below @xmath03@xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath4 can be readily associated with accretion onto stellar mass black holes ( @xmath010 m@xmath5 ) accreting close to or at their eddington limit ( see sutton , roberts & middleton 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "there is now strong evidence to support this assertion , with the discovery of extremely bright ballistic jets from a ulx in m31 ( middleton et al .",
    "2013 ; middleton , miller - jones & fender 2014 ) , which unambiguously links the flow with eddington rate accretion ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) , and the first dynamical mass measurement of the compact object in a ulx , from m101 ulx-1 ( liu et al . 2013 ) .",
    "observations of such ` low luminosity ' ulxs ( soria et al . 2012 ; middleton et al . 2011a , 2012 ; kaur et al .",
    "2012 ) have revealed changes in the disc emission that may imply the creation of a radiation pressure supported , larger scale - height flow in the inner regions ( middleton et al .",
    "2012 ) or magnetic pressure support ( straub , done & middleton 2013 ) . although emission below @xmath0 2  kev is generally heavily photo - electrically absorbed by material in the galactic plane ( e.g. zimmerman et al .",
    "2001 ) , similar spectral behaviour may also be seen in a small number of galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) at high rates of accretion ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2009 ; uttley & klein - wolt in prep . ) .",
    "such ` extreme ' high state bhbs probably dominate the ulx population ( walton et al .",
    "2011 ) yet a significant number of ulxs can still be found at higher luminosities .",
    "those above 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 are dubbed hyperluminous x - ray sources ( hlxs : gao et al .",
    "2003 ) and provide the best evidence ( farrell et al . 2009 ; webb et al .",
    "2012 , servillat et al . 2011 ; davis et al .",
    "2011 ) for a population of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs : colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) . such imbhs ( with masses above those expected from direct stellar collapse : @xmath7100s of m@xmath5 ) could potentially be formed in globular clusters ( miller & hamilton 2002 , but see maccarone et al .",
    "2007 ) , through capturing and tidally stripping a dwarf galaxy ( king & dehnen 2005 ) or mergers in young super star clusters ( portegies - zwart et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "ulxs that fall between the two categories , i.e. @xmath8 = @xmath03@xmath110@xmath2 to 1@xmath110@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 ) remain contentious and have been proposed as possible locations for imbhs accreting at low sub - eddington rates ( e.g. miller , fabian & miller 2004 ; strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ) .",
    "indeed , the brightest objects in this class , with @xmath9 , have demonstrated observational properties consistent with imbhs in the hard state ( sutton et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , for the less luminous ulxs , several problems exist with this interpretation for the _ entire _ population ( see king 2004 for a discussion of theoretical issues related to formation ) ; namely the emission characteristics do not generally match the expectation for low rates of accretion where , in the case of a bh of mass 10@xmath10 m@xmath5 , the emission from the disc would still peak in the soft x - ray band and so the structure of the flow is not expected to deviate strongly from that in bhbs at similar rates ( see zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . as a result",
    ", we would expect such sources to display a hard spectrum up to @xmath7 50 kev due to thermal comptonisation in an electron plasma arranged in some still - undetermined geometry . instead ,",
    "ulxs up to 2@xmath110@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 generally show spectra that can not easily be reconciled with sub - eddington accretion ( stobbart et al .",

    "; walton et al . 2013 ; 2014 ) which , in at least one source , has been unambiguously associated with eddington - rate accretion ( motch et al . 2014 ) .    obtaining a deeper and full understanding of the nature of these sources , requires consideration of both spectral and variability properties _ simultaneously _ , with the latter providing a complementary set of powerful diagnostics by which to make comparisons to better understood sources .",
    "this has proven to be valuable , e.g. whilst the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the lightcurves of 5 ulxs ( to date ) have been used as evidence in support of imbhs ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2009 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "2007 ; strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ; rao , feng & kaaret 2010 ) , the details of the variability do not generally appear to well - match this identification ( middleton et al . 2011 ; pasham & strohmayer 2012 but see also pasham , strohmayer & mushotsky 2014 ) .",
    "notably , the recent study of sutton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) has reinforced the idea of using variability properties ( the fractional variability : edelson et al .",
    "2002 ) together with spectra to broadly characterise the properties of ulxs .",
    "this has demonstrated an apparent dependence of variability on spectral shape , distinctly unlike that expected from imbh accretion . instead",
    "it has been argued that both the spectral ( gladstone et al .",
    "2009 , feng & kaaret 2009 ) and variability properties ( heil , vaughan & roberts 2009 ) of these contentious ulxs can be fully explained by a model for ` super - critical ' accretion onto stellar mass bhs ( or equally neutron stars : king 2009 ; bachetti et al .",
    "2014 ) , where inclination and mass accretion rate are likely to be the key determining factors in appearance ( middleton et al .",

    "optically thick equatorial wind is predicted ( and reproduced in mhd simulations - ohsuga 2007 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ) to be radiatively driven from the disc from within the ` spherization radius ' , @xmath11 which can be at large radii ( depending on the mass transfer rate from the secondary : shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; king 2004 ; poutanen et al . 2007 - p07 hereafter ) . unlike models for sub - eddington accretion onto imbhs",
    ", this model can reproduce the observed spectrum with the soft emission being associated with the wind ( king & pounds 2003 ; p07 ) and the hard emission originating in the innermost regions which have been stripped of material , revealing the hot disc underneath ( potentially further distorted by turbulence , advection , spin and self - heating : beloborodov 1998 ; suleimanov et al . 2002 ; kawaguchi 2003 ) . as the wind",
    "is expected to be optically thick ( @xmath12 1 : p07 , at least near to the disc plane ) , the scattering probability is large such that , depending on inclination angle , we may expect geometrical beaming to amplify the hard emission ( king 2009 ; p07 ) or scatter emission out of the line - of - sight .",
    "should the wind be inhomogeneous / clumpy ( takeuchi , ohsuga & mineshige 2013 ; 2014 ) this scattering can theoretically imprint variability by extrinsic means ( middleton et al .",
    "2011 ) and produce the large fractional rms seen in many sources ( heil et al . 2009 ; sutton et al . 2013 ) . however , an explanation for how this variability mechanism operates and depends on key system parameters , such as inclination and mass accretion rate , has been lacking .    in this paper",
    "we build on previous theory and recent spectral - timing analyses of ulxs ( notably sutton et al .",
    "2013 ) and present a simple model for the variability originating in a radially propagating , inhomogeneous wind .",
    "this allows us to make a series of key predictions for the evolution with mass accretion rate ( sections 2 & 3 ) which we compare to observations ( sections 4 , 5 & 6 ) .",
    "for the benefit of the reader we now summarise the key properties of the super - critical model for accretion , as discussed and developed by several key authors .",
    "models describing the super - critical inflow ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2004 ; 2009 ; p07 ; dotan & shaviv 2011 ) differ in their precise details but the overall picture is one where the high mass transfer rate ( @xmath13 - in dimensionless units of eddington accretion rate ) from a close binary system results in the eddington limit being reached at large radii . in the case where the mass transfer rate is much greater than the ` critical ' value of ( 9/4)@xmath1eddington ( p07 ) , an optically thick outflow ( with the escape velocity , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the black hole mass and @xmath16 is the radial distance ) can be launched from within @xmath11 @xmath17 @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the position of the inner edge in @xmath20 ) where the scale height of the disc ( proportional to @xmath13 : shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) exceeds unity .",
    "mass is then lost through this outflow with the mass accretion rate decaying approximately linearly down to @xmath19 , where the accretion rate is locally eddington ( in the limit of no advection : p07 ) .",
    "the geometry of the super - critical inflow can be broadly defined by three zones ( depending on the optical depth of the outflow ) , as fully described in p07 ( to which we direct the interested reader ) and illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "* in the innermost regions ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) , the wind is essentially transparent ( @xmath23 1 ) and so the emission will appear as a distorted ` hot disc ' , peaking at a characteristic temperature , @xmath24 ( modified by some colour temperature correction , spin and overheating , see beloborodov 1998 ; suleimanov et al .",
    "2002 ; kawaguchi 2003 ) .",
    "* at larger radii , the outflow - seen effectively as an extension to the large scale - height inflow - is expected to be optically thick for mass accretion rates above a few times eddington . as a result of advection in this optically thick material ( as the photon diffusion timescale is longer than the viscous timescale ) , the radial temperature profile ( as seen at the last scattering surface at @xmath25 = 1 ) is broadened from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( see abramowicz et al . 1988 ) , and the result is a smeared blackbody extending from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . as the material in the wind is outflowing and we have assumed this is an extension of the inflow , the viscously dissipated energy emerges at larger radii ( @xmath0 twice the radius at which it is generated : p07 ) .",
    "however , this does not affect the temperature profile ( and nor in principal does having the wind disconnected from the inflow due to stratification ) .",
    "* at radii greater than @xmath11 , the optical depth of the wind falls as 1/r ( p07 ) such that the underlying emission begins to emerge at approximately the radius at which it is generated , i.e. the emission is a quasi - thermal black - body with a peak temperature of @xmath30 , which we shall refer to hereafter as the ` outer photosphere ' ( and for high mass transfer rates will peak in the uv rather than x - ray band - equation 38 of p07 ) .",
    "the detailed physical properties of the wind require the global geometry and radiative transfer to be fully modelled .",
    "whilst beyond the scope of this work , we can already make some simple deductions . the large scale - height flow and wind will naturally subtend a large solid angle to the hottest inner regions ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , p07 ) and so a correspondingly large fraction of the high energy flux will illuminate the material .",
    "the latest 2d mhd simulations ( takeuchi et al . 2013 ; 2014 ) show that the optically thick wind will have inhomogeneities due to the rayleigh - taylor ( or other hydrodynamic instability ) with a size of order 10  @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . given typical particle densities expected for these clumps ( up to @xmath33 @xmath34 : middleton et al .",
    "2014 ) , the wind will have a highly photo - ionised skin ( log@xmath35 6 out to hundreds of @xmath36 for a 10 @xmath37 bh ) down to an optical depth of unity ( where most of the scatterings occur ) . as a result",
    ", we expect the surface material of the wind ( clumpy or otherwise ) in the inner regions to be approximated to an electron plasma with a large optical depth ( @xmath38 1 - see p07 ) such that large amounts of incoming flux from the inner regions will be scattered into the cone of the wind .",
    "this naturally results in geometrical beaming ( proportional to @xmath39 : king & puchnarewicz 2002 ; king 2009 ) where , from simple inspection of the assumed geometry ( a hemispherical wind of opening angle @xmath40 , see figure 1 ) , we expect a scattered fraction of @xmath41 ) . as an example , for a wind launching angle of 45@xmath42(ohsuga et al .",
    "2011 ) we would then expect a factor of @xmath02.4 more flux to be scattered to an observer viewing down the cone of the wind .    scattering will not only amplify the emission from the innermost regions when looking into the cone of the wind but also change the energy of the scattered photons : as the wind plasma temperature is less than that of the hot disc , i.e. @xmath43 , the highly energetic incident photons will lose energy to the plasma in the inflow via compton down - scattering ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) and to the outflowing wind via both recoil and bulk effects ( e.g. titarchuk & shrader 2005 ; laurent & titarchuk 2007 ) . at larger inclinations ( i.e. sight lines intercepting the wind ) , the effect of beaming diminishes and the number of scatterings towards the observer - and therefore energy loss - will increase ( as the optical depth to the observer will be larger ) , although this will be complicated by the density profile of the wind which will not be constant as radiation momentum transfer ( plus the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium ) will cause the initial clumps to expand and density drop as they move away from the launching point ( e.g. takeuchi et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "l      the toy model of middleton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ascribed the observed large amplitude , short timescale ( tens to thousands of seconds ) variability seen in ngc  5408  x-1 to obscuration by individual clumps , generated through radiative - hydrodynamic instabilities in the wind ( now reproduced in simulations : takeuchi et al . 2013 ; 2014 ) . in the specific case of ngc  5408  x-1 ,",
    "this requires our line - of - sight to the inner regions to intercept the wind ( see middleton et al .",
    "2014 ) . in general",
    ", however , we may expect the variability in ulxs to originate through _ two _ mechanisms and below we provide the framework for these .",
    "a natural source of variability derives from the physical timescales of the clumps ( how long they exist before expanding and become optically thin , how quickly they are launched and how large they are ) .",
    "we can make a crude determination of the shortest timescales available and the impact on the flux , by considering a single element launched at a radial distance @xmath16 which remains optically thick for the duration of the transit across the projection of the illuminating , central region . as the distance to the observer is very large ,",
    "the crossing distance and area of the inner region is simply : @xmath44 @xmath45    assuming a maximum velocity in the perpendicular direction to the line - of - sight equal to the escape velocity ( @xmath46 = @xmath47 ) , we find a crossing time , @xmath48 : @xmath49    where @xmath22 and @xmath16 are given in units of gravitational radii ( @xmath50).this crossing time is the fastest timescale we should expect from this process . as an example , if we take values of @xmath16 = 1000@xmath51 , @xmath52 20@xmath51 ( from equation 32 of p07 , this would be for a small fraction of energy lost to the wind ) , @xmath15 = 10 - 100  m@xmath5 , @xmath53 = 45@xmath42 we find the fastest timescales to be of the order of seconds or faster .",
    "this is of course assuming only a single clump which , whilst not an accurate representation , remains an illustrative limit .",
    "it is then useful to see that the maximum drop in flux ( _ f _ ) we could expect from a single , optically thick clump is simply the ratio of the covering areas : @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the radius of the clump ( @xmath05@xmath51 from simulations : takeuchi et al .",
    "for the same values as above we can see that @xmath01% covering fraction is quite reasonable assuming only a single clump ; in the limit of a greater number , this value will of course increase ( dependent on the timescales between clumps being launched ) .    in a more physical sense , n clumps will be launched at a given radius over a given time leading to a shot noise process and probability distribution . as the crossing time will more accurately depend on the velocity distribution ( we only assumed the escape velocity to indicate approximate timescales ) and details of the instabilities leading to their production ( takeuchi et al .",
    "2014 ) , we approximate the power imprinted by these events as a sum of zero - centred lorentzians , cutting off at the mean of the velocity distribution ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57^{2}}\\ ] ]    where the tilde indicates a fourier transform .",
    "we do not define a lower frequency cutoff but we expect this to occur at the lowest frequencies of the shot noise process ( which will be a function of the radiative hydrodynamic instabilities leading to clump formation : takeuchi et al .",
    "2014 ) . above this low frequency break",
    ", the sum of lorentzians will approximate to a power - law shape with : @xmath58 @xmath59    where we assume @xmath60 to be within the range of observed noise processes seen in accreting black hole systems ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . here",
    "we explicitly account for the tendency at small inclinations for such processes to cancel out , leading only to an increase in apparent flux to the observer ( an increase as the clumps will scatter radiation _ towards _ the observer rather than obscure ) . as such , where we assume n to be large , this mechanism will only imprint variability for ulxs at larger inclinations where the effective number of scattering elements seen is lower due to overlap .",
    "this is a key prediction of this model , implying that the largest amounts of variability on the timescales of the events ( which should be relatively fast when compared to viscous changes : see next section ) , should be seen for sources at higher inclinations .",
    "should @xmath13 increase , we should expect some change in the filling factor of the clumps .",
    "an increase may tend to lower the amount of imprinted variability , but as the size and launching of individual clumps ( on which the variability relies ) is a function of the radiative - hydrodynamic instabilities ( see takeuchi et al .",
    "2014 ) , an accurate understanding is beyond the scope of the work here .      the above description assumes a wind that is ` steady - state ' ( i.e. matter is being launched at a constant rate at a given radius ) . however , in sub - eddington inflows , the observed ( often considerable ) variability ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; belloni 2010 ; muoz - darias , motta & belloni 2011 ; heil , uttley & klein - wolt 2014a ; 2014b ) originates as a result of inwardly propagating variations in mass accretion rate / surface density through the viscous inflow ( lyubarskii 1997 ; ingram & done 2012 ) which leads to the universally observed rms - flux relation in all accreting sources ( arevalo & uttley 2006 ; uttley et al .",
    "2005 , heil & vaughan 2010 ; heil , vaughan & uttley 2012 ; scaringi et al .",
    "this can then lead to the observed pds shape common to bhbs formed from a series of convolved lorentzians , damped above the local viscous timescale ( ingram & done 2012 ) .",
    "if we assume that propagation of fluctuations still occurs in the larger scale height super - critical flow , then this underlying and inherent stochasticity will drive radial variations in the mass loss in the form of the clumpy wind ( see eqn 26 of p07 ; figure 2 ) .",
    "should the variability originate via obscuration / scattering by clumps in the launched material , the propagating fluctuations will imprint additional variability onto the emission by changing the radially dependent ` global ' amount of mass loss and scattering . additionally , should the inner disc not be geometrically thin then the variability propagated down should also emerge directly .",
    "such an origin would seem to argue against an imbh interpretation where such discs should be geometrically thin and intrinsically stable ( churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "a clear prediction of this second mechanism is that , as mass is lost in the wind , some fraction of the variability carried in the flow at a given radius is expended such that the next inward radius has less with which to convolve ( figure 2 , churazov , gilfanov & revnivtsev 2001 ; ingram & van der klis 2013 ) and the wind tends to radial homogeneity with decreasing radius .",
    "the effect of this mechanism then is to imprint the variability of the propagating flux ( via scatterings or directly from the inner disc ) , suppressed at frequencies higher than the local viscous timescale at @xmath11 ( where mass loss begins ) : @xmath61^{2 } } , r > r_{sph}\\ ] ] @xmath61^{2 } } * \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\dot{m } + \\dot{m}_w } , r \\leq r_{sph}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 in the above equations refers to the mass accretion rate propagations ( see ingram & done 2012 ) , @xmath63 is the mass rate lost through the wind and @xmath64 is the remaining accretion rate passing through the same radius ( which are also functions of @xmath16 and @xmath13 : p07 ) .",
    "to determine the likely timescales imprinted by this process we can consider the viscous timescale at @xmath11 for representative values , e.g. h / r ( disc scale height ) @xmath17 1 , @xmath65 ( viscosity parameter ) = 0.01 , @xmath13 = 1000 - 10000 ( e.g. as expected for an ss433 type system : fuchs et al .",
    "2003 ) and for a 10 - 100  m@xmath5 black hole , @xmath66 0.1 - 0.001  mhz .",
    "this is at the edge or beyond the typically observable bandpass ( due to current x - ray count rate limitations ) and so we should not expect large amounts of ` rapid ' variability ( e.g. tens to hundreds of seconds ) to be imprinted by this process as a result of dampening above @xmath67 .",
    "however , it is clear that even where @xmath11 is large , the timescales of both methods could , in principle , overlap .    importantly , as opposed to the contribution from single wind elements ( method 1 ) , at small inclinations the imprinted non - gaussian variability via propagated fluctuations will _ not _ average out . the total variability for a single ulx",
    "will then be a combination of the two methods - although at small inclinations we should only expect variability by this second process - and a power density spectrum ( pds ) resulting from the combination .",
    "although it may be tempting to produce test pds from the combination of the two methods ( specifically for those ulxs at moderate inclinations ) , we caution that the relative normalisations are unknown and doing so would lead to misleading results . in spite of the unknowns",
    ", we can make predictions resulting from variations in @xmath13 within a combined model of the spectrum and variability as presented in the following subsection and section 3 .",
    "[ for clarity , we reiterate that , as opposed to the origin of variability via method 1 , variability via propagating flux variations through the supercritical inflow can imprint onto the emission via the hot disc directly _ only _ if the scale height is not small ( i.e. not a thin disc ) and/or via scattering events from the global changes in radial mass loss in the wind ( which does not rely upon the inner disc being intrinsically variable ) . ]      as @xmath68 @xmath18 , increasing the mass transfer rate has a predictable effect on the observed variability and mean energy spectrum for those sources where we view into the evacuated funnel of the wind .",
    "we assume that the majority of the beamed emission is from the innermost regions such that any changes in spectral hardness ( denoted in the following formulae as @xmath69 ) are a result of the changing amount of beaming as the cone closes ( @xmath70 @xmath71 : king & puchnarewicz 2002 ; king 2009 ) .",
    "we also assume that the power ( fractional rms squared , from method 2 ) , referred to hereafter as @xmath72 , which we approximate by a power - law with index , @xmath73 0 ( i.e. not white ) , is seen in a fixed frequency bandpass . as a result of increasing the mass accretion rate from @xmath74 to @xmath75",
    ", we expect @xmath11 to increase , moving the pds dilution break to lower frequencies , reducing the power in our bandpass ( by effectively moving the whole pds to lower frequencies ) .",
    "we can subsequently derive the expected correlation between spectral hardness and power ( for method 2 only ) . from king ( 2009 ) , we expect : @xmath76    assuming that all of the power is dominated by the lowest frequencies , consistent with a decaying / diluted power above @xmath67 : @xmath77    note in the above equation that the index would usually be -@xmath60 but as the pds is moving to lower frequencies with increasing @xmath13 , across a fixed bandpass , the ratio of observed powers is inverted . to help illustrate this point we have shown the shift in pds with increasing @xmath11 in figure 3 .",
    "l    as we wish to consider the movement of the pds with @xmath13 , we can use the shift of the dilution break , @xmath67 , which scales as @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 : @xmath81    combining the above , it is straightforward to see that : @xmath82    by taking logarithms we then obtain : @xmath83    we note that , in the case of the above , @xmath60 is intuitively also a function of @xmath13 as the effect of dampening is expected to scale with @xmath63 ( see equation 26 of p07 ) .",
    "whilst there are several assumptions , it is clear that the general trend between spectral hardness and power will be an anti - correlation when considering only method 2 , i.e. specifically for those ulxs viewed at smaller inclinations .    as a final caveat ,",
    "we note that we have only considered the variability to be a modulation of the high energy emission from the hot inner disc ( via scattering and/or directly ) , however , stochastic variability via method 2 may also lead to some variability of the intrinsic wind emission ( the likely advection dominated flow from @xmath11 to @xmath84 ) by varying the column density of material and thereby changing the colour temperature correction ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "although this too will tend to average out at small @xmath53 for individual elements ( method 1 ) , the longer timescale trends introduced by the radial inhomogeneities will leave a global imprint which , once again , should not average out . however , assuming that the soft emission has the same physical origin in all ulxs , then the lack of variability observed in ngc 5408 x-1 at these energies ( middleton et al .",
    "2011 ) , implies that such variability is likely to be relatively weak .",
    "in order to make a set of predictions for how the properties of ulxs should evolve , we must consider _ both _ of the methods discussed above and the spectral - variability patterns we should expect to result from changes in @xmath13 . the predictions which follow",
    "are , by necessity , only semi - quantitative ; a full and accurate quantitative picture can only be obtained from full radiative simulations which include the nature and impact of instabilities on the short timescale variability ( and are beyond the scope of this work ) .    for the following predictions , we assume that the inflow is super - critical ( or is responding in the manner of being such : bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ) with the wind launched from the disc such that increasing @xmath13 will still increase the scale - height of the inflow further .",
    "we also assume that emission from the sub - critical disc beyond the wind is negligible ( i.e. @xmath13 is large enough that emission beyond @xmath11 is out of the x - ray bandpass ) .",
    "the inclination of the observer s line - of - sight and how this intercepts the wind ( @xmath53 in figure 1 ) is pivotal to the observed spectrum and power .",
    "we therefore dispense with past descriptive terms for ulxs based on the spectral shape alone and instead present an inclination dependent description based on the line - of - sight indicated in figure 1 . + * sources at small @xmath53 : *    at small inclinations , where the wind does not enter the line - of - sight ( position 1 in figure 1 ) , the observer sees the maximum unobscured emission from the hot inner ` disc ' as well as the scattered flux from the cone of the wind .",
    "we therefore expect a spectrum with a strong hard component with a beaming factor scaling as @xmath39 ( king & puchnarewicz 2002 ; king 2009 ) .",
    "such a spectrum would correspond to the ` hard ultraluminous ' class in sutton et al .",

    "we may also see variability on similar timescales in the intrinsic wind emission possibly due to the changing radial density profile and therefore @xmath85 , although as scattering events are predicted to dominate the emission ( via beaming ) , we might not expect this component to dominate the fractional variability ( although we may still detect it s presence in an absolute variability spectrum ) .    at these inclinations ,",

    "any variable , scattered emission from the hot disc must also pass through the larger optical depth inflow / outflow where reprocessing will redistribute it to lower energies ( as with the inner disc emission ) and , as we assume the soft emission from the wind to be relatively stable , dilute the fractional imprint ( and therefore power ) .",

    "we note that the time - averaged , best - fitting , high - energy spectral component ( nthcomp ) overestimates the true component at soft energies .",
    "this results from tying the two spectral components together to ensure physical energy balance ( section 3 ) but does not account for the changing temperature profile of the wind plasma . as a result",
    ", the soft component is not modelled accurately ( by diskbb in our fitting ) and could conceivably allow for contribution from advection ( p07 ) .",
    "whilst this does not cause problems for the inferred spectral evolution with variability ( nor the apparent lack of a disc component in the covariance spectrum ) , it highlights the need for caution when obtaining characteristic temperatures and spectral parameters from fitting to broad continua .",
    "however , the variability spectrum should provide a means to model the soft component more accurately in future , thereby allowing us to probe its nature more thoroughly .",
    "we note that , whilst the covariance spectra point towards issues in characterising the soft component , the rollover at high energies should be unaffected .",
    "whilst the nature of this component is still unclear , if we identify it with the hot inner disc ( see e.g. walton et al .",
    "2014 ) then the change in position of the rollover across the population should result from the changing amount of wind down - scattering the peak to lower energies . whilst this seems broadly consistent with those sources where we believe the wind to have entered our line - of - sight ( e.g. ngc 5204 x-1 , ngc 1313 x-1 , ngc 55 ulx-1 : see figures 5 & 7 ) , quantifying the change in temperature is a relatively complex issue but one we will address in a future work .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model that results from considering the structure of the super - critical accretion flow ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; p07 ; king 2009 ) , clumps formed through radiative - hydrodynamic instabilities ( takeuchi et al . 2014 ) and propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations ( lyubarskii 1997 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 ; ingram & done 2012 ) .",
    "this invokes two methods of generating variability ; via clumps themselves on short timescales and via longer timescale trends imprinted via propagating fluctuations . combining the expected changes in the spectrum with",
    "the variability leads to a set of spectral - timing predictions which depend on inclination and accretion rate ( section 3 and figure 4 ) . in order to test our predictions",
    ", we have analysed a sample of nine ulxs which are bright in flux ( thereby providing the highest - quality available statistics ) and avoid those ulxs which are likely to be bhbs with less extreme mass transfer rates .",
    "although there is considerable scatter , we find that the trend of spectral hardness with variability power - taking the sample as a whole - is consistent with the predicted evolution ( figures 4 & 8) and a significantly negative slope which is inconsistent with accretion onto imbhs ( if we assume these would follow the ubiquitous path in hardness - variability of bhbs : belloni 2010 ; muoz - darias et al . 2011 ) .",
    "such a finding is therefore consistent with the spectral properties being associated with super - critical accretion ( as suggested by the mass measurement of a bright ulx : motch et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we present the covariance spectra of those sources where data allows for the first time .",
    "we note that these are broadly consistent with the expectation of obscuration / scattering / intrinsic variability of the inner disc ( i.e. only the hard component varying ) , although the quality is not sufficient for detecting the subtle deviations we predict should be present . whilst the shapes of the covariance spectra are also consistent with a variable high energy component / corona as seen in bhbs ( although we strongly rule out a power - law shape for this component in the time - averaged spectra ) , we note that there appears to be very little / no contribution in any source by the soft component , inconsistent with what is seen in bhbs in the low - hard state ( wilkinson & uttley 2009 ) , where disc reprocessing leads to a variable component . whilst this appears to indicate that the emission is not analogous to that seen in the low - state of bhbs , we also reiterate that , more importantly , the global trend in hardness - variability does not appear to match predictions for such a model invoking analogous accretion onto imbhs .",
    "whilst the covariance spectra in general do not show evidence that unambiguously links the sources to the model we have presented , in the specific case of ngc 55 ulx-1 we observe evidence for down - scattering of the radiation , which argues against the variable hard component being seen directly .",
    "finally , the covariance spectra highlight the present degeneracies inherent in modelling ulx spectra ; notably the contribution of the soft component was generally underestimated , although future studies making use of such a technique should be able to better determine the shape of the soft component and more accurately constrain its evolution with luminosity .    although other models may be able to explain _ some _ of the behaviours of ulxs , the one we present here benefits from also being able to explain the lack of narrow atomic features in the x - ray spectra of the hardest ulxs ( e.g. walton et al .",
    "2012 ; 2013b ) - explained by the inner , scattering surface of the wind - cone being highly ionised by the strongly beamed flux - and possible presence of strong broad absorption features in the softest ulxs ( middleton et al .",
    "we briefly note that variability caused by scattering from clumps in the manner described in our model will lead to variable illumination onto the optically thin expanded wind at larger radial distances ( directly and indirectly via reprocessing ) .",
    "although we recognise that there are multiple explanations , should the ionisation state of this material change as a result , then we should expect changes in the ( possibly broad ) atomic features ( middleton et al .",
    "2014 ) which could then explain the ` soft lag ' discovered in the cross spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 ( heil & vaughan 2010 , de marco et al . 2013 ) .",
    "another possible explanation is a change in the soft continuum in response to the variable hard emission ( with the lag corresponding to the extra light travel time ) ; the covariance spectra of ngc 5408 x-1 would imply that the soft component as a whole does not contribute significantly to the variability but we can not rule out a ring of material with a small area being illuminated at the inner edge of the wind .",
    "such behaviour may place independent constraints on the geometry and we will investigate this in a future , dedicated paper .    there is clearly still a great deal of work left to be done in exploring the more complex predictions of such a model and any outliers that could be associated with unusual and exciting objects ( e.g. hlx-1 : farrell et al .",
    "2009 , m82 x-1 : pasham , strohmayer & mushotzky 2014 , m82 x-2 : bachetti et a. 2014 ) .",
    "key to making progress will be to utilise the new powerful spectral - timing techniques , investigate the nature of the broad - band spectra ( as _ nustar _ is demonstrating to great effect ) and obtain high quality spectra from multiple epochs , which next - generation missions such as _ athena _ will regularly produce .",
