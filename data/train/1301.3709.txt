    "this article originated from the notes of an invited talk at the clay mathematics institute summer school on `` the resolution of singular algebraic varieties '' in obergurgl , austria , 2012 .",
    "as the whole school was devoted to desingularization , the focus in this particular contribution is on applications and on practical aspects",
    ". a general knowledge of resolution of singularities and different approaches to this task is assumed and can be acquired from other parts of this proceedings volume .",
    "the overall goal of this article is to give readers a first impression of a small choice of applications and point them to good sources for further reading on each of the subjects .",
    "a detailed treatment of each of the topics would fill an article by itself and is thus beyond the scope here .",
    "+ one focus here is on the practical side . to this end , we first revisit desingularization algorithms in section 2 and have a closer look at the representation of resolution data : as a consequence of the heavy use of blowing up , the data is distributed over a rather large number of charts which need to be glued appropriately . glueing , however , only describes the theoretical side of the process ; from the practical point of view , it is closer to an identification of common points in charts . + in section 3",
    "we focus on applications needing different amounts of resolution data . using an abstract resolution of singularities",
    "only , the computation of the intersection form and dual graph of the resolution for surface singularities requires the smallest amount of data . for determining discrepancies and the log - canonical threshold ,",
    "we already need an embedded resolution which is also required for the third application , the computation of the topological zeta function . + in the rather short last section , we only sketch two settings in which one might want to use algorithmic desingularization as an experimental tool : the roots of the bernstein - sato polynomial and resolution experiments in positive characteristic . this last part is not intended to provide actual research projects .",
    "it is only intended to help develop a feeling for settings in which experiments can be helpful .",
    "+ all parts of the article are illustrated by the same simple example which is desingularized using a variant of villamayor s algorithm available in singular .",
    "based on this resolution data , all further applications are also accompanied by the corresponding singular - code . the singular code is not explained in detail , but hints and explanations on the appearing commands and their output are provided as comments in the examples . to further familiarize with the use of singular in this context , we recommend that the readers try out the given session themselves and use the built - in manual of singular to obtain further information on the commands ( e.g. : help resolve ; returns the help page of the command resolve ) .",
    "+ i would like to thank the organizers of the summer school for the invitation .",
    "insights from conversations with many colleagues have contributed to the content of these notes . in particular",
    ", i would like to thank herwig hauser , gerhard pfister , ignacio luengo , alejandro melle , frank - olaf schreyer , wolfram decker , hans schnemann , duco van straten , nobuki takayama , shaowei lin , frank kiraly , bernd sturmfels , zach teitler , nero budur , rocio blanco and santiago encinas for comments , of which some led to applications explained here and some others helped seeing the applications in broader context .",
    "for reading earlier versions of this article and many helpful questions on the subject of this article , i am indepted to frithjof schulze and bas heijne .",
    "before turning toward applications of resolution of singularities , we need to review certain aspects of algorithmic desingularization to understand the way in which the computed resolution data is represented .",
    "although there are various settings in which different resolution algorithms have been created , we may discern three main approaches suitable for the purposes of this article : the algorithms based on hironaka s proof in characteristic zero in any dimension ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the algorithms for binomial and toric ideals ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the algorithms for 2-dimensional varieties and schemes ( such as @xcite  based on @xcite  or @xcite ) . the algorithms of the first kind of approach involve embedded desingularization , i.e. they blow up a smooth ambient space and consider the strict transform of the variety and the exceptional divisors inside the new ambient space . the algorithms for 2-dimensional varieties on the other hand , do not consider the embedded situation , but blow up the variety itself and consider exceptional divisors inside the blown up variety .",
    "+ it would be beyond the scope of this article to cover all these algorithms in depth , but they all have certain ingredients in common . in the first two situations ,",
    "a desingularization is achieved by finite sequences of blow - ups at suitable non - singular centers .",
    "the differences between these algorithms then lie in the choice of center , which is the key step of each of these , but does not affect the structure of the practical representation of resolution data . for the third class of algorithms , blow - ups are not the only tool , but are combined with other tools , in particular normalization steps .",
    "however , the exceptional divisors to be studied arise from blow - ups and additionally only require proper tracing through the normalization steps if necessary .",
    "therefore the technique to focus on in this context is blowing up ; more precisely blowing up at non - singular centers .",
    "+      let us briefly recall the definition of blowing up , as it can be found in any textbook on algebraic geometry ( e.g. @xcite ) , before explaining its computational side :    let @xmath0 be a scheme and @xmath1 a subscheme corresponding to a coherent ideal sheaf @xmath2 .",
    "the blowing up of @xmath0 with center @xmath3 is @xmath4 let @xmath5 be a closed subscheme and @xmath6 the blow up of @xmath7 along @xmath8",
    ". then the following diagram commutes @xmath9 @xmath10 is called the strict transform of @xmath7 , @xmath11 the total transform of @xmath7 .    to make @xmath12 accessible to explicit computations of examples in computer algebra systems",
    ", it should best be described as the zero set of an ideal in a suitable ring .",
    "we shall assume now for simplicity of presentation that @xmath0 is affine because schemes are usually represented in computer algebra systems by means of affine covers .",
    "so we are dealing with the following situation : @xmath13 is the vanishing ideal of the center @xmath14 and the task is to compute @xmath15 to this end , we consider the canonical graded @xmath16-algebra homomorphism @xmath17 \\longrightarrow     \\bigoplus_{n\\geq 0 } j^nt^tn \\subset a[t]\\ ] ] defined by @xmath18 .",
    "the desired object @xmath19 is then isomorphic to @xmath20/ker(\\phi)\\ ] ] or from the more geometric point of view @xmath21 .",
    "+ the computation of the kernel in the above considerations is a standard basis computation and further such computations arise during the calculation of suitable centers in the different algorithms .",
    "moreover , each blowing up introduces a further set of new variables as we have just seen and desingularization is hardly ever achieved with just one or two blow - ups  usually we are seeing long sequences thereof .",
    "the performance of standard bases based algorithms , on the other hand , is very sensitive to the number of variables as its complexity is doubly exponential in this number .",
    "therefore it is vital from the practical point of view to pass from the @xmath22 to @xmath23 affine charts and pursue the resolution process further in each of the charts ; consistency of the choice of centers does not pose a problem at this stage as this follows from the underlying desingularization algorithm .",
    "although this creates an often very large tree of charts with the final charts being the leaves and although it postpones a certain part of the work , this approach has a further important advantage : it allows parallel computation by treating several charts on different processors or cores at the same time . + as a sideremark , we also want to mention the computation of the transforms , because they appeared in the definition cited above ; for simplicity of notation we only state the affine case . without any computational effort",
    ", we obtain the exceptional divisor as @xmath24 and the total transform @xmath25 for a subvariety @xmath26 in our affine chart .",
    "the strict transform is then obtained by a saturation , i.e. an iteration of ideal quotients until it stabilizes : @xmath27 ; for the weak transform , the iteration stops before it stabilizes , namely at the point where multiplying with the ideal of the exceptional divisor gives back the result of the previous iteration step for the last time .",
    "these ideal quotient computations are again based on standard bases . +      as we have just seen , it is more useful for the overall performance to pass to affine charts after each blow - up , even though this leads to an often rather large tree of charts . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to directly work with the result without any preparation steps , namely identifying points which are present in more than one chart  a practical step equivalent to the glueing of the charts .",
    "this is of particular interest for the identification of exceptional divisors which are present in more than one chart .    for the identification of points in different charts ,",
    "we need to pass through the tree of charts  from one final chart all the way back to the last common ancestor of the two charts and then forward to the other final chart . as blowing up",
    "is an isomorphism away from the center , this step does not pose any problems as long as we do not need to identify points lying on an exceptional divisor which was not yet created in the last common ancestor chart . in the latter case , however , we do not have a direct means of keeping track of points originating from the same point of the center .",
    "the way out of this dilemma is a representation of points on the exceptional divisor as the intersection of the exceptional divisor with an auxilliary variety not contained in the exceptional divisor .",
    "more formally , the following simple observation from commutative algebra can be used :    let @xmath28 $ ] be a prime ideal , @xmath29 $ ] another ideal such that @xmath30 is equidimensional and @xmath31 for some integer @xmath32 .",
    "then there exist polynomials @xmath33 and a polynomial @xmath34 $ ] such that @xmath35    at first glance , this seems non - constructive , but it turns out to be applicable in a very convenient way : in our situation , @xmath36 describes the intersection of exceptional divisors containing the point ( or subvariety @xmath37 ) in question .",
    "as any sufficiently general set of polynomials @xmath38 with correct height of @xmath39 will serve our purpose and so will any @xmath40 that excludes all extra components of @xmath41 , we have sufficient freedom of choice of @xmath42 such that none of these is contained in any further exceptional divisor whose moment of birth has to be crossed during the blowing down process .",
    "+ given this means of identification of points , we can now also identify the exceptional divisors or , more precisely , the centers leading to the respective exceptional divisors . to avoid unnecessary comparisons between centers in different charts",
    ", we can a priori rule out all comparisons involving centers lying in different exceptional divisors .",
    "if the desingularization is controlled by an invariant as in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , we can also avoid comparisons with different values of the controlling invariant , because these can not give birth to the same exceptional divisor either .    to illustrate the explanations given so far and to provide a practical example to be used for all further applications , we now consider an isolated surface singularity of type @xmath43 at the origin .",
    "we shall illustrate this example using the computer algebra system singular ( @xcite ) .    ....",

    ", one needs to consider the centers computed in charts 6 and 7 which turn out to be the intersection of the exceptional divisors labeled @xmath52 and @xmath53 , if one considers the output of the resolution process in detail .",

    "the applications we present in this section originate from different subfields of mathematics ranging from algebraic geometry to singularity theory and @xmath54-modules . for each application",
    "we shall revisit our example from the previous section and also show how to perform the corresponding computation using singular .      given a resolution of an isolated surface singularity ,",
    "we want to compute the intersection matrix of the excpetional divisors .",
    "this task does not require an embedded resolution of singularities , only an abstract one .",
    "given such a desingularization , it can then be split up into 3 different subtasks :    * computation of the intersections @xmath55 for exceptional curves @xmath56 * computation of the self - intersection numbers @xmath57 for the exceptional curves @xmath58 * representation of the result as the dual graph of the resolution    if the given resolution , is not an abstract one , but an embedded one - like the result of villamayor s algorithm - we need to add a preliminary step    * determine an abstract resolution from an embedded one .",
    "although the definition of intersection numbers of divisors on surfaces can be found in many textbooks on algebraic geometry ( e.g. in @xcite , v.1 ) , we give a brief summary of the used properties for readers convenience :    let @xmath59 be divisors in general position and @xmath60 are in general position , if the intersection @xmath61 is either empty or a finite set of points . ] on a non - singular surface @xmath0 .",
    "then the intersection number of @xmath62 and @xmath60 is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the intersection multiplicity of @xmath62 and @xmath60 at @xmath65 .    for any divisors @xmath62 and @xmath60 on a non - singular surface @xmath0 , there exist divisors @xmath66 and @xmath67 , linearly equivalent to @xmath62 and @xmath60 respectively , such that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are in general position .",

    "we know what we want to compute , but we have to take care of another practical problem before proceeding to the actual computation which is then a straight forward calculation of the intersection numbers of exceptional curves @xmath56 .",
    "the practical problem is that computations in a computer algebra system usually take place in polynomial rings over the rationals or algebraic extensions thereof .",
    "so we easily achieve a decomposition of the exceptional divisor into @xmath72-irreducible components , but we need to consider @xmath73-irreducible components to obtain the intersection matrix we expect from the theoretical point of view . to this end , passing to suitable extensions of the ground field may be necessary  be it explicitly by introducing a new variable and a minimal polynomial ( slowing down subsequent computations ) or implicitly by taking into account the number of components over @xmath73 for each @xmath72-component .    revisiting our example of a desingularization of an @xmath43 surface singularity , we first need to pass to an abstract resolution .",

    "but looking at the charts in more detail , we would see e.g. in chart 4 that the first divisor is given by @xmath74 and the second one by @xmath75 .",
    "so each of these has two @xmath73-irreducible components . considering these @xmath73-components",
    ", we can obtain the following intersection data ( seeing two of the intersections directly in chart 4 and the remaining one in chart 5 ) : @xmath76 hence only the self - intersection numbers  marked as * in the matrix  are still missing .    for the self - intersection numbers of the exceptional curves , we need to make use of another property of divisors in the context of desingularization :    let @xmath77 be a resolution of singularities of a surface @xmath0 .",

    "for the dual graph of the resolution , each divisor is represented by a vertex ( those with self - intersection -2 are unlabeled , the other ones labeled by their self - intersection number ) , each intersection is represented by an edge linking the two vertices corresponding to the intersecting exceptional curves .",

    "in contrast to the last task , which only required an abstract resolution of the given surface singularity , the task of computing ( log-)discrepancies and the log - canonical threshold requires embedded desingularization ( or principalization of ideals ) .",

    "the previous section showed some examples in which desingularization was a crucial step in the calculation of certain invariants and was hence used as a theoretical and practical tool .",
    "we now turn our interest to a different kind of settings : experiments on open questions which involve desingularization . here",
    "we only sketch two such topics and the way one could experiment in the respective setting .      in the early 1970s",
    "j.bernstein @xcite and m.sato @xcite independently defined an object in the theory of d - modules , which is nowadays called the bernstein - sato polynomial .",
    "the roots of such polynomials have a close , but still somewhat mysterious relation to the multiplicities of exceptional divisors in a related desingularization . for briefly recalling the definition of bernstein - sato polynomials",
    ", we shall follow the article of kashiwara @xcite , which also introduces this relation .",
    "after that we sketch what computer algebra tools are available in singular for experiments on this topic .",
    "let @xmath40 be an analytic function defined on some complex manifold @xmath0 of dimension @xmath133 and let @xmath134 be the sheaf of differential operators of finite order on @xmath0 .",
    "the polynomials in an additional variable @xmath135 satisfying @xmath136 f^{s+1}\\ ] ] form an ideal . a generator of this ideal",
    "is called the bernstein - sato polynomial and denoted by @xmath137 .",
    "more precisely , a principalization of the ideal generated by @xmath40 leads to a polynomial @xmath142 with a local system of coordinates @xmath143 .",
    "for @xmath144 the bernstein - sato polynomial is known to be @xmath145 therefore the roots of the bernstein - sato polynomial are negative rational numbers of the form @xmath146 with exceptional mulitplicities @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "yet it is not clear at all whether there are any rules or patterns which exceptional multiplicities @xmath147 actually appear as denominators of roots of the bernstein - sato polynomial .",
    "( as a sideremark : if this were known , then such knowledge could be used to speed up computations of bernstein - sato polynomials whenever a desingularization is known . )",
    "+ today there are implemented algorithms for computing the bernstein - sato polynomial of a given @xmath40 available : by ucha and castro - jiminez @xcite , andres , levandovskyy and martin - morales @xcite and by berkesh and leykin @xcite .",
    "all of these algorithms do not use desingularization techniques , but rather rely on grbner - bases and annihilator computations .",
    "the computed objects , however , are also used ( theoretically and in examples ) in the context of multiplier ideals and thus have relation to invariants like the log - canonical threshold .",
    "+ given algorithmic ways to independently compute the bernstein - sato polynomial and the exceptional multiplicities , one could now revisit the exploration of the interplay between these and try to spot patterns to get a better understanding .",
    "desingularization in positive characteristic is one of the long standing , central open problems in algebraic geometry . in dimensions up to three",
    "there is a positive answer ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , but in the general case there are several different approaches ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) each of which has run into obstacles which are currently not resolved .",
    "+ about a decade ago , hauser started studying the reasons why hironaka s approach of characteristic zero fails in positive characteristic @xcite . among other findings , he singled out two central points which break down :    1 .",
    "failure of maximal contact : + hypersurfaces of maximal contact are central to the descent in ambient dimension which in turn is the key to finding the correct centers for blowing up . in positive characteristic",
    ", it is well known that hypersurfaces of maximal contact need not exist ; allowing hypersurfaces satisfying only slightly weaker conditions is one of the central steps in the approach of hauser and wagner for dimension 2 @xcite .",
    "( for higher dimensions this definition requires a little bit more care @xcite . )",
    "increase of order of coefficient ideal : + as the improvement of the singularities is measured by the decrease of the order and of orders for further auxilliary ideals constructed by means of descent in ambient dimension , it is crucial for the proof of termination of resolution that these orders can not increase under blowing up .",
    "unfortunately this does no longer hold for the orders of the auxilliary ideals in positive characteristic as has again been known since the 1970s .",
    "hauser characterized the structure of polynomials which can exhibit such behaviour in @xcite .",
    "although problems of desingularization in positive characteristic are known , this knowledge seems to be not yet broad enough to provide sufficient feedback for suitable modification of one of the approaches to overcome the respective obstacles .",
    "experiments could prove to be helpful to open up a new point of view .",
    "in particular , the approach of hauser and wagner for surfaces is sufficiently close to the characteristic zero approach of hironaka ( and hence to algorithmic approaches like the one of villamayor ) to allow modification of an existing implementation to provide a tool for a structured search for examples with special properties also in higher dimensions .",
    "this has e.g. been pursued in @xcite .",
