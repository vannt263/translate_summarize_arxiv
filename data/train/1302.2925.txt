    "requires physical insight , diligent scrutiny of data , and/or extreme flexibility in order to ensure capturing the parameters that describe sn  ia heterogeneity .",

    "synthetic photometry and uncertainties are generated for each of the blueshifted des filter sets when there is sufficient wavelength coverage , including the few cases when data from only one arm of the snifs spectrograph is available .",
    "spectra from the two arms generally provide coverage of des @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath5 for @xmath2 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 ; these redshifts provide different restframe wavelength ranges with which to calibrate supernova absolute magnitudes .",
