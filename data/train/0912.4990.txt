    "cosmic rays ( crs ) up to @xmath5ev are most likely accelerated in galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) shocks via the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is believed to be highly non - linear , due to the expected coupling between the evolution of the thermal plasma , the crs , and the magnetic turbulence in the shock vicinity .",
    "indeed , there is now observational evidence suggesting that electrons are being accelerated in the non - relativistic shocks of snrs , and that significant magnetic turbulence is being produced as part of the process ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evidence comes from x - ray observations of snrs that show the existence of thin , non - thermal rims , which are interpreted as synchrotron emission by tev electrons accelerated at the shocks .",
    "the rapid variability and thinness of the rims ( which depend on the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons ) have allowed to estimate the strength of the field , suggesting downstream amplitudes @xmath0 times larger than typically expected in the ism of the galaxy .",
    "this implies a significant amplification even accounting for the compression of the field at the shock , which would contribute a factor of @xmath6 to the growth of the field .",
    "the origin of this strong amplification is an open question . on the one hand , using mhd shock simulations , @xcite showed that the presence of density and magnetic fluctuations in the upstream medium of non - relativistic shocks may introduce vorticity into the flow and produce field amplification at the shock itself ( see , also , * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism would produce a magnetic enhancement larger than expected from the simple shock compression of the upstream field .",
    "on the other hand , it has been proposed that the magnetic field may be amplified by plasma instabilities driven by the crs themselves , as they propagate through the upstream medium of shocks @xcite .",
    "this idea is interesting because , besides helping to explain the field amplification , the implied magnetic turbulence would increase the cr confinement to the shock vicinity , enhancing the efficiency of dsa .",
    "due to this , understanding the extent to which magnetic fields are amplified by crs , as well as characterizing the corresponding magnetic turbulence , is essential for any realistic model of dsa .",
    "the cosmic ray current - driven ( crcd ) instability proposed by @xcite has gathered considerable attention recently .",
    "the crcd instability consists of circularly polarized alfvn - type waves , driven by the electric current of crs propagating along the magnetic field lines .",
    "it requires the cr larmor radii , @xmath7 , to be much larger than the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the magnitude of the initial magnetic field , the cr current , and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "this feature makes this instability different from the previously proposed resonant instability , in which the waves grow at wavelengths comparable to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of the crcd instability is given by @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the mass density of the background plasma .",
    "for the typical conditions of cr - modified snr shocks ( where the energy densities of crs , @xmath14 , downstream thermal plasma , @xmath15 , and magnetic field,@xmath16 , satisfy @xmath17 ) , this rate is expected to be significantly larger than that of the resonant instability .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the crcd instability has been studied using both mhd @xcite and particle - in - cell ( pic ) @xcite simulations",
    ". both kinds of studies showed that the crcd instability has the potential of growing to very non - linear amplitudes as long as the cr current is kept constant , i.e. , if the back - reaction on the cr trajectories is neglected .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that , at constant cr current , the field growth stops when the alfvn velocity of the background plasma , @xmath18 , gets close to the cr drift velocity , @xmath19 .",
    "however , pic studies show that if the cr back - reaction is considered , the field can also saturate due to the trapping of the crs in the amplified field . when @xmath7 becomes comparable to the dominant length scale of the magnetic turbulence , the crs get strongly deflected , which significantly reduces their current and quenches the magnetic growth .",
    "this is the most likely saturation mechanism in the case of snrs , which implies a _ maximum _",
    "amplification factor of @xmath1 in the upstream medium of shocks , and confirms the crcd instability as a viable mechanism for magnetic turbulence generation in snrs @xcite .",
    "when the field compression at the shock is considered , this amplification may increase by an extra factor of @xmath6 .",
    "however , since the upstream amplification factor of @xmath20 constitutes an upper limit , the crcd instability alone would not be enough to account for the factor of @xmath0 inferred from the x - ray observations .",
    "in this paper we study the possibility of magnetic amplification beyond the saturation of the crcd instability .",
    "the situation we explore is one where crs propagate through a plasma where previous crcd magnetic turbulence has already been produced on scales larger than the typical cr larmor radius , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , our analysis would be applicable to the lower energy crs , which are more confined to the shock vicinity .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the crcd instability is probably driven first by the highest energy crs , in regions far upstream from the shock .",
    "this instability saturates when the larmor radius of these high energy particles is about the length scale of the pre - amplified magnetic fluctuations , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , as the shock approaches , a large fraction of the cr energy will be carried by  magnetized \" crs , i.e. , crs with @xmath7 smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "then , near the shock , crs will find regions of pre - amplified , quasi - transverse field , which can be considered homogeneous on scales @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 , then crs will not easily diffuse through the regions of pre - amplified field .",
    "instead , they will protrude into these regions only by a distance of @xmath22 .",
    "this situation will produce a cr current , @xmath24 , perpendicular to the initial , pre - amplified field , @xmath25 , due to the coherent deflection experienced by crs in the  homogeneous \" ( on scales of @xmath22 ) magnetic field .",
    "we propose that , under these conditions , an extra magnetic amplification is possible due to a new instability : the _ perpendicular current - driven instability _ ( pcdi ) , which consists of purely growing , compressional waves that arise when @xmath24 is perpendicular to @xmath25 .    as we show below",
    ", the pcdi would produce larger magnetic amplifications compared to the crcd instability acting alone .",
    "in addition , this instability can amplify magnetic fluctuations on scales comparable to the larmor radii of the lowest energy crs , which would improve their diffusion and increase the efficiency of their acceleration at the shock .",
    "if this did not happen , the large - scale , transverse fields generated by crcd instability would hamper the low energy cr diffusion , which would probably shut off the acceleration of the crs that cause the crcd amplification in the first place .    in  [ sec",
    ": physics ] , we explain the physics of the pcdi . first , we show how the penetration of crs into the regions of pre - amplified field can give rise to a current , @xmath24 , perpendicular to the pre - amplified field , @xmath26 , and why we expect that situation to happen in the upstream medium of snr shocks .",
    "then , we show how the presence of a @xmath24 perpendicular to @xmath26 can produce the pcdi , and derive its dispersion relation . in  [ sec : simulations ] , we show the results of our study of the pcdi using pic simulations . first , we model the non - linear evolution of the instability assuming a constant cr current , i.e. , ignoring the back - reaction on the crs , and provide a simple analytical model for the non - linear behavior of the pcdi modes .",
    "second , we show the results of a series of simulations that model the non - linear evolution of the pcdi including the full cr dynamics .",
    "the main focus is to show the role of the cr back - reaction on the final saturation of the instability . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we apply our results to the case of snr shocks .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the perpendicular current - driven instability ( pcdi ) is caused by a cr current , @xmath24 , perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field , @xmath25 . in  [ sec : anticorrelation ] , we show why we expect this @xmath27 to actually occur in the precursor of snr shocks . then , in  [ sec : dispersion ] we explain the physics of the pcdi growth , and derive its dispersion relation .      , in the upstream medium of snr shocks .",
    "the * upper panel * shows the downstream and upstream regions of a generic shock .",
    "regions of pre - amplified field in the upstream are represented by grey , doughnut - like shapes .",
    "black dots represent  magnetized \" crs , i.e. , crs whose larmor radii are smaller than the size of the regions of pre - amplified field .",
    "the * lower panel * shows a zoomed and rotated ( notice the orientation of coordinate axes in both panels ) image of the small , solid - line rectangle shown in the upper panel .",
    "this image is divided into region ",
    "a \" ( with low initial magnetic field ) , and region  b \" ( with the pre - amplified magnetic field @xmath25 ) .",

    " b \" by a distance @xmath28 , which defines the interface into which crs can protrude . as",
    "indicated in the figure , the coherent deflection of the crs in this region produces a net mean velocity along @xmath29 , of magnitude @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the small , dashed - line rectangle depicted in the upper panel represents the type of regions that we study in  [ sec : crback ] by using two - dimensional pic simulations.,width=325 ]    in this section , we show that a significant cr mean velocity perpendicular to an initial field , @xmath25 , can arise in the upstream medium of snr shocks , if there is a significant anti - correlation between the cr number density , @xmath31 , and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "if crs propagate through a smooth medium , as may be the case shortly after the shock formation , there is no reason to think that a significant anti - correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 can happen .",
    "however , if some magnetic turbulence has already been amplified , then this anti - correlation can exist .",
    "for instance , numerical mhd and pic simulations of the crcd instability ( see fig . 4 of @xcite or figs . 10 and 12 of @xcite )",
    "show how this instability produces turbulence characterized by typical plasma density contrast of @xmath1 , with frozen - in magnetic field concentrated in the high density regions . as discussed in @xcite , this kind of turbulence",
    "can be produced far upstream from the shock by high - energy crs  escaping \" at @xmath30 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that lower energy crs , which are more confined to the shock , will encounter the upstream medium with previously amplified magnetic turbulence .",
    "this is the situation depicted in the upper panel of figure [ fig : figure2 ] , which shows the regions in the upstream of a shock containing a pre - amplified magnetic field , @xmath33 ( diagrammatically represented by doughnut - like shapes in the figure ; note that , in reality , these  doughnuts \" are not necessarily in one plane ) surrounded by crs ( indicated by black dots ) . since the saturation of the crcd instability happens when the larmor radius of the highest energy crs is close to the length scale of the pre - amplified field , @xmath21 , then most crs near the shock are expected to have larmor radii , @xmath7 , that satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "we will refer to crs satisfying this condition as  magnetized \" crs .    in this scenario , crs will not be able to diffuse through the regions of pre - amplified field .",
    "instead , they will only be able to penetrate into these regions by a distance of @xmath35 .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ fig : figure2 ] depicts this situation .",
    "it shows a zoomed image of the interface between a region of low and high upstream magnetic field ( rectangular box in the upper panel).this plot is divided into two regions .",
    "region  a \" ( left ) , which contains the crs and where there is almost no initial magnetic field , and region  b \" ( right ) , where there is a pre - amplified magnetic field , @xmath25 , which has a length scale , @xmath21 , larger than the cr larmor radii , @xmath7 . since @xmath34 , crs protruding into region _ b _",
    "( by a distance @xmath35 ) will not experience random scatterings due to fluctuations in the field .",
    "instead , they will just complete a fraction ( typically @xmath36 ) of a larmor gyration before being scattered back into region _ a_. the fact that crs complete only a fraction of a larmor cycle in region _",
    "_ implies that , while in this region , they will tend to move parallel to @xmath37 ( i.e. , along @xmath29 in figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "thus , if crs have positive electric charge , they will produce a current , @xmath24 perpendicular to the pre - amplified field . ] .",
    "since crs are relativistic , their mean velocity perpendicular to @xmath25 will be a fraction ( of the order of @xmath36 ) of the speed of light , larger than the typical drift velocities along the field that drive the crcd instability .",
    "this suggests that it is possible to find upstream regions near snr shocks where @xmath24 can be quasi - perpendicular to @xmath25 .",
    "the formation of the perpendicular mean cr velocity at @xmath30 is confirmed in  [ sec : crback ] using two - dimensional pic simulations .",
    "the presence of the cr current , @xmath24 , perpendicular to the initial field , @xmath25 , induces a return current , @xmath38 , almost equal to @xmath39 in the background , @xmath38 is still almost equal to @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the compensating current is due to the polarization drift of particles , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the particle mass and charge , and @xmath43 is the electric field .",
    "it is possible to show from the ampres s law that , if @xmath44 , the return current produced by this drift ( acting mainly on the ions ) almost completely compensates the cr current ( see also lyutikov 2009 ) . ] .",
    "because of this , a constant force , @xmath45 , will push the plasma homogeneously .",
    "thus , if plasma density fluctuations , @xmath46 , exist , this @xmath45 force will accelerate the low density regions more than the ones with higher density . as we will see below",
    ", this differential plasma acceleration in the direction perpendicular to @xmath25 can amplify the transverse component of the magnetic field , @xmath47 , and enhance the density fluctuations in the plasma , producing the exponential growth of the pcdi modes .",
    "we note that this instability starts from a non - equilibrium state , where the whole plasma is being accelerated in the direction of @xmath45 .",
    "we derive the dispersion relation of the pcdi in the mhd limit .",
    "we assume the existence of an externally imposed cr current , @xmath27 .",
    "the way this cr current is produced and the back - reaction of the amplified field , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , on the cr trajectories is not modeled in this derivation .",
    "the current carried by the background plasma is @xmath50 , which includes the return current induced in the background .",
    "so the mhd equations will only be modified by an extra term in the force per unit volume on the plasma : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the plasma fluid velocity and @xmath55 is its pressure .",
    "although the crs can also include accelerated electrons , which would reduce the cr net charge , in general crs may carry a charge density , @xmath56 , that must be compensated by the background plasma .",
    "this extra plasma charge should introduce an electrostatic term in equation ( [ eq : euler2 ] ) due to plasma charge density fluctuations .",
    "it is possible to show that this term is second order in perturbation theory , so it can be neglected in our linear analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix [ app : b ] for further details .",
    "if each physical quantity @xmath57 is separated into an initial , homogeneous component , @xmath58 , plus a small perturbation , @xmath59 , ( so @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) , then the mhd momentum equation will have a zeroth order part : @xmath63 which represents homogeneous acceleration of the plasma .",
    "the first order quantities read : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the sound speed in the plasma and where we have chosen a reference frame where @xmath68 .",
    "the physical meaning of the different force terms in equation ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) can be understood with the help of figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "let perturbations @xmath47 and @xmath46 be such that the magnetic field lines and plasma density are represented by the solid and dotted lines of figure [ fig : figure1 ] , respectively . then , since the force @xmath69 is the same everywhere , regions of low density will accelerate more than regions of high density , making the overdense regions lag behind with respect to the rest of the plasma .",
    "this is the origin of the force @xmath70 in equation ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) .",
    "as shown by the solid black arrows in figure [ fig : figure1 ] , this force tends to stretch the lines of magnetic field and , therefore , produces the amplification of @xmath47 .",
    "this amplification can happen exponentially , because the growth of @xmath47 increases the force @xmath71 , which , as depicted in figure [ fig : figure1 ] , enhances the density contrast even more . in a sense ,",
    "the pcdi is similar to parker instability , since the magnetic growth implies the existence of regions of the plasma that accelerate more than others in the direction perpendicular to @xmath25 .",
    "however , whereas in the case of parker instability the amplification is driven by a homogeneous gravitational _ acceleration _ , the amplification of pcdi is caused by a homogeneous _ force _ , given by @xmath72 .    performing the fourier transform of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cont2 ] ) , ( [ eq : prob2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : law2 ] ) , and assuming that the fourier modes are stationary , with @xmath73 , it is straightforward to obtain the dispersion relation : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the growth rate corresponding to a given @xmath76 .",

    "we obtain that the fastest growing mode has the wave number , @xmath78 and the growth rate , @xmath79 where @xmath80(@xmath81 ) is the initial alfvn velocity in the plasma .",

    "the idea is to study the growth of the pcdi due to crs protruding into the regions of pre - amplified field region .",
    "since we use a monoenergetic population of crs , these particles are expected to penetrate by a distance comparable to two times their larmor radius , @xmath7 , which defines a region or interface where the field grows .",

    "the observed features of the pcdi turbulence are essentially the same as for the case of the externally imposed current : the non - linear field adopts a loop - like structure with very strong density contrasts ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "as was discussed before , the pcdi happens while the background plasma is being pushed by the @xmath184 force .",
    "this pushing can also amplify the field due to a simple field compression . in order to differentiate the growth due to the compression from the one due to the pcdi modes , the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : protru32 ] , [ fig : protru40 ] , and [ fig : protru44 ] show the results of an analogous simulation where the @xmath131 dimension of the box has been significantly reduced .",
    "this simulation behaves as a one - dimensional run , where the pcdi modes ( whose @xmath185 ) can not grow . we see that the magnetic amplification corresponding to this one - dimensional case is significantly smaller than the one due to the growth of the pcdi .",
    "our simulations show that , similarly to the case of the crcd instability , the field saturation happens when the larmor radii of the crs , @xmath7 , become comparable to the size of the generated magnetic fluctuations . in our fiducial simulation @xmath159 ,",
    "the magnetic field reaches saturation at @xmath160 ( figure [ fig : protru40 ] ) , where it is amplified by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the larmor radii of the crs,@xmath7 , should be @xmath186th of its initial value , @xmath187 .",
    "this coincides with the typical length scale of the magnetic fluctuations observed in figure [ fig : protru40 ] , where the distance is measured in units of @xmath187 .",
    "this saturation criterion can be understood in the same way as for the case of the crcd instability . since the magnetic growth is driven by the cr current ( in this case perpendicular to @xmath33 )",
    ", the growth will stop when this current is significantly reduced , which happens when cr trajectories are strongly perturbed by the generated field .",
    "this requires the length scale of the fluctuations to be comparable to @xmath7 .",
    "we check this in figure [ fig : protru44 ] , where the @xmath132 component of the cr mean velocity ( in regions where @xmath188 ) has been reduced to almost half of its value in figure [ fig : protru40 ] .    by considering the expected evolution of the size of the magnetic fluctuations ( @xmath189 ) and assuming that the cr mean velocity perpendicular to the field is @xmath30 , it is possible to estimate the maximum field reachable by the pcdi . if we make @xmath190 , where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the mass and charge of the crs , its possible to show that saturation will happen at @xmath193 .",
    "this implies that the field at saturation should be a factor of @xmath194 below energy equipartition with the crs .",
    "we can test this criterion by looking at panels d ) of figs .",
    "[ fig : protru40 ] and [ fig : protru44 ] .",
    "we see that the maximum amplification is about @xmath195 times smaller than the one corresponding to local energy equipartition between crs and magnetic field .",
    "the mean magnetic amplification is an extra factor of @xmath195 smaller , due to the existence of regions of very low density and magnetic field amplitude in the pcdi turbulence .",
    "we can also check this condition by seeing the saturation values of the field for simulations with the same cr energy density as in simulation @xmath159 , but with different values of @xmath9 .    ) as a function of @xmath130 at the moment of saturation for simulations analogue to @xmath159 , but with @xmath196 and 1/40 , respectively .",
    "the red and blue lines show the maximum and average amplification , respectively . and the black line shows the magnetic amplitude of a field at local energy equipartition with the crs.,width=302 ]    the left and right panels in figure [ fig : prosatura ] show the mean and maximum magnetic amplification as a function of @xmath130 at saturation for simulations with @xmath196 and 1/40 , respectively .",
    "again , the observed saturation is consistent with the mean magnetic field being @xmath197 times smaller than the one corresponding to energy equipartition with the crs .",
    "the main uncertainty in this saturation criterion is given by the particular cr energy distribution we use , which corresponds to monoenergetic crs .",
    "this implies that crs are able to penetrate into the simulation box by a distance shorter than @xmath173 .",
    "this defines a region or  interface \" where pcdi modes grow , with the rest of the plasma only being compressed due to the acceleration of the plasma in the interface .",
    "the beginning of the compression of the central part of the region of pre - amplified field can be seen in figure [ fig : protru44 ] , where the density of the background plasma shows prominent spikes at @xmath198 and 3 .",
    "however , in reality , crs should have a wide distribution of energies .",
    "so , in principle , the magnetized crs ( the ones with @xmath199 ) should be able to fill most of the volume of pre - amplified field .",
    "also , since the number density of the crs is expected to be a strongly decreasing function of their energy , low energy crs ( with small @xmath7 and , therefore , filling a small fraction of the volume of the pre - amplified field region ) will produce pcdi modes on length and time scales significantly shorter than the ones of the highest energy crs ( that still satisfy the magnetization condition , @xmath199 ) .",
    "thus , in a realistic setup , the growth of pcdi field should start at the boundary of the regions of pre - amplified field and then propagate towards their interior due to the action of higher energy particles . by choosing monoenergetic crs",
    ", we ignore this effect , and concentrate on capturing the basic physics of field amplification by the pcdi instability , including the growth of pcdi modes due to the formation of a @xmath24 perpendicular to @xmath26 , and the effect of the cr back - reaction on the final saturation of the instability .",
    "a more detailed study including the effect of a broad cr energy distribution will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have found that the saturation of the pcdi is determined by the cr back - reaction , and that it would imply magnetic fields @xmath194 times below energy equipartition with the crs .",
    "we can now apply this result to the expected conditions in the upstream medium of snr shocks .",
    "if we assume that all cr energy is carried by a monoenergetic cr population , we can estimate the maximum amplification factor given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the ratio between the energies of the crs , @xmath14 , and the one of the downstream thermal plasma , @xmath15 .",
    "the main uncertainty in this estimate is given by the assumption that crs are monoenergetic , so they will only amplify the field in an interface of width @xmath35 within the regions of pre - amplified magnetic field ( see lower panel in figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) . in reality , crs will have a wide distribution of energies , so they are expected to enter most of the volume where the field has been previously amplified .",
    "since the density of crs decreases with their energy , the growth of pcdi modes should happen faster in the outer part of the magnetized regions , and gradually propagate towards the inner parts due to the action of the higher energy crs .",
    "the exact details of how this process unfolds , and how it would change the estimated amplification of eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate ] ) , requires further study , taking into account more realistic cr energy distribution .    the maximum amplification [ eq : estimate ] is about 4 times larger than for the case of the crcd instability .",
    "since the saturation criteria of the two mechanisms are analogous , then the factor of @xmath6 is explained by the different mean cr velocities used for calculating the corresponding @xmath24 ( perpendicular and parallel to @xmath25 for the pcdi and crcd instability , respectively ) . while for the crcd instability the mean velocity of the crs can be considered close to @xmath202 , in the case of the pcdi it is @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the maximum amplification should differ by a factor @xmath203 ( @xmath204 for @xmath205km / s ) . if the estimate given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate ] ) were calculated considering the crs that are already diffusing with a speed of about @xmath202 , then both instabilities would saturate at about the same level .",
    "it is important to make sure that the pcdi would have time to grow before being advected into the shock .",
    "the growth of the pcdi field is expected to happen at a distance from the shock that is _ at least _",
    "the distance that crs protrude into the pre - amplified field , @xmath173 ( this would correspond to the field loop that is the closest to the shock , in figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "then , we can define an advection time , @xmath206 , that would be at least @xmath207 .",
    "in addition to that , the typical time scale of growth is given by the inverse of the growth rate of the instability , @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , the product @xmath209 ( assuming crs moving on average at @xmath30 ) shows that , as long as the growth of the field starts at a distance a few times larger than the typical cr larmor radius , the advection time would not be a restriction to the growth of the pcdi .    the pcdi would also contribute to the efficiency of the acceleration of particles at the shock .",
    "indeed , the fact that the field saturation happens at @xmath210 means that the lower energy crs would be able to generate magnetic fluctuations at length scales comparable to their larmor radii , which would increase their diffusion and , therefore , the efficiency of their shock acceleration .",
    "in this work we proposed a new plasma instability , the perpendicular current - driven instability ( pcdi ) , as a candidate to amplify magnetic fields due to crs diffusing in front of snr shocks .",
    "the pcdi consists of purely growing , compressional waves produced by the cr current , @xmath24 , perpendicular to the initial magnetic field , @xmath25 .",
    "the time and length scale of growth of the pcdi are similar to the ones of the crcd instability , i.e. , @xmath211 and @xmath212 . however , whereas the crcd instability is driven by a current _ parallel _ to @xmath25 , the pdci is produced by a current _ perpendicular _ to the initial field .",
    "thus , the fastest growing instability will be determined by whether @xmath24 is quasi - perpendicular or quasi - parallel to the @xmath25 .",
    "we show that , in the upstream medium of snr shocks , the required perpendicular current can be due to crs with larmor radii , @xmath7 , smaller than the length scale of a previously amplified magnetic turbulence , @xmath213 .",
    "this scenario is motivated by earlier pic studies showing that , far from the shock , the crcd instability can produce non - linear magnetic amplification , driven by the highest energy crs .",
    "this amplification , although limited to a factor of less than @xmath1 for the expected energy carried by crs , would be characterized by non - linear fluctuations in the plasma density and magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "the typical length scale of these fluctuations would be close to the larmor radius of the highest energy crs ( which is the saturation criterion that implies a maximum amplification factor of @xmath1 ) , producing a situation where most crs would have a @xmath7 significantly smaller than the typical size of the pre - amplified fluctuations .",
    "we show that , under these conditions , the current perpendicular to @xmath25 can be produced by lower energy crs protruding into the regions of pre - amplified field by a distance @xmath173 , which would give rise to a mean velocity of magnitude @xmath30 perpendicular to the field . due to this , in regions close to the shock , @xmath24 would be quasi - perpendicular to the field , making the pcdi grow faster and on length scales smaller than the scales of the crcd instability .",
    "we used the two - dimensional pic simulations to study the evolution of the pcdi .",
    "we showed that the instability exists and confirmed its theoretical growth rate .",
    "we also studied its possible saturation mechanisms , and found that the strong deflection of crs in the amplified field ultimately stops the magnetic growth , which happens when the the larmor radius of the crs , @xmath7 , is close to the size of the magnetic fluctuations , @xmath122 .",
    "this saturation mechanism is qualitatively the same as the one found for the crcd instability @xcite .",
    "however , since the perpendicular cr current is due to a cr mean velocity of magnitude @xmath30 , then the maximum magnetic field amplification would be @xmath194 times below energy equipartition with the crs . this would imply a maximum amplification factor in the upstream medium of the snr shocks of @xmath2 .",
    "the maximum downstream amplification could increase to @xmath214 , including the compression at the shock .",
    "the pcdi would also contribute to the efficiency of the acceleration of low energy particles at the shock , by providing magnetic fluctuation on scales comparable to their larmor radii , which allows them to diffuse .",
    "given the geometry of the pcdi ( see figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) , where the fluctuations in the fields and particle properties happen in a plane perpendicular to @xmath24 , we believe that our two - dimensional simulations ( with @xmath24 pointing out of the plane of the simulation ) are already capturing the essence of the instability",
    ". however , future three - dimensional simulations will be important to investigate possible extra effects that may appear by including the additional dimension .",
    "one interesting signature of the pcdi is that it predicts the amplified field , @xmath48 , that satisfies @xmath3 , assuming a weak dependence of @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) on @xmath202 .",
    "this relationship contrasts with the one obtained for the crcd instability acting alone , @xmath4 @xcite , and constitutes a possible observational test to shed light on the nature of the magnetic amplification in snr shocks ( see observational results of * ? ? ?",
    "although we have focused on the case of non - relativistic shocks in snrs , the pcdi may also be relevant for the case of upstream magnetic amplification in the relativistic shocks of jets and gamma ray bursts . in that case , as seen from the reference frame of the upstream medium , the crs will only experience a small deflection before being advected into the downstream medium of the shock .",
    "thus , crs will provide an electric current parallel to the shock normal that may also amplify pcdi modes .",
    "the amplification of magnetic field due to the expansion of magnetic loops ( as in the non - linear regime of the pcdi ) in the upstream medium of grb shocks was already discussed by @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the growth of the field would saturate when neighboring loops collide .",
    "our simulations show that these collisions do not stop the growth . instead",
    ", they make neighboring loops merge and grow in size .",
    "we also found that under certain conditions , electrostatic forces due to the charge separation involved in the expansion of the loops may contribute to the quenching of the nonlinear growth .",
    "this possibility requires a dedicated study , which will be presented elsewhere .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the pcdi constitutes a viable amplification mechanism that , in combination with the crcd instability , strengthens the idea of crs being responsible for the significant fraction of magnetic amplification inferred from snr shock observations .",

    "this way we have all the density and velocity fluctuations needed to calculate @xmath226 .",
    "if we are interested in the case where the cr back - reaction can be neglected , the value of @xmath226 can be calculated by taking the limit @xmath256 . in that case",
    "we obtain that @xmath257 thus , combining the ampere s and faraday s laws with eq .",
    "( [ eq : curr ] ) we recover eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "at @xmath180 .",
    "the electric field is normalized in terms of @xmath9.,width=340 ]    if crs are made of only positively charged particles , then the background plasma is expected to carry a negative , compensating charge that nearly cancels it . in ",
    "[ sec : constcurr ] we saw that this background charge may suppress the non - linear growth of the pcdi . in regions where the pcdi produces a decrease in the plasma density , a net positive charge will grow . in the linear regime , this net charge growth is not important .",
    "it creates an electric field proportional to the product of the charge fluctuations in the background plasma , which is approximately equal to @xmath258 , times the characteristic length scale of the fluctuations , which is proportional to @xmath259 .",
    "thus , the force on the plasma due to this effect is of second order in perturbation theory , and can be neglected . in the non - linear regime , however , this electrostatic force can be relevant .",
    "as the pcdi magnetic loops expands , the electric field in the loops will be given by @xmath260 , where @xmath261 points in the radial direction .",
    "thus , the loops will feel an electrostatic force @xmath262 , that will push them back to their center . recalling that ,",
    "when the amplified field becomes non - linear , @xmath263 , then this force will be of the order of @xmath264 if the crs move at an average velocity close to @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the force driving the expansion ( @xmath265 ) would be roughly compensated by this electrostatic force , which would quench the non - linear growth of the pcdi .",
    "this situation , however , would not happen when the pcdi is driven by crs protruding into regions of pre - amplified field , as suggested by the simulations presented in ",
    "[ sec : crback ] .",
    "the reason has to do with the way the compensating charge is distributed in the loops . as crs",
    "penetrate into the pre - amplified field regions , their electric current induces a return current in the plasma ( @xmath266 ) , which is what compensates the charge .",
    "however , if this happens while the loops are being formed , this return current will tend to separate charges within the loops , producing a dipolar charge distribution in them .",
    "this can be seen from the shape of the electric field , @xmath43 , shown in figure [ fig : protruelec ] , which depicts the same simulation region as figure [ fig : protruden ] . in the magnetic loops locations",
    ", @xmath43 does not have the monopolar shape needed to stop the loop expansion .",
    "instead , we see that , whereas the @xmath131 component has a monopolar shape , the @xmath130 component looks like a dipolar field , indicating the presence of charge separation within the loops . in the situation",
    "depicted in figure [ fig : protruelec ] , electrons accumulate to the right of the loops .",
    "thus , while the negative charge of the plasma concentrates mainly in regions where @xmath267 , the places where @xmath268 will be more neutral .",
    "thus , there will be parts of the loops where the electrostatic forces are less important than in the cases where the charge in the loops is distributed homogeneously ( like in the simulations presented in  [ sec : constcurr ] ) , and their evolution will be dominated by the @xmath269 force that expands the loops .",
    "this way , the pcdi can grow to non - linear amplitudes , even when the crs may be mainly composed of positively charged particles ."
