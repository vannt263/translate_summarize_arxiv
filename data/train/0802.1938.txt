    "an analysis due to stephen kleene  @xcite shows that , conversely , a positive arithmetic inductive definition can be used to define a complete @xmath16 set . in the 1960 s , georg kreisel presented axiomatic theories of such inductive definitions @xcite .",

    "we are particularly interested in obtaining a translation from @xmath17 to a constructive theory of such functions that makes it possible to `` read off '' a description of the witnessing function from the proof of a @xmath20 sentence in @xmath17 .",
    "there are currently two ways of obtaining this information .",
    "the first involves using ordinal analysis to reduce @xmath17 to a constructive analogue @xcite , such as the theory @xmath25 discussed below , and then using either a realizability argument or a dialectica interpretation of the latter @xcite .",

    "we present a new method of carrying out this first step , based on a functional interpretation along the lines of gdel s `` dialectica '' interpretation of first - order arithmetic .",

    "feferman @xcite used a dialectica interpretation to obtain ordinal bounds on the strength of @xmath17 ( the details are sketched in ( * ? ? ?",

    "take classical first - order peano arithmetic , @xmath30 , to be formulated in a language with symbols for each primitive recursive function and relation .",

    "specifically , let @xmath35 be an arithmetic formula with at most the free variable @xmath32 , in which the predicate symbol @xmath15 occurs only positively .",
    "we adopt the practice of writing @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath17 then includes the following axioms :    * @xmath38 * @xmath39 , for each formula @xmath40 .    here",
    ", the notation @xmath41 denotes the result of replacing each atomic formula @xmath42 with @xmath43 , renaming bound variables to prevent collisions .",
    "the first axiom asserts that @xmath33 is closed with respect to @xmath44 , while the second axiom schema expresses that @xmath33 is the smallest such set , among those sets that can be defined in the language .",
    "below we will use the fact that this schema , as well as the schema of induction , can be expressed as rules .",
    "for example , @xmath33-leastness is equivalent to the rule `` from @xmath45 conclude @xmath46 . '' to see this , note that the rule is easily justified using the corresponding axiom ; conversely , one obtains the axiom for @xmath40 by taking @xmath47 to be the formula @xmath48 in the rule .",
    "one can also design theories of inductive definitions based on intuitionistic logic . in order for these theories to be given a reasonable constructive interpretation , however , one needs to be more careful in specifying the positivity requirement on @xmath34 .",
    "one option is to insist that @xmath15 does not occur in the antecedent of any implication , where @xmath49 is taken to abbreviate @xmath50 .",
    "such a definition is said to be _ strictly positive _ , and we denote the corresponding axiomatic theory @xmath25 .",
    "an even more restrictive requirement is to insist that @xmath51 is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a primitive recursive relation .",
    "these are called _ accessibility _ inductive definitions , and serve to pick out the well - founded part of the relation . in the case where @xmath53 is the `` child - of '' relation on a tree , the inductive definition picks out the well - founded part of that tree .",
    "we will denote the corresponding theory @xmath54 .",
    "the following conservation theorem can be obtained via an ordinal analysis @xcite or the methods of buchholz  @xcite :    [ idone : conserve : thm ] every @xmath20 sentence provable in @xmath17 is provable in @xmath54 .",

    "these are defined in the expected way : @xmath416 bears the same relationship to @xmath415 that @xmath17 bears to @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , in @xmath416 one can introduce a inductive definitions given by formulas @xmath35 , where @xmath34 is a formula in the language of @xmath415 together with the new predicate @xmath15 , in which @xmath15 occurs only positively .",
    "writing @xmath417 for @xmath59 and @xmath418 for @xmath78 , we can now define a sequence of theories @xmath419 . for",
    "each @xmath420 take @xmath421 to add to @xmath419 a type @xmath422 of trees branching over @xmath423 , with corresponding constant @xmath79 and functionals @xmath424 and @xmath425 .",
    "once again , we extend primitive recursion in @xmath419 to the larger system and add a principle of primitive recursion on @xmath422 .",
    "the theories @xmath426 are defined analogously .",
    "it is convenient to act as though for each @xmath427 , @xmath428 is closed under unions indexed by @xmath429 ; this can arranged by fixing injections of each @xmath429 into @xmath430 .    in this section , we show that our interpretation extends to @xmath415 , to yield the following generalization of theorem  [ idone : witness : thm : a ] :    [ idone : witness : thm : z ] every @xmath20 sentence provable in @xmath415 is provable in @xmath431 .    as with theorem  [ idone :",
    "witness : thm : a ] , the proof yields a particular term witnessing the @xmath20 assertion , and the correctness of that witnessing term can be established in @xmath419 , by a generalization of theorem [ intuitionistic : theories : strength : thm : a ] . the interpretation can be further extended to theories of transfinitely iterated inductive definitions , as described in @xcite . we do not , however , know of any ordinary mathematical arguments that are naturally represented in such theories .    to extend the theories @xmath27 to theories @xmath432",
    ", we first have to generalize the schema of @xmath92-bounding .",
    "for each @xmath427 , define the schema of @xmath433-bounding as follows : @xmath434).\\ ] ] for every formula @xmath14 with quantifiers ranging over the types @xmath435 . with this notation ,",
    "the @xmath92-bounding schema is now corresponds to @xmath436-bounding .",
    "we extend the theories @xmath27 to theories @xmath432 in the expected way , where now @xmath432 includes the schema of @xmath433-bounding for each @xmath437 .",
    "the fixed points @xmath438 of @xmath415 are interpreted iteratively according to the recipe in section  [ embedding : section ] . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath439 is gives the definition of the @xmath125th inductively defined predicate @xmath440 , the translation of @xmath441 has quantifiers ranging over at most @xmath430 , and @xmath442 is interpreted as @xmath443 , where the predicates @xmath444 are defined in analogy to @xmath105 .",
    "this yields :    if @xmath415 proves @xmath14 , then @xmath432 proves @xmath445 .",
    "next , we define theories @xmath446 in analogy to the theory @xmath28 of section  [ functional : interp : section ] , except that we include the @xmath433-bounding axioms for @xmath447 in @xmath446 .",
    "now it is quantification over the types @xmath448 that is considered `` small , '' and absorbed into the target theory .",
    "in particular , for @xmath449 , the @xmath433-bounding axioms of @xmath432 are unchanged by the functional interpretation .",
    "the @xmath450 bounding axioms for @xmath451 , induction on @xmath59 , and transfinite induction on @xmath423 are interpreted as in section  [ functional : interp : section ] . with the corresponding modifications to @xmath209",
    ", we then have the analogue to theorem  [ functional : interp : thm ] :    suppose @xmath432 proves @xmath14 , and @xmath209 is the formula @xmath452 .",
    "then there are terms @xmath195 of @xmath419 involving at most the variables @xmath170 and the free variables of @xmath14 of type @xmath423 such that @xmath453 proves @xmath220 .    in the last step",
    ", we have to embed @xmath446 into an infinitary proof system in @xmath431 .",
    "the method of doing this is once again found in @xcite , and an extension of the argument described in section  [ cut : elim : section ] .",
    "we extend the definition of the infinitary propositional formulas so that when , for each @xmath454 with @xmath455 , @xmath456 is a formula , so are @xmath457 and @xmath458 .",
    "the proof of cut elimination , and the verification of transfinite induction and the defining axioms for the predicates @xmath444 , are essentially unchanged .",
    "the only additional work that is required is to handle the bounding axioms ; this is taken care of using a style of bounding argument that is fundamental to the ordinal analysis of such infinitary systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for every @xmath447 , @xmath431 proves the translation of the @xmath429-@xmath428 bounding axioms .",
    "since @xmath431 establishes the provability of the law of the excluded middle in the infinitary language , it suffices to show that for every sequent @xmath1 with quantifiers ranging over at most @xmath429 , if @xmath459 , then there is a @xmath174 in @xmath460 such that for every @xmath88 in @xmath429 , @xmath461)$ ] . but",
    "this is essentially a consequence of the `` boundedness lemma for @xmath462 '' in sieg  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* 2 ) ; the requisite @xmath174 is defined by an explicit recursion on the derivation .",
    "this gives us the proper analogue of theorem  [ last : step : thm ] , and hence theorem  [ idone : witness : thm : z ] .",
    "every @xmath20 theorem of @xmath453 is a theorem of @xmath431 .",
    "for completeness , we sketch a proof of proposition  [ kreisel : prop ] .",
    "full details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we associate to each node of an element of @xmath78 a finite sequence @xmath60 of natural numbers , where the @xmath122th child of the node corresponding to @xmath60 is assigned @xmath463 .",
    "then the subtree @xmath464 of @xmath88 rooted at @xmath60 ( or @xmath79 if @xmath60 is not a node of @xmath88 ) can be defined by recursion on @xmath78 as follows : @xmath465 here @xmath350 denotes the sequence of length @xmath351 .",
    "now , given @xmath14 , @xmath466 , and @xmath467 as in the statement of the lemma , we define a function @xmath468 by primitive recursion on @xmath87 .",
    "the function @xmath191 uses the the second clause of the rule to compute a sequence of pairs @xmath469 with the property that @xmath470 implies @xmath471 . for readability , we fix @xmath88 and @xmath32 and write @xmath472 instead of @xmath468 .",
    "we also write @xmath473 for @xmath474 and @xmath475 for @xmath476 . @xmath477",
    "ordinary induction on the natural numbers shows that for every @xmath87 , @xmath478 implies @xmath471 .",
    "so , it suffices to show that for some @xmath87 , @xmath479 .",
    "since @xmath480 is an increasing sequence of sequences , it suffices to establish the more general claim that for every @xmath88 and every function @xmath162 from @xmath59 to @xmath59 , there is an @xmath87 such that @xmath481 . to that end , by recursion on @xmath78 , define @xmath482 , { \\lambda n \\ ; } f(n+1 ) ) & \\mbox{if $ \\alpha \\neq e$ }       \\\\       0 & \\mbox{otherwise }    \\end{array } \\right . \\end{split}\\ ] ] let @xmath483 . by induction on @xmath484",
    "we have @xmath485 as long as @xmath486 . in particular , setting @xmath487 , we have @xmath488 , which implies @xmath489 , as required .",
    "consider the first rule .",
    "for any element @xmath88 of @xmath78 and finite sequence of natural numbers @xmath60 ( coded as a natural number ) , once again we let @xmath464 denote the subtree of @xmath88 rooted at @xmath60 .",

    "we will define a function @xmath490 by recursion on @xmath88 , which returns a function of type @xmath491 , with the property that @xmath492 , and for every @xmath60 , @xmath493 holds for every @xmath32 in the range of @xmath490 . applying the conclusion to @xmath494",
