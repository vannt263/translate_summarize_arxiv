    "a black hole accreting at the eddington rate will grow exponentially on a relatively short timescale ( a few @xmath16yr ) . if the black hole is small , feedback is suppressed exponentially , and surrounding gas can equilibrate with the low rate of energy or momentum input . however ,",
    "if the black hole is already large , it will be sufficiently luminous that the energy injected can not be radiated by the gas in a local dynamical time , effectively resulting in an instantaneous , point - like ( relative to the scales of the galaxy ) energy injection in the center of an ( approximately spherical ) bulge which dominates the local gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to describe this phase as a sedov - taylor type blast wave , which , in detail , a number of simulations have shown is a surprisingly good approximation to a full solution including radiative cooling , the pressure of the external medium , magnetic and gravitational fields , and further effects , at least on galaxy @xcite and larger @xcite scales .    here , we determine the behavior of such a blast wave when energy is input from black hole accretion into a medium with an initial density gradient .",
    "in particular , we derive an approximation to the internal density , velocity , and temperature structure of the blast wave as a function of time , which becomes exact as @xmath17 . using this",
    ", we can calculate the evolution of the bondi - hoyle accretion rate for a central black hole at @xmath18 .",
    "however , because the bondi rate is not calculated self - consistently in a medium with external density and velocity gradients , we use our solution for the internal blast wave structure to derive a solution for a perturbative inflow driven by the black hole gravitational potential at small radii .",
    "many authors have considered the evolution of blast waves and the detailed clumping and radiative properties of their interiors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "( for a discussion of the different sedov - taylor radial shells or phases see e.g.@xcite . )",
    "these works have focused on understanding the radiative properties of such blast waves , and have not calculated an accretion rate solution within them or examined the interior properties as they affect the small radii relevant for accretion processes .    for simplicity , we assume a power - law scaling for the external ( pre - shock ) density , @xmath19 appropriate for a spheroid or black hole - dominated potential or molecular cloud . note that this need hold only over some range in @xmath20 for each `` stage '' of the blast wave .",
    "we are , for now , interested in early times during the wave and ( by definition of the blowout `` triggering '' condition ) blast waves with energy greater than the binding energy of the material , so at least in this phase we can consider gravity to be a second - order effect which we calculate in detail below .    under these circumstances , the system will evolve as a similarity solution , in which the shock radius @xmath21 expands as @xmath22 these similarity solutions are well - understood , and we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "once the system enters the blast wave - dominated phase , the central accretion rate will decline with time , in power - law fashion when the surrounding medium evolves according to a similarity solution .",
    "we derive this below ; for now note that we expect @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the total energy of the blast wave evolves as @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "radiative losses from the blast wave front are small , at least on the scales of interest here @xcite . however ,",
    "if feedback energy continues to couple to the surrounding medium as the accretion rate declines , there are two possible cases .",
    "first , if @xmath27 then the blast wave is dominated by the initial energy input , and the evolution is effectively energy conserving with @xmath28 .",

    ", we obtain a similarity solution for the shock radius of the form @xmath30      we determine the internal structure of the blast wave using the two - power approximation ( tpa ) for the internal velocity and density structure . unlike e.g.  a one - power approximation , this ensures that gradients behave physically at small radii . in general , a quantity @xmath31 will have the scaling @xmath32 internal to the blast wave , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the post - shock value of @xmath31 at the shock front . from @xcite ,",
    "this gives @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( the second equalities are for @xmath37 ) .",
    "these are determined by requiring the gradients to match exact solutions at the center and shock front and imposing mass conservation .",
    "the corresponding velocity approximation is @xmath38 with @xmath39    the expressions reduce to an exact solution for @xmath37 , @xmath40 . for other cases ,",
    "they provide a good approximation for our purposes , accurate to @xmath41 even for @xmath42 .",
    "the accuracy improves at small radii , and these solutions capture the correct power - law dependence as @xmath17 where , for example , kahn s approximation @xcite for the density and velocity structure , which is accurate to @xmath43 @xcite reduces to the expressions above .",
    "these also provide a good description of observed blast wave velocity and temperature structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ".    given the density and velocity field , it is straightforward to determine the interior pressure . for an adiabatic blast wave ,",
    "the entropy per unit mass is conserved in comoving coordinates , giving @xmath44 this yields @xmath45 for the pressure as @xmath46 . for a blast wave with no energy injection ,",
    "then , we recover the well - known condition that the pressure is constant at the origin .    in detail , we can use the equation of motion to solve for the pressure terms . inserting the density and velocity fields into the equation of motion and solving yields a six - term power - law solution for the pressure @xmath47 with @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the coefficient of the @xmath50 term in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "because @xmath53 at @xmath54 , we obtain a solution for @xmath55 . in terms of @xmath56",
    "@xmath57 this yields an expression for @xmath58 which is quite complicated , reducing for e.g.  @xmath28 , @xmath37 to @xmath59 which interpolates from @xmath60 for @xmath42 to @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "however , the full expression for @xmath58 from the six - power expansion is reasonably well approximated ( to @xmath63 for a variety of @xmath64 ) by the simpler form @xmath65}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{4\\,(3-k_{\\rho}-k_{e})}{24 - 9\\,k_{\\rho}+6\\,k_{e } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which follows from the pressure - gradient approximation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , essentially a two - power approximation in the pressure .",
    "the next - order term , @xmath66 , which is proportional to the local @xmath67 , is given by @xmath68 this goes to zero for @xmath37 , @xmath69 , but this is because in this case @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and a proper solution yields @xmath72 it is straightforward to derive the remaining terms , but we are interested only in the behavior as @xmath17 , so we do not need higher - order terms in @xmath50 .",
    "we can now determine the bondi accretion rate as a function of radius , again for @xmath17 , given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant of order unity dependent on the gas equation of state , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the local gas density and sound speed , respectively and @xmath77 is the bulk motion of the gas relative to the black hole .",
    "near the origin , @xmath78constant , thus @xmath79    so , at some point , an inward - moving bondi - like flow can grow and give a residual accretion rate , and if the shock wave continues to blow mass out of the central regions , the scaling should be similar to the time scaling above . the effective `` accretion radius '' at which this will occur is , however , ambiguous .",
    "a natural choice is the black hole radius of influence , @xmath80 where @xmath6 is the bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "this follows from equating the black hole potential to the external potential , and determines where the black hole dominates the dynamics .",
    "we could instead consider the trans - sonic radius , @xmath81 however , once @xmath82 , the trans - sonic radius will be larger than the black hole radius of influence , regardless of how @xmath83 scales with @xmath84 , and the black hole will not affect the dynamics .",
    "for the inner regions ( or intermediate regions for @xmath85 ) , we have @xmath86 , so @xmath87 at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the ratio of the black hole to the ( total ) spheroid stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath90 is defined as the spheroid dynamical time ( with @xmath91 being the bulge scale length ) .",
    "thus the timescale for @xmath92 is @xmath93yr , much less than the timescales of interest , and so it is inappropriate to consider accretion through @xmath94 as it is outside the region where the black hole will have a significant effect on the kinematics .",
    "even if some of the post - shock gas avoids cooling adiabatically and slows / compresses to pressure equilibrium , this will necessarily give @xmath95 , so @xmath96 and again @xmath97 is the appropriate radius to consider .",
    "since we expect the accretion rate to decline rapidly with time , the black hole mass is approximately constant over this period ( see   [ sec : mass.blowout ] for a detailed calculation ) , so for a fixed accretion radius @xmath98 this then gives @xmath99 this equation for @xmath100 expands to @xmath101 for a rapidly declining accretion rate with @xmath102 ( i.e.  valid for @xmath103 , @xmath104 for @xmath37 ) .",
    "for a less rapidly declining accretion rate with @xmath105 ( i.e. @xmath106 ) we obtain a self - consistent solution with @xmath107 which is valid for all @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( @xmath110 for @xmath37 ) .",
    "together , these form a continuous class of self - consistent solutions for all @xmath111 .",
    "although the above derivation gives a reasonable solution for @xmath112 and its scaling with time , in agreement with simulations @xcite , it is not strictly appropriate to adopt the bondi - hoyle rate at some radius , as the full blast wave solution represents an outflow .",
    "however , in the sedov - taylor solution , a given mass shell interior to the blast wave decelerates with time , and eventually the gravitational potential will dominate the dynamics .",
    "shells with smaller initial @xmath113 begin with smaller relative velocities and decelerate more quickly , and will successively `` turn around '' and fall back establishing a bondi - hoyle - like steady accretion flow .",
    "therefore , we expect a mode of inflow in the inner regions which grows relative to the decaying blast wave solution , with the inflow smaller at early times when the blast wave is propagating rapidly ( although the inflow may decay with time in an absolute sense ) .",
    "the gravitational term in the equation of motion is a perturbation , which will induce corresponding perturbations in the velocity and density .",
    "we can , therefore , describe this inflow as a perturbation about the exact blast wave solution .",
    "we consider the density and velocity perturbations @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and demand that the first order perturbation to the mass inflow rate @xmath116 be constant in radius ( although not necessarily in time ) .",
    "our method and this assumption are identical to that used to derive the bondi solution , but considered in a medium with a pre - existing large density and velocity field ( and consequently first - order @xmath117 ) .",
    "the first - order continuity equation is @xmath118 so @xmath119 and @xmath120 because @xmath121 is constant in @xmath20 .",
    "the equation of motion @xmath122 ( where @xmath123 is the gravitational potential and represents the driving first - order correction ) is then completely determined , if we assume the perturbation is adiabatic ; i.e.  if @xmath124 the full equation of motion then reduces to the equation of motion for the perturbation @xmath125}\\\\ & &   \\nu_{0}\\equiv a_{v}\\,\\nu_{1}\\,\\eta=\\frac{\\eta}{\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      first , consider @xmath37 , @xmath102 , @xmath40 , for which the power - law approximations we have adopted and formulae above are an exact solution for the internal structure of the blast wave .",
    "note that for this case ( as indicated above ) our @xmath126 is inappropriate and the equations above should take @xmath127 in this case , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and the time dependence of @xmath130 cancels completely , and since @xmath131 is a function only of time and @xmath132 is a function only of @xmath20 , it must be true that @xmath133 goes to zero or a constant .",
    "then , both reduce to the same solution , namely @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an arbitrary normalization radius .",
    "the equation for @xmath132 has a general solution with @xmath136 , but this is not of interest as the central mass diverges strongly .",
    "this leaves the specific solution for @xmath132 .",
    "let us define @xmath137 where e.g.  @xmath138 for the potential at short distances ( dominated by the black hole ) or large distances ( when the galaxy potential is effectively a point - mass ) and @xmath139 for intermediate distances in e.g. a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile .",
    "this gives @xmath140 where the second equality comes from setting the arbitrary @xmath141 and using @xmath142 .",
    "we show in   [ sec : timescales ] that the characteristic blowout timescales @xmath143 are @xmath144 as defined here , indeed giving @xmath145 at least for early times when the blast wave speed exceeds the escape velocity ( such a condition guarantees @xmath146 ) .",
    "this solution determines a self - consistent power - law slope for the decay of the accretion rate @xmath121 .",
    "the perturbation @xmath121 is independent of radius , whereas the blast wave outflow @xmath147 falls at small @xmath20 , meaning that the perturbation will eventually dominate at small @xmath20 , as expected .",
    "the perturbations @xmath132 and @xmath148 both decline with radius , meaning that each is individually also important only at small radii , and vanish at large radii @xmath149 where the blast wave structure is dominant .",
    "the decline of @xmath121 with time is less rapid than the decline of the blast wave @xmath112 , reflecting the fact that as the blast wave expands , slows down , and cools , the gravitational potential and accretion solution will increasingly dominate ( albeit still with a declining accretion rate as gas continues to flow out of the central regions and be shocked to virial temperatures ) .",
    "this perturbative approach to calculating the accretion rate does not , however , determine the absolute normalization of that accretion rate , essentially an arbitrary parameter in the above equations , but within the radius where the steady accretion flow dominates , a bondi - like spherical flow should set in and detailed simulations suggest that the bondi - estimated normalization is a reasonable approximation @xcite .",
    "we now extend this solution to cases where @xmath150 ( i.e.  @xmath151 or @xmath152 ) .",
    "because the power - law approximations to the density and velocity profiles are then not exact , the cancellation of the time dependence of @xmath130 is imperfect , but we can show that the remaining factor is small .",
    "if we neglect this small remainder , then a solution is obtained for @xmath153 or @xmath154constant .",
    "the latter case always yields the @xmath155 solution .",
    "the former ( @xmath153 ) yields one of two classes of solutions . if the accretion feedback decouples from the surrounding medium after the initial injection ( i.e.   @xmath102 , independent of @xmath100 ) , then the general solution @xmath156 is obtained .",
    "if the accretion feedback remains coupled to the blast wave , i.e.  @xmath105 for @xmath109 , then a self - consistent solution is obtained with @xmath157 these are similar , with @xmath100 within @xmath158 for a given @xmath108 , regardless of whether the accretion feedback continues to couple to the surrounding blast wave .",
    "this implies that while such coupling may significantly affect the growth of the blast wave front , it does not dramatically change the time structure of the @xmath17 accretion rate once the initial blast wave has grown .    for each , a corresponding solution for @xmath132",
    "is obtained , similar to that for @xmath37 , @xmath102 , @xmath62 . in all cases ,",
    "the general solution for @xmath132 has such a steep @xmath20 dependence that it is generally not of interest , but the specific solution is given by @xmath159 which may increase with @xmath20 , but always does so slower than the internal blast wave density profile @xmath160 and thus satisfies the necessary perturbative conditions .",
    "when @xmath154constant , i.e.  @xmath161 , a second specific solution also exists with @xmath162 which may be of interest near the origin , and although the enclosed mass formally diverges , in reality the density profile will flatten once the perturbation dominates and a standard bondi - type solution sets in , giving a coulomb logarithm .",
    "we noted above that the time - dependent terms in @xmath130 do not entirely cancel in these approximations , and thus the solutions above are not exact .",
    "however , the residuals are small . if we apply the solutions above , then considering @xmath163 , we find that indeed @xmath164 is small , meaning this is not a bad approximation over any limited time range .",
    "the worst case is the @xmath105 , @xmath165 solution , for which @xmath166 .",
    "however , generally the cancellation is more complete ; for example for @xmath42 we obtain @xmath167 for the @xmath102 and @xmath105 solutions , respectively .      at late times",
    ", the internal blast wave velocity falls and the gas will not continue to cool indefinitely . the criterion for this can be determined exactly , but is essentially @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the _ local _ dynamical time ( distinct from the global dynamical time @xmath170 which we generally refer to ) .",
    "the entropy of the post - shock gas is large , and the sound speed is @xmath171 , so as the gas cools and slows , a quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium is established , with @xmath172 if @xmath75 can be separated into space and time dependent parts ( as for a power - law dependence of @xmath75 on time ) , the time dependence of @xmath75 factors out of these equations , and @xmath83 remains nearly constant at fixed @xmath20 while @xmath173 slowly declines as the residual outflow carries away mass .",
    "this approximation is valid ( i.e.   @xmath83 remains roughly constant given by the equations above while @xmath75 decreases ) so long as @xmath174 .",
    "then , we can approximate the residual velocity and decay of @xmath75 with the original blast wave solution extrapolated to these late times . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not appropriate , as at these times the potential becomes important and the solutions above are not necessarily valid .",
    "however , we can either : ( 1 ) consider special cases in which they remain a valid solution , or ( 2 ) perform a perturbative analysis again , but this time the blast wave solution is the perturbation to the quasi - static solution on large scales , determining a net decline in the density of the central regions .",
    "the perturbative analysis demonstrates that the blast wave solution is a self - consistent perturbation solution for @xmath175 , implying that the late - time behavior @xmath176 is indeed appropriate .",
    "this gives @xmath177 with @xmath103 ; i.e.  @xmath102 for all self - consistent solutions , as should be true for the late stages of the accretion rate evolution when the blast wave is weak and expanding far from the origin .",
    "note that for the special case @xmath37 , @xmath40 , the proper solution becomes @xmath178 ( instead of @xmath161 as implied above , this is because the @xmath179 is not valid in this specific case as noted above , and the exact @xmath180 should instead be used ) .",
    "appropriately , this solution reduces to the scaling derived by @xcite for the self - similar collapse of a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath62 ) with no initial velocity field , as the bulk outflow velocity is increasingly small relative to the escape velocity .",
    "this solution is important for late - time galactic - scale outflows , at low @xmath112 , but is less relevant for e.g.  accretion of cold clouds or supernova remnants , as the dense medium through which the blast wave propagates is sub - galactic .",
    "now , we wish to determine the appropriate timescale for the accretion rate evolution calculated in   [ sec : deriv ] .",
    "it is convenient to employ the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath181 , with @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath184yr is the salpeter ( 1964 ) time .",

    "there are three regimes relevant to our calculation of black hole growth .",
    "first , there is a period of rapid ( high-@xmath187 ) accretion , where accretion rate is high enough to be eddington - limited .",
    "this proceeds efficiently as the black hole grows at low masses , radiating at low enough luminosity that the nearby gas can still cool and be accreted .",
    "the second regime is the beginning of the blowout  when the black hole becomes large enough that e.g.  the feedback energy input into the surrounding medium in a local cooling or dynamical time is sufficient to unbind the gas .",
    "effectively , the gas is `` superheated '' in the potential of the galaxy and the medium enters the sedov - taylor type solution of equation  ( [ eqn : t.powerlaw ] ) . of course",
    ", since the implied bondi - hoyle accretion rate is much larger than the eddington rate , it will take some time @xmath188 for the bondi rate to fall to @xmath189 .",
    "beyond this point , the third regime is entered and the actual accretion rate begins to decline .",
    "if @xmath190 at the beginning of the `` blowout '' ( second phase ) and @xmath188 is defined as the time for the bondi rate to fall to @xmath191 , then the subsequent accretion rate is given by @xmath192 we did not attempt to calculate the timescale @xmath188 from our analytical model in @xcite , as it does not affect our analysis of the faint - end slope of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "however , this quantity determines the relative contributions of e.g.  stochastic accretion and relaxation from bright , high-@xmath187 phases in mergers , so we calculate it here .    during the blowout",
    ", the accretion rate drops to that given by the internal structure of the blast wave in equation  ( [ eqn : rho.cs3 ] ) @xmath193 the relevant radius for calculating the accretion rate is , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : deriv ] , the black hole radius of influence @xmath194 . for convenience , we normalize the accretion rate to @xmath195 and define @xmath196 .",
    "the accretion rate for @xmath197 is then @xmath198 , with @xmath199 and @xmath100 is as in equations  ( [ eqn : eta.l.decoupled ] ) and ( [ eqn : eta.l.coupled ] ) . therefore @xmath200 at @xmath201    to solve for @xmath202 , we consider the properties of the central regions of the merger , for which the stellar bulge has , in general , nearly finished forming by the time the `` blowout '' occurs @xcite .",
    "we define a characteristic bulge radius @xmath91 by @xmath203 which is similar to the half - mass or half - light bulge radius ( with the exact proportionality constant relating the two depending on the shape of the bulge profile ) .",
    "the definition for @xmath204 gives the relation @xmath205 ( where @xmath206 is the ratio of black hole to bulge stellar mass ) .",
    "we can relate the spheroid and black hole properties via the black hole - bulge mass relation of @xcite and @xmath1 relation of @xcite ( see equation  [ [ eqn : mbh.scalings ] ] ) , which then imply @xmath207 @xmath208 where we have defined the bulge dynamical time above and @xmath209kpc , @xmath210yr for @xmath211 .",
    "it is also useful to define an effective gas mass fraction ( just before the `` blowout '' ) @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the total bulge mass fraction in gas ( @xmath214 ) , evaluated at the time of the `` blowout '' ( usually @xmath215 ) and @xmath216 is a correction for the shape of the galaxy profile ( i.e.  for the fact that our definition of @xmath91 is not equivalent to the half mass radius ) , with e.g.   @xmath217/[3\\,(3+\\sqrt{2})^{3}]=0.07 $ ] and @xmath218 for @xcite and isothermal sphere profiles , respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath219 combining these equations and scaling by @xmath220 gives @xmath221    the energy condition for blowout , namely that sufficient energy be released to rapidly unbind the surrounding gas , is given by @xmath222 , with a well - defined @xmath223 at @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , with these choices , @xmath224 we can then use equation  ( [ eqn : tq.of.tacc ] ) to determine @xmath188 : @xmath225    for the simplest , self - similar example of sedov - taylor expansion under conditions resembling our simulations , we have @xmath178 , @xmath129 , which corresponds to the solution in e.g.  an isothermal sphere , wind , or any @xmath226 velocity structure , and indeed this provides a good first - order approximation to the blowout phase over a wide range of conditions @xcite . in this case",

    "we expect @xmath227 , as is essentially guaranteed by the blowout condition that the sudden energy input be sufficient to unbind the gas locally .",
    "we also expect @xmath228 , since it is inflows of cold gas from the merging disks which are being accreted .",
    "this gives @xmath229 here , we have again used the @xmath230 relation to replace the @xmath6 dependence with an @xmath231 term .",
    "direct comparison with the best - fit to the blowout in our simulations shows such a trend , with a scatter of a factor @xmath232 about the relation above . this scatter is smaller than that implied by the various factors above , but this may be because several are correlated .",
    "next , consider the accretion of a molecular cloud . as we describe in ",
    "[ sec : rates ] , we expect clouds to be moving at a speed @xmath233 near the black hole , with characteristic gas densities @xmath234 .",
    "this gives an initial bondi - hoyle accretion rate @xmath235 ( limited to @xmath236 ) for all black hole masses of interest .",
    "provided that the black hole has grown large enough to lie on the @xmath1 relation ( see   [ sec : m.sigma ] ) , it will release sufficient feedback to unbind the molecular cloud in a timescale @xmath237yr . because this is small compared to the salpeter time , the cloud crossing time , the cloud dynamical time , and the timescale for the moderate and low - accretion rate phases of the `` blowout ''",
    ", we can effectively treat such an event as if it enters the blowout phase immediately upon the `` collision '' with the cloud .",
    "the calculation of the relevant timescale for the accretion rate decay is identical to that in   [",
    "sec : merger.timescale ] , since the typical cloud radius is larger than the black hole radius of influence , especially at the relatively small masses of interest .",
    "however , the surrounding medium is not the same , and the condition for `` blowout '' is modified by the need to unbind a local cloud of cold gas as opposed to the entire gas content of central regions of the galaxy . for a molecular cloud , we expect @xmath42 ( at least effectively , since the black hole does not necessarily lie at the cloud center ) , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 with @xmath240 .",
    "the speed @xmath241 at some radius and time is given by @xmath242 .",
    "we again define @xmath243 as the time at which @xmath195 .",

    "consider first the simple case of an energy - conserving blast wave , in which the accretion rate declines quickly enough that the energy input is dominated by the initial accretion ( or applicable if e.g.  the ionization or initial blowout of the inner regions de - couples the blast front from the black hole feedback ) . simulations of particular wind mechanisms find that driving is efficient for @xmath250 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also suggests this is an accurate approximation .",
    "the blowout condition essentially defines the blast wave energy , as that required to unbind and expel the cloud @xmath251 this implies @xmath238 , and plugging this in we obtain @xmath252 where @xmath253 is approximately constant , at least until the late stages of the blast wave evolution .    using this result in equation  ( [ eqn : mdot.rbh ] ) ,",
    "again normalizing to @xmath97 , we obtain an equation for @xmath254 .",
    "we again re - normalize to @xmath255 , giving @xmath256 .",
    "solving gives @xmath257 finally , we use @xmath42 , @xmath102 , adopt the @xmath1 relation as an initial condition , and take @xmath37 ( @xmath258 for the bondi solution ) to obtain @xmath259 where the @xmath260 term is a small , order unity correction which depends weakly on the properties of the system .",
    "this more detailed analysis recovers the expected scaling , that the characteristic timescale for accretion decay is given by the cloud size divided by the local escape velocity ; i.e.  approximately the velocity at which the cloud will be unbound and expelled .",
    "although we have solved this in detail for the @xmath37 , @xmath42 case , a similar calculation for different values of @xmath261 , @xmath108 , @xmath100 , and @xmath262 gives a nearly identical equation for @xmath188 , with small , order unity numerical changes to the coefficient of @xmath263 as expected from equation  ( [ eqn : tmdot.full ] ) and slightly different power - law coefficients for the terms in @xmath260 , with similar weak dependencies on @xmath6 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 in @xmath260 .",
    "one important point to check is that our approximation of a constant @xmath2 is reasonable .",
    "for @xmath188 we have @xmath266 which is much less than the salpeter time ( @xmath267 ) , and so the black hole mass is roughly constant during blowout .",
    "this also means that once the system enters blowout , the accretion rate drops below @xmath236 immediately , and so a pure - power law decay is a good approximation when considering the probability of viewing the black hole at a given @xmath268",
    ".    for the luminosity - dependent seyfert lifetime , a power - law accretion time history of the form in equation  ( [ eqn : mdot.pwrlaw ] ) gives @xmath269 which we can use to infer the probability of observing a system at a given accretion rate .",
    "since @xmath2 is roughly constant once the blowout begins , this can be directly translated to a distribution in luminosity using @xmath270 .",
    "if we consider a black hole in a system with a significant disk or other cold gaseous component which extends near the center , then there will be some probability for the black hole to cross paths with a dense molecular cloud .",
    "the timescale between collisions with clouds is @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the number density of cold clouds , @xmath273 is their typical size ( giving a cloud cross - section @xmath274 ) , and @xmath275 is their characteristic random velocity . although the gravitational interaction with the black hole is a long - range force , the effective cross section for interaction with a cloud will be @xmath276 if the black hole radius of influence , @xmath277 is much smaller than the cloud size , which for a typical large molecular cloud with @xmath278pc is satisfied for all black hole masses of interest , especially for the small @xmath2 characteristic of late - type systems .",
    "the typical random cloud velocity is essentially the vertical velocity dispersion of the disk , @xmath279 , in order to maintain pressure support . in any case",
    ", the value of @xmath280 is relatively unimportant as we demonstrate that it ultimately cancels below .",
    "the cloud number density is @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the volume filling factor of cold clouds , so @xmath283 therefore , a large fraction of black holes in disk - dominated systems should have undergone such an event , although we determine the effective `` duty cycle '' more completely below .",
    "next , we consider how @xmath282 and @xmath284 scale with host galaxy properties . because most of the gas in the ism resides in cold clouds ,",
    "the cloud filling factor is @xmath285 ( where @xmath286 and @xmath287 are the average ism and cloud gas densities , respectively ) independent of the size distribution or shapes of clouds . for an exponential disk with total gas mass @xmath288 ,",
    "the surface density profile is @xmath289 in the central regions of the disk ( taking @xmath17 , @xmath290 ) , this resembles an isothermal sheet with constant scale height @xmath291 , @xmath292 the scale height @xmath291 is in general given by @xmath293 , where @xmath294 is the circular velocity .",
    "as @xmath17 , the potential is dominated by the bulge , i.e.  @xmath295 while the bulge @xmath296constant , so @xmath297 , giving @xmath298 for a disk formed by collapse at fixed baryon fraction and spin parameter @xmath50 , @xmath299 and the quantity @xmath300 is constant across disks , where we take @xmath301 and @xmath302kpc for the milky way in normalizing this ; i.e.  essentially a baryon fraction @xmath303 and spin parameter @xmath304 for @xmath305 .",
    "note that for this @xmath306 , calculating the gas density with @xmath307 at @xmath308kpc ( including the scaling of circular velocity , scale height , and surface density to this radius ) gives the standard @xmath309 for the local ism .    for a standard cloud density @xmath310 ,",
    "this then gives for the volume filling fraction at the center of the disk @xmath311 where @xmath312 is approximately constant .",
    "the characteristic timescale for a collision with a molecular cloud is then @xmath313 and the factors of @xmath280 cancel ( as a higher @xmath280 will increase the speed of clouds and thus number of collisions , but also `` puff up '' the disk and reduce the density of cold clouds ) .",
    "in addition to producing an appropriate eddington ratio distribution , there is observational support for stochastic cloud collisions with agn on such a timescale , as e.g.  dust clouds in the central regions of nearly low - luminosity agn appear to trace accretion events with a similar frequency @xcite .",
    "the expected spectrum of cloud sizes is @xmath314 so that the filling factor for clouds in some interval of @xmath84 goes as @xmath315 , and there are equal contributions to @xmath282 from each logarithmic interval in cloud size from the smallest @xmath316pc to the largest @xmath317pc .",
    "therefore , a more complete calculation of @xmath284 considering the probability of collision with clouds in each size interval gives only a logarithmic @xmath318 correction to the rate at which clouds collide with the black hole and ultimate the `` duty cycle '' of activity .",
    "we subsume this factor into @xmath319 , as it is within the present uncertainties",
    ". however , this range of cloud masses can be important for e.g.  the scatter in the expected @xmath1 relation from events fueled in this fashion .    finally ,",
    "the mass of a cloud needed for an accretion `` event '' is quite modest ( see   [ sec : mass.blowout ] ) , as low as @xmath320 , and the ultimate duty cycle derived in   [ sec : duty ] is effectively independent of the mass of cold gas inflow .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the @xmath14 of cold molecular gas typically concentrated within the central regions of late - type galaxies @xcite needs to pass randomly near the black hole , and from our derivation above events are expected only of order once per hubble time . with these considerations , there is no `` angular momentum problem , '' at least on the scales of interest .    unlike bright quasars , which require large gravitational torques to sustain high accretion rates @xmath321 for @xmath322yr with large @xmath323 masses , no disturbance to the galactic gas , even in the central disk ,",
    "is required for these quiescent seyferts .",
    "of course , processes such as such as disk and bar instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) may nevertheless play a role , and it is still of interest to understand in detail the transport of material from scales of order tens of pc considered here to the small @xmath13au sizes of an accretion disk , but these processes , at least on the large scales we consider here , will ultimately serve to increase the effective random ( non - rotational ) velocity dispersion of clouds .",
    "there are however two limits in which this activity will be suppressed , i.e.  @xmath284 can be become much larger than a hubble time .",
    "the first , in which @xmath324 and there is simply no gas supply to fuel this mode of accretion , is straightforward .",
    "the second , in which @xmath325 , implies that the central gas in the agn is not dynamically hot ",
    "i.e.  it has relatively little disordered motion and there is no disturbance which can bring gas to the black hole .",
    "such systems will also have very small black holes , given the @xmath1 relation , so their contribution to the observed seyfert luminosity function ( which we discuss in  [ sec : morph.contrib ] ) will be small .",
    "when colliding with a molecular cloud , a black hole on the @xmath1 relation will immediately enter the `` blowout '' phase .",
    "even if the black hole is slightly undermassive and accretes before entering this phase , this time is short compared to the eventual time at low or moderate accretion rates ( see the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : m.sigma.slope ] and [ sec : low.m.timescale ] ) , and the distribution of duty cycles can be well approximated by neglecting these times . in   [ sec : cloud.timescale ] we determined that the light curve in such an event is given by @xmath255 ( equation  [ [ eqn : mdot.pwrlaw ] ] ) , where @xmath326 is given in equation  ( [ eqn : tmdot.calc ] ) .",
    "this yields a differential time per logarithmic interval in luminosity , @xmath327 , given in equation  ( [ eqn : lifetime ] ) .",
    "the effective `` duty cycle '' for an object as a function of the accretion rate @xmath268 is then @xmath328 using our solutions for @xmath284 (   [ sec : rates ] ) and @xmath188 (   [ sec : cloud.timescale ] ) , we obtain @xmath329 where @xmath260 is defined in equation  ( [ eqn : tmdot.calc ] ) .    in general , @xmath330 , so we can easily infer some important properties of the duty cycle .",
    "first , this implies a duty cycle at large accretion rates @xmath250 of @xmath215 , similar to that estimated observationally from e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the duty cycle becomes large at lower accretion rates , going to @xmath15 at @xmath331 , again similar to that measured observationally from e.g.  @xcite who find a large fraction of late - type galaxies hosting moderate / low accretion rate seyferts .",
    "note , however , that technically these are theoretical upper limits to the duty cycles , for if accretion proceeds intermittently ( i.e.   in short , potentially super - eddington `` bursts '' ) the same average accretion rate on the timescales relevant for our calculations is maintained , although the timescale for such bursts is still constrained by the observed episodic quasar lifetime ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this also implies an effective minimum accretion rate @xmath332 , at which the total time spent with @xmath333 is equal to @xmath284 .",
    "this is not to say that this is a hard minimum to the seyfert accretion rate , but rather that by the long timescales expected for decay to accretion rates much below this , a subsequent collision with a molecular cloud is expected , which will `` reset '' the system to a high accretion rate . in detail , for @xmath334 with poisson statistics for the excitation rates , an exponential cutoff is expected to introduce a term @xmath335 $ ] .",
    "because this is a rapid cutoff , we can temporarily approximate it as an absolute cutoff and determine @xmath332 as where the duty cycle @xmath336 .",
    "this gives @xmath337 which for @xmath338 gives @xmath339 .",
    "finally , note that the terms involving cloud sizes have completely canceled in this derivation .",
    "thus , while the cloud size may be important for e.g.  scatter in the @xmath1 relation ( see   [ sec : m.sigma ] ) , it does not enter into our ultimate calculation of the seyfert luminosity function and distribution of accretion rates .",
    "therefore , the considerable uncertainties in the properties of clouds at the centers of galaxies , and the `` typical '' giant cloud size related to seyfert activity ( and the immediate source of such clouds ) do not affect our calculations .",
    "rather it is the well - constrained quantities such as gas fraction and our theoretically determined @xmath100 which determine these predictions .      from the duty cycle as a function of accretion rate , we can determine the seyfert luminosity function implied by this mode of fueling .",
    "we assume the black hole mass remains roughly constant during the blowout ( see   [ sec : mass.blowout ] ) , giving @xmath340 with @xmath341 , and assume a constant @xmath342 , as expected for a standard @xcite thin disk .    to derive the expected seyfert luminosity function , then , we require the distribution of black hole masses and corresponding host galaxy properties , in particular their masses , gas fractions , and velocity dispersions .",

    "however , there are several sources of uncertainty at low luminosities .",
    "a detailed comparison of the seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 h@xmath74 , [ oii ] , and [ oiii ] luminosity functions in @xcite , including a comparison between different selection criteria from @xcite and @xcite , suggests that there may be significant contamination by star formation at these luminosities in h@xmath74 , resulting in a significantly higher estimate ( note that we compare with the stricter agn cut the authors adopt , although contamination is still possible )",
    ".    additionally , measurement errors and bin - to - bin variation are significant at these luminosities , @xmath374dex .",
    "moreover , the luminosity function must turn over strongly near these luminosities .",
    "although the seyfert number density implied by integrating the observed luminosity function over the observed range implies that approximately @xmath375 of galaxies host a seyfert in this luminosity interval ( an observation necessarily reproduced by our modeling since our predicted luminosity and mass functions agree with those observed ) , extrapolating this luminosity function only @xmath376 magnitudes fainter would imply that there are more seyferts than there are galaxies .",
    "finally , alternative fueling mechanisms such as stellar winds may become important at these lowest luminosities , a point discussed in   [ sec : winds ] .",
    "our analysis enables us to decompose the contributions to the agn luminosity function from different galaxy types . at the brightest end , above the break in the extrapolated quasar luminosity function ,",

    "furthermore , our prediction depends on the eddington ratio distribution of quiescent ellipticals , estimated from their accretion rate decay according to our blast wave model following mergers and simulations of merger - driven black hole growth @xcite , but once these low accretion rates are attained , other processes may dominate the gas inflows and accretion , and thus our estimate may not be appropriate for this end of the distribution .    in the lower - left panel of figure  [ fig : edd ] , we show our prediction ( solid line ) for the mean accretion rate as a function of luminosity , compared ( dashed line ) to the corresponding eddington ratio for a black hole of mass @xmath427 at each @xmath393 ( i.e. approximately a logarithmic slope of @xmath428 ) .",

    "while our estimates of the evolution of e.g.  gas fractions and late - type mass functions are uncertain , the similarity ( relative to the evolution in the quasar luminosity function ) of the expected evolution , no evolution , and maximal evolution cases means that unless an extreme model for late - type galaxy evolution were adopted ( at odds with the observations ) , there would be essentially no difference in the predicted evolution of this luminosity function .",
    "thus , these observational errors are not a significant source of theoretical uncertainty for the key conclusions from figure  [ fig : lf.z ] .    from the figure",

    "if the normalization at these luminosities is matched to the extrapolated faint end of the quasar luminosity function , then it implies an even smaller contribution from this activity at these redshifts .",
    "however , it is important to note that the faint end quasar luminosity function plotted here is extrapolated below the observations at the higher redshifts , and may be incomplete at the lowest @xmath442 luminosities , corresponding to or slightly below the faintest bins in even the deep luminosity functions of e.g.@xcite at low ( @xmath443 ) redshifts .    for local , @xmath0 agn , the contribution from stochastic cold gas accretion dominates the luminosity function up to @xmath444 , near the traditional division between seyfert and quasar activity ( see figure  [ fig : lf ] ) .",

    "this luminosity function does still represent a significant contribution to the faint end ( i.e.  below the `` break '' ) of the quasar luminosity function up to @xmath447 .",
    "however , by @xmath5 , the `` seyfert '' ( i.e.  our predicted ) contribution to the quasar luminosity function is only significant at about @xmath448 magnitudes ( i.e.  two orders of magnitude in luminosity ) below the break , and by @xmath429 only important about 7 magnitudes , or 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity , below the break .",
    "thus , at the epochs generally associated with `` quasar activity , '' the contribution from this accretion mechanism is negligible , even at luminosities far below the deepest observations .    that the quasar luminosity function evolves more rapidly than our prediction for the seyfert luminosity function indicates that different modes of fueling are likely responsible for the two populations .",
    "indeed , merger - induced quasar activity can account for the evolution in the quasar luminosity function , and merger rates of gas - rich galaxies evolve more rapidly than the mass function of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "note that at any time the number of gas - rich galaxies undergoing mergers is small , so a relatively large number of mergers providing the observed quasar activity does not demand strong evolution in the disk galaxy mass function .",
    "@xcite study the evolution of quasar , red galaxy , and merger luminosity functions and argue that a self - consistent mapping between the two implies that a significant fraction of the brightest quasar activity must result from mergers .",
    "we can use our predictions to determine the contribution of quiescent fueling to the buildup of the black hole mass density of the universe and cosmological backgrounds , such as the cosmic x - ray background . from the analysis in   [ sec : m.sigma ] or the mean eddington ratio plotted as a function of @xmath2 in figure  [ fig : edd ] , this process will contribute negligibly to the growth of black hole masses above @xmath449 .",
    "larger - mass black holes ( @xmath450 ) dominate the present black hole mass density @xcite , and thus the contribution of quiescent fueling to the total black hole mass density is negligible . even at relatively low @xmath451 , the quiescent mode of fueling will increase black holes masses by only up to a factor @xmath452 ( see   [ sec : mass.blowout ] ) .",

    "in our scenario , when a molecular cloud of mass @xmath455 encounters a black hole of mass @xmath2 , there will be a short period of high accretion . for a cloud moving at a speed @xmath456 ,",
    "the bondi accretion rate will be @xmath457 and accretion will be eddington - limited with @xmath236 .",
    "the accretion rate will drop rapidly once feedback energy unbinds the cloud and heats or expels the surrounding gas .",
    "if feedback impacts the gas energetically , then the `` blowout '' phase begins roughly when the coupled radiant energy is comparable to the cloud binding energy .",
    "the system will follow the `` blast wave '' solution if it accretes at @xmath458 for a time @xmath459 ( see   [ sec : cloud.timescale ] ) , and an energy sufficient to unbind the cloud ( i.e.  a fraction @xmath460 of the binding energy of the cloud ) couples to the gas in a shorter time . this timescale is less than or comparable to the dynamical time of the cloud @xmath461 and the cloud crossing time @xmath462 ( i.e.  timescale of interaction between the black hole and bulk of the cloud ) , so it does not matter which we use in our analysis .",
    "they are also @xmath463 , the salpeter time , so we are justified in assuming that the black hole mass is approximately constant and the accretion rate is @xmath464 over this interval .",
    "the blowout criterion then becomes @xmath465 where @xmath466 is the feedback coupling efficiency and @xmath467 is a numerical coefficient which depends on the bulge profile and gives the binding energy at @xmath18 as a function of the observed @xmath6 ( i.e.  line - of - sight averaged velocity dispersion within the effective radius ) . for a @xcite spheroid , @xmath468 , so this factor is significant .",
    "this then determines a minimum black hole mass for blowout of @xmath469 where @xmath260 is defined in equation  ( [ eqn : tmdot.calc ] ) .",
    "if the black hole is initially formed along with the bulge as is expected from models of the @xmath1 relation with @xmath470 , it may therefore have to grow by a non - negligible factor at small-@xmath6 before a blowout occurs , and this implies a slightly shallower @xmath471 relation at low masses with @xmath472 .",
    "the above derivation is similar to that of @xcite , except that the characteristic timescale of an event and total gas mass are set externally and depend differently on @xmath6 , from e.g.  the dynamical time and gas mass in a merger .",

    "the injected momentum is @xmath476 , and the criterion becomes @xmath477 which gives a minimum black hole mass @xmath478 where the more efficient coupling ( @xmath479 ) for momentum - driven feedback is adopted following @xcite , when the molecular gas is optically thick to the agn radiation , at least outside the dust sublimation radius .",

    "therefore , for sufficiently low values of @xmath100 , the accretion rate decays slowly enough that some mass gain is possible in the blowout .    however , the growth is still relatively small , a factor @xmath562 , and less for lower - mass disks .",
    "a full numerical calculation allowing for the increase in mass with low-@xmath100 changing the eddington luminosity as the accretion rate decays also gives a small correction of a factor @xmath562 to the duty cycle at the lowest luminosities .",
    "this is consistent with detailed simulations of x - ray driven winds , which suggest efficient wind driving for @xmath563 @xcite , implying ( given the large observed energetics of agn outflows ) that most of the energy of the system should be generated in this early phase .",

    "consider a cloud approaching the black hole at the time where the black hole is about @xmath564 from cloud center ( i.e.  first `` touching '' the cloud ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : obsc.diagram ] . since @xmath565 this indeed defines their `` initial '' interaction .",

    "the covering angle for this is @xmath588 this is similar to our derivation of the blowout criterion as a function of mass in ",

    "[ fig : obscuration ] , we show the predicted fraction of seyfert 2 s as a function of luminosity from the luminosity - dependent form of equation  ( [ eqn : obsc.frac ] ) . for comparison , we plot the estimated seyfert 2 fraction from observations as indicated , in the manner of figure  [ fig : lf ] .",
    "the predicted scaling agrees with the observed trend , and also defines a cutoff at @xmath589 , i.e.  @xmath590 to @xmath591 , above which the requirement for obscuration is @xmath592 ; i.e.the black hole is sufficiently luminous to destroy the entire cloud regardless of angle .",
    "there are , however , two detailed effects which will smooth this cutoff .",
    "first , the pure luminosity form of equation  ( [ eqn : obsc.frac ] ) , while giving the appropriate scaling , is not strictly appropriate since the blowout in a given direction may not depend on the _ instantaneous _ seyfert luminosity , which may have decayed to quite low luminosities at later times , but on the momentum injected in the initial , high - luminosity `` blowout '' phase .",
    "this is given by re - considering equation  ( [ eqn : obsc.frac ] ) , as a function of black hole mass , with @xmath236 for a period @xmath188 as determined in ",
    "[ sec : cloud.timescale ] ( technically we integrate from @xmath236 to @xmath593 , since we define a differential time per logarithmic interval in accretion rate ) .",
    "this then provides a more precise estimate of the fraction which will have been `` blown out '' by the blast wave .",
    "accounting for this yields the dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : obscuration ] . at a given luminosity",
    ", there is a distribution of black hole masses at various accretion rates , and this effect smooths the obscured fraction as a function of luminosity .",
    "however , this still defines a characteristic @xmath594 above which the blowout will completely disrupt the cloud , with a corresponding eddington luminosity @xmath595 .",
    "the second effect is the spectrum of cloud sizes .",
    "a more or less massive cloud also implies a correspondingly smaller or larger covering angle of material which can not be expelled .",
    "we use the spectrum of cloud sizes in   [ sec : m.sigma.scatter ] to calculate the dispersion in the @xmath1 relation expected from this mode of accretion , and an identical calculation gives the dispersion in @xmath455 and correspondingly , via equation  ( [ eqn : obsc.frac ] ) , the variation in obscured fractions as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "averaging over this distribution yields the total obscured fraction as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath596 , shown as the solid black line in figure  [ fig : obscuration ] .",
    "these more detailed effects produce significant differences at intermediate masses , where the transition between obscured and unobscured populations is smoothed out .",
    "the agreement with the observations is improved , suggesting that this momentum balance argument provides a plausible estimate of the obscured fraction as a function of luminosity .",
    "note also that our argument does not necessarily depend on the black hole luminosity affecting _ directly _ the surrounding medium via radiation pressure or other momentum couplings .",
    "rather , because the blast wave impacting the medium will be pressure - driven , @xmath466 as used above represents an effective efficiency of the seyfert energy and momentum `` ending up '' in the initially driven blast wave by the time it impacts on the surrounding medium .",
    "our prediction is qualitatively similar to those of various modified `` luminosity - dependent '' torus models , and the fundamental qualitative point , that black hole feedback which is stronger in higher - luminosity systems is able to clear a larger opening angle , still obtains .",
    "however , our result is distinct from some of these models in several respects .",
    "for example , the `` receding torus '' model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assumes that the opening angle increases as the inner torus radius increases , owing to a larger dust sublimation radius @xmath597 with increasing dissociating luminosity .",
    "however , while this gives a reasonable scaling of the obscured fraction for a geometrically flat ( i.e.  rectangular torus cross - section ) torus , it is clear from figure  [ fig : obsc.diagram ] that for an increasing torus radius with @xmath20 ( i.e.  a circular torus cross - section or elliptical / spherical cloud , and conical opening angle models ) , removing a spherical region around the origin at the black hole has almost no effect on the covering angle of the cloud .",
    "this is true until @xmath598 ( for example , even at @xmath599 , for a spherical cloud or circular torus cross section , this only decreases the type 2 fraction by a factor of two from @xmath600 ) . in other words ,",
    "the dust sublimation radius would have to reach @xmath601pc before this mechanism would explain a scaling of obscured fraction with luminosity in this fueling scenario , into ( or even beyond ) the traditional narrow line regions .",
    "qualitatively , our mechanism is more similar to the disk - wind model of @xcite , in which radiation pressure flattens the initially vertical outflow and dust distribution in objects with higher bolometric luminosities .",
    "however , it can operate on much larger scales and depends on momentum balance from the blast wave ( not necessarily direct radiation pressure ) ejecting material within some opening angle , rather than merely flattening the distribution .",
    "it is also worth noting the striking similarity of the obscured fraction calculated from equations  ( [ eqn : obsc.frac ] ) and ( [ eqn : f.obsc ] ) and the functional form of empirical calculations which allow for e.g.  evolution of the inner torus radius and torus height as a function of luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that feedback balance does capture the critical dependence on black hole and fueling properties .    for comparison , the fitted type 2 fraction as a function of luminosity in higher - redshift quasars from @xcite , determined from the sdss and from @xcite ,",
    "is shown as the cyan line in figure  [ fig : obscuration ] .",
    "while a similar qualitative trend is apparent , the type 2 fraction is much higher , completely dominating at low - luminosities and contributing a substantial @xmath602 portion of the population even at @xmath603 , whereas in the local samples the type 2 fraction is at most comparable to the type 1 fraction at low luminosities and negligible ( @xmath604 ) at high luminosities .",
    "the cause of this difference is suggested by figure  [ fig : lf.z ] , in which the seyfert ( i.e.  quiescent , cold gas driven ) and quasar ( i.e.merger-driven ) luminosity functions are each plotted at several redshifts . even by @xmath605 , the quasar population is larger at these luminosities , and",
    "indeed the @xcite sample is drawn from surveys which are dominated by quasars at high redshifts spanning the wide range @xmath606 .",
    "these objects , in our modeling , are triggered by different processes , and therefore should not necessarily follow the same trend  indeed , the discrepancy between the two observations cautions against extrapolation of obscuration models ( e.g.  geometrical models ) calibrated for local , non - interacting populations . in @xcite",
    "we discuss this obscuration in a merger - driven context in detail , and show that the trends of @xcite can be reproduced when the primary source of obscuration is produced by larger scale ( @xmath607pc ) gas inflows from the mergers which themselves power accretion , and the distribution of column densities derives primarily from time - dependent rather than line - of - sight dependent differences .",
    "a similar qualitative trend is found because bright systems are more likely to be near their peak luminosity , when they are able to expel obscuring gas and dust , which is similar in principle to the model we have described here for obscuration of cloud - fueled agn .",
    "however , in our model for non - interacting seyferts , the obscuration is removed along certain sightlines at the beginning , not at the end of black hole growth , and the distribution of @xmath608 does , presumably , derive from geometric effects , as in canonical torus or disk - wind models .",
    "although it is not a requirement of this model , our picture for agn fueling can both derive from and seed the traditional molecular torus of standard agn unification models . assuming that a significant fraction of an accreted cloud is captured on passage near the black hole , essentially requiring @xmath609 , or @xmath610 ( ensured for the black hole masses of interest and for the predicted @xmath1 relation for this fueling mechanism , see ",
    "[ sec : m.sigma ] ) , then it will presumably develop an orbit , circularize , and some fraction of the cloud will be tidally disrupted .",
    "given an initial impact parameter @xmath611 and velocity @xmath280 , the material can settle into a keplerian orbit determined by conservation of angular momentum .",
    "for the bulk of the cloud , @xmath612 , so the circular velocity is determined by the spheroid potential , @xmath613 where @xmath91 is the bulge scale - length .",
    "using @xmath614 from   [ sec : merger.timescale ] with the appropriate factor of @xmath467 to convert from observed @xmath6 to a physical @xmath294 and @xmath91 assuming a hernquist ( 1990 ) spheroid profile yields @xmath615 .",
    "since this will include most of the mass , demanding the final angular momentum @xmath616 ( in detail @xmath617 for a torus with @xmath618 ) conserve the initial @xmath619 ( again , in detail @xmath620 for the geometry in   [ sec : obscuration ] ) yields a torus radius @xmath621 independent of @xmath6 , and assuming @xmath622 as we show below .",
    "thus the characteristic torus size @xmath623 s of pc ( up to a maximum @xmath624pc ) inferred from a wide variety of observations @xcite and simulations of torus structure and stability with radiative transfer models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a natural consequence of the scales of molecular clouds , and is `` built into '' this picture of seyfert fueling .    given this radius , whether the molecular cloud is circularized into a strict torus with volume @xmath625 ( assuming @xmath622 ) or remains spherical / ellipsoidal , the change in e.g.  density and other gas properties is well - defined ( varying by e.g.  @xmath375 using the exact solutions above and assuming it goes from a sphere to a torus ) .",
    "therefore , the characteristic density is also given by that of the original cloud , enhanced by the compression expected from equation  ( [ eqn : torus.size ] ) above , explaining the molecular and dust densities and masses inferred for molecular torii around seyferts , with @xmath626 .",
    "this gives a line - of - sight column density through the torus plane of @xmath627 this is similar to the column densities of torii inferred from phenomenological fits to the complete hard x - ray column density distributions of seyferts @xcite and from synthesis models fitted to the x - ray background @xcite .",
    "we can also calculate the expected height or flattening of this torus , as a function of radius and seyfert properties .",
    "if the molecular cloud , with density @xmath240 collapses from the ism with mean density @xmath628 , and magnetic flux ( @xmath629 ) is conserved , the magnetic field will be enhanced by @xmath630 . for typical magnetic fields providing pressure support in molecular clouds @xmath631 with @xmath632 and @xmath633 . for a diffuse ism",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because capture and circularization does not completely erase the properties of the molecular cloud , the magnetic fields on cloud scales can be preserved , continuing to provide pressure support .",
    "this pressure defines an effective sound speed @xmath639 , which for the above is @xmath640 .",
    "note that any other source of a similar pressure which is non - thermal ( i.e.  does not scale adiabatically ) , such as e.g.  turbulent motions , will have a similar effect . since this dominates the pressure support of the torus , and using the circular velocity at @xmath641 (",
    "i.e.  dominated by the spheroid potential ) the scale height is @xmath642 with a maximum of @xmath643 .",
    "thus , the torus is not expected to be strongly compressed , at the outer radii , with @xmath644 , again similar to traditional phenomenological models and observational estimates of the torus structure and covering angle @xcite .",
    "the timescale for all of this to occur will be of order the orbital timescale , @xmath645 , or @xmath646 for the bulk of the cloud at @xmath647 .",
    "thus , if the cloud is captured , it will begin to reach an equilibrium in the blast wave and orbit with the circular velocity in roughly a crossing time .",
    "it is therefore expected that it will be seen as such over the majority of the seyfert lifetime .",
    "there is a period of time @xmath648yr , comparable to the timescale at highest accretion rates @xmath649 , during which the system may be settling into equilibrium .",
    "we have shown the transition from cloud to torus implies little change in the cloud properties , so observational signatures of this transition phase , if it occurs , may not be obvious .",
    "given the effects of the black hole feedback we have modeled , and the fact that the blast wave can propagate to large ( @xmath650kpc ) scales on reasonable ( @xmath650gyr ) timescales , in principle there could be a significant impact on the host galaxy ism or gas structure . the black hole feedback expected from growth in mergers can sweep a large fraction of the remaining gas in the galaxy into an unbound blast wave , heating the remaining gas to the virial temperature and terminating star formation @xcite . however , the case of fueling by molecular cloud accretion is quite different , and we find that the blast wave is much weaker than required to significantly impact the host galaxy .    if the blowout is defined by the criterion that @xmath455 be accelerated to @xmath651 ( i.e.  that the local gas be unbound ) , then because @xmath652 , a collision between the blast wave and the ism will at most accelerate the ism to @xmath653 , if momentum considerations are most important . for typical galactic scales",
    "this gives a bulk speed @xmath654 , which is completely negligible on the scales of the ism . even under the extreme assumption that all the blast wave energy can be converted into bulk motion gives a velocity @xmath655 .",
    "thus , the blast wave itself is not expected to significantly impact the host galaxy ism .    if , instead of the momentum or energy in the blast wave shell , we make an even more extreme assumption that all of the feedback energy or momentum flux from black hole growth impacts the galaxy ism , the energy input could be much larger .",
    "we further make the maximal assumptions that @xmath100 is small , so the black hole grows substantially ( by a factor @xmath656 , see   [ sec : mass.blowout ] ) , and that the affected ism is unable to radiate .",
    "let us also consider the case of direct energy coupling ( i.e.  conversion of all feedback energy into bulk motion ) , which gives an increased impact of feedback by a factor @xmath657 over e.g.momentum-based coupling .",

    "following @xcite , we also estimate the total stellar mass loss within the black hole radius of influence .",
    "winds within this radius will be captured by the black hole , and be available for accretion .",

    "typical slow wind speeds @xmath683 , however , this is at most comparable to typical ellipticals @xmath684 , making this a relatively small source of uncertainty .",

    "a priori_. by no means does this model attempt to describe the small - scale gas thermal and ionization structure around the black hole .",
    "the local phenomena around the central engine , such as disk processes , the detailed coupling of feedback mechanisms , ionization , broad and narrow - line region evolution , and pc - scale molecular torii , which have been ( and continue to be ) studied in detail both theoretically and observationally ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , are obviously crucial to understanding agn activity but are outside the scope of the large - scale fueling and feedback mechanisms .",
    "ultimately , as long as feedback regulates agn activity in a rapid , explosive manner , which we have shown for the case of cold gas accretion in quiescent systems requires only a small fraction ( @xmath737 ) of the accretion energy to couple to the surrounding medium , the large scale evolution of fueling and accretion rates should be described by our model .",
    "however , our work emphasizes the need to understand the connection between these small - scale phenomena , which are presumably universal in agn unification models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and large - scale models for fueling and feedback in both quiescent systems as presented here or in interacting systems as in @xcite .",
    "although care must be taken in extrapolating properties of local quiescent objects to interacting systems , the broad agreement between the predictions of feedback - driven blowout in both cases suggests that feedback coupling may be quite similar in both . our model for feedback",
    "driven `` blowout '' and evolution of the seyfert light curve grafts naturally onto disk - wind models in which the broad and narrow line regions are part of a high - velocity magnetically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , advectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or radiatively @xcite driven outflow from the accretion disk , which immediately suggest mechanisms for the coupling of feedback to the surrounding medium and a mapping from local scales ( i.e.  the accretion disk region from which the wind is driven ) to large scales .",
    "such a wind could directly drive an outflow , with mass pile - up in a `` snowplow '' phase and the ( initially radiatively , energetically coupled outflow ) powering a momentum - driven wind .",
    "alternatively , it could collide with gas on cloud or central cold gas disk scales and shock , giving a pressure and energy source which drives a pressure - driven sedov - type explosion .",
    "it is suggestive that these mechanisms manifest similarly , but there remain many alternative possibilities for the coupling of feedback . studying this in the `` laboratory '' of local seyferts , where agn - driven winds are well - known and studied in detail ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , may potentially represent the ultimate mapping between the well - studied properties of agn on small scales and the large - scale implications for the host galaxy and agn statistics as studied here .",

    "<S> using a simple description of feedback from black hole growth , we develop an analytic model for the fueling of seyferts ( low - luminosity agn ) and their relation to their host galaxies , eddington ratio distributions , and cosmological evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a solution for the time evolution of accretion rates in a feedback - driven blast wave , applicable to large - scale outflows from bright quasars in galaxy mergers , low - luminosity agn , and black holes or neutron stars in supernova remnants . under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central supermassive black hole at a rate set by the dynamics of that gas </S>",
    "<S> , our solution determines the evolution of seyfert light curves . using this model </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the seyfert luminosity function , duty cycles and agn `` lifetimes , '' and the distribution of host morphologies , eddington ratios , and obscuration as a function of agn luminosity and black hole mass , and find agreement with observations at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the breakdown of the contribution from this mechanism and from stellar wind and virialized hot gas accretion and merger - driven activity . </S>",
    "<S> we also make specific predictions for the weak evolution of the seyfert luminosity function ; i.e.  luminosity function of quiescent , as opposed to merger - driven activity , as a function of redshift , and for changes in both the slope and scatter of the @xmath1 relation at low-@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling provides a quantitative and physical distinction between local , low - luminosity quiescent agn activity and violent , merger - driven bright quasars . in our picture , the quiescent mode of fueling dominates over a wide range of luminosities ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath0 , where most black hole growth occurs in objects with @xmath4 , in s0 and sa / b galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , quasar activity from gas - rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift , and by @xmath5 , quiescent fueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more below the `` break '' in the luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , although non - merger driven fueling is important for black hole growth and the @xmath1 relation at low @xmath2 , it does not significantly contribute to the black hole mass density of the universe or to cosmological backgrounds . </S>"
