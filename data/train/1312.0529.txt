    "the electronic band structure and the related exciton - polariton transitions in wurtzite semiconductors were investigated in countless experimental and theoretical studies over the past five to six decades . indeed for zno important contributions in the field were already published in the early 1960s @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , fundamental properties such as the ordering of the valence bands ( vbs ) and the influence of stress on the exciton - polariton transitions remain controversial to the present day .",
    "magnetic fields and external pressure constitute powerful tools to obtain detailed information about electronic band structures and optical transitions by studying the exciton - polariton fine structure .",
    "in addition , in recent years , significant advances in computational power and theoretical algorithms have enabled electronic - structure calculations , including quasiparticle ( qp ) effects and electron - hole interaction which reproduce experimental results to a high degree of precision .",
    "consequently , it is now possible to conduct complex calculations taking into account , for instance , the influence of stress on the electronic band structure and the exciton - polariton transitions in direct comparison to experimental results .",
    "the long - standing disagreement of the valence band ordering in zno is one important example for the necessity to comprehend the effects of built - in strain and external stress on the electronic band structure and optical transitions in detail .",
    "recent magneto - optical measurements of free and bound excitons provide strong evidence that the topmost a valence band has @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "these results are in accordance with _ first - principles _ qp band - structure calculations @xcite as well as a multitude of earlier theoretical and experimental works supporting the valence band ordering originally proposed by thomas in 1960.@xcite by contrast , several publications exist which postulate @xmath3 symmetry for the a valence band ( for a summary of the relevant literature see e.g.  refs .   and ) .",
    "while some of the conflicting results have been resolved@xcite , the important question remains if the presence of strain ( or the application of external stress ) that preserves the wurtzite structure of zno ( i.e.  uniaxial pressure along the @xmath4 axis , biaxial stress perpendicular to the @xmath4 axis , and hydrostatic pressure ) may result in a reversal of the valence band ordering and thus could explain the different assignments in the literature .",
    "such a reversal of the a and b vb symmetry as function of strain was discussed e.g.  for the wurtzite iii - v semiconductors gan  @xcite and aln@xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite first predicted a crossing of the upper two vbs in gan for biaxial in - plane strain .",
    "this prediction was supported by shikanai _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and more recently by fu _ _ et al.__@xcite who reported a reversal of the vb ordering for uniaxial strain values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and fu _ _ et al.__@xcite calculated an exchange of the upper two vb characteristics in aln for uniaxial strain values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .    in the case of zno , gil _",
    "et al . _ suggested a reversal of the a and b valence band ordering for a biaxial compressive stress of @xmath9  kbar which corresponds to a uniaxial part of the strain tensor of @xmath10 and thus concluded that the vb ordering in zno is quite sensitive to strain.@xcite however , the authors had to rely on exciton energies reported in the literature which included only one work by butkhuzi _ _ et al.__@xcite with sufficiently shifted free exciton energies to suggest a large in - plain strain and a strain - related reversal of the vb ordering",
    ". a closer look into this work reveals several major problems which render the reported transition energies in ref .",
    "questionable for a strain analysis : ( i ) the luminescence spectra were acquired at 77  k instead of 4  k resulting in a shift of the transition energies in accordance with the temperature dependence of the band gap  @xcite , ( ii ) the luminescence was excited by a pulsed nitrogen laser with high pulse energy leading to an excitation density related shift of the observed exciton lines@xcite , and ( iii ) an inaccurate proportionality factor was used to convert the wavelength values ( nm ) into energy ( ev ) resulting in energy values which are too small by about 2.5  mev .",
    "the combination of these effects leads to significant deviations of the exciton energies and consequently results in misleading strain values and conclusions in the experimental part of ref .",
    "this situation provides a strong motivation to revisit the stress dependence of the valence band ordering in zno in detail .",
    "the large research interest in this field is also reflected by several most recent publications about the strain dependence of the electronics bands in related materials.@xcite    apart from the influence of stress and strain on the vb ordering , important elastic and electronic parameters such as the phonon- and exciton deformation potentials ( dp ) can be derived by e.g.  raman and luminescence studies as function of applied pressure .",
    "hydrostatic pressure was widely used to study the phase transition from the wurtzite to the rocksalt structure@xcite as well as a variety of phonon related parameters such as the grneisen parameters and the pressure dependence of the born effective charge.@xcite in addition , the phonon deformation potentials were determined by raman spectroscopy as function of uniaxial pressure.@xcite however , only few sources are available for the electronic deformation potentials . for gan and aln these",
    "were recently studied using reflectance spectroscopy under uniaxial stress by ishii et al.@xcite in the case of zno , experimental studies and theoretical calculations were published without including the effects of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "the effects of uniaxial pressure were experimentally studied in great detail by wrzesinski and frhlich using two - photon and three - photon spectroscopy but the spin - orbit splitting and the contributions of exchange interaction were not resolved and discussed separately.@xcite    in order to remedy this situation , we investigate in this work the effects of stress on the band structure and exciton - polariton energies in wurtzite zno both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "we perform a detailed theoretical analysis of the effects of external uniaxial stress , biaxial stress , and hydrostatic pressure on the a - b and a - c exciton - polariton splittings , the exchange splitting , and the longitudinal - transversal ( lt ) splitting using the quasi - cubic approximation and taking the interaction between all exciton states into account.@xcite from the results of _ first - principles _ calculations based on the hse+@xmath0 method ( see section [ abinitio ] ) , we compute the deformation potentials that describe all effects of external stress which preserve the wurtzite symmetry of zno .",
    "the full set of the dp constants includes those describing the spin - dependent part ( allowing for the anisotropy of the spin - orbit interaction ) as well as the kinetic - energy part of the effective hamiltonian in the quasi - cubic approximation .",
    "special attention is paid to the effects of stress on the spin - orbit interaction constant and its anisotropy .",
    "the results of these considerations are compared with uniaxial stress - dependent photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements for zno substrates from different manufacturers as well as reported data in the literature .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after the description of the theoretical and experimental techniques in sections  [ abinitio ] and [ setup ] , we first present the results of the _ ab - initio _ calculations for the electronic bands as function of pure uniaxial and biaxial stress and their combination ( section  [ stress ] ) .",
    "the excitonic deformation potentials including the stress dependence of the spin - orbit interaction are discussed in section  [ defpot ] .",
    "the theoretical considerations are complemented by measurements of the exciton polariton energies as function of uniaxial stress ( section  [ results ] ) .",
    "finally , the experimentally resolved exciton - polariton fine structure is used to investigate the effects of stress on the exchange interaction in section  [ pol ] and the results are summarized in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in order to compute energies of electronic states that can be compared to experimental results , it is important to account for single - particle effects which are computed by solving a qp equation that properly accounts for the electronic self energy @xmath11 .",
    "nowadays , hedin s @xmath12 approximation @xcite of @xmath11 is the state - of - the - art approach @xcite . due to the high computational cost of a self - consistent solution of the qp equation ,",
    "first - order perturbation theory is used to obtain qp energies by correcting an initial electronic structure @xcite .",
    "this so - called @xmath0 approach requires an initial electronic structure not too far from the final results .",
    "we rely on solving a generalized kohn - sham equation @xcite , since for zno it has been shown before that the nonlocal hse hybrid functional@xcite using a parameter of @xmath13 a.u.@xmath14 ( see ref .   for details ) provides an excellent starting point for @xmath0 calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the present work the influence of the spin - orbit interaction on electronic states of strained zno is investigated .",
    "earlier studies @xcite indicate that the soc only slightly modifies the kohn - sham states of zno ; the impact on the screened coulomb potential @xmath15 is expected to be small .",
    "therefore , the influence of the spin - orbit interaction on the qp _ corrections _ is neglected here .",
    "qp energies that account for the soc - related effects are calculated by adding qp shifts calculated without soc to hse eigenvalues that include spin - orbit - interaction effects @xcite .",
    "this approach is expected to produce reasonable results because the absolute spin - orbit - induced shifts are small compared to the qp corrections for zno .",
    "the qp electronic structures ( including soc ) of the uniaxially and biaxially strained cells are calculated using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath16 and o@xmath17 electrons as well as the zn@xmath18 and zn@xmath19 states are treated as valence electrons .",
    "the projector - augmented wave method is applied to describe the wave functions in the core regions @xcite .",

    "were used in this work .",
    "we are aware that this method slightly underestimates the fundamental gaps , however , it is well suited for the description of the strain dependence of the qp electronic structure .",

    "the luminescence of the samples is excited by the 325  nm line of a hecd laser with an excitation power of 20  mw and detected using a bi - alkali photomultiplier attached to a spex 1  m double monochromator with a spectral resolution of 50  @xmath24ev .",
    "uniaxial pressure measurements were performed in a self - built pressure apparatus ( fig .",
    "[ uniaxial - apparatus ] ) which is placed inside a helium bath cryostat with a temperature of 4  k. the pressure on the samples was applied via a stainless - steel piston using a pneumatic construction . the primary gas pressure in the pressure transmitting chamber on top of the piston was fine tuned by a two stage pressure regulator with an error of 5  mbar .",
    "the pressure in this chamber was used to push the piston downwards against a hardened steel hemisphere in between which the sample was placed .",

    "the following subsections briefly explain the procedure for these three cases .",
    "pure uniaxial stress @xmath35 is defined by vanishing forces in the plane and constant forces along the @xmath4 axis ( @xmath36 axis ) whereas pure biaxial stress @xmath37 is defined by constant forces in the plane and vanishing forces along the @xmath4 axis : @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath35 ( @xmath37 ) being positive in the case of uniaxial ( biaxial ) compression along the @xmath36 axis ( in the plane ) and negative otherwise .",

    "from this set of equations we can calculate all eight unknown variables .",
    "these are the zero stress exciton energies @xmath86 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , the exchange and dipole interaction parameters @xmath89 , @xmath173 , @xmath172 , and the wave function parameter @xmath44 . the resulting values are listed in table [ tzeroparameter ] . for comparison",
    ", we have also calculated these parameters using the exciton - polariton energies reported by wrzesinski _",
    "_ @xcite and fiebig _ _ et al.__@xcite ( cf .",
    "table [ tzeroparameter ] ) .",
    "one can see that the resulting energies and parameters are in very good agreement which justifies the described approach .    in the next step ,",
    "we use the zero stress energies and the experimentally determined uniaxial stress rates for the lines @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath63 , @xmath127 , @xmath64 , @xmath128 , and @xmath153 in order to compute the stress dependence of all output parameters by solving equations .",
    "the resulting stress rates are also listed in table [ tzeroparameter ] .",
    "it is important to note that the computed results for the @xmath86 line are very sensitive to the input parameters .",
    "thus , even small errors of the input stress rates or zero stress energies may result in about one order of magnitude larger errors for the position and stress rates of the @xmath86 line as compared to the input values .",
    "the stress rate for the @xmath86 line of 2.6 mev / gpa is found to be significantly smaller than the measured value of @xmath176 mev / gpa for the @xmath153 line .",
    "this large difference in the stress rates for @xmath153 and @xmath86 lines ( and thus the large stress rate for the lt splitting of the @xmath177 exciton of 10.9 mev / gpa ) is partly caused by the stress dependence of the dipole interaction energy @xmath165 of the @xmath177 exciton and partly due to the large stress rate for the energy splitting between a and c excitons .",
    "compared to the c excitons , the stress rate for the lt splitting of the @xmath178 excitons is significantly smaller because of the much weaker dipole interaction energy @xmath164 .",
    "nevertheless , the small difference in the stress rates of the @xmath117 and @xmath179 exciton lines can still be observed in fig .",
    "3 as a broadening of the @xmath178 exciton line with increasing uniaxial stress .    using the computed uniaxial stress rates @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and assuming the stress rates of the a , b , and c exciton binding energies to be equal ( 2.8 mev / gpa ) , we obtain the uniaxial rates @xmath167 for the energy splittings @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath111 , @xmath183 , and @xmath120 listed in the eights column of table [ eabc ] as experimentally determined rates . these shifting rates are in a very good agreement with our computed rates by _ ab - initio _ calculations ( sevenths column of table [ eabc ] ) .",
    "the procedure described above considerably improves the estimation for the a - c exciton splitting . indeed , using the rates for @xmath60 and @xmath62",
    ", we obtain a value of about @xmath184  mev / gpa for the @xmath120 splitting in good agreement with the theoretical result of @xmath185  mev / gpa .",
    "the remaining discrepancy could be caused e.g.  by the fact that we have assumed the same stress rate for the c exciton binding energy as experimentally determined for the a and b excitons as well as because of the still large uncertainty for the stress rate of the @xmath86 exciton line .",
    "we have presented a detailed theoretical and experimental study on the effects of stress on the band gap energies and the exciton - polariton fine structure in wurtzite zno .",
    "the theoretical approach combined _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for the qp energies as function of uniaxial and biaxial stress with the @xmath186 modeling of the band structure hamiltonian and the exciton - polariton splittings .",
    "these calculations were complemented by polarization dependent luminescence measurements of the exciton - polariton emission lines in different zno substrates as function of uniaxial stress . based on the joint experimental and theoretical approach , clear evidence is found that the ordering of the topmost a(@xmath2 ) and b(@xmath3 ) valence bands in zno remains unchanged even for large uniaxial and biaxial stress .",
    "the zero - stress energies and the strain and stress rates for the band gap energies , valence band splittings , crystal - field splitting , and anisotropic spin - orbit coupling are computed for uniaxial , biaxial , and hydrostatic pressure . while the crystal - field spitting is found to be highly sensitive to uniaxial and biaxial stress ,",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is almost unaffected by stress , thus explaining the stability of the symmetry ordering of the a and b valence bands in zno .",
    "in addition , the full set of symmetry preserving deformation potentials is determined including the spin - orbit interaction and its anisotropy .",
    "based on the combination of polarized luminescence measurements and @xmath186 modeling , the uniaxial stress rates are determined for the longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) splitting of the exciton polaritons ( including the lt splitting of the a(@xmath114 ) exciton - polariton ) and their excitonic binding energies . while the stress dependence of the lt splitting of the a and b exciton - polaritons",
    "is found to be small for uniaxial pressure , the lt splitting of the c exciton - polariton is significant which is explained by the large stress dependences of the dipole interaction energy and the crystal - field interaction . it is shown that only through the inclusion of the stress dependence of the exchange interaction and the lt splitting in the theoretical description , it is possible to achieve an accurate description of the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we also obtain the zero - stress energies and uniaxial stress rates for the dipole interaction and wave function parameters .",
    "in summary , the combination of theoretical and experimental techniques in this work proved that the valence band ordering in zno is unaffected by any realistic amount of strain due to e.g. lattice mismatch and different coefficients of thermal expansion in hetero - epitaxially grown layers or different impurity concentrations in bulk material .",
    "our results also provide a multitude of important electronic parameters including the spin - dependent deformation potentials as well as the energies and stress rates of the crystal - field interaction , spin - orbit coupling , exchange interaction , and exciton - polariton splittings .    the research presented here received funding from the european community s seventh framework program ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no .",
