    "this flux limit provides an additional constraint on the lens model . because there is some ambiguity in the non - detection of the third image flux ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have chosen not to treat this constraint in the standard fashion .",
    "we instead adopt a weighting function that assigns no penalty to a lens model if it predicts a third image flux below the @xmath84 detection limit , but where the penalty increases steeply if the predicted flux is greater than this limit .",

    "@xcite disputed the young _ et al . _",

    "we therefore hesitate to restrict ourselves to an isothermal homoeoid , as do kormann , schneider , & bartelmann ( 1994 ) in their unsuccessful attempt to model the gravitational lens producing the quadruple image b1422 + 231 .",

    "the only alternative that allows us to work with lens equations in closed form is to approximate the splh with a suitable elliptical potential model . as we show in  [ plummer ] , the tilted plummer family of elliptical potentials possesses the appropriate parameters to approximate the behavior of the splh .",

    "the elliptical g1 does not help the problematic @xmath167 , which still remains 1.8 standard deviations below the value observed by @xcite . comparing table [ realmodtab ] with table [ bestnobh ]",
    ", we see that adding ellipticity to the g1 density profile makes little change to the galaxy mass model parameters .",
    "in particular , the elliptical model best - fit core radius @xmath238  mas , einstein radius @xmath239 , and power - law exponent @xmath240 are all well within the @xmath163 confidence limits of the spls fitting .",
    "while the best - fit scaled shear remains exactly the same at @xmath241 , we find that the optimal shear position angle rotates substantially to @xmath242 .",
    "this value is far outside the @xmath163 bounds @xmath243 we obtain when fitting to the spls .",
    "these results are not entirely surprising , as we might expect the shift to an elliptical g1 to have the most impact upon the fitted external shear and position angle .",
    "just as @xmath5 compensates for the shear induced by the cluster , so too does it compensate for shear caused by the lensing galaxy and not adequately reproduced by a spls model . now introducing a separate ellipticity due to g1",
    ", we find that the external shear adjusts so as to model only the cluster shear , but to first order none of the g1 parameters are affected .",
    "of course , we have assumed that the mass ellipticity of g1 is the same as its isophotal ellipticity .",
    "if the mass is significantly more distorted , then we expect bigger changes .    despite the significant shift in external shear direction ,",
    "the best - fit elliptical g1 model gives a hubble parameter of @xmath244 .",
    "this is a deviation of less than two percent from the @xmath198 we obtained with the spls , and well within the @xmath163 spls confidence interval of @xmath245 .",
    "we therefore conclude that asphericity of the mass in g1 does not significantly alter the results we have obtained by fitting an spls , particularly with regard to the derived hubble constant .",
    "considering perturbations to the cluster model [ sisgalsec ] up to this point , all of our 0957 + 561 lens models have assumed that we may add to the potential of g1 a locally quadratic potential due to the cluster , characterized by fixed convergence , shear , and shear position angle . as we have seen in ",
    "[ ellsec ] , this `` external '' quadratic potential may also compensate for failings in our particular choice of the g1 mass distribution . even if we were to have chanced upon the perfect parameterization of the g1 potential , we may nonetheless obtain a poor match to the observations if there were too much `` clumpiness '' in the local cluster potential around g1 for our quadratic external potential to handle .",
    "this possibility is heightened by the large ( @xmath246 ) separation between the two images of 0957 + 561 .",
    "assuming for the moment that the cluster dark matter potential is locally quadratic about g1 , we may then ask if there are other galaxies sufficiently close to g1 that their differential lensing properties from image a to image b might cause problems .",

    "what effect these nearby galaxies might have on our results , we include them as singular isothermal spheres .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere is an attractive candidate not only because of its simple lensing properties , but also because of its relatively slow density falloff at large radii .",
    "this allows us to be conservative in estimating the perturbative effect of g20 and g21 on the lensing at g1 . to assign isothermal velocity dispersions @xmath15 to the galaxies",
    ", we use the faber - jackson relation @xmath258 ( faber & jackson 1976 ) .",

    "we point out that these einstein radii are small fractions of the galaxies distances from the 0957 + 561 images  less than 10% for g20 and less than 5% for g21 .",
    "we summarize in table [ realmodtab ] the results of our model - fitting with a perturbed cluster .",
    "the additional galaxies bring the reduced chi - square of the fit down to 3.4 , a significant improvement over the original spls and slightly superior to the splh .",
    "better fitting of the quasar image positions is responsible for almost all of the @xmath6 reduction , as is the case in our study of g1 ellipticity ( see  [ ellsec ] ) .",
    "similarly , we find little improvement in either the overall magnification @xmath6 or the persistent discrepancy between model - predicted and observed @xmath168 .",
    "the best - fit g1 einstein radius and cluster scaled shear are both down by @xmath262 .",
    "the reduction of the einstein radius is because the the two external galaxies contribute an effective mass density , or convergence @xmath4 , in the vicinity of the lensed images . as we have already discussed in ",
    "[ sheet ] , any external @xmath4 leads to a corresponding reduction in the mass of the primary galaxy g1 .",
    "the magnitude of the shear decreases partly for the same reason and partly because the external galaxies themselves produce some of the shear needed to explain the geometry of 0957 + 561 .",
    "the shear position angle rotates by a significant amount ( to @xmath263 ) , again indicating that the external galaxies have absorbed a fraction of the required shear .",
    "the g1 core radius and power - law index show no significant change , implying that these parameters are quite robust .",
    "the best - fit hubble parameter @xmath154 is 0.582 , a drop of some 4% from the 0.605 value obtained using the plain spls .",
    "this shift is compatible with the @xmath163 uncertainty we quoted for the spls model .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 goes down rather than up is easily explained by the fact that the two external galaxies have introduced an effective convergence into the model ( see  [ sheet ] ) . in conclusion",
    ", there are no qualitative surprises from these calculations .",
    "quantitatively , we find that the two nearest galaxies in the cluster have insignificant effect on our estimate of the hubble constant .    eliminating the cluster degeneracy [ getkappa ] the focus to this point has been to show how recent vlbi observations of the lensed images 0957 + 561a , b limit the range of possible lens mass models , thereby limiting the model - dependent uncertainty in the determination of @xmath12 using this system .",
    "quantitatively , the result is expressed in the bounds on the hubble parameter @xmath154 given in the previous section . in order to obtain @xmath12 , we see from equation [ [ h1.5eq ] ] that we need a measurement of the relative time delay @xmath13 and a determination of the cluster convergence @xmath4 .",
    "considerable work has gone into the former ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is only a matter of time before a precise ( @xmath264 ) value of @xmath13 will be settled upon for 0957 + 561 .",
    "constraining the cluster convergence is a more difficult problem . as described in ",
    "[ sheet ] , the factor @xmath132 in the @xmath12 equation [ [ h1.5eq ] ] can not be eliminated purely by observations of the lensed images . however , as falco _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) showed , it is possible to estimate this factor by measuring the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy .",
    "we apply this method in  [ veldi ] below .",
    "alternatively , a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the cluster may be used (  [ measclust ] ) .",
    "velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy g1 [ veldi ]    the falco _",

    "turning this around , a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy allows us to normalize the lens mass model and thereby constrain @xmath4 . because the mass of the galaxy scales linearly with the square of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath265 , we may rewrite equation [ [ h1.5eq ] ] as @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the expected velocity dispersion of the model lens galaxy in the limit that the surrounding cluster has zero convergence .",

    "kochanek ( 1993 ) addresses this issue and gives a corrected form of equation [ [ veleq ] ] taking into account finite - aperture effects .",
    "we have applied kochanek s method assuming that the velocity dispersion of the galaxy is measured with a long slit of angular width 1 .",
    "the second issue concerns the degree of isotropy of the stellar orbits . whereas equation [ [ veleq ] ] when integrated out to infinity is valid",
    "regardless of the shapes of the orbits , the predicted dispersion measured through a finite aperture varies with orbit anisotropy .",
    "kochanek ( 1993 ) has considered this issue as well and has presented results for a stellar system with a constant anisotropy factor , @xmath284 , relating radial and tangential velocity dispersions @xmath285 of orbits at any given radius : @xmath286    assuming isotropic @xmath287 orbits in g1 and a 1  slit aperture , we find that the best - fit spls model without compact nucleus ( table [ bestnobh ] ) predicts @xmath288 km s@xmath289 , with 95% confidence limits .",
    "we show in figure [ veldisp ] a map of the predicted velocity dispersion as a function of core radius and power - law exponent . from this plot",
    "we see that contours of constant @xmath290 are remarkably parallel to the contours of @xmath6 , so that @xmath290 varies by only @xmath291 over the range of allowed lens model parameters .",
    "a somewhat larger uncertainty is present if we allow for anisotropic orbits .",
    "figure [ trivel ] shows @xmath6 versus @xmath290 corresponding to three values of @xmath284 : @xmath292 , 0 , 0.2 .",
    "we find that the shape of the curve is virtually unchanged over this range of anisotropy , but the best - fit velocity scales approximately as @xmath293 .",
    "if we assume that the bright cluster elliptical g1 has @xmath294 , the fractional uncertainty in @xmath283 due to uncertainty in @xmath284 is no more than 6% .",
    "this is reassuring , as we expect the uncertainty in the measured dispersion to be at least this high .",
    "thus , we finally obtain the following result for the hubble constant : @xmath295 where we now have absorbed the model parameter uncertainty in @xmath283 into the error estimate on the coefficient . we have also included ( in quadrature ) the aforementioned 6% uncertainty due to the unknown g1 anisotropy @xmath284 . equation [",

    "the main difference is that our result refers to a specific galaxy whereas wallington & narayan and @xcite carried out a statistical analysis of the ensemble of lens galaxies .",
    "we are able to constrain the radial index @xmath2 of the lens model ( _ cf . _  eq .  [ [ density ] ] ) to within a 10% range .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath2 is close to the isothermal value , @xmath8 .",
    "however , exact isothermality seems to be ruled out and our model suggests that the density falls more slowly than @xmath309 at large radius . the tight constraint on @xmath2 plus the fact that the model makes use of images located as far as 5  from the galaxy center makes this a fairly significant result .",
    "the light from the lens galaxy fits a de vaucouleurs profile ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which falls off at large radii much more steeply than a mass - traces - light isothermal distribution .",
    "our lens model therefore indicates a substantial amount of dark matter out to at least @xmath310  kpc from the center of the lens .",
    "a similar result was obtained by kochanek ( 1995 ) for the lensing galaxy in the radio ring source mg1654 , but out to a somewhat smaller radius . using a different approach , but again based on gravitational lensing , brainerd , blandford , & smail ( 1995 ) found evidence for isothermal halos in galaxies extending over 100  kpc from the center .",
    "these studies illustrate the unique advantages of gravitational lensing for studying the mass distributions of distant galaxies .",
    "in addition to the spls model , we also test an fgs - like model of the lensing galaxy which consists of an approximate king potential ( with two parameters ) plus a compact central mass .",
    "the idea here is to repeat the analysis of fgs using our larger data set to better constrain the model .",
    "the best - fit fgs parameters are shown in table [ fgsparm ] , and turn out to be quite different from the values published by fgs . adding more data thus seems to have modified the model significantly , suggesting that the parameter values determined by fgs were not robust .",
    "one reason could be that fgs had only one degree of freedom in their fit .",
    "another noteworthy feature of the fgs model is that it requires an enormous central mass of @xmath311 .",
    "such a large mass is unlikely to be a nuclear black hole and it is not clear exactly what it represents . as a result of the large central mass , the fgs model also has a large core radius in excess of the 0957 + 561b separation from the galaxy center .",
    "one of the advantages of the spls model is that it does not require a central mass . nevertheless , in analogy with the fgs model",
    ", we try to see what would be the effect of adding a point mass to the spls model .",
    "the results are discussed in  [ splsbh ] and shown in table [ bestwbh ] . in brief",
    "we find that the reduced @xmath6 worsens by 1.2 when a central mass is added , which suggests that the data do not favor the inclusion of such a mass",
    ".    one troubling feature of our best - fit model is that the reduced @xmath6 is quite large , @xmath312 . perhaps our model , despite being more general than previous ones ,",
    "is still too simple to fit all the data . incorporating reasonable perturbations due to g1 ellipticity (  [ ellsec ] ) and nearby cluster galaxies (  [ sisgalsec ] ) results in modest @xmath164 improvement , but never do we obtain @xmath313 for any of our spls variants .",
    "efforts are under way to map the 0957 + 561 cluster mass distribution using weak distortions of background galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies should help to show whether an fgs - like quadratic potential is sufficient to account for the cluster lensing local to g1 .",
    "if our cluster model is adequate , and we simply have not hit upon the correct shape for g1 , we must look to alternate mass models for the lensing galaxy . to this end",
    ", we plan to explore more general mass - traces - light models , such as the following circularly - symmetric , four - parameter model proposed by tremaine ( 1995 ) : @xmath314^ { ( \\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath315 is the galaxy core radius .",
    "surface brightness profiles of many galaxies are fit by this functional form with @xmath316 ; @xmath317 ; and @xmath318 .",
    "the poor fit we find with the fgs model is also troubling . using the fgs model ,",
    "we obtain a best - fit @xmath319 , rather worse than the spls and much worse than the @xmath320 quoted by fgs in their earlier fit to lower - resolution data .",
    "we are surprised that neither the spls nor the fgs - type family of models can accommodate the recent vlbi data of @xcite .",
    "why is @xmath164 large for all models tested ?",
    "part of the reason seems to be that some of the data are measured with extraordinary precision , _",
    "e.g. _  the positions of the quasar jet emission blobs are known to 0.1  mas ( table [ impostab ] ) .",
    "the models are therefore penalized even for very small errors .",
    "in fact , had we adopted the falco _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) convention of 1  mas vlbi positioning of the g1 center of mass , both the spls and the fgs models would have been grossly inconsistent with the data (  [ errsubsec ] ) . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "having the galaxy center of mass coincident with the vlbi source provides a natural explanation that the radio emission originates in the core of this bright cluster elliptical .",
    "our current model has no explanation for this observed radio emission .",
    "another reason for the large @xmath164 of all our models is the large correlations quoted by @xcite among the elements of the 0957 + 561 relative magnification matrix and its gradient .",
    "these correlations ( table [ magtab ] ) cause even fairly good fits of the measurements ( table [ chitable ] ) to contribute large amounts to the overall @xmath6 .",
    "further vlbi observations of the jets in 0957 + 561 would be desirable both to confirm the present results and to improve the quality of the constraints .    in view of the large @xmath164 values",
    ", we have been conservative in setting confidence limits on the various parameter estimates (  [ splsnums ] )  we have taken the 95% limits to correspond with a @xmath6 increase of @xmath321 rather than 4 . despite this conservative approach ,",
    "the spls mass model parameters are well constrained . moreover ,",
    "when we perturb the fitting , either by giving the g1 mass distribution a modest ellipticity corresponding to the observed g1 isophotes (  [ ellsec ] ) or by including the nearest observed cluster members explicitly in the mass model (  [ sisgalsec ] ) , we see little change in most fitted model parameters and insignificant difference in the derived hubble constant .",
    "the primary aim of developing a mass model for the lensing galaxy in 0957 + 561 was to use the model to estimate the hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "our main result is given in equation [ [ honovel ] ] .",
    "the tight constraints that we obtain for the parameters of the lens model translate via equation [ [ hoeq ] ] to a correspondingly tight constraint on the relation for @xmath12 in terms of the relative time delay @xmath13 . the coefficient in @xmath12 equation [ [ honovel ] ]",
    "has an uncertainty of only about @xmath322 .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath12 is asymmetric with respect to the optimum value for reasons discussed in  [ h15lims ] .",
    "note that the results quoted in this paper correspond to a flat universe ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "our derived value of @xmath12 increases almost linearly with decreasing @xmath37 , with a total increase less than 10% for @xmath323 .",
    "as equation [ [ honovel ] ] shows , 0957 + 561 could be used to obtain a useful estimate of @xmath12 provided the relative time delay @xmath13 is measured with sufficient precision and the convergence @xmath4 due to the cluster is estimated .",
    "many years of work have gone into collecting the required data for estimating @xmath13 , both in optical ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and radio ( @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of @xmath13 have however varied , with two distinct values emerging from different data sets and analyses : @xmath324 days ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath325 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two estimates individually have very small formal errors , so that they are seriously inconsistent with each other .",
    "ongoing work is expected to resolve this problem shortly .",
    "meanwhile , in this paper , we have explicitly presented our results according to both claimed time delays , using scaling factors @xmath326 and @xmath327 respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath132 in equation [ [ h1.5eq ] ] arises because of a degeneracy in lens models discovered by falco _",
    "et al . _  ( 1985 ) and gorenstein _ et al . _  ( 1988b ) .",
    "these authors showed that any lens model can be modified by reducing the mass in the lens by an arbitrary factor and substituting a constant density mass sheet of appropriate convergence @xmath4 .",
    "in such a transformation , all image observables except the time delay remain invariant .",
    "this means that a given set of lens observations can not provide a unique mass model but rather a one - parameter family of models parametrized by @xmath4 .",
    "since the value of @xmath4 modifies the predicted time delay , this unfortunately means that we can not obtain a unique estimate of @xmath12 from a given lens unless we independently estimate @xmath4 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath4 must necessarily be a positive number since it is proportional to the surface mass density of the sheet .",
    "therefore , we can always obtain an upper bound on @xmath12 ( narayan 1991 ) . from equation [ [ honovel ] ] we see that the 95% upper bound is @xmath328 for @xmath329 yr and @xmath330 for @xmath331 yr .",
    "fgs showed that it is possible to eliminate the @xmath4 degeneracy if we could measure the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath332 of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the idea is that the family of models with different values of @xmath4 have different amounts of mass in the primary lensing galaxy .",
    "this mass can be scaled to @xmath333 through the virial theorem .",
    "we discuss this approach in  [ veldi ] and show how the method would work in the case of the spls model . equation [",
    "[ h_0final ] ] gives the final result .",
    "rhee ( 1991 ) measured @xmath15 of the stars in the lensing galaxy in 0957 + 561 to be @xmath334 .",
    "unfortunately , the measurement is not sufficiently precise to provide a significant constraint on @xmath12 . a more precise measurement of @xmath15 should be possible with a large optical telescope and is highly desirable , as it would eliminate this last uncertainty in the modeling of 0957 + 561 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath15 refers only to the stars in the lensing galaxy , whereas the gravitational lensing is done by the total mass .",
    "there has been some uncertainty as to how the measured stellar @xmath15 should be related to the @xmath15 of the total mass , which is the relevant quantity for normalizing the galaxy mass distribution .",
    "the straightforward approach is to assume that the velocity dispersion of the stars and that of the dark matter particles are equal .",
    "however , turner _",
    "et al . _  ( 1985 ) argued that in many circumstances the @xmath15 of the stars would be lower than that of the total mass by a factor of @xmath335 .",
    "this makes quite an important difference to the results .",
    "for instance , narayan ( 1991 ) derived on the basis of the fgs model , assuming @xmath336 days ( @xcite ) and @xmath337 ( @xcite ) , that @xmath338 if the dark matter has the same dispersion as the stars and @xmath339 if the correction factor of @xmath335 is applied . the approach used in this paper , based on the work of kochanek ( 1993 ) , avoids the ambiguity since it is based on a fundamental application of the virial theorem .",
    "our model here gives , for the same parameters as the ones employed by narayan ( 1991 ) , @xmath340 .",
    "narayan ( 1991 ) has discussed an interesting additional benefit that one obtains by measuring @xmath15 . once the mass of the lens has been normalized through such a measurement , it is possible to obtain an estimate of @xmath12 that is independent of the source redshift . in other words ,",
    "the distance to the source drops out of the relations .",
    "this is , of course , not a particular advantage since most often the source redshift is known .",
    "however , a corollary of the theorem is that if there are additional mass sheets with shear between the lens and the source , say due to other clusters , the formula for @xmath12 is transparent to their presence provided the additional clusters are describable by quadratic potentials over the angular extent of the lensed images .",
    "this theorem is quite useful .",
    "there is evidence for a second cluster at redshift 0.51 in the field of 0957 + 561 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and there may well be other clusters at higher redshift .",
    "it is advantageous to be able to estimate @xmath12 independently of these complications .",
    "another interesting result is that with a measurement of @xmath15 one directly obtains the angular diameter distance @xmath341 to the lens regardless of cosmological model , i.e. the result is independent of the values of @xmath342 and @xmath42 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4 degeneracy can also be eliminated by estimating the mass surface density of the cluster directly .",
    "one simple method is to measure the core radius of the cluster , its velocity dispersion , and the location of the lens relative to the cluster center .",
    "we describe in  [ measclust ] how this information can be translated into an estimate of @xmath4 . using the parameter values given by rhee _",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) , we estimate that @xmath343 for the lensing cluster in 0957 + 561 .",
    "this translates to @xmath344 for @xmath345 and @xmath346 for @xmath347 .",
    "a more ambitious undertaking is to map the two - dimensional surface density of the cluster using the weak distortions of background galaxies .",
    "the idea for this method goes back to tyson , wenk , & valdes ( 1990 ) and kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) are currently applying the method to the field around 0957 + 561 and results are awaited .",
    "what is the future for lens - based measurements of the hubble constant ?",
    "we believe 0957 + 561 will deliver a result soon .",
    "it is only a matter of time before the controversy over the time delay is settled . our model ( _ cf .",
    "_  eq .  [ [ h1.5eq ] ] ) will then directly provide an upper bound on @xmath12 or a direct estimate if we take the value of @xmath348 mentioned above .",
    "measuring @xmath15 and thereby obtaining a more reliable estimate of @xmath4 is more challenging , but efforts are under way and once again we are optimistic . with measurements of both @xmath13 and @xmath15 , our model should provide an estimate of @xmath12 which would be quite competitive with other determinations .",
    "there is unfortunately one major remaining uncertainty , namely whether our model captures the mass distribution of the lens sufficiently well .",
    "the poor reduced @xmath6 of our model is certainly a concern .",
    "perhaps a mass - traces - light model will improve matters , or perhaps future observations will resolve our spls discrepancies . in any case , it is desirable to study additional lenses in order to obtain other independent estimates of @xmath12 .",
    "it is generally agreed that 0957 + 561 is not the best source for estimating @xmath12 since the presence of the cluster adds an extra layer of complication .",
    "several other good candidates are available where the lensing galaxy appears to be more or less isolated .",
    "such systems are easier to model .",
    "the radio ring sources are particularly promising since the modeling of these is likely to be more reliable than with multiply - imaged optical quasars .",
    "the experience with 0957 + 561 shows that having information on the full relative magnification matrix and its spatial derivative is invaluable for constraining the mass model .",
    "therefore , resolved sources which can be mapped and modeled in detail are likely to be much superior to unresolved sources .    to conclude , we emphasize that the lens - based method of estimating @xmath12 is completely independent of all other methods and works directly on high redshift sources without using any intermediate distance ladders . furthermore , the method is based on very basic geometry and physics .",
    "these are substantial advantages , and we feel that the method deserves to be pursued seriously .",

    "as we often observe galaxies to have elliptical isophotes , it would be appealing to model their lensing properties with a mass distribution having elliptical isodensity contours .",
    "a simple example is the homoeoid , whose isodensity contours are concentric ellipses of constant ellipticity and position angle .",
    "the surface density of the homoeoid varies only as a function of the elliptical `` radius '' @xmath349 from the center of the distribution : @xmath350 where the parameter @xmath231 reflects the degree of flattening . in the above equation and throughout the remainder of this appendix",
    ", we assume that the major axis of the elliptical profile is aligned with the @xmath23-axis of our coordinate system . from equation [ [ remeq ] ]",
    ", we relate the asphericity parameter @xmath231 to the axis ratio of isodensity contours : @xmath351 we emphasize that @xmath231 is _ not _ equivalent to the ellipticity @xmath352 , defined by @xmath353 .",
    "bourassa & kantowski ( 1975 ) found that the lensing properties of generic elliptical mass distributions may be compactly expressed by adopting a complex angular notation , where vector angles @xmath44 map to the complex plane according to @xmath354 .",
    "they derived the complex ray deflection @xmath355 for a general homoeoidal density profile @xmath356 : @xmath357 with @xmath358 as the complex conjugate of @xmath359 .",
    "here @xmath360 denotes the branch of the complex square root for which @xmath361 and @xmath358 lie in the same quadrant of the complex plane ( bray 1984 ) .",
    "as noted by schramm ( 1994 ) , closed solutions of equation [ [ compdef ] ] for general elliptical lenses have rarely been found ( narasimha 1982 , @xcite ) and are by construction restricted to density profiles with homoeoidal symmetry .",
    "@xcite have shown that equation [ [ compdef ] ] has a closed form for softened isothermal homoeoids , whose density profiles are characterized by central convergence @xmath362 and core radius @xmath1 : @xmath363 the complex ray deflection for the softened isothermal homoeoid is @xmath364 } \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath365 , @xmath366 , and @xmath367 is the asymptotic einstein radius for @xmath368 .",
    "we have found that a closed form of the ray deflection equation [ [ compdef ] ] also exists for the singular power - law homoeoids .",
    "the density profile of the singular power - law homoeoid is parameterized by asymptotic ( @xmath369 ) einstein radius @xmath110 and power - law index @xmath2 of radial mass increase : @xmath370 substituting the surface density from equation [ [ singplh ] ] into the integrand of equation [ [ compdef ] ] , we obtain the complex ray deflection of the singular power - law homoeoid : @xmath371 where @xmath372 and @xmath373 is the complex hypergeometric function . in the limit of azimuthal symmetry ( @xmath374 , @xmath375 and the hypergeometric function becomes unity .",

    "such potentials vary only as a function of the elliptical radius @xmath377 $ ] , characterized by asphericity parameter @xmath378 .",
    "although the lensing properties of elliptical potentials are easily expressed in closed form , their associated isodensity contours are sometimes unphysical .",
    "elliptical potentials with more than a moderately high asphericity @xmath379 require isodensity contours that are dumbbell - shaped ( @xcite ) . in certain cases , highly flattened elliptical potentials may even require _ negative _ isodensity contours ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , elliptical potentials provide quite an accurate representation of elliptical mass distributions for ellipticities @xmath380 .",
    "fortunately for this study , the 0957 + 561 lensing galaxy g1 has an isophotal ellipticity compatible with this limit .",
    "isothermal ( @xmath101 ) elliptical potentials have been popular in the modeling of aspherical galaxies ( _ e.g. _  blandford & kochanek 1987 ; kochanek & blandford 1987 ; @xcite ) , but we seek an elliptical potential which has the radial power - law generality of the splh .",

    "<S> we present a simple mass model for the lensing galaxy in the gravitationally lensed quasar 0957 + 561 . </S>",
    "<S> we represent the galaxy as a softened power - law sphere ( spls ) , a generalization of the singular isothermal sphere with three parameters  @xmath0 , the central density , @xmath1 , the angular core radius , and @xmath2 , the radial index which is defined such that mass increases as @xmath3 at large radius . as in previous studies we approximate the galaxy cluster surrounding the lensing galaxy by means of a quadratic potential described by its convergence @xmath4 and shear @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a feature of the model is that it does not require a large central compact mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we fit the model to a recent high resolution vlbi map of the two images of 0957 + 561 . </S>",
    "<S> the data provide a number of independent constraints and the model - fit has six degrees of freedom , which is a significant improvement over previous models . </S>",
    "<S> although the reduced @xmath6 of the best - fit model is only 4.3 , nevertheless we obtain a tight constraint on the radial index , @xmath7 , at the 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the galaxy has mass increasing slightly more rapidly than isothermal ( @xmath8 ) out to at least @xmath9  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> since the light from the galaxy follows a de vaucouleurs profile , we deduce that the mass - to - light ratio of the galaxy increases rapidly with increasing radius . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain an upper limit on the core radius , namely @xmath10 or linear core radius @xmath11  pc .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the model to calculate the hubble constant @xmath12 as a function of the time delay @xmath13 between the two images . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath14 once @xmath13 is measured , this will provide an upper bound on @xmath12 since @xmath4 can not be negative . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the model degeneracy due to @xmath4 can be eliminated if the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath15 of the lensing galaxy is measured . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath16 we find that these results are virtually unchanged when we investigate the effects of ellipticity in the lensing galaxy and clumpiness in the lensing cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#1 = cmmib10 at 12pt = cmmib8 = cmmib7 99 9    `` 710b ' ' 710c `` 710d ' ' 710e `` 710f ' ' 7110 `` 7111 ' ' 7112 `` 7113 ' ' 7114 `` 7115 ' ' 7116 `` 7117 ' ' 7118 `` 7119 ' ' 711a `` 711b ' ' 711c `` 711d ' ' 711e `` 711f ' ' 7120 \" 7121    introduction in two seminal papers , refsdal ( 1964 , 1966 ) showed that there should exist a time delay between flux variations of multiple images of a lensed background source , and demonstrated that the time delay is inversely proportional to the hubble constant @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational lenses thus can be used to determine @xmath12 independently of traditional distance - ladder techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the lens method of estimating @xmath12 requires a measurement of the time delay and a determination of the mass distribution of the lens .    </S>",
    "<S> a particularly promising candidate for this technique is the first gravitational lens discovered , the so - called `` double quasar '' 0957 + 561 ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) , which consists of a pair of lensed images of a @xmath17 quasar separated by @xmath18 on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy responsible for the lensing , denoted g1 , was discovered by stockton ( 1980 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this galaxy is a bright cluster elliptical at redshift @xmath19 , residing in a cluster of galaxies which also contributes to the lensing ( garrett , walsh , & carswell 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> long - term monitoring of the optical ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and radio ( @xcite ) light curves of the two quasar images has provided strong evidence for a time delay , though there is still some uncertainty regarding the actual value of the delay ( press , rybicki , & hewitt 1992b , c ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observational uncertainties in the other observables such as the image positions , the relative image magnification , and the source and lens redshifts are small , leaving the lens mass distribution as the chief remaining obstacle to estimating @xmath12 using this system ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass distribution of the lens is difficult to measure directly , and has to be constrained using the observations of the lensed images .    </S>",
    "<S> it is customary to postulate a simple functional form for the lens mass profile , and to adjust the parameters of the model so as to obtain the best fit to the observables , namely the quasar image positions and relative image magnifications . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations have been done by various authors in the past ( @xcite ; @xcite ; greenfield , roberts , & burke 1985 ; @xcite ; falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1991 , hereafter @xcite ; bernstein , tyson , & kochanek 1993 , hereafter @xcite ) using the data available at the time . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a new model of 0957 + 561 which improves on previous work in two respects .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we employ a new parameterization of the lens mass , namely the softened power - law sphere ( spls ) model , which allows us to explore a wider range of radial mass profiles than in earlier studies . </S>",
    "<S> our model space includes the standard isothermal sphere model ( e.g. turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ) as a particular case , and one of our aims is to use the data to determine the degree to which the galaxy deviates from an isothermal radial profile . </S>",
    "<S> we also include a core radius for the galaxy and represent the surrounding cluster by means of a quadratic potential as proposed by fgs .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we make use of a larger set of data constraints than in any previous study . </S>",
    "<S> fgs for their modeling used high - resolution vlbi maps of 0957 + 561 ( @xcite ) which resolved features of an inner radio jet extending @xmath20 milliarcseconds from the quasar core of each image . </S>",
    "<S> this permitted them to derive a @xmath21 relative magnification matrix between the two quasar images which they used to constrain their model . </S>",
    "<S> recent @xmath2218 cm vlbi mapping of 0957 + 561a , b by garrett _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  ( 1994 , hereafter @xcite ) revealed even greater detail in the fine structure of the quasar images . </S>",
    "<S> the a and b inner jet regions are now resolved into five centers of emission with sub - milliarcsecond accuracy in the positions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xcite report a gradient in the relative magnification tensor between the quasar core and the end of the inner jet . </S>",
    "<S> this provides two additional data constraints which we include in our model - fitting . as a result of the additional data </S>",
    "<S> , we have a better - constrained lens model , with six degrees of freedom in the data fits , as against the previous studies by fgs and kochanek ( 1991 ) which had only one degree of freedom .    in  2 of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we briefly introduce the notation and approximations employed in this study , as well as the basic lens equations that allow us to test mass models against constraints from observation . in  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we review the observations of 0957 + 561 , paying particular attention to the high - resolution vlbi mapping by @xcite which provides the majority of our model constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the spls lens model in  4 and derive its lensing properties . </S>",
    "<S> we then employ the lensing equations of  2 to show explicitly the dependence of model - predicted observables , including the time delay , upon our various model parameters . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we do the same also for the fgs lens model . in  5 we describe the results of our model - fitting , both with our spls model and with the fgs model , and including the effects of ellipticity in g1 and clumpiness in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we derive confidence limits on the lens parameters and obtain bounds on @xmath12 . in  6 we address one of the chief difficulties in obtaining tight @xmath12 bounds from 0957 + 561 , namely the uncertainty regarding the amount of lensing contributed by the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we describe how this uncertainty can be removed by measuring the velocity dispersion of the galaxy , as shown by fgs , or by measuring the shape and velocity dispersion of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the paper in  7 and discuss prospects for further improvements in the method , both with 0957 + 561 and with other lens systems .    </S>",
    "<S> lensing geometry and notation [ approxcoordsec ]    we employ a cartesian coordinate system on the sky with the origin at the center of mass of the lensing galaxy g1 , the @xmath23-axis taken positive to the east , and the @xmath24-axis positive to the north . </S>",
    "<S> we define position angles to be zero toward the north and increasing eastward . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the standard angular diameter distance appropriate to a friedmann universe . for an observer at redshift @xmath25 and a source at redshift @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> the angular diameter distance is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 is the hubble constant . a proper length @xmath30 at @xmath26 subtends an angle @xmath31 at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> it is customary to use the abbreviations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 when referring to the angular diameter distances from observer to deflector , observer to source , and deflector to source , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the _ effective lens distance _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 which appears in the lensing equations below .    for simplicity , we assume @xmath36 in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the results to @xmath37 is rather small ( @xcite ) . for the 0957 + 561 lens , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 increases approximately linearly with decreasing @xmath37 , to a value @xmath39 larger for @xmath40 than the fiducial value for @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath42 can have a more important effect on the results ( _ e.g. _  turner 1990 ) , but we do not explore the dependence in this paper .    using standard notation ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ; schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) , we represent angular positions at the distance of the background source ( the `` source plane '' ) with the vector @xmath43 and angular positions at the distance of the deflector ( the `` image plane '' ) with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the lens mass deflects light rays at the image plane through an angle which we represent with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are then related via the lens equation , @xmath46 where the _ reduced _ deflection angle @xmath47 is related to the true deflection angle @xmath48 at the image plane by @xmath49 the ray deflection function @xmath50 may in general allow multiple solutions @xmath51 to the lens equation [ [ lenseq ] ] for a given @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> if a source happens to lie at such a @xmath43 , we observe multiple images of the source at positions @xmath51 , a gravitational `` mirage '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the lens deflection @xmath48 is sensitive only to the surface mass density of the deflector . with @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> representing linear position in the image plane , we may express the lens deflection angle as the two - dimensional gradient of a potential @xmath53 , @xmath54 the potential @xmath55 is related to the lens surface mass density @xmath56 according to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , we may express the deflection in terms of the green s function of the poisson operator , @xmath58 for a radially symmetric surface mass density profile @xmath59 , the above equation simplifies to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the projected mass of the deflector within cylindrical radius @xmath30 . </S>"
