    "even , small and smooth changes in parameters governing the dynamics of a physical system can , in some circumstances , result in a dramatic change of physical properties of the system itself .",
    "the traditional approach to these so - called critical phenomena is based on the notions of order parameter , correlation functions , symmetry breaking , and a general formulation in the framework of the landau - ginzuburg picture and renormaliztion group  huang .",
    "phase transition _ can be triggered e.g. , by a change of temperature of the system or , at zero temperature , by a change of some of the coupling constants ( e.g. , external fields ) defining the system s hamiltonian . in the first case one",
    "says that the transition is driven by thermal fluctuations , and the transition is referred to as _ classical _ , whereas in the second quantum fluctuations are held responsible for the transition and this latter is referred to as a _ quantum phase transition _ ( qpt )  @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "a big deal of interest has grown about the possibility of studying qpts by means of ideas and tools borrowed from the new born field of quantum information science @xcite . in this novel approach",
    "the key concept involved is quantum entanglement ( or genuinely quantum correlations ) and the idea is that quantum criticality can be suitably characterized in terms of the behavior of different entanglement measures @xcite . though the picture is still rapidly moving it",
    "is by now clear that , whereas there are no doubts that entanglement is indeed a valuable conceptual tool to analyze qpts , one has , case by case , identify what is the entanglement measure e.g. , block - entanglement or concurrence most suited to extract the relevant information .",
    "more recently an approach to qpts based on another quantum information notion i.e. , _",
    "quantum fidelity _ , has been put forward  za - pa , za - co - gio .",
    "the idea behind this novel approach is quite simple : the dramatic chance of the structure of the ground state occurring at the critical points can be fruitfully studied by analyzing their degree of distinguishability . since this latter quantity is related to the overlap i.e. , scalar product , between two different ground states ,",
    "the fidelity approach is basically nothing but than a _",
    "one ; the key ingredient being provided by the state - space distance between states corresponding to two slightly different sets of coupling constants .",
    "the expectation is that at the critical points a small change of the control parameters should result in an enhanced modification of the state structure and this in turn should be detected by a greater state - space distance i.e. , statistical distinguishabiliy , between the associated quantum states . in spite of its apparent naivety , this metric - based approach turns out to be able to provide an effective way to obtain , qualitative as well as quantitative , information about the zero - temperature phase diagram of a large class of non trivial quantum systems i.e. , quasi - free fermionic systems @xcite and matrix - product states @xcite .",
    "the conceptual appealing of the fidelity approach for detecting boundaries between different phases lie in its universal geometrical as well as information - theoretic nature ; in principle no apriori knowledge of the symmetry - breaking mechanism and of the associated order parameters is required .    in this paper",
    "we are going to extend the fidelity approach to _ finite temperature_. this generalization can be achieved by exploiting the mixed - state fidelity introduced by uhlmann  @xcite and related to the statistical distance between two density operators ( bures distance ) .",
    "this finite temperature extension of the fidelity approach is a non - trivial technical step necessary to analyze the signatures of qpts at non zero temperature and , more in general , to investigate the potential usefulness of the fidelity notion in the study of classical i.e. , temperature - driven phase transitions @xcite . in the following",
    "we will focus on the first task .",
