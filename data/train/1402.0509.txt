    "the secular effects can be determined by averaging the disturbing function over the binary and planetesimal orbital motion .",
    "the overall dynamical effect is the oscillation of planetesimal eccentricities about the forced eccentricity @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the individual star masses , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the binary and planetesimal semi - major axis and eccentricity respectively .",

    "figure [ fig : collspatevo ] shows the occurrence rate of each collision type as a function of radial distance from the central star(s ) . in the single star case , the collision occurrence rates are almost independent of semi - major axis due to the small radial range and values of planetesimal eccentricities . in general , planetesimals around a single star grow .",

    "growth events contribute between 30 - 35@xmath44 of collisions at the outer disk boundary , and only 12@xmath44 at the location of kepler-34b . in the outer regions of the simulation domain",
    "the collision occurrence rates begin converging towards that of the single star , however , the occurrence of hit - and - runs is 20@xmath44 higher due to the number of oblique collisions from orbit crossings .",
    "the ripg run has a 12@xmath44 increase in hit - and - runs at the outer disk edge than the ipg run .",
    "this difference is due to a higher proportion of collisions in the ripg case having a large impact parameter .",

    "in addition , the impact speed ( @xmath47 ) is much broader in the circumbinary cases with a modal value of 1.1 km s@xmath48 and a maximum value of 5 km s@xmath48 compared to the modal @xmath49 km s@xmath48 and a maximum value of 3 km s@xmath48 in the single star case .    the absence of gravitational focusing in the ripg circumbinary run results in a larger percentage of collisions with a high impact parameter ( fig [ fig : ip]c ) .",
    "we also observe slightly inflated impact velocities ( fig [ fig : ip]d ) .",
    "both these effects contribute towards a more hostile environment for sustained accretion .",
    "the radial distribution of the impact speed on collision outcome is shown in figure [ collevo ] .",
    "high speeds are found in the inner disk where the disk is most perturbed by the binary . a similar , albeit much weaker , effect",
    "is seen in the single star disk due to the increasing orbital velocity closer to the star .",
    "transitions between collision regimes are not abrupt , with a notable overlap of growth and non - growth events occupying the same velocity space . in addition , planetesimals that have had a collision have a slightly higher eccentricity @xmath50 = 0.03 than those that have not @xmath51 = 0.02 .",
    "however , only @xmath52 of planetesimals have been involved in a collision , hence a much longer simulation is required to probe the effects of collisional evolution on the dynamical temperature .",
    "these results emphasise the importance of using a collision model such edacm , which does not rely on impact speed alone to define collision outcomes .        during 2,000 @xmath22 the circumbinary planetesimal disk",
    "has amassed over 10,000 collisions , yet this is a fraction of the time needed to grow planetary embryos ( @xmath53 yrs for a single star * ? ? ?",
    "the high proportion of non - growth events in the circumbinary case contributes to a very slow physical growth rate .",
    "figure [ fig : growth ] highlights planetesimals that have grown beyond @xmath54 ( green dots ) .",
    "the majority of these planetesimals have increased in mass solely by perfect merging ; a mechanism which contributes a maximum of only 12@xmath44 at 1.5 au and a minimum of @xmath52 at the inner edge of the planetesimal disk .",
    "only @xmath55 of the disk mass belongs to planetesimals which have grown , the equivalent of 1600 planetesimal at their initial masses . of these",
    ", only 500 have exceeded twice their initial mass , meaning the majority of growth has likely been the result of partial accretion events , although those planetesimals with @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 could also be explained by disruptive collisions following perfect merging . the red line in figure [ fig : growth ]",
    "shows the occurrence of the total number of perfect mergers as a function of radial distance confirming a marginally higher growth rate in the outer disk .",
    "the lack of a trend in the location of accretion events and small number of grown material reveals the inability of sustained growth of material in such a disk .",
    "instead , planetesimals appear to grow through ` lucky ' collisions that are a result of the occasional randomisation of their orbital velocity vectors that leads to low speed encounters .",
    "kepler-34(ab)b orbits at 1.09 au which falls in a regime where only 12@xmath44 of collisions lead to growth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collspatevo]b ) .",
    "although the eccentricity forcing falls off with @xmath59 , @xmath10 only drops to the mean initial eccentricity ( e = 0.007 ) at 1.7 au .",
    "however , it may not be essential to retrieve an identical environment to that of the single star case in order to sustain growth . by 1.5 au mass changing collisions",
    "are split between partial erosion and partial accretion events , therefore , by 1.5 au prolonged planetesimal growth becomes more sustainable .",
    "thus , a likely scenario is that kepler-34(ab)b formed beyond 1.5 au and migrated inwards .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we retrieve this highly erosive disk that is unable to support sustained growth , despite our large - sized planetesimals .    .",
    "green points : @xmath60 , black points : @xmath61 .",
    "the red line shows contribution from perfect mergers . ]    while the visual difference between the ipg and ripg cases is small , the underlying effects propagate through to the collision outcomes . the lack of gravitational focusing with ripg accounts for a higher proportion of oblique impacts that generally lead to an increase in hit - and - run events . while the majority of these collision are non - erosive , they do not contribute to the growth of the system .",
    "a more subtle point is that the inclusion of inter - planetesimal gravity results in collisions that would not otherwise occur in a scenario without gravitational focusing .",
    "this results in a number of low speed and accretion enabling collisions .    from these results",
    "we find that @xmath62 indicates a region of the planetesimal disk that is too perturbed to support planetesimal growth and @xmath63 may be calm enough for planetesimal accretion .",
    "if we apply this criteria to all known kepler circumbinary planets , and assuming that this critical value applies to @xmath64 as well , only kepler 47(ab)c could possibly have formed in - situ and all of the rest : kepler 34(ab)b , 16(ab)b , 35(ab)b , 38(ab)b , 47(ab)b and 64(ab)b , must have formed further out in the planetesimal disk and migrated inwards to their current location . the effect of a reduced collision rate at large orbital radii on the formation timescale of planets is possibly explained by @xcite who suggests that circumbinary planets have more time to form than planets around single stars due to the longer lifetime of disks around short period binaries .",
    "in this paper we presented results from high - resolution n - body simulations investigating the likelihood of in - situ formation of kepler-34(ab)b .",
    "we began with a unperturbed disk using eccentricity and inclination distributions from numerical simulations of planetesimal evolution around single stars and allowed the system to evolve to quasi - steady state while suppressing collisional evolution of the planetesimals .",
    "eccentricity forcing from the binary pumped up the planetesimal eccentricities to 10 times the initial mean value .",
    "after 1000 @xmath22 a quasi - steady state was reached where planetesimals with similar orbital radii take on eccentricity extremes , such that both circularised and eccentric bodies can occupy the same space .",
    "this is shown by the speckled effect in figure [ fig : multi]*d*. this new initial condition was highly perturbed , which meant many orbit crossing events occurred .",
    "after the initial condition was reached we allowed the planetesimals to evolve collisionally using our new collision model edacm based on @xcite which allows erosion , accretion , and bouncing events .",
    "the high eccentricity observed in the inner circumbinary disk translates into a dominance of super - catastrophic events seen in figure [ fig : collspatevo ] .",
    "the impact velocity and parameter decrease with increasing orbital radius ; the latter due to a narrower eccentricity dispersion resulting in a reduced number of orbit crossings .",
    "the number of high energy , erosive events decrease as a function of increasing semi - major axis .",
    "however , planetesimal growth events do not dominate the collision outcomes within the simulation domain ( @xmath65 au ) .",
    "we therefore show that the disk is a hostile environment even for our gravitationally strong 120 km planetesimals , suggesting even more difficulties for sustained accretion to occur in simulations that feature much smaller bodies .    using statistical arguments from collisional data , in addition to physical growth rates , we find that kepler-34(ab)b would struggle to grow in - situ .",
    "in addition , we suggest that from all the known kepler circumbinary planets only kepler-47(ab)c could have formed in - situ while the rest must have formed at larger @xmath8 where the protoplanetary disks were less perturbed by the binary stars and migrated inwards to their current location .",
    "we also show that inter - planetesimal gravity must be included in planet formation models in order to capture gravitational focusing effects that may be missed otherwise , such as low - velocity , growth - enabling impacts that may influence the outcome of the simulation .",
    "previous work which has attempted to hybridise a protoplanetary disk with a gas counterpart has suggested that the gas disk is similarly perturbed by a stellar binary causing further excitations to the planetesimal eccentricities , which , could further provoke unfavourable impact velocities @xcite .",
    "our simulations , therefore , likely present a best - case scenario for planetesimal accretion .",
