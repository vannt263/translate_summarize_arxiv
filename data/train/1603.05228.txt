    "<S> we evaluate the fermion condensate and the expectation values of the charge and current densities for a massive fermionic field in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional conical spacetime with a magnetic flux located at the cone apex . </S>",

    "<S> the expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectation values and contributions coming from particles and antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> all these contributions are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> related to the non - invariance of the model under the parity and time - reversal transformations , the fermion condensate and the charge density have indefinite parity with respect to the change of the signs of the magnetic flux and chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of the radial current density vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal current density is the same for both the irreducible representations of the clifford algebra . </S>",
    "<S> it is an odd function of the magnetic flux and an even function of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the expectation values in various asymptotic regions of the parameters are discussed in detail . in particular , we show that for points near the cone apex the vacuum parts dominate . for a massless field with zero chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> the fermion condensate and charge density vanish . </S>",
    "<S> simple expressions are derived for the part in the total charge induced by the planar angle deficit and magnetic flux . combining the results for separate irreducible representations , we also consider the fermion condensate , charge and current densities in parity and time - reversal symmetric models . </S>",
