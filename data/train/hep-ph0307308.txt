    "cp violation in the @xmath3 system is now firmly established .",
    "successful runs at both belle and babar detectors have made it possible for the weak phase @xmath4 to be measured accurately @xcite .",
    "this measurement of one of the interior angles of the unitarity triangle @xcite , is primarily performed using the so - called `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath5 .",
    "having achieved this , attention is now being focused on measuring @xmath4 using other modes . in the standard model @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite",
    "also measure @xmath4 to a good approximation .",
    "if the values of @xmath4 measured using various modes were to disagree , it would provide an indication of new physics ( np ) .",
    "indeed , at present there appears to be a discrepancy between the value of @xmath4 extracted from @xmath5 and that obtained from @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "should this difference remain as more data is accumulated , it would provide an indirect evidence for a np amplitude in @xmath9 .",
    "it is therefore important to explore other signals of np , in order to corroborate this result",
    ".    signals of np obtained by comparing @xmath4 extracted from @xmath10 and @xmath6 , rely on the fact that the decay amplitude for @xmath5 is dominated by a single contribution . in this case",
    ", the weak - phase information can be extracted cleanly , i.e.  with no hadronic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "however , this clean extraction is subject , to the absence of np .",
    "if np affects @xmath11@xmath12 mixing only , the analysis is unchanged , except that the measured value of @xmath4 is not the true sm value , but rather one that has been shifted by a new - physics phase . on the other hand",
    ", if the np affects the decay amplitude @xcite , then the extraction of @xmath4 is no longer clean  it may be contaminated by hadronic uncertainties .    np can affect the decay amplitude either at loop level ( i.e.in the @xmath13 penguin amplitude ) or at tree level .",
    "examples of such new - physics models include non - minimal supersymmetric models and models with @xmath14-mediated flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "if the new contributions have a different weak phase than that of the sm amplitude , then the measured value of @xmath4 , @xmath15 , no longer corresponds to the phase of @xmath11@xmath12 mixing , @xmath16 .",
    "( note that @xmath16 could include np contributions to the mixing . )",
    "if np is present and contributes to the decay amplitude , it would be preferable to have _ direct _ evidence for this second amplitude .",
    "one would also like to obtain information about it ( magnitude , weak and strong phases ) .",
    "it is therefore important to have as many independent tests as possible for np .",
    "one possibility is to search for direct cp violation .",
    "however , direct cp asymmetries vanish if the strong phase difference between the sm and np amplitudes is zero .",
    "it has been argued that this may well be the case in @xmath3 decays , due to the fact that the @xmath17-quark is rather heavy .",
    "we show , however , that if one considers @xmath3-meson decays to two vector mesons , @xmath18 , many signals for np emerge , including several that are nonzero even if the strong phase differences vanish .",
    "furthermore , if _ any _ np signal is found , one can place a lower bound on the size of the np amplitude , and on the difference @xmath19 .",
    "an angular analysis of any of the modes such as @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath22 can be used for such a study .",
    "a similar analysis can be used within the sm to analyze decays such as @xmath23 .    in section [ sec2 ] of the talk",
    "we examine how the large number of observables that @xmath24 , decay modes provide are modified in the presence of np . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive ` 12 ' relations , the violation of any of which would signal np . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we briefly discuss constraints on the size of np as well as on @xmath19 , which can be obtained if np is observed .",
    "consider the decay @xmath24 , to which a single weak decay amplitude contributes within the sm .",
    "suppose that there is a new - physics amplitude , with a different weak phase , that contributes to the decay .",
    "the decay amplitude for each of the three possible helicity states may be generally written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the sm and np amplitudes , respectively , @xmath29 is the new - physics weak phase , the @xmath30 are the strong phases , and the helicity index @xmath31 takes the values @xmath32 .",
    "using cpt invariance , the full decay amplitudes can be written as @xmath33 where the @xmath34 are the coefficients of the helicity amplitudes written in the linear polarization basis .",
    "the @xmath34 depend only on the angles describing the kinematics @xcite .",
    "the above equations enable us to write the time - dependent decay rates as @xmath35 thus , by performing a time - dependent angular analysis of the decay @xmath36 , one can measure 18 observables .",

    "note that @xmath16 may include np effects ( in the sm , @xmath40 ) .",
    "note also that the signs of the various @xmath41 terms depend on the cp - parity of the various helicity states .",
    "we have chosen the sign of @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be @xmath44 , which corresponds to the final state @xmath45 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that one can not extract @xmath16 .",
    "there are a total of six amplitudes describing @xmath0 and @xmath49 decays [ eq .  ( [ amps ] ) ] .",
    "thus , at best one can measure the magnitudes and relative phases of these six amplitudes , giving 11 measurements .",
    "since the number of measurements ( 11 ) is fewer than the number of theoretical parameters ( 13 ) , one can not obtain any of the theoretical unknowns purely in terms of observables .",
    "in particular , it is impossible to extract @xmath16 cleanly .",
    "in the absence of np , @xmath50 . the number of parameters is then reduced from 13 to 6 : three @xmath27 s , two strong phase differences ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath16 . all of these can be determined cleanly in terms of observables .",
    "there are 18 observables , but only 6 theoretical parameters , thus 12 relations must exist among the observables in the absence of np .",
    "( of course , only five of these are independent . )",
    "these 12 relations are : @xmath52\\nn    \\\\ & &    \\frac{\\rho_{\\perp i}^2}{4\\lambda_{\\perp\\perp}\\lambda_{i        i}-\\sigma_{\\perp i}^2}=\\frac{\\lambda_{\\perp\\perp}^2",
    "-\\rho_{\\perp\\perp}^2}{\\lambda_{\\perp\\perp}^2}~.    \\label{eq : no_np}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the important consequence is @xcite that _ the violation of any of the above relations will be a smoking - gun signal of np . _",
    "it may be emphasized that the angular analysis of @xmath18 decays provides numerous tests for the presence of np .",
    "the observable @xmath53 deserves special attention @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ observables ] ) , one sees that even if the strong phase differences vanish , @xmath53 is nonzero in the presence of np ( @xmath54 ) , in stark contrast to the direct cp asymmetries ( proportional to @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath56 helicity is cp - odd , while the @xmath57 and @xmath58 helicities are cp - even . while the reconstruction of the full @xmath59 and @xmath60 decay rates in eq .",
    "( [ decayrates ] ) requires both tagging and time - dependent measurements , the @xmath61 terms survive even if the two rates for @xmath59 and @xmath60 decays are added together .",
    "we note also that these terms are time - independent .",
    "therefore , _ no tagging or time - dependent measurements are needed to extract @xmath53 _ !",
    "it is only necessary to perform an angular analysis of the final state @xmath62 .",
    "thus , this measurement can even be made at a symmetric @xmath3-factory .",
    "the decays of charged @xmath3 mesons to vector - vector final states are even simpler to analyze since no mixing is involved .",
    "one can in principle combine charged and neutral @xmath3 decays to increase the sensitivity to np .",
    "a nonzero value of @xmath53 would provide a clear signal for np @xcite .",
    "the decays of both charged and neutral @xmath3 mesons to @xmath22 can be analyzed similarly . because these modes are dominated by a single decay amplitude in the sm , no direct cp violation is expected .",
    "further , since this is not a final state to which both @xmath11 and @xmath12 can decay , no indirect cp violation is possible either .",
    "an angular analysis of these decays would therefore be very interesting in exploring the presence of np .",
    "it must be noted that , despite the large number of new - physics signals , it is still possible for the np to remain hidden .",
    "this happens if a singular situation is realized .",
    "if the three strong phase differences @xmath63 vanish , and the ratio @xmath64 is the same for all helicities , i.e. @xmath65 , then it is easy to show that the relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : no_np ] ) are all satisfied .",
    "thus , if the np happens to respect these very special conditions , the angular analysis of @xmath66 would show no signal for np , yet the measured value of @xmath4 would not correspond to the actual phase of @xmath11@xmath12 mixing .",
    "we have argued earlier , that in the presence of np one can not extract the true value of @xmath16 .",
    "however , as we will describe below , the angular analysis does allow one to constrain the value of the difference @xmath67 , as well as the size of the np amplitudes @xmath68 .",
    "naively , it appears impossible to obtain any constraints on the np parameters , since we have 11 measurements , but 13 theoretical unknown parameters .",
    "however , because the equations are nonlinear , such constraints are possible .",
    "below , we list some of these constraints @xcite    in the constraints , we will make use of the following quantities . for the vector - vector final state , the analogue of the usual direct cp asymmetry is @xmath69 , which is helicity - dependent . for convenience ,",
    "we define the related quantity @xmath70",
    ". the measured value of @xmath71 can also depend on the helicity of the final state : @xmath72 can be recast in terms of a measured weak phase @xmath73 , defined as @xmath74 , where the @xmath75 @xmath76 sign corresponds to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . in terms of these quantities , the size of np amplitudes @xmath79 may be expressed as 2b_^2 ^ 2= _ ( 1-y_(2^meas_-2 ) )  .",
    "[ eq : a - b-2 ]    the form of the constraints depends on which new - physics signals are observed ; we give a partial list below .",
    "for example , suppose that direct cp violation is observed in a particular helicity state . in this case",
    "a lower bound on the corresponding np amplitude can be obtained by minimizing @xmath68 with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath29 : b^2 _ _ . on the other hand ,",
    "suppose that the new - physics signal is @xmath80 .",
    "defining @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the minimization of @xmath83 with respect to @xmath84 and @xmath29 yields ( b_i^2 b_j^2 ) -  , [ eq : bsq - omega - bounds ] where @xmath85 is assumed . if there is no direct cp violation ( @xmath86 ) , but @xmath53 is nonzero , one has 2 ( b_i^2 b_^2 ) _ ii _ -  .",
    "[ eq : bsq - lambda - bounds ] one can also obtain bounds on @xmath87 , though this requires the nonzero measurement of observables involving the interference of different helicities .",
    "for example , if @xmath53 is nonzero and @xmath86 , we find @xmath88 -12truemm _",
    "ii _ i - _ _  . if @xmath89 , one can not have @xmath90 .",
    "these constraints therefore place a lower bound on @xmath91 and/or @xmath92 .",
    "a - priori , one does not know which of the above constraints is the strongest  this depends on the actual values of the observables .",
    "of course , in practice , one will simply perform a fit to obtain the best lower bounds on these np parameters @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting to study analytically the dependence of constraints as a function of observables which would signal np if non - zero .",
    "if the apparent discrepancy in the value of @xmath71 as obtained from measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite is on account of np , angular analyses of @xmath93 and @xmath94 would allow one to determine if np is indeed present .",
    "if np signal is confirmed , this analysis would allow one to put constraints on the np parameters .",
    "finally , we note that this analysis can also be applied within the sm to decays such as @xmath95 .",
    "these decays have both a tree and a penguin contribution , so that @xmath16 can not be extracted cleanly .",
    "assuming no np , the above analysis allows one to obtain lower bounds on the ratio of penguin to tree amplitudes , as well as on @xmath96 .",
    "this can serve as a cross - check on other measurements of @xmath16 , as well as on model calculations of the hadronic amplitudes .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the cleanest extraction of the cp angles comes from neutral @xmath3 decays that are dominated by a single decay amplitude . if there happens to be a new - physics ( np ) contribution to the decay amplitude , with a different weak phase , this could seriously affect the cleanliness of the measurement .",
    "there is already a hint of such np , as indicated by the discrepancy between the value of @xmath4 extracted from @xmath5 and that obtained from @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is important to confirm this through independent direct tests , and to make an attempt to obtain information about the np amplitude , if possible .",
    "we have shown that this type of np can be probed by performing an angular analysis of the related @xmath0 decay modes .",
    "there are numerous relations that are violated in the presence of np , and several of these signals remain nonzero even if the strong phase difference between the sm and np amplitudes vanishes .",
    "the most incisive test is a measurement of @xmath89 . to obtain this observable , neither tagging nor time - dependent measurements are necessary",
    " one can combine all neutral and charged @xmath3 decays .",
    "furthermore , should a signal for np be found , one can place a lower bound on the difference @xmath67 , as well as on the size of the np amplitudes . by applying this analysis to the decays @xmath97 and @xmath94",
    ", one can confirm the presence of the np that is hinted at in the measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it can even be applied within the sm to analyze decays such as @xmath95 , which receive both tree and penguin contributions .",
