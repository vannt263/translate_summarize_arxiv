    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling offers a way to manipulate the spin degree of freedom of the charge carriers through the control of their motion @xcite .",
    "the realization of devices where such control is achieved is at the core of spintronics and can have an enormous impact on applications ranging from memories to quantum computing .",
    "recently , spin - orbit interaction has received great interest also in relation with superconductivity , due to the possibility to induce unconventional superconducting order parameters @xcite , and likewise in the search for majorana states in hybrid structures , where a semiconductor nanowire , hosting so coupling , is placed in contact with superconducting electrodes @xcite .",
    "+ the 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) present at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto ) interface exhibits rashba so coupling which is tunable using the electric field effect @xcite . differently from 2deg in semiconductor heterostructures , the carriers at the lao / sto interface",
    "are hosted by 3__d _ _ electronic orbitals , potentially impacting the strength and nature of the so coupling @xcite .",
    "moreover , lao / sto interfaces undergo a superconducting transition , also widely tunable by electric gating @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to identify the various transport regimes of the 2deg across a wide range of carrier concentrations and temperatures , in order to map the relation between so and superconductivity in this system . to this purpose , we realized nanoscale field effect devices with a side - gate configuration .",
    "this new layout allowed us to perform a local modulation of the carrier concentration at the lao / sto interface with unprecedented efficiency and to reach very low carrier densities while keeping good metallic contacts for the voltage probes .",
    "we used these devices to study the magnetotransport characteristics of lao / sto and we uncover a crossover line between a transport regime described by weak - localisation ( wl ) and one characterized by weak - antilocalisation ( wal ) , where spin - orbit interaction is the dominant scattering mechanism .",
    "we find that the temperature range where wal is dominant , initially restricted to the millikelvin values for the strongly depleted state , becomes wider and wider when increasing the carriers concentration .",
    "moreover , we point out that the transition to the superconducting phase always takes place from within the rashba so coupling dominated transport regime .",
    "the field effect has been successfully used to uncover many of the exceptional properties of the lao / sto system @xcite .",
    "most of the work realized up to now uses a back - gate configuration , with an electrode deposited on the back of the sto single crystal substrate .",
    "this configuration capitalizes on the high dielectric constant of sto , although it requires large gate voltages due to the thickness of the gate dielectric , typically 0.5  mm .",
    "more recently , top gate configurations were also developed , using lao as the gate dielectric @xcite or realizing electric double layer transistors @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we use a side - gate configuration , as sketched in figure [ fig1 ] : this set - up allows us to take advantage of the high dielectric constant of sto , using a reduced effective thickness of the dielectric gate and thereby decreasing the applied gate voltages @xcite .",
    "+     is the channel width and @xmath1 is the distance between each side gate and the channel edge .",
    "( c ) finite element simulations of the electric field intensity : the @xmath2 plane at the middle of the channel is shown .",
    "the electric field lines are drawn in white.,width=4,height=9 ]    in order to design efficient devices , we performed finite element simulations of the side gate configuration using the comsol multiphysics software .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) shows a cut of the device along the @xmath2 plane , @xmath3 being the axis oriented along the channel and in the plane of the conduction .",
    "the thickness of the section in the @xmath4 direction is 20  @xmath5 m .",
    "as can be seen , the electric field lines ( drawn in white ) depart from the side electrodes and penetrate into the sto before bending and closing in correspondence with the 2deg channel .",
    "the effect on the gas is thus comparable to a back - gate action , with the electric field lines reaching the gas from below . the confinement of the electric field inside the sto substrate is due to its high dielectric permittivity @xcite .",
    "the simulations were done assuming , for the low temperature sto dielectric constant @xmath6 , the electric field @xmath7 dependence : @xmath8^{1/3 } } $ ] with @xmath9=25462 and @xmath10=82213  vm@xmath11@xcite .",
    "the simulation reveals a focusing effect of the field lines on the conducting path . in this way",
    ", a modulation of the carrier density of 10@xmath12@xmath13  v@xmath11 can be obtained for a 0.5  @xmath5 m wide channel separated from the lateral electrodes by 1  @xmath5 m ; _ i.e. _ a 1  v gate sweep can completely deplete the channel ( see the supplemental material for calculations of the charge induced in side gate devices of various dimensions . ) .",
    "we point out that , using the same simulation tool , we calculated a charge modulation of only 10@xmath14@xmath13  v@xmath11 for the conventional back - gate geometry , assuming a channel of several tens of microns .",
    "increasing the channel width @xmath15 or the separating dielectric gap @xmath1 strongly reduces the charge modulation ( see the supplementary material ) . for this reason ,",
    "the channels studied in this work have width @xmath15 ranging from 0.25 to 1.3  @xmath5 m , gaps @xmath1 from 0.7 to 1.7  @xmath5 m and length @xmath16 between 2 and 4  @xmath5 m .",
    "+ in order to fabricate these nanoscale devices , we followed the e - beam based patterning technique described in ref .  .",
    "we realize a templated substrate where an amorphous sto layer delimits the areas where the channel , the bonding pads and the lateral gate electrodes will be created . afterwards , we deposit by pulsed laser deposition @xcite a 10 unit cell film of lao which will grow epitaxially only in the channel , pads and gates . as the gate electrodes",
    "are realized simultaneously with the 2deg channel , this technique does not require any further fabrication step , and ensures minimal manipulation of the sample .",

    "for the first device , a gate voltage sweep of 0.6  v changes @xmath17 by three orders of magnitude .",
    "we also note that close to the insulating divergence of the resistance , the conductance swing is two orders of magnitude for @xmath2090  mv . during all the measurements",
    ", the leakage current remained below the na , even for the smallest gap .",
    "as a comparison , field effect devices with a conventional back - gate configuration require several hundred volts to perform a tuning of the same amplitude @xcite .",
    "moreover , using the side - gate structures we can extend our studies to extremely low doping levels , almost one order of magnitude below what is usually attained using the back - gate configuration .",
    "this is due to better focusing of the field lines on the channel , an effect that results in a local modulation of the carrier density ; the voltage probes , unaffected by the gate voltage , are hence not charge depleted and provide a good metallic contact throughout the experiment . + as expected , the application of the gate voltage changes the transport behavior of the 2deg dramatically . panel ( b ) of figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath17 vs. temperature behavior for three levels of the field modulated carrier concentration .",
