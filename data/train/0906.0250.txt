    "ultracold atomic gas provides a controllable platform to study strongly correlated many - body physics , which has attracted strong interest recently @xcite . to reveal many - body properties of the underlying systems ,",
    "normally one needs to detect some kinds of correlation functions .",
    "the detection method for atomic systems is typically very different from detection of condensed matter materials . for solid state systems ,",
    "linear responses provide a useful method to measure the system correlation functions . for ultracold atomic gases , measuring",
    "linear response is possible but not always convenient .",
    "a powerful and widely used detection method for atomic gases is based on the time - of - flight ( tof ) imaging technique  @xcite , which is unique to these atomic systems and has no counterpart in condensed matter materials . during the tof imaging ,",
    "one measures the light absorption of an expanding atomic cloud released from the external trap .",
    "the light absorption gives information of the density distribution of the expanded cloud , which , under some approximation , is proportional to the initial momentum distribution of the atomic gas prior to expansion .",
    "therefore , the tof imaging provides us a useful technique to extract the diagonal single - particle correlation function in the momentum space . with only the diagonal correlation in the momentum space , in general",
    "it is inadequate to reconstruct the real space correlation function . to fulfill this gap ,",
    "several methods have been proposed to introduce additional control techniques , and measure the real space correlation functions based on the atomic interference @xcite or the fourier sampling @xcite .",
    "some of the real - space correlations can also be inferred from measurement of the two - particle correlations which can be extracted from noise spectroscopy @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we discuss a method to extract information about full single - particle correlations in both the momentum and the real spaces , by measuring the density profiles in the tof images at different expansion times .",
    "our detection proposal is in the spirit of tomography in the spatial - temporal space , where the full correlations are reconstructed through certain algorithms .",
    "the method is strict for ( quasi ) one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , and can be applied to higher - dimensional cases where the symmetry is applied to reduce the effective dimensionality .",
    "compared with other detection schemes , this method is more direct in the sense that it relies solely on the tof images and does not require introduction of other challenging control techniques . besides , it only utilizes the mean density distribution of the resulting images , for which the detection is in general significantly easier than the measurement of quantum noise of the corresponding images . as an example of applications of this detection method , we consider a quasi-1d bose gas and demonstrate that all off - diagonal single - particle correlations can be reconstructed from a series of tof images at various expansion times .",
    "the feasibility of this method is analyzed under realistic experimental conditions of spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : expansion ] , we discuss the main reconstruction formalism by analyzing the ballistic expansion process of an atomic gas and showing how the single - particle correlations are obtained from density profiles in the tof images .",
    "we consider both the quasi-1d case and the high - dimensional cases where one can either separate variables or have spherical symmetry to reduce dimensionality . as a by - product",
    ", we also derive in this section the formula for the far - field limit , where the initial momentum distribution is directly connected with the final density profile , and obtain the quantitative conditions under which this far - field - limit formula is valid . after introducing the general formalism , to illustrate its applications we give an example in section  [ sec:1dbose ] by considering a quasi-1d bose gas , and",
    "demonstrate how correlations are reconstructed from the tof images .",
    "finally , we discuss the effects from finite spatial and temporal resolutions and conclude that this method is applicable within present experimental conditions .",
    "in most experiments , the atomic gas is usually prepared inside some external optical or magnetic trap .",
    "when the system achieves its thermal equilibrium , one detects the properties of its underlying many - body state through the tof imaging . to perform this tof imaging measurement ,",
    "one turns off the external trap such that the atomic gas starts to expand in space . for simplicity , we assume a ballistic expansion process where the atomic interaction is negligible during the expansion . this is typically a good approximation for optical lattice experiments when the atomic density is not high @xcite . for strongly interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance , to get the ballistic expansion , one needs to first sweep the magnetic field to the deep bec or bcs side to turn off the interaction , as done in many experiments .    for a ballistic expansion",
    ", the atomic cloud freely expands and the expansion dynamics is already known . before turn - off of the trap ,",
    "the system is in thermal equilibrium , and its single - particle correlation function is denoted by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the atomic field operator , which is either bosonic or fermionic corresponding to bosons or fermions , respectively .",
    "assume at time @xmath2 the trap is turned off , and we measure the density profile @xmath3 of the atomic cloud at various expansion time @xmath4 . from the measured density @xmath5 @xcite ,",
    "we would like to reconstruct the full single - particle correlation @xmath6 .",
    "note that this reconstruction is in general impossible for a three - dimensional system , where @xmath6 depends on six variables and @xmath7 has only four variables .",
    "the correlation @xmath6 therefore contains more information than the density profile @xmath5 .",
    "however , we will show in the following that for any quasi-1d systems , the reconstruction of the correlation functions can be done exactly .",
    "furthermore , the correlation can also be obtained for many practical high - dimensional systems , where the system either possesses spherical symmetry or can be separated in variables for the single - particle correlations .",
    "the expansion dynamics of the atomic cloud is well described by the schrodinger equation for the atomic field operator ( taking @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 the solution of this equation in the momentum space is simply given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fourier transform of the field operator @xmath12 at time @xmath4 , @xmath13 is the free propagator , @xmath14 is the atomic mass , and initial conditions are @xmath15 .",
    "the expectation value of density distribution thus takes the form @xmath16it is useful to define new variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with which the density expectation value becomes @xmath19where @xmath20 is defined to simplify the notation .",
    "an important feature of the density profile in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : density2 ] ) is that for long evolution time @xmath21 ( called the far - field - limit ) , the exponential term gives a rapid - oscillating phase factor except for the region around the point @xmath22 . as a consequence ,",
    "the integration over @xmath23 and @xmath24 is dominated by the contribution from such region , leading to an approximating form for the density expectation value ( see the derivation in appendix a ) @xmath25notice that the final density profile is directly proportional to the initial momentum distribution via a scaling relation @xmath26 .",
    "this formula has been widely used for interpretation to the measurement result from the tof images . for this far - field - limit to be valid , the expansion time needs to be sufficiently long .",
    "quantitatively , it has to satisfy the following condition @xmath27here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are characteristic scales for the extension ( variation ) of single - particle correlation function @xmath30 along the @xmath23 and @xmath31 directions , respectively . the derivation of this condition for the far - field limit is shown in appendix [ app : farfield ] .",
    "the extraction of momentum distribution only utilizes the measured density profile in the far - field limit .",
    "the density distribution measured at other expansion times contain more information about the single - particle correlations .",
    "next , we discuss how to inverse the relation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : density ] ) , and to reconstruct the off - diagonal correlations from tof images .",
    "we first discuss in detail the 1d system where the reconstruction algorithm is exact , and then generalize the method to higher dimensional cases by reducing to a set of 1d problems when symmetry or separability arguments are applicable .",
    "let us consider a quasi-1d atomic cloud along the @xmath32-direction where the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen through a deep potential such as an optical lattice .",
    "the density profile @xmath33 thus depends on correlation functions through a double - integration with two phase factors along the spatial and temporal directions , respectively .",
    "one can think about performing a double fourier transform to inverse the relation .",
    "specifically , we obtain@xmath34for the cases with @xmath35 , which is connected with the off - diagonal momentum correlations and hence of particular interest .",
    "notice that the integration over time is for @xmath36 only , since all the density profiles are obtained _",
    "after _ turn - off of the trap .",
    "this partial fourier transform hence generates the principal value ( @xmath37 ) integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n(p , w ) ] ) .",
    "this expression can be significantly simplified if the single - particle correlations are real .",
    "this condition is equivalent to assume a time - reversal symmetry throughout the system .",
    "in fact , for systems in a stationary frame , it is very unlikely for the time - reversal symmetry to be broken as long as there is no such symmetry breaking term in the hamiltonian @xcite . under this condition ,",
    "the principal value integral is purely imaginary , and the off - diagonal momentum correlation ( with @xmath38 ) can be solved as @xmath39 .\\end{aligned}\\]]therefore , with the measured density profile @xmath40 at different time @xmath4 , we can reconstruct all the momentum correlations through the formulae ( [ eqn : density - ffl ] ) and ( [ eqn : kcorrelation ] ) . with the knowledge of all momentum space correlations , the real space correlation function",
    "can also be obtained via a double fourier transform . after substituting the expression ( [ eqn : kcorrelation ] )",
    ", the integration over two momentum indices can be carried out analytically , leading to@xmath41 .\\end{aligned}\\]]here , the variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined to simplify notations .",
    "the convergence of the integration over time for @xmath44 is usually guaranteed by cancelation from the fast oscillation in the exponent @xmath45 .",
    "these two simple relations between the measured density profiles and the initial correlation functions in both the momentum space [ eq . ( [ eqn : kcorrelation ] ) ] and the real space [ eq . ( [ eqn : rcorrelation ] ) ]",
    "are the central results for this section .    after introducing the reconstruction scheme for the 1d case",
    ", next we consider the problem in higher dimensions .",
    "since the density profile @xmath46 is in fact a function of @xmath47(spatial)@xmath48(temporal ) variables , in the most general case it is no longer possible to fully reproduce the single - particle correlation , which is a function of @xmath49 variables .",
    "however , if the system has some properties which allows us to reduce dimensionality , a similar procedure can still be performed on the reduced problems .",
    "for instance , if there exists spherical symmetry in 3d systems , the field operator can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radial distance . in this case",
    ", the free expansion process is governed by the schrodinger equation in spherical coordinate , @xmath52by defining a new operator @xmath53 , the equation above becomes @xmath54notice that this equation has exactly the same structure as the schrodinger equation ( [ eqn : schrodinger ] ) for the 1d case , which allows us to obtain the single particle correlation function @xmath55 from the density distribution @xmath56 via a similar procedure as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rcorrelation ] ) .",
    "the reconstruction scheme can also be generalized to higher dimensional cases when the correlation functions are separable , i.e. , @xmath57 in this case , the higher dimensional problem can be effectively reduced to a set of 1d problems and then treated separately using the same method discussed above .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown how to reconstruct the single - particle correlations from the measured density profile for 1d systems and higher - dimensional cases where symmetry or separability can be used to reduce the effective dimensionality . to illustrate applications of this general formalism , in this section we consider a specific example and show hot to reconstruct the correlation functions for bosonic atoms in a quasi-1d trap . the reconstruction formula in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : kcorrelation ] ) and ( [ eqn : rcorrelation ] ) are given as double integrals of the measured density profiles .",
    "in realistic experiments , however , one can take only a finite number of images , and each image contains a finite number of resolvable data points . in the following discussion , we will take into account the finite spatial and temporal resolutions , and show that a good approximation to the correlation function can be inferred already from about a dozen of images .    in this example , we consider a quasi-1d bose gas trapped through either a highly elongated cigar - shaped potential @xcite or a deep transverse two - dimensional optical lattice  @xcite . in this quasi-1d geometry with strong radial confinement @xmath58 ,",
    "atoms at low temperatures are essentially frozen at the ground state of the radial harmonic trap .",
    "thus the radial wave function is governed by @xmath59where @xmath60 characterizes the extension of the radial wave function and @xmath14 is the atomic mass .",
    "when @xmath61 is much greater than the effective length scale of interatomic potential @xmath62 , the gas can be described with an effective 1d interaction rate  @xcite @xmath63where @xmath64 denotes the @xmath65-wave atomic scattering length in free space .",
    "the static single - particle correlation function in this quasi-1d system has been calculated by evaluating phase fluctuation effects around the saddle point condensate densities .",
    "this process gives the axial real - space correlation function  @xcite@xmath66where @xmath67 is the zero - temperature thomas - fermi density distribution in the axial direction@xmath68and the function @xmath69 takes the form@xmath70here , @xmath71 is the temperature , @xmath72 is the total atom number , @xmath73 denotes the chemical potential at the trap center , and @xmath74 is the thomas - fermi cloud radius along the axial direction ( with a small axial trapping frequency @xmath75 ) .",
    "we emphasize that we only use the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1dcorrelation ] ) as an example to illustrate our detection method .",
    "the derivation of this correlation is irrelevant for our following purpose .",
    "we assume a ballistic expansion of the atomic gas along the axial direction for tof imaging ( the transverse trap is still on ) , which allows us to numerically simulate the expansion process with the initial correlation given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1dcorrelation ] ) , and obtain the expected density distribution at each measurement time . using these resulting density profiles , then we try to reconstruct the corresponding correlation functions using eqs .",

    "if we have infinite spatial resolution and take an infinite number of images , we should be able to obtain exactly the same correlation function as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:1dcorrelation ] ) .",
    "so the purpose here is actually to analyze the effects from finite spatial and temporal resolutions as is the case for realistic experiments . in the following discussion , we assume to take only @xmath76 images , and for each image we only know @xmath33 for a discrete set of points from the finite spatial resolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof ] , we show a typical set of results for @xmath77 at various times . notice that we assume here a finite spatial resolution of @xmath78 m with @xmath79 , which gives about @xmath80 readable data points from the absorption image at the very beginning of @xmath2 .",

    "second , the reconstruction fails for @xmath92 very close to zero .",
    "this is because the tof images taken here are not for an infinite time duration . for the reconstruction , we take the data points within the ranges given by @xmath93 and @xmath94 for coordinates and time , respectively .",
    "since the reconstruction relies on a fourier transform , these finite ranges set a limit for the resolution in the momentum space .",
