    "there is a growing data set on radio supernovae of types ib / c and ii ( weiler et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 and references therein ) . the overall radio evolution can be described as an early phase when optical depth effects are important followed by a transition to a phase with an optically thin power law spectrum ( flux @xmath10 ) .",
    "the power law index for the electron spectrum , @xmath11 , has not been observed to vary in individual supernovae , although it does vary in the range @xmath12 for the group of radio supernovae ( van dyk et al .",
    "the time evolution in the optically thin regime can be described by a power law decrease ( flux @xmath13 ) , with @xmath14 ranging from 0.66 ( sn 1980k ; weiler et al .",
    "1992 ) to 1.6 ( sn 1983n ) .    the evolution of the fluxes from rsn 1998bw ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ; wieringa , kulkarni , & frail 1999 ; fig . 1 ) and",
    "the evolution of the spectral indices ( fig .",
    "2 ) show that the description of radio supernovae in the optically thin regime roughly applies to rsn 1998bw for ages @xmath15 days .",
    "the decline is approximately a power law in time with @xmath16 ( see also iwamoto 1999 ) .",
    "the electron spectral index shows some variation but generally is in the range @xmath17 .",
    "there are deviations from the late power law behavior , but the deviations are comparable to those found in other radio supernovae .",
    "sn 1998bw belongs to the class of type ic supernovae ( galama et al .",
    "because type ib and type ic supernovae have similar properties and differ from each other only in the presence or absence of optical he lines near maximum light , we compare sn 1998bw to both of these types .",
    "the parameters for the late evolution of radio supernovae of these types are sn 1983n ( ib ) : @xmath18 , @xmath16 ; sn 1984l ( ib ) : @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; sn 1990b ( ic ) : @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( van dyk et al .",
    "radio emission has also been observed from the type ic sn 1994i , but the results have not been fully published .",
    "observations at 15 and 88 ghz indicate an optically thin spectral index of @xmath22 ( wink 1994 ) .",
    "the radio spectrum of rsn 1998bw is flatter than those of other type ib / c supernovae and its decline rate is at the high end of those observed .",
    "the previously observed type ib / c supernovae have similar radio luminosities , within a factor of @xmath23 .",

    "sn 1998bw is extraordinary in that its radio luminosity is @xmath8 higher than that of the other type ib / c supernovae .",
    "it remains @xmath8 stronger than sn 1983n over the full observed period of 250 days .",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used the high brightness temperature of the source to argue for relativistic expansion .",
    "the straight lines in fig .",
    "3 are from the theory described in chevalier ( 1998 ) which assumes that optically thick phase of the supernova is due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the electron spectrum is assumed to be a power law ( @xmath24 in fig .",
    "3 ) which extends down to transrelativistic energies .",
    "an expression for the radius of the emitting region can then be obtained which depends on the factor ( magnetic energy density / relativistic electron energy density)@xmath25 . in fig .",
    "3 , the factor is taken to be unity ; the weak dependence on the energy density ratio provides justification for the assumption .",
    "the total energy in fields and particles goes up if the system is far from equilibrium .",
    "the position of sn 1998bw in fig . 3 is suggestive of relativistic motion , which means that the nonrelativistic theory used for fig .",
    "3 breaks down .",
    "in addition to its high luminosity , rsn 1998bw is also unusual in its evolution leading to the late power law decline .",
    "1 shows that the power law decline began at high frequencies ( 4.80 and 8.64 ghz ) on day 12 and continued through day 22 . between days 22 and 32",
    ", there was a rapid increase at these frequencies which raised the level of the power law decay by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior has not been previously observed in the light curves of radio supernovae , although sn 1987a has shown a strong rise in its radio flux ( ball et al .",
    "1995 ) which can be attributed to interaction with the dense wind from a previous evolutionary phase .",
    "the observed light curves generally do show fluctuations about smooth curves ( weiler et al .",
    "1999 ) similar to that seen in the late power law evolution of rsn 1998bw .",
    "the radio data on many supernovae are fragmentary , but there are excellent data at 5 frequencies on sn 1993j ( van dyk et al .",
    "1994b ; weiler et al .",
    "the radio evolution is smooth and can be modeled by shock - accelerated supernova ejecta running into a @xmath27 circumstellar medium ( fransson & bjrnsson 1998 ) .",
    "another anomaly in the early evolution of rsn 1998bw is the rise at 4.80 and 8.64 ghz before day 10 .",
    "the rise occurs with little change in spectral index , which implies that it is not due to a reduction in optical depth , as is the case in other radio supernovae .",
    "the properties of rsn 1998bw sufficiently resemble those of other radio supernovae to initially consider a model similar to those applied to radio supernovae .",
    "the standard model for these objects involves synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a spherical shocked region between the supernova and a surrounding circumstellar wind ( chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "the early optically thick phase can be dominated by either free - free absorption or synchrotron self - absorption , but the high velocities and low circumstellar densities found in type ib / c supernovae implies that synchrotron self - absorption is the dominant mechanism in these objects ( slysh 1990 ; chevalier 1998 ) .",
    "the same arguments apply to the type ic rsn 1998bw ( see also kulkarni et al .",
    "a significant new feature for rsn 1998bw is that the high shock velocity inferred for this radio supernova implies that all the postshock electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies . as in studies of grb afterglows ( waxman 1997 ; wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 )",
    ", we assume that the distribution of relativistic electrons with the lorentz factor @xmath0 takes a power law form with the number density given by @xmath28 above a lower limit @xmath29 , which is determined by the shock velocity .",
    "support for the assumption in the grb case can be found in the afterglow emission from grb 970508 ( galama et al .",
    "this distribution function distinguishes our model for rsn 1998bw from that of waxman & loeb ( 1999 ) , who assumed a thermal ( essentially monoenergetic ) electron distribution .",
    "relativistic electrons moving with a lorentz factor of @xmath0 emit synchrotron radiation of a characteristic frequency @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the charge and the mass of the electron , and @xmath33 the strength of the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the electron velocity . in the simplest case where the frequency of interest @xmath34 , the synchrotron spectrum has a @xmath35 spectral dependence in the optically thick region and a @xmath36 dependence in the optically thin region ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this simple model spectrum fails to reproduce two properties of the observed radio spectrum : ( 1 ) at the earliest times when the radio emission is most probably optically thick at the two highest frequencies ( 3 cm and 6 cm ) , the spectral index between them is closer to @xmath37 than to @xmath38 , as noted by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and waxman & loeb ( 1999 ) ; and ( 2 ) the observed spectrum is significantly broader than the above simple spectrum .",
    "these two discrepancies lead us to believe that the characteristic frequency @xmath39 is important in shaping the observed spectrum .",
    "we explore this possibility and try to infer the physical properties of the radio emitting plasma from @xmath39 and other parameters that determine the spectrum .",
    "a self - absorbed spectral index of 2 ( rather than 5/2 ) for radiation produced by electrons accelerated by a relativistic shock was predicted by katz ( 1994 ) .    in this section ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to emission from a nonrelativistically moving medium .",
    "it is well known that , in a synchrotron self - absorption model , the flux at a given frequency @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is a known function of @xmath44 ( shown , e.g. , on page 179 of rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , and @xmath45 is the optical depth of synchrotron self - absorption . from the standard theory , we have @xmath46 to simplify expressions , we define two auxiliary functions @xmath47 and denote the flux and the optical depth at a reference frequency @xmath48 ghz by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively . the flux at other frequencies can then be obtained from @xmath51      \\right\\},\\ ] ] where the dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath53 on @xmath39 and @xmath11 is suppressed for clarity .",
    "note that the relative flux @xmath54 depends on three parameters : @xmath50 ( the optical depth at @xmath48 ghz ) , @xmath39 ( the characteristic frequency corresponding to the lowest electron energy ) and @xmath11 ( the electron energy distribution index ) . by fitting the shape of radio spectrum at each day",
    ", we hope to determine these three parameters as a function of time .",
    "the shape of the observed spectrum is specified by three spectral indices , between 20 cm/13 cm , 13 cm/6 cm , and 6 cm/3 cm ( fig .",

    ", we find that reasonable fits are obtained for @xmath55 the fits are shown in figure  2 .",
    "we should point out that the spectral indices between 6 cm and 3 cm on day 3 and day 4 are not reproduced by our fits , indicating that processes other than synchrotron self - absorption might be important at such early times or that the simple power law evolution breaks down . in addition , both @xmath39 and the self - absorption turnover frequency have moved below the observed frequency range by day 50 so these parameters are not constrained by the observations at later times . over the time period that they are important for the observed radio emission , @xmath39 and the self - absorption turnover frequency are close to each other .    to convert the fitted optical depth @xmath50 , characteristic frequency @xmath39 , and index @xmath11 into physical quantities of the synchrotron emitting gas",
    ", we need to have a specific model for its geometry . here",
    "we adopt the simplest model of a thin , uniform , spherical shell of radius @xmath56 and thickness @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) times the radius . for a given value of @xmath11 , the optical depth , the frequency @xmath39 and the observed flux at a given frequency ( say , 6 cm ) , we determine three physical quantities , which we choose to be the total energy @xmath59 , the radius @xmath56 and the electron density @xmath60 .    for a power - law distribution of electrons given by equation ( 2 ) , we have from the standard theory @xmath61 taking into account the effect of spherical geometry approximately ( chevalier 1998 ) , and @xmath62 @xmath63 where the electron distribution coefficient @xmath64 is related to the electron energy density @xmath65 by @xmath66 and the minimum lorentz factor @xmath29 is given , from equation ( 9 ) , by @xmath67 making the usual assumption that the energy densities of electrons and magnetic fields are proportional to the total energy density @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 . , is one - third the more conventionally used fraction , @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the total field strength ) , for an isotropic electron distribution . ]",

    "clearly , the number density of the emitting electrons drops off with radius approximately as @xmath1 .",
    "since the density in the emitting region is related to the density in the ambient medium ( which supplies the emitting gas with matter through a strong shock ) by a simple compression factor , we conclude that the ambient medium must have a @xmath1 density profile as well .",
    "such a profile arises naturally in a stellar wind of constant mass loss rate and constant velocity from the progenitor star of the supernova .",
    "we can estimate the mass loss rate in the wind through @xmath95 where the subscript `` @xmath14 '' stands for the wind .",

    "so far , we have worked directly with the radio data and inferred from it properties of the emitting region using a simple radiation model .",
    "now we use these results as a guide and construct a more detailed model taking into account the dynamics of the emitting matter and relativity - two principal effects neglected in the above approach .",
    "we envision an instantaneous release of a large amount of energy @xmath99 in a @xmath1-density external medium .",
    "the energy released in the medium drives a blast wave whose dynamics can be deduced approximately from the following considerations . in the frame at rest with respect to the origin of the explosion ( and the observer ) , let the shocked external material be distributed uniformly in a shell of thickness @xmath100 ( much less than the outer radius of the shell , the shock radius @xmath101 ) .",

    "] these parameters are close to those used by waxman & loeb ( 1999 ) in their subrelativistic model for rsn 1998bw with a thermal electron distribution . for a power index of electron energy distribution @xmath24 and source distance @xmath86 mpc as before , we find a reasonable fit to the observed radio emission ( see figure  9 ) for the following set of parameters : a total initial energy of @xmath171 erg ; a stellar wind mass loss rate of @xmath172 km s@xmath161 ) m@xmath162 yr@xmath161 ; and a jump to a total energy of @xmath173 erg at a time @xmath174 days in the rest frame of the origin .",
    "note that the rising parts of all four model light curves at days 20  40 are nearly parallel to one another , in a better agreement with observations than the case with @xmath175 considered earlier ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "the reason is that the shock speed , also shown in figure  8 , is significantly lower in the @xmath169 case than in the @xmath176 case in the time interval of interest ; a lower shock speed tends to steepen the rise in the radio fluxes at short , optically thin wavelengths , since a larger portion of the re - energized shell contributes to the total emission at the given time .",
    "compared to the model of waxman & loeb ( 1999 ) , which was primarily intended for the observations on day 12 , our model has a higher shock velocity ( @xmath177 vs. @xmath9 ) and a higher energy by a factor of a few .",
    "the differences may be related to the fact that our model has a decelerating shock wave , includes relativistic effects , and assumes a power law electron distribution .",
    "these models show that models with a wide range of @xmath97 can approximately represent the data .",
    "the scaling between these models is discussed in the next section .",
    "however , we have found that acceptable models are even more widely distributed and can be found with @xmath178 .",
    "it appears that changes in @xmath39 and changes in the time lag effects can cancel each other out .",
    "the energy and ambient density of these models remains in the range of those given above .",
    "we have also investigated models in which the flux rise is due to a jump in the ambient density instead of an energy increase .",
    "although it is possible to obtain an increase in the extrapolated flux going to late times , it is not possible to obtain a fit during the transition period ( 20 - 40 days ) .",
    "in particular , the fluxes remain flat during this period instead of rising .    in the models with low @xmath97 so that radiative losses are less important , the predicted optical emission is comparable to that observed in day 1 of sn 1998bw ( galama et al .",
    "it points to the intriguing possibility that the rapidly - fading optical transient of grb 980425 was detected on day 1 .",
    "this possibility is diminished , however , by the fact that the model does not fit the early ( less complete ) radio light curves , before about day 10 .",
    "many of the previous discussions of grb afterglow light curves have assumed power law evolution based on smooth properties of the ejecta and the surrounding medium ( mszros , rees , & wijers 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "rsn 1998bw shows a more complex evolution , but our model indicates that over substantial periods of time the evolution is described by a constant energy shell in a @xmath27 medium . during these times the radio flux evolution is described by @xmath179 at optically thin wavelengths .",
    "mszros , rees , & wijers ( 1998 ) discuss the expected power law evolution in a @xmath27 medium for a relativistic flow and find that for @xmath180 and constant energy , @xmath181 . for @xmath24",
    ", we have @xmath182 , in good agreement with the observations of rsn 1998bw . the observed time period",
    "1224 days is especially useful because self - absorption and @xmath39 affect the evolution and provide diagnostic information .",
    "the optical depth at 1.4 ghz is moderately high and we expect @xmath183 , which is in agreement with the observations ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    the fact that a constant energy explosion in a @xmath27 medium describes the @xmath184 day evolution can be used to find scaling relations for the acceptable models .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath59 , @xmath185 ( where @xmath186 ) , @xmath98 , and @xmath97 . the parameter @xmath11 is simply determined by the observations .",
    "the observational constraints on these parameters can be described by @xmath39 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 , where @xmath188 is the frequency at which the spectrum becomes self - absorbed .",
    "the expected evolution of these quantities for a relativistic explosion in an @xmath1 medium is ( cf .",
    "waxman 1997 ; mszros et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath189 @xmath190 @xmath191 there are 3 constraints on the 4 model parameters , so there is not expected to be a unique model fit to the data .",
    "one way of describing the scaling of acceptable models is to fix @xmath39 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 at some time @xmath124 and find how 3 of the model parameters depend on the fourth one .",
    "for example , we find @xmath192 if one dynamical model with @xmath193 and @xmath194 fits the data , then another model with @xmath169 , @xmath195 , @xmath59 up by 10 , and @xmath185 up by 100 should fit the data equally well .",
    "this is in approximate accord with the results in the previous section . in the opposite direction ,",
    "increasing @xmath97 to equipartition with the postshock gas ( @xmath196 ) leads to moderately small decreases in the other parameters .",
    "our detailed models , discussed in the previous section , show that the range of acceptable parameters is broader .",
    "the emission is not from a single region , as is assumed in the power law model , but is integrated over a shell with time lags .",
    "these conditions allow a greater variety of models",
    ".    for the flux evolution in the optically thin regime , equations ( 39 ) and ( 40 ) can be combined to yield @xmath197 the observed flux increase from before day 24 to after day 32 is a factor of 2.2 ( see   2 ) .",
    "if this increase is due to an energy increase , equation ( 43 ) shows that @xmath198 and so @xmath59 must increase by a factor of 2.5 for @xmath24 .",
    "this result agrees well with the factor of 2.6 found in the detailed models .",
    "the failure of a density increase to account for the flux rise can also be seen from the power law dynamics .",
    "the flux at an optically thick wavelength is expected to increase as @xmath199 .",
    "a boost in the shock energy accelerates the expansion rate and accelerates the flux increase .",
    "an increase in the ambient density decelerates the shock and the flux increase .",
    "the data at 1.4 ghz , an optically thick wavelength , show an accelerating rise through the time of the flux increase .",
    "the implication is that the increase is due to an energy , not a surrounding density , increase , which is in accord with our detailed models .",
    "an extrapolation of the constant @xmath59 evolution to day 10 and earlier yields fluxes at 8.6 ghz that are higher than those observed .",
    "equation ( 41 ) shows that an attempt to model this solely as an energy jump yields a higher value of @xmath188 at early times .",
    "this would imply that the observed spectrum should be in the self - absorbed regime , or @xmath200 .",
    "the observed spectrum is not compatible with this form , which shows that the early flux increase requires factors in addition to or other than an energy increase .",
    "our models have implications for the nature of rsn 1998bw in the context of sn 1998bw and the possibly associated grb 980425 .",
    "models for the light curve and some spectra of sn 1998bw indicate that the progenitor star was the heavy element core of a massive star with a final mass of @xmath201 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) or @xmath202 ( woosley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "such stars are observed as wolf - rayet stars , which have winds with velocities in the @xmath203 range and mass loss rates @xmath204 ( willis 1991 ) .",
    "our @xmath193 model for rsn 1998bw implies @xmath205 and the @xmath169 model implies @xmath206 .",
    "the density range in the models overlaps the circumstellar density expected for a wolf - rayet star ; the high @xmath97 models yield a density that is somewhat too low , so there is a preference for the low @xmath97 models . the low @xmath97 models also appear to fit the rise in the radio light curves at days 20  40 better .",
    "the blast wave energies estimated during the observed period beginning on day 12 range from @xmath88 ergs with @xmath207 for the @xmath193 model and @xmath208 ergs with @xmath209 for the @xmath169 model . immediately after the impulsive energy increase ,",
    "the energies are @xmath210 ergs and @xmath211 ergs with @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the high and low @xmath97 models , respectively .",
    "these energies can be compared to those expected in the shock - accelerated high velocity ejecta of sn 1998bw .",
    "there is the possibility that the high radio luminosity is simply because of the higher explosion energy than that normally found in type ib / c supernovae .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1999 ) estimate that their spherical model for sn 1998bw produces @xmath214 ergs of ejecta with @xmath215 .",
    "although their models are nonrelativistic , matzner & mckee ( 1999 ) estimate the relativistic mass ejection that can be expected from an explosion like sn 1998bw .",
    "they note that a stripped massive star may not be sufficiently compact to produce any relativistic ejecta .",
    "a @xmath216 erg explosion with @xmath202 of ejecta in a sufficiently compact star should yield @xmath217 ergs of relativistic ejecta .",
    "the shock acceleration process yields a mass ( and energy ) that declines steeply with velocity , so the results are sensitive to the details of the model .",
    "the energy inferred for rsn 1998bw appears to be too high for the shock accelerated ejecta of sn 1998bw in spherical models , but this result is not conclusive .",
    "our model also places constraints on the time dependence of the energy input to the blast wave . for @xmath218 days",
    ", we find that the blast wave evolves with approximate constant energy except for an episode during which the energy is increased by a factor @xmath5 .",
    "the change does not appear to be due to the circumstellar medium and is probably due to inner material that catches up with the interaction region .",
    "this type of evolution is not expected for energy injection from shock - accelerated , high velocity supernova ejecta , which presumably have a smooth distribution .",
    "this property , along with the high energy in rsn 1998bw , suggests the presence of a central engine in the explosion . the fact that rsn 1998bw was accompanied by a type ic supernova with @xmath219 of material moving at moderate velocity ( galama et al . 1998b ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , implies that the high velocity outflow giving rise to rsn 1998bw is not spherically symmetric , but occupies only a fraction of the total @xmath220 solid angle if it originated in a central engine .",
    "macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) have proposed a model for sn 1998bw in which collimated , high - energy flows are created by a disk around a central black hole . the success of spherically symmetric models in describing normal grbs is usually attributed to relativistic beaming ; only a small part of a possibly asymmetric source is being observed .",
    "this argument does not apply to our model for rsn 1998bw because the velocities are only mildly relativistic and it is thus surprising that a spherically symmetric model is so successful .",
    "the introduction of asymmetries in the models brings in new parameters and we have not investigated such models .    the type of evolution that is observed in rsn 1998bw may be related to that observed in the optical afterglow of grb 970508 . in that case , there is evidence for a steady or decreasing flux before the 1.5 day rise phase leading to the maximum ( pedersen et al .",
    "an extrapolation of the early evolution implies that the rise is by a factor of 4 .",
    "mszaos , rees , & wijers ( 1998 ) suggest that the rise is due to a multicomponent flow or to a lower @xmath102 shell catching up with the main shock front .",
    "both of these models have been calculated in more detail by panaitescu , mszaos , and rees ( 1998 ) . in their model with late impulsive energy input , the energy increases from @xmath221 ergs to @xmath222 ergs .",
    "although the energies are larger than those inferred in rsn 1998bw , the factor increase in energy is comparable to the one that we have advocated for rsn 1998bw .",
    "a multicomponent flow model does not appear plausible for rsn 1998bw because of the continuity of the radio spectral indices during the time of the flux increase .",
    "the fact that we have found that rsn 1998bw has a central engine related to those found in normal grbs strengthens the association with grb 980425 and suggests that the relation of the radio emission to the early @xmath0-ray emission be investigated .",
    "however , there are several reasons why an energy conserving synchrotron model can not be simply extrapolated back to the very early times ( cf .",
    "iwamoto 1999 ) .",
    "first , we have found evidence in the radio light curves for at least one episode of impulsive energy injection .",
    "additional episodes could have also occurred before day 3 when the radio observations were initiated .",
    "the result would be lower flux values at early times .",
    "second , synchrotron losses become more important at early times .",
    "the frequency at which the synchrotron loss time equals the age is @xmath223 for constant energy evolution in an @xmath1 medium .",
    "the peak frequency evolves as @xmath224 , so that the blast wave was radiative in the past . taking @xmath225 ghz on day 10 implies radiative evolution before @xmath226 day in our high @xmath97 model .",
    "cooling is less important with low @xmath97 .",
    "third , the unusual behavior observed between days 3 and 12 may indicate that it may not be possible to extrapolate our model to small radii .",
    "finally , the early evolution may be affected by the character of the initial injection of energy .",
    "if the shell has an initial lorentz factor @xmath227 , its mass is @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is the initial energy .",
    "the deceleration radius , @xmath230 , occurs when the shell has swept up a mass @xmath231 in the circumburst environment .",
    "thus @xmath232 where @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and the reference value of @xmath235 corresponds to @xmath236 .",
    "the energy @xmath237 ergs is a lower limit based on the radiated energy in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the shell radius at @xmath238 s is @xmath239 cm . if @xmath227 starts at the lower end of the plausible range or if @xmath229 is high , the burst observations may be during the initial deceleration period .",
    "other possible factors are electron scattering opacity and @xmath240 opacity for the grb .",
    "if the electron scattering opacity is 0.4 @xmath241 g@xmath161 , as expected for a baryon dominated plasma , electron scattering is not important . for the relatively low energy burst considered here ,",
    "@xmath240 opacity is not important ( cf .",
    "piran 1996 ) .",
    "we have modeled the radio emission from sn 1998bw as the synchrotron emission from a rapidly expanding shock wave .",
    "we assumed that the electron energy and the magnetic energy densities are constant fractions of the postshock energy density , as is commonly done in models of both radio supernovae and grb afterglows .",
    "the result of our modeling is that the radio evolution is consistent with expansion into a @xmath27 circumstellar wind .",
    "the estimated wind density is consistent with that expected around the progenitor star that gave rise to the optical sn 1998bw and with the type of environment commonly deduced around radio supernovae .",
    "however , the radio light curves show a period of flux increase that appears to require an episode of impulsive energy injection .",
    "the evolution at other times is consistent with constant blast wave energy .",
    "we speculate that the freely expanding explosion ejecta are nonuniform and that a shell caught up with and energized the blast wave .",
    "katz ( 1999 ) has recently proposed a different model for rsn 1998bw in which the power for the source is provided by radioactivity .",
    "the @xmath0-rays lines from radioactivity compton scatter electrons which then move out in a mildly relativistic flow .",
    "possible problems for the model are that the @xmath242ni produced in the explosion must be mixed to the surface of the debris and the origin of the energetic electrons needed for the synchrotron emission is unclear .",
    "the association of sn 1998bw with grb 980425 appears likely based not only on the spatial and temporal coincidence of the events ( galama et al .",
    "1998b ) , but also on the unusually high energies of the optical and radio supernova phenomena .",
    "the finding that the ejecta are nonuniform gives additional evidence for a relation between the two events because the ejecta in normal radio supernovae are inferred to be approximately smoothly distributed , as expected for shock - accelerated ejecta .",
    "the optical light curve of the grb 970508 afterglow may indicate discrete structure in the ejecta ; in other grb cases , the evolution can be described by a constant energy model as is also inferred for substantial parts of the evolution of rsn 1998bw .",
    "although the environment of rsn 1998bw is similar to that inferred around normal radio supernovae , the explosion event shows a link to the more energetic grbs .",
    "woosley et al . ( 1999 ) and macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) have also linked sn 1998bw to the grbs based on the high energy of the event .",
    "the outflow may be powered by neutrino - antineutrino annihilations soon after the formation of a central black hole or by rotational energy extracted electromagnetically from a kerr black hole or its nearby accretion disk ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "cosmological grbs with well - observed afterglows , including grb 970228 ( wijers et al . 1997 ) and grb 970508 ( waxman 1997 ; granot , piran , & sari 1998 ) , have been inferred to be expanding into a medium with a low , constant density ( @xmath243 @xmath244 ) .",
    "power law declines are observed , but with a time dependence @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",
    "the steeper decline observed in rsn 1998bw ( @xmath16 ) is an important part of the evidence for expansion in a @xmath27 medium .",
    "the steeper decline is also expected for the optical and x - ray afterglows , which can account for the unusual lack of an x - ray afterglow if sn 1998bw is associated with grb 980425 .",
    "the expected early radiative losses are another factor ( bloom et al .",
    "1998 ) .    bloom et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have discussed the notion that the sn 1998bw / grb 980425 event is a prototype of a new class of grb associated with supernovae ( s - grb ) .",
    "one of the attractive features of the association was that the single pulse nature of grb 980425 could be attributed to the shock wave generated by the smooth , shock - accelerated ejecta , which are not expected to contain internal shocks . in our model ,",
    "the radio emission is driven by ejecta with considerable structure so that the association with a single pulse grb may not be significant .",
    "however , our work has brought out another suggestive distinction between the s - grb and normal grbs .",
    "rsn 1998bw shows evidence for interaction with a circumstellar wind , as expected for its massive star progenitor . in the cases where there are sufficient data to make a determination , the observations of normal grbs are consistent with interaction with a medium with a low , constant density",
    "the situation is not expected in the immediate vicinity of a massive star and may point to a different kind of progenitor object in these cases .",
