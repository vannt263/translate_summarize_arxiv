    "the lower @xmath93 in this extended disk is no longer able to expel gas as efficiently , a large component of which remains close to the galaxy and serves to both extinguish the ly@xmath16 emission ( or resonantly scatter it to larger radii ) and superimpose a zero - velocity absorption component atop the stellar continuum emission . while the growth of such extended structure is naturally associated with both evolving @xmath58 and @xmath93 , there is not a single well - defined value of either that demarcates the transition , and the mass at which extended structures may be supported can vary significantly based on the merger histories and other details of individual galaxies .",
    "in contrast , rest - frame optical size @xmath34 characterizes where the transition to an extended disk has _ already occurred_. from a phenomenological standpoint , rest - optical morphology may therefore be the most robust and accessible means of identifying systems for which feedback is less efficient at evacuating gas from the galaxy .",
    "this physical picture necessarily suggests that the zero - velocity gas feature should become more pronounced ( i.e. , @xmath99  is less strongly blueshifted ) as the contribution of rotational shear to the dynamical support of a galaxy increases .",
    "such trends have already been noted in samples of galaxies observed with either long - slit ( see figure 2 of steidel et al .",

    "( 2010 ) suggested that the anticorrelation between @xmath99  and velocity shear may be due in part to projection effects .",

    "it is therefore possible that absorption line spectroscopy of the largest galaxies is tracing _ infalling _ gas , whether from a recent merger , recycled wind accretion ( e.g. , oppenheimer et al .",

    "although similar blue wings in the low - ionization absorption line profiles indicate that galaxies of all morphological types drive comparably strong outflows at speeds up to @xmath164 @xmath6  into their surrounding environments , increasing optical half - light radius is accompanied by an increase in optical depth around the systemic redshift of the galaxy .",
    "this finding is similar in statistical significance to trends with increasing baryonic mass described recently by @xcite , but may be of physically greater importance considering the smaller sample size . while galaxies with @xmath99  differing by almost 1000 @xmath6  can have baryonic masses identical to within observational uncertainty , such galaxies have clearly distinct morphologies spanning the range from compact clumps to extended disks .",
    "the increased optical depth arises in gas nearly at rest with respect to the systemic redshift , in close physical proximity to the galaxy , and apparently corresponding to an extended disk of optical continuum light .",

    "this may be because such galaxies are in the process of transforming from clumpy , irregular systems to more regular ( albeit thick ) disks , and outflowing gas at high velocities and large distances from the galaxy may predate establishment of the disk and its corresponding polar axis .",
    "in general , our observations are consistent with inside - out growth of star forming galaxies in the young universe : ` typical ' @xmath13 star forming galaxies appear to be gas - rich , compact , triaxial systems systems that are dominated by velocity dispersion between individual star forming regions rather than systemic rotation , and whose high @xmath93 drives strong outflows into the surrounding igm .",

    "<S> we analyze rest - frame optical morphologies and gas - phase kinematics as traced by rest - frame far - uv and optical spectra for a sample of 204 star forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 drawn from the keck baryonic structure survey ( kbss ) . we find that spectroscopic properties and gas - phase kinematics are closely linked to morphology : compact galaxies with semi - major axis radii @xmath1 kpc are substantially more likely than their larger counterparts to exhibit @xmath2  in emission . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath2  emission strength varies widely within galaxies of a given morphological type , all but one of 19 galaxies with @xmath2  equivalent width @xmath3   have compact and/or multiple - component morphologies with @xmath4 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity structure of absorption lines in the galactic continuum spectra also varies as a function of morphology . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies of all morphological types drive similarly strong outflows ( as traced by the blue wing of interstellar absorption line features ) , but the outflows of larger galaxies are less highly ionized and exhibit larger optical depth at the systemic redshift that may correspond to a decreasing efficiency of feedback in evacuating gas from the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath5 @xmath6  gas is responsible both for shifting the mean absorption line redshift and attenuating @xmath7 ( via a longer resonant scattering path ) in galaxies with larger rest - optical half light radii . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to galaxies at lower redshifts , there is no evidence for a correlation between outflow velocity and inclination , suggesting that outflows from these puffy and irregular systems may be poorly collimated . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are broadly consistent with theoretical models of inside - out growth of galaxies in the young universe , in which typical @xmath8 star forming galaxies are predominantly unstable , dispersion - dominated , systems fueled by rapid gas accretion that later form extended rotationally - supported disks when stabilized by a sufficiently massive stellar component . </S>"
