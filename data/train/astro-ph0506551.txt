    "wide - area x - ray surveys have played a fundamental role in understanding the nature of the sources that populate the x - ray universe .",
    "early surveys like the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey @xcite , the rosat international x - ray / optical survey @xcite , and the asca large sky survey @xcite showed that the vast majority of the bright x - ray sources are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . more specifically , shallow wide - area surveys in the soft ( 0.52.0 kev ) x - ray band yield mostly unobscured , broad - line agns , which are characterized by a soft x - ray spectrum with a photon index of @xmath5 1.9 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , deep x - ray surveys  particularly surveys that make use of the unprecedented , sub - arsecond spatial resolution of the  x - ray observatory  find agn with harder x - ray spectra ( @xmath6 1.4 ) at fainter fluxes , more like the hard spectrum of the x - ray background .",
    "deep  surveys have thus opened a new vista on resolving the x - ray background and identifying the role and evolution of accretion power in all galaxies .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background is now almost completely resolved ( @xmath7 7090% ) into discrete sources in the deep , pencil beam surveys like the  deep fields ( cdf - n , @xcite ; cdf - s , @xcite ) .",
    "to understand the composition of the sources that make up the x - ray background , population synthesis models have been constructed @xcite which typically require approximately 3 times as many obscured agn as traditional type 1 ( unobscured ) agn .    while the deep fields provide the deepest view of the x - ray universe and have generated plentiful agn samples at lower luminosities , the small area covered by pencil - beam surveys means luminous sources are poorly sampled . in an attempt to determine the luminosity function of x - ray emitting agn up to @xmath8 , as well as to leverage existing deep multiwavelength data in the extended @xmath9 field centered on the cdf - s , the region surrounding the cdf - s",
    "was recently observed by @xmath10 .",
    "covering @xmath0 1100 square arcminutes ( @xmath0 0.3 deg@xmath1 ) , the extended  deep field - south ( ecdfs ) survey is the largest  survey field at this depth ( @xmath0 230 ks ) , and is the second deepest and widest survey ever conducted in the x - rays ( the xmm - newton survey of the lockman hole is deeper in the hard band and has @xmath7 30% more area ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present the x - ray catalog for the ecdfs and the number counts in two energy bands . in subsequent papers",
    ", we will present the optical and near - ir properties of these x - ray sources , including first results from our deep optical spectroscopy campaign obtained as part of the one - square - degree multiwavelength survey by yale / chile ( musyc ) @xcite .    in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our data reduction procedure . in section 3",
    ", we describe the point source detection and astrometry . the x - ray source catalog and basic survey results",
    "are presented in section 4 and the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the average galactic column density along this line of sight for the four pointings is @xmath11  @xmath12 @xcite . @xmath13",
    "km  s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are adopted throughout this paper which is consistent with the cosmological parameters reported by @xcite .",
    "all coordinates throughout this paper are j2000 .",
    "all nine observations of the ecdfs survey field were conducted with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on - board the  x - ray observatory as part of the approved guest observer program in cycle 5 ( proposal number 05900218  pi niel brandt ; @xcite ) .",
    "acis consists of 10 ccds , distributed in a 2@xmath172 array ( acis - i ) and a 1@xmath176 array ( acis - s ) .",
    "all 4 of the acis - i ccds are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ; 2 of the 6 acis - s ccds are back - illuminated ccds ( s1 and s3 ) . of these 10 ccds ,",
    "at most 6 can be operated at any one time .",
    "table  [ tbl - diary ] presents a journal of the  observations of the ecdfs .",
    "all nine observations were conducted in very faint mode ( see the proposers guide , pg .",
    "95 ) so that the pixel values of the @xmath18 event island are telemetered rather than just the @xmath19 event island as in faint mode .",
    "this telemetry format offers the advantage of further reducing the instrument background after ground processing ( see section 2.2 ) . observation ids ( obsids ) 50195022 and 6164 also had the acis - s2 ccd powered on ( see table  [ tbl - diary ] ) .",
    "however , due to the large off - axis angle of the s2 ccd during these observations , it has a much broader point spread function ( psf ) and hence lower sensitivity so we exclude data from this ccd and focus only on data collected from the acis - i ccds .",
    "the on - axis ccd for each acis - i observation is i3 and the acis - i field of view is @xmath20 .",
    "all data were re - processed using the latest version of the  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ; version 3.2.1 ; released 10 february 2005 ) software as well as version 3.0.0 of the calibration database ( caldb ; released 12 december 2004 ) .",
    "we chose to re - reduce all nine datasets rather than simply use the standard data processing ( sdp ) level 2 event files because we wanted the datasets to be reduced in a consistent manner , and more importantly , we wanted to take advantage of better  x - ray center ( cxc ) algorithms to reduce the acis particle background by using the information located in the outer 16 pixels of the @xmath18 event island , as well as executing a new script that is much more efficient at identifying acis `` hot pixels '' and cosmic ray afterglow events .",
    "this new hot pixel and cosmic ray afterglow tool is now implemented in the standard data processing pipeline at the cxc but was not applied in the sdp pipeline of the present observations .",
    "the following procedure was used to arrive at a new level 2 event file . before applying the new ciao tool to identify acis hot pixels and cosmic ray afterglow events , the pixels identified in the cxc - provided level 1 event file as being due to a cosmic ray afterglow event",
    "were reset .",
    "an afterglow is the residual charge from the interaction of a cosmic ray in a front - side illuminated ccd frame .",
    "some of the excess charge is captured by charge traps created by the radiation damage suffered early in the mission ( see @xcite and references therein ) and released over the next few to a few dozen frames .",
    "if these afterglow events are not removed from the data , they can result in the spurious detection of faint sources .",
    "to better account for such events , a new , more precise method for identifying afterglow events was developed by the cxc and has now been introduced into the standard data processing pipeline .",
    "this ciao tool , `` acis_run_hotpix , '' was then run on the reset level 1 event file to identify and flag hot pixels and afterglow events in all 9 acis observations of the ecdfs .",
    "the last step in producing the new level 2 event file was to run the ciao tool `` acis_process_events . ''",
    "in addition to applying the newest gain map supplied in the latest release of the caldb , this tool also applies the pixel randomization and the acis charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction .",
    "the latter corrects the data for radiation damage sustained by the ccds early in the mission .",
    "all of these corrections are part of the standard data processing and are on by default in acis_process_events .",
    "the time - dependent gain correction is also applied to the event list to correct the pulse - invariant ( pi ) energy channel for the secular drift in the average pulse - height amplitude ( pha ) values .",
    "this drift is caused primarily by gradual degradation of the cti of the acis ccds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the observation - specific bad pixel map created by `` acis_run_hotpix '' was supplied , and the option to clean the acis particle background by making use of the additional pixels telemetered in very faint mode was turned on .    once a new level 2 event file was produced , we applied the standard grade filtering to each observation , choosing only event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ( the standard _ asca _  grade set ) , and the standard good time intervals supplied by the sdp pipeline .",
    "we also restrict the energy range to 0.58.0 kev , as the background rises steeply below and above those limits .",
    "lastly , we examined the background light curves for all 9 observations as the acis background is known to vary significantly .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the front - illuminated ccds can show typical increases of 1 - 5 cts s@xmath14 above the quiescent level , while the back - illuminated ccds can show large excursions  as high as 100 cts s@xmath14 above the quiescent level  during background flares .",
    "the durations of these intervals of enhanced background are highly variable , ranging from 500 s to 10@xmath21 s. the cause of these background flares is currently not known ( see @xcite ) ; however , they may be caused by low - energy protons ( @xmath22100 kev ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the time periods corresponding to these background flares are generally excised from the data before proceeding with further analysis although not always ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the source detection probability depends strongly on the background rate . to examine our observations for such periods",
    ", we used the ciao script analyse_ltcrv.sl which identifies periods where the background is @xmath233@xmath24 above the mean .",
    "all 9 observations were filtered according to this prescription ( see table  [ tbl - diary ] for a comparison of raw exposure time vs. filtered exposure time ) , resulting in only @xmath740.6 ks ( @xmath74% ) being lost due to background flares ( 954.2 ks vs. 913.6 ks ) . of this ,",
    "20.3 ks were excluded from the end of obsid 5017 due to a flare in which the count rate increased by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "table  [ table - exp ] lists the net exposure time for each of the 4 pointings used to image the ecdfs region .",
    "the net exposure time for each of the 4 pointings varies from a low of 205 ks to a high of 239 ks , with the mean net exposure time for the entire survey field of 228 ks .",
    "these extra steps in processing help remove spurious sources and result in fewer catalog sources than if the standard processing or pipeline products were used .",
    "in this paper , we report on the sources detected in three standard x - ray bands ( see table  [ table - defn ] ) : 0.58.0 kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0 kev ( soft band ) , and 2.08.0 kev ( hard band ) . the raw acis resolution is 0.492 arcsec pixel@xmath14 , however , source detection and flux determinations were performed on the block 4 images , _",
    "i.e. , _ 1.964 arcsec pixel@xmath14 , as the source detect tool and exposure map generation require significant computer resources for full size images ; for greater accuracy , source positions were determined from the block 1 images .",
    "observations at each of the four pointings were combined via the ciao script `` merge_all . ''",
    "this script was executed using ciao version 2.3 because of a known bug in the `` asphist '' tool under ciao version 3.2.1 ; this bug results in incorrect exposure maps for the merged image . at each pointing , the observation with the longest integration time was used for co - ordinate registration .",
    "for example , when merging obsids 5015 and 5016 , the merged event list was registered to obsid 5015 as it has approximately twice the integration time as 5016 .",
    "table  [ table - exp ] lists the obsids for each pointing , as well as the raw and the net integration time . for each pointing",
    ", we constructed images in the three standard bands : 0.58.0 kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0 kev ( soft band ) , and 2.08.0 kev ( hard band ) ; see table  [ table - defn ] . the full band exposure - corrected image for the entire survey field )",
    "are available from http://www.astro.yale.edu / svirani / ecdfs/. ] is presented in figure  [ full ] .",
    "we constructed exposure maps in these three energy bands for each pointing and for the entire survey field ) are available from http://www.astro.yale.edu / svirani / ecdfs/. ] .",
    "these exposure maps were created in the standard way and are normalized to the effective exposure of a source location at the aim point .",
    "the procedure used to create these exposure maps accounts for the effects of vignetting , gaps between the ccds , bad column filtering , and bad pixel filtering .",
    "however , it should be noted that charge blooms caused by cosmic rays can reduce the detector efficiency by as much as few percent .",
    "there is currently no way to account for such charge cascades ; however , when a tool becomes available , we will correct for this effect as necessary and make the new exposure maps publicly available at the world wide site listed in footnote 7 .",
    "the exposure maps were binned by 4 so that they were congruent to the final reduced images . a photon index of @xmath25  =  1.4 , the slope of the x - ray background in the 0.58.0 kev band ( e.g. @xcite ) was used in creating these exposure maps .",
    "in order to calculate the survey area as a function of the x - ray flux in the soft and hard bands , we used the exposure maps generated for each band and assumed a fixed detection threshold of 5 counts in the soft band and 2.5 in the hard band ( @xmath72@xmath24 ) . dividing these counts by the exposure map",
    ", we obtain the flux limit at each pixel for each band . the pixel area",
    "is then converted into a solid angle and the cumulative histogram of the flux limit is constructed ( figure  [ area ] ) .",
    "the total survey area is @xmath0 1100 arcmin@xmath1 ( @xmath0 0.3 deg@xmath1 ) .",
    "a more precise method of determining the survey area as a function of the x - ray flux is described by @xcite ; however , this would affect only the faint tail of the sample and would not significantly alter the present results .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated treatment is deferred to a later paper .      to perform x - ray source detection",
    ", we applied the ciao wavelet detection algorithm _",
    "although several other methods have been used in other survey fields to find sources in  observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we chose _",
    "wavdetect _ to allow a straightforward comparison between sources found in our catalog with those found in the cdf - s @xcite . moreover , _",
    "wavdetect _ is more robust in detecting individual sources in crowded fields and in identifying extended sources than the other ciao detection algorithm , _",
    "celldetect_. point - source detection was performed in each standard band ( see table  [ table - defn ] ) using a `` @xmath26  sequence '' of wavelet scales ; scales of 1 , @xmath26 , 2 , @xmath27 , 4 , @xmath28 , and 8 pixels were used .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed that using larger scales can detect a few additional sources at large off - axis angles but found that this `` @xmath26  sequence '' gave the best overall performance across the cdf - n field .",
    "moreover , as @xcite point out , sources found with larger scales tend to have source properties and positions too poorly defined to give useful results .",
    "our criterion for source detection is that a source must be found with a false - positive probability threshold ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath30 in at least one of the three standard bands .",
    "this false - positive probability threshold is typical for point - source catalogs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although @xcite found that a significance threshold parameter of @xmath31 gave the most efficient results in the  multiwavelength project ( champ ) survey .",
    "wavdetect _ using both probability thresholds and found that using the lower significance threshold ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath31 ) results in only an additional 64 unique sources . visual inspection of each of these sources suggest they are bona fide x - ray sources .",
    "however , because these are sources found with the lower significance threshold , we present them in a separate table ( the secondary catalog ; table  [ cat2 ] ) .",
    "the primary catalog ( table  [ cat ] ) is a compilation of 587 unique sources found using the higher significance threshold in at least one of the three energy bands . for the remaining source detection parameters",
    ", we used the default values specified in ciao which included requiring that a minimum of 10% of the on - axis exposure was needed in a pixel before proceeding to analyze it .",
    "we also applied the exposure maps generated for each pointing ( see section 3.1 ) to mitigate finding spurious sources which are most often located at the edge of the field of view .",
    "the number of spurious sources per pointing is approximately @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total number of pixels in the image , according to the _ wavdetect _ documentation .",
    "since there are approximately 2 @xmath17 10@xmath34 pixels in each image for each pointing , we expect @xmath70.2 spurious sources per pointing per band for a probability threshold of @xmath30 . therefore , treating the 12 images searched as independent , we expect @xmath7 2 - 3 false sources in our primary catalog ( table  [ cat ] ) for the case of a uniform background .",
    "of course the background is neither perfectly uniform nor static as the level decreases in the gaps between the ccds and increases slightly near bright point sources . as mentioned by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", one might expect the number of false sources to be increased by a factor of @xmath7 23 due to the large variation in effective exposure time across the field and the increase in background near bright sources due to the point - spread function ( psf ) wings .",
    "but our false - source estimate is likely to be conservative by a similar factor since _",
    "wavdetect _ suppresses fluctuations on scales smaller than the psf .",
    "that is , a single pixel is unlikely to be considered a source detection cell  particularly at large off - axis angles @xcite .",
    "the source lists generated by the procedure above for each of the standard bands in each of the pointings of the ecdfs were merged to create the point - source catalogs presented in tables  [ cat ] and  [ cat2 ] .",
    "the source positions listed in each catalog are the full band _ wavdetect_-determined positions except when the source was detected only in the soft or hard bands . to identify the same source in the different energy bands , a matching radius of 2.5 or twice the psf size of each detect cell , whichever was the largest , was used . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite used a matching radius of 2.5 for sources within 6  of the aimpoint , and 4.0 for sources with larger off - axis angles . with our method ,",
    "9 and 3 soft- and hard - band sources , respectively , have more than 1 counterpart , so we took the closest one .",
    "note that both tables  [ cat ] and  [ cat2 ] excludes sources found by _",
    "wavdetect _ in which one or both of the axes of the `` source ellipse '' collapsed to zero . over the survey field ,",
    "70 such sources are found ; in general , these are unusual sources and although the formal probability of being spurious is low , there may be problems with these detections .",
    "@xcite found that using the _ wavdetect_-determined counts for such objects as we do results in a gross underestimate of the number of counts even though the source was detected with a probability threshold of @xmath30 . since these sources would appear in catalogs that do circular aperture photometry instead , we present this list in a separate catalog ( table  [ cat3 ] ) for completeness .    below we define the columns in tables  [ cat ] and  [ cat2 ] , our primary and secondary source catalogs for the ecdfs survey .",

    "to determine source counts for each of our sources , we extracted counts in the standard bands from each of the images using the geometry of the _ wavdetect _ source cell and the _ wavdetect_-determined source position .",
    "for example , to determine the counts in the soft band , we used the position and geometry determined by _ wavdetect _ in the soft band image to extract soft band counts .",
    "some studies use circular aperature photometry to extract sources counts .",
    "however , as both @xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ; see their figure 5 ) demonstrate , both techniques generally return the same result .",

    "neither the cdf - s nor the ecdfs sources were corrected for intrinsic galactic absorption .",

    ", the difference can be explained by the different treatment of the contamination layer , which is particularly important in the soft band . the @xcite catalog used acisabs to correct their fluxes for the presence of a contamination layer in the acis instrument .",
    "this tool assumes a spatially - uniform contamination layer composed of hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen .",
    "however , recent analysis of grating data @xcite shows that the amount of contamination correction depends on the spatial position on the instrument , and that the actual composition of the contamination is hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , and fluorine ( p. plucinsky , priv .",
    "these two new discoveries may have caused @xcite to underestimate the contamination correction , thus making their fluxes lower in the soft band .",
    "in the hard band , the discrepancy can be explained by our assumed value of @xmath46 1.4 for the spectral slope to calculate fluxes , while @xcite used individual spectral fits for most of these overlapping sources .",
    "we conclude that the fluxes are broadly consistent and that systematic uncertainties in their average values are @xmath7 15% , although individual fluxes have larger uncertainties ( and some agn may have actually varied ) .",
    "we performed extensive xspec and marx simulations to investigate the statistical properties of the catalog , its completeness , and its flux limits .",

    "we then computed their count rates in a typical ecdfs pointing ( @xmath7 230 ks ) . using a fixed photon slope of @xmath25=1.4 to compute fluxes then results in systematic flux errors of @xmath7 10% in both the hard and soft bands .    to investigate the completeness of our catalog",
    ", we used marx to simulate x - ray images of sources with known properties , including the range of count rates from just below our threshold to just above our highest count rate , and a generous range of spectral slopes ( 1 @xmath47 2 ) drawn from the observed @xmath25 distribution observed in the 1 ms cdfs survey @xcite .",
    "we positioned 1000 sources of known fluxes ( consistent with an exposure time of @xmath7 230 ks ) randomly within the ecdfs survey field , so the background and noise properties of the data are real .",
    "we then analyzed these simulated data with the same procedures used on the real ecdfs data ; that is , we performed source detection on the resulting event list via _",
    "wavdetect_. this resulted in @xmath790% of the sources being recovered overall , with incompleteness becoming important below @xmath72@xmath48  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 and @xmath72@xmath49  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 , in the soft and hard bands , respectively .",
    "we found 651 unique sources in the extended  deep field - south survey field , which spans @xmath0 0.3 deg@xmath1 on the sky .",
    "of these , 561 were detected in the 0.58.0 kev full band , 529 in the 0.52.0 kev soft band , and 335 in the 2.08.0 kev hard band .",
    "there are 9 hard - band sources that are not detected in either the soft or full bands , 81 soft - band sources are not detected in either the hard or full bands , and 56 full - band sources are not detected in either the soft or hard bands ( see table  [ tbl - sourcesummary2 ] ) . of the 335 hard - band sources ,",
    "83 were not detected in the soft band ( @xmath720% ) ; these are candidates for highly absorbed sources . of the 529 and 335 sources detected in the soft and hard bands , respectively , 118 and 73 are detected in the cdf - s itself . over this 0.11 deg@xmath1 area , with an exposure time of @xmath7 1 ms , @xcite found 346 unique sources , of which 307 were detected in the 0.52.0 kev band and 251 in the 210 kev band . in the cdf - n , with an area similar to the cdf - s but with twice the exposure , @xcite found 503 x - ray sources in the 2 ms exposure .",
    "the number of sources found in the ecdfs is consistent with these two pencil beam surveys , given an approximate slope of unity for the x - ray counts in this flux range .    the cumulative distribution of sources for the soft and hard bands is shown in figure  [ lognlogs ] .",
    "error bars for a given bin were calculated by adding in quadrature the error bars from the previous bin to the 84% confidence error bars appropriate to the additional number of sources in the present bin , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the observed distribution is compared to the compilation of @xcite and to the @xmath50  n@xmath50  s for the  deep fields reported by @xcite . in the soft band",
    "there is very good agreement with the comparison sample in the flux range from @xmath51 to @xmath52  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 . at the bright end , the discrepancy is not statistically significant , @xmath71@xmath24 , because there are few bright x - ray sources in our field . at fluxes below @xmath72@xmath48  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 ,",
    "the observed @xmath50  n@xmath50  s in the ecdfs flattens relative to the comparison samples because of incompleteness near the flux limit .",
    "sources with soft fluxes of @xmath532@xmath54  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 are only detected at the @xmath53 2@xmath24 level , and thus not all sources will be recovered .",
    "the @xmath50  n@xmath50  s relation for the hard band is shown in the right panel of figure  [ lognlogs ] and is compared again with the distributions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used 2 - 10  kev instead of 2 - 8  kev for the hard band . to convert 2 - 10  kev fluxes to the 2 - 8  kev band",
    ", we used a factor of 0.8 , corresponding to the flux conversion assuming a @xmath25=1.4 spectral slope .",
    "@xcite quote 2 - 8 kev but appear to have used 2 - 10 kev , so we also converted their fluxes by the same factor ( which reproduces their curve in figure 4 of their paper ) .",
    "as in the soft band , very good agreement with previously reported @xmath50  n@xmath50  s relations is seen for the 4@xmath55 to 2@xmath56  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath14 range , and again , incompleteness at the faint end explains the observed discrepancy .    the differential @xmath50",
    "n@xmath50  s for both the soft and hard bands is shown in figure  [ hist_flux ] .",
    "these observed distributions are compared to the predictions of the agn population synthesis model of @xcite which explains the x - ray background as a superposition of mostly obscured agn .",
    "this model also explains the multiwavelength number counts of agn in the  deep fields @xcite .",
    "given that these models match very well to the observed cumulative flux distributions from existing surveys , it is not surprising that this model also successfully explains the @xmath50  n@xmath50  s distributions in the ecdfs field .",
    "discrepancies can be found only at the fainter end , where incompleteness causes the number of observed sources to fall below the model prediction .",
    "one of the early  results was the finding that fainter x - ray sources have in general harder spectra @xcite , represented by higher values of the hardness ratio .",
    "figure  [ hr_rate ] shows that this effect is also observed in the ecdfs field , for a much larger number of sources .",
    "this trend is explained by obscuration since the soft band count rate is relatively more affected than the hard band , creating a harder observed x - ray spectrum while at the same time reducing the observed soft flux .",
    "this is in accordance with the general picture of agn unification , although the precise geometry is not constrained , and it is as expected from population synthesis models ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) which require a large number of obscured agn at moderate redshift to explain the spectral shape of the x - ray background .",
    "we present here the x - ray properties of sources detected in deep  observations of the ecdfs field , the largest  survey ever performed in terms of both area and depth .",
    "this survey covers a total of 0.3 square degrees , roughly 3 times the area of each very deep  deep field .",
    "a total of 651 unique sources were detected in the four acis - i pointings in this field ; 81 sources were detected in the soft but not in the full band , while 9 were detected only in the hard band .",
    "roughly 15% of these 651 unique sources  118 sources in the soft band and 73 in the hard band  were previously detected in the cdf - s .",
    "the fluxes derived for these sources agree well with the fluxes obtained from the cdf - s observations .",
    "the x - ray @xmath50  n@xmath50  s in the soft and hard bands agree well with those derived from other x - ray surveys and with predictions of the most recent agn population synthesis models for the x - ray background .",
    "as first discovered in early deep  observations , we find in this sample that faint x - ray sources have in general harder spectra , indicating that these sources are likely obscured agn at moderate redshifts .",
    "this is predicted by agn unification models that explain the properties of the x - ray background .",
    "a future paper will discuss the optical and near - ir properties of these objects .",
    "this field was observed with the _ spitzer _ space telescope by the mips gto team and will also be observed by _",
    "spitzer _ as part of an approved program related to the musyc survey ( pi : p. van dokkum ) .",
    "the source catalogs and images presented in this paper are available in electronic format on the world wide web ( http://www.astro.yale.edu/svirani/ecdfs )",
    ". we will continue to improve the source catalog as better calibration information , analysis methods , and software become available .",
    "for example , we plan to optimize the searching for variable sources and to study the multiwavelength properties of these x - ray sources",
    ".    note : after this paper was submitted , another catalog paper by @xcite appeared on astro - ph .",
    "our catalogs are similar but the analysis assumptions are different and therefore the source catalogs differ , as do the papers .",
