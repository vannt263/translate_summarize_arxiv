    "the experiments of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) , collisions of gold nuclei at 200 gev per nucleon have produced a strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp)@xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has yielded many important insights into the dynamics of strongly - coupled gauge theories .",
    "it has been used to investigate the hydrodynamical transport quantities in the various interesting strongly - coupled gauge theories where the perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "methods based on ads / cft relate the gravity in @xmath0 space to the conformal field theory on the 4-dimensional boundary .",
    "it has been shown that an ads space with a black brane is dual to conformal field theory at finite temperature .",
    "specially , dynamics of open strings on a @xmath0 black brane background is related to the quarks in the large n and large t hooft coupling limit of 4-dimensional the cft dual theory at finite temperature .",
    "then one can calculate energy loss of quarks to the surrounding strongly - coupled plasma .",
    "+ one of the interesting properties of the strongly - coupled plasma at rhic is jet quenching of partons produced with high transverse momentum .",
    "the jet quenching parameter controls the description of relativistic partons and it is possible to employ the gauge / gravity duality and determine this quantity at the finite temperature theories .",
    "there has been the ads / cft calculation of jet quenching parameter @xcite and the drag coefficient which describes the energy loss for heavy quarks in @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "+ the universality of the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath2 to entropy density @xmath3 @xcite for all gauge theories with einstein gravity dual raised the tantalizing prospect of a connection between string theory and rhic .",
    "the results were obtained for a class of gauge theories whose holographic duals are dictated by classical einstein gravity .",
    "but string theory contains higher derivative corrections from stringy or quantum effects , such corrections correspond to @xmath4 and @xmath5 corrections . in the case of @xmath1 super yang - mills theory",
    ", the gravity dual corresponds to type @xmath6 string theory on @xmath7 background .",
    "the leading order corrections in @xmath4 arises from the stringy corrections to the low energy effective action of type @xmath6 supergravity , @xmath8 .",
    "such corrections to the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath2 to entropy density @xmath3 was calculated in @xcite .",
    "+ recently , the calculation of @xmath9 for higher derivative gravity has been done by @xcite . in @xcite , they compute the effect of general @xmath10 corrections to the gravitational action in ads space and show that the conjecture low bound on the @xmath9 can be violated .",
    "the computations of this ratio in an effective five - dimensional setting have been discussed in @xcite .",

    "we do not limit our study to specific known string theory corrections , and consider the generic higher derivative terms in the holographic gravity dual .",
    "in general , we do not know about forms of higher derivative corrections in string theory , but it has been known that by string landscape one expects that generic corrections can occur .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate finite - coupling corrections to the drag force on a moving heavy quark in the super yang - mills plasma using ads / cft . these corrections are related to curvature - squared corrections in the corresponding gravity dual .",
    "it is shown that curvature - squared corrections affect the drag force . however , we do not predict effect of them on the cft dual theory . because curvature - squared corrections are not the first higher derivative corrections in type @xmath6 superstring theory .",
    "the corrections to the drag force depend on the velocity of heavy quark .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "1 that there is a critical velocity ( @xmath11 ) such that for @xmath12 the corrections increase the drag force .",
    "this phenomena might be important because at @xmath11 curvature - squared corrections have the minimum effects to the drag force .",

    "an external quark can be introduced by a string that has a single end point at the boundary and extends down to the horizon .",

    "it is important to point out that the first higher derivative correction in weakly curved type iib backgrounds enters at order @xmath20 , and not @xmath10 , so we will not predict effect of curvature - squared corrections on the @xmath1 su(n ) sym .",
