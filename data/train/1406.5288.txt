    "in the last decade the investigation of the subluminal light propagation have made a noise in the world thanks to its possible applications on quantnum memory , high - speed optical switches , optical delay lines and optical communication @xcite and practical applications in optical delay lines @xcite .",
    "for the first time , hau _ et al _ observed in a ultracold gas of sodium atoms a subluminal group velocity as low as 17 m / s using the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "et al _ showed , with the aid of eit , that the light can be stopped in a magnetically trapped , cold cloud of sodium atoms @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies showed that eit is responsible for the light storage and , therefore , the possibility to use light as quantum memory @xcite . the same eit was the tool used to acquire the light storage for times greater than a second in a solid praseodymium doped in y~2~sio~5~ @xcite.wu and deng reported ultraslow optical solitons in a cold four - state medium @xcite .",
    "wang _ et al _ used gain - assisted linear anomalous dispersion to demonstrate the superluminal group velocity in atomic caesium gas @xcite , and they showed that the group velocity can exceed the speed of light in vacuum and even become negative .",
    "the superluminal or negative group velocity respects the causality being thought of as a pulse - reshaping phenomenon @xcite and its inverse has a physical significance in connection with the flow energy in light pulses @xcite , unbraking the relativity theory principle which stipulates that the maximum speed is the light speed _ c _ ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the control of the group velocity can be accomplished through the electromagnetically induced transparency and electromagnetically induced amplification @xcite .",
    "based on the @xmath1 scheme , with the lower levels coupled by a field , proposed by agarwal _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the experiments carried out on the single atomic transition of the cs atomic vapour @xcite and rb atomic vapour @xcite with a standing - wave coupling field have shown the change from subluminal to superluminal group velocity .",
    "the spontaneously generated coherence appears as a result of quantum interference produced by spontaneous decay .",
    "for the first time javanien @xcite shows the possibility for a @xmath1 system with near - degenerated levels to achieve a spontaneously generated coherence ( sgc ) , as a superposition of two receiving states of the spontaneous emission from a single excited state .",
    "effects of the sgc on the group velocity was studied for closed three level @xmath1 systems with incoherent pump fields @xcite and with a strong coupling field , weak probe field and incoherent pump field @xcite .",
    "et al _ considered a three - level @xmath1-type system from the lih molecule @xcite .",
    "we will study a three - level v - type system built from other states of lih molecule than those used in above mentioned paper .",
    "the subluminal or superluminal group velocity appears in a v - type system with spontaneously generated coherence in the presence of an incoherent pump field @xcite and without it @xcite . in the case of a weak probe field it was determined the relative phase related to the parameters of the specific system for which the group velocity of the weak probe field is reduced and the probe pulse had undistorted shape @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the group velocity on the incoherent pumping rate was studied in the presence of the sgc and in its absence , but without phase dependence @xcite .",
    "et al _ observed a positive group velocity in the absence of the incoherent pump field and a negative group velocity in its presence .",
    "the relative phase of the probe and coupling fields can switch the group velocity of the probe field between the subluminal and superluminal range in a v - type system without incoherent pumping field @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply our general analytical formulas , without constraints on system parameters , from our previous work @xcite to obtain the analytical formula of the probe field group velocity for a closed three level v - type system with spontaneously generated coherence in the presence of an incoherent pumping field .",
    "we study also another kind of a three - level v - type system in which the all three fields , the probe , the coupling and the incoherent pumping fields drive both optical allowed transitions . this system was not studied before to the best our knowledge . in this case , the density matrix system equations are solved numerically for a closed three - level v - type system from lih molecule built using the external field method @xcite , a real v - type system which was studied by us from the point of view of amplification without population inversion and high refractive index without absorption @xcite .",
    "consequently our results can be applied to a real molecular system which can be used in an experiment .",
    "a short description of both theoretical systems and their evolution in the density matrix formalism is presented in section [ sec:2 ] , which has two subsections [ sec:2.1 ] and [ sec:2.2 ] .",
    "the subsection [ sec:2.1 ] is devoted to the three - level v - type system where the probe and coupling fields drive only one transition , while in subsection [ sec:2.2 ] we present the other kind of three - level v - type system in which the three fields act on both transitions .",
    "we achieve the expression of the probe field group velocity in section [ sec:3 ] for the two kinds of the v - type system in two subsections .",
    "the analytical formula of the group velocity for the first kind of a threee - level v - type system is obtained in subsection [ sec:3.1 ] while subsection [ sec:3.2 ] is devoted to the formula of the probe field velocity for the v - type system of the second kind . in the section [ sec:4 ]",

    "the index of refraction is related to the real part of dielectric susceptibility of the medium @xmath73 by the relation @xmath74 in si .",
    "consequently the group velocity depends on the dielectric susceptibility @xmath75 we can use a more confortable quantity , named group index @xmath76 . if @xmath77 then group velocity is lower than the vacuum speed velocity and the field has a subluminal group velocity .",
    "otherwise , @xmath78 , and the field has a superluminal group velocity .      for the three level v - type system of the first kind the susceptibility of the medium at the probe field is proportional with the density matrix element @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the density of the v - type systems and @xmath82 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity . from relations ( [ ec3 ] ) , ( [ ec4 ] ) and our prior analytical results of the density matrix element @xmath79 @xcite , we derive the quantity @xmath83 @xmath84 starting from the expression ( 4 ) of @xmath85 and the relations which are detailed in the appendix of the previous paper @xcite is straightforward to obtain the analytical expression of @xmath86 .",

    "the change of the relative phase @xmath111 leads to the periodically transition of the group velocity from the subluminal ( @xmath113 ) to superluminal ( @xmath114 ) regimen .",
    "the graphics for the probe field detuning with opposite signs are dephased with @xmath115 .    from figure [ fig2](a )",
    "we observe that the highest values of the index group are obtained for the detuning of the probe field given by the frequency formula of the dressed state @xmath116 from the relation ( [ ec13bis ] ) , @xmath117 . the group index @xmath110 for the probe field detuning @xmath118 is of the order @xmath119 while for the other values of the probe field detuning is lower with two order of magnitude .",

    "we can observe from the figures [ fig4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) that the group index is oposite in sign for relative phase oposite in sign , i.e. @xmath137 .",

    "let us apply a strong field between @xmath139 and @xmath140 states of the lih molecule ( see figure [ fig5 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "it then produces the dressed states @xmath141 with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the real rabi frequency of the strong coupling field and @xmath145 the detuning of the strong laser frequency from the molecular transition @xmath146 @xcite .",
