    "near - infrared observations of stars near our galaxy s central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) have revealed a larger number of young , massive stars than can be explained by typical star formation models  @xcite .",
    "this  paradox of youth\"@xcite has pointed to the development of a possible continuing top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) in the region near the central smbh  @xcite .",
    "a top - heavy imf near sgr  a * would imply the existence of a large number of neutron stars in close proximity to the central smbh .",
    "current estimates suggest that there could be @xmath0 neutron stars within 1pc of sgr  a *  @xcite and possibly @xmath1 pulsars within @xmath2pc of sgr a *  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions have also suggested a cusp of @xmath3 neutron stars in the central parsec of our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations have been consistent with this number of neutron stars  @xcite but appear to have ruled out the presence of a larger number of neutron stars ( e.g. , 40,000 ) . for this paper",
    ", we will take the results from @xcite and will assume the existence of 1000 pulsars within 0.01pc of sgr  a*. we will also follow pfahl & loeb in assuming that @xmath4 , the density of pulsars as a function of distance from the galactic center , falls off as @xmath5 , so that @xmath6 with this assumption it will turn out that the quantity of greatest importance to our predictions is the number of pulsars at distances from the central smbh between 0.001pc and 0.01pc .    in this paper we will consider the possibility that an appropriate program to monitor pulsar beams from sgr  a * would detect a beam that is strongly deflected by the central smbh .",
    "such a system would be of great interest , as precision timing of the radio pulses from such a system would measure the properties of the spacetime through which they propagate .",
    "preliminary work in the case of schwarzschild black holes , presented in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) , has revealed a rich structure and multiplicity of pulses observed in such geometries ; subsequent work will look at how pulse timing can be used to measure properties such as the mass and spin of the smbh , and measure or constrain deviations in the higher multipoles of the spacetime from the predictions of general relativity . in the present paper we will focus on determining the likelihood of observing a pulsar in such a configuration . to do this",
    "we will first calculate the probability that a single pulsar , in orbit around the central smbh , emits a signal in such a way that it is strongly deflected by the central smbh , and reaches the earth . from this",
    "we then infer the probability that the signal from one of the assumed number of pulsars is strongly deflected , reaches the earth , and is detectable by radio telescopes .",
    "the paper continues in sec .",
    "[ sec : bg ] with a discussion of the model for the pulsar - smbh system , and with assumptions about pulsar characteristics and telescope sensitivities .",
    "the heart of the paper is the method of computation of probabilities in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] we conclude that an observing program , even with current radio telescopes , would have _ some _ chance of detecting strongly - bent pulsar emissions , while later generations of telescopes will significantly increase the likelihood of observing these fascinating systems .",
    "as a simplification in our probability estimates we take the smbh in sgr  a * to be a schwarzschild hole .",
    "it is essentially certain , of course , that the smbh is rotating , but the angular momentum @xmath7 is currently thought to be only about half of its maximum possible value of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the smbh @xcite . typically , the astrophysical properties of kerr holes differ significantly from those of schwarzshcild holes only when @xmath7 is very close to @xmath8 .",
    "our preliminary investigations of kerr holes , in work now underway , confirms this .",
    "while frame dragging by the black hole may slightly increase the probability of detecting beams bent in the prograde sense , and decrease the probability of retrograde - bent beams , these effects largely cancel when considering the population as a whole .",
    "thus the schwarzschild approximation would appear to be justified for our purposes , in which it is the average properties that are of importance .     and @xmath10 .",
    "]    we will rely heavily on results in papers  i and  ii for pulsar beam deflection around a schwarzschild hole . in those papers",
    "@xmath11 is the angle between the direction of pulsar emission and the direction radially outward from the central smbh at the emission event ; the angle @xmath12 is the angle between that same radial direction and the direction in which the pulsar beam is moving when it is asymptotically far from the smbh , as sketched in figure  [ fig : photonorbit ] . in the absence of the bending of the beam , the two angles @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 would be equal .",
    "the effect of curvature of the beam is encoded in the function @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance of the emission point from the smbh . the computational method for finding the @xmath15 function",
    "is discussed in papers  i and  ii .",
    "a practical approximation for @xmath15 , useful for the considerations of this paper , is presented in the appendix .        with the simplification to a nonrotating smbh",
    ", we do not need to consider any angle between the orbit of the pulsar and the spin axis of the smbh , the geometric parameters of interest are pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the inclination of the _ pulsar _ spin axis with respect to the orbital plane is denoted @xmath18 ; the beam of pulsar emission is taken to have its center at angle @xmath19 from the spin axis , and to have width angular width @xmath20 , so that the pulsar emission is confined between conical surfaces with opening angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we will assume that there is no favored alignment of the pulsar spin axis with the pulsar orbital plane , and will take @xmath18 to be uniformly distributed over the sky . within a fraction of a pc from the central smbh",
    ", we expect there to be no significant alignment of the neutron star population with the disk of the galaxy , so we will take the orientation of the orbital plane also to be randomly distributed over the sphere .",
    "we will assume the angle @xmath19 , between the pulsar beam and the spin axis to be randomly distributed over the half sphere , and we assume that for every choice of @xmath19 there is also a beam at @xmath23 .",
    "( in our probability estimates , we will avoid double counting in the case that @xmath24 and the conical regions of the two beams overlap . )        the angular width @xmath25 of the pulsar emission is a crucial parameter in the probability of observation of deflected beams . figure  [ fig : w50_hist ] shows a histogram , for currently known pulsars , of the fwhm of the pulse as a fraction of the pulse duty cycle .",
    "the mean of this distribution is 4.6% , so for probability calculations in this paper we will use a duty cycle of 5% , and therefore a    of particular importance is the fact that a strongly bent beam will generally be reduced in intensity in comparison with a directly observed beam ; thus our detection probabilities must account for the reduced brightness of the source . in terms of the bending function @xmath15 of paper  i ,",
    "the `` amplification '' factor ( generally less than unity ) for intensity is given by @xmath26 as a step in understanding how much reduction can be allowed if a pulsar beam is to be observed , we use the radio luminosity at 1.4 ghz will likely need to be conducted in s band .",
    "nonetheless , we expect the distribution of luminosities to be roughly the same in the two bands . ] for all pulsars for which this quantity has been calculated in the australia telescope national facility @xcite .",
    "we assume that the population of pulsars at the galactic center has the same distribution of luminosities as these known pulsars . in that case",

    "the minimum flux detectable at a telescope can be estimated with the following equation from  @xcite ( hereafter lk ) : @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the pulsar pulse width and period . from our assumption that @xmath31 is 5% we get @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 is a correction factor for imperfections in data collection .",
    "most current pulsar detection systems use a three - level correlarator with @xmath33 of 1.16 ( see lk ) , and this is the value we shall use . for @xmath34 , the number of polarizations recorded and summed in the detection process , we will use @xmath35 because typically two polarizations are summed during pulsar detection scans .",
    "@xmath36 is the minimum detectable signal - to - noise ratio required in a search ; we will take this to be 5 .",
    "for the time pointed at the source , @xmath37 , we will assume a 1 hour observing time .",
    "the bandwidth of the recorded data @xmath38 depends highly on the pulsar detection instruments used at a particular telescope .",
    "bandwidths typically range from 100mhz to 800mhz .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the number of pulsars that are observable at some point in their orbit is not directly relevant if the orbital time is much larger than the duration of an observing program .",

    "each curve is labeled with the number of years assumed for the search . ]",
    "a natural first question about observing strongly deflected beams is `` how will we know that they are strongly deflected ? ''",
    "the answer starts with the fact that the angle through which the beam is `` strongly '' deflected is not large . for our paradigmatic case , @xmath50 ,",
    "the bending is approximately 0.036 rad . for larger @xmath17 the deflection , for a given @xmath40 , is even smaller .    since the `` strong '' deflection is small",
    ", we will receive a deflected beam only when the emitting pulsar , the smbh and the earth are almost on a straight line .",
    "since pulsar beam widths are large compared to the deflection , this means that if the earth receives the deflected beam , it will also receive the direct beam .",
    "the geometry of the direct and deflected beams is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : directdeflected ] , where we see that the angle , at reception , of the direct and deflected beams is not of order @xmath17 divided by the earth - smbh distance ( 8kpc ) , but rather is of order of that number multiplied by the deflection angle .",
    "the result , an angle of order @xmath51 radians , is less than the resolution of radio telescopes .",
    "we conclude that any monitoring of the innermost region of sgr  a@xmath52 for a deflected beam , will also monitor for a direct beam .",
    "the criterion for the detection of a strongly deflected beam will be that it is one of a pair of pulses detected with very similar pulse periods , differing only due to a phase modulation caused by variations in the propagation times along the two paths : the two sets of pulses will differ in pulse period by a fractional amount of order the pulsar velocity divided by @xmath53 .",
    "( see papers  i and  ii for more detail on phase effects and intensity effects of deflection . )",
    "if a deflected beam is detected we therefore assume that it will be relatively simple to identify it as deflected .        if the pfahl and loeb distribution of eq .",
    "( [ nvsr0 ] ) is approximately valid , the results of the previous section , especially fig .",
    "[ fig : obsvst ] , suggest that there is a very good chance of observing a strongly deflected pulsar beam with an observing program of 3 - 5 years , using existing telescopes .",
    "monitoring of sgr  a@xmath52 , of course , will face the problem of dispersion by the plasma density in the galactic center .",
    "assuming dispersion measures in excess of @xmath54 , searches would have to be conducted in s - band ( 24ghz ) or higher frequencies in order to resolve pulses , rather than the more conventional l - band .",
    "we note that the pulsar fluxes and current telescope sensitivities were computed for the l band , since that is where most pulsar luminosities have been measured .",
    "relative sensitivities in the s band may be somewhat lower . however , we note that the baseline value of @xmath47mjy for the parkes telescope is very conservative in view of the sensitivities that will soon be available .",
    "see table  [ tab : tele ] , and the corresponding estimates of detectable pulsars in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsvst ] .",
    "even with the current estimated senstitivity of parkes there is a good chance of detecting strongly - bent pulsar beams in a 23  year observing program ; with more sensitive telescopes such as gbt or fast ( under development ) , the number could rise to several pulsars .",
    "longer observing times increase the number of detectable pulsars by allowing long - period pulsars more time to come into alignment .",
    "an appropriate multiyear observing program can be carried out `` in background '' at a telescope .",
    "observations must be made sufficiently frequently not to miss the relatively short epoch during which the pulsar / smbh / earth alignment leads to a strongly deflected beam meeting the @xmath55 criterion .",
    "that epoch is of order of the orbital time multiplied by the ratio @xmath56 . for our prototypical choice @xmath57 ,",
    "this epoch is on the order of a week .",
    "searches for deflected beams in sgr  a@xmath52 , therefore , would have to be made every other day .",
    "the observing session would be of a duration of that used for any other pulsar search , on the order of 1 hour .",
    "( longer observations might be considered , in view of the effect shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minflux ] ) of @xmath37 on @xmath40 , and hence on the @xmath55 cutoff .",
    "an important question to ask is why we do not yet have evidence of the assumed large population of pulsars in sgr  a@xmath52 .",
    "this can be explained by the lack of any concerted effort to search the galactic center for pulsars , and the need for s band searches with large dispersion corrections .",
    "in addition the galactic center is out of view for the arecibo telescope , and in a portion of the sky with reduced sensitivity for gbt .",
    "currently , parkes is the largest telescope with a clear view of the galactic center ; the fast telescope will substantially increase our sensitivity to the galactic center .",
    "it should be noted that , at least to some extent , monitoring the galactic center for strongly deflected beam would constitute a more general search for pulsars in that region .",
    "the possibility of detecting deflected beams and making measurements of the parameters of the smbh provides added scientific motivation for such a survey .",
    "our estimates suggest that a multi - year program that monitors sgr  a@xmath52 with radio observations for one hour every other day has a reasonable probability of detecting pulsar beams that have been strongly deflected by our galaxy s smbh . with instruments coming in the near future , in particular , fast and ska , the probability should become high enough so that a three year observational program either detects a strongly deflected beam , or that the failure to make such a detection puts useful limits on the density of pulsars in the galactic center .    our estimates in this paper",
    "constitute a first step in the study of probabilities of detection of a strongly deflected beam .",
    "the intention was to establish whether the probabilities are so small that observations are out of the question , or so large that current observations rule out models , like that of @xcite , with a significant density of pulsars in sgr  a@xmath52 .",
    "the estimates in this paper establish neither extreme : a concerted observing program with the best current telescopes would optimistically detect only a few such pulsars .",
    "this provides motivation for such a program , and also for further study of the problem of pulsar beam deflection by smbhs .",
    "such an improved study would have to include effects of spin of the smbh , and of eccentricity of orbits .",
    "while our approach of using averages and simple assumptions was appropriate to the purpose of this paper , effects due to smbh spin , and high eccentricity , could increase the parameter space of pulsar configurations whose beams can reach the earth . such work is now underway .    the most exciting result of these preliminary estimates is their indication that we are potentially on the verge of detecting a new phenomenon : pulsar beams that have passed through the strong field region of the smbh at the center of our galaxy , beams that can bring us information about the properties of the smbh and its surrounding spacetime might be inaccessible in any other way .",

    "we are primarily interested in values of @xmath13 that are only slightly smaller than @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the photon path starting at some very large radius will penetrate to small radii , and almost all the bending will take place at small radii .",
    "we can then find the bending for emission from the very large radius , say @xmath59 , by considering the bending only interior to a smaller large radius , say @xmath60 . in effect , we are considering the large radius region from @xmath61 to @xmath62 to be flat space . from the the curve @xmath63 for @xmath60 , therefore , we can infer the curve for @xmath59 , and for all larger radii ( provided , of course , that @xmath13 is near @xmath58 so that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are much larger than the radii at which the bending occurs ) .      to find the @xmath66 for a photon emitted at a very large @xmath67 , we choose the smaller @xmath17 along the future path of the photon to be a radius for which we know the curve @xmath68 .",
