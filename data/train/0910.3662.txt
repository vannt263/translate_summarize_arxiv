    "there are striking similarities between the catalogue of @xmath3-symmetric quantum spin chains@xcite and the hierarchy of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states @xcite .",
    "arguably the most striking parallel is that both systems allow a @xmath4 classification .",
    "haldane conjectured @xcite that half - integer @xmath3 quantum spin chains support gapless excitations , protected by a topological term in the effective action , while the integer spin chains develop a mass gap .",
    "a similar structure appears in the quantized fqh effect . at filling factors @xmath5 ,",
    "quantized conductance plateaus only occur at rational @xmath6 with _ odd _ denominator , while in the vicinity of _",
    "even_-denominator fractions metallic behavior is sustained . the haldane conjecture and the phenomenology of the fqh effect",
    "communicate something pivotal about the low - lying excitations of seemingly disparate quantum phases , of low - dimensional magnetic materials and 2d electron gas in magnetic field .",
    "hence , it is important to establish whether the similarities are merely accidental or if the structure of low - energy excitations in these systems have a related microscopic origin .",
    "already two decades ago , a more precise analogy between the two systems was discussed @xcite in terms of off - diagonal long - range order in fqh states @xcite and hidden orders present in @xmath7 spin chains @xcite ( see also refs . for related analogies ) .",
    "more recently , a natural framework for studying this connection emerged as it was realized that universal features of many quantum hall ( qh ) phases are retained on a thin torus @xcite ( or tao - thouless , tt @xcite ) limit , where the interacting problem is trivially solvable .",
    "fqh states at odd - denominator filling factor fraction can be deformed into the tt limit without closing the energy gap , as has been rigorously shown at the laughlin fractions @xcite and plausibly argued for at other fractions.@xcite notably different behavior is found in states at even - denominator filling .",
    "for example , analysis of gapless qh state at filling fraction @xmath8 shows that the system undergoes a first order phase transition from a gapped tt state to a gapless phase upon deformation of the torus.@xcite in fact , this analysis of the @xmath8 fqh state uses a @xmath9 spin chain description .",
    "a similar spin - chain picture@xcite can also capture features of non - abelian states@xcite , which further adds to the analogies between spin - chain physics and the fqh effect .",
    "the possibility of a relationship between the haldane conjecture and the fqh effect was suggested in ref .  .",
    "in this article , we provide explicit evidence for such a link by obtaining the phase diagram , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiagram ] , for the @xmath0 fqh state away from the tt limit .",
    "we also outline how such connection can be extended to arbitrary filling fractions @xmath10 .",
    "fqh system as a function of the circumference of the torus , @xmath11 .",
    "the tt limit , @xmath12 , of the fqh problem corresponds to the large-@xmath2 phase of a spin - chain . by increasing @xmath11 , the bulk fqh state",
    "is adiabatically approached and the corresponding spin chain is , for intermediate @xmath11 , characterized by co - existing features of the large-@xmath2 and haldane phases . for very large @xmath11",
    "the fqh / spin - chain correspondence can not be derived microscopically as indicated by question mark on the spin - chain side of the phase diagram.,width=283 ]    our effective model for the @xmath0 system close to the tt limit has the form of a parity breaking spin-@xmath1 chain .",
    "recently , such models have attracted interest in the context of ultra - cold lattice bosons@xcite and are presently featuring in attempts to generally classify topological phases@xcite .",
    "a consequence of the lack of parity symmetry is that phases that are normally separated by a phase boundary can co - exist .",
    "we demonstrate that the effective spin model has characteristics of both the large-@xmath2 phase ( in which an anisotropic single - site term in the hamiltonian , @xmath13 , freezes the spins into @xmath14 ) and the topologically non - trivial haldane phase@xcite , and that the ground state thereof is adiabatically connected ( no gap closing in the thermodynamic limit ) to the ground states of both these phases .",
    "we also investigate to what extent the character of the fqh state can be captured by string order parameters , and find that a `` dual '' version of the conventional string order parameter may be suitable in this context .",
    "the fact that the gapped large-@xmath2 and haldane phases both exclusively exist for integer spin chains suggest that both play a role in a general connection between quantum spin chains and hierarchical ( abelian ) fqh states .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we study the fqh system away from the tt limit and motivate a parity breaking spin-@xmath1 chain as an effective model of the @xmath0 system and outline how this can be generalized to arbitrary fractions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we focus on the spin-@xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) case and extend the effective spin - model to enable interpolation to more conventional spin models , which for example have large-@xmath2 and haldane phases .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we consider a model of @xmath15 interacting electrons in the lowest landau level on the torus . in the landau gauge , a complete basis of @xmath16",
    "degenerate single - particle states , labeled by @xmath17 , can be chosen as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the circumferences of the torus , @xmath20 the corresponding coordinates , and @xmath21 the momentum along the @xmath11-cycle .",
    "we have set the magnetic length @xmath22 equal to unity . in this basis ,",

    "laughlin s state is an exact zero - energy eigenstate of the above hamiltonian with the choice @xmath31 obtained as the matrix elements of a periodized haldane pseudo - potential @xmath32.@xcite the amplitudes @xmath24 are exponentially damped in @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , at small @xmath11 the model can be approximated by a few most dominant terms such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , etc .",

    "clearly the identification explicitly break translational symmetry ",
    "there are three equivalent ways of grouping three electronic sites into one spin site . by choosing a particular grouping of the sites ( so that the ground state appears at total @xmath14 ) we effectively mod out the original three - fold degeneracy.@xcite in terms of @xmath7 variables , the @xmath36-process",
    "is then accounted for by the hamiltonian @xmath46 with @xmath47 we note that this hamiltonian does not have the space inversion and spin reversal symmetries : the process @xmath48 exists but @xmath49 does not .",
    "this `` parity '' breaking is a consequence of the dependence of @xmath24 on the single - particle momentum transfer @xmath26 . for a fixed ( initial )",
    "separation @xmath25 , the amplitudes are asymmetric with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "inward hops have a greater amplitude than outward hops .    in the tt limit ,",
    "the fractionalized excitations of the system are domain walls between the degenerate vacua .",
    "these can be included in the effective spin - chain description by introducing at the domain walls edge spins that carry a lower , @xmath9 , representation .",
    "the energetics of spatially separated domain walls is not essential to the fqh phenomenology as long as we can assume them to localize .",
    "hence , in this paper we only analyze the exciton ( bound quasielectron - quasihole pair ) gap , which we relate to the haldane gap in the effective spin model .",
