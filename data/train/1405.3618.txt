    "the resulting changes in the particle velocity @xmath83 and the instantaneous center of gyration gives rise to a net drift across the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "similarly , the kinetic energy associated with the parallel motion changes as the paritcle moves along the magnetic field into regions with smaller or larger potential energy .    in summary , the motion of a charged particle in constant and uniform electric and magnetic fields can be considered as a fast gyration around the guiding center position and a drift of the guiding center .",

    "the perturbation method presented here gives a direct and physically transparent description of the particle motion on fast and slow spatio - temporal scales , associated respectively with the particle gyration and field variations .",
    "this should be contrasted to the more complicated method of average first introduced morozov and solovev in ref .   and used in most subsequent works on this problem.@xcite the method presented here can trivially be applied to the cases with no temporal or no spatial variations of the fields .",
    "the lowest order particle motion comprises particle gyration , motion along the magnetic field and the electric drift across the magnetic field lines . by first considering the special case of constant and uniform fields",
    ", we introduced the magnetic field based coordinate system , the non - inertial guiding center frame of reference , and the magnetic dipole moment due to particle gyration .",
    "this leads to an intuitive generalization and scale separation for the case of weakly varying fields .    to next order in the expansion ,",
    "numerous fictitious forces appear due to the weak spatio - temporal variations of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "a differential equation describes the particle motion along the magnetic field , including acceleration by the electric force as well as the magnetic mirror and polarization forces .",
    "the first order particle motion across magnetic field lines are given by derivatives of the electromagnetic fields , and include the magnetic gradient and curvature drifts and the well - known polarization drift .",
    "we have given a detailed account of the fictitious forces due to acceleration of the guiding center frame of reference , the associated particle drifts and the energy transfer between the lowest order particle motion .",
    "finally , invariance of the lowest order magnetic moment is shown to be the result of angular momentum conservation in the guiding center frame of reference .",
    "interestingly , the assumption of a zeroth order perpendicular electric field corresponds to the magnetohydrodynamic ordering , implying conservation of magnetic flux through the particle gyro - orbit while the lowest order gyro - averaged equation of motion reduces to the ideal ohm s law upon averaging over the velocity distribution of the charged particles in a plasma .",
