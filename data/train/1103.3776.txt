    "the concept of berry phase has paved a new way for understanding quantum physics , it has attracted much attention since the berry s discovery @xcite and found potential applications in fields ranging from chemistry to condensed matter physics . shortly after berry s discovery , simon gave a mathematical interpretation to this phase that it can be regarded as the holonomy in a hermitian line bundle since the adiabatic theorem naturally defines a connection in such a bundle@xcite . after these remarkable discoveries , hannay found that this geometrical phase not only exist in quantum system but also in classical world @xcite .",
    "analogous with the berry phase , the angle variable of classical integrable systems @xcite acquires an additional angle shift as the system slowly cycles in phase space .",
    "this angle shift is called hannay s angle .",
    "it was later proved by berry that the geometric phase and hannay s angle possess a natural relation under semiclassical approximation @xcite . as a matter of course",

    "it is known that a quantum hilbert space carries the same structure of a classical phase space @xcite . by this virtue , a quantum system can be treated like a classical system without loss of physics @xcite . particularly in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors introduced a general framework for testing nonlinear quantum mechanics . in this generalized theory , the elements of quantum mechanics , such as wave functions , observable , symmetries and time evolution , all can be treated classically .",
    "based on this instructive work , some interesting efforts have been devoted to nonlinear quantum system and quantum - classical hybrid system @xcite",
    ". here come the questions : since quantum mechanics can be put into the framework of classic mechanics , can berry phase be presented into the form of hannay s angle ? what is the berry phase or hannay s angle of the quantum - classical hybrid system ?",
    "how does the subsystem - subsystem couplings affect the hannay s angle and the berry phase ?",
    "we shall shed light on these questions in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first represent a quantum system in the framework of classical theory by weinberg s method@xcite , then we calculate the hannay s angle of the quantum system .",
    "next we compare this hannay s angle with the berry phase of the original quantum system and find that the hannay s angle and berry phase differ only in a sign@xcite .",
    "an example is given to show this result . in sec .",
    "iii , we represent a quantum - classical hybrid system in classical mechanics based on the born - oppenheimer approximation , a unified one - form which can deduce both of the berry phase and the hannay s angle is given . by this one - form ,",
