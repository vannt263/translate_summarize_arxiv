    "code pairs based on trellis coded modulation ( tcm ) @xcite are proposed in @xcite-@xcite such that _ any rate pair _ within the cc capacity region can be approached . such a multiple access scheme which employs capacity approaching trellis codes",

    "it is also known that time division multiple access ( tdma ) and frequency division multiple access ( fdma ) , two of the widely known orthogonal multiple access ( o - ma ) techniques do not achieve all the points on the capacity region . in particular , if fdma is used such that the bandwidth allocated to each user is proportional to its transmit power , then one of the points on the capacity region can be achieved .",
    "note that such an achievable point lies on the sum - capacity line segment of the capacity region @xcite ( note that apart from the point on the sum capacity line , fdma also intersects the capacity region at the axes points ) .",

    "+ from table [ rate_table_designs_1 ] , it is clear that @xmath66 increases as the value of @xmath71 increase .",
    "an intuitive reasoning for such a behaviour is as follows : the term @xmath73 is the cc capacity of a 16 point constellation ( sum alphabet of two qpsk signal sets ) with average energy of @xmath75 whereas @xmath74 is the cc capacity of a 4 point constellation ( qpsk signal set ) with the same average energy of @xmath75 . note that , asymptotically ( for large values of @xmath71 ) , @xmath74 and @xmath73 saturate to 2 bits and 4 bits respectively .",

    "[ region_8db ] which shows that tcma is better than tdma for finite alphabets as well .",
