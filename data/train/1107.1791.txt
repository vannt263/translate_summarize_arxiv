    "low - lying baryons are classified into the octet and decuplet ( spin 3/2 ) baryon members .",
    "this is based on su(3 ) symmetry , which is presently understood in terms of quantum chromodynamincs ( qcd ) . to study the electromagnetic structure of the light baryons ,",
    "they are probed by electron beams , and the form factors are measured as functions of momentum transfer squared @xmath0 , and they reveal the nonpointlike structure of the baryons . in the octet and decuplet baryons ,",
    "only the weak and electromagnetic structure of the nucleon has been well measured in experiments at finite @xmath1 .",
    "our present knowledge of the electromagnetic structure for the octet and decuplet baryons is restricted to magnetic moments of some octet  @xcite and decuplet  @xcite baryons .",
    "thus , except for the nucleon system  @xcite , studies of the weak and electromagnetic structure for the other octet baryon members are very scarce  @xcite .",
    "therefore , more data and studies of the octet baryon structure are desired .    in this work we study the electromagnetic structure of the octet baryons using the covariant spectator quark model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one of our goals is to obtain covariant parametrization associated with the valence quark degrees of freedom , that provides insight into the octet baryon electromagnetic internal structure .",
    "this will open tremendous possibilities for future applications .",
    "a study of the decuplet baryons with the same formalism was already performed successfully in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "generally , phenomenological treatment of baryon structure based solely on the valence quark degrees of freedom , can be improved by the inclusion of the meson cloud effects , guided by chiral effective field theory  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the meson cloud are particularly important for the neutron electric form factor  @xcite , and the electromagnetic transition , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "although chiral perturbation theory is very useful to infer the @xmath1 dependence of the nucleon form factors , it is usually applicable in the very low @xmath1 region ( @xmath3 gev@xmath4 ) , and can not be used to define the scale of separation between the valence quark dominant region from that of the meson - baryon excitations ( meson cloud effects )  @xcite .",
    "the separation is possible only within a specific model .",
    "qcd in the limit of high @xmath1 , and many phenomenological calculations suggests that the meson cloud effects should falloff with increasing @xmath1 , leading to the valence quark dominance in the high @xmath1 region .",
    "however , the magnitude , sign , and the rate of the falloff of the meson cloud excitations depend on models  @xcite . among the mesons ,",
    "the pion is expected to give the most important contributions according to chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , the importance of the effects in nucleon magnetic moments in different models can be found in ref .",
    "however , for the nucleon , an accurate description of the form factors can also be achieved by a model without the pion cloud in the physical and the lattice qcd regimes  @xcite , e.g. , model ii in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the effects of the pion cloud can possibly be small for the nucleon form factors in the low @xmath1 region .",
    "although the pion cloud effects can not be extracted directly from the experimental data , we assume that the octet baryon systems can be described by a mixture of the valence quarks and the pion cloud , and use lattice qcd data to constrain the valence quark contributions , and then to extract the pion cloud effects .    in this study we use the covariant spectator quark model which is inspired by the covariant spectator theory  @xcite . the covariant spectator quark model has been successfully applied for studying the electromagnetic properties of several baryons  @xcite .",
    "a baryon in the model is described by a wave function for the quark - diquark system parametrized in a covariant manner .",
    "the photon - quark coupling is described based on vector meson dominance ( vmd ) for a constituent quark .",
    "because of this feature , the model can be extended easily to the lattice qcd regime  @xcite , as will be explained later .",
    "starting by a simplified model for the nucleon based on an s - state configuration for the quark - diquark system , we extend the model for the octet baryons first , and next to the lattice qcd regime .",
    "that procedure allows us to use the lattice qcd simulation data with large pion masses to constrain better the parameters of the model , instead of using only the physical data .",
    "the final parametrization for the wave functions obtained in the lattice regime , can then be extrapolated to obtain the physical octet baryon wave functions .",
    "this is particularly useful , since there are no experimental data for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryons for @xmath8 .",
    "however , this procedure can only provide the contributions from the valence quarks , since still lattice qcd simulations are presently performed with large pion masses , and thus the effects of the pion cloud are suppressed  @xcite . to take into account the effects of the pion cloud which are very important for the physical regime ,",
    "we first use a simple , covariant parametrization for the pion cloud contributions for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "then , the parametrization for the nucleon is extended to the other octet baryon members using su(3 ) symmetry .",

    "overall , we have used 6 parameters for the valence quark structure , and 7 parameters for the pion cloud effects .",
    "we have derived a parametrization for the octet baryon wave functions depending on the baryon flavors .",
    "the parametrized wave functions are very useful for future studies of the electromagnetic reactions .",
    "our results suggest a dominance of the valence quark effects , but the inclusion of the pion cloud effects improves the global description of the octet baryon electromagnetic form factor data .",
    "the pion cloud effects are of the order of 15% for the nucleon in the low @xmath1 region , but decrease in the higher @xmath1 region .",
    "surprisingly , the pion cloud effects are still important for the nucleon electric form factors in the region of 5 - 10 gev@xmath4 with the contributions of 5 - 8% .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the value of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 gev@xmath4 ) for the pion cloud parametrization , which gives a slow falloff for the pauli form factor @xmath45 .",
    "we have a good description of the nucleon data ( @xmath46 per data point @xmath471.9 ) , but for the description of the neutron it is slightly worse ( @xmath46 per data point of 1.9 and 2.3 for the electric and magnetic form factors , respectively ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the high accuracy of the recent @xmath48 data  @xcite , and also our ambition to describe simultaneously the lattice and physical data .",
    "the large number of the lattice data points reduces the impact of the nucleon physical data .",

    "this can be done using a more complete lattice qcd database including the results from refs .",

    "@xcite , since one of our goals is the overall description of the octet baryon electromagnetic structure , and we prefer to avoid possible inconsistencies arising from different lattice qcd simulations .    our results for the neutron form factors require some discussions",
    ". our global fit has turned up to give a poor description for the neutron electric form factor for @xmath52 gev@xmath4 ( electric charge squared radius of @xmath53 fm@xmath4 ) . although @xmath55 is poorly constrained by the lattice data , it is complemented by the physical data .",
    "our result for the neutron electric squared radius differs appreciably from the experimental value , although our estimate of the bare valence quark core is closer to the experimental value , and also to that of the valence quark contribution from ref .",
    "we interpret this as a consequence of the impact of the high @xmath1 region data ( very precise in general ) , which reduce the impact of the low @xmath1 region data ( less accurate ) in the global fit .",
    "as already discussed , a more precise calibration of the model for the neutron will require a more detailed analysis of the nucleon system , and this will be possible when more precise data as in ref .",
    "@xcite become available .",
    "more accurate lattice qcd data for the neutron can also be very useful .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the pion cloud effects are indeed important and influential for the neutron data .",
    "overall , we have a very good global description of both the lattice qcd and physical data for the charged particles @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for the analysis of neutral particles",
    ", one must be careful , because they have been less constrained by the lattice data ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , or not at all constrained ( @xmath6 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "but we can conclude that the pion cloud effects are very important for the electromagnetic form factors @xmath62 of neutral particles .    concerning the size of the octet baryons",
    ", we conclude that , as expected , the systems with two strange quarks are more compact than those of the one strange quark , and the latter is more compact than the nucleon system with no strange quark .",
    "the estimates of the octet baryon sizes ( electric charge squared and magnetic dipole squared radii ) due to the valence quarks ( bare core ) are consistent with this conclusion , and are also in agreement with the independent estimates  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the pion cloud effects in the electric charge squared radii , in general , makes the final results approach to the experimental results , and also to the values estimated based on the lattice results extrapolated using chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the agreement between our estimates with the octet baryon electromagnetic form factor data , and also those of the radii , gives us some confidence about the applicability of our model to estimate the valence quark effects both in the physical and lattice regimes .",
