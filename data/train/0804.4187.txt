    "to investigate the behavior of a multiple - access communication network consisting of large number of selfish transmitters , we consider the network model depicted in fig . [ fig : network model ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : network model ] , each transmitter in the transmitter set has an intended receiver in the receiver set . in the context of cellular networks ,",
    "the transmitter set consists of mobile users requesting uplink reservations to communicate with a base station . in a more general setting",
    ", it can be thought of as containing some number of wireless transmitters that are closely located in a wireless ad - hoc network , and that are willing to communicate with another close - by node .",
    "the results in this paper can be viewed as characterizing the local behavior of dense wireless networks containing selfish nodes and using a collision channel model at the medium access control ( mac ) layer .",
    "the collision channel model has been extensively used in the past ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it is used to characterize the behavior of networks using no power control and containing nodes with single packet detection capabilities . the protocol model defined in @xcite is a variation of the collision model .",
    "we assume that transmitter nodes always have packets to transmit , and a transmission fails if there is more than one transmission at the same time .",
    "the cost of unsuccessful transmission of node @xmath0 is @xmath1 .",
    "a likely meaning that can be attributed to @xmath2 s is the useless power expenditure caused by failed packets .",
    "if a transmission is successful , the node that transmitted its packet successfully gets a normalized utility of @xmath3 unit .",
    "we model this situation by using a strategic game @xmath4 , which is defined formally as follows : in definition [ def : one - shot game ] , @xmath5 denotes the @xmath6 norm for vectors in @xmath7 , and is thus the sum of the absolute values of the components of a vector . if @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , then we will denote @xmath10 by @xmath11 , and call it a _ homogenous _ one - shot random access game .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 will indicate a poisson distribution with mean @xmath14 and a 0 - 1 bernoulli distribution with mean @xmath15 , respectively , as well as the generic random variables with these distributions .",
    "for any given two discrete distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the set of integers @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the _ variational distance _ between them , which is defined as @xmath20 . if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are random variables with distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we sometimes write @xmath23 in stead of @xmath24 for ease of understanding . if one of the arguments of @xmath25 contains a summation of some random variables , this refers to the convolution of their respective distributions .",
    "if a sequence of probability distributions @xmath26 converges ( in the usual sense of convergence in distribution ) to another probability distribution @xmath16 , we represent this convergence by @xmath27 as @xmath28 .    as in standard terminology , we call a nash equilibrium a _ fully - mixed nash equilibrium _ ( fmne ) if all of the transmitters transmit with some positive probability in @xmath29 at this equilibrium",
    ". we call a nash equilibrium a _ pure strategy nash equilibrium _ if all transmitters choose their actions deterministically .",
    "therefore , any given transmitter @xmath30 either transmits or backs - off with probability one at a pure strategy equilibrium .",
    "@xmath31 is the 0 - 1 random variable showing the action chosen by transmitter @xmath30 when the game @xmath10 is played . as noted before , @xmath32 means back - off , and @xmath3 means transmit .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the transmission probability of transmitter @xmath0 when there are @xmath34 transmitters contending for the channel access .",
    "also let @xmath35 represent the total number of packet arrivals when there are @xmath34 transmitters contending for the channel access .",
    "note that @xmath36 . for a given",
    "set @xmath37 , @xmath38 will represent the cardinality of this set .",
    "the transmission probability vector at which all nodes back - off with probability one is not a nash equilibrium of @xmath4 since any node can obtain positive utility by setting its transmission probability to a positive number given the fact that others do not transmit .",
    "therefore , there is an incentive for nodes to deviate from the strategy profile at which all of them back - off .",
    "as a result , at nash equilibria of @xmath4 , we expect to observe some of the transmitters transmitting with some positive probabilities and the remaining back - off with probability one . to further investigate this point , let @xmath39 be such that for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the following theorem from @xcite characterizes the nash equilibria of this game .",
    "we briefly mention the form of the asymptotic distribution of the total number of packet arrivals when all transmitters have identical utility functions . in this case , the necessary and sufficient condition given in theorem [ thm : nash equilibria for inhomogenous m person game ] can be satisfied for any subset @xmath37 of @xmath42 with @xmath43 for proper choice of the nodes transmission probabilities .",
    "therefore , for any given @xmath44 with @xmath45 , a mixed strategy nash equilibrium at which only the transmitters in @xmath37 transmit with some positive probability , and the rest of them back - off with probability one exists . at such a nash equilibrium ,",
    "the transmission probabilities of transmitters in @xmath37 are all equal to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , transmitters transmit with probability @xmath47 at the fmne .",
    "hence , at the fmne of the homogenous random access game , @xmath35 becomes a binomial random variable with the success probability @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath48 approaches to @xmath49 as @xmath34 goes to infinity , @xmath35 converges , in distribution , to a poisson distribution with mean @xmath49 , which can be shown by using poisson approximation the binomial distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the paper , our aim is to prove the limit theorem for @xmath35 in the more general case when nodes do not have identical utility functions .",
    "we first give a counter example showing that the limiting distribution of @xmath35 can not always be a pure poisson distribution .",
    "in this latter case , we then , however , show that it can be arbitrarily closely approximated in distribution by a summation of finitely many independent bernoulli random variables and a poisson random variable .",
    "two closely related work are @xcite and @xcite . in these work",
    ", they analyze the performance of slotted aloha protocol with selfish transmitters by only considering the homogenous case where selfish nodes have identical utility functions .",
    "moreover , they do not provide any results regarding the asymptotic packet arrival distribution . in @xcite , we mostly focused on the asymptotic channel throughput and the asymptotic packet arrival distribution in the homogenous case for the same problem set - up",
    ". we also provided a weaker necessary condition for the convergence of packet arrivals in distribution in the heterogeneous case .",
    "different from the existing work in the literature , this paper will concentrate on the asymptotic packet arrival distribution in the more general case when selfish transmitters having different utility functions contend for the access of a common wireless communication channel .",
    "we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of total number of packet arrivals in distribution as the number of selfish transmitters increases to infinity .",
    "we also specify the form of the asymptotic packet arrival distribution .",
    "we start our discussion with an example illustrating that the poisson type convergence does not occur in general in the heterogeneous case . this result , while somewhat negative , will shed light on the form of the limiting distributions for @xmath35 . in this example",
    ", the limiting distribution of the packet arrivals will be a mixture of a poisson distribution and several bernoulli distributions .",
    "* example : * we consider the fmne of the one - shot random access game , and let @xmath50 . by theorem [ thm : nash equilibria for inhomogenous m person game ] , @xmath51 has an fmne if and only if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath52 @xmath53 since the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : example - ii n&s condition ] ) approaches to @xmath54 , we must choose @xmath55 for all @xmath56 to have the fmne for all @xmath34 large enough .",
    "any choice of @xmath57 such that @xmath55 for all @xmath56 and @xmath58 is good for our purposes .",
    "one way of choosing such @xmath59 s is to make all of the @xmath60 s smaller than @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath62 .    for appropriately chosen @xmath59 , @xmath63",
    ", we have the following transmission probabilities : @xmath64 define @xmath65 .",
    "then , @xmath66 .",
    "observe that @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 as a result , we conclude , by using the continuity theorem and the independence of the random variables @xmath70 and @xmath31 , that @xmath71    one interesting feature of this example is that we can not find infinitely many @xmath59 s that are uniformly bounded away from @xmath3 , since @xmath72 as @xmath73 . this observation will help us in obtaining the asymptotic distribution of @xmath35 in the heterogeneous case .    for the rest of the paper , we focus on the asymptotic distribution of @xmath35 at the fmne of @xmath74 since the fmne is the fairest nash equilibrium at which all transmitters have a chance to transmit with some positive probability depending on their costs of failed transmissions .",
    "more general results can be found in @xcite . set @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we will assume that the costs of unsuccessful transmission of the nodes depend only on their internal parameters such as remaining battery lifetime or energy spent per transmission .",
    "therefore , adding new transmitters to the game does not change the costs of the transmitters already playing the game .",
    "thus , @xmath77 is well - defined .",
    "the following two auxiliary results will help in proving the main theorem , theorem [ thm : asymptotic arrivals in inhomogneous case ] , of the paper .",
    "their proofs can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first one states the convergence of the geometric mean of the numbers @xmath78 to a constant @xmath79 as @xmath28 if the fmne exists for all @xmath80 .",
    "the second one states the convergence of the @xmath81 s to the same constant @xmath82 if the fmne exists for all @xmath83 .",
    "[ lemma : limit of geometric mean of a_i ] _ let @xmath84 denote the geometric mean of @xmath78 .",
    "if the fmne exists for all @xmath83 exists , then @xmath85 . _    [ lemma : homogeneous case is the best possible case ] _ if the fmne exists for all @xmath83 , then @xmath86 . _    in words ,",
    "lemma [ lemma : homogeneous case is the best possible case ] says that if the fmne exists for all @xmath83 , then we can find a @xmath87 such that for any given @xmath88 , the costs of all the transmitters , except for the finitely many of them , incurred as a result of unsuccessful transmissions are concentrated in @xmath89 .",
    "intuitively , we anticipate the selfish nodes whose costs lie in @xmath89 to behave as in the homogeneous case .",
    "thus , the total number of packet arrivals from these nodes can be approximated by a poisson random variable up to an arbitrarily small error term @xmath90 depending on @xmath91 .",
    "the arrivals from the other finitely many nodes whose costs lie outside of @xmath89 can be given by a summation of finitely many bernoulli random variables .",
    "therefore , we expect that once @xmath35 converges in distribution , for any given @xmath92 , we should be able to find a poisson random variable @xmath12 and finitely many bernoulli random variables @xmath93 such that @xmath35 can be approximated , in variational distance , by the sum of @xmath12 and @xmath93 up to an error term less than @xmath94 . a pictorial representation of this fact is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : theorem 2 ] .    the main result of the paper formally stating the above observation is given in theorem [ thm : asymptotic arrivals in inhomogneous case ] . in the proof of theorem [ thm : asymptotic arrivals in inhomogneous case ] , we let @xmath95 when the fmne exists for all @xmath83 .",
