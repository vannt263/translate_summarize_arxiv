    "the axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) @xcite uses a sikivie microwave cavity detector @xcite to search for axions in our galactic halo .",
    "the power in an axion signal observed by a microwave cavity detector is proportional to the local axion density .",
    "the signal width is caused by the velocity dispersion of dark - matter axions .",
    "therefore , in searching for axions it is necessary to make some assumptions about their velocity distribution in our galactic halo .",
    "a variety of galactic halo models have been put forward : the isothermal model , results from n - body simulations @xcite and the caustic ring model @xcite .",
    "the predictions of these models are used to guide admx s search .    in the isothermal model",
    "it is expected that a significant fraction of the dark matter halo will have an isothermal velocity distribution resulting from a period of `` violent relaxation '' of the early galaxy @xcite .",
    "this component of the halo will have velocities described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the `` medium resolution '' ( mr ) channel @xcite searches for these axions , assuming that the velocity dispersion is @xmath1 or less .",
    "( the escape velocity from our galaxy for axions is approximately @xmath2 . )",
    "n - body simulations and the caustic ring model both predict substructure within halos .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that hundreds of smaller clumps , or subhalos , exist within the larger halo @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption of these subhalos leads to flows in the form of `` tidal tails '' or `` streams '' .",
    "the earth may currently be in a stream of dark matter from the sagittarius a dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "non - thermalized flows from late infall of dark matter onto the halo are also expected @xcite .",
    "insufficient time has elapsed for dark matter that has fallen into the gravitational potential of the galaxy after violent relaxation to thermalize with the rest of the halo .",
    "matter which has fallen onto the galaxy only recently will be present in the halo in the form of discrete flows .",
    "there will be one flow of particles falling into the gravitational potential for the first time , one flow of particles falling out for the first time , one due to particles falling in for the second time , etc .",
    "furthermore , where the gradient of the particle velocity diverges , particles `` pile up '' and form caustics . in the limit of zero flow velocity dispersion , caustics have infinite particle density .",

    "thus , a flow of dark matter axions will have a small velocity dispersion , leading to large , but finite density at the location of a caustic .",
    "the caustic ring model predicts that the earth is located near a caustic feature @xcite .",
    "fitting the model to bumps in the milky way rotation curve and a triangular feature seen in the iras maps predicts that the flows falling in and out of the halo for the fifth time contain a significant fraction of the local halo density .",

    "we use the hr channel to search for narrow peaks caused by flows of cold axions through the detector .",
    "the background is thermal and electronic noise plus narrow lines from the rf environment of the experiment .",
    "these environmental peaks are signals from nearby emitters ( e.g.   computer clocks ) which leak into the cavity by a variety of means .    when placing limits on cold flows of axions , we assume that the flows are steady , i.e.  the rates of change of velocity , velocity dispersion and density of the flows are slow compared to the time scale of the experiment .",
    "the assumption of a steady flow implies that the signal we are searching for is always present .",
    "even so , the kinetic energy term in eq.([eq : nre ] ) and the corresponding signal frequency change over time due to the earth s rotational and orbital motions .",
    "in addition to a signal frequency shift in data taken at different times , apparent broadening of the signal occurs because its frequency shifts while the data are being taken .    in this section ,",

    "thus , the frequency at which axions are resonantly converted to photons will shift .",
    "we show here that this frequency modulation can not move a signal by an amount which is larger than the detector bandwidth . as the energy of an axion in the admx detector is non - relativistic ( eq .  ( [ eq : nre ] ) ) , the shift in frequency of the signal , @xmath47 , due to a change in velocity of the axion flow relative to the detector , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 we have investigated the magnitude of both annual and diurnal signal modulation at @xmath50 500  mhz",
    ". the velocity of a dark matter flow relative to the earth will be in the range 1001000 km / s .",
    "we chose 600 km / s as a representative value for the purpose of estimation . for the daily modulation",
    ", we have assumed that the detector is located at the earth s equator and that , in the frame in which the axis of rotation of the earth is stationary , the flow velocity is first aligned and then anti - aligned ( or vice versa ) with the detector s motion due to the earth s rotation over the course of a day .",
    "these assumptions result in the largest possible change in relative velocity between the detector and the flow due to the earth s rotation .",
    "the earth s rotational velocity is 0.4 km / s at the equator .",
    "the resulting daily signal modulation is of order 1  hz . for the annual modulation ,",
    "to again maximize the change in relative velocity , we have also considered the case of extreme flow velocity alignment with the earth s orbital motion .",
    "the earth s orbital velocity is 30 km / s .",
    "the annual modulation produces the larger frequency shift , of order 100  hz within a year .",
    "the hr channel has a 6  khz bandwidth , ensuring that an axion peak will appear in spectra taken with center frequency equal to a previously observed axion signal frequency .",
    "the signal broadening , @xmath51 , due to a change @xmath52 in flow velocity while data are being taken is @xmath53 the most significant signal broadening is due to the earth s rotation . using the same assumptions as before , we find that the broadening is at most @xmath54 hz during the 52 s taken to acquire a single time trace .",
    "this is less than the spectral resolution of 0.019 hz . the broadening due to the earth s orbital motion is only of order @xmath55  hz in this same time interval .",
    "as the signal broadening due to the earth s rotation and orbital motion is negligible , we can use eq .",

    ", we do not know the velocity dispersion of the cold axion flows which we search for , although we note that @xcite claims an upper limit of 53 m / s on the velocity dispersion of the big flow .",
    "subsequently , we do not know the signal width . to compensate ,",
    "we perform our search at multiple resolutions by combining 0.019  hz wide bins .",

    ", it is important that we understand the noise in the hr channel .",
    "the noise in the hr channel is observed to have an exponential distribution .",
    "we now explain why this is expected .",
    "the noise in a single bin is the sum of independent sine and cosine components , as no averaging occurs .",
    "we expect that the noise amplitude , @xmath71 , for a single component ( i.e. sine or cosine ) has a gaussian probability distribution , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the standard deviation",
    ". indeed , the energy distribution should be proportional to a boltzmann factor , @xmath74 , and non - relativistic and classical energies , such as @xmath75 or @xmath76 are proportional to squares of the amplitude .",

    "the sum of @xmath77 independent normal - distributed components is described by a chi - square distribution with @xmath77 degrees of freedom .",

    "the deviation of the data from eq .",

    "each remaining frequency bin is then weighted by a factor equal to the receiver chain response at the given frequency divided by the maximum receiver chain response .",
    "interpolation for frequency points not specifically included in the calibration curve is performed by assuming that each point on the calibration curve was representative of 512 bins centered on that frequency , so all power corresponding to frequencies within that range is normalized by the same factor . as the calibration curve varies slowly with frequency within the window to which each spectra is cropped , this is an adequate treatment of the normalization .",

    "the corresponding axion mass range is 1.972.17 @xmath0ev .",
    "each @xmath56-bin search places an upper limit on the density of a flow with maximum velocity dispersion , @xmath118 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdisp ] ) .",
    "several factors reduce the power developed in an axion peak from that given in eq .",
    "( [ e : power ] ) .",
    "the experiment is operated near critical coupling of the cavity to the preamplifier , so that half this power is observed when the cavity resonance frequency , @xmath119 , is precisely tuned to the axion energy .",
    "if @xmath119 is not at the center of a @xmath120-bin , the power is spread into adjacent bins , as discussed below .",
    "when the axion energy is off - resonance , but still within the cavity bandwidth at a frequency @xmath121 , the lorentzian cavity response reduces the power developed by an additional factor of @xmath122 to be conservative , we calculate the limits at points where successive spectra overlap , i.e.  at the frequency offset from @xmath119 that minimizes @xmath123 .",
    "if a narrow axion peak falls at the center of a 1-bin , all power is deposited in that 1-bin . however ,",
    "if such a peak does not fall at the center of a 1-bin , the power will be spread over several 1-bins .",
    "we now calculate the minimum power in a single @xmath56-bin caused by a randomly situated , infinitely narrow axion line .",
    "the data recorded is the voltage output from the cavity as a function of time .",
    "the voltage as a function of frequency is obtained by fourier transformation and then squared to obtain a raw `` power '' spectrum .",
    "the actual power is obtained by comparison to the rms noise power .",
    "the data are sampled for a finite amount of time and thus , the fourier transformation of the output , @xmath124 , will be of the voltage multiplied by a windowing function , i.e. @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the measured output voltage and @xmath127 is the windowing function for a sampling period @xmath128 , @xmath129 eq .

    "thus , for an axion signal of frequency @xmath121 falling in 1-bin @xmath136 , a fraction of the power @xmath138 is lost to the @xmath139th 1-bin from 1-bin @xmath136 , where @xmath140 . if @xmath141 , i.e  the axion signal frequency is exactly equal to a 1-bin center frequency , all the power is deposited in a single 1-bin . however ,",
    "if this is not the case , power is lost to other 1-bins . in setting limits",
    ", we assume that the power loss is maximal .    the maximum power loss occurs when a signal in the 1-bin search falls exactly between the center frequency of two adjacent 1-bins . in this case , when @xmath142 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sinc2 ] ) shows that 40.5% of the power will be deposited in each of two 1-bins . in @xmath56-bin seaches with @xmath143 , not as much power is lost to other @xmath56-bins , due to the overlap between successive @xmath56-bins .",
    "the minimum power deposited in an @xmath56-bin is 81% for @xmath144 , 87% for @xmath145 and 93% for @xmath146 . for @xmath116 64 , 512 and 4096 ,",
    "the amount of power not deposited in a single @xmath56-bin is negligible .    for the @xmath56-bin searches with @xmath116 64 , 512 and 4096 ,",
    "a background noise subtraction was performed which will lead to exclusion limits at the 97.7% confidence level .",
    "these limits are derived using the power at which the sum of the signal power and background noise power have a 97.7% probability to exceed the candidate thresholds .",
    "we call this power the `` effective '' threshold for each search .",
    "the effective thresholds are obtained by integrating the noise probability distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nprob ] ) , numerically solving for the background noise power corresponding to the 97.7% confidence level for each @xmath56 and subtracting these values from the original candidate thresholds . for @xmath116 64 , 512 and 4096 ,",
    "the effective thresholds are 71 , 182 and 531 @xmath61 , respectively . for smaller values of @xmath56",
    ", background noise subtraction does not significantly improve the limits and the effective threshold was taken to be the candidate threshold .",

    "we have obtained exclusion limits on the density in local flows of cold axions over a wide range of velocity dispersions .",
    "the most stringent limit , shown in fig .  [ f : limits2 ] , is from the 2-bin search . for a flow velocity of 600 km / s relative to the detector",
    ", the 2-bin search corresponds to a maximum flow velocity dispersion of 10 m / s .",
    "the 1-bin search limit is less general , in that the corresponding flow velocity dispersion is half that of the 2-bin limit .",
    "it is also less stringent ; much more power may be lost due to a signal occurring away from the center of a bin than in the @xmath144 case . for @xmath149 , the limits are more general , but the larger power threshold of the searches make them less stringent .",
    "the largest flow predicted by the caustic ring model has density @xmath9 g/@xmath10 ( @xmath150 gev/@xmath10 ) , velocity of approximately @xmath151  km / s relative to the detector , and velocity dispersion less than 53 m / s @xcite . using eq .",

    "this flow would be detected for approximately half the search range .",
    "figure  [ f : limits2 ] demonstrates that the high resolution analysis improves the detection capabilities of admx when a significant fraction of the local dark matter density is due to flows from the incomplete thermalization of matter that has only recently fallen onto the halo .",
