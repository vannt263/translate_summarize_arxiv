    "single - inclusive hadron production is the most appropriate and powerful benchmark for challenging altogether our understanding of the partonic structure of nucleons , the dynamics of hard quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) interactions , the validity of qcd factorization , and the way in which quarks and gluons produce the detected final - state hadrons .",
    "the last few years have witnessed a remarkable improvement in both precision and variety for this kind of measurements , which are expected to continue yielding crucial pieces of information in the future .    in a recent article @xcite , we have demonstrated the feasibility of performing a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) combined qcd analysis of single - inclusive pion and kaon production data , coming from electron - positron annihilation , semi - inclusive deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( sidis ) , and proton - proton collisions , collected over a wide kinematic range .",
    "the analysis not only allowed a very good _ global _ description of all these processes , but provided also accurate parametrizations for the parton - to - pion and parton - to - kaon fragmentation functions , which encode the details of the non - perturbative hadronization process relevant for the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) framework based on the factorization theorem .    in the following , we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite first to the case of single - inclusive proton and anti - proton production , again including not only the electron - positron annihilation data @xcite used in all previous fits @xcite , but , for the first time , also the very precise data recently obtained in proton - proton collisions at rhic @xcite , where final state protons and anti - protons are discriminated .",
    "next , after having obtained reliable fragmentation functions for the three lightest and most copiously produced charged hadron species , pions and kaons from ref .",
    "@xcite and ( anti-)protons , we analyze inclusive , i.e. , _ unidentified _ , charged hadron yields obtained in electron - positron annihilation @xcite , proton-(anti-)proton collisions @xcite , and sidis @xcite . here",
    "we are aiming at an extraction of the contribution from the `` residual '' charged hadrons other than pions , kaons , and ( anti-)protons , to the inclusive charged hadron fragmentation functions .    only from a global qcd analysis",
    "we can obtain individual quark and anti - quark fragmentation functions for unidentified positively or negatively charged hadrons without having to make assumptions on the relation between favored ( valence - type ) and unfavored ( sea - type ) contributions .",
    "such assumptions have been shown to be often not adequate for reproducing presently available single - inclusive hadron production yields beyond those obtained in electron - positron annihilation @xcite .",
    "in addition , data from proton-(anti-)proton collisions are crucial for reducing the uncertainties in the gluon - to - hadron fragmentation function @xcite since scaling violations of @xmath0 data are not much of a constraint due to the lack of precision data at more than one value of the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . )",
    "energy @xmath1 .",
    "both resulting new sets of nlo fragmentation functions reproduce with remarkable accuracy the data available and hence complement consistently our previous studies for pions and kaons .",
    "previously available sets of inclusive charged hadron fragmentation functions are all based on fits to @xmath0 data only and either sum up the results obtained for pions , kaons , and ( anti-)protons , ignoring possible contributions from heavier charged hadrons @xcite or the residual hadron contribution already includes protons and anti - protons @xcite .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite provides only fragmentation functions for unidentified charged hadrons , again based on @xmath0 data only , however , an attempt was made to further constrain the gluon fragmentation function by comparing to one of the many data sets from proton-(anti-)proton collisions .    in the next section",
    ", we briefly highlight the main features of the present analysis , specifically discussing our choice of parametrizations for the proton and the residual charged hadron fragmentation functions and emphasizing the charge conjugation and flavor symmetry assumptions we still have to make . in section iii we present our results for both nlo fits , and assess the uncertainties involved with the help of the lagrange multiplier technique . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our main results . for completeness , the appendix contains the results of the global analyses performed at leading order ( lo ) accuracy , which compares significantly less favorable to data than our nlo fits .",
    "in the present analysis we work in the well established framework of pqcd for single - inclusive hadron production processes at nlo accuracy , thoroughly discussed and implemented in ref .",
    "we make an extensive use of the mellin transform technique @xcite developed for a fast computation of the exact nlo cross sections in each step of a global @xmath2 minimization procedure .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for further technical details on the general qcd framework and the assessment of uncertainties in global fits with the help of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the analysis proceeds in two stages , the first dedicated to the extraction of the parton - to-(anti-)proton fragmentation functions , followed by the determination of inclusive charged hadron fragmentation functions in the second .      in the first step of our global analysis we aim to determine individual fragmentation functions @xmath3 for quarks and anti - quarks of all flavors @xmath4 as well as for gluons into either protons ( @xmath5 ) or anti - protons ( @xmath6 ) . at variance with previous analyses @xcite ,",
    "the use of data that discriminate between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the final - state , allows us to extract fragmentation functions for either particle . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to have the flexibility required by charge separated distributions and to accommodate the additional data , we adopt a somewhat more versatile functional form for the input distributions at scale @xmath9 than in @xcite @xmath10 } { b[2+\\alpha_i,\\beta_i+1]+\\gamma_i b[2+\\alpha_i,\\beta_i+\\delta_i+1]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] represents the euler beta function and @xmath12 is normalized such to represent the contribution of @xmath3 to the second moment @xmath13 entering the energy - momentum sum rule .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the fraction of the fragmenting parton s energy taken by the produced hadron @xmath15 . as in @xcite , the initial scale @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - input ] ) for the @xmath16-evolution is taken to be @xmath17 for the light @xmath18 partons and the quark masses for the heavier ones .",
    "the parameters describing the fragmentation functions @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - input ] ) are determined by a standard @xmath2 minimization for @xmath20 data points , where @xmath21 @xmath22 is the measured value of a given observable , @xmath23 the error associated with this measurement , and @xmath24 is the corresponding theoretical estimate for a given set of parameters in ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) .",
    "since the full error correlation matrices are not available for most of the data entering the global analysis , we take the statistical and systematical errors in quadrature in @xmath23 .    in order to reduce the number of parameters in ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) to those that can be effectively constrained by the data , we impose , as usual , certain relations among the individual fragmentation functions",
    "we have checked in each case that relaxing these assumptions indeed does not significantly improve the total @xmath2 of the fit ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) to warrant any additional parameters . in detail , for the fragmentation of light quark flavors to a proton",
    "we assume the same shape for up and down quarks and for up and down anti - quarks with the same @xmath14-independent normalization ratios @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath26 the relation between quark and anti - quark fragmentation functions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 flavors is determined by the global fit through @xmath29 with @xmath30 constrained to be positive . for strange quarks",
    "it is assumed that @xmath31 with the su(3)-breaking parameter @xmath32 independent of @xmath14 . for charm , bottom , and gluon - to - proton fragmentation",
    "we find no improvement in the total @xmath2 for @xmath33 in ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) , hence we set @xmath34 .    to obtain the corresponding fragmentation functions @xmath35 for anti - protons we assume charge conjugation symmetry , i.e. , @xmath36 leaving in total 17 free parameters to be determined by the global fit .",
    "the fragmentation functions @xmath3 for unidentified positively charged hadrons ( @xmath37 ) are defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 were already determined in ref .",
    "@xmath41 denotes the residual contribution of positively charged hadrons other than pions , kaons , and protons to the inclusive sum @xmath42 . a definition analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : residual ] ) is used for the fragmentation @xmath43 into negatively charged hadrons .",
    "since pions are much more copiously produced than heavier kaons and protons are even less abundant , it is natural to expect that eq .",
    "( [ eq : residual ] ) is strongly dominated by @xmath44 leaving @xmath41 to be small .",
    "nevertheless it is an important consistency check to extract a small but non - vanishing @xmath41 ( and @xmath45 ) from data to actually confirm this hierarchy .",
    "if the global fit would require , for instance , a large or even a negative residual contribution , the usefulness of the previously extracted fragmentation functions for light hadrons would be in jeopardy .    for @xmath41",
    "it turns out that the data are most economically described by assuming full su(3 ) flavor symmetry for both quarks and anti - quarks @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , in the ansatz ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) .",
    "again , @xmath48 and for @xmath49 we set @xmath50 in ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) , however , @xmath51 has a preference for @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath41 we assume charge conjugation symmetry , i.e. , @xmath53 leaving in total 18 free parameters to be fitted here .",
    "we note that the @xmath16-dependence for all fragmentation functions is computed with the appropriate nlo evolution equations as explained in detail in ref .",
    "uncertainties in the extraction of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff - input ] ) will be assessed with the help of the lagrange multiplier technique as described again in @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail the results of our global analyses of fragmentation functions for protons and residual charged hadrons as outlined above .",
    "we present the parameters of the optimum fits describing the nlo @xmath54 at the input scale @xmath9 and compare to all data sets used in the analyses , including individual @xmath2 values .",
    "detailed comparisons are made with previous fits based exclusively on the available electron - positron annihilation data in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in the following labeled as akk , hkns , and kre , respectively .",
    "three different processes allow the extraction of the ( anti-)proton fragmentation functions in our global analysis .",
    "first of all , we have the `` standard '' electron - positron annihilation data @xcite customarily included also in most of the previous analyses @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of @xmath0 annihilation data in general is that they only provide information on a certain hadron species summed over the charges , i.e. , in this case on the sum of protons and anti - protons . besides the fully inclusive measurements",
    ", sld @xcite and delphi @xcite also give results for `` flavor enriched '' cross sections , distinguishing between the sum of light @xmath55 quarks , charm , and bottom events .",
    "the quark flavor is determined from monte - carlo simulations and refers to the primary @xmath56 pair created by the intermediate @xmath57-boson or photon .",
    "such results have to be taken with a grain of salt as they can not be unambiguously interpreted and calculated in pqcd .",
    "nevertheless , in our analysis of pion and kaon data @xcite we always found good agreement between data and theory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : protoninclusive ] we provide a detailed comparison in terms of `` ( data - theory)/theory '' between all the @xmath0 data sets included in the analysis and our nlo results .",
    "the best agreement is found for aleph and delphi inclusive measurements , although sld and tpc , as well as flavor tagged data sets , also agree well with the fit within the fairly large experimental uncertainties .",
    "the fluctuations in the data are significantly larger than in the case of pions , but roughly comparable to those found for kaons , see ref .",
    "other recent fits @xcite all reproduce the data shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : protoninclusive ] equally well within the experimental uncertainties . since the current @xmath0 data basically only constrain the total singlet fragmentation function @xmath58 at scale @xmath59 , all sets differ considerably in their individual flavor content as we shall see below .",
    "we wish to recall that the range of applicability for fragmentation functions is severely limited to medium - to - large values of @xmath14 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in order to avoid the potentially problematic low-@xmath14 region , we exclude from the fit all data with energy fractions lower than @xmath60 .",
    "the extrapolation of our fit , however , reproduces the trend of the data reasonably well also below @xmath61 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : protoninclusive ] .",
    "the second key ingredient in our global analysis are the single - inclusive hadron production data from proton - proton collisions at bnl - rhic taken by star @xcite at mid - rapidity @xmath62 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : star - proton ] .",
    "these data discriminate final - state protons from anti - protons and hence , in principle , allow to separate quark - to - proton and anti - quark - to - proton fragmentation functions in the fit .",
    "however , at the presently accessible range of transverse momenta @xmath63 and at mid - rapidities the production of single - inclusive hadrons is mainly driven by gluon - induced processes and fragmentation , turning these data into the best constraint on the gluon fragmentation function @xmath64 at large values of @xmath14 currently available .",
    "figure [ fig : star - proton ] shows the results of the fit compared to the data .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties related to a particular choice of the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , in the computation of the nlo cross section , indicated by the shaded bands , are non - negligible .",
    "this has been taken into account in the @xmath2 minimization procedure as a conservative additional 5% relative uncertainty .",
    "we have checked that by excluding data at low @xmath63 values , @xmath67 , the results of the global fit remain essentially unchanged .",
    "the fact that the @xmath63 spectrum is well reproduced down to @xmath68 , the mass of the proton , may turn out to be accidental , but this can only be verified once data at higher @xmath63 become available to map out the @xmath63 slope more precisely .",
    "we note that the brahms data @xcite at very forward rapidities @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 have not been included in our global analysis .",
    "these data show a very pronounced difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 yields which can not be understood .",
    "the origin of the excess of protons over anti - protons by a factor of about 10 , not observed by star at less extreme kinematics , remains an open question @xcite .",
    "finally , a third source of information on the parton - to - proton fragmentation is provided by the opal `` tagging probabilities '' @xmath71 @xcite , also included in the akk fit @xcite but not in @xcite , which are sensitive to the flavor of @xmath72 fragmentation functions .",
    "the @xmath73 represent `` probabilities '' for a quark flavor @xmath4 to produce a `` jet '' containing the ( anti-)proton with a momentum fraction @xmath14 larger than @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : opal - proton - eta ] compares the results from our and the akk fit with the data . as discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite and also mentioned in the discussion of the flavor tagged sld and delphi data above , any flavor tagged information is highly model dependent and difficult to interpret within pqcd beyond the lo approximation involve non trivial theoretical uncertainties . to take this into account",
    ", we assign an up to @xmath75 extra normalization uncertainty to the @xmath71 data in the @xmath2 minimization .",
    "the agreement between opal data and theory is reasonably good .",
    "tables [ tab : nloprotonpara ] and [ tab : expprotontab ] , show the values obtained for the parameters in eq .  ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) specifying the optimum fit of proton fragmentation functions @xmath76 at nlo accuracy and summarize the @xmath2 values for each individual set of data included in the global analysis , respectively . in cases where the normalization uncertainty of the experiment is not included in the error bars of the data , we apply a free normalization factor constrained to vary within range quoted by the experiment .",
    "the values of the normalization factors resulting from the fit are also included in tab .",
    "[ tab : expprotontab ] .",
    ".[tab : expprotontab]data used in the nlo global analysis of proton fragmentation functions , the individual @xmath2 values for each set , the fitted normalizations , and the total @xmath2 of the fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that the pqcd framework based on factorized cross sections can consistently account for a large variety of processes with hadrons in the final - state with remarkable precision , producing at the same time accurate and _ universal _ sets of fragmentation functions .",
    "the availability of these crucial non - perturbative inputs now opens a wide range of possibilities for detailed studies of the nucleon structure at nlo accuracy through single - inclusive hadroproduction processes , encompassing the study of the spin and flavor structure with polarized sidis measurements @xcite , in proton - proton collisions @xcite , and in photoproduction @xcite , the modification of parton densities by nuclear effects @xcite , or studies of high @xmath63 electroproduction processes @xcite .",
    "we warmly acknowledge werner vogelsang for helpful discussions , and carlos garca canal for comments and suggestions .",
    "this work was partially supported by conicet , anpcyt and ubacyt .",
    "for completeness , we have also performed global analyses of the same sets of data given in tables  [ tab : expprotontab ] and [ tab : exprestab ] , where now all observables , @xmath77 , and the scale evolution of the fragmentation functions are computed at lo accuracy .",
    "we use the same parametrization ( [ eq : ff - input ] ) and fitting procedure as in the nlo case , outlined in sec .",
    "the parameters of the optimum lo fits for @xmath78 and @xmath41 are given in tables [ tab : loprotonpara ] and [ tab : lorespara ] while the @xmath2 values obtained for the individual sets of data are compiled in tables  [ tab : expprotonlotab ] and [ tab : loexprestab ] , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that the total @xmath2 of the lo fits is significantly worse than at nlo accuracy , in particular , in case of the inclusive charged hadron data .",
    "our lo sets should be used only for rough estimates of observables where nlo corrections are not yet available , or in event generators based on matrix elements at lo accuracy . because of the limited usefulness of the lo sets , we refrain from going into any further details here .",
