    "superconducting circuits based on josephson junctions  @xcite are currently the most experimentally advanced solid - state qubits . the quantum behavior of these circuits has been experimentally tested at the level of a single qubit  @xcite and of a pair of qubits  @xcite .",
    "the first quantitative experimental study of entanglement in a pair of coupled superconducting qubits was recently reported  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically study quantum information processing for superconducting charge qubits in circuit qed  @xcite , focusing on two - qubit gates . in this system qubits",
    "are coupled to a high q transmission line resonator which acts as a quantum bus .",
    "coupling of superconducting qubits through a quantum bus has already been studied by several authors and in different settings . in particular , coupling using a lumped lc oscillator  @xcite , an extended 1d or 3d resonator  @xcite , a current - biased josephson junction acting as an anharmonic oscillator  @xcite or using a mechanical oscillator  @xcite were studied . here , we focus on circuit qed with charge qubits  @xcite and consider the constraints of the _ current _ experimental design  @xcite .",
    "as we will show , while this architecture is simple , it allows for many different types of qubit - qubit interactions .",
    "these gates have the advantage that they can be realized between non - nearest qubits , possibly spatially separated by several millimeters .",
    "in addition to being interesting from a fundamental point of view , this is highly advantageous in reducing the complexity of multi - qubit algorithms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also helps in reducing the error threshold required for reaching fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of the gates that will be presented allow for parallel operations ( i.e. multiple one and two - qubit gates acting simultaneously on different pairs of qubits ) .",
    "this feature is in fact a requirement for a fault - tolerance threshold to exist  @xcite , and this puts circuit qed on the path for scalable quantum computation .",
    "another aspect addressed in this paper is the ` quality ' of realistic implementations of these gates . to quantify this quality , several measures , like the fidelity ,",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a fair evaluation and comparison of these measures for the different gates however requires extensive numerical calculations including realistic sources of imperfections and optimization of the gate parameters . in this work",
    ", we will rather present estimates for the quality factor  @xcite of the gates as obtained from analytical calculations .",
    "initial numerical calculations have showed that , in most situations , better results than predicted by the analytical estimates can be obtained by optimization .",
    "the quality factors presented here should thus be viewed as lower bounds on what can be achieved in practice .",
    "five types of two - qubit gates will be presented .",
    "first , we discuss in section  [ sec_variable_detuning ] gates that are based on tuning the transition frequency of the qubits in and out of resonance with the resonator by using dc charge or flux bias . as will be discussed , this approach is advantageous because it yields the fastest gates , whose rate given by the resonator - qubit coupling frequency .",
    "a problem with this simple approach is that it takes the qubits out of their charge - degeneracy ` sweet spot ' , which can lead to a substantial increase of their dephasing rates  @xcite .",
    "moreover , changing the qubit transition frequency over a wide range of frequencies can be problematic if the frequency sweep crosses environmental resonances  @xcite .    to address these problems ,",
    "we will focus in this paper on gates that do not require dc excursions away from the sweet spot . requiring that there is",
    "no dc bias is a stringent constraint and the gates that are obtained will typically be slower .",
    "however , the resulting gate quality factor can be larger because of the important gain in dephasing time .",
    "the first of these types of gates rely on virtual excitation of the resonator ( section  [ sec_virtual_gate ] ) .",
    "this type of approach was also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and here we will present various mechanisms to tune this type of interaction . the dispersive regime that is the basis of the schemes relying on virtual excitations of the resonator can also be used to create probabilistic entanglement due to measurement .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ sec_entanglement_by_measurement ] .",
    "next , we consider gates that are based on real photon population of the resonator ( section  [ sec_real_photons ] ) . for these gates , selection rules will set some constraints on the transitions that can be used .",
    "finally , we discuss a gate based on the geometric phase which was first introduced in the context of ion trap quantum computation  @xcite . before moving to two - qubit gates ,",
    "we begin in section  [ sec_circuit_qed_review ] with a brief review of circuit qed and , in section  [ sec_review_1_qubit ] , with a discussion of single - qubit gates .",
    "a table summarizing the expected rates and quality factors for the different gates is presented in the concluding section .",
