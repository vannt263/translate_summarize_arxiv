    "the most influential paradox in fluids is the dalembert paradox saying that a body moving through water has no drag as calculated by dalembert @xcite via inviscid theory , while experiments show that there is a substantial drag on the body .",

    "sommerfeld paradox has the potential of being the next most influential paradox in fluids .",
    "the paradox says that couette flow is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers as first calculated by sommerfeld @xcite , but experiments show that couette flow is unstable when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "this paradox lies at the heart of understanding turbulence inside the infinite dimensional phase space .",
    "dynamical system studies on the navier - stokes flow in an infinite dimensional phase space is still at its developing stage @xcite .",
    "a typical dynamical system study often starts from fixed points ( steady states ) and then pursues their invariant manifolds to understand the phase space structures .",
    "certain techniques e.g. melnikov integrals can then be used to detect the intersection between invariant manifolds and the existence of homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits . in some cases , chaos ( turbulence )",
    "can be rigorously proved to exist using e.g. shadowing techniques @xcite .",
    "due to the large dimensionality of the problem we are having , numerics is often necessary .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a renaissance in numerical dynamical system studies on fluids , especially on the sommerfeld paradox . for plane couette flow ,",
    "plane poiseuille flow , and pipe poiseuille flow , unstable steady states with three dimensional spatial patterns have been intensively explored numerically @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these steady states have a universal  streak - roll - critical layer \" coherent structure often observed in transient turbulence experiments @xcite .",
    "the main criticism on such steady states being responsible for transition from the linear shear to turbulence , comes from the fact that in the phase space these steady states are quite far away from the linear shear .",
    "experiments show that no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is , a transition always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough .    here",
    "we study a sequence of 2d oscillatory shears . these oscillatory shears",
    "are built from single fourier mode modifications to the linear shear .",
    "the sequence of 2d oscillatory shears approaches the linear shear in the velocity variable but not the vorticity variable .",
    "all these oscillatory shears have a linear instability with a non - vanishing growth rate when approaching the linear shear .",
    "we believe that such an instability better explains the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence .",
    "of course , our oscillatory shears are linearly unstable to 3d perturbation modes too . in @xcite , we show that 3d shears in a neighborhood of our oscillatory shear is linearly unstable too .",
    "explorations on two dimensional steady states turn out to be not successful @xcite @xcite .",
    "that is , the counterpart of the 3d upper or lower branch steady state has not been found in 2d . on the other hand ,",
    "numerics shows that transitions still occur from the linear shear to turbulence in 2d .",
    "near the 2d oscillatory shears , inviscid two dimensional steady states ( with a cat s eye structure ) can be established rigorously @xcite .",
    "unsteady viscous cat s eye coherent structures revealed in the current study are viscous continuations of the inviscid steady states .",
    "two dimensional plane couette flow is governed by the navier - stokes equations with specific boundary conditions , @xmath0 defined in a horizontal channel , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are the velocity components along @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , @xmath5 is the pressure , and @xmath6 is the inverse of the reynolds number @xmath7 ; with the boundary condition @xmath8 and all the variables are periodic in @xmath3 . by a theorem of romanov @xcite ,",
    "the couette linear shear ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) is linearly and nonlinearly stable for any reynolds number ( including infinity ) .",
    "the nonlinear stability is in terms of the @xmath11 norm of vorticity . under the 2d euler dynamics , in terms of @xmath11 norm of velocity ,",
    "all the 2d shears are nonlinearly unstable by a theorem of shnirelman @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the sequence of oscillatory shears @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "one can view this as a single mode of the fourier series of all 2d shears satisfying the above boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) , @xmath14 as @xmath15 , the oscillatory shears approach the linear shear @xmath16 . on the other hand , in the vorticity variable , the oscillatory shears do not approach the linear shear @xmath17 .",
    "thus in the velocity variables , the oscillatory shears can be viewed as the linear shear plus small noises .",
    "these oscillatory shears are linearly unstable under the 2d euler flow @xcite when @xmath18 in this case , the oscillatory shears bifurcate into steady states of 2d euler flow with cat s eye structures @xcite .",
    "these claims are in consistency with the romanov s theorem and the shnirelman s theorem mentioned above .",
    "first of all , in the vorticity variable , the oscillatory shear is not in a small neighborhood of the linear shear , while romanov s nonlinear stability only deals with a small neighborhood of the linear shear .",
    "this leaves the room for our oscillatory shears to be linearly and nonlinearly unstable . in the velocity variable ,",
    "our oscillatory shears can be in a small neighborhood of the linear shear , but shnirelman s nonlinear instability result claims that practically all 2d shears ( including the linear shear ) are nonlinearly unstable in the @xmath11 norm of velocity .",
    "such a nonlinear instability is not a result of linear ( exponential ) instability rather some kind of linear in time growth .",
    "such a nonlinear instability does not seem to be responsible for the transition to turbulence observed in experiments .",
    "the @xmath11 norm of velocity is more relevant to weak solutions which have little physical meaning .",
    "we believe that the instability of our oscillatory shears with the peculiar feature of approaching the linear shear in the velocity variable but not in the vorticity variable , offers a better explanation to the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence than the upper and lower branch argument .",
    "the 3d nature of the transition in experiments can be addressed too . of course",
    ", our oscillatory shears are linearly unstable to 3d perturbations .",
    "in fact , 3d shears in a neighborhood of our oscillatory shears are linearly unstable too @xcite .    under the 2d navier - stokes flow ,",
    "these oscillatory shears are not steady , rather slowly drifting , @xmath19 nevertheless by simply using the oscillatory shears ( [ os ] ) under condition ( [ cr ] ) as the potential , the orr - sommerfeld operator ( linear navier - stokes operator ) has unstable eigenvalues which converge to those of linear euler operator as @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "a more precise statement of the sommerfeld paradox is as follows :    * mathematically , the couette shear is linearly and nonlinearly stable for all reynolds number @xmath21 , in fact , all the eigenvalues of the orr - sommerfeld operator satisfy the bound @xmath22 for some constant @xmath23 @xcite . * experimentally , for any @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 in our setting @xcite ) , there exists a threshold amplitude of perturbations , of order @xmath26 where @xmath27 depends on the type of the perturbations @xcite , which leads to turbulence .",
    "our main idea of investigating the oscillatory shears ( [ os ] ) is as follows : the linear instability mentioned above will lead to a transient nonlinear growth near the oscillatory shears ( and the couette shear ) .",
    "such a growth will manifest itself in experiments as transient turbulence . here",
    "the amplitude of the perturbation from the couette shear will be measured by the deviation of the oscillatory shears from the couette shear and the perturbation on top of the oscillatory shears .",
    "for all the simulations , we choose as initial conditions by adding random perturbations to the oscillatory shears ( [ os ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 norm of the random perturbations is @xmath28 .",
    "notice from ( [ cr ] ) that the parameter @xmath13 is in the range ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "for all the simulations , we choose @xmath30 . in order for",
    "the random perturbations not to overwhelm the oscillatory part of our oscillatory shear ( [ os ] ) , @xmath31 needs to be less than @xmath32 .",
    "here we shall simulate @xmath33 .    from ( [ cr ] ) and ( [ sdr ] ) , we see that the time @xmath34 for the oscillatory shear to drift outside its unstable regime ( [ cr ] ) can be estimated by @xmath35 that is , @xmath36 this time scale agrees well with the time scale of the first pulse in the @xmath11 norm evolution of the random perturbations . for example , in the setting of figure [ grth2](a ) , @xmath37 which almost coincides with the duration of the first pulse . in figure",
    "[ cod ] , we show a few time flashes of the velocity field evolution .",
    "one can see clearly the development of streak and wave modes .",
    "if we chose 3d random perturbations , we would have observed the roll mode too . as mentioned before , the streak - roll - wave modes are generic from the fourier series expansion .",
    "the point we want to stress here is that the linear instability of our oscillatory shears ( and their 3d neighborhood ) provides the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence . in figure",
    "[ grth ] , we show the velocity @xmath11 norm deviation of the solution from the linear shear .",
    "one can see the development of pulses . as mentioned above",
    ", the duration of the first pulse agrees with the time scale ( [ ts ] ) for the oscillatory shear to drift outside its unstable regime . comparing figure [ cod ] with figure [ grth](a )",
    ", one can see that the development of streak - wave structure in figure [ cod ] corresponds to the development of the first pulse in figure [ grth](a ) .",
    "we can measure the growth rate of the uphill of the first pulse .",
    "for example in figure [ grth](a ) , let @xmath38 be the first minimum , @xmath39 be the first maximum , and @xmath40 be the duration from the first minimum to the first maximum , then the exponential growth rate @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 this exponential growth rate measures the exponential growth in time , of the initial deviation from the linear shear . in the cases we simulated , the exponential growth rate can be as large as @xmath43 .",
    "the exponential growth rate here can also be regarded as a measure on how fast the flow is initially leaving the linear shear to transient turbulence . in figure",
    "[ grth2 ] , we show the velocity @xmath11 norm deviation of the same solution but from the moving frame of the slow drifting of the oscillatory shear ( [ sdr ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the velocity field given by ( [ sdr ] ) . comparing figure [ grth ] and figure [ grth2 ]",
    ", one can see that the time instant of the peak of the first pulse agrees quite well for @xmath45 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the initial random perturbations almost overwhelm the oscillatory part of the oscillatory shear .",
    "that is why the agreement is not that good .",
    "such an agreement shows that the first pulse is generated by the linear instability of our oscillatory shear ; and the slow drifting ( [ sdr ] ) has very little effect on the development of the first pulse . we can also measure the exponential growth rate of the uphill of the first pulse as for figure [ grth ] using the same definition ( [ gr ] ) . here",
    "the exponential growth rate approximates the unstable eigenvalue of our oscillatory shear .",
    "one can see that all the exponential growth rates in figure [ grth2 ] are very close to each other .",
    "when @xmath31 is the same and the reynolds number @xmath21 is different , this fact is expected since the unstable eigenvalue of our oscillatory shear approaches its inviscid unstable eigenvalue as @xmath47 . figure [ grth2 ] also reveals that the unstable eigenvalue does not depend on @xmath31 substantially .",
    "this fact is very important .",
    "it says that as @xmath31 increases , our oscillatory shear approaches the linear shear , at the same time maintaining a non - shrinking growth rate .",
    "this implies that no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is , a transition always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "the invariant manifold argument of the 3d steady states can not offer such a good explanation .",
    "the exponential growth rate here measures how fast the initial random perturbation grows when observed on the moving frame of the slow drifting ( [ sdr ] ) toward the linear shear .",
    "next we explains why we observe pulses in figures [ grth ] and [ grth2 ] .",
    "the uphill of the pulse is generated by nonlinear growth induced by the unstable eigenvalues . since",
    "our reynolds number is quite large , the navier - stokes equation is  near \" the euler equation , and there is a stable eigenvalue corresponding to an unstable eigenvalue due to the near conservativeness .",
    "the stable eigenvalue corresponds to the downhill of the pulse .",
    "concerning other pulses in figures [ grth ] and [ grth2 ] , e.g. figure [ grth2](e)(f ) , since the random perturbations in these cases almost overwhelm the oscillatory part of our oscillatory shear , other instability sources play significant roles .",
    "the first pulse is due to the linear instability of our oscillatory shear .",
    "when the first pulse is finished , our oscillatory shear has drifted outside its unstable regime ( [ sdr ] ) , but the new transient state can pick further instability and develop even higher pulses .",
    "this further illustrates our point that the linear instability of our oscillatory shear serves as the initiator for transition to turbulence .",
    "finally , it is always tempting to try to apply the tools of dynamical systems to characterize turbulence .",
    "one promising tool is the melnikov integral . in @xcite",
    ", we built the melnikov integral for the 2d kolmogorov flow ( i.e. with periodic boundary conditions in both spatial directions and an artificial force ) .",
    "the melnikov integral there was built from the kinetic energy and enstrophy , and evaluated along a heteroclinic orbit .",
    "for the couette flow , we have not found any proper heteroclinic orbit .",
    "nevertheless , we can still investigate the modulation of the kinetic energy and enstrophy .",
    "when @xmath48 , the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) reduces to just the non - penetrating condition @xmath49 a direct calculation shows that the kinetic energy @xmath50 and the enstrophy @xmath51 are invariant under the euler dynamics . when @xmath52 , they are no longer invariant , but their time derivatives @xmath53 and @xmath54 should be small for small @xmath6 : @xmath55 in figure [ eg ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 along the orbit in figure [ cod ] . due to the high - frequncy oscillation nature of the oscillatory part of our oscillatory shear ( [ os ] ) ,",
    "the modulation of the enstrophy ( characterized by @xmath54 ) is about @xmath58 times of that of the knietic ennergy .",
    "this shows that during the initiation of transition to turbulence , there has been a massive vorticity production .",
    "we introduced a new theory concerning the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence in contrast to the invariant manifold argument of 3d steady states for the couette flow .",
    "our theory focuses on high spatial frequency single fourier mode modifications to the linear shear , resulting in a sequence of oscillatory shears with the following peculiar features :    1 .",
    "the sequence of oscillatory shears approaches the linear shear in the velocity variable but not the vorticity variable , 2 .",
    "the sequence of oscillatory shears are linearly unstable .",
    "as the sequence of oscillatory shears approaches the linear shear , their linear growth rate does not shrink to zero .",
    "our theory claims that such a linear instability offers a better explanation for the initiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence , than the invariant manifold argument of 3d steady states ( upper or lower branch ) @xcite .",
    "the main criticism of the 3d steady state argument is that these steady states locate quite far away from the linear shear in the phase space ; while experiments show that no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is , a transition always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "the numerical simulations in this study confirm our theory .",
    "the 2d nature of our study is not a limitation .",
    "in fact , 3d shears in a neighborhood of our oscillatory shears are linearly unstable too @xcite , and our oscillatory shears are linearly unstable to 3d perturbations also . the key point for answering the sommerfeld paradox",
    "is whether or not there is a linear instability happening arbitrarily close to the linear shear ."
