    "the process of renormalization is governed by the forest formula , as derived for example in @xcite .",
    "the underlying combinatorics is directly related to the hopf algebra structure of rooted trees .",
    "this is evident in the case of feynman diagrams which only provide nested or disjoint subdivergences .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the same hopf algebra appears in the study of overlapping divergences .",
    "this was already shown using schwinger dyson equations @xcite , or by explicit considerations of divergent sectors @xcite , or differential equations on bare green functions @xcite .",
    "at such a level , one obtains a resolution of overlapping divergent graphs into a sum of rooted trees , to which then the combinatorics of the hopf algebra of rooted trees applies @xcite .",
    "it was suggested to construct a hopf algebra which directly considers overlapping divergent graphs , without using external input as schwinger dyson equations @xcite .",
    "however , as already mentioned in @xcite , this leads to the same hopf algebra as for the case of non - overlapping divergences , as we will prove by set - theoretic considerations .",
    "in this section we first repeat the definition of the hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees , as it can be found in @xcite .",
    "the rooted trees provide sets of vertices connected by edges .",
    "the vertices are labelled by decorations .",
    "each decoration corresponds to an analytic expression with a non - vanishing superficial degree of divergence , but free of subdivergences .",
    "such analytic expressions are typically obtained from general feynman graphs by shrinking superficially divergent subgraphs to a point .",
    "if for example @xmath1 is a superficially divergent feynman graph which contains only one divergent subgraph @xmath2 , then one usually denotes by @xmath3 the expression in which @xmath2 is reduced to a point in @xmath1 .",
    "when we speak of feynman graphs in the following , this includes such quotients @xmath3 .",
    "the hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees , with vertices labelled by feynman graphs free of subdivergences , is equivalent to the hopf algebra on parenthesized words introduced in @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we embark on some set - theoretic considerations , which will prove useful in the study of overlapping divergences .",
    "in particular , we will assign a unique rooted tree to a set @xmath4 by imposing conditions on its subsets .",
    "we follow section ii of @xcite . a _ rooted tree _",
    "@xmath5 is a connected and simply - connected set of oriented edges and vertices such that there is precisely one distinguished vertex which has no incoming edge .",
    "this vertex is called the root of @xmath5 .",
    "further , every edge connects two vertices and the _ fertility _ @xmath6 of a vertex @xmath7 is the number of edges outgoing from @xmath7 .",
    "the trees being simply - connected , each vertex apart from the root has a single incoming edge .    as in @xcite",
    ", we consider the ( commutative ) algebra of polynomials over @xmath8 in rooted trees , hence the multiplication @xmath9 of two rooted trees means drawing them next to each other in arbitrary order .    note that for any rooted tree @xmath5 with root @xmath10 we have @xmath11 trees @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 which are the trees attached to @xmath10 .",
    "the unit element of this algebra is @xmath15 , corresponding , as a rooted tree , to the empty set .",
    "let @xmath16 be the operator which removes the root @xmath10 from a tree @xmath5 : @xmath17 fig.([guill- ] ) gives an example .",
    "let @xmath18 the operation which maps a monomial of @xmath19 rooted trees to a new rooted tree @xmath5 which has a root @xmath10 with fertility @xmath20 which connects to the @xmath19 roots of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 this is clearly the inverse to the action of @xmath16 .",
    "one has @xmath23 for any rooted tree @xmath5 .",
    "fig.([guill+ ] ) gives an example .",
    "for convenience , we define the rooted trees @xmath24 to be the trees with one , two or three vertices , given in fig.(5 ) on the lhs from top to bottom .",
    "we further set @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "we will introduce a hopf algebra on such rooted trees by using the possibility to cut such trees in pieces .",
    "we start with the most elementary possibility",
    "elementary cut _ is a cut of a rooted tree at a single chosen edge , as indicated in fig.([ecut ] ) .",
    "by such a cutting procedure , we will obtain the possibility to define a coproduct , as we can use the resulting pieces on either side of the coproduct .",
    "but before doing so we finally introduce the notion of an _ admissible cut _ , also called a _",
    "simple cut_. it is any assignment of elementary cuts to a rooted tree @xmath5 such that any path from any vertex of the tree to the root has at most one elementary cut . fig.([cut ] ) gives an example .",
    "an admissible cut @xmath27 maps a tree to a monomial in trees .",
    "if the cut @xmath27 contains @xmath19 elementary cuts , it induces a map @xmath28    note that precisely one of these trees @xmath29 will contain the root of @xmath5 .",
    "let us denote this distinguished tree by @xmath30 .",
    "the monomial which is delivered by the @xmath31 other factors is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the definitions of @xmath33 can be extended to monomials of trees in the obvious manner , by choosing a cut @xmath34 for every tree @xmath29 in the monomial : @xmath35    let us now establish the hopf algebra structure .",
    "following @xcite we define the counit and the coproduct .",
    "the _ counit _",
    "@xmath36 : @xmath37 is simple : @xmath38 for any @xmath39 , @xmath40    the _ coproduct _ @xmath41 is defined by the equations @xmath42,\\label{cop2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines the coproduct on trees with @xmath19 vertices iteratively through the coproduct on trees with a lesser number of vertices .",
    "the coproduct can be written as @xcite @xmath43    up to now we have established a bialgebra structure .",
    "it is actually a hopf algebra .",
    "following @xcite we find the antipode @xmath44 as @xmath45r^c(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us give yet another formula to write the antipode , which one easily derives using induction on the number of vertices @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of single cuts in @xmath27 .",
    "this time , we have a non - recursive expression , summing over all cuts @xmath27 , relaxing the restriction to admissible cuts .",
    "by now we have established a hopf algebra on rooted trees , using the set of rooted trees , the commutative multiplication @xmath48 for elements of this set , the unit @xmath15 and counit @xmath36 , the coproduct @xmath41 and antipode @xmath44 .",
    "we call this hopf algebra @xmath0 .",
    "still following @xcite we allow to label the vertices of rooted trees by feynman graphs without subdivergences , in the sense described before .    quite general , if @xmath49 is a set of primitive elements providing labels , we call the resulting hopf algebra @xmath50 .",

    "we finally note the following definition : for a rooted tree @xmath5 let @xmath55 be the number of its vertices .",
    "this extends to a monomial of rooted trees in the obvious manner , @xmath56 .    ultimately , we work in the vector space of finite linear combinations of monomials in rooted trees .",

    "characteristically , the two overlapping subdivergences can be eleminated by two derivatives with respect to an external momentum , one for each of them .",
    "this then generates new decorations of logarithmic degree of divergence .",
    "an illuminating example for this situation is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "overlapping degrees of divergences can come in other degrees of divergence , and in other configurations .",
    "for example , in non - abelian yang - mills theory one can have overlapping divergent feynman graphs with a logarithmic degree of divergence , where one has three sets which mutually overlap with each other .",
    "starting from set - theoretic notions , we showed how the forest formula underlying renormalization theory is _ ad initio _ derived from the hopf algebra of rooted trees . at the same time",
    ", we constructed a systematic way how to obtain the skeleton expansion in any qft , given by elements @xmath211 .",
    "we derived the original non - recursive forest formula of zimmermann from the hopf algebra of rooted trees , as well as the recursive formulation .",
    "the results of @xcite are in full accordance with our results and are a specification of the general result presented here .",
    "details for the practitioner of calculational qft are given elsewhere @xcite , including remarkable number - theoretic results when investigating the role of the connes - moscovici hopf subalgebra in feynman diagrams .",
    "some further remarks are in order .    *",
    "the methods developped in the first section are sufficiently general to be applied to problems of operator product expansions and asymptotic expansions , with applications to ope s already being established @xcite .",
    "our approach being based on set - theoretic considerations , the remaining challenge for general asymptotic expansions is to find and interpret sensible conditions @xmath63 , and to identify the resulting primitive elements . * the hopf algebra of rooted trees has relations to shuffle hopf algebras @xcite .",
    "shuffle products play a role when we start to study the action of the symmetric group on decorations .",
    "they appear naturally in the consideration of the sub hopf algebra generated by trees @xmath352 , which is the hopf algebra underlying chen s iterated integral .",
    "the hopf algebra of rooted trees has this algebra as a sub hopf algebra .",
    "there are interesting generalizations when we study shuffle algebras and iterated integrals from the viewpoint of the hopf algebra of rooted trees @xcite .",
    "especially , the absence of a shuffle product for bare green functions in the presence of a remaining convolution law points to interesting structures lying ahead @xcite . * the general set - theoretic set - up",
    "adopted in this paper allows to study bare green functions in @xmath353-space , and hence will allow to study them as functions on configuration space ( which relies on tree - ordered boundaries in a natural manner , see e.g.@xcite and references there ) .",
    "this will hopefully reconcile early work on such functions @xcite with more recent developments .",
    "let me first thank raymond stora for interest and discussions , and for the ultimate motivation to write this paper . also , i thank him for carefully proofreading an earlier version of this paper .",
