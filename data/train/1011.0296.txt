    ", we can predict the final condensate fraction for a given dimple depth for both the quasistatic and sudden turn - on . we perform a quantitative comparison of experiment and theory for a thermodynamic transformation through the bec phase transition in an interacting bose gas .",
    "second , we observe the dynamics of condensate formation following sudden turn - on of the dimple potential and compare with a quantum kinetic model of condensate growth . this configuration allows a quantitative comparison with theory for condensate formation without evaporative cooling .",
    "we note that this scenario has been studied previously using stochastic classical fields in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we summarize our experimental setup and procedure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermo ] we present our study of equilibrium thermodynamics by comparing the theoretical predictions with our experimental data and discussing the results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] , we present our study of condensate formation dynamics , first providing details of our quantum kinetic theory , and then comparing the theoretical predictions with our experimental data and discussing results .",
    "we finish with conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conc ] , and we provide additional theoretical details in the appendices .",
    "our experiments are performed on a gas of ultracold @xmath3rb atoms in the @xmath4 state , confined in a magnetic harmonic potential provided by a z - wire configuration on an atom chip , as previously described in ref .",
    "briefly , we collect @xmath5 atoms in a reflection mot before transferring them to a magnetic trap at a distance of 200  @xmath6 m below the chip surface with axial and transverse frequencies of our cylindrically symmetric trapping potential @xmath7  hz . using rf evaporation we cool to near quantum degeneracy before decreasing the bias magnetic field to move the trap to 430  @xmath6 m below the chip surface , with a resulting decrease in trapping frequencies to @xmath8  hz such that the resulting system is more three dimensional and less susceptible to phase fluctuations that exist in elongated condensates in the tighter trap  @xcite .",
    "further evaporative cooling results in a cloud of @xmath9  @xmath10 atoms .",
    "we go as close as we can to the bec transition while remaining above the transition temperature .",
    "this ensures the largest possible condensate fraction when the dimple potential is subsequently turned on .     along the axial dimension",
    "then consists of a wide harmonic potential plus a narrow gaussian dimple potential , while the potential in the other two spatial dimensions is unaffected.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    starting from these initial conditions , we next apply a red - detuned @xmath11 nm optical dipole potential to the system , intersecting the weak ( @xmath12 ) direction of the magnetic trap at the center as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimple ] .",
    "this dipole beam is known by direct charge - coupled device ( ccd ) imaging to be gaussian and diffraction limited . by observing the effect of shifting the focus back and forth along the @xmath13 dimension",
    ", we ensured the magnetic trap intersects the beam waist .",
    "the beam can be focused to two different @xmath14 half - widths in the @xmath12 dimension , thereby creating either a wide ( 32 @xmath6 m ) or a narrow ( 11 @xmath6 m ) dimple potential .",
    "this should be compared to the typical thermal cloud extent of @xmath15 @xmath6 m near the critical temperature .",
    "a cylindrical lens is used to expand the beam to widths of 350  @xmath6 m ( wide ) or 220  @xmath6 m ( narrow ) in the perpendicular dimension compared to the cloud width of 6  @xmath6 m , such that the intensity is approximately constant in these dimensions .",
    "thus the cylindrically symmetric trapping potential can be approximated by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath14 half - width and the optical potential depth @xmath18 is proportional to the peak laser intensity @xmath19 , and can reach a maximum depth of @xmath20 nk ( wide ) or 1610 nk ( narrow ) .",
    "the other relevant parameters are the scattering cross sections @xmath21 , linewidths @xmath22 , the resonant frequencies @xmath23 of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 lines in @xmath3rb , and the laser frequency @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "our measurements are performed using absorption imaging after a time of flight of 20.3 ms , after turning off all trapping potentials .",
    "the temperature is determined by fitting a thermal cloud distribution to the wings of the resulting image , and the condensate fraction is determined from a two - component fit to the density .",
    "the condensate is sufficiently dense that condensate fractions of less that 1% can be distinguished from the thermal background .",
    "in our first set of experiments , we apply dimples of various depths and measure the resulting final equilibrium temperatures and condensate fractions .",
    "we do this for both wide and narrow dimples , and for both quasistatic and sudden turn - on .",
    "we then compare our measured values with the predictions of semiclassical hartree - fock theory , incorporating full mean - field interactions of both the condensate and thermal cloud , as well as accounting for the effects of three - body loss .",
    "while it is widely assumed that this is appropriate for the three - dimensional bose gas , there have been relatively few comprehensive comparisons with experimental data aside from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we determine the initial entropy @xmath27 and total energy @xmath28 prior to dimple turn - on [ @xmath29 , given the experimentally measured initial temperature and atom number , using the semiclassical theory as outlined in appendix  [ sec : sc ] .",
    "to predict the final state , in the case of quasistatic turn - on we assume the system evolves isentropically and solve for the final temperature at which @xmath30 . in the case of sudden turn - on ,",
    "we use the initial density to calculate the sudden change in energy imparted by the dimple , @xmath31 \\mathrm{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the densities of the condensate and thermal cloud , respectively .",
    "we then solve for the final temperature at which @xmath34 , which determines the final condensate fraction .",
    "we also estimate the effects of three - body loss in our calculations , as detailed in appendix  [ sec:3b ] .",
    "our experimental procedure is as follows . for the wide dimple measurements , we begin with an atomic cloud of @xmath35 atoms at a temperature of @xmath36  nk .",
    "this corresponds to a phase - space density at the center of the trap of @xmath37 , indicating that the cloud is very close to the bec transition ( @xmath38 ) . to turn on the dimple quasistatically",
    ", we ramp up the dimple potential linearly at a rate of 70@xmath39s , and then hold it constant for a 300-ms equilibration time before turning off all potentials and imaging . to ensure that we are in the quasistatic regime",
    ", we have repeated this process for various ramp rates : for faster rates we observe a decrease in condensate fraction at large dimple depths due to nonadiabatic heating . to turn on the dimple suddenly",
    ", we ramp up the potential in less than 0.1  ms , and then hold it constant for a 1000-ms equilibration time before imaging .",
    "the resulting temperatures and condensate fractions are plotted versus final dimple depth and compared with the predictions of semiclassical theory in fig .",
    "[ fig : wide ] .",
    "we find good agreement between theory and experiment for both the quasistatic and sudden turn - on , with the best fits obtained using initial conditions @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath41  nk . we also find the results of the quasistatic and sudden turn - on to be nearly indistinguishable from each other .",
    "this is because only a small fraction of the atoms are drawn from the harmonic trap into the wide dimple , which has a maximum attainable depth of order @xmath42 .",
    "we compare the predictions of the semiclassical theory with our experimental data for both wide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wide ] ) and narrow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow ] ) dimples .",
    "we plot temperature and condensate fraction versus dimple depth for both quasistatic and sudden turn - on . in all cases , the only fitting parameters used to generate the theoretical curves are the initial temperature and atom number , constrained to lie within their respective measurement uncertainties .      using the more tightly focused narrow dimple",
    ", we are able to attain a maximum depth much greater than @xmath43 and thereby observe differences between quasistatic and sudden turn - on . for the quasistatic turn - on we begin with an atomic cloud of @xmath44 atoms at a temperature of @xmath45  nk ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we ramp up the dimple potential linearly over a time of 1500  ms , and then hold the potential constant for a 300-ms equilibration time before imaging .",
    "for the sudden turn - on we begin with an atomic cloud of @xmath46 atoms at a temperature of @xmath47  nk ( @xmath48 ) and follow the same procedure as for the wide dimple .",
    "nk to measure the standard deviation of the mean.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the resulting temperatures and condensate fractions are plotted versus final dimple depth and compared with theory in fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow ] . in this case",
    "we observe a significant difference between the results of quasistatic and sudden turn - on , though this is partly due to the difference in initial conditions .",
    "we find good agreement between theory and experiment for the quasistatic turn - on , with the best fits obtained using initial conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50  nk .    however , we do not find good agreement for the sudden turn - on , with theory predicting a much smaller condensate fraction than was experimentally observed . the best fit shown is for @xmath51 and @xmath52  nk , though better fits can be obtained by using values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 that lie outside their respective measurement uncertainties .",
    "a potential explanation for this discrepancy is that the turn - on is not sufficiently quick , and the density of the gas is not frozen during the turn - on .",
    "this would result in a smaller increase in total energy of the gas compared to the prediction of our model , leading to a smaller increase in temperature and hence a larger condensate fraction  as is observed experimentally .",
    "indeed , in the limit of quasistatic turn - on from the same initial conditions ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow ] ) , the predicted condensate fraction is considerably larger than for sudden turn - on .",
    "since the measured values lie between the limits of quasistatic and sudden turn - on , an intermediate turn - on time would likely provide a good fit to the data .    to model",
    "this would require a fully dynamical treatment that is beyond the limitations of our semiclassical theory and is numerically impractical within the quantum kinetic model we introduce later in sec .",
    "[ sec : qk ] .",
    "furthermore , departures from the sudden case would only be expected at turn - on times similar to the time scale for rethermalization .",
    "since the mean free time between collisions at initial conditions is approximately 6 ms , whereas the time for sudden turn - on is less than 0.1 ms , this explanation seems unlikely .",
    "we are therefore unfortunately forced to leave this discrepancy unresolved .",
    "an interesting feature of the narrow dimple data is that there exists an optimal dimple depth ( @xmath55  @xmath56 ) at which a maximum condensate fraction is obtained . as the dimple depth",
    "is increased beyond this value , the condensate fraction gradually decreases back toward zero",
    ". we can understand this feature in the context of the condensate formation process as follows . at shallow depths ,",
    "the dimple potential acts merely as a perturbation to the broader harmonic trap . to a first approximation",
    "the chemical potential and temperature are unchanged , whereas the energy of the translational ground state is decreased relative to the bottom of the harmonic trap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilonmu ] ) .",
    "when the ground - state energy approaches the chemical potential , a condensate forms , as observed for the wide dimple and at shallow depths of the narrow dimple .",
    "however , at larger depths a significant fraction of the thermal cloud is drawn into the narrow dimple , causing non - negligible changes in @xmath6 and @xmath57 . at sufficiently large depths",
    ", the entire thermal cloud falls into the dimple potential ( which is approximately harmonic near its center ) and the condensate evaporates , in agreement with the well - known result that compression of a gas can not alter the phase - space density  @xcite .    .",
    "before the dimple is turned on ( solid lines ) , as the system temperature is above @xmath58 the chemical potential @xmath6 lies below the translational ground state energy @xmath59 of the harmonic trap .",
    "when the dimple is turned on ( dashed lines ) , the new ground state energy @xmath60 lies below the initial chemical potential , inducing condensation .",
    "due to interactions , the energy @xmath60 increases as the condensate grows until equilibrium is reached ( @xmath61).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "in our second set of experiments , we suddenly turn on the dimple and allow the system to evolve for various times before measuring the condensate fraction .",
    "we do this for both wide and narrow dimples , in each case for two different fixed dimple depths : one shallow and the other deep .",
    "we then compare our measured values with the predictions of quantum kinetic theory .",
    "in particular , we use the ergodic quantum boltzmann equation  @xcite with the additional inclusion of the effects of the condensate mean - field  @xcite and three - body loss .",
    "while similar comparisons have been made previously  @xcite the condensation transitions in these experiments were induced by evaporative cooling . here",
    "condensation is introduced without loss by modifying the density of states of the trap .",
    "the initial equilibrium state of the bose gas above @xmath58 becomes nonequilibrium following the sudden turn - on of a dimple potential .",
    "we begin by calculating this initial nonequilibrium state , and then evolve it in time to final equilibrium using an ergodic quantum boltzmann equation ( eqbe ) , as previously described in  @xcite .",
    "the ergodic assumption is that all semiclassical states for a given single - particle energy @xmath62 have the same mean occupation and thus the nonequilibrium phase - space distribution function depends only on time and energy : @xmath63 .",
    "hence the position and momentum dependence in the full quantum boltzmann equation is projected out , yielding a partial differential equation in energy and time only .",
    "the ergodic approximation is necessary in order to reduce the dimensionality of the phase space to render the quantum boltzmann equation computationally tractable .",
    "the eqbe then governs the evolution of the energy density @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy distribution function and @xmath66 is the density of states .",
    "the semiclassical excitation energy @xmath67 is as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eth ] ) but with the mean field of the thermal cloud neglected [ i.e. ,  setting @xmath68 to zero ] .",
    "this eliminates the need to determine the densities self - consistently , and our results suggest that this approximation is reasonable . the condensate mean field",
    "is calculated via the thomas - fermi approximation , as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : tf ] ) , but again neglecting the mean field of the thermal cloud .",
    "we provide a more detailed description of the eqbe in appendix  [ sec : eqbe ] and describe how to incorporate the effects of three - body loss in appendix  [ sec:3b ] .",
