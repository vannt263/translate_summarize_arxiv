    "a decade ago a mysterious new class of millisecond - duration radio transients called fast radio bursts ( frbs ) were discovered @xcite .",
    "frbs are highly dispersed , bright ( @xmath3 ) , and ( some of them ) highly polarized bursts @xcite . since the first discovery , twenty - six frbs have been discovered and eighteen have been published .",
    "the significant excess in dispersion measure ( dm ) implies that the sources are at cosmological distances , e.g. in the redshift range @xmath4 .",
    "the isotropic energy release of frbs is estimated to be in the range of @xmath5 erg .    out of these detected frbs ,",
    "one source , frb 121102 ( also known as the `` repeater '' ) , clearly repeats @xcite .",
    "thanks to its repeating behavior , a radio nebula associated with the source was detected @xcite and a star formation host galaxy at @xmath0 was identified @xcite , which provides solid evidence of the cosmological origin of frbs .",
    "most of other frbs have been closely monitored since their discoveries , but so far no positive detection of a repeating burst has been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possible exception might be the frb 110220 / frb 140514 pair , which are in the same 14.4 arcmin beam and are 9 arcmin apart .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that they may originate from the same neutron star embedded within a supernova remnant ( snr ) that provides an evolving dm as the ejecta expands .",
    "a detection of a third burst with an even smaller dm from this location would support this hypothesis . in any case , it is believed by many that other frbs are not much different from the repeater , and the non - detection of the repeating bursts from those sources might be due to the lower sensitivity of the parkes telescope ( which detected most of the frbs ) than the arecibo 300-m telescope ( which detected many bursts of the repeater ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , it has been also suggested that there might be more than one class of frbs : e.g. repeating and non - repeating ones @xcite .",
    "many frb progenitor models have been proposed in the literature .",
    "some models invoke non - catastrophic events such as giant magnetar flares @xcite , giant pulses from young pulsars @xcite and young rapidly - spinning magnetars @xcite , repeated material captures of asteroids by neutron stars @xcite , and `` cosmic combing '' events when astrophysical streams interact with the magnetosphere of an old neutron star @xcite .",
    "these models may be relevant to repeating frbs .",
    "alternatively , other classes of models invoke catastrophic events , such as the collapse of supra - massive neutron stars ( the so - called  blitzars \" ) @xcite and mergers of compact stars ( ns - ns , ns - bh , bh - bh ) @xcite .",
    "the frbs produced from these systems would not repeat .    in this paper , we use the published detection data of the repeating frb 121102 and the non - detection data of other frbs to investigate whether frb 121102 is representative of frbs in terms of its repeating behavior .",
    "if other frbs also repeat but no repeating bursts are detected , there could be due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the repeating time interval ( duty cycle ) is long , and the current observation time is not long enough to catch another one yet ; ( 2 ) the other repeating bursts have occurred , but are too faint to be detected by the searching telescopes ( e.g. parkes ) . in order to quantify these two effects , we introduce two parameters : the time interval between bursts , @xmath1 , and the peak flux ratio between two adjacent bursts , @xmath6 .",
    "one trouble in defining a time interval between repeating bursts is that the observations are usually not continuous ( this is the case for both repeating bursts and other nn - repeating frbs ) . due to telescope constraints , it is essentially impossible to continuously observe one source long enough to test the repetitive behavior of the frb source . in our analysis , we define the _ observed _ time interval between bursts as the time interval which dismisses all the time periods during which no observations were performed .",
    "if frb bursts happen randomly in time , such an effective duration would give a good reflection of the repetitive behavior of the source .",
    "the bursting behavior of frb 121102 is not completely random , which shows an episodic behavior , e.g. when repeating bursts occur , they occur in groups . however , if there are enough observational epochs each with long enough durations , such episodic behavior would be smoothed out . lacking better ways to quantify the time intervals between bursts , we adopt the observed time interval , @xmath1 , to delineate the duty cycle of frbs .    for the repeating frb 121102",
    ", the first burst was discovered in the palfa survey at 1.4 ghz .",
    "later an extensive follow - up observation using arecibo resulted in the detection of 10 more bursts .",
    "another six bursts from this source were later detected and published : five from green bank telescope at 2.0 ghz and one at 1.4 ghz with the arecibo observatory . in our analysis , we include altogether a total of 17 bursts based on the published signature , even though by now @xmath8 bursts from this source have been detected , but are not published yet ( l. spitler , 2017 , talk presented at the aspen frb conference ) . including 140 bursts in our analysis will only strengthen the conclusion of this paper .",
    "bursts from this source are very irregular and clustered in time ( non - poissionian distribution ) @xcite . the total telescope time spent on",
    "frb121102 was over 70 hours for the observations of the 17 bursts .",
    "of the 17 bursts , six bursts were found within a 10 min of observing period and additional four were detected in a 20-min observing window @xcite .",
    "the total observing time is spread over telescopes with different sensitivities and the observations were done on different radio frequencies . for completeness",
    ", we include all the bursts regardless of telescope and frequency .",
    "the time intervals @xmath1 are calculated for each pair of adjacent bursts defined by the sequence numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "table [ tab : observing time ] presents @xmath1 of all adjacent pairs of the bursts , which are also presented in figure [ fig : frb_ts1 ] .    other frbs ( detected by parkes and gbt ) have been extensively followed up on a variety range of timescales , some with dozens or even hundreds of hours of observational times .",
    "no additional bursts have been detected .",
    "we include all the observational times _ after _ the detection of the original burst and define it as the lower limit of @xmath1 .",
    "the data are shown in table [ tab : observing time ] and presented in figure [ fig : frb_ts1 ] .",
    "the flux ratio is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the peak flux of @xmath14th and @xmath15-th burst .",
    "it is greater / less than one if the next frb is fainter / brighter . for non - detections ,",
    "one may set a lower limit of ratio based on the sensitivity of the telescopes .",
    "the peak fluxes and pulse widths for each burst from frb 121102 are very different . for completeness",
    ", we include all the bursts to define @xmath16 , most of which were detected at 1.4 ghz , but some of which were detected at 2 ghz .",
    "they are presented in figure [ fig : frb_ts1 ] .    for other frbs ,",
    "since no repeating bursts have been detected , any possible burst during the observation time frame , if any , must have a peak flux that is faint enough to evade detection .",
    "for these frbs , instead of plotting @xmath16 , we plot @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 above the background flux .",
    "this is because if a signal is @xmath19 above the background , it would be regarded as a `` detection '' .",
    "the raw @xmath20 plot is shown in figure [ fig : frb_ts1 ] .",
    "one can immediately see that the bursts from the repeating frb 121102 are located at a very different region ( lower left region of the plot ) from other frbs in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the time intervals between bursts are much shorter , and the flux ratios are smaller , some of them are even less than unity ( suggesting that the later burst is brighter than the earlier one ) .",
    "other frbs , on the other hand , are located in the upper right region of the plot . since we used the non - detection limits to place those frbs in the plot , the true region of those frbs",
    "are even pushed further towards right .",
    "we tentatively draw the conclusion that frb 121102 is special and not representative of other frbs .    assuming that frb 110220 and frb 140514 belong to the same source , as argued by @xcite , we plot another point ( purple square ) based on the detected values .",
    "this point sits between the region of frb 121102 and the region of other frbs . on the other hand",
    ", the non - detection of other bursts following frb 140514 again places the second point of the source to the region of other frbs .",
    "if the hypothesis is confirmed by future observations , frb 110220/140514 would be an intermediate source between the most frequent repeater frb 121102 and other frbs .",

    "+      since arecibo is more sensitive than parkes , a more rigorous treatment of the repeating frb 121102 should include only those bursts that are above the parkes sensitivity threshold and are detected in the 1.4 ghz band for a fair comparison with the results of other frbs .",
    "the peak flux density ( for pulse widths ranging from @xmath22 ms using signal to noise ratio of 7.0 ) of parkes are in the range @xmath23 jy . out of 12 repeating bursts from frb 121102 at 1.4 ghz , two bursts ( bursts number 7 and bursts number 11 ) are above the parkes s / n cutoff limit .",
    "both bursts 7 and 11 were originally detected by arecibo within a 10 min observation window @xcite .",
    "parkes radio telescope would easily detect these two bursts .",
    "we therefore skip bursts 8 , 9 , and 10 ( pretend that they were not detected ) and redefine @xmath1 and @xmath11 and plot it in figure [ fig : ts2 ] . out of the 5 bursts detected by gbt at 2 ghz",
    ", one of them ( number 16 ) would be detectable by parkes for a flat spectrum .",
    "the spectral indices of the repeating bursts of frb 121102 vary significantly from burst to burst @xcite , so it is hard to reliably extrapolate the 2 ghz flux to 1.4 ghz . for indicative purpose , we assume a flat spectrum ( spectral index 0 ) and include burst number 16 to plot a second point in figure [ fig : ts2 ] . finally , with `` non - detection '' after burst number 16 , we draw another lower - limit point for the repeater similar to other frbs .",
    "figure [ fig : ts2 ] suggests that even if two of the three points ( the 11 - 16 pair and post-16 ) are in the mix of other frbs , one point ( the 7 - 11 pair ) lies in the far lower - left corner of the plot .",
    "since the total observation hours of other frbs have greatly exceeded 70 hours ( two of them , frb131104 and frb150807 , each have follow - up hours more than 70 hours ) , some repeating bursts should have been detected if all other frbs are similar to the repeater .",
    "the non - detection of any repeating bursts from any of those frbs therefore suggests that frb 121102 very likely is not representative of other frbs .",
    "using the published data , we compare the repeating frb 121102 and other frbs in the @xmath7 plane . we found that the repeater is well separated from other frbs in the plane .",
    "it has a much smaller duty cycle and a smaller flux ratio than other bursts .",
    "the conclusion remains valid if one chooses only bursts that are detectable with the parkes radio telescope .",
    "hundreds of hours of telescope time have been spent on the follow - up observations of several other frbs , yet none of them have been observed to repeat .",
    "the repeating frb 121102 is likely not representative of all frbs .",
    "since only the published data are used to perform this study , our conclusion is very conservative .",
    "many more bursts have been detected from the repeating frb 121102 ( l. spitler , 2017 , talk at aspen frb conference ) , and many more hours have been spent on other frbs without a detection of repeating frbs .",
    "this suggests that frb 121102 and other frbs should be even more separated in the @xmath7 plane , which further strengthens our conclusion .",
    "physically there could be two possibilities .",
    "first , maybe all frbs share a same progenitor system , but frb 121102 is unusually active in terms of producing repeating bursts . within the spindown and magnetic powered models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an active central engine should correspond to a relatively young age . according to this picture",
    ", other frbs should have older ages than the repeater .",
    "however , the essentially zero evolution of dm for the repeater @xcite places a lower limit on the age of the putative supernova remnant associated with the pulsar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is in apparent conflict with the suggested frb 110220/140514 association @xcite , which has a much more rapid dm evolution but less frequent bursts .",
    "possible solutions may invoke a mechanism not directly related to the spindown or the magnetic power of the central engine . in the cosmic comb model that invokes the kinetic energy of a nearby explosion or flare to power frbs @xcite ,",
    "the repeater is interpreted as a marginal combing system with the plasma - stream pressure not extremely higher than the magnetic pressure of the foreground neutron star , so that the magnetosphere can be repeatedly combed to produce repeating bursts .",
    "other frbs may correspond to more common cases that the stream ram pressure greatly exceeds magnetic pressure , so that repetition is not common .",
    "alternatively , in the gravitational - energy - powered scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the abnormally - high rate of repetition in the repeater may be related to special geometric configurations that allow more frequent triggers of the bursts .",
    "the second possibility is that the repeating frb 121102 has a distinct progenitor system than ( at least some of ) other frbs .",
    "one possibility is that ( at least some of ) other frbs are produced in catastrophic events so that they are intrinsically non - repeating frbs .",
    "blitzars @xcite and merger of compact stars @xcite remain attractive candidate progenitors for these non - repeating frbs ."
