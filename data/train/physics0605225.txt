    "it is now twenty years since ceperley and pollock ( cp ) carried out the first path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation of the superfluid transition of liquid 4.@xcite albeit restricted to a system of 64 4 atoms with periodic boundary conditions , that study demonstrated the feasibility of _ ab initio _ numerical studies of quantum many - body systems , the mass of the particles and the interaction potential being the sole input to the calculation .    the pimc method , in the form developed by cp ( henceforth referred to as  conventional \" ) , has since played a major role in the theoretical investigation of quantum many - body systems .",
    "not only has it provided quantitative results for a wide range of physical systems , it has also shaped , to some extent , our qualitative understanding of such phenomena as superfluidity ( sf ) and bose condensation , at the microscopic level .",
    "at least for bose systems , pimc is the _ only _ presently known method capable of furnishing in principle _ exact _ numerical estimates of physical observables at finite temperature ( @xmath3 ) , including the superfluid ( @xmath4 ) and condensate ( @xmath5 ) fractions . moreover , despite the notorious _ sign _ problem , that has so far made it impossible to obtain equally high quality results for fermi systems , pimc proves a valid option in this case as well , allowing one to obtain approximate estimates of accuracy at least comparable to that afforded by the other leading methods.@xcite    it thus seems reasonable to regard pimc as a realistic option to investigate ever more complex quantum many - body systems , and it makes sense to try and overcome its most important present limitations .",
    "aside from the above - mentioned _ sign _ problem , which we do _ not _ discuss in this paper , the main bottleneck of the current pimc technology is inarguably the maximum system size ( i.e. , number @xmath6 of particles ) for which accurate estimates can be obtained , in a reasonable amount of computer time .",
    "specifically , the computational effort required to study properties that most directly depend on particle indistinguishability , is observed to scale prohibitively with @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the superfluid fraction @xmath4 is obtained in a pimc simulation of bulk condensed matter , by means of the so - called winding number estimator,@xcite which can only take on a nonzero value if long permutation cycles of identical particles occur . in conventional pimc , the frequency with which such cycles are sampled , is an _ exponentially _ decreasing function of @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason , and in spite of ( at least ) a hundredfold increase in computer speed,@xcite since the pioneering work of ref .",
    "it has not proven possible to obtain estimates of the superfluid fraction in bulk liquid 4 for finite systems of more than @xmath6=64 particles .",
    "besides the unfavorable scaling of computing resources as a function of @xmath6 , another major issue that this entails is the difficulty of assessing reliably whether the observed absence of long permutation cycles reflects a genuine physical effect , or merely lack of ergodicity of the path sampling scheme.@xcite    how important is the above size limitation ?",
    "for most observables diagonal in the coordinate representation , one can often approach surprisingly closely the thermodynamic limit by simulating as few as @xmath7 30 particles , especially for systems characterized by short - ranged , lennard - jones - type interactions . on the other hand , an accurate _ quantitative _ characterization of the superfluid transition ( including the calculation of the transition temperature @xmath8 )",
    "can only be obtained via finite - size scaling analysis of results for @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 .",
    "the reliability of this procedure crucially hinges on the availability of data for large systems of significantly different sizes .",
    "attempts to estimate @xmath8 for superfluid 4 , based on pimc data for @xmath9 for systems of size @xmath6=64 and smaller , failed to yield quantitative results.@xcite    but there are other reasons , arguably more important than the mere pursuit of numerical accuracy , pointing to the importance and timeliness of extending by one or two orders of magnitude the size of the systems accessible to pimc . quite generally , in order for a scientific question to be meaningfully addressed by numerical simulations , the size of the simulated system should be greater than all characteristic length scales affecting the physics of interest .",
    "this is particularly important in the study of inhomogeneous phases of matter , or fluids in confinement , or restricted geometries .",
    "an example is provided by the study of helium fluid in porous glass , such as vycor ; the diameter of a characteristic pore is of the order of a few tens of  .",
    "thus , a realistic calculation , at the typical liquid helium density , requires that one be able to simulate a system comprising several thousands of atoms .",
    "other examples are the numerical investigations of multicomponent systems , as well as of grain boundaries , dislocations and other defects in quantum solids , or of incommensurate phases of films of helium or _",
    "para_-hydrogen adsorbed over substrates such as graphite .    over the past two decades",
    ", there has been relatively little experimentation with approaches to pimc simulations differing in some important aspects from the conventional one of cp , thoroughly described in ref . .",
    "as mentioned above , in conventional pimc the simulation of properties that are most directly affected by quantum statistics ( i.e. , by many - particle permutations ) , suffers from a very unfavorable scaling of required computer time with system size .",
    "this hurdle seems difficult to conquer within conventional pimc , and more generally within any monte carlo scheme formulated in the canonical ensemble , in which the winding number becomes `` topologically locked '' in the @xmath11 limit.@xcite    on the other hand , the same hurdle has been completely overcome in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of lattice models . a lattice path integral scheme based on an alternative sampling approach , known as _ worm algorithm _ ( wa ) ,",
    "@xcite has been demonstrated to allow for efficient calculations of winding numbers and of the one - particle green function @xmath12 , for systems of as many as @xmath7 10@xmath13 particles.@xcite it is particularly useful for the studies of critical phenomena since it does not suffer from the critical slowing down problem @xcite present in other local - update schemes .",
    "the wa has been recently extended to the study of systems in continuous space;@xcite it has first been shown to afford the simulation of the superfluid transition in liquid 4 in two dimensions , for systems comprising as many as 2500 particles , i.e. , about 100 times greater than those accessible to conventional pimc .",
    "subsequently , it has been applied to the study of bose condensation in crystalline 4,@xcite as well as to the investigation of superfluid properties of _",
    "para_-hydrogen droplets.@xcite    in all of these applications , the wa has provided accurate numerical results , simply not obtainable with any other existing method . it need be stressed , however , that the wa is not merely about doing large system sizes ( important as this is ) ; it is also the first _ grand canonical _ qmc method with local updates to incorporate in full quantum statistics .",
    "it affords the exact computation of imaginary - time off - diagonal correlations , such as the one - particle matsubara green function , that are not accessible to conventional pimc ( nor to any other qmc technique in continuous space ) .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed description of this new , powerful computational tool , which promises to open novel avenues to the theoretical exploration of strongly correlated many - body system .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section ( [ simplest ] ) , we describe the simplest implementation of the wa , also introducing our nomenclature , configurational space and data structure . in section [ mgf ] , we discuss in detail the computation of the matsubara green function , as well as of its equal - time limit , namely the one - particle density matrix . in section",
    "[ dia ] , we describe an important enhancement of the simple implementation , namely the expansion of ( the attractive part of ) the potential energy of interaction among particles in elementary ( diagrammatic ) contributions , that are then sampled by a monte carlo method .",
    "this scheme , which falls in the general category of diagrammatic monte carlo techniques,@xcite allows for the full inclusion of the contribution of the potential energy ( for an important class of potentials ) at a computational cost that is _ independent _ of the size of the system .    in sec .",
    "[ add ] , we provide some quantitative information related to the specific utilization of the wa in simulation studies of superfluid 4 . in sec .",
    "[ resu ] , we offer a quantitative demonstration of the power of the wa , by illustrating in detail our results for simulations of the superfluid transition of liquid 4 in two and three dimensions .",
    "we outline our conclusions , and discuss outlook for future applications of the wa , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we begin with some basic notation .",
    "we assume for definiteness a system of identical particles ( in @xmath14 dimensions ) obeying bose statistics.@xcite let @xmath15 be the mass of each particle .",
    "the system is enclosed in a cubic vessel of volume @xmath16 , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions ( other geometries , boundary conditions , and/or external forces require obvious and minimal modifications which are standard for any qmc scheme ) .",
    "we make from the outset the assumption of working in the _ grand canonical _ ensemble ; that is , the system is held in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at temperature @xmath17 ( we set @xmath18=1 ) , with which it can exchange particles as well .",
    "consequently , in order to specify the thermodynamic state of the system , we need to assign the chemical potential @xmath19 , which is an input parameter in our computational scheme , just like the temperature @xmath3 . the number of particles @xmath6 is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "let @xmath20 be the ( many - body ) system hamiltonian , which we assume of the following form : h = -_i=1^n_i^2 + _ i < j v(|*r*_i-*r*_j| ) , where @xmath21 and where @xmath22 is a pairwise interaction potential that depends only of the relative distance between any two particles.@xcite below , @xmath23 will always be used as a collective  coordinate \" , representing positions of all particles in the system , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "a fundamental aspect of the wa , which crucially distinguishes it from conventional pimc and from all existing qmc methods in the continuum , is that it operates in an extended configurational space , containing both closed world line configurations ( henceforth referred to as @xmath25- or diagonal configurations ) , as well as configurations containing one open world line ( worm ) .",
    "the @xmath25-configurations contribute to the partition function , whereas those with an open world line contribute to the one - particle matsubara green function ; in the following , the latter will be referred to as @xmath12- ( or , off - diagonal ) configurations .",
    "as we shall see , all topologically non - trivial modifications of world lines occur in the off - diagonal configurational space ( or , @xmath12-sector ) .",
    "the sampling process allows for transitions from the @xmath12- to the @xmath25-sector ( by closing , or removing the existing open world line ) and vice versa ( by creating a new open world line , or by opening an existing closed one ) .",
    "expectation values of all physical quantities of interest ( with the exception of the green function ) , including particle and winding numbers , are only updated when the random walk generates a diagonal configuration .",
    "next , we proceed to describe in detail the two sectors in which our configuration space is conceptually divided .      _",
    "the @xmath25-sector _ of our configuration space , is nothing but the full configuration space of conventional pimc .",
    "it naturally emerges from the path integral representation of the grand partition function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "each @xmath28_configuration _ is a discrete imaginary - time many - particle path , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 ( except for a possible permutation of particle labels ) , representing the integrand in the asymptotically exact ( in the @xmath31 limit ) integral decomposition of @xmath25 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 in turn , @xmath36 is a product of free - particle imaginary - time propagators , i.e. , with an obvious notation , _",

    "the function @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ zint ] ) incorporates correlations , both in space and in imaginary time , arising from interactions among particles .",
    "@xmath37 is chosen so that , in the @xmath38 limit , the distribution of discrete paths @xmath39 will asymptotically approach the correct continuous limit .",
    "several choices are possible @xcite for @xmath37 , but the simplest version of the algorithm described in this section does not depend on its particular form .",
    "in what follows , we refer to the product @xmath40 as a _",
    "configurational weight_.    eq .  ( [ start ] ) implies the following configuration space structure : one has @xmath6 single - particle paths ( world lines ) , labeled @xmath41 , propagating in the discretized imaginary time interval @xmath42 $ ] ( specifically , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) . each world line consists of @xmath45 successively linked  beads \" ( particle positions ) , labeled by the index of the corresponding imaginary time  slice \" , @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47-th bead of the @xmath48-th world line is positioned at @xmath49 .    as a result of @xmath50-periodicity , coupled with the physical indistinguishability of particles , the @xmath51-st bead of each world line",
    "must be linked to the zero - th bead of either the same , or another world line . for both theoretical and practical ( data structure ) purposes , it is advantageous to guarantee @xmath50-periodicity automatically ; to this aim , we regard world line configurations as closed loops on a @xmath52-dimensional surface of a @xmath53-dimensional @xmath50-cylinder , on which lie @xmath45 equidistant ( and equivalent ) imaginary time  hyperplanes \" ( corresponding to the different time slices ) , labelled @xmath54 .",
    "it should be noted that the total number of world line loops defined on the @xmath50-cylinder can be different from the total number of particles ; this is because a single world line which  winds around \" the imaginary time interval @xmath55 times before returning to its initial position represents not just one particle , but rather @xmath55 particles involved in the same exchange cycle .",
    "the presence of such exchange cycles is essential , in order to incorporate in the computational scheme the symmetry of the system with respect to particle permutations .      _",
    "the @xmath12-sector _ of our configurational space comes from the representation  analogous to that of the partition function , eq .",
    "( [ start])of the one - particle matsubara green function @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes thermal averaging , @xmath58 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are ( bose ) particle creation and annihilation operators in matsubara representation .",
    "the structure of the integral representation of @xmath61 is very similar to that of @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , the only qualitative difference of a @xmath12-sector (  off - diagonal \" ) configuration from a diagonal one , is that the former contains a _ worm _ , that is , a world line on a @xmath50-cylinder with two ends  the  head \" and the  tail \" corresponding to the green function annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "the two special beads at the open world line ends are named ( for historical reasons ) _ ira _ ( @xmath62 ) and _ masha _ ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "configurations in which @xmath62 and @xmath64 are located in space - time at points @xmath65 and @xmath66 contribute to @xmath67 with the weight defined in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) generalized to include the off - diagonal configuration sector .",
    "formally , the ensemble of wa configurations corresponds to the generalized partition function @xmath68 with @xmath69 the value of dimensionless parameter @xmath70 only affects the efficiency of the simulation , as @xmath70 controls the relative statistics of @xmath25- and @xmath12-sectors ; for the moment , we leave it undetermined , to come back to it later on , when discussing updates .",
    "an important new feature that arises when going from @xmath25 to @xmath71 , is that the number of continuous variables in @xmath12-sector configurations is not constant , but rather varies from configuration to configuration .",
    "this immediately points to diagrammatic monte carlo,@xcite as a general way to perform updates whenever the number of variables to sample , is itself variable .",
    "the sampling of paths @xmath72 , is implemented within the wa _ exclusively _ through a set of simple , _ local _ space - time updates involving @xmath62 ( or , @xmath64 ) .",
    "the particle number becomes configuration- and time - dependent ( there is one less particle between @xmath62 and @xmath64 , than in the rest of the path ) .",
    "this clearly shows how , by its very construction , the wa opens up the possibility of working in the _ grand canonical _ ensemble , with the chemical potential @xmath19 being an input parameter.@xcite obviously , wa updates can be combined with the conventional pimc updates to have the most flexible scheme .    in accordance with eq .",

    "in this section , we describe a set of ergodic local updates which sample the extended configuration space , switching between the @xmath25- and @xmath12-sectors . updates which change the number of continuous variables in @xmath39 , are arranged in complementary pairs , designed so as to satisfy the requirement of detailed balance .",
    "general principles of balancing complementary pairs can be found in ref .  .",
    "we have three pairs of updates altogether : _ open / close _ , _ insert / remove _ , and _ advance / recede_. only the _ swap _ update in the list below does not fall in this category , because it preserves the number of variables , i.e. , it is self - complementary .",
    "proposed updates are either accepted or rejected based on the metropolis algorithm , according to the standard procedure.@xcite    in order to keep the presentation simple , the sampling scheme described below is one in which every update can be proposed , regardless of its applicability to the current configuration ( for example , the proposal to _ remove _ the worm is allowed even if there is no worm in the current configuration , in which case the proposed update will necessarily be rejected ) .",
    "it should be understood , however , that standard sampling tricks can be used , whereby only applicable updates are proposed , thereby enhancing the performance.@xcite    to be specific , let us adopt the following data structure : all beads are labeled , and each bead is linked to its two world - line neighbors , the _ next _ and the _ previous _ beads on the @xmath50-cylinder , see fig .",
    "it proves convenient to introduce two functions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , mapping each bead onto its next and previous neighbor , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath84 means that the bead @xmath85 is the result of the @xmath15-fold application of @xmath82 to the bead @xmath86 ; likewise , @xmath87 .",

    "we did not use this efficiency enhancing modification of the conventional pimc configuration space , and still were able to perform accurate studies of several hundred atoms .",

    "we therefore refer the reader to ref . for a detailed discussion of these estimators . instead , we focus our discussion here on the estimator that is a characteristic feature of the wa , namely that of the matsubara green function .",
    "since the green function is sensitive only to relative distances in time , without loss of generality we can fix @xmath152 to simplify the notation . for an extra simplicity , we will also assume that at least one of the following two statements is true : ( i ) the problem is translationally invariant in the coordinate space .",

    "we conclude then that the diagrammatic expansion can be straightforwardly implemented for the high - accuracy scheme by omitting the @xmath285 term in the configuration weight .",

    "rather , the wa decisively overcomes the most important limitation of conventional pimc , namely the exponential inefficiency with which long permutation cycles are sampled , in the thermodynamic limit ( a limitation acknowledged by practitioners of pimc@xcite ) .",
    "we have also described a procedure , based on ideas of diagrammatic monte carlo , which allows one to enhance significantly the scalability of the computational scheme , without compromising on the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "the new methodology has already been applied to the study of the supersolid phase of helium,@xcite for which access to large system sizes is crucial ; it can also be expected to have broad impact on a wide variety of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems .",
    "it should be mentioned , that the efficiency with which long permutation cycles can be sampled using the wa , also significantly impacts the convergence of calculations of the superfluid properties of _ finite _ systems , such as quantum clusters.@xcite    there are other advantages to this new method , chiefly the fact that it is fully grand canonical , and that allows for the calculation of the matsubara green function , a quantity that can not e computed with any other existing qmc technique ( in continuous space ) .",
    "an immediate application of these last two aspects , is the calculation of chemical potentials and excitation gaps .",
    "consider , for instance , the calculation of the chemical potential at the liquid - solid transition line at low temperature , @xmath351 .",
    "the study of @xmath352 in the solid phase can be found in ref .  .",
    "the value of @xmath351 can be determined from the @xmath353 curve and known freezing density for the liquid which is at @xmath354 3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show data points for four values of the chemical potential and the position of the freezing density .",
    "all simulations were performed at @xmath355 k , and with the particle number @xmath356 .",
    "apart from average density we also calculated statistics of particle number fluctuations to obtain the compressibility of the system from @xmath357 .",
    "it provides an independent check for consistency and convergence of the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the slope of the solid line is obtained from the average value of @xmath358 for all data points shown . from this set of data",
    "we deduce that the critical value of the chemical potential as @xmath359 though one can deduce this parameter from the ground state energy as a function of particle number using @xmath360 , such simulations can not be performed for large system sizes with accuracy significantly better then few k.    the zero - momentum matsubara green function @xmath352 for the superfluid state at @xmath361 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . in the macroscopic limit",
    ", @xmath352 is @xmath362-independent , being equal to the total number of condensate particles .",
    "we show this plot to support our previous claim that in the superfluid state the two worm ends perform a random walk on large distances , and come close within the reach of the _ close _ and _ remove _ updates once per sweep .",
