    "an absorption heat pump is a multi - purpose thermal device in which the driving force is mostly heat , rather than mechanical work @xcite .",
    "the first design thereof was patented by ferdinand carr in 1860 and played a prominent role in the early development of refrigerators .",
    "anecdotally , in 1927 , albert einstein and le szilrd presented an absorption fridge running _ solely _ on heat , that operated at nearly constant pressure , requiring no moving parts @xcite . in spite of the obvious advantages of absorption technologies in terms of safety , reduced environmental impact or better exploitation of the freely available thermal resources ,",
    "mechanical compression cycles are preferred for most industrial and commercial applications , as these are usually much more efficient .",
    "consequently , considerable effort has been devoted over the last decades to improve the performance of absorption heat pumps @xcite in order to make them compete with their power - driven analogues .",
    "for instance , one could think of scaling up absorption systems into larger _",
    "multi - stage _ configurations capable of reusing the residual output heat for further cooling , thus boosting their overall performance @xcite .",
    "it was already acknowledged in the late 1950s that a three level _ maser _ selectively coupled to two heat baths and a coherent driving field , is a valid embodiment for a quantum heat engine @xcite , which running in reverse ultimately amounts to a power - driven fridge .",
    "ever since , quantum heat engines and refrigerators have been object of extensive study @xcite , including detailed experimental proposals @xcite , and the development of strategies to overcome their ultimate thermodynamics limitations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a three - level maser operating between heat baths only ( i.e. without driving ) realizes a _ quantum _ absorption heat pump @xcite , that can function either as a fridge or as a ` heat transformer ' . in particular , quantum absorption fridges have attracted a lot of attention @xcite , mostly because of their inherent simplicity , that allows to gain insight into the emergence of the laws of thermodynamics from individual open quantum systems @xcite .    in many practical situations , absorption chillers might also be a preferable alternative to power - driven quantum devices .",
    "nonetheless , as in the classical case , these are usually much less efficient and powerful than the best reversed heat engines @xcite , which turns the optimization of their performance into a matter of paramount importance .",
    "some steps have been already undertaken in this direction , by identifying the upper bounds on a suitable figure of merit for the cooling performance , and the design prescriptions for their saturation @xcite , and by proposing reservoir engineering techniques @xcite in order to _ push _ those bounds further @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the important differences between classical and quantum absorption heat pumps , it is most natural to ask whether significant enhancement can be expected from scaling up quantum thermodynamic cycles into `` larger '' multi - stage networks . in order to quantitatively",
    "assess the size scaling on the performance of heat pumps , we constructively build generalized @xmath0-level ideal absorption devices by coupling together @xmath1 elementary three - level cycles , somewhat in the spirit of _ parallel _ multi - stage classical absorption devices @xcite .",
    "we then compute the efficiency at maximum cooling power and the maximum power itself as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath2 .",
    "while the efficiency proves to be roughly size - independent , the corresponding power only increases mildly with the number of stages , quickly saturating to a constant asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , and again in total correspondence with the classical scenario , double - stage absorption heat pumps appear as the most reasonable compromise between simplicity and performance .",
    "interestingly , this case of @xmath3 happens to correspond with the two - qubit model recently introduced in @xcite , thus marking it as a target for experimental implementations .",
    "we also carry out an extensive numerical investigation that supports the general validity and tightness of the model - independent performance bound established in @xcite , for all ideal multi - stage absorption refrigerators .",
    "finally , we compare the non - ideal eight - level absorption fridge of @xcite with all its ideal counterparts , when operating under the same conditions .",
    "we find that ideal fridges largely outperform non - ideal ones , not only when it comes to their maximum achievable efficiency but , especially , in terms of their maximum cooling power .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we start by providing a brief review of quantum absorption heat pumps in sec .  [ review ] . in sec .",
    "[ system ] , we introduce our constructive scheme to build generalized multi - stage parallel cycles , discuss their microscopic model and corresponding master equation , and obtain the steady - state heat currents flowing across the system .",
    "we shall be then , in sec .",
    "[ results ] , in the position to quantitatively compare the maximum cooling power and the corresponding efficiency of devices with increasing @xmath0 and fixed input thermal resources . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a three - level system with hamiltonian @xmath4 in its energy eigenbasis @xmath5 .",
    "we shall allow for a _ very weak _ dissipative interaction between the transition @xmath6 and a ` cold ' heat bath at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , we couple the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 very weakly to a high temperature ` work ' reservoir and a ` hot ' bath respectively , such that @xmath10 .",
    "once its asymptotic state builds up , this system operates as the most fundamental quantum absorption heat pump @xcite , relying on the imbalance between the steady - state rates associated with the cooling cycle @xmath11 , and its complement , the heat - transforming cycle @xmath12 .",
    "when the asymptotic rate of the cooling cycle exceeds that of the heat - transforming cycle , net ` heat ' per unit time is extracted from the cold and work reservoirs and dumped into the hot bath . that is , net energy is moved between the hot and cold baths _ against _ the temperature gradient , with the assistance of the input heat coming from the work bath .",
    "depending on the whether the useful effect is sought in the cold or the hot bath , we speak of a quantum absorption chiller or a quantum absorption heater .",
    "if on the contrary , the stationary rate of the heat - transforming cycle exceeds that of the cooling cycle , low - quality heat coming from the hot bath would be upgraded to high - temperature heat leaking into the work bath , only by means of the coupling to the cold bath .",
    "these are the two modes of operation of both classical and quantum absorption heat pumps @xcite .    at the steady state and given that each reservoir interacts _ locally _ with its corresponding transition @xcite , it is intuitively clear that all three heat currents ( work , hot and cold ) must flow at the same rate , in order to keep the average energy asymptotically stationary @xcite , i.e. one must have : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for the steady - state heat current flowing _ from _ bath @xmath15 _ into _ the system .",
    "therefore @xmath16 note that the frequency of the work transition @xmath8 is just @xmath17 .",
    "we will take eq .   as the defining property of an _ ideal _ heat pump .",
    "more generally , the asymptotic _ stationarity _ of energy , translates into @xmath18 which holds for both ideal and non - ideal devices . since there is no work involved in the operation of the pump , eq .",
    "is just a statement of the first law of thermodynamics . on another note , and always provided that the dissipation is _ sufficiently weak _ , the positivity of the rate of irreversible entropy production @xcite makes it possible to write down the second law of thermodynamics in the form @xcite @xmath19 eqs .   and encode most of the relevant information about absorption heat pumps .",
    "let us take for instance , an ideal device , assuming that it works in the chiller / heater mode , so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 . then , combining eqs .",
    "and one arrives to @xmath22 which defines the _ cooling window _ , that is , the region in parameter space in which cooling ( and heating ) is permitted by the second law . for @xmath23 , it is the heat - transforming cycle the one that dominates , thus rendering a quantum absorption heat transformer .    from the cooling point of view , the ratio of the incoming cold heat @xmath24 and the energetic cost @xmath25 of its processing , defines the efficiency or coefficient of performance ( cop ) @xmath26 , which benchmarks the useful effect of an absorption chiller . combining eqs .   and",
    ", one generally finds @xmath27 that is , that the maximum efficiency allowed is the corresponding carnot cop @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the carnot efficiency is indeed saturated by an ideal fridge at @xmath29 , where each transition equilibrates with its local bath and consequently , all heat currents vanish @xcite . in general , for a _ non - ideal _ absorption chiller [ i.e. a system not obeying eq .",
    "] , eq .   would be a strict inequality @xcite , while eq .   would cease to hold .",
    "an autonomous thermal device based on two non - interacting qubits was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , which ultimately amounts to two elementary three - level cycles _ sharing _ the work transition .",
    "it can be seen that it realizes a parallel double - stage ideal heat pump and that the partial heat currents from each stage just add up to the total @xcite .",
    "the overlap between them , however , makes their individual contributions smaller than what would be expectable from two independent three - level heat pumps .",
    "once more , the correspondence between the classical and the quantum case is apparent @xcite , and the question naturally arises about the size scaling of the cooling power @xmath24 and the cop @xmath30 of multi - stage quantum absorption refrigerators . does the size really matter in quantum absorption cooling ?      a generalized @xmath0-level ideal heat pump may be built by merging @xmath1 three - level systems , alternatively sharing a work or a cold transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the case @xmath31 ( triple - stage ) is schematically illustrated ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian of such @xmath0-level system reads @xmath32{\\left\\vert2n\\right\\rangle}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\lceil",
    "n/2 \\rceil-1 } n~\\omega_h{\\left\\vert2n+1\\right\\rangle } , \\label{hamiltoniann}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the floor and ceiling functions .",
    "let us model the system - baths interactions with a term of the form @xmath35 , where    @xmath36    [ sigma ]    the reservoirs may consist , as usual , of an infinite collection of uncoupled harmonic modes in three dimensions .",
    "we choose the bath coupling operators @xmath37 to be @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we denote the annihilation and creation operators for mode @xmath41 in the reservoir @xmath42 , and define the coupling constants as @xmath43 , which yields flat spectral densities ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the dissipation strengths @xmath45 are chosen so as to define the largest dynamical time - scale in the problem @xmath46 this allows us to perform the born - markov and secular approximations in deriving a master equation for the system @xcite . under the further assumption of a preparation with totally uncorrelated system and equilibrium reservoirs ,",
    "one readily obtains @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the state of the system in the interaction picture and the _ dissipators _ @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 here , the positive _ decay rates _",
    "@xmath51 are the diagonal elements of the spectral correlation tensor @xcite , which for a three - dimensional free bosonic field in thermal equilibrium are given by @xmath52>0 $ ] , with @xmath53 .",
    "the mutually adjoint _ jump _ operators @xmath54 are just    @xmath55    the dissipators in eq .",
    "are in the standard lindblad form @xcite , which guarantees that the reduced dynamics of the system is completely positive and trace - preserving .",
    "each of them individually , generates a fully contractive dynamics of the system towards its ` local ' equilibrium states @xmath56 @xcite , which in turn , implies the second law of thermodynamics as expressed by eq .",
    "@xcite .      in the light of eqs .   and , our definition of steady - state heat current from sec .",
    "[ review ] translates into @xmath57 @xcite , where the asymptotic state @xmath58 results from equating to zero the right - hand side of eq .",
    ".    in the simplest case of @xmath59 , one easily finds    @xmath60    [ heat_currents_3 ]    the addition of a second stage to the heat pump introduces the further cold and hot transitions @xmath61 and @xmath62 that contribute to the total steady - state heat currents to yield    @xmath63    [ heat_currents_3 ]    in general , for arbitrary @xmath0 , one would be left with    @xmath64    [ heat_currents_n ]    which provides , together with eqs .   and , closed formulas for the evaluation of the stationary heat currents . from now on ,",
    "we shall focus on the chiller operation mode . at first glance",
    ", one could intuitively expect a different scaling of e.g. @xmath65 for even and odd @xmath0 : the addition of an even level to the heat pump provides it with an extra cold transition , so that a new term contributes to the cold current in eq .   while , when the added level is odd , the new contribution appears instead in the work current of eq .  .",
    "it must be noted , however , that each of the already contributing terms will always decrease as @xmath0 grows , e.g. @xmath66 when going from eq .   to eq .  .",
    "it can be seen by numerical inspection of eqs .   that increasing the number of stages from even to odd is indeed detrimental for _ all _ currents , i.e. @xmath67 , when @xmath0 is even . still for arbitrary @xmath0",
    ", one always finds @xmath68 , though the enhancement decreases as the system scales up .    for practical purposes , one would wish to optimize the incoming cold heat current to cool as _ quickly _ as possible . given a set of heat baths @xmath69 and dissipation rates @xmath45 , one has to find the cold frequency @xmath70 that renders the maximum cooling power @xmath71 for every fixed @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding cop @xmath73 is a sensible figure of merit for cooling and , as rigorously proven in @xcite , it is tightly upper bounded by @xmath74 both in the single and double - stage cases , where @xmath75 stands for the _ spatial _ dimensionality of the cold bath , i.e. in our case @xmath76 .",
    "once parameter optimization has taken place at the single - stage level , we shall be concerned with the potential enhancement in both @xmath73 and @xmath71 as the number of stages , and thus the system s complexity , grows .",
    "the dependence of the maximum cooling power on the number of stages is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "the temperatures @xmath69 , dissipation rates @xmath45 and the hot frequency @xmath72 were chosen at random so as to fix the time scales for thermal fluctuations , dissipation and system s free evolution .",
    "then , the optimization in @xmath77 was carried out within the cooling window .",
    "as could be expected from the even / odd oscillations of the stationary heat currents , @xmath78 scales differently for even and odd @xmath0 .",
    "while in the even case , the cooling power barely increases , odd heat pumps significantly benefit from scaling up .",
    "one also sees that any even configuration outperforms all the odd ones .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding cop at maximum power @xmath73 proves to be roughly size - independent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] .",
    "consequently , the double - stage absorption heat pump @xcite tuned to operate at maximum power , appears as the best possible choice in terms of system optimization .",
    "our extensive numerics show that these properties are completely general in the range of application of eqs .   and .",
    "it is always possible to enhance both the cooling power and the corresponding cop , by suitably engineering the spectrum of the environments @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest thing to try is squeezing the modes of the work bath , which effectively raises its temperature @xmath79 and boosts the output power of the heat pump @xcite .",
    "the carnot bound @xmath28 is also effectively increased , which allows for larger efficiencies at maximum power .",
    "the effect of reservoir squeezing in the cooling power is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] for a squeezing of @xmath80 db or @xmath81 ( see figure caption for details ) . as @xmath79 increases ,",
    "the corresponding contact transitions tend to saturate . in the limit of @xmath82 ,",
    "one realizes generalized multi - stage carnot engines running in reverse @xcite and thus , abandons the realm of absorption chillers .",
    "the limiting cooling powers are also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "the quest for tight bounds to the cop at maximum power for heat engines and refrigerators has attracted a lot of interest over the last decades , both in the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite scenarios . by making minimal assumptions about the dominating sources of irreversibility ,",
    "the aim is to derive practical bounds , as widely applicable as possible , to benchmark the operation of realistic devices .",
    "the paradigmatic example is the curzon - ahlborn bound @xcite : although obtained for a specific phenomenological modeling of the sources of irreversibility , i.e. the _ endoreversible _ approximation , it emerges naturally as a limiting case in different instances of heat engine @xcite and describes well the performance of actual power plants .",
    "the bound @xmath83 , derived from first principles for the three - level maser and the four - level double stage chiller in @xcite , has been also seen to hold @xcite in the non - ideal eight - level refrigerator model of @xcite , and even succeeds in limiting from above the performance of classical endoreversible absorption fridges @xcite . in order to establish whether it continues to hold for multi - stage ideal absorption refrigerators beyond the cases @xmath59 and @xmath3 , we performed global numerical optimization of @xmath73 over @xmath72 , @xmath69 , @xmath45 and @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "an histogram on the resulting cop at maximum power for @xmath85 randomly drawn refrigerators is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , clearly showing that the bound holds _ tightly _ regardless of the size of the system .",
    "a lot of interest has been generated by the non - ideal eight - level ( three - qubit ) absorption fridge , first introduced in @xcite , including experimental proposals for its implementation on super - conducting qubits @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it is legitimate to ask how does it compare , in terms of absolute cooling power , with its ideal eight - level counterpart .",
    "interestingly , all ideal multi - stage fridges ( even the three - level maser ) , can be seen to largely outperform the eight level non - ideal chiller , typically by several orders of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] this is illustrated by plotting together the performance characteristics of both the non - ideal three - qubit and the ideal ` sextuple - stage ' ( @xmath86 ) chiller , for the same choice of parameters . a closed curve in the @xmath24 ",
    "@xmath30 plane is indicative of irreversibility and prevents the refrigerator from ever realizing the carnot efficiency .",
    "the cop at maximum power is roughly the same in both cases ( close to its ultimate @xmath87 bound ) , but the power @xmath71 of the ideal fridge exceeds that of the non - ideal one by over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that any realistic application of absorption technologies to quantum cooling , should rely upon physical implementations of ideal ( multi - stage ) heat pumps , out of which the double - stage design @xcite stands out with its optimal balance between performance and simplicity .",
    "we have studied the size scaling of the power and the efficiency of parallel multi - stage quantum absorption heat pumps .",
    "when working in the chiller configuration , heat pumps comprised of an odd and even number stages , scale differently in terms of their maximum achievable cooling power : devices with even @xmath0 always provide a larger power , which is almost size - independent , while in heat pumps with odd @xmath0 , the maximum power increases with the number of stages , quickly saturating to a constant asymptotic value .",
    "contrarily , the efficiency at maximum power does not significantly scale with @xmath0 and , upon global optimization over all free parameters , it saturates to the same model - independent bound , regardless of the size of the system .    even if the heat currents were formally given in eqs .   and",
    ", the explicit formulas for any @xmath0 are quite involved and nothing but insightful .",
    "the whole analysis is therefore based on extensive numerics .",
    "it must be acknowledged as well , that the working substance of an ideal multi - stage absorption refrigerator is generally a rather artificial quantum system .",
    "interestingly enough , the case of @xmath3 , that appears as the optimal compromise between performance and complexity , also turns out to correspond to the two - qubit model of @xcite .",
    "this suggests that it should be considered for practical applications of absorption cooling to quantum technologies .    the double - stage fridge ( more generally , _ any _ ideal heat pump ) was seen to outperform by several orders of magnitude the maximum cooling power delivered by the only available ( non - ideal ) alternative model : the three - qubit refrigerator @xcite",
    ". arrangements of superconducting qubits @xcite or coupled quantum dots @xcite , similar to those proposed to realize the three - qubit device , could also be good candidates to support the more promising double - stage absorption chillers",
    ".    further enhancement of both the power and the efficiency can always be achieved by applying quantum reservoir engineering techniques @xcite meant to render exploitable nonequilibrium environmental fluctuations , thus raising absorption technologies to the level of the best compression - based quantum thermodynamic cycles .",
