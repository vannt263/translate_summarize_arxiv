    "early  type galaxies ( the family consisting of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , hereafter e+s0 galaxies ) represent one of the most important diagnostics within the cosmological picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "the simplified baryonic recipes are interpreted and implemented differently in the simulations @xcite . in this paradigm , field",
    "early  type galaxies are assembled through merging and accretion events of smaller clumps and fragments on longer time  scales up to the recent past @xcite .",
    "the environment is therefore suggested to play an important role to constrain the formation and evolution of e+s0 galaxies and their internal properties .",
    "these predictions have significant imprints for the abundance and mass distribution of an existing or even fully established population of old massive systems at @xmath9 @xcite and also for recent claims of the detection of their possible progenitors at high redshifts of @xmath10 @xcite .    over the past few years",
    "theoretical semi - analytic models of galaxy formation have been improved dramatically . by including a secondary star burst mode to the previous quiescent star formation history , i.e. allowing a fraction of gas to be directly transformed into stars in merging galaxies @xcite , an increasing amount of supernova feedback and/or an additional effect of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback @xcite or virial shocks of infalling gas in a spherical halo @xcite to suppress the remaining star formation activity ,",
    "a much better agreement with the observations has been achieved .",
    "the suppression of star formation in massive halos using primarily agn feedback has a strong impact at the top of the luminosity function ( lf ) that results in a far less overproduction of massive galaxies at @xmath8 than earlier simulations , while still providing a good description of the rest of the observed lf up to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a non - negligible excess of local luminous galaxies detectable in the local simulated lf , which models adjust by including additional internal dust obscuration or a relative inefficiency of the stellar mass of merging galaxies that results in a population of free - floating intergalactic stars @xcite .",

    "however , the cosmic formation epoch and evolutionary history of isolated field galaxies remains unclear .",
    "indeed , galaxy formation models based on a hierarchical structure growth envision for a given galaxy mass a dependence on environment @xcite . at a given redshift this environmental effect results in explicit age variations between e+s0 galaxies in clusters and in low  density regions , where cluster ellipticals show an average luminosity  weighted age of 9.6  gyr , whereas field e+s0s being by @xmath184  gyr younger and displaying a broader age spread than their counterparts in clusters @xcite .",

    "so far , for the field galaxy population inconsistent results have been derived .",
    "some studies suggest an evolution similar to early  type galaxies in clusters @xcite , but others prefer a faster mass assembly over a shorter time period since @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a comprehensive investigation of early - type field galaxies within the goods - n field and detected evidence for a mass dependent evolution .",
    "similar results were derived by @xcite and @xcite from an analysis of field e+s0 galaxies in the cdfs . however , although these samples were drawn from the same field they rather found incomparable galaxy sizes and velocity dispersions for individual objects ( see   [ sec : litcmp ] for more details ) . moreover",
    ", the different target selection procedures among the studies ( e.g. , magnitude , colour , morphology ) might induce some inconsistency in the final sample , for example selecting galaxies with the reddest colours would favour the more massive systems where variations are less pronounced or using low signal - to - noise ( @xmath22 ) spectra limits the detection post - starburst galaxies or the contamination by bulge - dominated spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , difficulties may arise from the small number statistics of some works and the impact of cosmic variance remains yet to be unknown and hard to distinguish from the used sample selection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "star formation in stellar systems is suppressed and the majority of galaxies have already been transformed into passive , quiescent galaxies .",
    "the global trend of a downward evolution of the transitional mass with increasing age of the universe , where @xmath379 decreases by a factor of @xmath185 from @xmath380 , is well reproduced by measurements based on the combo-17 and deep2 redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "this transitional ( crossover ) mass is computed in different redshift bins for 50% late - type ( spirals and peculiars ) morphologies ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : mbz ] ) , 50% galaxies with blue @xmath381 colour ( dot - dashed line ) , and 50% galaxies with -inferred sfrs above 0.2@xmath310 ( dotted line ) .",
    "these trends can also be fairly well described by the solid line in figure  [ fig : mbz ] , which indicates the average evolution of the passively evolved lf for early - type galaxies from the combo-17 , deep2 and sxds with redshift @xcite at which the bulk ( @xmath4560% ) of the e+s0 galaxies are already in place .",
    "while our observed field galaxies are in good agreement with the model predictions using blue @xmath381 color criterion , in particular for fainter ( hence lower mass ) individual field galaxies ( @xmath382 , @xmath285 ) , models with high sfr ( as measured from the  emission strength ) are not consistent with the observations .",
    "there is a weak increase of the quenching mass @xmath379 with redshift which is already apparent at lower redshifts @xmath245 , which continuous up to higher redshifts @xmath383 .",
    "this trend suggests that star formation is more effectively suppressed in more luminous ( massive ) systems .",
    "strong suppression of star formation could be triggered from agn feedback of weak low luminosity ( radio - mode ) agn that have red optical colours and are situated in very massive dark matter haloes @xcite .    ]",
    "figure  [ fig : mbz ] suggests further that the evolution is a strong function of luminosity and mass and the evolution depends on the ( evolution corrected ) luminosity and stellar mass range of each specific galaxy sample under consideration .",
    "evidence for this trend is also accumulated by studies of the redshift evolution of the lf , which argue that the number density of massive e+s0 galaxies ( @xmath287 ) remains constant out to @xmath6 @xcite . for less massive galaxies ( @xmath285 ) , the lf becomes progressively underpopulated with increasing redshift , which could point to the fact that the progenitors of the massive local e+s0 galaxies are still experiencing a period of active star formation .",
    "these galaxies would be too blue to fulfill the requirements in the lf selection at higher redshift , and could gradually build up the red sequence of massive e+s0 galaxies by a successive quenching of the star formation at the less massive end of the lf ( @xmath285 ) . in this picture , a fraction of blue ( spiral ) galaxies experience a rather slow , gradual morphological transformation into red , ` dead ' quiescent e+s0 galaxies by a progressive quenching of star formation since redshifts @xmath384 .",
    "using a combination of high signal - to - noise intermediate - resolution vlt spectroscopy , deep @xmath32 ground  based photometry , and high - resolution acs imaging , we have investigated the properties and evolution of 24 field early - type ( e+s0 ) galaxies covering redshifts @xmath0 down to a magnitude limit of @xmath1 .",
    "the targets were selected from the southern fdf and northern whdf based on morphology , luminosity , spectrophotometric type , and photometric redshift or broad - band colours . scaling relationships of the faber - jackson relation ( fjr ) , and kormendy relation as well as the fundamental plane ( fp )",
    "have been constructed to assess the evolution of the stellar populations for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the formation epoch for the bulk of the stars in these systems was constrained by comparing the evolution of the @xmath5 ratios to different stellar population models .",
    "to reveal the origin of the star formation in some of our galaxies , we have exploited the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data archives .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows :    * the mass - to - light ratio of the field early - type galaxies evolves on average as @xmath274 , which is faster than for cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with field e+s0 galaxies comprising on average younger stellar populations than those of their cluster counterparts .",
    "* the evolution as derived from the scaling relations of the fjr , the fp and hence the effective mass - to - light ratio shows a strong dependence on the mass .",
    "less - massive systems with @xmath263 display a faster @xmath5 evolution of @xmath385 , whereas more - massive galaxies with @xmath386 evolve much slower as @xmath387 .",
    "this implies that for the most massive field galaxies ( @xmath386 ) the majority of their stellar populations have been formed early at @xmath388 . for less - massive galaxies the evolution in the @xmath5 ratios",
    "can be translated into a lower formation redshift of their stars of @xmath389 , which is at variance with the predictions of single - burst stellar population models .",
    "a fraction of 5%10% in the total stellar mass of lower - mass galaxies ( @xmath263 ) must have been formed at more recent epochs . at @xmath194 , an accelerated evolution for less - massive galaxies ( @xmath390 ) than for more - massive ones ( @xmath269 )",
    "is significant on the 2@xmath13 level . *",
    "the morphological sub - classes of early - type galaxies , elliptical and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies , appear not to represent a homogenous group but follow different evolutionary tracks .",
    "lenticular galaxies feature on average a stronger luminosity evolution ( @xmath391 ) , bluer rest - frame colours and more diverse stellar populations and hence evolve faster than elliptical galaxies ( @xmath392 ) . however , the differences between elliptical and lenticular galaxies are only moderate significant and difficult to disentangle from their individual scatter .",
    "note that for deriving the scatter we took into account random errors as well as systematic uncertainties ( see   [ eso ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the scatter appears to be mainly amplified for lenticular galaxies . *",
    "evidence for secondary star formation activity in some of our galaxies is provided by the detection of  emission or strong  balmer absorption as well as bluer rest - frame @xmath102 colour diagnostics .",
    "the  absorption line strengths in our galaxies implies that the residual ( low level ) star formation of the galaxies accounts for 5% to 10% in the total stellar mass budget of these systems .",
    "* we have found three possible candidates that could harbour an central agn source .",
    "however , the trigger of the star formation in our galaxies is most likely either stellar origin or the result of agn feedback from weak low luminosity ( radio - mode ) agn with red optical colours @xcite . * over the past @xmath186  gyr , there is the trend of a slow decreasing quenching mass , which characterises a crossover in stellar mass above star formation in galaxies gets suppressed .",
    "this suggest that our systems experience a gradual suppression in their star formation processes .",
    "our results favour a scenario where star formation is not immediately suppressed for less - massive halos and hence works on longer time scales in lower - mass galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath5 ratio of our field early - type galaxies favours a downsizing formation scenario , similar to the detected decrease in luminosity of rapidly star forming field galaxies since @xmath3931 @xcite . in this ` top - down ' picture , massive galaxies are dominated by quiescent ( red , old ) stellar populations and evolve passively on longer timescales .",
    "less - massive systems , however , exhibit more extended star formation histories with mass hosting star formation processes decreasing as times evolves .",
    "both , the mass assembly and star formation are accelerated in massive stellar systems that are preferably located in high density environments .",
    "in contrast , in less - massive ( smaller ) systems , these physical processes work on longer timescales . moreover , our results suggest a continuous mass assembly of field early - type galaxies during the last 5 gyr .",
    "this is supported by recent studies of field galaxies up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "an accelerated evolution in the @xmath5 ratios of the less - massive galaxies with respect to more - massive ones was also found for _ cluster _ early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the lack of a significant age difference between field and cluster early - type galaxies as expected from hierarchical formation models @xcite , and the dependence of the evolution on galaxy mass suggests that environmental effects play a rather minor role in the formation of early - type galaxies .",
    "more important to the evolutionary history of a stellar system are its internal properties , such as chemical composition or element abundance ratios .    in a next step",
    ", we will combine our precise fp measurements with an analysis of the absorption line strengths in our field early - type galaxies .",
    "this will provide strong constraints on the evolution of stellar populations and the chemical enrichment history of heavy elements in these systems .",

    "one galaxy with four repeat observations is denoted with two additional large circles . in general ,",
    "velocity dispersions of the secondary measurements are based on lower @xmath22 spectra and therefore show larger errors . the final measurement with the smallest error yielded @xmath398  km  s@xmath14   ( @xmath399 ) , which represents also the smaller deviation with respect to the reference line .",
    "for the whdf field ellipticals the relative difference between reference and secondary measurements is @xmath400 with @xmath401 . in order to increase the signal  to  noise in the final spectra ,",
    "these repeat observations have been co  added .",
    "the repeated @xmath13 measurements in different slitlet configurations prove that our kinematic measurements are very stable and that internal effects such as varying spectral wavelength range and slitlet position on the fors spectrograph can be neglected .",
    "early - type galaxies in the nearby universe with luminosities typically @xmath402ergss@xmath14 most likely harbour an agn source in their centre @xcite . below this flux limit at @xmath403ergss@xmath14 ,",
    "the main contributions to the total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy could be a variety of sources , such as from low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) , high - mass and low - mass x - ray ( stellar ) binaries ( lmxbs ) and emission fluxes from the diffuse soft x - ray plasma that surrounds the galaxy ( @xmath404kev ) .",
    "lmxbs are associated with evolved old stellar populations ( a stars ) and a common feature in local bulge systems in the field and globular clusters . as both e and s0 galaxies comprise homogenous stellar populations , their x - ray binaries ( xrb ) populations",
    "should also be uniformly distributed among the galaxy populations . in the past",
    "it was proposed that lmxbs might even dominate the global x - ray emission of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , this issue is hard to quantify as lmxbs can not be identified as individual point sources . on the other hand for fainter x - ray systems observations",
    "argue that lmxbs account for a significant high fraction ( from 20% up to 50% ) of the x - ray emission of the host galaxy @xcite , which becomes a non - negligible factor when estimating the dynamical masses of their stellar host systems .    in oder to identify in our sample of galaxies with possible associated x - ray counterparts ( see   [ xray ] ) those systems with nuclear activity or ongoing star formation , an effective way would be to classify our galaxies schematically based on their measured x - ray luminosity . using the x - ray flux measurements for our objects",
    ", we can give constraints on the various sources that contribute to the x - ray emission of our galaxies .",
    "the two main groups of interests are systems with nuclear activity based on the x - ray luminosity ( xagn ) and galaxies with low - luminosity nuclear activity ( llagn ) and/or ongoing star formation .    for the old quiescent stellar populations in early - type galaxies , pointlike x - ray sources",
    "are very likely to be entirely resembled by lmxbs .",
    "the contribution due to lmxbs is direct proportional to the stellar mass of a galaxy . in general , these binary systems ( @xmath405 sources per galaxy ) account for a smaller but non - negligible fraction ( @xmath29625% ) of the total galaxy x - ray luminosity @xcite . using the relationship between total @xmath2-band and x - ray luminosity by @xcite as @xmath369(lmxb)=@xmath406 ( in units of ergss@xmath14 )",
    ", we measure an average contribution of lmxbs of @xmath36217%@xmath1157% .",
    "the evolution corrected absolute @xmath2-band luminosities of our galaxies fall in the range @xmath407 with a median of 10.47 . as a comparison , introducing our @xmath3-band measurements of @xmath408 ( average 11.22 ) and a similar relation as above but for the @xmath3-band luminosity of @xmath369(lmxb)=@xmath409 ( ergss@xmath14 ) , we detect an lmxb source contribution of @xmath36218%@xmath1156% .",
    "local early - type galaxies show a correlation of their soft x - ray luminosity with their stellar @xmath410 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "excluding dwarf galaxies , brightest cluster / group galaxies and galaxies with agn hosts , @xcite found for 184 nearby e+s0 galaxies log(@xmath369)=@xmath411log@xmath412 . because of the evolved stellar populations in the local e+s0 galaxies , any detected excess with respect to this empirical relation",
    "would imply a measure of star formation processes or llagns in our distant galaxies . applying the above relationship to our sample ,",
    "we derive an excess in diffuse plasma fraction of @xmath36226%@xmath11515% compared to the local value . using instead the relation by @xcite @xmath413 , the fraction of soft x - ray plasma decreases to @xmath3627%@xmath1153% .",
    "both measurements give evidence for a weak excess in the x - ray luminosities in our distant galaxies ( @xmath414 ) compared to the local reference .",
    "the increased luminosities are most likely the result of a combination of star formation and/or llagn .",
    "however , a possible contribution from lmxbs and soft diffuse x - ray plasma emission to the x - ray luminosities can not be ruled out completely .",
    "to clearly distinguish between the various contributions a detailed analysis of the x - ray spectra is necessary which goes beyond the scope of the present work ."
