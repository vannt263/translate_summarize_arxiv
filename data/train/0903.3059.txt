    "the state of knowledge on planetary systems has undergone a major revolution over the past 14 years .",
    "starting with the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a normal , hydrogen - burning star in 1995 @xcite , the sample of known exoplanets has rapidly expanded from a sample of one to 320 individual planets residing in 276 planetary systems .",
    "the majority of these planets were detected by either doppler techniques or by photometric transit surveys , and therefore have well - characterized orbits with system parameters amenable to uniform statistical analyses @xcite .",
    "additional planets have been discovered using gravitational microlensing and a handful of planets have even been directly imaged @xcite .",
    "the occurrence rates , orbital properties , and physical characteristics of these worlds inform our understanding of the formation and orbital evolution of planets in general , and the origin of our solar system in particular .",
    "the search for exoplanets began with a humble and ancient question : do planets exist around other stars .",
    "hints initially emerged with the detection of kuiper belt - like dust disks around young stars such as vega and @xmath0 pic @xcite , the radial velocity ( rv ) detection of progressively smaller substellar companions @xcite , and the discovery of `` pulsar planets '' @xcite .",
    "since then , the study of planet occurrence has evolved from a question of existence to a full - fledged statistical study of hundreds of systems . where planets are found and their relative frequencies around stars of various types provide valuable insights into the planet formation process and guide future planet search efforts .",
    "doppler surveys of thousands of stars have shown that among the sun - like , fgk stars in the solar neighborhood , roughly one in ten harbors an giant planet with a period @xmath1  days and a minimum mass greater than half the mass of jupiter (  @xmath2  ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of detectable planets as a function of semimajor axis , @xmath3 , is roughly flat out to 1  au , and then rises toward @xmath4  au , a cutoff corresponding the decade - long time baselines of the doppler - based planet searches ( figure [ plotocc ] ) .",
    "careful extrapolation to larger semimajor axes indicates that 17 - 19% of stars harbor a giant planet within 20  au @xcite , and the planets discovered by direct imaging suggest that planets exist out to semimajor axes of hundreds of au @xcite .",
    "additional insight has been gained by studying planet occurrence as a function of stellar properties .",
    "the properties of stars are closely related to the properties of the circumstellar environment during the early epoch of planet formation .",
    "planet host stars therefore represent an important link between the systems detected today and the processes of planet formation that took place in the past .",
    "for example , studies of the chemical compositions of planet - host stars reveals a strong correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence @xcite .",
    "the probability of a star having a detectable planet rises from roughly 3% around stars with solar iron abundance (  @xmath5 ) , to @xmath6% for stars with  @xmath7 ( figure  [ plotocc ] ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "the planet - metallicity correlation is currently best understood in the context of the core accretion theory of planet formation , in which planets are formed through the collisional buildup of refractory material in the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "a higher stellar metallicity observed today is a reflection of the higher dust content of the disk while planets were forming .",
    "mass is another stellar property closely related to the surface density of solids in the disk midplane , and the core accretion model predicts that planet frequency should correlate with stellar mass @xcite .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed by doppler surveys of stars at either end of the mass scale ( figure  [ plotocc ] ) . at the low  mass end ,",
    "only 4 out of @xmath8 m dwarfs in various doppler surveys have been found to host a jupiter - mass planet @xcite . at the other end of the scale ,",
    "studies of evolved , intermediat - mass stars ( @xmath9  ) on the subgiant and giant branches @xcite have revealed an enhanced planet occurrence rate around high - mass stars , rising from @xmath10% around m dwarfs , to approximately 9% around f and a stars @xcite .",
    "the correlation between planet occurrence and stellar properties not only informs theories of planet formation , but also guides the target selection of future planet searches .",
    "the increased `` planeticity '' of metal - rich stars has been harnessed by several metallicity - biased planet searches to find large numbers of short - period planets around nearby ( @xmath11  pc ) stars @xcite .",
    "the correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence will be an important consideration for the target selection of current and future direct - imaging planet search missions .",
    "indeed , the first imaged planet candidates were discovered around the @xmath12  a - type dwarfs fomalhaut , hr8799 and @xmath0  pic @xcite .",
    "doppler surveys have uncovered a wealth of information about the orbital characteristics of exoplanets .",
    "giant planets around other stars have a wide range of semimajor axes and orbital eccentricities @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nearly circular orbits of the solar system gas giants , the orbits of exoplanets range from circular to comet - like , spanning the range @xmath13 , with a median eccentricity of 0.24 for @xmath14  au ( figure  [ plotprops ] ) .",
    "the observed eccentricity distribution is currently best reproduced by simulations of dynamical interactions among multiple planets immediately following the dissipation of the protoplanetary gas disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* however , see references therein for alternative models . ) .",
    "the distribution of exoplanet minimum masses , , is well fit by the power - law relationship @xmath15 ( figure [ plotprops ] ) , indicating that smaller planets form more readily than massive `` super - jupiters '' and brown dwarfs .",
    "the paucity of planets with  @xmath16  is known as the `` brown dwarf desert , '' and high - contrast imaging surveys show that companions in this mass range are rare even out to large semimajor axes @xcite . however , there are indications that the most massive jovian planets with  @xmath17  and wide orbits ( @xmath18  au ) are more prevalent around massive stars @xcite .",
    "doppler surveys have shown that 1.2% of stars have planets with orbital periods @xmath19  days , corresponding to @xmath20  au @xcite .",
    "these short - period planets are commonly referred to as `` hot jupiters , '' and they likely did not form in situ due to the high temperatures and low surface densities of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks . instead , hot jupiters and other close - in planets most likely formed beyond the `` ice line '' at a few au , and then migrate inward to their present locations @xcite .",
    "the process of inward migration is now thought to be a ubiquitous and integral feature of how planets form @xcite .",
    "planets with orbits that are serendipitously viewed edge  on transit their host stars and provide valuable additional information about the physical and orbital characteristics that can not be studied by doppler techniques alone @xcite .",
    "the sample of known exoplanets includes 52 examples of well - characterized transiting systems .",
    "while the brightest examples ( @xmath21 ) come from photometric follow - up of doppler - detected planets @xcite , the majority of transiting planets were detected by wide - field , photometric surveys @xcite . by monitoring hundreds of thousands of stars per night using networks of small - aperture , wide - field cameras ,",
    "these surveys have uncovered a diverse collection of short - period planets with a wide range of masses , radii and orbital configurations @xcite .",
    "the orbit solution of doppler - detected planets yields the minimum mass of the planet , , but the light curve of a transiting planet yields a direct measure of the planet s inclination , providing an absolute measure of the planet s mass , assuming the stellar mass is known by other means .",
    "the depth of the photometric dip is related to the planet s radius ( upper panel of figure  [ transit ] ) .",
    "the mass and radius together give the mean density , which can be compared to theoretical models of planetary interiors to provide a glimpse of their interior structures @xcite .",
    "modeling efforts of this type have revealed that enhanced heavy element abundance , ostensibly in the form of a large solid core , is a common feature of hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "the growing sample of transiting planets exhibit heavy - element masses ranging from tens of earth masses up to @xmath22 . for comparison ,",
    "jupiter is composed of 139  @xmath23 of heavy elements , and has a core mass ranging from 011  @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "notably , the core masses of transiting planets correlate with the metal abundances of the host stars , a finding that lends additional support for the core accretion model of planet formation @xcite .    while many transiting exoplanets have large cores , others have radii that far exceed the predictions of the current suite of planetary interior models , even if a heavy - element core is omitted .",
    "these bloated planets pose serious challenges to theoretical models of planetary interiors @xcite .",
    "the solution may lie in improved stellar age estimates , revised atmospheric opacities or a better understanding of chemistry and dynamics in planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "planet transits also yield a measure of an additional fundamental orbital characteristic of planetary systems : the spin - orbit alignment @xcite",
    ". measurements of a host star s radial velocity during the transit of its planet can reveal anomalous doppler - shift variations known as the rossiter - mclaugnlin effect @xcite , and the time - dependent variation of this effect is related to the projected angle between the star s spin axis and the planet s orbit normal , @xmath24 ( lower panel of figure  [ transit ] ) .",
    "the spin - orbit angle is a fundamental property of planetary systems , analogous to the eccentricity and semimajor axis .",
    "the majority of measured exoplanet spin - orbit angles are consistent with @xmath25 , and a single , isotropic distribution for exoplanet spin - orbit angles can be ruled out with high confidence , even after accounting for projection effects @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the dominant mechanism responsible for the inward migration of planets preserves spin - orbit alignment ( although @xcite and @xcite present a notable exception in the misaligned xo-3 system ) .    half an orbital period after a planet transit ,",
    "another observational opportunity arises when the planet passes behind the parent star .",
    "observations made during these occultation events provide a means of detecting light from the planet itself , as revealed by the flux decrement caused by the star blocking the light from the planet @xcite .",
    "the variation in the depth of the occultation light curve measured in different bandpasses provides a measure of the planet s emission spectrum , which can then be compared to theoretical models to gain insights into the characteristics of planetary atmospheres .",
    "observations of this type made with space - based facilities such as _ spitzer space telescope _ , the _ hubble space telescope _ and",
    "most , have revealed evidence of temperature inversions in the atmospheres of some planets @xcite ; detected molecules such as h@xmath260 and co@xmath26 in their atmospheres @xcite ; placed limits on their wavelength - dependent bond albedos @xcite ; and have been used to measure their eccentricities based on the time interval between primary and secondary eclipse @xcite .",
    "there are 31 known multi - planet systems orbiting nearby stars with well - characterized orbits ( figure [ plotmulti ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these systems , together with single - planet systems with additional radial velocity trends , comprise 30% of all known planetary systems within 200  pc .",
    "five of the known multi - planet systems systems are in mean - motion resonances , and two are known to contain four or more planets : the system of five planets around 55 cnc and the four - planet system around @xmath27  ara @xcite .",
    "the characterization of multi - planet systems requires intensive follow - up observations , and the additional scrutiny has resulted in the detection of some of the least massive planets currently known .",
    "the gl876 , 55  cnc and @xmath27  ara systems all contain low - mass planets that were discovered by intensive doppler follow - up , with  @xmath28 , 10.8 and 15  @xmath23 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the discovery of multi - planet systems has been aided by improvements to the attainable doppler precision , resulting in planetary systems containing multiple neptune- and sub - neptune - mass planets @xcite .",
    "the increasing time baselines of doppler surveys , together with the sensitivity of microlensing surveys , are bringing solar system analogs within reach @xcite .",
    "multi - planet systems are valuable testing grounds for theories of planet formation and migration @xcite . for example",
    ", planets should form at arbitrary locations within the protoplanetary disk , and yet several multi - planet systems have been detected in mean - motion resonances .",
    "these systems indicate that systems of planets migrate inward and are subsequently captured into resonant configurations @xcite",
    ". comparisons between the properties of multi - planet systems and those of systems containing only a single detectable planet provide important observational constraints for theories of planet - planet and disk - planet interactions @xcite .",
    "the low - mass planets in short - period orbits detected by doppler - based planet searches @xcite and those at wider separations detected via gravitational microlensing @xcite point the way toward the future of exoplanet science : the detection and characterization of earth - like planets .",
    "one of the primary goals of the study of exoplanets is to determine whether solar systems like our own exist elsewhere in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of an earth - mass planet in the terrestrial zone of a sun - like star ( late f - type to early k ) poses a considerable technical challenge .",
    "these small planets induce radial velocity variations of @xmath29  cm  s@xmath30 , astrometric variations of a @xmath31  microacrseconds ( @xmath27as ) , transit depths of @xmath32 , and have planet - star contrast ratios of @xmath33 to @xmath34 , for reflected light and thermal emission , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one immediate method of circumventing these technical hurdles is to first search for habitable worlds around m dwarfs .",
    "the amplitude of the doppler variations induced by a planet of a given mass in the habitable zone of a star scale as @xmath35 , and the transit depth scales as @xmath36 ( assuming @xmath37 for he lower main sequence ) .",
    "the detection sensitivities are therefore an order of magnitude higher around a 0.25  m dwarf compared to a solar - type star",
    ". targeted photometric and doppler searches for transiting terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of m dwarfs are currently underway @xcite .",
    "the low - mass planetary system tantalizingly close to the habitable zone of the 0.4  m dwarf gl581 demonstrates the promise of searching for planets around low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets around sun - like stars can be estimated from the frequency of exoplanets with masses intermediate to earth and neptune , commonly known as `` super - earths .",
    "'' planets with masses @xmath38 in short - period orbits are readily detectable by doppler surveys capable of @xmath39  precision , and several dedicated searches are currently underway using harps and keck / hires @xcite .",
    "while these planets have masses approaching the earth s , it remains unclear whether they are earth - like with solid surfaces , or instead miniature neptunes with massive envelopes of h and he @xcite .",
    "this issue will soon be addressed by the detection of transiting super - earths around nearby , bright ( @xmath40 ) stars , for which doppler follow - up can provide precise mass measurements .",
    "the recent demonstrations of sub - millimagnitude , ground - based transit photometry , together with the growing number of low - mass planets in short - period orbits suggest that the first nearby ( @xmath41  pc ) transiting super - earth will be detected in the near future @xcite .    searching for earth - analogs around sun - like stars",
    "is best pursued above the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the corot and _ kepler _ space missions will provide continuous high - precision photometric monitoring of hundreds of thousands of stars within select patches of the sky to detect planets with a wide range of masses and orbital characteristics .",
    "early results from corot demonstrate the advantages afforded by observing from space , both in terms of attainable photometric precision and continuous temporal coverage , which increases detection sensitivity at longer orbital periods compared to ground - based surveys @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission launched successfully in march of this year and will maintain a photometric precision of 20 micro - magnitudes over the course of 4 years @xcite .",
    "the precision and time baseline of _ kepler _ will provide a galactic census of terrestrial planets around sun - like stars out to separations of 12 au .",
    "the transiting systems detected by _ kepler _ and corot will open up exciting new science directions for the next generation space observatories such as the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) , including atmospheric transmission spectroscopy and measuring the phase variations of thermal and reflected light @xcite .",
