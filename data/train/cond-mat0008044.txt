    "the finite temperature properties of the two dimensional hubbard model have been extensively studied both analytically and numerically.@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is especially effective at half - filling , where there is no sign problem . from calculations of the magnetic structure factor ,",
    "susceptibility , compressibility , density of states , and the electron self  energy , a clear picture has emerged concerning the nature of the short and long range magnetic order , the mott gap , and the quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "while the specific heat @xmath2 has been computed by a number of groups in one - dimension , principally by bethe ansatz techniques@xcite , there have been few qmc studies of @xmath2 for the two and three dimensional hubbard models.@xcite the behavior for large @xmath0 is well understood and one expects , as in the one dimensional case , a two peak structure in @xmath2 , with a broad high temperature peak at @xmath1 associated with `` charge fluctuations '' , and a narrower peak at lower temperatures associated with `` spin fluctuations '' .",
    "this two peak structure of the hubbard model can be understood from a strong coupling viewpoint as follows : at temperatures which exceed the on  site repulsion , @xmath3 , the up and down electrons are decoupled , @xmath4 , at half  filling , and the local moment @xmath5 , its uncorrelated value . at the temperature scale @xmath1 , double occupancy begins to be suppressed , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "since the potential energy in the hubbard model is just @xmath8 , this growth in the local moment is synonymous with a decrease in the potential energy as @xmath9 decreases , and hence a peak in @xmath2 at @xmath10 .",
    "once moments are formed , the half  filled hubbard model maps onto the spin1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , with exchange constant @xmath11 , whose specific heat has a peak at @xmath12 associated with magnetic ordering . in sum",
    ", one expects @xmath2 for the strong coupling hubbard model at half  filling to have a `` charge peak '' at @xmath10 and a `` spin peak '' at @xmath13 .",
    "this strong coupling argument further suggests that the temperature derivatives of the potential and kinetic energies are associated with the high and low temperature specific heat peaks respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the specific heat for small @xmath0 in the two dimensional hubbard model is still unclear .",
    "in particular , it is not known whether a two peak structure is present for all values of the interaction or if these coalesce into a single peak at small @xmath0 .",
    "that the two peaks might merge is suggested by the fact that the charge and spin energy scales , @xmath0 and @xmath14 , approach each other as @xmath0 is decreased .",
    "however , the situation is not so straightforward , because the strong coupling form for the energy scale for spin ordering crosses over to a weak coupling expression@xcite @xmath15 , which at small @xmath0 is still well - separated from the energy scales @xmath16 and @xmath0 .",
    "the qmc results reported in this work are consistent with such weak coupling behavior at small @xmath0 .",
    "that is , one of our key findings is that @xmath2 shows two distinct peaks which persist to couplings an order of magnitude less than the noninteracting bandwidth .",
    "it may be that the half - filled two - dimensional hubbard model is unique in this respect , since , as we review below , studies in one dimension and within dmft show a merging of the peaks at values of @xmath0 roughly equal to the bandwidth .",
    "indeed , the two  dimensional half  filled hubbard model on a square lattice has unusual nesting features in its noninteracting band structure , as well as a logarithmic divergence of its density of states at the fermi level which have previously been noted to enhance antiferromagnetism anomalously.@xcite    whether this is the case or not , there is as yet no compelling evidence of the appearence of a weak coupling energy scale @xmath17 in the specific heat in other dimensions . in one dimension , exact diagonalization in small chains@xcite and qmc calculations@xcite",
    "suggest the two peaks merge , but disagree with respect to the interaction strength at which this occurs .",
    "exact diagonalization is limited to chains of very modest extent , and finite size effects tend to be large for small u. meanwhile , qmc work did not reach low enough temperatures to resolve the two peaks even for large values of @xmath0 where they almost certainly both exist . bethe  ansatz calculations help clarify this issue , but focus on the large @xmath0 limit@xcite . despite these various caveats , the consensus of these approaches is that the spin and charge peaks merge at @xmath18 , the one  dimensional bandwidth .",
    "quantum transfer matrix calculations @xcite also show the merging of the two peaks at @xmath18 .",
    "coalescence of the specific heat peaks has also been seen in `` dynamical mean field theory '' ( dmft ) which studies the system in the limit of high dimension.@xcite there , the hubbard model is studied with a gaussian density of states of unit variance , and the spin and charge peaks are found to merge at @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that the band ",
    "width is undefined complicates comparisons with results in finite dimension , but one can still examine the ratio of @xmath0 to the kinetic energy per particle , which is finite for a gaussian density of states .",
    "the value @xmath18 in two dimensions has the same ratio of @xmath0 to kinetic energy as the interaction strength at which the two peak structure is lost in dmft .",
    "however , an additional difficulty in the interpretation of the dmft results , besides the use of a gaussian density of states , is the restriction of the calculations to the paramagnetic phase , and therefore the neglect of antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present a detailed study of the temperature dependence of the local moment and the associated features in the specific heat for the half  filled two  dimensional hubbard hamiltonian",
    ". a focus of our work will be on extending the strong coupling picture of the two peak structure of @xmath2 to intermediate and weak coupling .",
    "as we shall show , the connection of moment formation and moment ordering with the high and low temperature peaks ( respectively ) in the specific heat is modified . at the same time , we will describe two recently developed techniques for computing the specific heat which hold certain advantages over approaches previously used .",
    "these new techniques also allow us to compute the entropy and free energy , quantities typically not so easy to obtain with monte carlo .",
    "a fascinating conclusion of the dmft studies@xcite concerned the existence of a universal crossing point of the specific heat curves for different @xmath0 .",
    "we shall show such a crossing occurs also in two dimensions .",
    "finally , we will discuss results for dynamical quantities like the density of states and optical conductivity and comment on their consistency with the local moment and specific heat .",

    "we use determinant qmc@xcite to evaluate the expectation values above .",
    "this approach treats the electron ",
    "electron correlations exactly , and at half  filling , where we focus this work , is able to produce results with very small statistical fluctuations at temperatures low enough that the ground state has been reached .",
    "the technique is limited to finite size lattices , and we will show appropriate scaling analyses to argue that we extract the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will evaluate the specific heat in three ways@xcite .",
    "all begin by using qmc to obtain @xmath39 and the associated error bars @xmath40 at a sufficiently fine grid of @xmath41 discrete temperatures @xmath42 .",
    "the first approach is straightforward numerical differentiation of the energy @xmath43 .",
    "the second utilizes a fit to the numerical data for the energy @xmath43 , and the third is an approach using the me method to invert the data @xmath43 to obtain a spectrum of excitations of the system .",

    "previous studies in two dimensions@xcite exhibit crossings of the specific heat at @xmath85 , with a crossing region @xmath86 . in fig .",
    "[ crossing ] we confirm this result that a specific heat crossing occurs in two dimensions . while the crossings in the earlier study@xcite shift systematically with @xmath0 , we instead see a random fluctuation of the crossing point .",
    "this suggests that the width of the crossing we report here is dominated by statistical fluctuations as opposed to possible systematic effects .",

    "finally , recent work suggests that the pseudogap exists in the thermodynamic limit at weak coupling and is not a finite size effect there.@xcite      the density of states itself does not present a complete picture of the nature of the excitation gap .",
    "a more refined view may be obtained by looking at the optical conductivity , as shown in figs .",
    "these results show that the hubbard model has a non ",
    "zero charge gap , even at weak to intermediate coupling where @xmath0 is less than the bandwidth .",
    "we examine the dynamic spin susceptibility ( not shown ) and find the spin gap to vanish since the 2d hubbard model has long range magnetic order at @xmath66 and hence ungapped , power law , spin wave excitations .",
    "in this paper we have examined carefully the low temperature structure of the local moment and specific heat of the two dimensional hubbard model .",
    "a striking conclusion of our work is that the two peak structure in the specific heat is preserved down to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the bandwidth . in one dimension",
    ", the coalescence of the spin and charge peaks appears to occur at much larger @xmath0 , namely the one dimensional bandwidth .",
    "meanwhile , in infinite dimension , the peaks also come together at an interaction strength associated with an average kinetic energy per particle corresponding to half the two dimensional bandwidth .",
    "however , we have pointed out that the argument that the peaks come together which is based on a comparison of the scales @xmath125 and @xmath0 might be flawed , as the weak coupling spin energy scale is instead set by @xmath15 .",
    "this leaves open the question of why the separation of the specific heat energy scales is maximal in intermediate dimension .",
    "possibly the half - filled two - dimensional hubbard model is unique due to the unusual characteristics of its noninteracting states at the fermi energy.@xcite however , it should also be recalled that the dmft studies have been restricted to the paramagnetic phase , which may have an important impact on the existence of two well defined peaks .",
    "finally the existence of the nagaoka state in two dimensions , but not in one or infinite dimensions , indicates that there may be no reason to expect systematic behavior here as a function of dimension.@xcite    we have emphasized that the standard nomenclature which identifies the high temperature peak in the specific heat as due to `` charge '' fluctuations and the low temperature peak as due to `` spin '' fluctuations while useful at strong coupling , needs to be refined . at weak coupling ,",
    "the high temperature peak comes from the kinetic energy while the low temperature peak comes from the potential energy . by comparing with the behavior of the density of states ,",
    "we have argued that the structure of @xmath2 may be associated with `` pseudogap '' formation , that is , the onset of short range antiferromagnetic correlations between near  neighbor spins .",
    "a detailed understanding of the relationship of the energy and local moment formation is desirable in a number of contexts in using model hamiltonians to describe strongly correlated materials . in particular , while minimization of the energy determines the dominant low temperature phases , the various types of behavior of the local moment ( for example screening by conduction electrons in multi  band models ) can also provide important clues concerning the suitability of different models in describing the low temperature physics.@xcite    0.2 in work at ucd was supported by the cnpq - brazil , the llnl materials research institute , and nsf  dmr9985978 ; that at llnl , by the u.s .",

    "the weak coupling form of the nel temperature comes from the random phase approximation condition @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the noninteracting spin susceptibility , @xmath128 as emphasized by hirsch , the simultaneous occurrence of nesting and a logarithmic van ",
    "hove singularity in the density of states of the two  dimensional hubbard model at half  filling introduces a square root in the exponential which describes the rpa form of the spin fluctuation energy scale .                            in classical monte carlo ,",
    "the best approach to evaluate @xmath2 is often to use the fluctuation formula @xmath131 .",
    "this is not a useful way to proceed for determinant quantum monte carlo because the square of the hamiltonian involves products of six and eight fermion operators , and the associated expectation values have large fluctuations .          at @xmath90 ,",
    "the term @xmath67 arises from momenta states at the fermi surface , i.e.  with @xmath132 which do not contribute ln@xmath133 to the entropy .",
    "such @xmath134 are a finite fraction of the total momentum values for calculations on finite clusters , but decrease in weight as the lattice size is increased .",
    "similarly , within mean field theory , the hamiltonian for finite @xmath0 can be diagonalized to give rise to single particle energy bands , and @xmath67 is again determined by the states at the fermi surface .",
    "for the half  filled hubbard model , in the paramagnetic phase , regardless of @xmath0 , the same states are at @xmath135 , and @xmath67 is fixed for a given periodic cluster size . for the antiferromagnetic phase the bands are split away from @xmath135 , and so @xmath136 . with an exact treatment of correlations , such as qmc provides , it is not _ a priori _ completely clear what the value of @xmath67 is .",
    "we found @xmath136 for the 2d hubbard model for our finite periodic clusters over a range of @xmath137 .",
    "our qmc data agree precisely with earlier work , which , however , did not go to quite so low temperatures and also used a more coarse temperature grid , and hence apparently did not detect the second low @xmath9 structure .",
