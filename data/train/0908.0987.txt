    "over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been made on higher - dimensional field theories where some of the spatial coordinates are compactified on certain topological manifolds .",
    "such theories are found to possess unexpectedly rich properties that shed new light and give a deep understanding on high energy physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that new mechanisms of gauge symmetry breaking @xcite , spontaneous supersymmetry breaking @xcite , and breaking of translational invariance @xcite can occur , and that various phase structures arise in field theoretical models on such space - time @xcite .",

    "if the gauge symmetry breaking of @xmath6 to @xmath7 is given by the higgs mechanism , the gauge symmetry will be restored at high temperature , since one - loop corrections to the higgs mass squared are proportional to @xmath8 with positive coefficients at high temperature @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking via gauge fields for extra dimensions is expected to exhibit quite different behavior at high temperature .",
    "this is because the uv cutoff dependence is directly related to the high temperature corrections @xcite and because quantum corrections to the zero modes of such gauge fields are expected to be uv finite due to the higher - dimensional gauge symmetry ( while higgs mass corrections are quadratically divergent ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory with an extra dimension of a circle at finite temperature , in which there are two order parameters of gauge symmetry breaking : one is the zero mode of the gauge field for the direction of the euclidean time , and the other is that for the extra dimension .",
    "we evaluate the effective potential for the zero modes in the one - loop approximation and clarify the vacuum configuration at finite temperature .",
    "our results show that at high temperature the expectation value of the gauge field for the extra dimension in the @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory on a circle can be effectively determined by a @xmath1-dimensional theory defined by removing the euclidean time coordinate and all of the fermions from the original @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory on the circle and that the gauge symmetry nonrestoration ( snr ) and/or the inverse symmetry breaking ( isb ) can occur at high temperature in a class of such gauge theories .",

    "the @xmath118 in the four - dimensional gauge theory is numerically found to be @xmath142 .",
    "this is the same as ( [ shiki5 - 8 ] ) obtained by the original five - dimensional gauge theory at the high temperature limit .",
    "we have presented the models with the symmetry nonrestoration and the inverse symmetry breaking at high temperature .",
    "we note that at high temperature the model is described by the four - dimensional @xmath130 gauge theory including only bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the nontrivial boundary condition @xmath67 for the scalar fields is crucial for the two interesting phenomena at high temperature .",
    "let us finally present a model which has both the usual symmetry restoration of the @xmath13 gauge symmetry and the inverse symmetry breaking in the intermediate range of @xmath119 .",

    "respect to @xmath119 in the model ( [ shiki5 - 9 ] ) .",
    "the first ( second ) jump of the vacuum expectation value occurs at @xmath145 .",
    "the asymptotic value for @xmath90 is about @xmath128 , which is consistent with the one obtained by the four - dimensional gauge theory explained in the text.,width=340 ]    the first order phase transition occurs at @xmath146 , and the @xmath13 gauge symmetry is restored like the usual higgs mechanism .",
    "the second phase transition , which is again first order , occurs at @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath13 gauge symmetry is again broken to @xmath126 at high temperature .",
    "the asymptotic value for @xmath90 is @xmath148 .",
    "this model belongs to the class of the inverse symmetry breaking at high temperature , but the model has the usual symmetry restoration of the @xmath13 gauge symmetry in the intermediate range of the temperature .",
    "this is similar to the phase transition discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory with an extra dimension of a circle , in particular at high and low temperature .",
    "the theory possesses two order parameters of gauge symmetry breaking : one is the zero mode of the gauge field for the euclidean time direction and the other is that for the direction of the extra dimension .",
    "we have evaluated the effective potential for the order parameters in the one - loop approximation and succeeded in expressing it in three different forms : one is suitable for high temperature / large extra dimension , another is suitable for low temperature / a small extra dimension , and the third one is useful for numerical computations . using those expressions and mainly focusing on the expectation value @xmath38 of the extra component of the gauge field , we have found that at high temperature the effective potential for @xmath38 in the @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory on the circle reduces to that in a @xmath1-dimensional theory defined by removing the euclidean time coordinate and all of the fermions from the original theory , while at low temperature it is determined by the original @xmath0-dimensional gauge theory on the circle at zero temperature .",
    "this result leads to the conclusion that the gauge symmetry nonrestoration and/or the inverse symmetry breaking at high temperature can occur in a class of gauge theories on a circle with appropriate matter contents .    as a demonstration",
    ", we have presented @xmath113 gauge models on a circle that cause the gauge symmetry nonrestoration or the inverse symmetry breaking to indeed occur at high temperature .",
    "those properties should be contrasted to the gauge symmetry breaking induced by the higgs mechanism . in this case ,",
    "one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass squared will be proportional to @xmath8 with positive coefficients at high temperature , so that the gauge symmetry is expected to be restored at high temperature @xcite .",
    "we have further discussed that phase transitions in such a class of gauge theories are , in general , first order and have shown that it is actually the case for the models we have studied .",
    "considering the higher rank gauge group such as @xmath149 is one of the simplest extensions of our studies .",
    "there are more symmetry breaking patterns through @xmath38 for that case than the case of @xmath13 .",
    "we expect a rich variety of vacuum structure at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "we can also easily extend the expressions of ( [ shiki3 - 15 ] ) and ( [ shiki3 - 19 ] ) to gauge theories with extra dimensions of a higher - dimensional tori @xmath150 .",
    "then the one - loop effective potential can be expressed in the following two ways : @xmath151 where @xmath152 it immediately follows that at high temperature the vacuum configuration for @xmath153 can be determined by the @xmath1-dimensional ( zero temperature ) gauge theory on the tori @xmath154 without fermions , while at low temperature it can be determined by the original @xmath0-dimensional zero temperature gauge theory on @xmath154 , so that the gauge symmetry nonrestoration and/or the inverse symmetry breaking at high temperature can occur in a class of gauge theories compactified on @xmath154 .",
    "we would like to make some comments on high and low temperature approximations and also higher order effects .",
    "we have shown that the one - loop effective potential ( [ shiki3 - 10 ] ) can be written into the two other different forms ( [ shiki3 - 15 ] ) and ( [ shiki3 - 19 ] ) . the expression ( [ shiki3 - 15 ] ) ( ( [ shiki3 - 19 ] ) ) is useful for the analysis at high ( low ) temperature @xmath90 ( @xmath108 ) because contributions of the nonzero matsubara ( kaluza - klein ) modes are exponentially suppressed .",
    "those modes , however , become important at @xmath155 , and high ( low ) temperature approximations will break down .",
    "then the analyses of the one - loop effective potential at @xmath155 may be performed by numerical computations with the original expression ( [ shiki3 - 10 ] ) .",
    "the above observation suggests that a phase transition will occur at a critical temperature @xmath156 of order @xmath89 if the high temperature vacuum configuration is different from the low temperature one .",
    "this has been confirmed for the models studied in the section @xmath12 .",
    "our considerations are restricted to the one - loop approximation .",
    "higher order effects could alter one - loop results .",
    "one such effect will be temperature - dependent mass corrections . at two - loop order ,",
    "the squared mass @xmath157 of the matsubara mode @xmath76 could acquire a mass correction @xmath158 .",
    "has mass dimension @xmath159 , so that @xmath160 has mass dimension @xmath9 . ]",
    "then @xmath75 in ( [ shiki3 - 14 ] ) is expected to be replaced by @xmath161 . if @xmath162 , _ i.e. _ @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a @xmath165 dimensionless coupling constant , contributions of all of the bosonic modes would be exponentially suppressed like fermionic ones .",
    "therefore , for such a high temperature region , higher order effects should be considered properly .",
    "our results suggest that if the gauge symmetry breaking was caused not by higgs fields but by gauge fields of extra dimensions , the gauge symmetry could not be restored at the early universe or the gauge symmetry could be restored with the first order phase transition .",
    "it would be of great importance to investigate cosmological implications in such a scenario .",
