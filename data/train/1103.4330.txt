    "investigation of the heavy mesons can play essential role in understanding the vacuum properties of the nonperturbative qcd @xcite . in particular , analysis of the variation of the parameters of the heavy quarkonia , namely bottonium ( @xmath3 ) and charmonium ( @xmath4 ) in hadronic medium with respect to the temperature",
    "can give valuable information about the qcd vacuum and transition to the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase .",
    "determination of the hadronic properties of the vector mesons in hot and dense qcd medium has become one of the most important research subject in the last twenty years both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "@xmath0 suppression effect due to color screening can be considered as an important evidence for qgp @xcite .",
    "this suppression effect has been observed experimentally in heavy ion collision experiments held in super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl .",
    "properties of the heavy mesons in vacuum have been probed widely in the literature using the nonperturbative approaches like qcd sum rules , nonrelativistic potential models , lattice theory , heavy quark effective theory and chiral perturbation theory . however , in expansion of most of these models to finite temperature we are face to face with some difficulties .",
    "qcd sum rules which is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) , qcd lagrangian and quark - hadron duality , is one of the most informative , applicable and predictive models in hadron physics @xcite . the thermal version of this model proposed by bochkarev and shaposhnikov @xcite has some new features at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one of the new feature is the interaction of the particles existing in the medium with the currents which demands the modification of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "the other new picture of the thermal qcd is breakdown of the lorentz invariance via the choice of reference frame . due to residual o(3 ) symmetry at finite temperature ,",
    "more operators with the same dimensions appear in the ope comparing to the qcd sum rules in vacuum .",
    "thermal version of qcd sum rules has been successfully used to study the thermal properties of light @xcite , heavy - light@xcite and heavy - heavy @xcite mesons as a trusty and well - established approach .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the mases and decay constants of the heavy vector quarkonia @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) in the framework of the thermal qcd sum rules . using the thermal quark propagator",
    ", we calculate the expression for the spectral density in one loop approach . taking into account also the two loop perturbative contributions in @xmath8 order @xcite as well as new nonperturbative contributions arising in thermal qcd in addition to vacuum version , we acquire thermal qcd sum rules for the masses and decay constants . using the results of the energy density for the interval",
    "@xmath9 obtained via chiral perturbation theory @xcite as well as the values of the energy density and gluon condensates obtained in the region @xmath10 via lattice qcd @xcite , we present the sensitivity of the masses and decay constants of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 heavy vector mesons on the temperature . in our calculations",
    ", we also use the temperature dependent two loop expression for the strong coupling constant obtained using the perturbation theory and improved by the lattice results @xcite .",
    "we see that the values of the decay constants decrease considerably near to the critical or deconfinement temperature comparing to their values in vacuum .",
    "this can be considered as a sign of the qgp phase transition .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next two sections ,",
    "we derive thermal qcd sum rules for the considered observables .",
    "the last section is devoted to the numerical analysis of the observables and present their temperature dependency as well as our discussion .",
    "to obtain the thermal qcd sum rules for physical quantities , we need to calculate the convenient thermal correlation function in two different ways : in terms of qcd degrees of freedom and in terms of hadronic parameters .",
    "in qcd side , the correlation function is evaluated via ope which helps us expand the time ordering product of currents in terms of operators with different dimensions . in the present section ,",
    "we obtain the ope for the considered quantities .",
    "we begin by considering the following two point thermal correlation function : @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 or @xmath14 is the vector current , @xmath15 indicates the time ordered product and @xmath16 is the thermal density matrix of qcd at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "as we previously mentioned , the lorentz invariance breaks down via the choice of reference frame at which the matter is at rest .",
    "however , using the four velocity vector @xmath18 of the matter , we can define lorentz invariant quantities such as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by the help of these quantities ,",
    "the aforesaid thermal correlation function can be expressed in terms of two independent tensors @xmath21 and @xmath22 at finite temperature @xcite , i.e. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the following lorentz invariant functions : @xmath28 @xmath29 it can be shown that in the limit @xmath30 , the @xmath27 function can be expressed as @xmath31 @xcite and one can easily find the @xmath32 relation between two @xmath26 and @xmath27 functions . in real time thermal field theory , the function @xmath33 or @xmath34 can be written in @xmath35 matrix form and elements of this matrix depend on only one analytic function @xcite .",
    "therefore , calculation of the 11-component of this matrix is sufficient to determine completely the dynamics of the corresponding two - point function .",
    "it can also be shown that in the fixed value of @xmath36 , the spectral representation of the thermal correlation function can be written as @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39      in our calculations , we also take into account the perturbative two - loop order @xmath69 correction to the spectral density .",
    "this correction at zero temperature can be written as @xcite : @xmath70,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , we replace the strong coupling @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( [ pi1 ] ) with its temperature dependent lattice improved expression @xmath71 @xcite , here    @xmath72.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "now , we proceed to calculate the nonperturbative part in qcd side . for this aim",
    ", we use the nonperturbative part of the quark propagator in an external gluon field , @xmath75 in the fock - schwinger gauge , @xmath76 . taking into account one and two gluon lines attached to the quark line",
    ", the massive quark propagator can be written in momentum space as @xcite : @xmath77 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{i}{4 } g^2 ( t^{c}t^{d})^{aa^{\\prime}}g^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta}(0)g^{d}_{\\mu\\nu}(0 ) \\frac{\\not\\!k+m}{(k^2-m^2)^5}(f_{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}+f_{\\alpha\\mu\\beta\\nu } + f_{\\alpha\\mu\\nu\\beta})(\\not\\!k+m),\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath78 to go on , we also need to know the expectation value @xmath79 .",
    "the lorentz covariance at finite temperature permits us to write the general structure of this expectation value in the following manner : @xmath80\\langle u^{\\lambda } { \\theta}^g _ { \\lambda \\sigma } u^{\\sigma}\\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath81 as we also previously mentioned is the four - velocity of the heat bath and it is introduced to restore lorentz invariance formally in the thermal field theory . in the rest frame of the heat bath @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath84 is the traceless gluonic part of the stress - tensor of the qcd . up to terms required for our calculations ,",
    "the non perturbative part of massive quark propagator at finite temperature is obtained as : @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{i~g^2~\\delta^{aa^{\\prime } } } { 3~(k^2-m^2)^4}\\big\\{\\frac{m ( k^2+m \\not\\!k)}{4}\\langle g^{c}_{\\alpha\\beta}g^{c\\alpha\\beta}\\rangle+\\frac{1}{3(k^2-m^2 ) } \\big [ m ( k^2-m^2)\\big(k^2 - 4(k\\cdot u)^2\\big ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( m^2-k^2)\\big(-m^2 + 4(k\\cdot u)^2\\big)\\not\\!k+4(k\\cdot u)(m^2-k^2)^2\\not\\!u\\big]\\langle u^{\\alpha}\\theta^{g}_{\\alpha\\beta}u^{\\beta}\\rangle\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the above expression and after straightforward but lengthy calculations , the nonperturbative part in qcd side is obtained as : @xmath86 ^ 4}\\big[6q^6(-1+x)^4x^4 + 6m^2q^4x^2(-1+x)^2 ( 1 - 6x+6x^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & m^6(5 - 32x+42x^2 - 20x^3 + 10x^4)+m^4q^2x\\big(-14 + 95x-140x^2 + 65 ^ 3 + 6x^4 - 2x^5\\big)\\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\alpha_{s}\\langle u^{\\alpha}\\theta^{g}_{\\alpha\\beta}u^{\\beta}\\rangle}{54 \\pi \\big[m^2 + q^2(-1+x)x\\big]^4}\\big[x(-1+x ) \\big(4q^4x^2(1 - 3x+2x^2)^2+m^4(12 - 35x+21x^2 + 28x^3\\nonumber\\\\&-&14x^4 ) + m^2q^2x",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and perform integral over @xmath88 . isolating the ground state ,",
    "we get @xmath89 where the hadronic states @xmath90 form a complete set and @xmath91 indicate the contributions of excited vector mesons and continuum states .    in order to obtain thermal sum rules",
    ", now we equate the spectral representation and results of operator product expansion for amplitudes @xmath33 or @xmath34 at sufficiently high @xmath92 .",
    "when performing numerical results , we should exchange our reference to one at which the particle is at rest , i.e. , we shall set @xmath30 . in this limit since the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are related to each other , it is enough to use one of them to acquire thermal sum rules . here , we use the function @xmath27 .",
    "when we use the standard spectral representation , if the spectral density at @xmath93 does not approach to zero , in this case the correlation function is expressed in terms of a diverge integral .",
    "in such a case , to overcome this problem , we subtract first few terms of its taylor expansion at @xmath94 from @xmath34 , @xmath95 equating the ope and hadronic representations of the correlation function and applying quark - hadron duality , our sum - rule takes the form : @xmath96 } { s^2(s+q_0 ^ 2)}ds+\\int_{0}^{|\\textbf{q}|^2 } \\frac{\\rho_{t , s}}{s+q_0 ^ 2}ds+\\pi_{t}^{nonpert},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for simplicity , the total decay width of meson has been neglected .",
    "the decay constant @xmath97 is defined by the matrix element of the current @xmath98 between the vacuum and the vector - meson state , i.e. , @xmath99 in derivation of eq .",
    "( [ f2q4 ] ) we have also used summation over polarization states , @xmath100 .",
    "the borel transformation removes subtraction terms in the dispersion relation and also exponentially suppresses the contributions coming from the excited resonances and continuum states heavier than considered vector ground states .",
    "applying borel transformation with respect to @xmath92 to both sides of eq.([f2q4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath101e^{-\\frac{s}{m^2 } } + \\int^{|\\textbf{q}|^2}_{0}ds~\\rho_{t , s}(s)e^{-\\frac{s}{m^2}}+\\widehat{b}\\pi^{nonpert}_t .\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we also previously mentioned , when doing numerical analysis , we will set @xmath30 representing the rest frame of the particle . in this case",
    ", the scattering cut shrinks to a point and the spectral density becomes a singular function .",
