    "let @xmath0 be a compact @xmath1-dimensional manifold with @xmath2 boundary @xmath3 and unit exterior normal @xmath4 we consider the steklov eigenvalue problem @xmath5 the solutions @xmath6 are called steklov eigenfunctions .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the boundary restriction map .",
    "the boundary restrictions of the steklov eigenfunctions , @xmath8 , are the eigenfunctions of the dirichlet - to - neumann ( sometimes also referred to as the poincar ",
    "steklov ) operator @xmath9 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath9 is a first - order homogeneous , self - adjoint , elliptic pseudodifferential operator @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the steklov spectrum , which coincides with the spectrum of @xmath9 , consists of an infinite sequence of eigenvalues @xmath12 with @xmath13 as @xmath14    recently , there has been a significant interest in the study of the nodal geometry for the steklov problem , see @xcite .",
    "however , these results were concerned with the nodal sets of the dirichlet - to - neumann eigenfunctions @xmath15 , i.e. the boundary nodal sets .",
    "the present paper focusses on the interior nodal sets , i.e. the nodal sets of the steklov eigenfunctions  @xmath16 . with the exception of the recent preprint @xcite",
    "( see remark [ swz ] ) , very little has been previously known on this subject .",
    "we also note that courant type bounds were earlier obtained on the number of the interior ( in any dimension ) and boundary ( in dimension two ) nodal domains of steklov eigenfunctions ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .      motivated by a celebrated conjecture of yau @xcite , it has been recently suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open problem 11 ( i ) ) that the ratio between the @xmath17dimensional hausdorff measure of the nodal set of a steklov eigenfunction @xmath16 and the corresponding steklov eigenvalue @xmath18 is bounded above and below by some positive constants depending only on the geometry of the manifold .",
    "our main result below gives a positive answer to this conjecture for real - analytic riemannian surfaces .",
    "note that , in this case , the @xmath19-dimensional hausdorff measure of a nodal set @xmath20 is simply equal to its total length , which we will denote by @xmath21 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath0 be a real - analytic compact riemannian surface with boundary .",
    "then there exist constants @xmath22 such that , for any steklov eigenfunction @xmath16 with an eigenvalue @xmath23 , the total length of its nodal set @xmath20 satisfies : @xmath24    this result may be viewed as an analogue of the donnelly - fefferman bound for the size of the nodal set of laplace eigenfunctions on real - analytic manifolds @xcite .    to illustrate the nodal bounds in theorem [ main ] , consider the steklov eigenfunctions on a unit disk corresponding to the double eigenvalue @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "they can be represented in polar coordinates by @xmath27 for some @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the nodal set of each such eigenfunction is a union of @xmath1 diameters , of total length @xmath29 .",
    "[ swz ] our methods here are specific to the case of real - analytic surfaces . in higher dimensions , steklov eigenfunctions on @xmath0",
    "are much more complicated and their nodal structures are not well - understood . in the case of a general smooth @xmath1-dimensional manifold with smooth boundary , a non - sharp lower bound @xmath30 for the volume @xmath31 of the interior nodal sets has recently been proven in @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as the steklov analogue of the lower bounds on the size of the nodal sets of laplace eigenfunctions obtained in @xcite .    after the first version of the present paper",
    "was posted on the archive , an upper bound of order @xmath32 on the size of the nodal set of steklov eigenfunctions on surfaces was obtained in @xcite using a quite different approach .",
    "while this bound is not sharp , it is valid for arbitrary compact smooth surfaces with boundary .",
    "more recently , while the present paper was under review , the sharp upper bound in theorem [ main ] has been extended in @xcite to real - analytic riemannian manifolds of arbitrary dimension .      for any closed manifold with boundary @xmath0 , steklov eigenfunctions @xmath33 decay rapidly into the interior of @xmath0 @xcite . in order to analyze their nodal lengths",
    ", we must therefore consider a neighborhood of the boundary and its complement separately .",
    "the idea is to use quasimodes near the boundary and frequency function techniques in the interior .",
    "we begin , in section 2 , by constructing quasimodes for the dirichlet - to - neumann operator @xmath9 . in proposition",
    "[ boundary lemma ] , we show that trigonometric functions are approximate eigenfunctions for @xmath9 , up to an exponentially decaying error term .",
    "the proof uses the @xmath34 surface assumption in a very strong way : from @xcite , we conclude that the error term decays faster than any polynomial in @xmath18 , and the assumption of analyticity allows us to improve the decay of the error term to exponential . from proposition [ boundary lemma ] and some fairly standard linear algebra techniques , we show in lemma [ quasimodeapprox ] that the boundary steklov eigenfunctions @xmath35 can be approximated by trigonometric functions @xmath36 plus an error @xmath37 which decays exponentially in @xmath18 in any @xmath38 norm .",
    "we would like to use the quasimode approximation to estimate nodal length of a steklov eigenfunction @xmath33 near the boundary , but from the example of the annulus ( see example [ annulus ] ) , we know that it is possible for @xmath33 to itself be exponentially small near one or more boundary components . indeed , this seems to be the generic situation .",
    "near these  residual \" boundary components , the error in the quasimode approximation can be larger than the quasimode itself and hence the approximation is not particularly useful .",
    "our proof avoids this difficulty via harmonic extension of the steklov eigenfunctions across residual boundary components . by controlling the @xmath38-norm of the extended eigenfunctions ( see lemma [ extension ] ) , one can effectively treat a neighborhood of the  residual \" boundary components in the same way as the interior of @xmath39    to illustrate the proof , consider a steklov eigenfunction @xmath33 on the annular domain @xmath40 in figure  [ fig : mainfig ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is a non - residual , i.e.  dominant \" , boundary component for @xmath33 and that @xmath42 is a residual boundary component . in section 3.2 ,",
    "we extend our boundary quasimode approximation given by lemma [ quasimodeapprox ] into the interior .",
    "the exponential decay of the error means that the approximation is effective in a @xmath18-independent neighborhood of @xmath41 .",
    "a direct comparison of nodal sets ( section 4.2 ) then gives us upper and lower bounds on the nodal length of @xmath33 in a small neighborhood of @xmath41 , denoted by the dotted line in figure [ fig : mainfig ] .",
    "is the annulus between the boundary components @xmath41 and @xmath42 , denoted by solid lines .",
    "the dotted circles mark a neighborhood of @xmath41 in @xmath40 and a neighborhood of @xmath42 in @xmath43 .",
    "the two sets @xmath44 are as illustrated . ]    to treat the interior and a neighborhood of the residual boundary components , we extend @xmath33 ( section 2.4 ) to a small @xmath18-independent neighborhood of @xmath42 , with boundary denoted by the dotted circle . in this neighborhood , @xmath33 is still exponentially small in @xmath18 ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "now let @xmath44 be two sets as in figure [ fig : mainfig ] .",
    "in section 4.4 , we use standard frequency function techniques to bound the nodal length of @xmath33 in @xmath45 from above by the ",
    "renormalized almgren frequency function \" of the larger domain @xmath46 . then , using the quasimode approximation near the boundary and the fact that a portion of @xmath47 coincides with @xmath41 , we bound this frequency function by a multiple of @xmath18 .",
    "a covering argument extends these upper bounds to all of @xmath40 outside a neighborhood of @xmath41 , including a neighborhood of @xmath42 .",
    "combining these upper bounds with the two - sided bounds near @xmath41 completes the proof .",
    "a particularly novel aspect of the problem is the exponential decay into the interior of the eigenfunctions , namely that for some positive constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 depending only on the geometry of @xmath0 , @xmath50 this is an immediate consequence of lemma [ approx ] and the exponential decay of the interior quasimode approximations .",
    "a similar estimate holds for the derivatives of order @xmath51 of @xmath33 , provided we multiply the right - hand side by @xmath52 .",
    "our problem therefore resembles the question of estimating the size of nodal sets in forbidden regions for eigenfunctions of schrdinger operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a different method of proving has been communicated to us by m. taylor @xcite .",
    "it also follows from our results ( see proposition [ cor : eigenvaluedecay ] ) that for real - analytic surfaces , the error term in the eigenvalue approximation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.4 ) in fact decays exponentially as the index of the eigenvalue increases .",
    "in particular , for a simply connected real - analytic surface @xmath0 , there exists a constant @xmath53 depending on the geometry of @xmath0 such that @xmath54 this improves the error estimate @xmath55 obtained independently by rozenblyum and guillemin - melrose ( see @xcite ) for smooth simply connected surfaces .      to illustrate several features of steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunctions used in the proof of theorem [ main ] outlined in section [ sketch ] , consider an annulus @xmath56 with inner radius @xmath57 and outer radius @xmath19 .",
    "first we compare its steklov spectrum to the spectrum of a union of two disks , of radii @xmath19 and @xmath57 , which consists of the double eigenvalue zero , as well as the double eigenvalues @xmath58 and @xmath59 for each @xmath60 .",
    "let us show that the difference between these eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath56 is in fact exponentially vanishing in @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , as computed in @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) ) , the nonzero steklov eigenvalues of the annulus are given by the roots of the quadratic polynomial @xmath61 for each @xmath60 ( each root corresponds to a double eigenvalue ) .",
    "we could compute the eigenvalues directly , but it is easier to compare @xmath62 to the polynomial @xmath63 which has roots @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in fact @xmath64 , where @xmath65 since @xmath66 , a straightforward calculation shows that the roots of @xmath62 differ from @xmath58 and @xmath59 by @xmath67 as well .",
    "the error is exponentially decreasing in @xmath58 , which agrees with the eigenvalue approximation result in proposition [ cor : eigenvaluedecay ] .",
    "steklov eigenfunctions on surfaces also exhibit exponential decay at certain boundary components , which motivates our definition of  dominant \" and  residual \" boundary components ( see definition [ dominant ] ) . to illustrate this , consider an eigenfunction @xmath68 of the annulus @xmath56 corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath69 .",
    "as computed in @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a unit norm linear combination of @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 is an appropriate normalizing constant . since @xmath75",
    ", we see that @xmath76 , that the @xmath77-norm of @xmath68 on @xmath78 is roughly @xmath19 , and that the @xmath77-norm on @xmath79 is @xmath80 - which is exponentially decaying in @xmath58 .",
    "so , in this case , the circle of radius @xmath19 is a dominant boundary component , while the circle of radius @xmath57 is a residual boundary component .",
    "a similar analysis holds for the eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues of the form @xmath81 , with the roles of the boundary components reversed .",

    "we first prove theorem [ main ] in the case where @xmath0 is a real - analytic planar domain and explain the fairly minor modifications needed to treat the general case of compact riemann surfaces with boundary in section [ general ] .",
    "the two - dimensional case is quite special . indeed , unlike the higher - dimensional case , for surfaces the steklov operator @xmath82 agrees with the square root of the laplacian on the various boundary components modulo a smoothing operator . upon reparametrization by arclength ,",
    "the latter operator is consequently ( modulo smoothing ) just the fourier multiplier @xmath83 acting on the component boundary circles .",
    "although not necessary , one can see the former directly by applying conformal mapping .",
    "indeed , by the koebe uniformization theorem @xcite , one can conformally map @xmath0 to a planar domain @xmath40 , where @xmath40 is the disk of radius 1 with a finite number of interior disks removed . in the cases",
    "where @xmath0 is simply - connected , this reduces to the riemann mapping theorem .",
    "when @xmath3 is real - analytic , it follows by @xmath34 regularity up to the boundary in the associated dirichlet problem for the green s function @xcite that the conformal map @xmath84 extends to a real - analytic map of @xmath85 to @xmath86 moreover , @xmath87 maps boundary to boundary in a univalent fashion .",
    "in particular , the induced boundary restriction @xmath88 is a @xmath34-diffeomorphism .",
    "the boundary @xmath89 consists of a union of circles , which we denote by @xmath41 , @xmath90 , with radii @xmath91 and centers @xmath92 respectively .",

    "finally , let @xmath100 and @xmath101 be the measures on @xmath89 and @xmath95 respectively induced by the euclidean measure @xmath102 on @xmath103 .",
    "as in @xcite , the steklov problem in ( [ steklov ] ) is conformally mapped to the problem @xmath104 with @xmath105 analytic for @xmath106 and @xmath107 . by conformal mapping ,",
    "@xmath108 - so without loss of generality , it suffices to work with the conformal model ( [ disc ] ) and we will do so here .",
    "we will abuse notation somewhat and denote the corresponding steklov operator in the conformal model ( [ disc ] ) by @xmath109 as well , and its eigenfunctions by @xmath110 .",
    "we henceforth make the normalization that @xmath111 since we consistently work with the model case in ( [ disc ] ) , this should not lead to confusion .    given @xmath112 we complexify @xmath89 to a grauert tube ( ie .",

    ". then let @xmath731 , so that @xmath732 is the right endpoint of that gap .",
    "choosing @xmath733 as with @xmath734 and iterating this process , we produce @xmath735 .",
    "now let @xmath736;\\ \\mathcal i_i= [ \\mu_{m_i}-{\\varepsilon}/2,\\mu_{n_i}+{\\varepsilon}/2]\\ \\forall\\ , j\\geq 2.\\ ] ] we claim that these intervals satisfy each property we want . indeed , by construction , property ( 2 ) is automatic .",
    "property ( 1 ) follows immediately from the fact that @xmath718 whenever @xmath737 . to see property ( 3 ) , note that each @xmath709 with @xmath708 has length at most @xmath738 , and hence contains at most one element of each arithmetic progression with period @xmath720 .",
    "finally , property ( 4 ) is also immediate by construction ( note that @xmath739 contains @xmath740 ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we now use these intervals to split the sequence @xmath741 into pieces with gaps of size at least @xmath57 between each .",
    "specifically , fix some @xmath57 and let @xmath709 , @xmath742 be the intervals constructed int lemma [ clustering ] . for each @xmath654 , we let @xmath743 be the set of all @xmath96 for which @xmath744 , and we say that @xmath745 since each interval @xmath709 for @xmath708 contains at most @xmath58 eigenvalues @xmath399 ( and each interval , including @xmath709 , contains at least one ) , there exists a universal constant @xmath49 such that @xmath746      let @xmath747 be an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for @xmath83 , with eigenvalues @xmath748 , and note that each @xmath749 is either a trigonometric polynomial with frequency @xmath748 or identically zero . write @xmath750 . by orthonormality and completeness of the eigenbases , we have @xmath751 we claim that if we set @xmath752 where @xmath753 is defined by , then the conditions of the lemma are satisfied . indeed , condition ( 1 ) is obvious , since by the definition of our intervals @xmath709 , the frequency of each @xmath754 with @xmath755 is within @xmath756 of @xmath399 .",
    "it remains to prove ( 2 ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we let @xmath49 and @xmath418 be universal constants ( which may depend on the geometry of @xmath40 and on the conformal map from @xmath40 to @xmath0 ) and re - label at will . from proposition [ boundary lemma ] and the weyl asymptotics , we know that there exists @xmath418 such that @xmath757 . plugging in the first equation in",
    ", we see that @xmath758 and hence that the same is the true of the @xmath77-norm . summing only over the @xmath1 with @xmath759",
    ", we obtain @xmath760 by property ( 2 ) of lemma [ clustering ] , we know @xmath761 whenever @xmath759 , so @xmath762 however , by , for each @xmath96 we have @xmath763 .",
    "so @xmath764 in addition , suppose @xmath765 with @xmath766 .",
    "then , again using and the orthonormality of @xmath767 , as well as cauchy - schwarz , @xmath768    thinking of @xmath769 as an infinite matrix , let @xmath770 be the square submatrix of @xmath490 with @xmath1 and @xmath96 in @xmath743 ; note that by condition ( 3 ) of lemma [ clustering ] @xmath770 is of size at most @xmath771 . we interpret and as saying that the columns of @xmath770 have almost unit length and are almost orthogonal to each other . in particular , for each @xmath654 , we may write @xmath772 . by and",
    ", there exists a constant @xmath418 such that @xmath773 ( the norm @xmath774 denotes the supremum of the entries of @xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , for large enough @xmath654 , @xmath775 is always invertible , with inverse of the form @xmath776 , with @xmath777 as well .",
    "in fact , @xmath778 , so @xmath779 exists and equals @xmath780 .",
    "multiply the equation @xmath781 on the left by @xmath770 and on the right by @xmath779 to yield @xmath782 we see now that @xmath783 has the form @xmath784 , where @xmath785 satisfies @xmath786 ( note that the entries of @xmath770 and @xmath787 are bounded by 1 ) .",
    "this now tells us that the _ rows _ of @xmath770 have almost unit length : i.e. that @xmath788 by subtraction and , there exists @xmath418 such that @xmath789 which is the analogue of , but summing in @xmath96 instead of in @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , it is an immediate consequence of and that if @xmath790 , @xmath791    by the sobolev embedding theorem , for each @xmath792 , we have @xmath793 . we apply this to @xmath380 , knowing that we can compute sobolev norms of the @xmath754 directly : @xmath794 by weyl asymptotics of the @xmath795 , @xmath796 using , then the weyl asymptotics again , we have @xmath797 choosing @xmath48 slightly less than the current @xmath434 , we can absorb @xmath798 and take square roots , completing the proof .    from the discussion before , considering each term individually , we see that for every @xmath1 and @xmath96 , @xmath799 using the matrix notation from the previous proof , let @xmath655 and @xmath800 be the diagonal matrices whose entries are @xmath801 and @xmath802 respectively .",
    "using , implies the statement @xmath803 for sufficiently large @xmath654 , @xmath770 is invertible with inverse uniformly bounded in the @xmath804 matrix norm .",
    "we deduce that @xmath805 so @xmath806 is diagonalized by @xmath770 and has eigenvalues @xmath807 . by the bauer - fike theorem ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "although the perturbed eigenvalues may move from one disk to another if there is overlap , there are at most @xmath58 disks , so they can move at most @xmath810 .",
