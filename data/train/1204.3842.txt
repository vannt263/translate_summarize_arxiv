    "in fact , by the residue theorem , we get @xmath271    therefore , the polynomial recurrence relation ( [ polirek ] ) is equivalent to a polynomial recurrence relation for the numbers @xmath228 . in order to obtain this recurrence relation , we need to solve a large system of linear equations .",

    "recurrence relation ( [ recdiagz ] ) is much more useful than the explicit formula that we found for @xmath274 in ( [ diagz ] ) .",
    "indeed , the _ exponential _ growth rate of @xmath274 is easy to read off from ( [ recdiagz ] ) .",
    "it is routine to prove that @xmath310{a_n } = 13.5 .\\ ] ]    determining the growth rate of @xmath274 at a higher level of precision is much more difficult .",

    "there are reasonable alternatives to the edge gluing rule for defining an assembly tree .",
    "two possibilities are the following .",
    "for each of these two rules , the problem is again to enumeratate the number of assembly trees for interesting graphs .",
    "an assembly tree for a connected graph @xmath0 using the _ connected gluing rule _ is an assembly tree for @xmath0 ( satisfying properties ( 1 - 4 ) in section  [ secintro ] ) , and also satisfying the additional property :      this rule is less restrictive than the edge gluling rule . in particular ,",
    "an assembly tree of a graph @xmath0 is not necessarily a binary tree . at the extreme",
    "is the assembly tree of depth @xmath61 for which every vertex of @xmath0 is a child of the root .    in this definition , we denote each face of a plane graph by the set of vertices on that face .",
    "an assembly tree for a connected plane graph @xmath0 using the _ face gluing rule _ is an assembly tree for @xmath0 satisfying the additional property .",
    "all the graphs in sections  [ secpathcycle ] and [ sech - partite ] for which we were able to compute the number of assembly trees share a common property : the number of connected induced subgraphs , up to unlabeled isomorphism type , is small . for example , the number of connected induced subgraphs of the path @xmath68 is @xmath5 . for the complete graph @xmath127 ,",
    "it is @xmath5 , and for the complete bipartite graph @xmath330 it is @xmath331 .",
    "with @xmath1 fixed , the number of connected induced subgraphs of any @xmath1-graph is again polynomial in the parameters @xmath332 . for results on graphs with few isomorphism types of induced subgraphs",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so the question arises : is it possible to enumerate the number of assembly trees ( by the edge gluing rule ) for a family of graphs for which the number of isomorhism types of induced subgraphs is not small .",
    "in particular , consider the family of caterpillar graphs @xmath333 on @xmath334 vertices as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the number of isomorphism types of linduced subgraphs is clearly large , exponential in @xmath5 .",
    "we are indebted to doron zeilberger , who has made us aware of his results in @xcite , and has patiently explained his method to us .",
