    "in this work we will study a pauli hamiltonian describing the interaction of a neutral spin-@xmath0 particle interacting with a magnetic field generated by an electric current - carrying straight wire .",
    "this system was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was analyzed in the momentum space . here",
    ", we will carry out a systematic study in the configuration space based on the techniques of supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite , sometimes referred to as the factorization method @xcite , a technique that has been already used to study spin-@xmath0 pauli equations ( for different approaches , see for example @xcite ) .    to motivate the specific form of the pauli hamiltonian for the present work",
    ", we will start with the formulation of its symmetry properties .",
    "we will see later that this additional information is also closely related to the factorization method .",
    "thus , let us consider the pauli hamiltonian in the three - dimensional space [ haminitial ] h_3 = + * * ( * x * ) + v(*x * ) where @xmath1 is a magnetic field , @xmath2 is the magnetic moment of the particle , @xmath3 is a scalar potential , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the pauli matrices , that is , [ paulimatrices ] _ 0= (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & 1    ) _ 1= (    cc 0 & 1 + 1&0    ) _ 2= (    cc 0 & - i + i & 0    ) _ 3= (    cc 1 & 0 + 0&-1    ) .",
    "we take the usual notation for the cartesian coordinates @xmath6 and the momentum operators @xmath7 .",
    "now , we will impose some symmetries on this hamiltonian in order to obtain the precise example we want to consider in this work .",
    "we assume that the current - carrying wire is placed on the @xmath8-axis , and we look for the systems ( [ haminitial ] ) allowing for first order symmetries of the form [ pj3 ] p_3= p_3 + a(*x * ) _ 3= x_1 p_2-",
    "x_2 p_1 + b(*x * ) l_3 + b(*x * ) where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are hermitian matrix - valued functions to be determined . by imposing that @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are symmetries of @xmath13 , that is , @xmath14=[{\\cal p}_3,{\\cal h}_3]=0 $ ] , we are led to the following explicit expressions ( up to an equivalence ) : & & j_3 = -i _ + _ 3 _",
    "3= -i_x_3 + & & * b*(*x * ) = ( f ( ) , f ( ) , g ( ) ) + & & v(*x * ) = v ( ) where @xmath15 are cylindrical coordinates , the functions @xmath16 are arbitrary , and @xmath17 are free parameters .",
    "therefore , we can decouple the problem as follows : a free motion in the @xmath8axis and another motion in the plane @xmath18 . in the sequel",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the analysis of the system in the plane , with hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "next , we will also assume that there exists a second order symmetry of parabolic type , that is , with a leading second order term associated to parabolic coordinates @xcite , _",
    "1= l_3 p_1 + p_1 l_3 + * a*(*x * ) + * p*(*x * ) + n(*x * ) where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are matrix - valued vector and scalar hermitian functions , respectively .",
    "if the magnetic term determined by @xmath22 is present , we arrive , up to an equivalence , to the same model already reported in @xcite : & & [ b ] * b*(*x * ) = ( x_2/^2 , -x_1/^2 , 0 ) v(*x * ) = 0 + & & [ j3 ] j_3 = -i _ + 2 _ 3 l_3 + 2 _ 3 + & & [ se1 ] s_1= j_3 p_1 + p_1 j_3 - x_2 ( * x * ) .",
    "the commutator of @xmath11 and @xmath23 gives another second order symmetry @xmath24 : [ se2 ] s_2= j_3 p_2 + p_2 j_3 + x_1 ( * x * ) .",
    "all these symmetries , together with the hamiltonian @xmath25 , close the following quadratic algebra : [ commutjs ] [ j_3,s_1 ] = i s_2= - i s_1= -4 i h_2 j_3 .",
    "as it was mentioned in @xcite , the symmetries @xmath26 are similar to the components of the laplace - runge - lenz vector for the coulomb potential .",
    "previous works have considered the quantum mechanical problem that we are dealing in this paper , mainly in the momentum space @xcite , but also paying attention to some partial aspects in the configuration space @xcite . in the present work",
    "we want to address it from a self - contained , systematic and more complete point of view , including important properties not considered before .",
    "basically , we will use the susy quantum mechanics approach with special emphasis on the shape - invariance of the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will perform the separation of variables and we will obtain the discrete symmetries that are basic in the development of the following sections .",
    "next , in section 3 we analyze the factorization and the shape - invariance properties of the radial equation .",
    "we study the ground states by means of this factorization in section 4 , and the excited states in section 5 . in section 6",
    ", we will study the relationship between the second - order symmetries and the intertwining operators entering the factorization . in section 7",
    "we build the matrix ladder operators connecting eigenstates with different energies of the same hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in section 8 we conclude this work with some remarks , stressing the most original results obtained in this paper .",
    "let us consider again the two - dimensional matrix hamiltonian @xmath25 obtained from ( [ haminitial ] ) , where we have excluded the free part along the @xmath8-axis , and where the interaction is given by the magnetic field ( [ b ] ) , thus , sharing the symmetries ( [ j3])([commutjs ] ) .",
    "in order to simplify the expressions , we take [ hbar=1 ] = 2m=1 x= x_1y= x_2 r= so that we will work with the following form of the hamiltonian [ 2dmodel ] h = h_2/^2= -(_x^2 + _ y^2 ) + _ 1 - _ 2 where the second order symmetries are [ secondordsym ] t_j = ^-1 s_j j=1,2 .      since this hamiltonian commutes with the operator @xmath11 given in ( [ j3 ] ) , we can look for their common eigenfunctions [ eigen ] h_ = e__3_ =  _  _ = (    c_1 + _ 2    ) . the rotational symmetry can be used to separate variables in polar coordinates @xmath27 so that the @xmath11-eigenfunctions in ( [ eigen ] ) are given by [ 23 ] _ (r,)= y_ ( ) f_(r ) with [ 23a ] y_ ( ) =(    cc e^i(-1/2 ) & 0 + 0 & e^i(+1/2 )    ) f_(r)= (    cf_1(r ) + f_2(r )    ) .",
    "now , taking into account the polar expression for the laplacian @xmath28 , the eigenfunction equation for @xmath29 takes the form -f_(r)-1r f_(r ) + f_(r ) - _ 3 f_(r ) - _ 2 f_(r ) = e f_(r ) . in order to eliminate the first order derivative term",
    ", we make the replacement [ ff ] f_(r ) = r^-1/2 _ (r ) so that we finally have a one - dimensional matrix schrdinger - like equation [ pauli ] h__(r ) \\ { -+ - } _",
    "(r ) = e_(r ) where we have introduced the notation @xmath30 for the radial part of the initial hamiltonian @xmath31 . notice that this equation is quite similar to the radial schrdinger equation for a charged particle in a coulomb potential [ coulomb ] h_^c(r ) -(r)+ ( r ) - ( r ) = e^c(r ) where @xmath32 is the orbital momentum .",
    "the discrete spectrum is given by the well known formula [ cspectrum ] e^c = -14(+n+1)^2 n=0,1 ,       in the following we will describe some discrete symmetries of the matrix equation ( [ pauli ] ) .",
    "let us consider the antilinear operator = _ 3 k where @xmath33 is the complex conjugation operator , @xmath34 .",
    "then , it is immediate to check that this is a symmetry of @xmath30 : _  c = c h_ .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath35 , up to a global phase factor , are of the form : [ conjugation ] = (    c_1(r ) + i _",
    "2(r )    ) where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real functions .",
    "hence , from now on , we will choose the eigenfunctions of the matrix equation ( [ pauli ] ) in the form ( [ conjugation ] ) .",
    "it is very easy to see from ( [ pauli ] ) that [ s22 ] _ 2 h_ = h_- _ 2 .",
    "this means that the eigenfunction problem for @xmath30 is equivalent to that of @xmath39 : _  _  = e _  _ - _ - = e _ - _ - = _ 2 _  . observe that these two discrete symmetries can be implemented also in the space of eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional equations ( [ eigen ] ) . if we want to compare these discrete symmetries with the ones of the coulomb hamiltonian @xmath40 of ( [ coulomb ] ) , we see that the conjugation is translated into the real character of the eigenfunctions , while the reflection property means that @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we will investigate the factorization and the supersymmetrical properties of ( [ pauli ] ) , the radial part of pauli equation .",
    "this one - dimensional @xmath42 matrix problem is interesting by itself , for an arbitrary value of @xmath43 , but especially for the two - dimensional physical model ( [ 2dmodel ] ) with @xmath44 . in particular",
    ", we will see that this matrix model obeys the shape - invariance properties .",
    "this is very interesting because , up to now , the shape - invariance was used as a very elegant algebraic approach in the solution of one and two - dimensional scalar spectral problems @xcite , while in this section it will be used to determine the spectrum of a one - dimensional matrix example .",
    "following closely the well known factorization of the coulomb hamiltonian ( [ coulomb ] ) , we propose here the following ansatz for this matrix case : [ not1 ] h_ = ( + + d _ 2 ) ( - + + d _ 2 ) + where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are real constants to be determined .",
    "indeed , we find two different solutions having the following form [ not ] h_ = l^-_l^+_+ _  = l^+_-1l^-_-1 + _ -1 _  = where we have used the following notation for the operators [ not3 ] l^_= + - + w_(r ) being @xmath47 the matrix superpotentials .    of course , equations ( [ not1])([not3 ] ) are valid for any value of @xmath48 , and therefore we can build a hierarchy of hamiltonians @xmath49 , @xmath50 , as follows : [ recurrence ] h_+m = l^-_+ml^+_+m+ _ +m = l^+_+m-1l^-_+m-1 + _ +m-1 .",
    "these relations allow to define an algebra of operators of the hamiltonian hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath51 act as intertwining operators between two consecutive hamiltonians @xmath52 and @xmath53 : [ intert ] l^+_+mh_+m = h_+m+1l^+_+mh_+ml^-_+m = l^-_+m h_+m+1 . these relations imply that the eigenfunctions of @xmath52 can be obtained from those of @xmath53 with the same eigenvalue by acting with @xmath54 , while the operator @xmath55 makes this connection in the opposite way .",
    "this correspondence between square - integrable eigenfunctions is one - to - one , except when @xmath51 annihilates some eigenfunctions . as usual ,",
    "relations ( [ recurrence ] ) and ( [ intert ] ) mean that the hamiltonians of the hierarchy @xmath49 are shape - invariant : intertwined hamiltonians have the same shape but different values of the parameter .",
    "now , let us see the effect of the discrete symmetries @xmath35 and @xmath56 on the intertwining operators .",
    "it is easy to check that [ c ] c l^_+m= l^_+m c and [ ss2 ] _ 2 l^+_+m = l^-_- - m-1 _ 2 . from the commutation ( [ c ] )",
    "we see that the interwining operators keep the form of the eigenfunctions @xmath57 in ( [ conjugation ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ ss2 ] ) will have consequences for the ground states , as we will see in the next section .",

    "although the initial two - dimensional model ( [ 2dmodel ] ) is related to the hierarchy with half - integer values of @xmath38 , we will analyze the properties for any @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we can distinguish the following three classes of hierarchies .",
    "* @xmath61 .",
    "we call it the _ ` integer hierarchy ' _ @xmath62 , @xmath50 .",
    "it includes the hamiltonian @xmath63 and would correspond to two - valued eigenfunctions in the context of the two - dimensional problem ( [ 2dmodel ] ) .",
    "the reflection in @xmath38 is implemented in the hierarchy , a scheme of which can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "* @xmath64 .",
    "we refer to this case as the _ ` physical hierarchy ' _ @xmath65 , @xmath66 , because it is associated to the physical spin-@xmath0 systems of eq .",
    "( [ 2dmodel ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is the only case considered in all the previous references @xcite , and for it the operators @xmath67 are not well defined , as can be seen from ( [ not3 ] ) . therefore , there are no first - order intertwining operators connecting the hamiltonians @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "remark that the hierarchy also includes the reflection in @xmath38 .",
    "* @xmath70 .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ ` general hierarchy ' _ @xmath49 .",
    "it does not implement the reflection in @xmath38 ; in fact this reflection gives rise to the hierarchies with values @xmath71 .",
    "the associated two - dimensional eigenfunctions are multiple - valued .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ground states of susy - hierarchy hamiltonians are the main elements when using the shape - invariance approach in the construction of the whole spectra and the eigenfunctions for one - dimensional scalar problems . in this section",
    ", the explicit expressions for the ground states of the matrix susy - hierachies described in the previous section will be found and analyzed .",
    "let us start with the ground - state wave - functions @xmath72 annihilated by the general intertwining operator @xmath55 : [ ground ] l^+_+m_+m^0=0 . then , according to ( [ not ] ) and ( [ recurrence ] ) , this will be an eigenfunction of @xmath73 with energy @xmath74 : _ +m _",

    "j , ^0(r ) = z^1++m_j(z)j=1,2 z = in equation ( [ ground ] ) .",

    "1(z)=0 with general solution _",
    "1(z ) = c_1 i_1(z ) + c_2 k_1(z ) where @xmath76 are the two linearly independent modified bessel functions . after a simple calculation",

    "thus , the physical solution will be @xmath85 , which is a well behaved ground state of @xmath52 with @xmath86 ( the ground state of @xmath87 will be considered later ) .",

    "[ secondtilde ] as in the previous case , a study of the asymptotic behaviour shows that the square - integrable and finite ground states are obtained by taking @xmath93 in ( [ secondtilde ] ) , whenever @xmath94 .",
    "the results for this case could be found directly from the previous one with the help of the relation ( [ ss2 ] ) between both types of intertwining operators through @xmath56 .    in summary , we have one reasonable ground state for each hamiltonian @xmath52 : if @xmath86 it is of the form @xmath95 , while if @xmath89 it will take the form @xmath96 .",
    "there is only one hamiltonian , @xmath63 , having a doubly degenerated square - integrable solution with energy @xmath97 . but",
    "this case is rather special and we will comment on its lack of physical meaning later on .    to end this section ,",

    "first of all , let us recall that [ ki ] l^+_+mk_+m(r)=l^+_+mi_+m(r)=0 .",
    "let us introduce now the @xmath98 matrix @xmath99 , whose columns are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , in this order .",
    "then , equations ( [ ki ] ) can be expressed in a more compact form : l^+_+mm_+m(r)=-m_+m(r)+ w_+m(r)m_+m(r)=0 .",
    "thus , after substituting ( [ kilm ] ) , we get again the expression of ( [ not3 ] ) for the matrix superpotential in terms of the solution matrix : [ w ] w_+m(r)=m_+m(r ) m^-1_+m(r)= - .",
    "therefore , we have shown that this class of matrix solutions @xmath99 gives rise in a nontrivial way to a hermitian matrix superpotential .",
    "it is important to stress that there are not many explicit examples satisfying this condition @xcite .",
    "in this section we will study the excited states of the system ( [ pauli ] ) .",
    "there are some general expressions valid for any hierarchy . in order to find the @xmath102-excited state @xmath103 of a particular hamiltonian @xmath30 , @xmath104",

    "two natural questions arise now :    * are the excited states obtained in this way always square - integrable ? * are these excited states the only bounded physical states for each hamiltonian of the hierarchy ?    here , in the context of the factorization method , we can answer to the first question : under the assumption @xmath104 , all the eigenfunctions build in the form ( [ exc ] ) are finite , square - integrable and vanishing at the endpoints ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) , so they indeed describe excited bound states .",
    "the details are given in the appendix .",
    "with respect to the second question , as in the two - dimensional scalar models @xcite , it should be studied from the point of view of a general  oscillation theorem \" for matrix sturm - liouville operators to guarantee that no additional excited states exists besides those obtained after applying the shape - invariance procedure ( for a discussion on two - dimensional scalar models see @xcite ) .",
