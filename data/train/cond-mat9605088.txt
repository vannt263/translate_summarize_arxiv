    "the nonlinear @xmath0-model is an ubiquitous model that can describe systems ranging from quantum spins@xcite to disordered electronic systems@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall discuss this model with @xmath1 symmetry . a particularly attractive method to solve this model",
    "is the @xmath8-expansion@xcite , where the spatial dimensionality , @xmath9 , defines @xmath10 . in this method , one takes advantage of the proximity of the non - trivial fixed point to the zero temperature fixed point in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "one then expands around the zero temperature fixed point to obtain information about the non - trivial fixed point .",
    "such arguments are clearly powerful , especially because there are not many explicit analytical techniques to solve this model .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine this method more critically .",
    "we begin by showing that , in the most natural definition of the problem , one must examine the role of gradient operators of degree higher than two , although , by power - counting , the higher order gradient terms are irrelevant . the task of this paper is to show that when fluctuations are taken into account , the higher order gradient operators become relevant , more so as the number of gradients increases .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the fixed point is infinitely unstable , and the method fails .",
    "this surprising result was first discovered in a related model in the context of anderson localization of an electron in a random potential@xcite .",
    "however , we believe that this phenomenon in the @xmath1-model actually reflects the failure of the perturbative analysis , that is of the @xmath8-expansion . to appreciate this conclusion , consider the @xmath12 heisenberg model for which much is known from high temperature series expansion , accurate monte - carlo calculations , and from the @xmath13-expansion of the @xmath14 field theory . none of these methods give any hint of any pathological behavior .",
    "indeed , kehrein , wegner and pismak have shown that in the @xmath2-component @xmath15 model the one - loop contributions always make the canonically irrelevant operators even more irrelevant@xcite .",
    "thus , it is very likely that it is necessary to take into account non - perturbative effects if one wants to describe this phase transition within the context of the non - linear @xmath0-model . at the very least",
    ", the results obtained from this expansion should be taken with some caution , especially in those cases in which there are not many independent checks .    to one - loop order",
    ", the anomalous dimensions of the high gradient operators of the @xmath1 model were first calculated by wegner@xcite . in an earlier paper@xcite",
    ", we briefly reported the corresponding two - loop results , and we showed that the relevance of the high - gradient operators persists to two - loop order .",
    "since the method and the unexpected results may not be familiar , we have decided to give a full account in the present paper .",
    "we also analyze the renormalization group equations , and we discuss the physical consequences of the renormalization group flows .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the high gradient operators , and , in sec .",
    "iii , we set up the background field method . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the one - loop correction to the anomalous dimension to illustrate the efficacy of the background field method . in sec .",
    "v , we present the two - loop calculation . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss the flows of the renormalization group equations . sec .",
    "vii contains our conclusions , and there are four appendices .",
    "it is useful to begin with a soft - spin model because , in many instances , the non - linear @xmath0-model arises from a microscopic situation in which both the direction and the magnitude of the order parameter field is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "one then argues that as long as the @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken , the interactions between the goldstone modes are precisely those given by the non - linear @xmath0-model@xcite . to be specific",
    "let us consider the @xmath1-invariant @xmath16 field theory and explore how the high gradient operators arise .",
    "for this field theory , the action is given by @xmath17=\\int d^dx\\left[{1\\over 2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu}{\\bf \\phi})^2+{1\\over 2 } r{\\bf \\phi}^2+u({\\bf \\phi}^2)^2\\right].\\ ] ] below the mean field transition , set @xmath18 and separate out the direction , @xmath19 , of the order parameter field @xmath20 from its magnitude @xmath21 . if we write @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mean field value of the magnitude of the order parameter , not containing any loop corrections , _",
    "i.e. _ , fluctuations . then @xmath17=\\int   d^dx\\left\\{{1\\over 2}(m+\\delta \\rho(x))^2\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}{\\bf s}\\right)^2+{1\\over 2}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu } { \\delta\\rho}\\right)^2+{1\\over 2 } r(m + \\delta \\rho(x))^2+u(m + \\delta \\rho(x))^4\\right\\}\\ ] ] in principle , we can integrate out the fluctuations of the magnitude of the order parameter , @xmath24 . because @xmath21 is a massive field ,",
    "the effective action is local on scales larger than the inverse mass .",
    "it is now clear that , for scales larger than the inverse mass or the correlation length , the effective action will involve gradient operators to infinite order in a functional taylor expansion . from symmetry , and from the locality of the action on scales larger than the correlation length associated with the fluctuations of the magnitude of the order parameter field , we find that the effective action can be cast in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the coupling constants ; we are measuring the temperature @xmath27 in units of the bare spin stiffness constant .    from power - counting , the gradient terms with powers larger than 2 are irrelevant and are usually dropped . if @xmath28 , for @xmath29 , denotes the coupling constant associated with the operator @xmath30 , the full scaling dimension , @xmath31 , of @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 ; the dimension @xmath35 is @xmath6 , plus loop corrections .",
    "hence , if we ignore the loop corrections , the contribution of the operator @xmath30 vanishes as @xmath36 as the momentum cutoff in the theory @xmath37 , for small @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , the second gradient term is relevant for @xmath38 and marginal for @xmath39 .",
    "the neglect of the higher order derivative terms leads to the usual partition function of the the nonlinear sigma model : @xmath40 this is also the nave continuum limit of the lattice heisenberg model for which the hamiltonian is @xmath41 where the temperature is measured in units of the bare spin stiffness constant .",
    "there are well - known arguments that the lattice heisenberg model is in the same universality class as the @xmath2-component @xmath16 field theory .",
    "therefore , all three models , the nonliner @xmath0-model , the @xmath2-component @xmath16 field theory , and the lattice heisenberg model of @xmath2-component unit vector spins should belong to the same universality class , sharing the same long - distance and critical properties .    however , power counting does not necessarily determine the effect of the operators .",
    "one must examine how loop corrections , or fluctuations , affect the picture .",
    "for the non - linear @xmath0 model , it may appear unlikely that the corrections to the dimensions of the high derivative terms coming from fluctuations can overcome the canonical dimension .",
    "however , we shall show that , for large @xmath5 , not only the one - loop correction to the canonical dimension is sufficiently large to render the full dimension positive , but the two loop correction is even larger .",
    "so , to two - loop order , the operators @xmath42 are relevant , contrary to the common description of the non - linear @xmath0-model .",
    "the present calculation is nearly impossible without an efficient method . in this section ,",
    "we discuss a formalism that is efficient . the first step is to express the action as an invariant in the space of cosets @xmath43@xcite .",
    "the length on this manifold is @xmath44 , but because @xmath45 , we can eliminate @xmath0 using @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the line element is @xmath47 where the metric , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 there is no unique way of choosing coordinates on this manifold .",
    "the set @xmath50 and the set @xmath51 will produce two different metrics , but they are related by the transformation equation @xmath52 the action in eq .",
    "( [ partition ] ) can now be written as @xmath53 similarly , the high derivative operators can be written as @xmath54 clearly , the high derivative operators and the action in eq .",
    "( [ partition ] ) are invariant under the reparametrizations of the sphere , since @xmath55 transforms as a vector under reparametrization .",
    "the invariant measure is @xmath56=\\prod_i\\prod_x\\sqrt{g(\\pi)}d\\pi^i(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "we briefly recall the background field method@xcite .",
    "the strength of this method is that covariant expressions can be handled easily and the explicit covariance can be maintained at each step of the calculation .",
    "this turns to be important for an efficient organization of the calculations to be described .",
    "there is another important reason for using this method .",
    "when the fluctuations around the background field are integrated out , operators arise that are not invariant under the reparametrizations of the sphere .",
    "one obtains operators that are proportional to the classical equation of motion @xmath58 where @xmath59 \\label{connect}\\ ] ] are the christoffel symbols . since @xmath60 does not transform as a tensor , the equation of motion is not invariant , and the operators proportional to the equation of motion are not invariant quantities .",
    "these are the redundant operators@xcite that do not affect the critical properties and can be removed by the reparametrizations of the sphere .",
    "let us consider the shift @xmath61 in the partition function . here",
    "@xmath62 is a smooth function , and @xmath63 is an infinitesimal parameter .",
    "then , the redundant operator , @xmath64 , is @xmath65 the first term comes from the action and the second from the measure . as stated above , the redundant operators can be removed by a reparametrization .",
    "we adopt dimensional regularization and the minimal subtraction scheme for the calculation of the renormalization constants . in the dimensional regularization scheme ,",
    "the contribution of the measure term can be set to zero , and the redundant operators disappear if the equation of motion is satisfied , which is an advantage of using the background field method .",
    "the anomalous dimension of a composite operator @xmath66 is computed by computing the divergences created by the insertion in the correlation function , defined by @xmath67 the divergence of the correlation function is not only proportional to the inserted opeartor , but it is usually a linear combination of a number of other operators that are said to mix with the inserted opeartor . the renormalized operator @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the renormalization constants .",
    "the renormalized correlation function @xmath71 in the momentum space is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the bare coupling , the temperature @xmath27 , and @xmath74 is the wave function renormalization of the field .",
    "this leads to the renormalization group equation @xmath75 \\gamma^{(n)}_{o_j , r}(q , p_i , g,\\mu)=0.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath76 is the anomalous dimension of the field , and @xmath77 is the anomalous dimension ( matrix ) corresponding to the operator @xmath78 , and it is defined by @xmath79 where the derivative is computed with fixed bare couplings .",

    "the quantities @xmath84 are the eigenvalues associated with the eigenoperators @xmath83 , and @xmath85 is the anomalous dimension of the field @xmath86 .",
    "the solution of this equation leads to the behavior @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the usual dimension of the correlation function without the operator insertion , and @xmath89 is given by @xmath90-\\gamma_{\\alpha}(g^*)\\label{yalpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 $ ] is the engineering dimension of the operator @xmath83 .",
