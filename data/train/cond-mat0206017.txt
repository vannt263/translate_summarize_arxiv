    "the potts model @xcite is not only fascinating in relation to phase transitions but also an excellent model for constructing new algorithms for monte carlo simulation . before the advent of cluster algorithms , sweeny @xcite in 1983 already had an algorithm that has much reduced critical slowing down .",
    "sweeny algorithm is a heat - bath algorithm in the fortuin - kasteleyn representation @xcite of the potts model as a percolation problem for any positive real value of the number of potts state @xmath0 .",
    "any thermodynamic averages in the potts model representation can be translated into a percolation bond representation @xcite .",
    "sweeny algorithm can be efficiently implemented only in two dimensions . in three and higher dimensions",
    ", it becomes too expensive to simulate , because each move requires a step to identify if two sites belong to the same or different clusters .",
    "nevertheless , it is perhaps the only algorithm that works for any real values of @xmath0 .",
    "very recently , gliozzi @xcite introduced a set of different transition probabilities than that of sweeny s . in gliozzi s rate ,",
    "those links that are occupied by bonds or pair of unoccupied sites that connect the same cluster are resampled with probability @xmath1 for occupation , and @xmath2 for empty .",
    "for unoccupied sites that belong to two different clusters , the probability for occupation by a bond is @xmath3 and empty @xmath4 .",
    "the resampling of a large fraction of the links appears to decorrelate the configuration efficiently .",
    "gliozzi claims @xcite that his algorithm does not suffer from critical slowing down .",
    "we have shown by explicit calculation of the correlation times that this is not true @xcite . in two dimensions , we have good logarithmic divergence of the correlation time with system linear sizes for the ising model . for two - dimensional three - state potts model",
    ", we found dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 , and for the three - dimensional ising model , the exponent is about 0.4 .",
    "the swendsen - wang @xcite and wolff @xcite algorithms work only for integer values of @xmath0 .",
    "they can be implemented very efficiently .",
    "for the swendsen - wang algorithm , each sweep takes cpu time of @xmath6 , and for wolff algorithm , it is proportional to the size of the cluster that is being flipped . they reduce but not completely eliminate critical slowing down at the critical temperature .",
    "the traditional methods mentioned above simulate at one fixed temperature @xmath7 , thus the results are in terms of discrete points .",
    "a curve is obtained by connecting these points .",
    "the transition matrix monte carlo @xcite and other related algorithms @xcite generate continuous function of temperature or other variable from a single simulation , thus greatly enhanced efficiency . the multi - histogram sampling of weigel et al @xcite in the context of @xmath0-state potts model should be mentioned here .",
    "the multicanonical simulation method of berg @xcite also has the additional advantage of much reduced correlation times for first - order phase transitions .",
    "it is very attractive to have algorithms that do not have correlation at all .",
    "in fact , there are such algorithms , such as that of random percolation .",
    "since the samples are drawn at random for each configuration , each configuration is independent of the previous configurations .",
    "the simple sampling method of hu @xcite has this property .",
    "newman and ziff @xcite gave an efficient implement that work by exact weighting of the probability @xmath1 so that after the simulation , the whole curve @xmath8 of some physical observable versus @xmath1 can be computed . in this paper , we present some attempts @xcite that generalize newman - ziff method to general potts model of @xmath0 states . these algorithms all have the common feature that bonds are added to the system one by one .",
    "once there are on the lattice , they do not move .",
    "it is a nonequilibrium process in the sense that there is no ( monte carlo ) time translation invariance for the process .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we briefly review the newman - ziff method , followed by generalization of the partition function to potts model .",
    "we then discuss a number of algorithms , and show their efficiencies and also point out their shortcomings .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "consider the simple bond percolation problem .",
    "we generate configurations by putting bonds at every nearest neighbor link of a @xmath9-dimensional hypercubic lattice with probability @xmath1 , and absence of bond with probability @xmath2 .",
    "any average of physical quantity @xmath10 of configuration @xmath11 can be computed exactly from @xmath12 where the summation is over all the @xmath13 configurations ; @xmath14 is number of bonds present , and @xmath15 is maximum possible number of bonds .    in a standard simulation ,",
    "one fixes a value of @xmath1 , and generates configurations by visiting each link and putting a bond with probability @xmath1 .",
    "estimates of @xmath16 are obtained by taking sample means of quantity @xmath10 .",
    "newman and ziff @xcite instead considered a computation of @xmath17 for each value of @xmath14 , and then reconstructed from @xmath17 the function @xmath18 of @xmath1 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we have @xmath19 where @xmath17 is defined as average over all the @xmath20 configurations @xmath21 of exactly @xmath14 number of bonds , @xmath22    newman and ziff proposed the following algorithm to evaluate @xmath17 .",
    "each sweep of the lattice starts with empty lattice , putting bonds one by one at random over these that is empty .",
    "this will generate @xmath23 configurations with 0 , 1 , @xmath24 , @xmath14 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 number of bonds . from them , we calculate @xmath17 for each @xmath14 . with the help of hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite , the whole calculation of one sweep can be done in cpu time of @xmath6 .",
    "although configurations within a sweep are highly correlated , each sweep is an independent one .",
    "very accurate percolation threshold was obtained this way .    to generalize this procedure to potts model",
    ", we note that the analogous equation to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of clusters of the configuration @xmath11 , and @xmath28 the probability @xmath1 is related to temperature @xmath7 by @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , @xmath31 is no longer known exactly , we must compute by monte carlo simulation ; the quantity @xmath17 is now an average over the configurations of a given number of bonds @xmath14 distributed not uniformly but according to @xmath32 .",
    "this makes the simulation much harder .",
    "the following algorithm , although very inefficient , generates correct probability distribution for the samples , and introduces the way @xmath31 and in general any @xmath17 can be computed .",
    "starting with an empty lattice , one sweep consists of repeated application of the following steps until the process dies :    1 .",
    "pick an unoccupied neighbor pair at random for the next bond .",
    "2 .   if inserting a bond 1 .   does not change the cluster number ( @xmath33 ) , accept the configuration ; 2 .",
    "merge two clusters , so that the cluster number decreases by 1 , ( @xmath34 ) , accept the configuration with probability @xmath35 , or reject the configuration and terminate the process ( and begin the next sweep from an empty lattice ) .",
    "3 .   take statistics of the survival configurations ( with equal weights ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the process at @xmath14 number of bonds is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "the configurations that have equal number of clusters from @xmath14 to @xmath37 bonds have the same probability , but these that merge clusters appear with a probability smaller by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the cumulative effect gives the desired probability distribution .",
    "unfortunately , since the number of samples is exponentially small for large @xmath14 , the algorithm is of only conceptual use .",
    "the number @xmath31 can be related to sample average of the conditional survival probability .",
    "let @xmath38 be the number of empty links that connect same cluster , and @xmath39 be the number of empty links that are on different clusters .",
    "then the conditional survival probability is @xcite @xmath40      to speed up the simulation , we prevent the process from dying , but the price we have to pay is that we need to give weight to samples . specifically , we follow the method of @xmath41-fold way : we choose a type-0 class with probability @xmath42 or type-1 class with probability @xmath43 . once we have decided the class , we pick an empty link from among @xmath38 bonds ( for type-0 class ) or among @xmath39 bonds ( for type-1 class ) at random .",
    "the probability distribution of such a process is not exactly what we wanted , but rather it is @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the number of clusters of the empty lattice . to compute the desired average we must weight with @xmath47 , @xmath48 due to fluctuations in the weights , inefficiencies are unavoidable .",
    "in fact , the above method can give realizable results only for small sizes of order 10 .      to overcome the above problem",
    ", we propose the following method @xcite named binary tree summation monte carlo . for each sweep ,",
    "the algorithm consists of two parts : the simulation part and summation part . in the simulation part",
    ", we always pick a type-1 link ( unoccupied link that bridges two clusters ) at random , thus always merge clusters in each step .",
    "the probability distribution of the configuration sequence generated is @xmath49 in the summation part , we consider all possible ways of inserting type-0 bonds in between each merge step of simulated configurations .",
    "the configurations are weighted in such a way to realize the desired probability distribution , @xmath50 .",
    "specifically , the weight of a configuration which is specified by number of bonds @xmath14 and sequence number in the simulation @xmath51 , is the product of factor @xmath52 ( for each merge step ) and @xmath38 ( for each insertion of type-0 bond that does not merge clusters ) .",
    "this weight @xmath53 can be computed recursively for all @xmath14 and @xmath51 with computer time of @xmath54 , by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with the starting condition @xmath58 and the constraint @xmath59 .",
    "the value @xmath53 is nonzero only for @xmath60 .",
    "the computation of the weights @xmath53 is similar to a recursive computation of the binomial coefficients .",
    "the final statistics of a quantity @xmath8 can be computed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the quantity at the @xmath51-th cluster merge step .",
    "the ratio @xmath64 can be computed from the expectation value of @xmath65 .",
    "note that the number of states @xmath0 enters into the simulate only through the weights and is not used in sampling , we can use any real or complex value for @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , if we collect appropriate histogram ( of @xmath54 entries ) , we can reconstruct the equilibrium average for any @xmath1 and @xmath0 through a single simulation .",
    "the details of the algorithm and some applications will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .     with @xmath66 monte carlo sweeps . ]     after @xmath66 sweeps for the two - dimensional ising model computed by binary tree summation method ( circles ) , and errors in density of state @xmath67 from multicanonical method ( squares ) and a two - stage transition matrix monte carlo method ( triangles ) .",
    "the data are from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , we present a plot of specific heat of the ising model on a @xmath68 lattice .",
    "errors in comparison with exact results @xcite are indicated in the insert .",
    "for this lattice size , the errors are quite small for all values of @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] , we plot the average relative errors in @xmath31 , defined by @xmath69 the quantity @xmath31 plays the role of density of states as considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . for the binary tree summation data",
    ", we have rescaled the error by a factor @xmath70 so that the comparison of errors is on an equal footing of given amount of cpu time .",
    "as we can see from the plot , the errors for small lattices are much smaller than that of both the multi - canonical simulation and transition matrix monte carlo method @xcite . however , as the system size becomes larger than @xmath71 , the error becomes comparable and less favorable to the other methods .",
    "the decreased performance of binary tree summation method for large systems is partly due to the @xmath54 nature of the algorithm , and perhaps more importantly , it is not an importance sampling method .",
    "the fluctuation of the total weights @xmath72 in binary tree summation method is much smaller comparing to the @xmath41-fold way .",
    "nevertheless , the weights introduce extra errors and become important for large systems .",
    "the @xmath73 percolation problem do not have such problem as in that case the total weight for each @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "a `` fudge factor '' may be introduced in the probability of choosing a type-1 bond with the aim to reduce the total weight fluctuation .",
    "we are still investigating on such possibilities .",
    "we first compared the sweeny and gliozzi rates for the simulation of potts models .",
    "the sweeny and gliozzi rates give the same dynamics and also do not completely eliminate critical slowing down .",
    "we then introduced newman and ziff method for simulating percolation problem .",
    "our central goal is to simulate potts models in the fortuin - kasteleyn representation in the spirit of newman and ziff .",
    "binary tree summation method is our best attempt in this direction .",
    "although the samples are generated without correlation between sweeps , we lost the property of importance sampling . in this sense , we have not completely solved the problem , thus the methods are not efficient for large systems .",
    "we hope the present work will stimulate research for algorithms that have zero correlation , yet realize importance sampling .",
