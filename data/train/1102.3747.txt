    "there exists a transition from rabi to josephson oscillations as in the classical field driven system .",
    "the quantized field produces localized asymmetric dynamics for symmetric initial conditions while the classical field produces symmetric dynamics for symmetric initial conditions . for low coupling ratios , depending on the excitation ratio ,",
    "rabi oscillations localize in the southern hemisphere of the corresponding bloch sphere for low excitation ratios , and smoothly transit to cover both hemispheres for large excitation ratios ; completely identical coherent oscillations for symmetric initial conditions are only recovered for infinitely large excitation ratios . for large coupling ratios , there exists a critical excitation ratio that defines two different sets of dynamics ; below this critical excitation ratio , localized coherent oscillations , most of them showing an unbounded phase , appear in the southern hemisphere of the bloch sphere ; above the critical excitation ratio , two localized , or self - trapped , oscillation modes characteristic of josephson dynamics appear with asymmetric dynamics for symmetric initial conditions and a separatrix with a non - null fractional population difference .",
    "a pitchfork bifurcation , somehow similar to the classical field driven case , is found for large coupling and excitation ratios , in these cases the separatrix corresponds to ensemble states with negligible fractional population which are closer to their classical field driven equivalent ."
