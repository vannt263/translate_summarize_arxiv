    "small - scale fluctuations in the electron density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) scatter radio waves from pulsars .",
    "we can study properties of both the ism and the pulsar magnetosphere by measuring frequency - time characteristics of pulsar scintillation on the baseline of the cosmic interferometer resulting from scattering .",
    "interferometry provides for comparison of scintillation at two different places at the same time .",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate the spatial distribution of scattering along the line of sight to pulsar , one of the brightest and nearest pulsars .",
    "its distance , measured by parallax , is @xmath5 pc @xcite .",
    "the observations were conducted at a baseline projection of 220,000 km and with a spacecraft distance of 330,000 km providing angular resolution of 1 mas  the maximum ever achieved at meter wavelengths , on the longest baseline yet attained for vlbi observations , using the radioastron orbiting antenna .",
    "observations suggest the presence of three components of scattering material in our galaxy @xcite . the first is unevenly distributed material in the space between spiral arms ( component a ) .",
    "the second corresponds to a cavity of depleted electron density extending as far as 300 pc from the sun in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane and 50 to 100 pc in the galactic plane ( component b ) @xcite .",
    "the power spectra of density fluctuations for components a and b are well described by a kolmogorov spectrum with an index of 11/3 @xcite .",
    "the third , component c , is located only about 10 pc from the sun and has an increased level of turbulence .",
    "this component is responsible for the intra - day variability of quasars at centimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "as discussed in earlier papers @xcite , the main contributor to the scintillation of the nearby pulsars and is component c. the power spectrum of density fluctuations for these pulsars is flatter than the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "the index of the power - law is @xmath6 for and @xmath7 for . as shown by these studies , the level of turbulence in component c is a factor of 20 higher than that in the extended region responsible for scintillation of @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed that the scattering material in the direction of b0950 + 08 was uniformly distributed , and found that the level of turbulence an order of magnitude lower than for any previously measured interstellar line of sight .",
    "their results are also consistent with enhanced scattering in component c , at a distance of only 10 pc .",
    "idv sources show large - amplitude and rapid variability caused by scintillation in component c. the time scale of these variations is about the same as it would be for pulsars at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "@xcite suggested that the partially - ionized surfaces of nearby interstellar clouds are responsible for intraday variability .",
    "they note that observed intraday variable sources lie behind such clouds ; some where clouds collide . the nearby scattering screen",
    "for may have the same origin ; indeed , its line of sight passes through one of the clouds they identify",
    ". the far edge of the local bubble may also scatter . in this direction ,",
    "the edge of the local bubble lies at a distance of 120 to 160 pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of strong angular refraction in the direction to .",
    "interferometric observation of pulsars with space and earth antennas , for baselines of several earth diameters , provides the possibility of localizing the scattering layers and also allows one to evaluate the influence of refraction on the received emission .",
    "@xcite presents a preliminary theoretical analysis of this approach . for the first such vlbi observations of the crab pulsar with ground telescopes",
    "see @xcite . as we discuss in section  [",
    "sec : fresnelscales ] , the typical scale of the scattering pattern of a weakly - scattered pulsar is the fresnel scale , larger than an earth diameter . space - earth interferometry affords the possibility of measuring this scale directly , rather than allowing motions of pulsar , earth and scattering material to carry it across a single antenna .",
    "we make use of both interferometric and time - lag analyses in this paper ; the earlier work by @xcite used only single - dish observations and provides an interesting comparison .    because scintillation is a stochastic process ,",
    "observations must be compared with theoretically - predicted distributions .",
    "these distributions may not have analytical forms and can be quite difficult to compute ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , moments of the distributions , particularly in the form of structure functions , provide measures of the fundamental behavior of structure and coherence functions .",
    "section [ sec : ismscatteringtheory ] describes this approach in the present case .    in this paper",
    ", we present results obtained from observations of the pulsar carried out on 25 january 2012 at a frequency of 324 mhz with the radioastron space radio telescope in conjunction with the arecibo 300-m telescope ( ar ) and the westerbork synthesis array ( wb ) .",
    "the radioastron project is an international collaborative mission involving a free - flying satellite , spectr - r , carrying a 10-m space radio telescope ( srt ) on an elliptical orbit around the earth .",
    "this space telescope performs radio astronomical observations using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques in conjunction with ground - based vlbi networks .",
    "the orbit of the radioastron satellite evolves with time .",
    "it has an apogee between 280,000 and 350,000 km , a perigee between 7,000 and 80,000 km , a period of 8 to 9 days , and an initial inclination of @xmath8 .",
    "radioastron operates at the standard radio astronomical wavelengths of 1.19  1.63 cm ( k - band ) , 6.2 cm ( c - band ) , 18 cm ( l - band ) , and 92 cm ( p - band ) .",
    "technical parameters of the on - board scientific equipment and measured parameters have been described in two main publications @xcite .",
    "[ main ]      as we discuss in section  [ sec : analysis_and_results ] , pulsar shows scintillation with modulation @xmath9 , with typical bandwidth @xmath10 much less than the observing frequency @xmath11 .",
    "typically @xmath12 is observed only in weak scattering , whereas @xmath13 is observed only in strong scattering @xcite .",
    "these two regimes are distinct . in weak scattering",
    "the difference in phase among paths from source to observer is less than @xmath14 radians , but in strong scattering it is more .",
    "we suggest that a strong gradient in the column density of refracting material  a prism  is responsible for the apparent paradox",
    ". such a prism will disperse the wide - band scintillation pattern in the observer plane , so that maxima and minima appear at different places at different observing frequencies .",
    "indications of strong refractive effects include the typically `` refractive '' scaling of scintillation bandwidth with frequency found by @xcite , and the shift of the structure function of visibility with frequency , as a function of time lag , discussed in section  [ sec : asymmetry ] and displayed in figure  [ fig.8 ] .",
    "* see their figure 10 ) showed that the transition between weak and strong scattering for this pulsar takes place in the frequency range of 100 to 300  mhz , with of course strong scattering at lower frequencies .",
    "we find that 2 screens at different distances are required to reproduce the observed properties of scintillation .",
    "in particular , we find that the structure function of visibility with observing frequency is composed of two components with different timescales and different behavior as a function of interferometer baseline .",
    "we discuss the structure function in section  [ sub1.1 ] , and present the structure functions formed from our observations in section  [ sec : estimated_structure_function ] . because the scintillation is weak",
    ", the observed scintillation pattern in the observer plane is the superposition of the patterns from the two screens .",
    "this paper considers interferometric observations of scattering .",
    "the interferometric visiblity @xmath15 is as a function of frequency , time and baseline is the fundamental observable .",
    "we are concerned with the fluctuations of @xmath15 .",
    "we analyze these fluctuations using the fundamental behavior of structure and coherence functions . as we describe in this section",
    ", we relate the modulus of the visibility , the product of electric fields at two positions , to the product of the intensities at those positions .",
    "the resulting expressions are excellent when the noise level is low . in the case of a high level of noise , it is advantageous to measure fluctuations in the _ squared _ modulus of the interferometer cross - power spectrum @xmath16 . in appendix",
    "a , we derive the analogous relations that account for noise .",
    "in particular , we show that for statistics of @xmath16 the contributions of noise and signal are simply additive , whereas for statistics of @xmath15 or @xmath17 the contributions of noise and signal are much more difficult to separate .",
    "we therefore deal with the statistics of @xmath16 in this paper .",
    "we define @xmath18 as the electric field of pulsar emission , in the absence of a turbulent plasma , where @xmath19 is the offset of the observing frequency @xmath11 from the band center @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is time .",
    "this electric field @xmath18 also includes modulation by the receiver bandpass .",
    "the field after propagation through the ism can be represented as @xcite @xmath22 where scattering in the ism results in the factor @xmath23 , given that @xmath24 is the spatial coordinate in the observer plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "here and throughout the paper , we use boldface type to denote vector quantities , such as @xmath24 . to obtain the cross - power spectrum @xmath15  i.e.",
    ", the response of an interferometer with baseline @xmath25 averaged over a fixed realization of the scattering  we multiply @xmath26 by @xmath27 and average over statistics of the source electric field : @xmath28 where @xmath29 here , the angular brackets @xmath30 with subscript @xmath31 indicate an average over the noiselike statistics of the electric field of the source .",
    "the flux density of the source , corrected for bandpass , is @xmath32 ; and the effects of scattering are expressed by @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath32 depends on frequency within the observed band @xmath34 and on time @xmath21 , but we omit these arguments for clarity in the equations below .",

    "we normalize the average flux density of the source , so that the average over realizations of scintillations is unity : @xmath38 .",
    "we are concerned with the fluctuations of intensity about this average : @xmath39 .",
    "we suppose that the scattering material lies in two phase - changing screens located at distances @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the observer .",
    "the distance of the source form the observer is @xmath47 .",
    "each screen produces some variation of phase as a function of position .",
    "we can characterize the statistics of the phase screen by two spatial structure functions of phase fluctuations @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the differences of the spatial coordinates in the plane of the phase - changing screen : @xmath52 where @xmath53 identifies the screeen , and @xmath54 is the screen phase at @xmath55 . here",
    ", the angular brackets with subscript @xmath56 indicate an average over an ensemble of statistically - identical scattering media .",
    "@xcite showed that the spectrum of turbulence of the interstellar medium in the direction of has a power - law form , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is spatial frequency .",
    "consequently , the spatial structure functions of phase fluctuations exhibit a power - law form as well .",
    "we describe the structure functions of the two phase - changing screens with the expressions @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wavenumber , @xmath61 is the wavelength , and @xmath62 represents the angle of scattering at phase - changing screen @xmath53 .",
    "we assume a power - law form for the structure functions , with indices @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "note that this equation introduces the assumption that scattering is isotropic .",
    "we make this assumption for the rest of the paper . in principle , effects of anisotropy could be detected by comparing results on several baselines of comparable lengths and different orientations .",
    "thus , ongoing and future observations should be able to refine the results presented here . as was pointed out in (",
    "* see figure  [ fig.10 ] ) , the transition from strong to weak scintillation takes place in the frequency range 100 - 300  mhz .",
    "we will show in section  [ sub4.1 ] that modulation index @xmath65 at frequency 324  mhz is about 0.35 , so the scintillation is weak @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the fluctuations in phase introduced from propagation are small : @xmath66 .",
    "the modulation indices resulting from scattering at the screens are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , defined formally in equations  [ q21 ] and  [ q24 ] below .",
    "we can apply weak scattering theory because for a power - law spectrum of turbulence , the difference between approximate and exact values of @xmath69 does nt exeed of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "for a nearby screen at distance @xmath71 , we can use the plane wave approximation , so that @xmath72 for a phase - changing screen at distance @xmath46 , the structure function of phase fluctuations at the screen is related to that at the observer by : @xmath73 note that these equations describe the effects of the screen as a `` shadowgraph '' , where effects of the screen are projected directly onto the observer plane .",
    "this is characteristic of weak scattering .",
    "we suppose that a cosmic prism , or gradient of refracting material , is located between the pulsar and the phase - changing screens . this prism deflects radiation from the pulsar at a frequency - dependent refractive angle .",
    "we parametrize this refraction using @xmath74 , the apparent displacement of the source location as observed from the observer plane at frequency @xmath20 .",
    "similar strong angular refraction has been detected in the direction to from analysis of multi - frequency observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that strong angular refraction exists in the direction to , so we assume that the refractive angle is significantly greater than the scattering angle at either screen : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the introduction of @xmath289 decorrelates noise , without significant influence on @xmath33 , or @xmath15 .",
