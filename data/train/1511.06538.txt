    "superpositions of coherent states ( css ) are often referred to as schrdinger - cat states , as the constituents of the superposition are two quasi - classical states .",
    "it would be desirable to prepare quantum systems in such states both for practical and fundamental purposes .",
    "their non - classical properties could be exploited e.g. in quantum communication . in traveling wave optics",
    "there are a number of proposals to prepare schrdingar - cat states @xcite .",
    "photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum state is a successfully applied method to produce approximate css states @xcite .",
    "recently , squeezed csss were also generated with similar technique @xcite . in another proposal for conditional preparation , squeezed single photon states",
    "are let interfere on a beamsplitter and states in one arm are conditionally selected by photon detection @xcite .",
    "propagation through nonlinear media exhibiting the kerr effect was suggested in one of the first proposals to prepare css states @xcite .",
    "there has been several proposals employing the cross - kerr effect @xcite , as well as the self - kerr effect @xcite . a double cross - kerr scheme have recently been proposed by us @xcite , exploiting the interference of two similar states on a beam splitter for a conditional css preparation scheme .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a scheme with two identically prepared states by propagating a traveling wave coherent state through a self - kerr medium .",
    "the states are let interfere on a balanced beam splitter then one of them measured by balanced homodyne detection .",
    "the proposed scheme is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "two identical states are prepared from identical coherent states by letting them propagate through a medium exhibiting self - kerr effect .",

    "the css states may be distinguished only if we choose @xmath8 .",
    "further conditions of distinguishability stem from the requirement that the overlaps of the gaussian quadrature wave functions in mode 3 are minimal .    the constituent coherent states of the resulting css states in mode 4 form @xmath9 circles in phase space .",
    "this can be easily seen by calculating the absolute values of the coherent state amplitudes .",
    "the radii of the circles read @xmath10 the largest circle has a radius smaller , but close to @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we demonstrate on a concrete example how the proposed scheme works . we choose a moderate number @xmath12 , in order to explicitly show the working mechanism of selection . in practice",
    ", a weak self - kerr effect might require to work with higher values of @xmath13 , but the principle for preparation will be the same .",
    "the state incident on both inputs of the beam splitter reads @xmath14 the beam splitter transforms the states according to eq .",
    "[ eq : two - mode ]",
    ". we illustrate the complex amplitudes of the participating coherent states for both modes in fig .",
    "( [ fig : five ] ) .",
    "the state after homodyne detection will be a superposition of the vacuum and 10 different css states @xmath15 \\ , .\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath16 can be determined from eq .",
    "[ eq : detected ] .",
    "the css states in mode 4 , after the homodyne measurement of the value @xmath17 in mode 3 , are multiplied by the constants @xmath18 the actual ratio of the constants depend on the value of the measured quadrature .",
    "a good choice for homodyne measurement is to pick the most isolated coherent state . for @xmath12",
    "the best choice is to measure around the peak corresponding to the coherent state with amplitude @xmath19 in this way the state @xmath20 will be approximately prepared . in mode 4",
    "the constant multiplying the vacuum reads @xmath21 examining its absolute value as a function of @xmath22 , we find that it exhibits oscillations , and at certain points it can be exactly zero .",
    "the function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "let us fix , as an example , @xmath23 . with this choice",
    "the amplitudes of the other states in the superposition are negligible compared to the target css state ( the largest ones have the following numerical values : @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we note that with increasing the amplitude @xmath22 the weight of the other css state in the superposition decays monotonically , thus by the appropriate choice of the intensity of the input coherent state , one can achieve high fidelity preparation .",
    "we have proposed a conditional scheme to prepare coherent state superpositions . the scheme is based on a double self - kerr scheme , where two identically prepared states interfere on a balanced beam splitter and subsequently one of the outputs is measured by balanced homodyne detection .",
    "the detection event in general prepares a superposition of css states and the vacuum .",
    "we have shown that due to destructive interference the vacuum amplitude can be zero , depending on the amplitude of the initial coherent state and the selected css state .",
    "the separation of the selected css state can vary , conditioned on the measurement result .    the financial support by the czech - hungarian cooperation project ( cz-11/2009 ) is gratefully acknowledged ."
