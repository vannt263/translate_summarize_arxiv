    "an electrical double layer capacitor or supercapacitor basically consists of electrodes which are insulated by a separator and which are in contact with an electrolyte .",
    "supercapacitors are used as alternative electrical energy storage devices and combine the properties of conventional batteries , with high energy but low power densities , and conventional capacitors with the opposite characteristics @xcite .",
    "they are used in electric vehicles and mobile phone equipments . moreover , in search of sustainable energy systems there is still growing interest in double layer capacitors .",
    "the capacitive behavior is determined by the nature of the electrode material , e.g. , its porosity and accessible surface area .",
    "often carbon is the electrode material of choice and especially ordered carbon allotropes have received much attention because their micro - texture influences the electronic properties .",
    "different kinds of carbon nanostructured materials , including carbon nanotubes , carbon nanorods , spherical fullerenes , and carbon nano - onions , have been used as electrodes @xcite .",
    "fiber - shaped supercapacitors exhibit low weight and high flexibility and thus are promising candidates for power sources in wearable electronics @xcite . in contrast to conventional capacitors with smooth electrode morphologies , supercapacitors exhibit highly curved surfaces in order to obtain large specific areas , i.e. , high porosity .",
    "this poses the problem of understanding the properties of electric double layers at curved geometries . a suitable method to model an electric double layer",
    "is given by the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory .",
    "within this mesoscopic approach the focus is on length scales larger than the ions or solvent molecules because electrolyte solutions are taken to consist of pointlike ions dissolved in a homogeneous solvent which is described by its electric permittivity only .",
    "the pb theory has been pioneered by gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite in the 1910s and sometimes it is referred to as the gouy - chapman theory .",
    "although the model is simple , reliable predictions can be expected to hold for low ionic strengths ( below @xmath3 ) and low electrode potentials ( below @xmath4 ) , in the case of aqueous solutions and monovalent salts @xcite .",
    "for that reason and due to its simplicity the pb theory is used frequently . under certain circumstances",
    "it even allows for exact solutions , e.g. , for electrolyte solutions at planar electrodes @xcite .",
    "recently , exact results have been presented for an electrolyte bounded by parallel plates or inside a cylindrical charged wall if only counterions are considered @xcite .",
    "this setup might be used as a description for ions confined in a charged nanotube or pore . however , for the corresponding spherical system , so far a solution in closed form has not been found . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same authors presented an expansion for the solution of the pb equation in spherical and cylindrical geometries with large radii of curvature , which might resemble charged macromolecules surrounded by an electrolyte solution and which comes closest to an analytic solution of the full pb equation for these geometries . within the framework of the linearized gouy - chapman - stern theory in ref .",
    "@xcite a model for an arbitrary surface morphology was developed .",
    "this facilitates , for example , the calculation of capacitances of nanostructured electrodes , the study of which might contribute to the development of efficient energy generating and storage devices .",
    "but also for numerical studies the pb equation often is the model of choice because its simplicity allows for fast calculations : in order to understand the properties of the diffuse double layer at charged nanoelectrodes or carbon nanotubes the pb equation was solved in refs .",
    "@xcite for spherical and cylindrical electrodes .",
    "the potential and capacitance were analyzed for various values of the electrode radius .",
    "the evolution of capacitance models for supercapacitors gave rise to the study in ref .",
    "@xcite in which cylindrical and slit pores were considered within the gouy - chapman - stern model to address , inter alia , the issue of how the pore shape affects the capacitance .",
    "however , to our knowledge , so far the dependence of the capacitance on the geometry has only been addressed on a sample basis , i.e. , for particular choices of system parameters . the intention of the present work is to study the curvature dependence of the capacitance systematically within the entire , relevant parameter space .    in the present study",
    "the pb equation is solved for electrolytes surrounding spherical and cylindrical electrodes ( see sec .  [ section : model ] ) .",
    "in addition to presenting results for a variety of parameter choices , a thorough overview of the spectrum of solutions is given .",
    "to that end the dependence of the differential capacitance on the various parameters is analyzed in detail within the pb theory for these geometries .",
    "we are able to discuss the limiting behavior systematically , i.e. , the dependence on only one parameter or analytically .",
    "this facilitates the understanding of the essential behavior of the data of interest which in the present case is the differential capacitance as a function of the wall curvature . in sec .",
