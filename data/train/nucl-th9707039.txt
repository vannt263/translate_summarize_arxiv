    "since the discovery of pulsars @xcite and their identification @xcite as rotating neutron stars during the late 1960 s , much theoretical work have been done to study the structure of neutron stars . at the core of these objects , the density could be as high as five to ten times the nuclear matter density ( @xmath0 ) which falls down by several orders of magnitude in the crust region .",
    "the nature of matter at such high densities in the core is still an unresolved issue @xcite . over the two decades ,",
    "many of the studies were addressed towards a resolution of this problem ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been conjectured in particular that there exists a phase transition between nuclear matter ( nm ) and quark matter ( qm ) at high densities [ 5 - 11 ] .",
    "witten @xcite has further speculated that the strange quark matter ( sqm ) consisting of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks may be the absolute ground state of hadronic matter .",
    "if this is true , then the possibility that pulsars are objects made up of purely sqm can not be ruled out .",
    "recently , from a semiempirical analysis of the mass - radius relationship li _ et al _",
    "@xcite have suggested that her x-1 pulsar maybe a strange quark star ( see also @xcite ) . on the basis of these hypotheses , several authors",
    "[ 3,5 - 11 ] have studied the properties of stars consisting of only sqm , _",
    "i.e. _ strange quark stars ( sqs ) and neutron stars having quark cores with nucleon envelopes , _ viz .",
    "_ hybrid stars ( hs ) . in general , the transition between the nuclear and quark matter is considered to occur at a unique pressure determined by gibbs criteria , ( we consider the transition to be first order ) .",
    "inside the star , the pressure decreases smoothly outwards .",
    "the mixed phase has constant pressure independent of the volume fraction of the phases and therefore , the mixed phase collapses to a single point on the density profile of the star .",
    "consequently , the mixed phase can not exist in the hybrid star .",
    "glendenning @xcite has recently proposed that for systems with more than one conserved charge , the qm and nm could coexist for a finite range of pressures .",
    "a well - defined mixed phase may therefore be present @xcite over a finite region within the star ( hereafter referred to as the droplet phase ) .",
    "occurrence of a droplet phase ( dp ) have quite important observational consequences . in particular , the values of @xmath4equilibriated proton fraction @xmath5 in dp can be large enough to allow direct urca process to happen , and hence , is of significance to the cooling process of neutron stars .",
    "however , whether or not such a dp is energetically favourable depends largely upon the nature of dense matter .",
    "as yet , the exact nature of dense nuclear matter is not known , and several possibilities are equally probable .",
    "very recently , we had shown @xcite , using a well - defined , finite range , momentum and density dependent interaction , that pure neutron matter undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at density @xmath6 .",
    "using such an equation of state , we then made a detailed study of structural properties of neutron and hybrid stars , and showed that one could , in principle , explain both the surface magnetic field and the standard structural properties .",
    "an interesting result is that @xmath4equilibriated proton fraction @xmath5 decreases sharply once the star matter becomes spin polarised ( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) . one then naturally wonders , what is the effect of such phase transitions on the occurrence and properties of dp ?",
    "in particular , whether or not ferromagnetic domains , _ i.e. _ droplets of spin polarised matter , exist inside a star . and , what is the role of spin polarisation in the determination of @xmath5 , and thereby , on the possibility of direct urca process .",
    "in view of these , we mainly investigate the following .",
    "firstly , whether the proposed equation of state , based on an interaction with firm basis in the well known properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei , which predicts a ferromagnetic phase transition permits a droplet phase . secondly , if such a phase is allowed , what are the effects of spin polarisation on the star structure ? finally , can one consistently describe the standard structural properties and surface magnetic field , as well as find the finite probability for the direct urca process to happen ?",
    "now , in addition to the properties of dense nuclear matter , the nature of the quark matter equation of state can also affect the possibility of formation of a droplet phase .",
    "the theoretical framework that has been used in general to study hs and sqs is the mit bag model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the non - perturbative aspects of quark - quark interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ the confinement property is invoked through a bag parameter .",
    "an alternate way of implementing confinement has also been explored @xcite , which is hereafter referred to as effective mass model of confinement . in this approach ,",
    "the quark masses are assumed to be density dependent . in the limit of high densities ,",
    "their values tend towards the current quark masses ; in the limit of zero density , the quark masses become infinite .",
    "attempts have been made @xcite to study the properties of sqs in this approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was noted that the properties of sqm obtained using the density dependent quark masses are quite different from those obtained using the mit bag model . this was subsequently contested in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that both the approaches yield similar results .",
    "an intriguing aspect in the latter study is that the pressure does not vanish at the density where the energy per baryon has a minimum .",
    "this contradicts the very definition of the ground state of a system .",
    "as shown in the following section , both these studies have incorrectly determined the quark chemical potentials .",
    "due to the explicit density dependence of quark masses , there is an extra term , the so - called rearrangement energy , in the definition of chemical potential .",
    "taking this term into account , it is shown that the energy minimum and zero pressure occur at the same density point .",
    "further , we make a comparative study of properties of hybrid stars as obtained using the effective mass model and bag model of quark confinement .",
    "it may also be said here that in addition to the bulk properties of the equations of state , the finite size effects @xcite such as coulomb , surface and curvature contributions can affect the possible formation of the droplet phase inside a star . however , it is known that surface tension of qm is poorly determined @xcite , and is also found to be dependent upon the shape of the confining potential @xcite .",
    "moreover , the internal structure of the droplet phase is generally determined by the competition between the coulomb and surface energies , and can adopt shapes like rods , plates and spheres @xcite . here , since we are mainly concerned with the effect of spin polarisation in the formation of the droplet phase ,",
    "the finite size effects are presently not considered .",
    "in the following , we briefly outline the procedure to obtain the quark equation of state in the effective mass approximation .      the two important properties of qcd , namely the asymptotic freedom and the confinement , are adequately represented by considering that quarks are bound by a local dirac - scalar potential , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "presence of a strong dirac - scalar component is found to be consistent with the concept of chiral symmetry @xcite . in terms of @xmath8 , one can then define the quark effective mass as @xmath9 @xcite . its average value in the bulk matter limit",
    "is taken to be of the form , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the current quark mass , @xmath12 is the baryon number density and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are parameters to be determined by requiring that strange quark matter is stable or unstable against the normal nuclear matter . in this effective mass model , quark - quark interactions",
    "are assumed to be included through the density dependence of the quark masses .",
    "further , eq . ( [ effm ] ) implies that in the asymptotically free regime , _",
    "i.e. _ at high densities , @xmath15 , the current quark mass . in the limit @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    "; this gives rise to absolute confinement .",
    "consider a system of one kind of quarks with an effective mass @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ effm ] ) .",
    "then , the total quark number @xmath19 and the energy @xmath20 of the given system are determined using the expressions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the momentum and @xmath18 is in units of @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",

    "the term @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ spen ] ) arises solely due to the density dependence of quark mass . in the context of nuclear physics ,",
    "such a term is normally referred to as the rearrangement energy @xcite .",
    "because of this term , the single particle levels depend explicitly upon the value of the fermi momentum @xmath35 . in the limit @xmath36",
    ", one can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ spen ] ) the chemical potential @xmath28 , equivalently the fermi energy @xmath37 to be @xmath38 similarly , the quark number density @xmath39 and the energy density @xmath40 are determined using eq .",

    "we now demonstrate that eqs .",
    "( [ epsif ] ) and ( [ rhoq ] ) are consistent with the well - known hugenholtz - van hove ( hvh ) theorem @xcite arrived at in the context of interacting fermi systems . the hvh theorem in general deals with the single particle properties of an interacting fermi gas at @xmath46 .",

    "then at equilibrium , _ i.e. _ at the density corresponding to zero pressure one has as a special case , @xmath49 .",

    "( [ epsif ] ) demonstrating the consistency with the hvh theorem .",
    "the results are equally true for multicomponent quark systems also .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to the mixed phase as obtained by the common tangent method .",

    "this was also noted in earlier studies @xcite . in the limits of low density @xmath226 and high density @xmath227",
    ", the droplet phase smoothly joins with the nm and qm equations of state respectively as it should .",
    "it may be parenthetically noted that the `` down - turn '' behaviour in the quark matter eos in the low density region in fig . 5 is due to the choice of the parameter @xmath14 . in the limit @xmath16 , the quark energy density @xmath45 [ eq .

    "( [ effm ] ) ] is generally taken to be of harmonic oscillator type , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath232 .",
    "we now explore the possible consequences of the presence of a droplet phase on the structure of the hybrid star . to do this , we solve the tov equation using the eos shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "the baryon number density and mass distributions inside the star , corresponding to the maximum mass configuration , determined using the effective mass and bag models are shown in figs . 7 and 8 respectively . the hybrid star structure in the effective mass is characterised by the central density @xmath233 , the radius @xmath234 and maximum mass @xmath235 .",
    "in the bag model we have @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "one sees from figs . 7 and 8",
    "that the droplet phase extends in both the models from @xmath239 to @xmath240 , and stars contain a core of about @xmath241 made of only qm and a crust region of about @xmath242 made up of only nm . we find that the droplet phase encompasses most of the volume of the star in agreement with an earlier study @xcite . in a recent study @xcite using the color - dielectric model , it was however noted that the substantial part of the core of the star contains only qm , and the droplet occupies roughly @xmath243 of the total volume .",
    "it must be stressed that these finer details are in general model - dependent .",
    "finally , the main conclusion of this section is that with the correct treatment of quark chemical potentials , we find that the hybrid star properties as obtained within the bag and effective mass models are quite similar .",
    "for this reason , for the study on the effect of spin polarisation on droplet phase , done in the following section , we use only the standard bag model .",
    "in this section , we explore the properties of the hybrid stars using the proposed nm equation of state given by eqs .",
    "( [ msbe ] ) and ( [ msbp ] ) , which predicts a ferromagnetic phase transition at high densities .",
    "firstly , to know whether there exists a phase transition between the nuclear matter phase described by eqs .",
    "( [ msbe],[msbp ] ) and the qm phase characterised by the bag model eos , eq .",
    "( [ bageos ] ) , we compare the total energies per baryon obtained in the two phases .",
    "the parameters chosen for this purpose are as given in section iii.b for nm phase , and for qm , we have taken @xmath244 mev and @xmath245 mev .",
    "further , in the case of nm , the total energy is minimised with respect to both the neutron and proton spin polarisation parameters , @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively .",
    "this energy minimised nuclear matter calculation is hereafter referred to as emnm .",
    "in addition , we also calculated the total energies for unpolarised nuclear matter ( unm ) , where @xmath248 and @xmath249 at all densities .",
    "results of these calculations are displayed in fig .",
    "one can observe a slight bend in the emnm curve at @xmath250 .",
    "this point indicates the ferromagnetic phase transition density , @xmath251 , where the optimum value of @xmath246 sharply increases from zero to unity .",
    "( this feature is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "it is also seen that a polarised nuclear matter ( pnm ) phase is energetically favourable over the density region @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the nm - qm phase transition density .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether there exists a droplet phase consisting of droplets of sqm and pnm .",
    "for this purpose , we made an attempt to solve for the droplet phase following the same procedure detailed in section v. it was then found that there exists no solution for phase equilibrium between sqm and pnm phases . in order to understand this result , we do the following analysis .",
    "firstly , to show the effect of increasing proton fraction on @xmath246 , we calculated , for given values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 , the optimum value of @xmath246 by energy minimisation .",
    "values of @xmath246 so determined are plotted in fig .",
    "10 as a function of density for few values of @xmath5 .",
    "( it may be said here that for @xmath254 , values usually found in the droplet phase , the maximum of the optimum value of @xmath247 , obtained with increase in density , is very nearly zero . ) as @xmath5 increases , the value of @xmath251 increases and the maximum value of @xmath246 , given by @xmath255 , decreases .",
    "therefore , in general , one might say that nm phase with large value of @xmath5 disfavours spin polarisation . on the otherhand ,",
    "as it was noted @xcite before , as nm gets spin polarised the @xmath4equilibriated @xmath5 sharply falls to zero , which is also evident from fig .",
    "11 , where we have shown mass per baryon versus density for certain cases .",
    "one can see that there is a slight deviation , for densities @xmath256 , between the emnm ( with @xmath257 ) curve and the emnm curve obtained taking @xmath4equilibriation into account , which is essentially due to non - zero , though small , values of @xmath5 .",
    "however , as density is increased further , the two curves coincide exactly illustrating the fact that @xmath4equilibriated @xmath5 values become zero at @xmath258 .",
    "another interesting aspect is that beyond the ferromagnetic transition density , the pnm phase is energetically more favourable than the unm with large values of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , for densities @xmath259 , droplets of unm with @xmath260 would prefer to become pnm with @xmath257 .",
    "that is , one expects a transition from a state @xmath261 to a state @xmath262 .",
    "but , this change of state , in the context of formation of a dp , is disallowed for the following reasons .",
    "in contrast to the usual mixed phase defined by the common tangent method , in the case of a droplet phase , the electron density is same both in nm and qm phases . restricting to densities @xmath259 , the following three cases are considered .",
    "+ _ case  1 _ : firstly , let us consider the simplest situation with @xmath263 and @xmath264 , where we have neglected the small @xmath265 mass .",
    "then , the optimum configuartion for qm phase gives @xmath266 and @xmath267 , where we have taken @xmath268 .",
    "for the nm phase , at @xmath259 , the optimum configuartion gives @xmath257 and @xmath269 .",
    "thus , one finds that the two phases are separately charge neutral , and hence corresponds to the usual mixed phase with @xmath264 .",
    "+ _ case  2 _ : secondly , let us consider as in case 1 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "but now , we insist that @xmath270 .",
    "then the optimum configuration for the qm phase gives @xmath266 with @xmath271 , and thereby the qm droplets are now positively charged . for the global charge neutrality condition to be satisfied , the nm droplets should be negatively charged . however , according to the optimum configuration , the nm droplets consists of only spin polarised neutrons .",
    "therefore , in this case , there exists no dp solution .",
    "+ _ case  3 _ : finally , let us consider the general situation , where @xmath272 ( and @xmath273 ) , and @xmath270 .",
    "now with finite electron density , the @xmath4equilibrium condition pertaining to the nm droplets , at a density @xmath12 , is given by @xmath274 . since @xmath275",
    ", the slope factor @xmath276 must be negative .",
    "12 , it can be seen that this is satisfied for the configuration unm , i.e. @xmath277 and @xmath248 .",
    "this then suggests that nm droplets with @xmath278 in dp may remain unpolarised with @xmath279 , which however is not the optimum configuration for nm phase .",
    "thus , due to the nature of droplet phase , that is , constancy of electron density in both phases , and the interplay of @xmath5 and @xmath246 , one finds that nm droplets with @xmath278 in dp may remain unpolarised with @xmath279 .",
    "it may be remembered that the usual mixed phase between sqm and pnm however exists . in the following subsection ,",
    "we explore the possibility of forming a dp with unm phase and sqm phase .",
    "> from our earlier study on hybrid stars , it can be seen ( from table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that for the chosen set of parameters , the central density of the star is about @xmath280",
    ". therefore , the unm - sqm phase transition at @xmath281 is of more relevance . following the same procedure described in section v , we then solved the set of simultaneous equations corresponding to @xmath4equilibrium , charge neutrality , chemical and mechanical equilibria .",
    "results obtained for the droplet phase along with the usual mixed phase are shown in fig . 13 .",
    "it can be seen that as in other cases , the droplet phase extends well beyond the mixed phase .",
    "interestingly , the droplet phase is energetically favourable even than the emnm case over the region @xmath282 .",
    "further , in this particular case , only a part of dp is allowed as emnm configuration takes over at high densities .",
    "thus , one has according to the minimum energy criterion , a dp sandwiched between unm and pnm phases .",
    "we now explore the possible consequences of the presence of a dp on the structure of hybrid stars .    in fig .",
    "14 , we show the proton fraction obtained in the dp using the realistic interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ msb ] ) ] , and compare with the one obtained within the simple parametrisation [ eq .",
    "( [ nmeos1 ] ) ] .",
    "it can be seen that the general trend is quite similar in both the cases .",
    "values of @xmath5 as obtained with the realistic interaction is somewhat lower than the simple one . as the bag model parameters are more or less the same , this could be due to the fact that the eos based on realistic interaction is relatively softer than the simple parametrised eos .",
    "nevertheless , values of @xmath5 is high enough to allow for direct urca process to happen .",
    "we now solve the tov equation ( [ tov ] ) using the eos shown in fig .",
    "13 , and obtain the structural properties such as mass and size of the star . the baryon number density and mass distribution inside the star , corresponding to the maximum mass configuration ,",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "the maximum mass configuration is characterised by the central density @xmath283 , the radius @xmath284 and maximum mass @xmath285 .",
    "now , from fig .",
    "15 , one observes that there exists a mixed phase consisting of droplets of sqm and unm sandwiched between a pnm core and unm crust .",
    "the droplet phase extends from @xmath286 to @xmath287 .",
    "more interestingly , there exists also a core of about 1 @xmath288 consisting pnm .",
    "thus , the salient features of this star structure are the following .",
    "firstly , the mass and size of the star obtained in the present calculation is well within the acceptable limits .",
    "secondly , due to the presence of a droplet phase , the value of @xmath5 found inside the star allows direct urca process to happen , and thereby have important consequences on the cooling process of neutron stars .",
    "finally , due to the presence of a spin polarised core , we could also , in principle , explain the surface magnetic field of neutron stars .",
    "value of the magnetic field at the surface of the star due to the presence of a ferromagnetic core can be estimated using the relation @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the number of neutrons in the ferromagnetic phase and @xmath291 is the star size . then using @xmath292 nuclear magneton",
    ", we get @xmath293 .",
    "thus , the surface magnetic field is somewhat overestimated compared to the observed value @xmath294 .",
    "however , by fine - tuning the parameter @xmath153 , as @xmath295 is sensitive to this parameter , one could arrive at the right value .    before summarising our findings",
    ", we would like to stress that the star s internal structure very much depends upon the model parameters chosen .",
    "for example , keeping @xmath153 fixed at 15 mev , and decreasing the bag parameter from 180 mev to 170 mev , one can see from fig .",
    "16 that pnm phase is no more allowed by energy minimum criterion . on the otherhand , with the bag parameter fixed at 180 mev and increasing @xmath153 from 15 mev to 17 mev , one finds that , though there exists a small density region where dp is favoured , pnm phase occupies larger phase space than the dp as illustrated in fig .",
    "hence , in this case , the surface magnetic field will be largely overestimated .",
    "however , within an allowed set of parameters , we could , in principle , quite satisfactorily explain the structural properties , surface magnetic field as well as allow for the formation of a dp .",
    "to summarize , firstly , we have constructed a quark matter equation of state in the effective mass approximation and then applied it to investigate some properties of strange quark matter with particular reference to hybrid and strange quark stars . in this effective mass model ,",
    "the quark masses are chosen to be density dependent and the absolute confinement of quarks as well as the asymptotic freedom are adequately taken care of through this density dependence . with these effective masses",
    ", it is seen that the chemical potential acquires an extra term , the so - called rearrangement term .",
    "presence of such a term in the single particle energy is consistent with the well - known hugenholtz - van hove theorem .",
    "thus , the present calculation , in contrast to earlier studies , correctly treats the quark chemical potentials in the effective mass model .",
    "secondly , we make a comparative study of hybrid star properties as obtained within the effective mass and bag models . for nuclear matter equation of state , we first used a simple parametrisation .",
    "it is found that a well - defined mixed phase of droplets of quark and nuclear matter sandwiched between a pure quark matter core and a crust of only nuclear matter exists . this mixed phase is found to occupy most of the volume of the star .",
    "the main result of this comparative study is that both the bag and effective mass models yield similar results .",
    "thirdly , using a realistic equation of state of nuclear matter based on a finite range , momentum and density dependent ( frmdd ) interaction , which predicts a ferromagnetic phase transition at a density @xmath296 , we investigated the effect of spin polarisation on the formation of a droplet phase .",
    "it is found that as nuclear matter gets polarised , the value of proton fraction @xmath5 drops sharply to zero , or vice versa , as @xmath5 increases , the transition density @xmath295 increases and hence matter with @xmath260 prefers to remain unpolarised . because of this interplay between @xmath246 and @xmath5 , there exists no mixed phase consisting of droplets of strange quark matter and polarised nuclear matter .",
    "finally , using the same equation of state based on frmdd interaction alongwith the usual bag model , we find that a droplet phase consisting of strange quark matter and unpolarised nuclear matter can however exist .",
    "this droplet phase is sandwiched between a core made up of polarised nuclear matter and a crust containing unpolarised nuclear matter .",
    "this , in principle , allows for a satisfactory explanation of the structural properties and surface magnetic field of neutron stars and keeps room for their rapid cooling due to the direct urca process .",
