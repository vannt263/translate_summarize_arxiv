    "although early reports have suggested a ferromagnetic order in ru1212  @xcite and ru1222  @xcite , neutron scattering results have indicated the presence of antiferromagnetism  @xcite with an upper limit of @xmath19 for a ferromagnetic component .",

    "the origin of the high - temperature ordering continues to be a subject of debate .",
    "except for the obvious intrinsic scenario , an impurity - based explanation has been proposed  @xcite with sr - ru - cu - o@xmath11 phase showing similar temperature dependence of the coercive field as the ru1222 system .",
    "cu@xmath92 ions are thought to be inhomogeneously distributed in both ru and sr sites which causes sr - ru - cu - o@xmath11 phase to act as an independent particle inside the ru@xmath79 matrix .",
    "this study has been conducted on a system with a long - range ferromagnetic order where magnetic domains and domain walls play a dominant role in the mechanism behind the coercivity . on the other hand , nanosized particles incorporated in the ru1222 matrix",
    "can be considered as monodomain structures , with a superparamagnetic blocking as the main mechanism generating the coercive field .",
    "although an anisotropy ( @xmath93 ) is involved in both processes , a temperature dependence of the coercive field in a bulk system should not be taken as an indicator for nanosized particles .",
    "this leaves the intrinsic scenario as a probable mechanism , but we are still missing the microscopic explanation of it .",
    "other features observed in this report are also unlikely to be related to the presence of impurities .",
    "the ru1212 system has been investigated before  @xcite and , apart from the sign of the third harmonic , the same features have been observed .",
    "furthermore , through the investigation of ru@xmath22sr@xmath1ycu@xmath23o@xmath24 ( ru1212y ) we have shown that upon introduction of a structural disorder due to the incorporation of cu ions into the ruo@xmath4 planes , the ru1212 system s predominant ordering at @xmath49 does not change .",
    "on the other hand , the peak at @xmath49 , which presumably reflects the interaction of domain walls in the canted afm state with the external field , is strongly influenced with the imposed disorder , indicating that the magnetic response from the ru1212gd compound is intrinsic to the ru1212 system .",
    "oe for all the investigated concentrations of the ru1222eu system .",
    "@xmath73 is developed for all the concentrations .",
    "@xmath66 has @xmath73 and @xmath75 overlapped.,width=453 ]    in the ru1222 system all the different _",
    "re_/ce ratios show consistent behavior between the first and the third harmonic . @xmath74 and @xmath75 change in accordance with the change in @xmath8 and in the @xmath9sr experiment  @xcite",
    "it has been shown that this involves more than 90% of the sample s volume .",
    "the detection limit of x - ray diffraction measurements for our samples indicates @xmath94% of impurities  @xcite , confirming that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are intrinsic to the ru1222 system .",
    "the anomaly around 120 k has been observed in all previously investigated ru1222 samples and has been linked to the high temperature transition around 180 k  @xcite .",
    "substitution of ru ions with mo ions  @xcite showed that while the main magnetic transition is shifted , the anomaly remains unchanged .",
    "if the anomaly is related to some sort of impurities in the ru1222 system , one would expect drastic changes in position and intensity , which has not been observed .",
    "in addition , the higher harmonics are orders of magnitude weaker than the first harmonic and we have shown that the anomaly appears even for the smallest fields used .",
    "this strongly implies that the anomaly is intrinsic to the ru1222 system .",
    "several novel features have been observed in our study of the nonlinear susceptibility of ruthenocuprates . in ru1212",
    "we have found a negative third harmonic of the ac susceptibility , with a clear separation between the main magnetic transition and the formation of superparamagnetic particles .",
    "the divergent - like behavior of the third harmonic at the main magnetic transition indicates a long - range ordered state .",
    "previous reports favored a canonical afm state with magnetic moments pointing along the c - axis .",
    "our results contradict this hypothesis since canonical afm systems are expected to show a nondiverging positive third harmonic .",
    "we propose that the majority of magnetic moments order in a canted afm state , in accordance with the neutron diffraction results .",
    "the dominant ferromagnetic response comes from the separated , short - range ordered particles which are blocked below a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the main magnetic transition .",
    "the peak appearing below @xmath0 for larger magnetic fields has been ascribed to an interaction between domains of weak ferromagnetic moments and the applied field .",
    "nonlinear response in the ru1222 system revealed two characteristic temperatures around @xmath8 , in line with @xmath9sr and mssbauer results .",
    "the charateristic lower temperature @xmath74 coincides with the main magnetic transition @xmath8 seen in the linear response .",
    "the divergence of the third harmonic at @xmath74 is an indication of the onset of a long - range order .",
    "we have observed a small negative feature in @xmath31 around 180 k for all compositions .",
    "this is a possible signature of a minority phase ordering into supeparamagnetic particles .    in both ruthenocuprate systems",
    "the third harmonic starts to show in the temperature range @xmath60 k. below this temperature short - range correlations bind individual spins into larger clusters giving rise to an observed nonlinearity .",
    "it is important to notice that when the third harmonic starts to show a deviation from the curie - weiss behavior occurs , which can be crucial when determining a paramagnetic moment from the curie - weiss plot .",
