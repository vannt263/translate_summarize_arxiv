    "fluctuations of physical quantities near zero frequency have been investigated by several authors since the papers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a general theory on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which will be the starting point of this paper , was developed by @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a concrete expression for the low - frequency spectrum of fluctuations of magnetic fields in a thermal plasma was obtained for the first time by @xcite .",
    "they found a peak around @xmath1 magnetic fluctuation which was interpreted as the evanescent energy component of electromagnetic fluctuations `` screened '' in a plasma below the plasma frequency .",
    "the impact of such result into the cosmic microwave background was then investigated by @xcite .",
    "although in these two references the authors claim that the fluctuations were rigorously computed , several approximations were indeed made and they were not able to get an unique formula covering the low- and high - frequency spectrum .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reevaluate the derivation of the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations avoiding approximations in the low - frequency region and also in the transition between the low- and the high - frequency spectrum .",
    "several different behaviors between our results and the previous one , mainly in the low - frequency part of the spectrum , are found and discussed .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem developed by @xcite is able to deal with the thermal fluctuations inside a plasma in or near thermal equilibrium .",
    "the expression for the magnetic field fluctuation in an homogeneous isotropic non - magnetized equilibrium plasma was obtained by @xcite looking at waves in such a plasma . in an electron - positron plasma , for example",
    ", the magnetic fluctuations in wave number and frequency space is given by    @xmath2 \\omega^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the plasma and the collisional frequencies . here",
    "@xmath6 , and @xmath7 being @xmath8 the particle density inside the plasma , @xmath9 is the atomic number of these constituents , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the charge and the mass of the electron , and @xmath12 is the lorentz factor given by @xmath13 .",
    "this result can be integrated in @xmath14 to get ( the fourier transform ) @xmath15 and the magnetic energy density is @xmath16 .",
    "the integral of eq .",
    "( [ original - formula ] ) over wave numbers shows a high wave number divergence . according to @xcite , this",
    "is expected since the derivation is based on classical fluid equations of motion and the constant collision frequency @xmath5 is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "however , they prefer to carry on their analyzes in the simpler phenomenological approach . in order to overcome the large @xmath17 dependence",
    ", they first take the limit @xmath18 and then they integrate over @xmath17 to infinity , which corresponds to the vanishing cross section of collisions as @xmath19 .",
    "this is a very delicate point and we will turn back to this point in section  [ general ] . for both the high frequency and high wave number",
    "limits the authors emphasized that the expression of eq .",
    "( [ original - formula ] ) has a substantial value only where @xmath20 .",
    "the combined high - frequency and high wave - number limits were get by letting @xmath18 .",
    "the expression for the low - frequency spectrum was obtained by breaking up the @xmath17 integral into two intervals , by introducing a cutoff value @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . in the integration from 0 to @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath5 was kept finite while in the integral from @xmath21 it was used the approximation @xmath18 .",
    "the expressions obtained for the high and low parts of the spectrum was , respectively :    @xmath23    and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the heaviside step function , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "finally the zero frequency limit of the magnetic fluctuations is give by @xmath29    at this point the frequency spectral intensity was plotted for a temperature @xmath30  k by requiring that the value of @xmath21 ( or @xmath31 ) provide a smooth behavior at the joint between the low - frequency spectrum and the black - body spectrum .",
    "the choice was @xmath32 or ( @xmath33 .",
    "the result for other values of the temperature were presented in another paper by @xcite .",
    "the main claims by these authors was that the intensity of the spectrum does not vary sensitively with @xmath21 and that near @xmath34 the spectrum goes like @xmath35 .",
    "let us now show our results .",
    "we have integrated eq .",
    "( [ original - formula ] ) over @xmath17 analytically , without any approximation , by the partial fractions technique . the exact result for the indefinite integral over",
    "the wave number is :    @xmath36\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the following definitions : @xmath37 is the debye length , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and    @xmath49    where @xmath50 .",
    "note that the general result shows only a linear divergence in @xmath17 restricted to the first term of eq .",
    "( [ indef_integ ] ) .",
    "this term , however , can not be simply discarded by doing the limit @xmath51 before we integrate over @xmath17 , as did by @xcite , since it plays a very important role when the strict limit @xmath52 ( which we prefer to indicate from now on by @xmath53 ) is to be considered , even when @xmath17 is large .",
    "indeed , if we discard it for all large values of @xmath17 it can be shown that the limit @xmath54 of @xmath55 will be negative .",
    "therefore , our result for the definite integral can be put in the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 the term @xmath58 will be taken as @xmath59 with @xmath60 as large as we want .",
    "this will render the confrontation with the previous result easier .",
    "we note that for @xmath61  @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "these three terms can be written as functions of the original parameters , considering that    @xmath64 } + \\omega(\\omega^2 + \\eta^2 -\\omega_p^2)\\right]^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath65 } - \\omega ( \\omega^2 + \\eta^2 -\\omega_p^2)\\right]^{1/2}\\ ] ] compared to eqs .",
    "( [ tajima_high])-([zero_lim_tajima ] ) it is immediately evident how our result is different from those of equations , showing a much more complicated dependence of the frequency spectrum on the variable @xmath66 , and on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which dependencies on plasma temperature are shown , respectively , in figures  [ fig - omega ] .        our full result @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - full ] , where both the normalized ( gray curve ) and non normalized ( green curve ) spectral intensities are given , for @xmath67  @xmath62 e @xmath68",

    "( [ our - limit ] ) . ]    in this figure we have also plotted each one of the terms that contribute to @xmath55 are shown in different colors . the deep we see in this figure near @xmath72 tends to disappear as @xmath0 goes to high values ; as @xmath0 decreases up to @xmath73  @xmath62 , the ordinate of the deep tends to zero .",
    "the detail of the non normalized spectral intensity near @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - detail ] .",
    "it shows naturally a smooth behavior between the low - frequency spectrum and the blackbody spectrum , which is constructed by hand in @xcite .",
    ".,height=302 ]    if we compare this graph to the correspondent one shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) of the paper of @xcite , we see that our result , for @xmath75 , is a classical blackbody radiation spectrum which goes to zero at @xmath76 while their blackbody spectrum has a much greater width ( more than two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "another important qualitative difference between the non approximate and the approximate results is that we found a very peculiar oscillations in @xmath55 for the @xmath77 region of the spectrum , as can be seen from figure  [ fig - detail - k10 ] .",
    "these oscillations occur in an @xmath78 region where the classical blackbody spectrum still have a significant value ; there is however , in this case , a strong interference in the total spectrum @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ our - result ] ) , due to a change of sign of the function @xmath79 .",
    "such a kind of behavior was found just for cut - off values of the order of @xmath80  @xmath62 . for values of @xmath0 greater than this one",
    "such fluctuations disappear . in any case , this feature confirm our statement that the result can vary sensitively with @xmath0 , contrary to what was sustain by @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 . ]    finally , we have studied the behavior of @xmath81 by varying @xmath66 e @xmath5 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig - surf6 ] .",
    "notice that just the peak of the zero - frequency plasma spectrum depends on @xmath5 ( the blackbody part remains unchanged ) .",
    "indeed , the spectral intensity varies two orders of magnitude by varying @xmath5 by two orders too , namely , it goes from @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , to @xmath84 , for @xmath85 .",
    "thus , our result indicates that , when one goes backwards in time , temperature grows , dynamo action is enhanced ( since @xmath5 goes down ) , and the resonance peak of the zero - frequency plasma peak goes down .     and",
    "in this paper we have computed the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations of an homogeneous cosmic plasma avoiding any approximations .",
    "several different behaviors between our results and the previous one obtained by @xcite , mainly in the low - frequency part of the spectrum , are found and discussed .",
    "it is important to stress that the exact result indicates that the peak of the zero - frequency spectrum can indeed vary sensitively with the cut - off value @xmath86 .    in the light of this new result , and following the papers of @xcite and @xcite , the problem of establishing an upper limit for fractal space dimensionality from cobe data can be revisited .",
    "our results can still be improved towards cosmological applications by computing the fourier transformed volume element @xmath87 in terms of curved riemannian space embedded into general relativistic spacetime .",
    "this will allow us to address the problem of dynamo action in einstein cosmology .",
    "the dynamo effect in plasmas is a competitive effect between convection of the cosmological fluid and the plasma resistivity .",
    "this is the reason why is so interesting to consider the relation between the dynamo action @xmath12 and the plasma resistivity and its frequency . recently ,",
    "some new investigations on this directions were addressed by @xcite , by using the magnetic field correlation tensor in space of negative curvature , and by @xcite in the case of positive curvature .",
    "also recently , @xcite has obtained a constraint on dynamo action from cobe data , using two - dimensional spatial sections of negative curvature of friedmann universe , based on the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equation derived by @xcite .    in near future , by using the formula of @xcite , @xmath88 where @xmath12 is the magnetic field growth rate ( dynamo action ) , we expect to compute @xmath12 in terms of the magnetic plasma resistivity ( @xmath5 ) and plasma frequency ( @xmath4 ) . in this way we shall estimate the variation of dynamo action in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
