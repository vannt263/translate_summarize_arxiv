    "relativistically skewed fe line complex at @xmath66.5 kev is a frequently observed phenomenon in x@xmath12ray spectra of a range of objects @xmath12 from seyfert galaxies @xcite to low mass x@xmath12ray binaries harboring neutron stars and black holes @xcite .",
    "these features reveal the general relativistic nature of these objects and can be used to probe the space - time metric near black holes .",
    "such broad lines have also been reported for galactic x@xmath12ray binaries which harbour either a black hole or a neutron star . among these galactic black hole x@xmath12ray binaries ( bhxbs ) , till now , few transient sources - gro j1655 - 40 @xcite , xte j1550 - 564 @xcite , xte j1650 - 500 @xcite , xte j1752 - 223 @xcite , swift j1753.5 - 0127 @xcite , sax j1711.6 - 3808 @xcite , gx 339 - 4 @xcite and two persistent sources - cyg x-1 @xcite and grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , have shown strong , relativistically broad fe k@xmath13 lines . at lower luminosities , broad iron line has been reported only for two sources gx 339 - 4 @xcite and xte j1650 - 500 @xcite .",
    "bhxbs show a variety of spectral states , each with its distinct timing properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these states have been primarily classified based on the outburst behavior of transient black hole systems with low mass companions i.e. low mass black hole x@xmath12ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "these outbursts which typically last for few months , often trace out a ` q ' shaped figure in the luminosity hardness diagram @xcite .",
    "the outburst starts at right hand bottom part of the diagram , where the source has low luminosity ( l / l@xmath14 @xmath15 0.01 ) and is hard .",
    "then roughly maintaining its hardness ratio , the source increases its luminosity till it reaches near the peak of the outburst ( l / l@xmath14 @xmath16 0.3 ) . from this point , at nearly similar luminosity level , the sources softens , i.e. , it moves horizontally left in the luminosity hardness diagram . from this eddington",
    "limited soft state , the source luminosity decreases as the outburst decays while maintaining its soft nature , till the luminosity falls to roughly @xmath17-@xmath18 times of its eddington value .",
    "from this point onward the source makes a transition from soft to hard state i.e. it moves right in the luminosity hardness diagram . after reaching the hard state",
    "the source luminosity starts dropping further till it reaches its quiescent value ( l / l@xmath14 @xmath6 10@xmath1910@xmath9 ) . broadly speaking , in the soft state ( especially in the low luminosity soft states )",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a standard accretion disk extending to the innermost stable orbit close to the black hole . while in the hard state ( especially in the low luminosity hard state )",
    "the disk emission is weak probably because it is truncated at a large radius away from the black hole and the spectrum is dominated by the hard power - law from an hot inner corona .",
    "now , the origin of relativistically broadened iron line is usually associated with a standard accretion disk extending close to the black hole .",
    "hence its surprising that such lines have been detected during the hard states of gx 339 - 4 and xte j1650 - 500 .",
    "however , in an alternate scenario , it has been observed that the cold material rotating close to central black hole ( e.g. , cyg x@xmath121 ; @xcite ) can be illuminated by the primary power - law photons to give rise the broad iron emission line @xcite .",
    "while the transition from soft to hard occurs at different luminosity levels , no source has ever shown a soft state for luminosities below @xmath20 . at these luminosities ,",
    "all black hole binaries show hard spectrum with very weak disk emission .",
    "black hole systems with high mass companions i.e. high mass x@xmath12ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are typically persistent sources with luminosities ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath21 .",
    "they also show few spectral states which can be broadly classified into hard and soft but not as many as those of the lmxbs .",
    "this is expected since a persistent hmxb varies over a much narrower range of luminosity .",
    "like lmxbs , in the hard state , they show a week disk emission while in the soft state the disk emission is significantly stronger although an extreme soft state , where the disk totally dominates the emission is rarely seen in hmxbs .",
    "hence , hmxbs should also show broad iron lines in the soft state and this is seen , e.g. , in cyg x-1 and also in lmc x-1 .",
    "a fundamental difference between the lmxbs and hmxbs is the presence of a strong wind from the companion and one of the consequences of this wind is the x@xmath12ray irradiation on it can produce emission lines and edges which can appear in the iron line band .",
    "these features carry important information regarding the structure and composition of the wind , but when observed through low spectral resolution instruments , they may lead to improper modeling of the broad iron line originating from the disk .",

    "moreover , the uncertainties in its distance and inclination angle do not allow it to be compared to other black hole systems .",
    "an independent distance analysis is required to understand whether this hmxb , at a certain eddington luminosity ratio , has the same or different spectral shape compared to others .    till the advent of _ nustar _ satellite , _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ suzaku",
    "_ were the only instruments for sensitively measuring broad relativistic fe line although they were highly restricted by their pile - up limit . with its pile - up free operation ( up to @xmath6100 mcrab ) , good calibration and high energy resolution ( @xmath6 400 ev at 0.1@xmath1210 kev ) , _ nustar _ provides a unique opportunity to study relativistically skewed fluorescent line profile accurately and to constrain other features of the reflection component in the 3.0@xmath1279.0 kev energy band @xcite . for example , a 15 ks exposure of grs 1915 + 105 reveals an extremely skewed fe emission line which allowed for an estimation of the black hole spin to be 0.98 @xmath22 0.01 @xcite .",
    "_ nustar _ has already shown promising results regarding detection of lines other than fe k@xmath13 .",
    "for example , fe k@xmath27 line is observed from the compton thick active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xmath12 ngc 424 , ngc 1320 and ic 2560 using both _ xmm - newton _ and _ nustar _",
    "spectra @xcite .",
    "the truly complex nature of the x@xmath12ray spectra in bhxbs are often demonstrated by high resolution spectroscopic instruments and attentions are required while modeling if truly robust information are needed to obtain . for example , reanalysis of the complex _ suzaku _",
    "spectra in the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc 3783 using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation technique shows that the data strongly requires both super@xmath12solar iron abundance as well as rapidly spinning black hole @xcite which was inconclusive from previous attempts that uses conventional methods .",
    "therefore , although the good spectral resolution of _ nustar _ provides a unique opportunity to discern narrow emission lines and edges while simultaneously measuring the broad iron line profile , proper statistical analysis like mcmc simulations of the best@xmath12fit model is needed for the bias - free determination of probable inter - dependent parameters from different model components .",
    "_ nustar _ has observed v4641 sgr twice , once when the source was soft and the other when it was hard .",
    "we analyze these observations along with quasi - simultaneously _ swift _ data .",
    "our motivation is to use the broad band @xmath28-@xmath29 kev data to constrain the disk emission , the hard x@xmath12ray powerlaw , the broad iron line as well as any narrow emission features that may arise from the wind .",

    "we also study signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as a function of channels . around channel number 100 , the snr profile peaks at @xmath65@xmath126 and it falls below 1 at channel numbers less than 10 ( corresponds to the energy @xmath15 3 kev ) and at channel numbers above 230 ( corresponds to the energy @xmath16 11.0 kev ) .",

    "to understand the complexities of the soft state spectra , we used a powerlaw modified by the galactic absorption . throughout our analysis we obtained a galactic absorption column density between 0.2@xmath120.4 @xmath7 10@xmath32 cm@xmath8 which is consistent with previous results @xcite . as it turns out to be that except powerlaw component , two basic components are required : an optically thick , soft blackbody emission which is revealed by a large excess in low energies and strong reflection features , consists of emission lines and edges between 5.8@xmath1210.0 kev .",
    "the large residuals in the high energy region are examined in detail . to highlight the features we show the residuals in the 5@xmath1211 kev band in figure [ residual ] .",
    "visual inspection of the figure suggests several features : ( i ) a broad fe line peaking at @xmath66.9 kev and extending perhaps to @xmath65.5 kev , ( ii ) an emission line - like feature at @xmath6 8.1 kev and ( iii ) an edge at @xmath69.6 kev . with these suggestive features as guidelines",
    "we undertook a systematic analysis of the broad band data .",
    "as compared to a base model of a disk emission and a powerlaw component , a broad iron line is significantly required resulting in a @xmath34 .",
    "we chose the relativistic line model laor @xcite available in xspec to represent the relativistically blurred iron line emission .",
    "this model is parametrized by the line rest frame energy , an emissivity index , inner radii in terms of @xmath35 , inclination angle and normalization .",
    "we fixed the outer radius of the emission to a large value of @xmath36 . like any other complex reflection models , for example ,",
    "_ reflionx _ @xcite and _ relxill _",
    "@xcite which are frequently used to describe complex reflection features ( e.g. , reflection hump at 20@xmath1230 kev ) from the agn spectra in a self@xmath12consistent manner , laor model provides equally good description of the broadening of emission lines due to general relativistic effects .",
    "since we do not have sufficient signal - to - noise ratio at energies @xmath16 15 kev , reflection humps are not detected in the spectra .",
    "therefore , spectral quality do not meet the requirement of applying relativistic reflection models more complex than laor model .    for consistency , we modeled the disk emission using the relativistic disk model kerrd @xcite in xspec .",
    "this disk model uses the same formalism as the laor model to take into account relativistic effects .",
    "the model has convenient parameters such as the black hole mass , which we fixed to the measured value of 6.4 m@xmath23 and a color correction factor which we fixed to the standard value of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the other free parameters are the distance to the source and the accretion rate , inner disk radius and disk inclination angle .",
    "kerrd model assumes a kerr metric around a spinning black hole with spin parameter @xmath38 for which the last stable orbit should be at @xmath39 . a larger inner radii may signify a truncated disk or that the spin parameter is less than what was assumed in the model , a point which we discuss in the last section .",
    "the model consisting of a disk , powerlaw and broad line emissions is not an adequate representation of the high quality data with @xmath40 .",
    "corresponding to broad k@xmath41 , represented by laor model , a k@xmath42 line is expected with the same shape parameter .",
    "the fit significantly improved by the addition of a narrow emission line at @xmath10 kev ( @xmath43 ) and another at @xmath44 kev ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "examination of the residuals showed the presence of an absorption edge at @xmath46 kev ( @xmath47 ) and another one at @xmath48 kev ( @xmath49 ) . in the fitting process previous model components were free to vary while the new one is being fitted .",
    "the best fit parameters for this model are listed in table [ specpar ] and the unfolded spectrum with residuals are shown in figure [ softspec ] . to check the goodness of the fit , we use kolmogorov - smirnov test statistic that uses empirical distribution function ( edf ) and perform goodness of fit monte carlo simulation to check what percentage of these simulations",
    "can reproduce the observed data .",
    "if the model produces the observed spectra , then this value should be around 50% . for each of 10@xmath50 simulations , we use parameter values drawn from best - fit model . for best fit model ,",
    "46% realization is less than best fit statistics while it is very high @xmath16 90% if any of the model component is removed from the best - fit model .",
    "this indicates that the model which has one less component than the current best - fit model can be rejected with 90% confidence . in order to check",
    "whether an empirical comptonization fits better than simple powerlaw , we replace powerlaw model with simpl in xspec .",
    "the simpl model allows to scatter a fraction of seed photons into powerlaw component .",
    "the best fit with simpl returns reduced @xmath51 similar to that with simple powerlaw model with powerlaw index of 1.70@xmath52 and a scattered fraction of 0.011@xmath53 when both up and down scattering are allowed .",
    "therefore , allowing comptonization in stead of simple powerlaw does not affect our results .",
    "the fitting of the soft state spectra allows for an estimation of the distance to the source .",
    "the top left panel of figure [ chiplots ] shows the variation of @xmath54 as a function of distance which illustrates the range of acceptable values .",
    "the normalization of the disk component depends on the distance , the inner radius and the inclination angle . in order to compute @xmath54 variations in parameters ,",
    "we use _ steppar _ in xspec .    in this",
    "fitting , a distance estimate is possible , because the inclination angle and the inner radius are independently constrained being parameters of the relativistic iron line as well as for the relativistic disk emission . it should be emphasized that it is not the iron line alone which determines these two parameters , but",
    "the shape of the relativistically blurred disk emission also helps in constraining their values .",
    "we illustrate this in the top middle panel of figure [ chiplots ] . here",
    "we fit the model by untying the inner radius for the disk and line components i.e. , we allow them to vary independently , but keeping the disk inclination angle of the kerrd model tied to that of laor model while disk inclination angle of laor is kept free .",
    "we run _ steppar _ independently on inner disk radius parameter from kerrd and laor models and the result is shown in the top middle panel of [ chiplots ] .",
    "the figure shows that the variation of @xmath54 as a function of the inner radius obtained from the disk and iron line components provide the similar estimate of the inner radius .",
    "if instead , we fit the model by tying the inner radius of the kerrd model component to that of the laor model component and let the inclination angle parameters from both model components vary independently , we get similar constraints on disk inclination angle from both the components ( by running steppar on disk inclination angle parameters of kerrd and laor model components separately ) .",
    "the result is shown in the top right panel of figure [ chiplots ] ) . during the above exercises of computing @xmath54 variations in disk inclination angle and inner disk radius ,",
    "the distance parameter was allowed to vary during the fitting .",
    "thus , the relativistic nature of the disk emission contributes to the estimation of the inner radius and disk inclination angle .",
    "to check whether relativistic corrections to the emission process is absolutely necessary , we use non@xmath12relativistic , optically thick disk models like diskbb , diskpn and ezdiskbb .",
    "they either provide unusually large reduced @xmath51 ( @xmath16 2 ) or unacceptably high inner disk temperature ( @xmath16 2 kev ) . therefore , relativistic treatment is required by the observed data and the requirement is consistent with both disk emission and line profile measurements .      the use of @xmath51 minimization technique is not always reliable for the determination of model parameters with high significance when large number of free parameters are involved ( for example , our best - fit spectral model has 23 free parameters including model normalization and cross calibration factors ) .",
    "for an independent check on our results , we employ the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations technique for validation of results obtained from @xmath51 minimization technique .",
    "the procedure is following : we proceed fitting the background - subtracted spectra using @xmath51 statistics . since x@xmath12ray spectral counts usually follow poisson distribution , we replace the fit statistic with appropriate statistic for poisson data ( pgstat in xspec ) which assume poisson distribution on source spectral count but gaussian distribution on background counts .",
    "the profile likelihood of pgstat is derived in the same way as the likelihood of c@xmath12statistic is obtained .",
    "while fitting , the distance , disk inclination angle and inner disk radius parameters from kerrd and laor models are kept free to vary . with the new fit statistics , we run 50000 element chains starting from a random perturbation away from best - fit and ignoring first 5000 elements of the chain .",
    "the distribution of the current proposal ( i.e. , an assumed probability distribution for each monte carlo step to run the simulation ) is assumed to be gaussian with the rescaling factor of 0.001 .",
    "the source of the proposal is drawn from the diagonal of the covariance matrix resulting from the fit .",

    "the best fit parameters listed in table [ specpar ] and the unfolded spectrum with residuals are shown in figure @xmath66 ( top and middle panels ) . during the hard state ,",
    "the luminosity was 6.91@xmath67 @xmath7 10@xmath68 ergs / s and the eddington ratio @xmath62 = 7.28@xmath69 @xmath7 10@xmath70 .",
    "the residual plot in the middle panel of [ hardspec ] shows an emission line - like feature at @xmath6 1 kev as well as edge - like feature at @xmath60.4 kev in the xrt spectrum . to account these features , we add an edge and a gaussian line to the best fit model .",
    "the fit improves with @xmath71 and the improved residual is shown at the bottom panel of figure [ hardspec ] . the gaussian feature at @xmath6 1.1 kev has the line width of @xmath15 40 ev ( 3@xmath56 significance ) which is narrower than the instrumental response at that energy .",
    "uncorrelated residual features are also observed at @xmath15 0.5 kev from figure [ residual ] .",
    "these two facts indicate that the observed features are possibly due to calibration uncertainties , rather than real features from a physical process .",
    "additionally , calibration residual at the energy @xmath15 0.5 kev has been observed for _ swift_/xrt window timing ( wt ) mode data . using the best fit model without the low energy edge and narrow gaussian line",
    ", we fit the spectra excluding the energy range 0.3 - 1.2 kev in the _",
    "swift_/xrt band during both soft state and hard state . in doing so",
    ", we do not observe any change in fitted parameter values within error - bars than those reported in table 1 .",
    "reduced @xmath51 is also unaffected by this exercise . therefore , these low energy features do not affect the overall fitting .    during the declining phase of 2004 outburst of v4641 sgr , as the source approached quiescence , _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum in 0.5 - 10.0 kev showed absorption - like depression between 1 - 5 kev @xcite which mimics spectra from typical seyfert-2 galaxies that includes partial covering and distant reflection .",
    "we fitted the same model used by @xcite i.e. tbabs x pcfabs x pexmon to fit the soft state data and find unacceptable reduced @xmath72 , even when we add an extra gaussian model .",
    "for the hard state , the reduced @xmath73 was found to be 1.76 .",
    "thus our analysis shows that for both the soft and hard states the model is not necessary .",
    "the fact that v4641 sgr shows a soft state at such a low eddington ratio makes it unique compared to other black hole systems . to illustrate this we compare it with three well known black hole systems : gx 339@xmath124 , xte j1859 + 226 and xte j1550@xmath12564 by reproducing the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "we have chosen these systems not only because data is available for their various spectral states , but also their black hole masses and distance is similar to that of v4641 sgr ( see table 1 of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for the following analysis , we considered _ rxte _ observations of outbursts of these sources that occurred during march 2002@xmath12may 2003 @xcite , october@xmath12december 1999 @xcite and august 1998@xmath12may 1999 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we fitted each of the observations with a disk emission , power - law and a gaussian line modified by galactic absorption .",
    "we used only the pcu2 of the _ rxte_/pca since it was the best calibrated proportional counter .",
    "we defined luminosity to be in 2 - 80 kev range and hardness ratio ( hr ) as the ratio of the flux between 6.3@xmath1210.5 kev and 3.8@xmath126.3 kev .",
    "the eddington ratio versus hardness obtained from the analysis is shown in figure [ qdiag ] .",
    "the approximate ` q ' shapes obtained from our analysis are consistent with previous analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "10.5 kev and 3.8@xmath126.3 kev ) .",
    "the values are computed using _",
    "rxte_/pca data of outbursts of the low mass bhxbs : xte j1550@xmath12564 ( stars ) , gx 339@xmath124 ( circles ) , xte j1859 + 226 ( triangles ) .",
    "the plot is similar to that obtained by @xcite .",
    "the values for the hard and soft state observations of v4641 sgr using _ nustar _ are plotted using filled red circles .",
    "note that v4641 sgr shows a soft state at a very low eddington ratio @xmath74 . ]    in figure [ qdiag ] , the points corresponding to the hard and soft observations of v4641 sgr are plotted for comparison .",
    "the soft state of v4641 sgr is significantly less luminous when compared to the other three sources .",
    "in fact , it seems , that the position occupied by v4641 sgr in the soft state , has not been observed in any other black hole systems . in the hard state ,",
    "the eddington ratio is @xmath75 , which is close to the ratio value below which black hole systems are considered to be in quiescence @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have performed joint spectral analysis of the high mass bhxb v4641 sgr using observations from _ swift_/xrt and _ nustar _ satellites in the energy range 0.3@xmath1230.0 kev for two different spectral states . while for the lower flux level hard state , the spectrum can be simply described by a power - law and a slight broad iron line , the higher flux soft state reveals complex components that include a power - law , a relativistic disk component , a relativistic broad iron line , two narrow line emission and two edges .    with the 2@xmath56 distance measurement from our analysis ( 10.8@xmath4 kpc )",
    ", one can estimate the upper and lower limit of eddington fraction for the soft state to be @xmath62 = 12.07 @xmath22 0.87 @xmath7 10@xmath9 and 5.74 @xmath22 0.33 @xmath7 10@xmath9 respectively . the upper limit and lower limit of @xmath62",
    "are estimated using upper and lower limit of distances which are 12.4 kpc and 8.3 kpc respectively .",
    "it is important to note that if the actual distance is lower than 8 kpc , then l@xmath76 luminosity will diminish . as a consequence",
    ", l@xmath76/l@xmath77 will be lower .",
    "such a low @xmath62 fraction for a soft disk dominated state is rare and matched closely with that observed from xte j1859 + 226 . in the eddington ratio hardness plot , bhxbs typically form a ` q ' diagram and the soft state of v4641 sgr is located at a position which can be considered as the lowest limit of three other typical bhxb systems as observed from figure [ qdiag ] . for a typical bhxb , the hard to soft transition occurs for @xmath78 and the reverse occurs when @xmath79 .",
    "this itself suggests that the spectral state of a bhxb is not just a function of the accretion rate but also depends on how the overall accretion rate is changing with time . in one interpretation of the soft to hard transition",
    ", a standard optically thick disk evaporates into a hot optically thin one @xcite and perhaps the rapid variability of the source does not allow for the evaporation to take place .",
    "such speculations require sophisticated theoretical modeling for confirmation and more deep observations of this source at different flux levels are required to understand its temporal behavior .    the inner disk radius during the soft state is found to be @xmath80 .",
    "if identified with the last stable orbit of a disk , this would suggest that the black hole has a moderate spin .",
    "however , we note that both the _ laor _ and _ kerrd _ spectral models used for the disk and line emissions , assume an extremal spin of @xmath81 and hence the actual value of the inner radius maybe different if the spin is moderate . a more general prescription which takes into different spin values of the black hole maybe used to fit the disk emission as has been done for some black hole systems @xcite . in such a analysis",
    ", one should also consider more realistic color factors than the universal @xmath37 assumed in this work .",
    "however such analysis has been undertaken on good quality clean data where the power - law component is very weak i.e. @xmath1510% .",
    "nevertheless , it will be interesting to see whether the spin of the black hole can be constrained using sophisticated spectral models , an analysis which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "it is important to explore the role of strong wind from the companion star in explaining observed features in the spectra .",
    "optical depth of ni edge is during the soft state observation is found to be unusually large and vary significantly while transiting from the soft state to the hard state ( e.g. , for the absorption edge at @xmath69 kev , @xmath82 increases from @xmath6 0.22 to @xmath6 0.47 ) .",
    "secondly , during the soft state , two narrow emission lines and edges are clearly detected in the spectrum .",
    "since the lines are narrow , they should arise from regions far from the black hole .",
    "therefore , the presence of highly ionized wind from the disk / binary companion seems to be a natural origin .",
    "the emission line at @xmath10 kev can be identified due to ionized iron in the x@xmath12ray irradiated wind .",
    "the emission line at @xmath83 kev is more uncertain .",
    "the line energy suggests that it could arise due to highly ionized nickel as can be seen in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of wind need to be investigated carefully . a relationship between the kinetic power of the wind ( per unit filling factor , c@xmath84 ) and the bolometric luminosity , log(l@xmath85/c@xmath84 ) = 1.58@xmath220.07 log(l@xmath86 ) - 3.19@xmath220.19 , is obtained by @xcite by studying the _ chandra _ grating spectra across black hole mass scale @xmath12 from bhxbs to agns .",
    "if the above relationship is true for v4641 sgr , than using the bolometric luminosity for the soft spectral state in our analysis , we obtain log(l@xmath85/c@xmath84 ) = -2.46 which significantly deviates from the value observed for canonical bhxbs and consistent with low ionization . in order to produce large optical depth of edges , circumstellar wind from the binary companion in v4641 sgr",
    "need to be very strong . from the observation ,",
    "the mass of the binary companion of v4641 sgr is found out to be 2.9 @xmath22 0.4 m@xmath23 which is a reddened b9iii star with relatively low rotational velocity ( v@xmath87sin_i _ = 100.9 @xmath22 0.08 km / s ) .",
    "the measured velocity is lower than the predicted minimum threshold for launching highly ionized stellar wind ( v@xmath87sin_i _ of 150@xmath12200 km / s from the uv survey of 40 b - type stars covering luminosity classes v - iii @xcite ) .",
    "secondly from the spectroscopic study , the possibility of radiation driven wind from the surface of the companion star can be ruled out since the surface temperature of the companion star in v4641 sgr is derived to be 10250 @xmath22 300 k @xcite which is relatively low and not hot enough to produce an effective radiation driven wind .",
    "this indicates that the possibility of very strong wind in this source may not be the only explanation of observed features .",
    "it is suggestive that multiple and strong emission lines and absorption edges , even at hard state may possibly indicate the over - abundance of elements like fe ( a@xmath88 @xmath16 2 ) present in the spectra .",
    "however , high resolution grating spectroscopy using _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ during soft state in v4641 sgr may provide compelling evidence for any possible nature of disk wind in this source .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the galactic jet source ss 433 , the ni over - abundance by a factor of 20 @xcite and high disk inclination angle causes the visibility of ni emission line in the spectra @xcite and nickel emission lines are expected from ionized medium surrounding active galactic nuclei @xcite . a detailed work focusing on the physics of the x@xmath12ray irradiated wind",
    "is required to understand the narrow emission lines and edges seen in v4641 sgr .",
    "although , there does not seem to be any issues regarding _ nustar _ calibration during these observations , it would be perhaps be prudent to reconfirm these emission lines with a second observation by _ nustar _ during similar spectral state or by other high resolution instruments .",
    "we thank the referee for useful discussions and comments .",
