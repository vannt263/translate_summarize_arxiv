    "the vast majority of white dwarfs evolve from normal main - sequence stars following normal evolutionary processes .",
    "however , ultramassive ( @xmath5 ) and inframassive ( @xmath6 ) white dwarfs require special evolutionary paths .",
    "the formation of low - mass helium white dwarfs ( @xmath7 ) has been shown to be the result of close binary evolution ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the galaxy is not old enough for these objects to have formed through single star evolution .",
    "the general evolutionary scenario for the formation of low - mass helium white dwarfs is that the companion stripped the white dwarf of its envelope before completing its red giant evolution @xcite .",
    "recently , several very low mass white dwarfs ( @xmath8 ) have been discovered as companions to pulsars @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods vary from a few hours to several years .",
    "the masses of some of these white dwarfs may be determined from the shapiro delay of radio pulses provided that the system is nearly edge on @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite deduced a mass of @xmath9 for the companion of psr j1909@xmath103744 , and obtained a spectrum which confirmed , at least qualitatively , the presence of a low mass da white dwarf .",
    "in addition , the masses of the companions to psr j1012@xmath115307 and psr j1911@xmath105958 were determined spectroscopically to be @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite , respectively .",
    "finally , several low - mass white dwarf candidates were found in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the brightest star in the sample , sdss  j123410.37@xmath10022802.9 and showed that it has a mass of @xmath14 and that it does not have an obvious neutron star companion .    in this paper , we report the identification of a high velocity white dwarf with a very low mass , lp  400 - 22 ( wd2234 + 222 , nltt  54331 ) .",
    "our photometric and spectroscopic observations are presented in  2.1 and 2.2 respectively .",
    "we derive the stellar parameters in  3 and discuss our results in  4 .",
    "lp  400 - 22 was spectroscopically identified as a white dwarf as part of a survey of common - proper motion binaries with suspected white dwarf components @xcite .",
    "we obtained additional high - resolution optical spectra @xcite as well as new optical photometry @xcite as part of the same project .",
    "more recently , lp  400 - 22 was observed during the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) all - sky survey .",
    "the @xmath15 photometry for lp  400 - 21/22 were obtained with the 2.1 m telescope at kpno on 1995 july 5 ut . a tek1k ccd ( with @xmath16 m pixels ) operating at the cassegrain focus was used , providing @xmath17 per pixel and a @xmath18 field of view .",
    "the data for lp  400 - 21/22 were obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "standard stars for this program were chosen from @xcite .",
    "we obtained ultraviolet ( uv ) photometry from _ galex _ all - sky survey .",
    "_ galex _ provides photometry in two bands , fuv and nuv , which are based on the ab system @xcite .",

    "we obtained a low - resolution spectrum of lp  400 - 22 using the r - c spectrograph attached to the 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) on 1988 october 6 .",
    "the bl250 grating ( 158 lines / mm ) was used to obtain a spectral range of 3500 to 6200   with a dispersion of 5.52   per pixel and a resolution of 14  .",
    "lp  400 - 22 was re - observed using the dual imaging spectrogram ( dis ) attached to the 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ) on 2001 july 10 and october 14 .",
    "the 1200 lines / mm grating was used to obtain a spectral range of 3800 to 4600   with a dispersion of 1.6   per pixel , and the 830.8 lines / mm grating was used to obtain a spectral range of 6180 to 7210   with a dispersion of 1.3   per pixel .",
    "a @xmath31 slit was used to obtain a spectral resolution of @xmath32   in the blue and @xmath33   in the red .",
    "in our analysis of lp  400 - 22 , we used a grid of computed pure hydrogen lte plane parallel models ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "the grid of models extend from @xmath34 to 16000 k ( in steps of 1000 k ) , from 18000 to 32000 k ( in steps of 2000 k ) and from 36000 to 84000 k ( in steps of 4000 k ) at @xmath35 to 9.5 ( in steps of 0.25 dex ) .",
    "all our @xmath36 values are in cgs .",
    "we also prepared corresponding grids of synthetic spectra , one of which includes the effect of ly@xmath37 satellites @xcite , and the other excludes that effect .      using our spectral grid , we have calculated synthetic optical ( @xmath15 ) and ultraviolet ( @xmath38 ) colors .",
    "figure  [ fig_vmf_fmn ] shows the observed photometric colors ( @xmath39 versus @xmath40 and @xmath41 versus @xmath42 ) of lp  400 - 22 compared to synthetic white dwarf and main - sequence colors .",
    "we used kurucz synthetic spectra @xcite to calculate our main - sequence colors .    in the uv - optical diagram ( @xmath39/@xmath40 ) of figure  [ fig_vmf_fmn ]",
    "we show two sets of wd synthetic colors .",
    "the grid shown in black includes the effect of ly@xmath37 satellites @xcite as compared to the grid in green which excludes them .",
    "a comparison of the two grids shows the significant effect that the ly@xmath37 satellites have on the uv colors at @xmath43 k. comparing the uv - optical photometry of lp  400 - 22 to the white dwarf grid , a low surface gravity @xmath44 and an effective temperature of @xmath45 k is implied .",
    "the optical diagram ( @xmath41/@xmath42 ) in figure  [ fig_vmf_fmn ] confirms the white dwarf temperature of 11000 k and the low surface gravity",
    ".    however , when comparing the photometry to main - sequence colors , a a3v spectral type is implied in the optical and a b8v spectral type in the ultraviolet . therefore , the data are incompatible with main - sequence colors .",
    "optical and uv colors are useful to distinguish white dwarfs from main - sequence stars .",
    "the balmer lines of lp  400 - 22 were analyzed in all three available spectra using a @xmath46 minimization technique .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are statistical only ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the balmer lines ( h@xmath48 to h9 ) in the kpno spectrum were fitted with model spectra which were smoothed to the instrumental resolution of 14  , to obtain @xmath49 k and @xmath50 .",
    "for the two high - resolution apo spectra we fitted h@xmath37 and h@xmath51 to h9 with model spectra , to obtain @xmath52 k and @xmath53 k , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the synthetic spectra used in the analysis of the apo spectra were smoothed with a gaussian profile to the instrumental resolution of 2  .",
    "note that the disprepancy in the surface gravities from the 2 apo spectra are most likely the result of uncertainties in the flux calibration around the higher balmer lines .",
    "the balmer line fit of the kpno spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig_specfit_wd2234 + 222 ] .",
    "these measurements clearly confirm that lp  400 - 22 is a white dwarf with a low surface gravity .",
    "the calculated weighted average of the temperature and surface gravity is @xmath56 k and @xmath1 .",
    "we used the evolutionary tracks for helium - core white dwarfs of @xcite and @xcite to determine a mass of @xmath57 and a cooling age of @xmath58 years .",
    "note that the cooling age of the white dwarf is sensitive to the mass of the hydrogen envelope left before entering the final cooling track ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "residual h - burning in a thick h - envelope causes the white dwarf to cool slower as compared to a white dwarf with a thin h - envelope .",
    "the temperature of 11080 k places lp  400 - 22 near the blue edge of the zz ceti instability strip @xcite . given the lack of time coverage in our data , we can not state whether the star is variable or not .",
    "time - series photometry is required to explore variability and place constraints on the blue edge of the instability strip at the low - mass range .",
    "lp  400 - 22 was listed in the new luyten two - tenths ( nltt ) catalog @xcite to have a common proper motion companion ( lp  400 - 21 ) @xmath59 away .",
    "recently , @xcite have revised the coordinates and proper motions of most stars in the nltt catalog by cross - correlating the catalog with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the usno - a catalogs .",
    "however lp  400 - 22 was not detected in 2mass , and therefore they relisted luyten s measurement of the proper motion .",
    "they listed the proper motion of lp  400 - 22 to be @xmath60 yr@xmath4 and @xmath61 yr@xmath4 .",
    "for lp  400 - 21 they measured a proper motion of @xmath62 yr@xmath4 and @xmath63 yr@xmath4 .",
    "these proper motion measurements agree within @xmath64 and on this basis the two stars appear to be a common proper motion binary . however , similar measurements were reported by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath65 yr@xmath4 and @xmath66 yr@xmath4 for lp  400 - 22 , and @xmath67 yr@xmath4 @xmath68 yr@xmath4 for lp  400 - 21 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in the @xcite measurements are @xmath69 yr@xmath4 and , therefore , the diverging proper motions of the two stars appears to exclude a physical association .",
    "another way to check whether the stars are a physical binary is to determine the distance of each star .    to estimate the distance , we calculated an absolute magnitude of @xmath70 mag for lp  400 - 22 and a distance modulus @xmath71 mag .",
    "this places the white dwarf at a distance of @xmath72 pc .",
    "note that the galactic extinction for this object is low and its effect was not included .",
    "@xcite classified lp  400 - 21 a dm4.5e , and using the @xmath73 relation from @xcite we estimate the absolute magnitude of the red dwarf as 12.7 mag .",
    "the apparent v magnitude for lp  400 - 21 is @xmath74 mag , and , therefore , the red dwarf is at a distance of @xmath75 pc .",
    "@xcite note a scatter of values about the relation with @xmath76 .",
    "even if we consider lp  400 - 21 at the extrema of this dispersion , it would place it at a distance of only @xmath77 pc .",
    "the large distance discrepancy makes lp  400 - 22/21 a coincidental pair rather then a wide binary as has been thought based on their proper motion alone .",
    "the large distance and high - proper motion of lp  400 - 22 imply a large tangential velocity of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "only a few white dwarfs are known to have @xmath78 km s@xmath4 , with most of these having halo space velocities @xcite . in order to obtain the @xmath79 space velocity components for lp  400 - 22 , we measured the radial velocity of the white dwarf using h@xmath37 in the apo high - dispersion spectra to obtain a heliocentric value of @xmath80 km s@xmath4 , which is different than the velocity measured for the red dwarf ( 7.3 km s@xmath4 ) by @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath79 for lp  400 - 22 using @xcite to obtain @xmath81 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these velocity components do not agree with either disk or halo populations @xcite and suggest a different origin for its peculiar motion .",
    "the galactic orbit for lp  400 - 22 should be calculated .",
    "most white dwarfs with @xmath82 are companions to pulsars .",
    "we searched for radio sources in the vicinity of lp  400 - 22 using _ vizier _ , and the nearest was that of the galaxy kug2234 + 223 @xmath83 away . therefore ,",
    "if lp  400 - 22 is a companion to a neutron star , then it is probably a dead pulsar .",
    "another possibility is that lp  400 - 22 has a very cool companion , which should be detectable as infrared excess .",
    "however , lp  400 - 22 was not detected by 2mass .",
    "the two high - dispersion velocity measurements agree within error bars .",
    "however , a series of radial velocity measurements should be obtained to establish whether or not lp  400 - 22 is in a close binary system .",
    "yet another possibility for the origin of lp  400 - 22 is that it may have once been in a close double - degenerate binary , where the companion has gone through a supernova event that disrupted the binary losing the remnant of the donor star with a high - velocity and a low mass @xcite .",

    "must have been formed in close binary systems , radial velocity measurements and infrared photometry are required to determine whether lp  400 - 22 has a close companion . on the other hand , a lack of radial velocity variations would indicate that lp  400 - 22 lost its close massive companion following a type ia supernova event .",
