    "over the last decade , several laboratories in the world have been working on linear  collider projects with an energy from several hundreds gev up to several tev : these are nlc(usa )  @xcite , jlc(japan )  @xcite , tesla(europe )  @xcite , clic ( cern )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the  physics program , linear colliders provide a unique opportunity to study  and interactions at energies and luminosities comparable to those in  collisions  @xcite .",
    "high energy photons for ,  collisions can be obtained using compton backscattering of laser light off the high energy electrons .",
    "the basic scheme of a photon collider is shown in fig .",
    "[ ggcol ] .",
    "two electron beam of energy @xmath1 after the final focus system travel towards the interaction point ( ip ) and at a distance @xmath2 of about 0.10.5 cm from the ip collide with the focused laser beam .",
    "after scattering , the photons have an energy close to that of the initial electrons and follow their direction to the interaction point ( ip ) ( with some small additional angular spread of the order of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ) , where they collide with a similar opposite high energy photons or electrons . using a laser flash energy of several joules one can `` convert '' almost all electrons to high energy photons .",
    "the photon spot size at the ip will be almost equal to that of the electron at the ip would have and therefore the luminosity of ,  collisions will be of the same order as the `` geometric '' luminosity of the basic beams . to avoid background from the disrupted beams ,",
    "a crab crossing scheme is used ( fig.1b ) .",
    "the maximum energy of the scattered photons is @xmath5 \\left[\\frac{\\omega_0}{ev}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the electron beam energy , @xmath6 the energy of the laser photon , @xmath7 is the angle between electron and laser beam ( see , fig.[ggcol]a ) .",
    "for example : @xmath1 = 250 gev , @xmath8 ev ( @xmath9 , nd : glass and other powerful solid state lasers ) we obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    for increasing values of @xmath12 the high energy photon spectrum becomes more peaked .",
    "however , at @xmath13 the high energy photons are lost due to  creation in the collisions with laser photons  @xcite .",
    "the optimum laser wave length @xmath14 \\sim 4e_0[{\\mbox{tev}}\\ ] .$ ] so , for  collisions the maximum energy is @xmath15 and in collisions @xmath16 . for an introduction to photon",
    "colliders see refs  @xcite , and introductory talks at this workshop  @xcite .    below most important issues connected with a photon collider based on the tesla  linear collider",
    "are discussed .",
    "tesla is the superconducting linear collider on the c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath17 gev , with the possibility of upgrading up to 800 gev . in comparison with other projects based on `` normal '' conducting structures tesla",
    "has several advantages : higher rf efficiency and correspondingly higher possible luminosity ; much larger distance between bunches which makes readout and background problems much easier .",
    "larger aperture of the accelerating structure ( and correspondingly smaller wake fields ) allows bunches with very small emittances to be accelerated without emittance dilution .",
    "all this makes the tesla project very attractive .",
    "many european high - energy physicists consider tesla as the next after lhc project . now",
    "intensive work is going on both on accelerator , physics and detector with the intent to submit technical design report ( tdr ) in spring 2001 .    beside  collisions in tesla project a second interaction region for  and  collision",
    "is foreseen  @xcite .",
    "it is very important to include in the basic design of the collider all that is necessary for a photon collider : special interaction region with the crab crossing , minimization of beam emittances and their preservation along the lc , space for lasers and laser optics , beam dump etc .",
    "this work is underway .",
    "detector for ,  collisions may be very similar to that for  collision , though with some complication connected with the focusing mirrors optics which should be placed inside the detector .",
    "the most important key element of the photon collider is a laser system with very unique parameters .",
    "development of the laser system is currently the highest priority : `` to be or not to be '' for photon colliders will be determined by the success of this laser r&d .    below",
    "i will briefly discuss the following essential topics :    1 .",
    "physics motivation ; 2 .",
    "possible parameters of the photon collider at tesla ; 3 .",
    "lasers , optics ; 4 .   backgrounds and some other issues .",
    "physics motivation for photon colliders is a very important issue .",
    "the next linear  collider should give some new information after lhc , photon colliders should give something new ( or better accuracy ) in addition to .",
    "in general , physics in  and ,  collisions is quite similar because the same particles can be produced .",
    "however , it is always better to study new phenomena in various reactions because they give complementary information .",
    "some phenomena can best be studied at photon colliders due to better accuracy or larger accessible masses .",
    "the second aspect important for physics motivation is the luminosity .",
    "typical luminosity distribution in  and  collisions has a high energy peak and some low energy part ( see the next section ) .",
    "this peak in  collisions has a width at half maximum of about 15% .",
    "the photons in the peak can have a high degree of polarization . in the next section",
    "it will be shown that in the current tesla designs the   luminosity in the high energy peak can be up to 30 - 40% of the  luminosity at the same beam energy .",
    "the present standard model ( sm ) assumes existence of a very unique particle , the higgs boson , which is thought to be responsible for the origin of particle masses .",
    "it has not been found yet , but from existing experimental information it follows that , if it exists , its mass is higher then 112 gev ( lep200 ) and is below 200 gev  @xcite , i.e. lays in the region of the next linear colliders . in the simplest extensions to the sm",
    "the higgs sector consists of five physics states : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "all these particles can be studied at photon colliders and some characteristics can be measured better than in  collisions .",
    "the process @xmath20 goes via the loop with heavy virtual charged particles and its cross section is very sensitive to the contribution of particles with masses far beyond the energies covered by present and planned accelerators  @xcite .",
    "if the higgs is light enough , its width is much less than the energy spread in  collisions .",
    "the `` effective '' cross section with account of the energy spread is presented in fig.[cross ]  @xcite .",
    "[ cross ]    here  is defined as the  luminosity at the high energy peak of the luminosity spectrum . for comparison ,",
    "the cross sections of the higgs production in  collisions are shown .",
    "we see that for @xmath21 120250 gev the effective cross section in  collisions is larger than the sum of the cross sections in  collisions by a factor of about 8.530 .",
    "the higgs boson at photon colliders can be detected as a peak in the invariant mass distribution or(and ) can be searched for by scanning the energy using the sharp high energy edge of the luminosity distribution  @xcite . for the integrated luminosity 50 fb@xmath22 ( in the peak )",
    "the number of produced higgs will be 50150 thousands ( depending on the mass ) .    at @xmath23",
    "gev the higgs decays mainly to b - quarks .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 ) .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath26 can be measured with a high precision in  collisions in the process with the `` tagged '' higgs production : @xmath27  @xcite . as a result",
    ", one can measure the @xmath28 width at photon colliders with an accuracy better than 23%  @xcite .",
    "this is sufficient for distinguishing between higgs models @xcite .",
    "moreover in the models with several neutral higgs bosons , heavy h@xmath29 and a@xmath29 bosons have almost equal masses and for wide range of parameters are produced in  collisions only in associated production @xmath30 @xcite , while in  collision they can be produced singly with sufficiently high cross section  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , in  collisions one can produce higgs bosons with about 1.5 times higher masses .",
    "the second example is the charged pair production .",
    "it could be @xmath31 or @xmath32 pairs or some new , for instance , charged higgs bosons or supersymmetric particles .",
    "cross sections for the production of charged scalar , lepton , ww pairs in  collisions are larger than those in  collisions by a factor of approximately 520 .",
    "the corresponding graphs can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    for scalar particle ,",
    "the cross section in  and   collisions is presented in fig.[crossel ]  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the cross section in collisions of polarized photons for large masses ( near the threshold ) is higher than that in  collisions by a factor of 20 .",
    "in addition , near the threshold the cross section in the  collisions is very sharp , @xmath33 ( while in  it contains a factor @xmath34 ) ; this is useful for measurements of particle masses .",
    "[ crossel ]    note , that in  collisions two charged pairs are produced both via annihilation diagram with virtual @xmath35 , @xmath36 and also via exchange diagrams where some new particles can give contributions , while in  collisions it is pure a qed process which allows the charge of produced particles to be measured unambiguously .",
    "this is a good example of complementarity in the study of the same particles in different types of collisions .      in  collisions ,",
    "charged particle with a mass higher than that in  collisions can be produced ( a heavy charged particle plus a light neutral ) ; for example , supersymmetric charged particle plus neutralino or new w boson and neutrino .",
    "also ,  collisions provide higher accessible masses for particles which are produced as a single resonance in  collisions ( such as neutral higgs bosons ) .",
    "precise measurement of cross sections allow the observation of effects of anomalous interactions .",
    "the process @xmath37 ww has large cross section ( about 80 pb ) and it is one of most sensitive processes for a search for a new physics ( if no new particles are observed directly ) .",
    "the vertex @xmath38 can be studied much better than in   collisions because in the latter case the cross section is much smaller and this vertex gives only 10% contribution to the total cross section .",
    "the two factors together give about 40 times difference in the cross sections  @xcite .",
    "besides that , in  collisions the @xmath39 vertex can be studied .",
    "this new theory  @xcite suggests a possible explanation of why gravitation forces are so weak in comparison with electroweak forces .",
    "it is suggested that the gravitation constant is equal to the electroweak but in a space with extra dimensions .",
    "this extravagant theory can be tested at photon colliders and a two times higher mass scale than in   collisions can be reached  @xcite .",
    "many other examples can be found in these proceedings .",
    "as it is well known in  collisions the luminosity is restricted by beamstrahlung and beam instabilities . due to the first effect",
    "the beams should be very flat . in  collisions",
    "these effects are absent , therefore one can use beams with much smaller cross section . limitations of the luminosity at photon colliders are discussed in section 3.2 . at present tesla beam parameters",
    "the  luminosity is determined only by the attainable geometric  luminosity .",
    "below we consider first currently possible luminosity and then fundamental limitations .",
    "what luminosity can be obtained with the technology presently available ?",
    "it depends on emittances of electron beams .",
    "there are two methods of production low - emittance electron beams : damping rings and low - emittance rf - photo - guns ( without damping rings ) .",
    "the second option is promising , but at this moment there are no such photo - guns producing polarized electron beams  @xcite .",
    "polarization of electron beams is very desirable for photon colliders  @xcite , because : a ) it increases the luminosity in the high energy peak by a factor of 34 ; b ) polarization characteristics of high energy photons are better ( broader part of spectrum have high degree of polarization ) .",
    "so , there is only one choice now  damping rings .    especially for a photon collider",
    "the possibility of decreasing the beam emittances at the tesla damping ring has been studied and preliminary results were reported at the workshop  @xcite . after some additional study it was found that the horizontal emittance can be reduced by a factor of 4 compared to the previous design .",
    "now the normalized horizontal emittance is @xmath40 m.    the luminosity depends also on @xmath41-functions at the interaction points : @xmath42 .",
    "the vertical @xmath43 is usually chosen close to the bunch length @xmath44 ( this is in design for  collisions and can be done for  collisions as well ) .",
    "some questions remain on the minimum horizontal @xmath41-function . for  collisions , @xmath45 mm which is much larger than the bunch length @xmath46 mm , because beams in  collisions must be flat to reduce beamstrahlung . in collisions , @xmath47 could be about 1 mm ( or even somewhat smaller ) .",
    "there are two fundamental limitations : the beam length and the oide effects  @xcite ( radiation in final quads ) , the latter is not important for considered beam parameters .",
    "there is also a cetrain problem with the angular spread of the synchrotron radiation emitted in the final quads .",
    "but , for the photon collider the crab - crossing scheme will be used and in this case there is sufficient clearence for the removal of the disrupted beams and synchrotron radiation .",
    "very preliminary studies of the existing scheme of the tesla final focus have shown  @xcite that chromo - geometric abberations dominate at @xmath47 less than about 6 mm . however , this value is not fundamental limitation and it is very likely that after further study and optimization a better solution will be found .",
    "recently , at slac a new scheme for the final focus system has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the first check without optimization has shown  @xcite that with the new scheme one can obtain @xmath48 1.52 mm with small abberations . in this paper @xmath49 mm",
    "is assumed .",
    "some uncertainties remain also for operation of tesla at low energies . for the low mass higgs ( m@xmath50 = 130 gev ) the required electron beam energy lies between 79 gev ( for @xmath51 , @xmath52  ) and 100 gev ( for @xmath53 , @xmath9  ) . in this case",
    "tesla should work at lowered accelerating gradient or use bypass .",
    "if one use the same electron bunches , the same beam - train structure and the repetition rate , the luminosity will be proportional to the beam energy @xmath1 ( because @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .    in principle , this loss of luminosity can be compensated by increase of the repetition rate as @xmath57 , it this case the rf power ( for linac ) is constant .",
    "however , for the present design of the tesla damping ring , the repetition rate may be increased at most by a factor of 2 .",
    "further decrease of the damping time is possible but at additional cost ( wigglers , rf - power ) .",
    "other problem of working at low gradients is the beam loading problem ( rf efficiency ) .",
    "its adjustment requires change of a coupler position , which is technically very difficult or even impossible .    due to these uncertainties",
    "tesla accelerator physicists have recommended to use the scaling @xmath58 ( bypass solution ) .",
    "however , if the low mass higgs is found , some solutions for increasing luminosity at low energies can be found .",
    "for this paper i assume the same beam parameters for all energies , that gives @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting parameters of the photon collider at tesla for @xmath59 gev and h(130 ) are presented in table 1 .",
    "it is assumed that electron beams have 85% longitudinal polarization and laser photons have 100% circular polarization .",
    "the thickness of laser target is one collision length ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the conversion point ( cp ) is situated at the distance @xmath61 from the interaction point .",
    "[ table1 ]    comparing the  luminosity with the  luminosity ( @xmath62  for @xmath59 gev @xcite ) we see that for the same energy @xmath63    the relation ( [ lgge+e- ] ) is valid only for the considered beam parameters .",
    "a more universal relation is ( for @xmath64 ) @xmath65    for example , as we have seen ( fig.[crossel ] ) the cross section for production of @xmath66 pairs in collisions of polarized photons is higher than that in  collisions by a factor of 20 ( not far from the threshold ) ; this means 8 times higher production rate for the luminosities given above .    for the higgs",
    "the production rate is proportional to @xmath67 at @xmath68 . for the considered cases , @xmath69 gev , @xmath51 and @xmath53 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , so that the coefficient in fig.[cross ] characterizing the width of the peak is about 5.9 and 5.5 ( instead of 7 ) .    using these luminosities and fig .",
    "[ cross ] one can find that the rate of production of the sm higgs boson with m@xmath50=130(160 ) gev in  collisions is 0.9(3 ) of that in  collisions at @xmath17 gev ( both reactions , zh and h@xmath72 ) .",
    "the normalized  luminosity spectra for @xmath17 gev are shown in fig.[ldist250 ] .",
    "[ ldist250 ]    [ ldist250e ]    the luminosity spectrum is decomposed into two parts , with the total helicity of two photons 0 and 2 .",
    "we see that in the high energy part of the luminosity spectra photons have a high degree of polarization .",
    "in addition to the high energy peak , there is a factor 58 larger low energy luminosity .",
    "it is produced mainly by photons after multiple compton scattering and beamstrahlung photons .",
    "these events have a large boost and can be easily distinguished from the central high energy events . in the same fig.[ldist250 ] you can see the same spectrum with an additional cut on the longitudinal momentum of the produced system which suppresses low energy luminosity to a low level . for",
    "two jet events ( @xmath73 , for example ) one can restrict the longitudinal momentum using the acollinearity angle between jets .",
    "the resulting energy spread of collisions will be about 7.5 % , see fig.[ldist250 ] ( lower ) .",
    "the high energy part of the  luminosity spectrum is almost independent on collision effects at the ip ( beamstrahlung and multiple compton scattering ) . for theoretical studies one can obtain it with sufficient accuracy by convolution of the compton function  @xcite .",
    "recently , a simple analytical formula for the compton function has been obtained  @xcite which takes into account nonlinear effects in the conversion region for small enough values of @xmath74 . at photon colliders",
    "it is about 0.20.3 in the center of the laser focus . in the simulation one",
    "has also to take into account variation of @xmath74 in the conversion region .",
    "as a good approximation one can generate `` t '' distributed by the gaussian law and then calculate @xmath75 .",
    "the normalized  luminosity spectra for @xmath59 gev are shown in fig.[ldist250e ] . again , beside the high energy peak there is a several times larger  luminosity at low invariant masses .",
    "note , that  luminosity in the high energy peak is not a simple geometric characteristic of the compton scattering ( as it is in   collisions ) .",
    "for the considered case it is suppressed by a factor of 23 , mainly due to repulsion of the electron beams and beamstrahlung .",
    "the suppression factor depends strongly on beam parameters .",
    "note , that for a special experiment on qcd study at low luminosity one can increase the distance between the conversion and interaction points and obtain very monochromatic  luminosity spectrum with a small low energy background .",
    "this is due to the effective transverse magnetic field in the detector solenoid which acts on the beam in the case the crab crossing collisions .",
    "the luminosity distributions for the case of higgs ( 130 gev ) are presented in fig.[higgs130 ] .",
    "all parameters for this figure are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "two cases are considered : @xmath76 gev , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 = 0.325  ) and @xmath79 gev , @xmath53 ( @xmath78 = 1.06 , which corresponds to wave lengths of the most power solid state lasers ) .",
    "[ higgs130 ]    beside the convenience of using the same laser with @xmath80 1   for all energies there are two other advantages of the latter case . for measurement of the higgs bosons",
    "cp parity a linear polarization of high energy photons is required  @xcite .",
    "maximum value of the linear polarization is @xmath81 @xcite , it is 63.3 % for @xmath53 and only 33.5 % for @xmath82 .",
    "second advantage of @xmath53 are smaller disruption angles of the beams after collisions , see table [ table1 ] . the disruption angle and the angular size of the first quadrupole determine the value of the crab crossing angle ( fig.[ggcol ] ) . in the present design @xmath83 mrad ( angle between electron beams ) .",
    "it may be not sufficient for collisions of 80 gev electron beams and @xmath51 .",
    "one can use here @xmath84  or @xmath85  ( doubled frequency ) .",
    "several other important accelerator aspects of the photon collider at tesla are discussed in n.  walker s talk at this workshop  @xcite .",
    "there is only one collision effect restricting the  luminosity , that is a process of coherent pair creation when the high energy photon is converted into an  pair in the strong field of the opposing electron beam  @xcite . in  collisions , beside coherent pair creation ,",
    "two other effects are important : beamstrahlung ( electrons of the `` main '' electron beam radiate in the field of the electron beam used for photon production ) and repulsion of beams .",
    "below are results of simulations with the code which takes into account all main processes in beam - beam interactions  @xcite .",
    "fig.[sigmax ] shows dependence of the  ( solid curves ) and  ( dashed curves ) luminosities on the horizontal beam size for tesla beam parameters at several energies .",
    "[ sigmax ]    the horizontal beam size was varied by change of horizontal beam emittance keeping the horizontal beta function at the ip constant and equal to 1.5 mm .",
    "one can see that all curves for  luminosity follow their natural behavior : @xmath86 ( values @xmath87 nm are not considered because too small horizontal sizes may have problems with crab - crossing ) .",
    "note that in  collisions @xmath88 nm . in  collisions",
    "the luminosity is lower than in  collisions due to the displacement of the electron beam during the beam collision and beamstrahlung .",
    "so , we can conclude that for  collisions at tesla one can use beams with a horizontal beam size down to 10 nm ( maybe even smaller ) which is much smaller than that in  collisions .",
    "note , that the vertical beam size could also be additionally decreased by a factor of two ( for even smaller electron beam size the effective photon beam size will be determined by the compton scattering contribution ) . as a result ,",
    "the  luminosity in the high energy peak can be , in principle , several times higher than the luminosity .",
    "production of the polarized electron beams with emittances lower than those possible with damping rings is a challenging problem .",
    "there is one method , laser cooling  @xcite which allows , in principle , the required emittances to be reached .",
    "however this method requires laser power one order of magnitude higher than is needed for @xmath89 conversion .",
    "this is not excluded , but since many years of r&d would be required , it should be considered as a second stage of the photon collider , maybe for the higgs factory .",
    "a key element of photon colliders is a powerful laser system which is used for e@xmath90 conversion .",
    "lasers with the required flash energies ( several j ) and pulse duration @xmath91 1 ps already exist and are used in several laboratories .",
    "the main problem is the high repetition rate , about 1015 khz , with a pulse structure repeating the time structure of the electron bunches .",
    "a very promising way to overcome this problem at tesla is an `` external optical cavity '' approach which allows a considerable reduction of the required peak and average laser power  @xcite .",
    "technical aspects of this approach are considered by i.  will and his colleagues at this workshop  @xcite .",
    "another possible solution is a one - pass free electron laser .",
    "recently , first such laser has been successfully commissioned at desy  @xcite .",
    "this option is described by m.yurkov and colleagues  @xcite at this workshop .",
    "however , the most attractive and reliable solution at this moment is an `` optical storage ring '' with a diode pumped solid state laser injector which , it seems , can be build already now . this new approach can be considered as a base - line solution for the tesla photon collider .      the processes in the conversion region , i.e. compton scattering and several other important phenomena , have been considered in detail in papers  @xcite and references therein .",
    "laser parameters important for this task are : laser flash energy , duration of laser pulse , wave length and repetition rate .",
    "the requirement for the wave length was considered in the introduction .",
    "the optimum value for tesla(500 ) is @xmath80 1 .    in the calculation of the required flash energy one",
    "has to take into account the natural `` diffraction '' emittance of the laser beam  @xcite and nonlinear effects in the compton scattering .",
    "the nonlinear effects are characterized by the parameter @xmath92 @xcite ( @xmath6 is the energy of laser photons ) .",
    "due to nonlinear effects the high energy peak in the compton spectrum is shifted to lower energies : @xmath93 , this leads also to broadening of the high energy edge of the luminosity spectrum . therefore @xmath94 is required  @xcite .",
    "the result of mc simulation of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is the conversion coefficient ) for the electron bunch length @xmath97 mm ( tesla project ) , @xmath9 , @xmath82 as a function of the rayleigh length ( @xmath41-function of the laser beam at a focal point ) for various flash energies and values of the parameter @xmath74 ( in the center of the laser bunch ) are shown in fig.[k2 ] .",
    "it was assumed that the angle between the laser optical axis and the electron beam line is @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is the angular divergence of the laser beam in the conversion region ) , so that the mirror system is situated outside the electron beam trajectories .",
    "one conversion length corresponds to @xmath100 .",
    "one can see that @xmath64 at @xmath101 can be achieved with the minimum flash energy @xmath102 j. the optimum value of the rayleigh length is about 0.35 mm .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "duration of the laser pulse can be expressed via other laser parameters defined above  @xcite @xmath103}{z_r[{\\mbox{cm}}]\\xi^2}\\;\\mbox{cm},\\ ] ] where the last equality corresponds to @xmath9 . for @xmath104 and @xmath105 mm",
    "the optimum length of the laser bunch is @xmath106 mm or 1.5 ps .",
    "the angular size of the focusing mirror is taken to be equal to two r.m.s .",
    "angular spread ( in @xmath12 or @xmath107 directions ) at the conversion point  @xcite @xmath108 the ratio of the focal distance to the mirror diameter ( @xmath109 ) is equal to @xmath110 . for @xmath111",
    "m , @xmath112 cm .",
    "the fluence ( @xmath113@xmath114 ) in the center of the mirror is @xmath115 j/@xmath114 , while the damage threshold is in the range 0.72 j/@xmath114  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the final focusing mirror the optics inside the detector contains another mirror with about two times smaller diameter  @xcite ( see also fig.[loop ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fluence on this mirror is four times higher , about 0.3 j/@xmath114 . in the case of flattop laser beams approximately similar beam sizes in focus",
    "are obtained when the @xmath109 of the flattop beam is about 0.7 times that of the gaussian beam  @xcite .",
    "the fluence on the mirrors will be about 4 times smaller ( due to larger area and uniform distribution ) .    in summary",
    ": the required laser wavelength is about 1 , flash energy is 5 j , the repetition rate of about 14 khz , so the average power of the laser system should be about 70 kw each of two lasers .",
    "besides , at tesla the laser should work only 0.5 % of the time : one train of 1 msec duration contains 3000 bunches , the repetition rate is 5 hz . non - uniformity of lc operation ( the train structure ) is a very serious complication .",
    "below we will consider three variants of laser system : optical storage ring , external optical cavity , free - electron laser .",
    "present technique of short pulse powerful solid state lasers is based on the following modern technologies : pulsed - chirped techniques , diode pumping , adaptive optics .",
    "discussion of laser technologies for photon colliders can be found elsewhere  @xcite .      to overcome the `` repetition rate '' problem it is quite natural to consider a laser system where one laser bunch is used for e@xmath116 conversion many times .",
    "indeed , 5 j laser flash contains about @xmath117 laser photons and only @xmath118 photons are knocked out in one collision with the electron bunch . below two ways of multiple use of one laser pulse is considered . the first approach is shown in fig .  [ loop ] .    [ loop ]    in fig.[loop]a",
    "the laser pulse is used twice for @xmath89 conversion . after the collision with the electron beam ( number 1 ) the laser beam exits from the detector and after a 337 ns loop ( the interval between beam collisions at tesla ) returns back and collides with the opposite electron beam ( number 2 ) .",
    "the second pass does not need any special optical elements , only mirrors .",
    "this is a very natural and simple solution . in this scheme",
    "the laser system should generate bunches with an interval of 337 ns .    in fig.[loop]b",
    "the laser pulse is used for conversion four times . in this scheme",
    "one additional optical element is used , a thin film polarizer ( tfp ) , which is transparent for the light polarized in the plane of the paper and reflects the light with the orthogonal polarization .",
    "directions of the polarization during the first cycle are shown in fig.[loop]b .",
    "after the first cycle the polarization is perpendicular to the paper and the light is reflected from the tfp , while after the second cycle the polarization will be again in the plane of the paper and the laser pulse will escape the system via the tfp .",
    "the laser bunches are emitted by the laser at an average interval of 2@xmath119337 ns but not uniformly ( 337,3x337),(337,3x337 ) , etc ( see the next paragraph ) .    in fig.[loop]c",
    "the laser pulse is sent to the interaction region where it is trapped in an optical storage ring .",
    "this can be done using pockels cells ( p ) , thin film polarizers ( tfp ) and 1/4-wavelength plates ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "each bunch makes several ( n ) round trips and then is removed from the ring .",
    "all these tricks can be done by switching one pockels cell which can change the direction of linear polarization by 90 degrees .",
    "the @xmath120 plates are used for obtaining circular polarization at the collision point . for obtaining linear polarization at the ip these plates",
    "should be replaced by 1/2 wavelength plates .",
    "a similar kind of optical trap was considered as one of the options in the nlc zero - design report  @xcite .",
    "the number of cycles is determined by the attenuation of the pulse and by nonlinear effects in optical elements .",
    "the latter problem is very serious for tw laser pulses .",
    "during one total loop each bunch is used for conversion twice ( see fig.[loop]c ) .",
    "the laser bunch is collided first with electron beam 1 traveling to the right and after a time equal to the interval between collisions ( 333 ns ) it is collided with beam 2 traveling to the left . for arbitrary number of the round trips , @xmath121 , the laser pulse sequence is a sum of two uniform trains with the interval between neighboring pulses in each train @xmath122 and the trains are shifted on the time @xmath123    in fig.[loop]d the laser pulse is trapped in the same way as in fig.9c , but to avoid the problems of non - linear effect ( self - focusing ) in the optical elements , a laser pulse is compressed before the collision with the electron bunch down to about 23 ps using grating pairs , it is then stretched again up to the previous length of about 1 ns just before passing through the optical elements .",
    "which system is better , [ loop]c or [ loop]d , is not clear apriori . in the scheme ( c )",
    "the number of cycles is limited by nonlinear effects , in the scheme ( d ) additional attenuation is added by the gratings used for compression and stretching .",
    "optical companies suggest gratings for powerful lasers with @xmath124 % .",
    "one round trip needs four gratings , this means 20% loss / trip .",
    "so , the maximum number of trips is only about two .",
    "this present no advantages compared to the scheme [ loop]b which is simpler and also allows two cycles though it is not excluded that gratings with higher reflectivity will be available in future .",
    "how large can the decrease of the laser energy per round trip be in the scheme without bunch compressor - stretchers ?",
    "the minimum number of mirrors in the scheme is about 1520 .",
    "reflectivity of multilayer dielectric mirrors for large powers suggested by optical companies is about 99.8% or even better .",
    "so , the total loss / cycle is about 34% .",
    "let us add 1% attenuation in the pockels cell . due to the decrease of the laser flash energy the luminosity will vary from collision to collision .",
    "calculation shows that for 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 times attenuation of the laser pulse energy before the pulse is replaced , the  luminosity will only vary on 14 , 17 , 21 % ( here we assumed that on average the thickness of the laser target is one collision length ) . for 5% loss / turn and _ 6 round trips _",
    "the attenuation is 1.35 , which is still acceptable .",
    "let us consider the problem of nonlinear effects for the scheme [ loop]c .",
    "the refractive index of the material depends on the beam intensity @xmath125 this leads to self focusing of the laser beam  @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of self - focusing .",
    "the first type is a self - focusing of the beam as a whole .",
    "the second one is self - focusing and amplification of nonuniformities which leads to break up of the beam into a large number of filaments with the intensity exceeding the damage level .",
    "both these effects are characterized by the parameter b - integral  @xcite @xmath126    if the beam has a uniform cross section then nonlinear effects do not lead to a change of the beam profile , while for the gaussian like beam @xmath127 means that the self - focusing angle is approximately equal to the diffraction divergence of the beam .",
    "this is not a problem , such kind of distortions can be easily corrected using adaptive optics ( deformable mirrors ) .",
    "the second effect is more severe . even for uniform ( in average )",
    "distribution of the intensity over the aperture a small initial perturbation @xmath128 grows exponentially with a rate depending on the spatial wave number .",
    "the maximum rate is given by the same parameter @xmath129",
    "@xcite @xmath130 this is confirmed experimentally . to avoid small - scale growth",
    "the parameter @xmath129 should be smaller than 34  @xcite , in other words @xmath131    now we can get the relationship between the diameter and the maximum thickness of the material . for @xmath102 j , @xmath132 , @xmath133 = 1.5 ps and a typical value of @xmath134 @xmath114/w ( i have not found in literature @xmath135 for kd@xmath136p used for pockels cells ) and flat - top beam we get @xmath137 < 0.1 s [ { \\mbox{cm}}^2].\\ ] ] for a beam diameter of 15 cm",
    "we obtain @xmath138 cm . for gaussian beams",
    "the maximum thickness is about two times smaller .",
    "what is l ?",
    "is it the maximum thickness of one optical element , the thickness integrated over the loop or the previous one times the number of round trips ? in the scheme [ loop]c the dominant contribution to the total thickness is given by the pockels cell .",
    "after the pockels cell one can put a spatial filter and thus suppress the growth of spikes .",
    "so , @xmath139 in our case is the thickness of the pockels cell and it does not depend on the number of round trips .",
    "moreover , our laser pulse is very short , has a broad spectrum and the corresponding coherence length is small , about @xmath140 cm . the instabilities upon a uniform high intensity background developes due to interference of fluctuation with the main power .",
    "however , this coherence is lost after the coherence length . in my opinion ,",
    "the b - integral does not characterize the exponential growth of irregularities once the coherence length is much lower than @xmath139 .",
    "so , it seems , that the problem of nonlinear effects in the scheme [ loop]c is not dramatic .",
    "construction of a pockels cell with an aperture of about 1015 cm and switching time 300 ns is not a very difficult .",
    "quarter- and half - wave plates can be made thin or even joined with mirrors ( retarding mirror ) .    in conclusion , it seems , that the optical scheme [ loop]c with about 6 round trips ( 12 collisions with electron beams ) is a very attractive and realistic solution for the tesla photon collider .",
    "now a few words on a laser system required for a such an optical storage ring with 6 round trips .",
    "schematically it is shown in fig.[junction ] . at the start",
    "( this is not shown ) low - power laser produces a train of 1 msec duration consisting of 500 chirped pulses with duration several ns each .",
    "then these pulses are distributed between 8 final amplifiers ( see fig.[junction ] ) .",
    "each of the 8 sub - trains have a duration of 1 ms and consist of 62 pulses .",
    "after amplification up to the energy 5 j in one pulse these sub - trains are recombined to reproduce the initial time structure .",
    "the time spacing between bunches in the resulting train is equal in average to 6 intervals between beam collisions in tesla .",
    "[ junction ]    due to the high average power the lasers should be based on diode pumping .",
    "diodes have much higher efficiency than flash lamps , about @xmath141 % for single pulses . for pulse train ( as it is in our case ) it should be at least by factor of two higher . besides that , diodes are much more reliable . this technology is developed very actively for other application , such as inertial fusion .",
    "main problem with diodes is their cost .",
    "present cost of diode lasers is about 5 $ per watt  @xcite .",
    "let us estimate the required laser power . in the case of tesla ,",
    "the duration of the pulse train t@xmath142 = 1 msec is approximately equal to the storage time ( @xmath143 msec ) of the most promising powerful lasers crystal , such as yb : s - fap .",
    "therefore , the storage time does not help at tesla .",
    "the required power of the diode pumping is @xmath144 correspondingly , the cost of such diode system will be 25 m$. here we assumed 6-fold use of one laser bunch as described above .",
    "we see that even without pockels cell ( the scheme [ loop]b with two round trips ) the diode power is 15 mw and the cost of diodes is then 75 m$ , 12 percents of the lc cost .",
    "moreover , the livermore laboratory is now working on a project of inertial confinement fusion with a high repetition rate and efficiency with the goal to build a power plant based on fusion .",
    "this project is based on diode pumped lasers . according to ref.@xcite",
    "they are currently working on the `` integrated research experiment '' for which `` the cost of diodes should be reduced down to 0.5$/watt and the cost of diodes for fusion should be 0.07$/watt or less . ''",
    "thus , the perspectives of diode pumped lasers for photon colliders are very promising . with 1$/watt",
    "the cost of diode is 5 m$ for 6 round trips ( with pockels cell ) and 15 m$ for 2 round trips without pockels cell .",
    "average output power of all lasers in the scheme [ loop]c is about 12 kw , 1.5 kw for each laser .      one problem with the optical storage ring at photon colliders is the self - focusing in optical elements due to the very high laser pulse power .",
    "there is another way to `` create '' a powerful laser pulse in the optical `` trap '' without any material inside : laser pulse stacking in an `` external '' optical cavity  @xcite .    in short ,",
    "the method is the following . using the train of low energy laser pulses",
    "one can create in the external passive cavity ( with one mirror having some small transparency ) an optical pulse of the same duration but with the energy by a factor of q ( cavity quality factor ) higher .",
    "this pulse circulates many times in the cavity each time colliding with electron bunches passing the center of the cavity . for more details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a possible layout of the optics at the interaction region scheme is shown in fig.[optics ] . in this variant , there are two optical cavities ( one for each colliding electron beam ) placed outside the electron beams .",
    "[ optics ]    such a system has minimum numbers of mirrors inside the detector .",
    "one of several possible problems in such linear cavity ( pointed out by i.will at this workshop  @xcite ) is back - reflection , in a ring type cavity this problem would be much easier .",
    "a possible scheme of such a ring cavity for photon colliders is shown in fig.[ring ] ( only some elements are shown ) .",
    "[ ring ]    more detailed technical aspects of the external cavity approach were discussed by i.will and colleagues at this workshop  @xcite .",
    "such a cavity is operated already in their institute and a @xmath145 has been demonstrated . in their opinion ,",
    "the laser system with the optical cavity required for the photon collider can be made , though this task is much more difficult due to the much higher powers .    comparing the optical cavity approach with the `` optical trap''(or `` optical storage ring '' ) considered in previous subsection",
    ", i would say that the optical cavity is very attractive but less studied . here",
    "all tolerances should be of the order @xmath146 , while in the optical trap they are much more relaxed , about @xmath147 , difference 300 times for the same @xmath148 !      anther approach for a laser for the tesla photon collider is a free electron laser  @xcite .",
    "recently desy has demonstrated operation of a one pass fel with the wave length 0.1  and further goal is 1 nm ( this is included in tesla proposal ) . generation of 1  light is much a easier task .",
    "however this task is also not simple because to obtain the required flash energy a very large part of the electron beam energy should be converted to light .",
    "the peak and average power in the laser system at the photon collider is very large .",
    "the damage threshold for multilayer dielectric mirrors depends on the pulse duration .",
    "the empirical scaling law is  @xcite @xmath149 \\sim 10 \\sqrt{t[ns]}\\ ] ] for pulse durations ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds . at the llnl the damage threshold for 1.8 ps single pulses of 0.7 to 2 j/@xmath114",
    "have been observed on commercial multilayer surfaces  @xcite with an average flux on the level of 35 kw/@xmath114 .    comparing these numbers with the conditions at the tesla photon collider ( 5 j for 1.5 ps , 6000x5 j for 1 ms and 140 kw average power ) one finds that the average power requirements are most demanding . with uniform distribution",
    ", the surface of the mirrors should be larger than 140/5 = 28 @xmath114 and a factor of 23 larger for gaussian laser beams with cut tails .",
    "so , the diameter of the laser beam on mirrors and other surfacies should be larger than 10 cm .",
    "we have considered 3 possible options of laser system for tesla photon collider :    1 .   with about 8",
    "diode pumped driving lasers ( final amplifiers ) with total average power about 12 kw .",
    "beams are merged to one train using pockels cells and thin - film polarizers .",
    "each laser pulse makes 6 round trips in the optical trap colliding 12 times with the electron beams .",
    "this can be done now : all technologies exist .",
    "2 .   very attractive",
    "solution , but needs very high tolerances and mirror quality .",
    "serious r&d is required .",
    "3 .   is attractive due to variable wave length .",
    "high electron to photon energy conversion efficiency required is a problem .",
    "backgrounds at the tesla photon collider were discussed in the tesla conceptual design  @xcite .",
    "more simulations are necessary with detailed geometry and material . here",
    "we consider only two geometric questions connected with optics inside the detector .",
    "main background in the vertex detector are  pairs produced in ,  and  interactions .",
    "it is very similar to that in  collisions and may differ only in numbers .",
    "the shape of the zone occupied by the electrons kicked by the opposing beam is described by the formula  @xcite,@xcite @xmath150}}{\\sigma_z\\textrm{[mm]}b\\textrm{[t]}},\\;[\\mbox{cm}^2]\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the radius of the envelope at a distance @xmath152 from the ip , @xmath129 is longitudinal detector field .",
    "for example , for tesla ( @xmath153  mm , @xmath154  t ) @xmath155 } = 0.52\\sqrt{z\\textrm{[cm]}}$ ] .",
    "so , from the background consideration it follows than the vertex detector with a radius 2 cm can have the length about @xmath156 15 cm and a clear angle for the laser beams is @xmath156130 mrad .    as it was shown ( see eq.[thm ] ) the r.m.s .",
    "divergence of the the laser beam at the conversion point @xmath157 ; 2.5@xmath158 will be sufficient . as we consider the optics situated outside the electron beams ,",
    "the required clear angle is @xmath159 mrad .",
    "as we see the laser beams have enough space inside the vertex detector .",
    "together all the optics inside the detector covers the angle about 120140 mrad ( fig.[optics ] ) .",
    "however , it does not mean that this region is lost for the experiment .",
    "the thickness of mirrors will be of the order of 1 @xmath160 , and that will not affect too much the performance of the calorimeter placed behind the mirrors .",
    "due to the potential decrease of the horizontal beam emittance in the tesla damping ring the luminosity in  collisions ( in the high energy peak ) can reach about 1/3 of  luminosity . since cross sections in  collisions are typically higher by one order of magnitude than those in  collisions and because ,   collisions give access to higher masses of some particles , the photon collider now has very serious physics motivation .",
    "the key problem for photon colliders is the powerful laser system .",
    "there are several possible laser - optics schemes for photon collider at tesla .",
    "one of them has no visible problems and , it seems , can be build now .",
