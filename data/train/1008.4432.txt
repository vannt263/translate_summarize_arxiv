    "partonic internal structure of nucleon and nucleus have attracted many theoretical and experimental investigations in the past and are still in the frontier of the subatomic physics research .",
    "these studies aim at providing us accurate description of the hadronic structure in terms of fundamental degree of freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and meanwhile presenting an important path to discover the new physics beyond the standard model , which are currently undertaken at various high energy experiments , such as the fermilab tevatron , and the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "one of the most important objects is the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "these functions describe the internal structure of hadrons in terms of the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 carried by partons in the infinite momentum frame and the relevant qcd factorization has been well developed  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", hadronic physics community have extended the feynman parton distributions to include the dependence on additional dimensions , in particular in the transverse directions perpendicular to the parenting hadron momentum direction .",
    "these extensions appear in two different fashions : in the transverse coordinate space as the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite ; in the transverse momentum space as the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions ( tmds )  @xcite . a number of experimental facilities , such as the 12gev upgrade of jefferson lab , the relativistic heavy ion collider at the brookhaven national lab , and the planned electron - ion collider , are trying to measure these distribution functions .",
    "these studies will lead us to the final answers to the important questions concerning the nucleon ( nucleus ) structure : the proton spin and parton saturation in nucleon ( nucleus ) at small @xmath0 .",
    "transverse momentum dependence in the parton distributions is also crucial to understand some novel hadronic physics phenomena in high energy scattering processes .",
    "this includes , for example , the single transverse spin asymmetries   and small-@xmath0 saturation phenomena  . in the case for the small-@xmath0 physics , the so - called @xmath4-dependent parton distributions contain resummation effects which come from multiple scattering associated with the nucleus target .",
    "phenomenologically , the @xmath4-dependent gluon distribution ( also called unintegrated gluon distribution ) function has been applied to describe various high energy hadronic processes  iancu:2003xm .",
    "in general , the initial and final state interaction effects associated with the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions introduce additional qcd dynamics in these processes .",
    "for example , they lead to the non - universality for the transverse spin dependent tmd parton distributions  . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we extended the universality discussions of tmd parton distributions to the small-@xmath0 domain . in order to study the factorization issues relevant to small-@xmath0 saturation physics ,",
    "it is of advantage to focus on the two scale processes , such as semi - inclusive hadron production in deep inelastic scattering , drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic reactions , and the di - jet correlations in these processes . in particular",
    ", we analyzed the small-@xmath0 transverse momentum dependent quark distributions probed in hadronic dijet - correlation in nucleon - nucleus collisions , as compared to that in the deep elastic lepton - nucleus ( nucleon ) scattering .",
    "due to the nuclear enhancement , any soft gluon exchanges originated from the proton can be neglected .",
    "thus , we only need to resum the soft gluon exchanges with the nucleus target in the large nuclear number limit .",
    "this procedure eventually helps us to obtain an effective @xmath5 factorization with the modified nuclear parton distributions in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "there have been interesting experimental results on di - hadron correlation in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic , where a strong back - to - back de - correlation was found in the forward rapidity region of the deuteron as compared to the narrow back - to - back peaks observed in the central rapidity region  @xcite .",
    "the purposes of this paper are to derive in details the qed results which we described in ref .",
    "@xcite where we have shown the non - universality of tmd parton distributions , and then generalize to small-@xmath6 models in qcd",
    ".    we will start with a scalar - qed model calculation .",
    "there are a number of motivations for doing this .",
    "first , qed model is calculable , which makes it straightforward to resum all order initial and final state interaction effects in various processes .",
    "this allows us to rigorously discuss these effects , and shed light on the real qcd calculations .",
    "second , there is similarity between the qed model calculations and the qcd saturation models .",
    "quite a few results in the former framework can be directly generalized to the latter one .",
    "third , the qed calculations are important in their own perspective .",
    "high order corrections in qed processes are interesting topics and have attracted intensive investigations since the qed was founded several decades ago . in particular , for the lepton pair production and photon radiation processes associated with large nucleus , higher order qed corrections have generated interests from both theory and experiment sides  @xcite .",
    "current running heavy ion collisions experiments are pursuing these studies at both rhic and lhc facilities .",
    "the theoretical investigations shall provide further understanding of these processes .    in the saturation domain of qcd",
    ", the mclerran - venugopalan model  mclerran:1993ni describes high density small-@xmath0 partons in a relativistic large nucleus by treating the nucleus as a set of randomly distributed color sources @xmath7 which generate soft classical gluon fields . using the mclerran - venugopalan model",
    ", we will demonstrate that the @xmath5 dependent quark distributions at small-@xmath0 are not universal and the quark distributions involved in dis and di - jet production processes are distinct .",
    "furthermore , we find a simple formula to relate these two quark distributions through a convolution with the normalized unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we construct a scalar qed model to investigate the universality property for the small-@xmath0 parton distributions in various processes , where all gauge boson exchange contributions can be summed up , including all initial and final state interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate that the small-@xmath0 tmd quark distributions of a large nucleus are not universal as well . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we discuss the universality issue for the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions , by studying a scalar qed model",
    ". we will first introduce the qed model for our calculations , and discuss the universality issue of the tmd parton distribution functions in several processes .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to construct the model for our calculations .",
    "this is a qed scalar model .",
    "it consists of heavy @xmath8 and light @xmath9 charged scalars with masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , interacting with massive u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath12 with the mass @xmath13 , @xmath14 via the covariant derivative @xmath15 . in the above equation , we introduced two charged scalar particles , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with charges @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the purpose for this choice is to study the universality of the parton distribution in dijet - correlation .",
    "we will adopt this model to calculate the dis , drell - yan , and dijet processes .",
    "in particular , we will study the associated quark distribution functions in the small-@xmath0 limit and investigate the universality issue . in fig .  1",

    "1(a ) ) , virtual photon scatters on the scalar quark from the nucleus target .",
    "in our example , the nucleus target has strong coupling with the abelian gluon , @xmath20 .",
    "we need to resum all order gluon exchange contributions with the nucleus target , for which we have shown in the diagram .",
    "these interactions are referred as final state interactions .",
    "similarly , we have multi - gluon interaction contribution between the incoming scalar quark with the nucleus target in the drell - yan process as shown in fig .",
    "for the dijet - correlation process in fig .",
    "1(c ) , there are both initial and final state interaction contributions .",
    "the quark distribution functions in the dis and drell - yan processes in this scalar - qed model have been calculated in the literature .",
    "let us recapture the main step in these calculations . in the high energy scattering process , we apply the power counting method to separate short distance physics from that from long distance .",
    "this effectively factorizes the cross section in terms of parton distributions . in the multi - gluon exchange contributions illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", the dominant contribution in high energy limit comes from the parton distribution in nucleus target .",
    "for example , in the dis process , the leading power contribution to the differential cross section can be factorized into the quark distribution from nucleus in fig .",
    "of course , higher order corrections will be taken into account for the gluon radiation diagrams .",
    "the first step for this factorization is the eikonal approximation , which is valid in the leading power contribution , i.e. , @xmath21 for dis and drell - yan processes . under this limit",
    ", the final state interaction contribution diagram can be simplified as the eikonal propagator , which can also be summarized as the gauge link contribution from the associated parton distribution definition in these two processes .",
    "for the dijet - correlation , since there is no simple definition , we will not seek the gauge link definition for that , although there has been attempt to do that in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize in the leading power contribution , we shall be able to obtain the effective parton distributions in terms of the parton transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum fraction .",
    "we notice that higher order corrections will introduce large logarithms . to correctly resum these large logarithms , we need to pay special attention to the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions . at the current level of this paper , we do not need to worry about this additional effect .        in the scalar - qed model",
    ", the eikonal approximation leads to the final state interaction effect in fig .",

    "similarly , we will obtain the eikonal propagator for the final state interaction on the scalar antiquark as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and the initial state interaction on the scalar quark in fig .",
    ". the initial state interaction on the scalar antiquark will be opposite to that in fig .",
    "for the charge @xmath19 scalar quarks , we will have the same expressions by replacing @xmath18 with @xmath23 in these diagrams , respectively .",
    "in the following calculations , we will utilize these eikonal approximation for the relevant feynman diagrams .      in this subsection",
