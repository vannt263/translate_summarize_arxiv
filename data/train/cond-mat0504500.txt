    "the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect in doped manganites with perovskite structure has stimulated considerable interest for the understanding of their physical properties @xcite .",
    "though the insulator to metal ( i m ) transition and its associated cmr are well explained on the basis of the double exchange ( de ) model , it is pointed out that the dynamic jahn - teller ( jt ) effect due to the strong electron - phonon interaction , plays a significant role in the appearance of cmr as well as the de interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dagotto @xmath6 propose a phase separation model where ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating clusters coexist as supported by recent experimental studies on the physics of manganites @xcite .",
    "the bilayer manganite la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 exhibits a paramagnetic insulator ( pmi ) to ferromagnetic metal ( fmm ) transition around @xmath7120k and its associated cmr effect @xcite . in comparison with cubic manganites , the mr effect of the compound under consideration , due to its layered structure ,",

    "it is well known that pr - substitution on the la - site leading to ( la@xmath9pr@xmath10)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 causes an elongation of the @xmath11 axis length in contrast with a shrinkage of the @xmath12(@xmath13 ) axis , resulting in a change of the e@xmath14-electron occupation from the d@xmath15 to the d@xmath16 orbital @xcite .",
    "these findings also accompany a variation of the easy axis of magnetization from the @xmath17 plane to the @xmath11 axis . for the @xmath18=0.6 crystal",
    ", the field - induced fmm state is realized , instead of the pmi ground state in the absence of magnetic field . in fig.1 , a phase diagram in the @xmath19 plane established from the magnetization measurements carried out on the @xmath20 crystal , with three regions labeled as the pmi ,  fmm and mixed phases ( hatched area )",
    "is presented @xcite . a schematic diagram of free energy with two local minima corresponding to the pmi and fmm states is also given in fig.1 , for the virgin state ( a ) before application of the magnetic field , the field - induced state ( b ) after the pmi to fmm transition and the mixed state ( c ) after removal of the field .",
    "just after removing the field , the system still remains in a metastable fmm state . after a long time , the system comes back to the original pmi state through the mixed state consisting of both fmm and pmi regions . in the mixed state ,",
    "the total system is divided into a large number of subsystems which are randomly distributed with different local densities of free energy , causing complex relaxation processes observed in the physical property studies @xcite .",
    "a magnetic frustration between double - exchange ferromagnetic and superexchange antiferromagnetic interactions at the mn sites gives rise to a spin - glass - like behavior in manganites @xcite . in the mixed phase composed of metallic and insulating regions ,",
    "it is believed that the resistive relaxations reported @xcite arise from an electronic competition between double - exchange like itinerancy and carrier localization associated with the formation of polarons .",
    "recently , the slow dynamics of a remanent lattice striction of ( la@xmath0pr@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 single crystal has been examined on the basis of a competition between jahn - teller type orbital - lattice and de interactions@xcite .",
    "the former interaction induces a local lattice distortion of mn o@xmath21 octahedra along the @xmath11-axis but the latter suppresses a lattice deformation through the itinerant state @xcite .",

    "moreover , such a critical field is also controlled by changing an applied current ( fig.2 ( b ) ) a local joule heating assists a jump over potential barriers of local free energy allowing them to shift from pmi towards fmm states at numerous pmi clusters within the sample , resulting in a suppression in both the switching field and hysteresis effect . here , we estimate a volume fraction of metal ( or insulator ) from the @xmath27 data using an effective medium approximation ( ema ) @xcite . in our calculation",

    "the calculated curve based on the ema roughly reproduces the @xmath28 curve except for the low - field region in the demagnetization process .",
