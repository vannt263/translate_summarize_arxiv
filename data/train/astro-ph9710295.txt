    "first , we make a few comments the results we will _ not _ discuss in detail .",
    "the model of ly  @xmath1 clouds as progenitors of fbgs is supported by the size estimate for ly  @xmath1 clouds from q1343 + 2640 , which allows one to also calculate the comoving spatial number density and neutral hydrogen mass ( making assumptions about cloud shape ) , revealing several similarities between the populations : nearly identical ( comoving ) spatial number densities ( about 0.3  mpc@xmath18 , with @xmath19  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 ) , both very high in comparison to other extragalactic populations .",
    "they also have similar masses and clustering strengths .",
    "the size and mass of ly  @xmath1 clouds give an estimate of their collapse times ( also given their quiescent internal velocities ) , which at @xmath20 correspond to collapse at @xmath21 , consistent with constraints on the formation epoch of fbgs .",
    "we note @xcite that the ly  @xmath1 cloud size determination ( along with their line - of - sight number density ) allows the contribution of ly  @xmath1 clouds to the critical density , @xmath22 , to be estimated directly .",
    "it is larger or roughly equal to the baryon mass in ly limit or damped ly  @xmath1 , which altogether compose most of the baryons produced in the big bang .",
    "rauch & haehnelt @xcite find a similar result .",
    "these determinations depend on much simpler assumptions and are independent of estimates of @xmath23 obtained by comparing absorption structure along single sightlines to numerical models @xcite .",
    "we now consider several recent results [ 3,4 ] :",
    "the qso pair ( 1517 + 2357 at @xmath24 and 1517 + 2356 at @xmath25 , with 432  @xmath26  kpc transverse proper separation ) and the qso triplet kp 76/kp 77/kp 78 ( 1623 + 2651a at @xmath27 , 1623 + 2653 at @xmath28 , and 1623 + 2651b at @xmath29 , respectively , with proper transverse separations of @xmath30mpc ) were observed .",
    "data on all five qsos using the rc spectrograph on the kpno 4-meter were obtained at 1.4 - 1.7  fwhm resolution by us and elowitz et al .",
    "@xcite ( for 1517 + 2356/7 ) , and for 1517 + 2356/7 on @xmath0 using the fos g190h and g270h setups as part of program go 5320 of foltz et al .",
    "we use sightline cross - correlations of these data to estimate cloud size . for velocity differences @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 between lines in adjacent sightlines",
    ", one sees a large surplus for the qso triplet ( 21 seen versus 7.3 expected , random at the @xmath32 probability level ) on @xmath33mpc scales .",
    "this surplus persists over other published pairs [ 5,12 ] , and we refer to such a @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 coincidence as a `` hit . ''",
    "do the sizes of ly @xmath1 clouds change over cosmic time ? 1517 + 2356/7 is valuable in this connection , being intermediate in redshift between 0107 - 0234/5 , at @xmath34 , and other pairs at @xmath20 or higher .",
    "since it was observed with @xmath0 , its useful ly @xmath1 range extends to lower redshifts compared to the @xmath35 sample .",
    "figure 1 shows the inferred size of @xmath36  ly  @xmath1 clouds ( assuming that they are uniform - sized , unclustered spheres ) for 1517 + 2356/7 in relation to 0107 - 0234/5 and higher - redshift pairs .",
    "( shown are the median size calculated from the bayesian probability distribution , assuming uniform priors in cloud radius , and the confidence intervals corresponding to @xmath37 error bars . )",
    "these calculations are made according to our previous procedure @xcite , and include our new data on the 1623 + 269 triplet . as discovered previously",
    "@xcite , there is a significant trend of median estimated @xmath38 with @xmath39 , contrary to our assumed model .",
    "the slope in a linear fit of @xmath38 versus @xmath39 is @xmath40 for all qso pairs ( dashed line ) .",
    "if , noting that 0107 - 0234/5 appears to be discrepant , one leaves it out , one finds that the trend of @xmath38 with @xmath39 is almost unchanged and equally significant , with slope of @xmath41 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the other lower redshift qso pair , 1517 + 2356/7 , falls _",
    "below _ the trend set by higher redshift qsos . with",
    "the @xmath42 dependence removed , one finds the 0107 - 0234/5 point sitting @xmath43 above the minimum @xmath44 linear fit of @xmath38 versus @xmath45 , which shows no significant trend of size increase with @xmath45 ( best fit @xmath46 kpc per unit @xmath45 , with an error of 81  kpc per unit @xmath45 ) .",
    "there is so strong evidence for size evolution .",
    "it is also possible to use `` hit '' statistics to test directly the non - spherical models .",
    "numerical models of intergalactic objects in the early universe tend to find elongated structures on the scale of several hundred kpc as those with properties most similar to ly @xmath1 clouds .",
    "the triplet is ideal for determining whether the hit statistics deviate from an @xmath39-independent @xmath38 due primarily to elongated clouds ; single , long , thin filaments are incapable of intercepting all three sightlines .",
    "such an effect should be expressible as the probability of clouds of a given shape and size hitting two or all three sightlines whenever they hit one .",
    "this is accomplished by , first , measuring in the actual spectra s linelists the probabilities @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , ( defined as @xmath47 being the probability of a line in a resulting in a hit in b , or vice versa , and likewise for the other probabilities ) and , secondly , simulating the same probabilities by a numerical simulation of cylindrical rods of various aspect ratio @xmath51 and cross - sectional radius @xmath38 values .",
    "the probabilities are computed for each rod shape and size and agree better for small @xmath51 .",
    "the statistical significance of the difference between large and small @xmath51 is not great , decreasing from a maximum @xmath43 for large @xmath51 to 0.6 - 0.7@xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "nevertheless , all probabilities have best agreement for @xmath54 and @xmath55kpc@xmath56kpc ( larger @xmath38 at smaller @xmath51 ) , where @xmath57 .",
    "the high probability of three - way hits argues for sheets rather than filaments .",
    "we summarize another significant result : when we now consider how the difference in linestrength @xmath58 compares to the maximum linestrength @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) , we find that the most uniform lines ( smallest @xmath58 at given @xmath61 occur almost exclusively in the small fraction of lines _ which span all three sighlines in the qso triplet_. clouds which have an extent of at least @xmath62  mpc in two dimensions are also the most uniform in neutral hydrogen strength , suggesting sheets .",
    "clustering of c  iv lines in the qso triplet do not show the strong signal in cross - correlation between sightlines seen in auto - correlations along single sightlines .",
    "for instance , for lines with @xmath64@xmath65 , on scales corresponding to 200  km  s@xmath3  km  s@xmath4 , we measure a two - point cross - correlation of @xmath66 versus a corresponding single sightline auto - correlation value of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this is most easily understood in terms of internal structure within absorbers on velocity scales up to 600  km  s@xmath4 , a novel result ."
