    "the reynolds layer or warm ionized medium of the milky way is the repository of about 90% of the free electrons in the ism .",
    "how this medium is ionized , how its large ( @xmath6 1 kpc ; haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ) scale height is maintained , and how far it extends vertically are some of the main outstanding issues regarding this diffuse medium .",
    "new progress on these issues is being made with the wisconsin h@xmath4 mapper ( wham ; reynolds et al .",
    "a complementary approach is to examine this medium in external galaxies , where it is generally referred to as diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) .",
    "narrow - band imaging , spectroscopy , and fabry - perot observations have , in recent years , allowed the brightness , spatial distribution , emission line ratios , and kinematics of dig to be studied in many nearby galaxies ( e.g. golla , dettmar , & domg@xmath7rgen 1994 ; greenawalt , walterbos , & braun 1997 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ; wang , heckman , & lehnert 1997 ; rand 1997 ) .",
    "enhanced ratios of [ s@xmath0ii]@xmath8 6716,6731/h@xmath4 and [ n@xmath0ii]@xmath8 6548,6583/h@xmath4 in the reynolds layer and external dig layers relative to hii regions ( e.g. haffner et al .",
    "1999 ; golla et al . 1994",
    "; ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ; rand 1997 ) can be explained if the dominant source of ionization is dilute radiation leaked out of star forming regions from massive stars .",
    "however , recent high - quality data indicate departures from this simple picture : first , the near constancy with @xmath5 of [ s@xmath0ii]/[n@xmath0ii ] in both the milky way and external edge - on galaxies ( haffner et al . 1999 ; golla et al . 1994 ; rand 1998 ) , whereas a rise is expected ( e.g. domg@xmath7rgen & mathis 1994 ; sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) ; second , [ s@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 and [ n@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 reach values @xmath9 which are difficult for models to reproduce ; and third , [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath4 in the edge - on spiral ngc 891 is found to _ rise _ with @xmath5 ( rand 1998 ) , whereas it is expected to fall as oxygen becomes predominantly singly ionized .    two explanations for this behavior have been put forth . while viable , both are limited by our knowledge of the energizing sources of halos in general .",
    "first , reynolds , haffner , & tufte ( 1999 ) and haffner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have pointed out for the reynolds layer that the behavior of [ s@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 , [ n@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 and [ s@xmath0ii]/[n@xmath0ii ] could be explained if gas temperature rather than dilution of the ionizing radiation field ( and accompanying changes in the ionization state of the metals ) were the key parameter that changed with @xmath5 , since the first two ratios are very temperature sensitive while the third is not .",
    "this idea has yet to be applied to an external galaxy .",
    "the alternative explanation , which has generally been considered for external galaxies ( e.g. rand 1998 ; galarza , walterbos , & braun 1999 ; martin 1997 ) , is a secondary source of ionization , such as shocks ( e.g. shull & mckee 1979 ) or turbulent mixing layers ( slavin , shull , & begelman 1993 ) which contribute a fraction of the h@xmath4 emission which is small but increases with @xmath5 .",
    "the attractive feature of such ionizing sources is that they can yield a high [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath4 ratio without necessarily dominating the emission from the other observable lines .",
    "a second issue well addressed in external galaxies is the vertical variation of the dig kinematics .",
    "it has been found in the dig of ngc 891 that the observed velocities along one vertical slit through the disk become closer to the galaxy systemic velocity with increasing @xmath5 , suggesting a fall in the rotation speed ( rand 1997 ) .",
    "hi data suggest that the effect is widespread in the lower halo ( swaters , sancisi , & van der hulst 1997 ) .",
    "the rate of falloff will depend on the galactic potential and the hydrodynamic nature of the disk - halo gas cycle ( benjamin 2000 ) .    finally , of great interest",
    "is the detectable extent of dig layers .",
    "dig in ngc 891 and ngc 5775 has been detected to about @xmath10 kpc ( rand 1997 ; hoopes et al . 1999 ) , and @xmath11 kpc ( collins et al . 2000 ) , respectively , while deep , wide - field imaging of ngc 4631 indicates emission up to 16 kpc from the plane ( donahue , aldering , & stocke 1995 ) .",
    "this paper presents spectra of the edge - on galaxy ngc 5775 , which has been previously imaged in the h@xmath4 line by collins et al .",
    "it is an interacting galaxy ( e.g. irwin 1994 ) with a high far infrared luminosity and inferred far infrared surface brightness ( collins et al .",
    "2000 ) indicating active star formation .",
    "its dig layer is very bright and extended , as mentioned above , and features some of the most prominent vertical filamentary structure found above a galactic disk .",
    "here we focus on several dramatic new results from these spectra .",
    "a full analysis of these data and spectra of three other edge - ons in terms of the the two ionization / heating scenarios discussed above will be presented in a future paper ( paper ii ) by collins & rand ( in preparation ) .",
    "another paper ( paper iii ) will examine the kinematics of the ngc 5775 halo .",
    "the spectra were obtained at the kpno 4-m telescope on 1999 june 1013 .",
    "the slit positions run perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , as shown in figure 1 , where they are overlaid on the h@xmath4 image from collins et al .",
    "the central positions of the slits are given in table 1 .",
    "the slit length is 5 , the slit width is 2  for the galaxy observations , and the spatial scale is 0.69 \" per pixel .",
    "slit 1 was chosen to include emission from the most prominent extraplanar dig filament , while slit 2 covers a region of weaker emission .",
    "the kpc-007 grating was used with the t2 kb 2048x2048 ccd , providing a dispersion of 1.42 @xmath12 per pixel , a resolution of 3.5 @xmath12 , and a useful coverage of @xmath13 .",
    "many half - hour spectra were taken .",
    "total integration times are given in table 1 .",
    "the basic reduction steps are as described in rand ( 1998 ) , and here we only describe processing of the final , stacked , calibrated spectra .",
    "emission from some of the stronger lines extends nearly to the edge of the slit , complicating sky subtraction .",
    "in addition , there is a focus variation of unknown origin , causing the lines towards the ends of the slit to be significantly broader than those closer to the center , precluding accurate subtraction of the night sky lines .",
    "while the general sky background can still be corrected for , sky lines , when blended with galaxy emission lines , are deconvolved in the line fitting process .",
    "this blending was mainly a problem for the h@xmath4 line , which coincided with a blended pair of sky lines . towards the ends of the slit ,",
    "the combined intensity from these sky lines became very constant , indicating that there was no measurable h@xmath4 and that this intensity value could be used in determining the true h@xmath4 intensity elsewhere along the slit .",
    "a much fainter sky line near [ o@xmath0iii ] was corrected for in the same way .",
    "strong sky lines also precluded measurements or meaningful upper limits on the [ o@xmath0i ] @xmath14 and he@xmath0i@xmath15 lines for slit 1 , and the [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath16 line for both slits .",
    "line parameters reported here are determined from spectra averaged along the spatial direction , typically by 10 pixels , or 830 pc at an assumed distance of 24.8 mpc ( irwin 1994 ) .",
    "line properties were determined with gaussian fits , using a linear fit to the continuum on each side of the line . for uncertainties on intensities and central wavelengths ,",
    "the variance of these quantities along each slit for sky lines of a range of intensities were determined , and an estimate of the dependence of these variances on sky line intensity was formed .",
    "this relation was then used to determine uncertainties for the emission lines of interest .",
    "the detection limit for intensities is about 10@xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 .",
    "one of the most important results is the tremendous height above the plane to which emission can be detected , providing unique information on the ionization state and kinematics of gas at large distances above the midplane .",
    "[ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath21 is detected to about @xmath22 kpc and @xmath23 kpc on both sides of slits 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "h@xmath4 is detected up to about @xmath24 kpc in slit 1 and @xmath25 kpc in slit 2 .",
    "[ o@xmath0iii ] @xmath26 is detected to about @xmath27 kpc on the ne side of slit 1 .",
    "the halo of ngc 5775 therefore has the greatest spectroscopically detected extent in emission of any spiral galaxy halo .",
    "the vertical emission profiles will be examined in paper ii ; we merely point out for the current purposes that , for data averaged over 10 spatial pixels , the h@xmath4 intensity reaches peak values , in slits 1 and 2 , respectively , of 1.8 and 6.5 @xmath28 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 , falling by @xmath10 kpc to 7.5 and 3.8 @xmath29 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 ( ne and sw values have been averaged together ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the vertical runs of the line ratios [ s@xmath0ii ] @xmath30/h@xmath4 , [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath21/h@xmath4 , [ s@xmath0ii]/[n@xmath0ii ] and [ o@xmath0iii ] @xmath26/h@xmath4 . because of the 85@xmath31 ( irwin 1994 ) inclination of the galaxy , for points within 10  of the midplane ( @xmath32 1200 pc in the figures ) , the spatial axis reflects in - plane , highly - inclined disk structure rather than true height above the plane , and line ratio variations are more due to the line of sight crossing hii regions and areas between them",
    "this fact explains why line ratio minima are not always at @xmath33 kpc .",
    "for the first two ratios , one sees , for the most part , similar behavior to many dig halos previously observed , although these measurements extend to much larger heights : a general rise with @xmath5 , with disk values of 0.20.3 and halo values of [ n@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 reaching @xmath341 in places .",
    "in general , these ratios rise more slowly with @xmath5 than in ngc 891 .",
    "the relatively low and constant values on the ne side of slit 1 arise from the bright filament , and may simply reflect the well established correlation between these ratios and h@xmath4 surface brightness ( wang , heckman , & lehnert 1998 ; rand 1998 ) . in common with the east side of the halo in the spectra of ngc 891 ( rand 1997 , 1998 ) , [ n@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 on the ne side of slit 1 reaches a maximum at @xmath11 and",
    "subsequently falls , although the maximum is reached at only @xmath35 kpc in ngc 891 .",
    "there is a suggestion of similar behavior in both lines on the sw side of slit 1 .",
    "[ s@xmath0ii]/[n@xmath0ii ] is reasonably constant in the halo at a value of about 0.7 in both slits , but shows more variation than in ngc 891 , reaching extremes of 0.4 and 1.1 .",
    "we examine [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath4 rather than [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath36 since the former can be determined to larger @xmath5 . with the exception of the ne side of slit 2 , where it remains relatively constant up to @xmath37 kpc , this ratio shows a clear increase with @xmath5 , from values of 0.050.4 in the disk to as high as 1.2 in the halo . unlike the afore - mentioned line ratios , slit 1",
    "does not show a significant local maximum in this ratio , although the final data point on the sw side suggests that a maximum may have been reached .",
    "the behavior is qualitatively similar to ngc 891 ( rand 1998 ) , except that those measurements extended to only @xmath35 kpc , where a value of [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath38 was reached .",
    "assuming optically thin gas at 10,000 k , the peak [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath4 of 1.2 corresponds to [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath39 .",
    "[ o@xmath0i]/h@xmath4 rises from around 0.02 in the disk to 0.06 at @xmath35 kpc on the sw side of slit 2 .",
    "he@xmath0i @xmath40 has been detected in slit 2 , but only for four ten - pixel averages in the disk can meaningful values be measured .",
    "the mean of the four he@xmath0i / h@xmath4 ratios is @xmath41 ( the uncertainty is the dispersion of the four values ) .",
    "there is no significant correlation of the ratio with h@xmath4 intensity .",
    "these data allow halo kinematics to be probed to unprecedented heights .",
    "figure 3 shows velocity centroids of the [ n@xmath0ii ] @xmath42 and [ s@xmath0ii ] @xmath43 lines as a function of slit position for data averaged over ten pixels .",
    "the heliocentric systemic velocity , as determined from hi data , is @xmath44 km s@xmath19 ( irwin 1994 ) .",
    "once again , points at @xmath32 1.2 kpc represent disk emission .",
    "the midplane values in both slits indicate rotation speeds roughly consistent with the rotation curve found by irwin ( 1994 ) .",
    "the falloff towards @xmath45 for @xmath32 1.2 kpc is expected for a differentially rotating disk viewed at a not quite edge - on aspect .    beyond this point , though , the velocities are of the halo gas .",
    "they continue to move closer to @xmath45 with increasing @xmath5 , coming to within 20 km s@xmath19 of @xmath45 except on the sw side of slit 1 .",
    "the simplest explanation of this behavior is that the rotation speed falls with @xmath5 , as suggested for ngc 891 ( rand 1997 ) , but here becoming roughly consistent with _ no _ rotation at the largest heights .",
    "the exact translation from observed to rotational velocities is complicated by the unknown distribution of gas along the line - of - sight .",
    "this issue will be explored in paper iii . given the symmetry on either side of the two slits ,",
    "it is unlikely that the kinematics are dominated by the tidal interaction ngc 5775 is undergoing .",
    "for slit 1 , the steeper falloff on the ne side may reflect a receding motion of the prominent filament . in paper iii",
    ", we will attempt to constrain the dependence of @xmath46 with @xmath5 and examine whether the falloff is expected for a reasonable mass model , or whether other hydrodynamical effects ( benjamin 2000 ) may be important .",
    "without carrying out detailed modeling , we can already make conclusions about the possible source(s ) of ionization and physical conditions in the dig that may explain the emission line ratios and their vertical runs . as in ngc 891 and the reynolds layer",
    ", one can already conclude that pure photoionization models will not be able to explain the runs of all the line ratios .",
    "most problematic are the increasing values of [ o@xmath0iii]/h@xmath4 with @xmath5 , in complete contrast to photoionization models . also of concern",
    "is the relative lack of variation in [ s@xmath0ii]/[n@xmath0ii ] .",
    "hence , we are led to consider the two possible deviations from the pure photoionization picture discussed in  1 . both may be able to reproduce the trends in these two line ratios , as well as [ s@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 , [ n@xmath0ii]/h@xmath4 , and [ o@xmath0i]/h@xmath4 . in paper ii , we will use data on four edge - ons ( ngc 891 , ngc 5775 , ugc 10288 , and ngc 4302 ) to ascertain whether one or the other of these models provides a more adequate description of the data .",
    "other complications include abundances and the extent to which depletions ( e.g. howk & savage 1999a ) are important , as well as scattering of disk light into the line of sight by extraplanar dust . absorption due to dust has been shown to be prevalent in several dig halos ( howk & savage 1999b ) .",
    "modeling of ngc 891 ( ferrara et al .",
    "1996 ) suggests that scattered light is a minor contributor to diffuse halo h@xmath4 emission ( 10% at @xmath47 pc ) and declines with @xmath5",
    ". nevertheless , scattered light may be significant in some cases .",
    "apart from the excitation , the kinematics of gaseous halos and the extent to which gas can be expelled from the disk are relevant issues not only to the nature of the disk - halo cycle , but in the interpretation of qso absorption line systems .",
    "for instance , mg@xmath0ii absorption is probably due to both halos and disks ( charlton & churchill 1998 ) ; consequently possible low-@xmath5 analogs of absorbers need to be well characterized at faint levels ."
