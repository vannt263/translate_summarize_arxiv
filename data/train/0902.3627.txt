    "it is a testament to the ingenuity of nature that at all length scales there exists a multitude of complex self - assembled patterns .",
    "the formation of patterns , from the textured dimples in a grain of pollen to the labyrinth of creases in a coral colony to the ridges in a fingerprint , is consistent and repeatable @xcite ; the mechanisms that drive them are far from understood .",
    "mastery of such processes would revolutionize the fabrication and design of novel materials with specific properties . by harnessing elastic instabilities in elastomeric membranes",
    "@xcite , the once lofty goal of creating self - assembled complex patterns with long range order is now a one step closer .    when an elastomeric membrane with a square lattice of circular holes ( with diameter roughly half the lattice spacing ) in it is uniformly swollen or , alternatively , is compressed hydrostatically , the holes deform into a diamond plate pattern .",
    "the order persists for upwards of @xmath0 times the original lattice spacing with only phase - slip defects , which do not change the overall symmetry of the pattern .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same diamond plate pattern emerges from membranes with vastly different lattice spacings , ranging from @xmath1 m to 1 cm . because the same mechanism causes patterns to form over such a wide range of length scales , this technique is well suited to create devices for many fields and industries . in particular ,",
    "when a material is in the diamond plate state , it has a photonic band - gap @xcite ; hence , merely by compressing and relaxing a membrane , we can control its band structure .",
    "this effect occurs in the highly non - linear regime of elasticity ; thus , only finite element simulations using specific models of nonlinear elasticity capture the entire process of the holes collapsing @xcite .",
    "however , some simulations merely predict the orientational order of the collapsed holes and can not capture the details of their final shape . with the sole assumption that each hole collapses to some elongated shape ,",
    "our model uses only linear elasticity to successfully predict the orientational order in the diamond plate pattern and the herringbone pattern formed from an underlying triangular lattice .",
    "not only does our model shed light on the interactions in the system , it greatly facilitates the rational design of other patterns and devices .    in the next section",
    ", we review the linear theory of elasticity and consider a hydrostatically compressed membrane containing either a single hole or two holes .",
    "the breakdown of linear elasticity illustrates the need for non - linear analysis . in section iii ,",
    "we adopt the spirit of the theory of cracks and show that complex behavior can be explained by recasting the problem using linear dislocation theory .",
    "while an explicit analytic description of the shape of a collapsed hole can not be reached through this method , each hole can be modeled as an elastically interacting distribution of parallel edge dislocations , or `` dislocation dipoles , '' whose centers are fixed to the center of their corresponding hole but are allowed to rotate freely . in the simple case of a quartet of holes , the resulting configuration exactly reproduces the unit cell for the diamond plate pattern . since elastic interactions are long ranged , the collective interactions of all the holes must be included to find the true groundstate of the system the inclusion of which additionally stabilize the pattern .",
    "we end with technical appendices which argue the validity of our approximation .",
    "the theory of linear elasticity describes the deformation and energetics of a solid body under external force or load .",
    "while this theory was originally developed over a century ago and has been presented time and again @xcite , this brief tutorial will illuminate a few salient features as well as familiarize the reader to our notation .",

    ", there is an energy cost associated with displacing every point from its equilibrium position .",
    "while the general form is quite complicated , to first order the energy can be constructed from the linear strain tensor . because the strain tensor is a symmetric rank two tensor , the only two possible scalar invariants that can be constructed are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . because these terms are invariants of the system",
