    "since defects exist in any real system , the understanding of their influence on ordering and structural phase transitions is important .",
    "a signature of the presence of defects in a crystal near a phase transition is the so - called `` two length - scale '' behavior , in which , in the critical diffuse scattering ( cds ) of x - rays or neutrons , a narrow `` central peak '' is found on top of a broad peak  @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies of this behavior have established that one cause of this is the presence of dislocation lines  @xcite .",
    "these theories argue that the strain field associated with a dislocation line results in the growth of a roughly cylindrical ordered region near the dislocation line itself .",
    "such regions order at a temperature higher than the defect - free crystal . accordingly , while the order occurs in the cylindrical regions , the broad peak in the cds is due to thermal fluctuations in regions of the material which are relatively unaffected by the strain field , while the narrow central peak is due to the fluctuations in regions where the enhanced ordering occurs .",
    "unaccounted for in these theories , however , is the fact that in many real systems defects do not exist uniformly throughout the crystal",
    ". often defects are caused by surface treatments or surface reconstructions and in this case they accumulate near the surface and their density decays with depth . when this happens , the ordering properties and two length - scale behavior depend on depth as well .",
    "indeed , with high resolution x - ray diffraction measurements , we have previously found that v@xmath0h  has two length - scale and associated behavior that is depth dependent  @xcite .",
    "these measurements were performed in both reflection and transmission geometries , allowing us to compare the behavior of the crystal at different depths . in this paper , we propose a theoretical explanation of these experimental results that accounts for the depth dependence of the observed behavior .",
    "systematic studies of many materials in which two length - scale behavior has been found  @xcite , including previous studies of v@xmath0h  @xcite , have concluded that the narrow central peak of the cds only occurs in the scattering from a defective `` skin layer '' , that is a region of the material that starts a few hundred  below the surface and extends several tens of @xmath1 m below the surface .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the two - length - scale behavior in v@xmath0h  is different from that which has been observed in any other material , because in v@xmath0h  the phase transition in the bulk is a first - order transition . in the skin layer , instead , the ordering is more complicated as found experimentally by a number of unusual phenomena including : ( 1 ) diffuse scattering which , as the temperature is lowered toward a critical value , consists of a broad peak that changes only slightly with temperature and a narrow central peak with an amplitude that diverges  @xcite ; ( 2 ) an effective critical temperature @xmath2 for the behavior of the central peak that changes with the depth @xmath3 below the surface and extrapolates to a temperature @xmath4 that always exceeds the bulk transition temperature  @xmath5  @xcite ; ( 3 ) a crossover in the universal critical behavior shown by the central peak from three - dimensional mean field critical behavior to a different universality class as the temperature increases from @xmath2  @xcite ; ( 4 ) a narrow two - phase region and a weak first - order transition observed at temperatures @xmath6 slightly below the critical value  @xcite .",

    "however , in contrast to previous theories , which assumed the ors grow freely , in our theory the interaction between lines constrains their collective growth .",
    "the ordering process responsible for the formation of the ors is continuous and this explains the change in the order of the phase transition from first - order in the bulk to continuous in the skin layer .",
    "then , as the ors grow and occupy more than a certain fraction of the material , the crossover in the universal critical behavior of the central peak occurs .",
    "since the density of dislocation lines decreases with depth , the effective critical temperature also varies with depth .",

    ", in transmission geometry there is clear evidence of a first - order transition in the bulk material ( see fig .",
    "[ firstorder ] ) . the diffuse scattering from the skin layer can be measured at various depths in reflection geometry by varying beam energy and reflection order . at temperatures above the bulk transition temperature ,",
    "what we find is a broad peak corresponding to the bulk diffuse scattering , which increases slowly with decreasing temperature , coexisting with a central peak whose amplitude diverges at a temperature still higher than the bulk transition one  @xcite .",
    "the cds of the central peak indicates that the transition is continuous in a skin layer that has a depth of several tens of  @xmath1 m .",
    "remarkably , the temperature at which the cds diverges depends on the depth probed .",
    "thus , we find a depth dependent critical temperature @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the effective scattering depth  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .  , there is a two - length scale effect in the cds from the skin layer .",
    "as the temperature is lowered toward @xmath2 , the height of the central peak , which is proportional to the susceptibility , shows a crossover in critical scaling behavior .",
    "in fact , for temperatures close to the critical temperature , the value of the critical exponent @xmath12 in the law @xmath45 , describing the divergence of the susceptibility with the reduced temperature @xmath46 , is always consistent with 1 ; similarly , the full width at half maximum of the central peak , which is proportional to the inverse correlation length @xmath17 , and which scales as @xmath47 , has its exponent always compatible with 0.5 ( see two examples in fig .  [ crosso ] ) .",
    "also , we notice that , regardless of the depth , the value of @xmath12 is always compatible with @xmath48 .",
    "note that these values of @xmath12 and @xmath18 , measured for small @xmath14 , correspond to three - dimensional mean field values .",
    "we have considered the integrated intensities @xmath22 of the superstructure reflections , which are proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "we find that the intensities exhibit power - law variations for temperatures below the critical value , but only if one neglects a narrow temperature range of @xmath24  k close to the critical point , which corresponds to a two - phase coexistence region ( see figs .  [ 2phase ] and  [ beta ] ) .",
    "the existence of this region indicates that , even in the skin - layer , there is an actual first - order transition , albeit with a weak character , as indicated by the power law behavior outside the aforementioned small range of temperatures .",
    "the measured value of @xmath49 , however , is not mean field but it is in agreement with an earlier measurement on a different crystal  @xcite .    above the crossover , at larger @xmath14 ,",
    "different universal critical behavior is observed .",
    "measurements indicating values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 have previously been reported  @xcite .",
    "however , other data fits at these larger values of @xmath14 give a range of values for @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ crosso ] values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are found .",
    "thus , unfortunately , the existing experimental data sets do nt allow us to determine accurately the critical exponents for temperatures higher than the crossover .",
    "the available data show values for @xmath12 as low as about 1.8 and as high as 3 and values of @xmath18 from about @xmath54 to 2 .    regarding the presence of defects in the material , dislocation walls are the only kind of defect that extends into the crystal for several @xmath1 m .",
    "other kinds of defects are not found after the first 150   , and the influence of this upper region on the scattering is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of dislocation lines into walls , in the skin layer , is indicated by the mosaic spread .",
    "walls occur inhomogeneously across the surface , so that in planes parallel to the surface there is an inhomogeneous distribution of dislocation lines  @xcite .",
    "in order to give a picture that describes the unusual experimental behavior of v@xmath0h  detailed above , let us consider a ginzburg - landau free energy density expansion for a crystal with an anisotropic distribution of dislocation lines .",
    "this free energy density is of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the order parameter field , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are coefficients that depend on position @xmath60 , thermodynamic parameters , and , in some cases , the strain fields created by dislocations and structural ordering . in particular , the order parameter field is defined to be 0 for regions of the material which are in the disordered phase , 1 for points in the ordered phase with the hydrogen atoms in the @xmath43 sites , and @xmath61 for the ordered phase with the hydrogen atoms in the @xmath44 sites .",
    "also note that in the above equation the odd powers are missing as their presence is disallowed by the symmetry of the crystal structures .",
    "much of the unusual phenomenological behavior observed in v@xmath0h  can be explained through the behavior of the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which depends on the strain fields caused by the edge dislocations and on the structural ordering that occurs preferentially near them . in order to provide such explanation",
    ", we must not only understand the mechanism by which strain fields modify @xmath57 and @xmath58 in general , but also what specific modifications result from the particular morphological arrangement of dislocation lines that occurs in v@xmath0h .",
    "we will see that while the behavior of @xmath57 can explain the spatial variation of the critical temperature , the corrections to the fourth - order term justify instead the change in order of the transition .",
    "in particular , while a ginzburg - landau expansion yields critical behavior for vanishing odd - order terms , we can still describe a first - order transition by letting @xmath58 go negative .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will first discuss the effects of the defects on @xmath57 , explaining the behavior of the critical temperature .",
    "then , we will describe the shape of the ordered regions near the dislocation lines .",
    "next , we will show how the ordering strains affect @xmath58 , how this makes the transition in the skin - layer continuous , and how the crossover occurs .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss the effects of the depth - dependent crossover temperature on the size of the critical region and give an argument for the presence of a weak first - order transition in the skin - layer .",
    "the compression - dilatation effect of an edge dislocation on a crystal is responsible for a change in critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "we can assume that the atoms of the crystal interact more strongly where they are pushed closer to each other , and vice versa that they interact more weakly in the opposite direction .",
    "as a first approximation we can assume that the correction to the critical temperature is proportional to the elastic strain in the crystal .",
    "the elastic strain can be found following the general procedure described in ref .  .",
    "in the case of a single dislocation line this yields a trace of the stress tensor @xmath62 that in polar coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath63 centered on the dislocation line is @xmath64 where @xmath1 is the shear modulus , @xmath18 is poisson s ratio and @xmath65 is the magnitude of the burgers vector . making use of the relations between elastic constants  @xcite , we can rewrite eq .",

    "in the case of multiple dislocations , the effects of the single dislocation lines get superimposed . for walls of dislocations ,",

    "the sum of the series above is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the unit of length used .",
    "it should be noticed that the contribution decays exponentially with the normal distance @xmath82 from the wall , in agreement with the experimental results in ref .  .",

    "then , consider the particular case of a local expansion due to the difference of structure between 2 points .",
    "given our order parameter field @xmath133 , this expansion , purely hydrostatical since it s applied to an infinitesimal volume , can be thought of as due to an equivalent pressure @xmath134 = k\\frac{\\delta v}{v}\\eta\\left ( \\vec{r}\\right)\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the bulk modulus . since we are associating a change of volume with a point , what we want to consider is the smallest volume for which it makes sense to think about a change of structure , that is , the volume of a unit cell .",
    "so , calling @xmath135 the volume of a unit cell in the ordered phase and @xmath136 the one in the disordered phase , we have @xmath137 , hence @xmath138 the work done to achieve this deformation is @xmath139 and we can use this expression in eq .",

    "for any particular @xmath140 , @xmath143 vanishes in the limit of @xmath144 . then , knowing the field in every point , the total displacement at @xmath140 is @xmath145 ^2}{v_d\\left ( \\vec{r'}\\right ) } \\frac{\\vec{r'}}{{r'}^3}\\ : , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the integral is extended over all the points in the disordered phase .    strictly speaking , eq .",

    ", @xmath146 has the opposite sign and the term in parentheses in eq .",
    "[ pressure ] is @xmath147 . yet , since @xmath148 , the error committed in using the same formula is very small ; in fact , in the subsequent equations the volume difference ends up squared , so that the error is actually of second order and is neglected in this linear treatment .",
    "notice also that , after integration , the displacement is not necessarily purely hydrostatic .    from the displacement vector we can find the components of the strain tensor in cartesian coordinates as @xmath149 then , from the generalized hooke s law , we can find the correction to the free energy density due to the deformation induced by the phase transition , @xmath150 , as @xmath151 it s to be stressed that this quadratic form is always positive , since @xmath67 and @xmath1 are always positive .",
    "in fact , since the body is in equilibrium , in the absence of forces the energy must have a minimum at @xmath152 , that is , the quadratic form must be positive .",
    "since this has to happen in any case , it also has to happen when the stress is a pure shear or a pure hydrostatic compression , that is when only one of the two addenda is non - zero .",
    "this is the reason why both @xmath67 and @xmath1 must always be positive  @xcite .",
    "moreover the squares make this correction actually proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "then , when it is applied to the @xmath154  order coefficient in the free energy density expansion , where it belongs since its functional form is that of a strain , it yields a positive effective correction to the @xmath155  order term .",
    "this correction , which corresponds exactly to the elastic free energy , does not depend on the actual structure of defects that causes it , but merely on the order parameter field and , of course , on the elastic constants of the material .",
    "this means that , regardless if it s coming from a single dislocation , a wall of dislocations , or a more complicated framework of defects , once the elements of the strain tensor are known , they can be used to correct directly the free energy density expansion as discussed and as follows : @xmath156 \\rbrace \\eta^2\\\\ & \\quad+\\left [ a_4+\\frac{b}{\\eta^2}\\right ] \\eta^4+a_6\\eta^6\\ : , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the local relative critical temperature change resulting from the superposition of the contributions of single dislocation lines ( eq .  [ newredloctc ] ) and dislocation walls ( eq .  [ critempwall ] ) .",
    "while no quantitative solution of the above equations is offered here , notice that an explicit calculation would be very difficult .",
    "in fact , even in simpler cases of lattices in only 2 dimensions featuring regularly arranged point defects with short range interactions , the results can be highly non - trivial  @xcite .    we know , however , that , from a purely phenomenological point of view , the change of order in a phase transition can be associated with the change of the sign of @xmath58 , which determines whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous .",
    "the fact that the correction to this coefficient is always positive , shows how an originally negative @xmath58 can turn positive , thus resulting in a first - order transition becoming continuous in the presence of defects , as observed in v@xmath0h .",
    "note that a correction to @xmath58 due to the ordering process exists also in an undefected material .",
    "however , at least in the beginning of the nucleation of the new phase in the disordered material , this correction is not greater than the one in the skin - layer discussed above@xcite .",
    "in fact , when the ordered phase starts to nucleate in a perfect crystal , the shape of the nucleus is that of an infinitely thin platelet  @xcite .",
    "the strain energy density contribution of the infinitesimal platelet is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a linear function of the strains and @xmath159 is the unitary vector minimizing @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "as before , the strains being proportional to @xmath153 , the equation above yields an effective correction on the fourth - order term .    on the other hand , we have seen that the shape of the nucleus in the skin - layer is that of an infinitesimal cylindrical rod . then , eq .  [ a4b ] becomes @xmath160 where the brackets indicate the angular average of @xmath158 .",
    "since the average of a quantity is never smaller than its minimum , the correction in the skin layer due to an infinitesimal nucleus can not be smaller than the one in the bulk .",

    "the ordered regions are thicker and now touch , the correlation length is longer than the average distance between dislocation walls , and the order is spreading throughout the network of regions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    recalling eq .  [ totaldispl ] , we notice that the more the order spreads , the more the domain over which the intergral is carried out is reduced .",
    "moreover , the contributions in the integral are weighted with the square of the distance to the point to which they apply .",
    "thus , with growing regions , the magnitude of the displacement vector will steadily decrease .",
    "also , the displacement vector field will become spatially increasingly homogeneous , especially in points not too close to the borders .",
    "therefore , the components of the strain tensor will decrease as well , since we know from eq .",
    "[ displtens ] that they depend on the derivatives of the total displacement vector components , which are changing smoothly .",
    "the fact that the correction to @xmath58 is proportional to the square of a linear combination of strain tensor components ( eq .  [ a4corr ] ) guarantees that its value will be small and positive throughout the new transition .",
    "if this is added to a small negative `` original '' fourth  order coefficient , as it is the case in v@xmath0h , whose bulk transition is first order , it will make @xmath58 effectively vanish , thereby making the transition behavior tricritical , and , because the upper critical dimension of this tricritical theory is 3 , causing the mean - field values of the exponents that are observed experimentally .",
    "note that below a certain temperature where the wall lines have ordered independently , the walls consist of domains with order parameter of opposite signs . in the case of a complex framework of dislocation walls which intersect and interact with each other , on further lowering the temperature ,",
    "one of the two signs will eventually spread throughout the network until the order parameter has the same sign everywhere ( see also fig .",
    "[ cylreg ] ) .",
    "the mechanism for tricriticality also provides an explanation for the depth - dependence of the crossover temperature .",
    "in fact , the density of defects decreases with depth .",
    "thus , in order for the domain of the integral in eq .  [ totaldispl ] to be sufficiently reduced , the temperature needs to be decreased more at greater depths .",
    "consequently , the correlation length @xmath161 has to increase more at greater depths than it has to in layers closer to the surface in order to reach the critical point .",
    "in other words , for the same change in reduced temperature , the change in correlation length is higher for shallower depths .",
    "the corresponding scaling law should then be modified so that the coefficient depend on depth : @xmath162 in particular , it is reasonable to expect @xmath163 to be proportional to the density of defects , as it is in fact observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism provides an explanation as to why experimental measurements of @xmath161 at different depths yield different values even if taken at corresponding reduced temperatures , once the depth - dependence of the critical temperature has been accounted for , and even though the critical exponent remains the same .",
    "a treatment to collapse the data onto a single curve , including corrections for the experimental method used , has been proposed and verified in ref .  .",
    "as the temperature is lowered below the critical point , the remaining material between the walls orders and a second , distinct , phase transition occurs .",
    "however , considering eq .",
    "[ totaldispl ] again , we notice that the correction only applies to the material inside the `` skeleton '' of ors .",
    "therefore , for the material that is still between the ors , the fourth - order coefficient is still negative . in such regions",
    "the transition is still first - order , but it is weaker than it is in an undefected crystal .    because this transition is only weakly first - order , a critical exponent @xmath37 associated with it can still be measured as shown in fig .  [ beta ] .",
    "the measured values are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "such values confirm that the transition regime is not tricritical , since in that case one would expect a mean field exponent @xmath164  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a theoretical model which explains the two - length - scale phenomena and related behavior observed experimentally in many materials , including the unusual ordering behavior observed in v@xmath0h . in particular , the depth - dependence of the critical temperature in the skin layer , reported recently @xcite , is shown to be caused by the strain field induced by the presence of walls of dislocations .",
    "the ordering process itself crosses over between two regimes , causing the experimentally observed crossover in the values of the critical exponents .",
    "the additional strains induced by the formation of the ordered regions are responsible for increasing the effective value of the fourth - order coefficient in a ginzburg - landau free energy density expansion , thereby allowing the transition to become continuous in the skin layer even if it is first - order in the bulk as we find in v@xmath0h .",
    "furthermore , the strength of this correction weakens during the spreading of the order through the network , driving the value of the fourth - order coefficient to zero , thus producing tricritical behavior and mean - field values of the critical exponents .",
    "thus , when the temperature is lowered , first a continuous transition happens along the dislocations as described .",
    "then , at a still lower temperature , the material between the cylindrical regions orders . however , it undergoes a transition that is first order , similar to the one that takes place in the bulk but weaker .",
    "the model also explains why , in the mean - field regime , the critical region has a depth - dependent size .",
    "although in this paper we have specifically considered the case of v@xmath0h , the theoretical framework that we have developed should be broadly applicable for understanding ordering behavior in defective materials , particularly those that have an anisotropic distribution of defects .",
    "we considered a situation in which the bulk , and the material in between the interconnected network of cylindrical regions in the skin layer , orders through first - order transitions .",
    "however , the model we have developed is easily adaptable to a situation where the transition in between the cylindrical regions is continuous , and to a situation where both transitions are continuous . in the latter case , though , we would not expect to see a crossover in the scaling behavior of the central peak of the skin layer cds .",
