    "since its recent discovery , graphene a monolayer of graphite has become the subject of intense research due to its peculiar electronic properties @xcite .",
    "the unusual properties of graphene are largely a result of the linear dispersion of electron bands at low energies and its two - dimensionality .",
    "this allows to describe the charge carriers in graphene as a two - dimensional gas of massless dirac - fermions .",
    "the unusual electronic properties and the fact that its chemical potential can easily be tuned by a gate voltage make graphene an ideal experimental testing ground for exotic physics as well as a promising basis for novel nano - electronics devices . for recent reviews of this rapidly developing field and additional references , see e.g. refs . .",
    "graphene is also a good testing ground for exotic kondo physics@xcite : first , the linearly vanishing dos of graphene favours the formation of a local moment @xcite which is a necessary condition for kondo physics . also vacancies and edge defects in graphene have been predicted to give rise to magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "very recently , the kondo effect has actually been observed at local defects in graphene providing evidence that defects in graphene are indeed magnetic @xcite . on the other hand , as a result of the linearly vanishing dos , a magnetic moment coupled to a graphene layer can only display a kondo effect if the strength of the coupling is strong enough@xcite .",
    "furthermore because of the existence of two inequivalent dirac cones , it has multiple channels which can in principle screen the impurity spin and could therefore lead to a multichannel kondo effect and hence non - fermi liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "kondo effect and the possibilty of multichannel kondo effect in graphene have been discussed in a number of recent publications @xcite .    moreover , it is possible to probe the kondo effect of magnetic adatoms on graphene by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "similar to stm spectroscopy of magnetic adatoms and molecules on metallic surfaces @xcite , the kondo effect could show up as fano lineshapes in the conductance vs. bias voltage characteristics of the stm or as additional temperature dependent peaks in the stm spectra .",
    "but in comparison with normal metallic surfaces the fano lineshapes for graphene are expected to be more asymmetric and strongly dependend on the symmetry of the @xmath1-orbitals of magnetic atom @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to perform a realistic study of the kondo effect for a single co adatom on an otherwise perfect graphene sheet by using a recently developed approach for nanoscopic systems that combines _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations on the level of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations with a full dynamical treatment of the strongly interacting @xmath0-electrons @xcite .",
    "a realistic treatment allows us to investigate under which conditions the kondo effect takes place in a given orbital and the detailed spectral functions that arise from the kondo effect in a semi - metallic substrate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we briefly describe our recently developed gga+oca",

    "ab initio _ description of the electronic structure of nanoscopic systems fully taking into account dynamical correlations by combining dft calculations with a dynamical treatment of the strongly interacting @xmath0-electrons in the so - called one - crossing approximation ( oca ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : dft - results ] we present dft electronic structure calculations in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for determining the most favourable adsorption site for the co atom on the graphene sheet . in agreement with previous results by other groups@xcite",
    "we find that the hollow site is the most favourable adsorption site .",
    "using hybrid functional calculations which generally predict better geometries for molecules we have then optimized the adsorption height of the co atom at the hollow site of the graphene . using gga",
    "we have also calculated the charge and spin of the co atom in dependence of the distance to the graphene sheet for the three different adsorption sites .",
    "the plots indicate that depending on the distance the co atom can be either in the local moment regime or in weak correlation regime .",
    "since the potential energy curves are very shallow it seems feasible that the correlation regime be controlled via the distance of the co atom to the graphene substrate in an actual experiment .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : oca - results ] we study the impact of dynamical correlations of the co @xmath0-electrons on the elctronic structure of the co atom and the graphene sheet using the gga+oca method for nanoscopic systems as described in sec . [ sec : method ] .",
    "we find that the dynamical correlations of the co @xmath0-electrons give rise to strongly temperature - dependent peaks near the fermi level in the spectral density of the co @xmath0-shell but also in the spectral density of the @xmath2-orbitals of nearby carbon atoms .",
    "furthermore , we find that the co @xmath0-spectra depend quite strongly on the exact energies of the co @xmath0-levels . accordingly",
    ", the application of a gate voltage which changes the chemical potential of the graphene substrate has a similar effect on the spectra .",
    "hence the dynamic correlations and the kondo effect can be controlled by the application of a gate voltage .    finally , in sec .",

    "analogously , we obtain an effective mean - field description of the host material from a gga calculation for a supercell of clean graphene corresponding to the c region .",

    "should be reduced compared to its bulk value . here",
    "we take @xmath11  ev and @xmath12  ev as in our previous work@xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction within the correlated @xmath0 subspace has already been taken into account on a static mean - field level in the effective ks hamiltonian of the central unit cell c. therefore the ks hamiltonian within the correlated subspace @xmath13 has to be corrected by a double - counting correction term , i.e. @xmath14 . here",

    "the impurity problem is completely determined by the interacting hamiltonian of the co @xmath0-shell , i.e. @xmath19 , and by the so - called hybridization function @xmath20 which describes the dynamic hybridization of the co @xmath0-shell with the rest of the system ( i.e. the bath )",

    "we make use of impurity solvers based on an expansion in the hybridization strength given by @xmath25 around the atomic limit .",

    "the hybridization of the impurity subspace with the rest of the system ( given by the hybridization function @xmath25 ) is then treated perturbatively .",
    "the so - called non - crossing approximation ( nca ) is a self - consistent perturbation expansion to lowest order in the hybridization strength .",

    "[ fig : nca+oca ] in app .",

    "improves upon the nca by taking into account second order diagrams where two additional electrons ( holes ) are acommodated on the impurity at the same time in addition to the nca diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nca+oca ] .",
    "oca is the lowest order self - consistent approximation that is exact up to first order in the hybridization @xmath27 for all physical quantities while nca is only exact to first order in @xmath28 for the conduction electron self - energy .",
    "oca improves considerably many of the shortcomings of nca : it substantially improves the width of the kondo peak and hence the kondo temperature which now are only slightly underestimated .",
    "it also corrects the asymmetry of the kondo peak . for very low temperatures ( @xmath29 ) , however , the height of the kondo peak is still overestimated , and the fermi liquid behaviour at zero temperature is not recovered .",
    "hence , oca is a reasonable approximation for solving the generalized impurity problem as long as the temperatures are not too low ( i.e. more than one order of magnitude below @xmath30 ) . in app .",

    "[ fig : graphene+co ] shows the hybridization functions for each symmetry group .",
    "as can be seen at low energies the @xmath32-orbital ( a@xmath31 ) has an essentially flat and zero hybridization with the graphene sheet .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the coupling of the @xmath32 on the hollow site to the @xmath38-orbitals of the graphene sheet is zero due to symmetry considerations @xcite .",
    "the e@xmath35-group has the ( overall ) strongest coupling to the c @xmath38-orbitals in that geometry as can be seen from the corresponding hybridization function .",
    "note that the hybridization function for both the e@xmath31 and e@xmath35 symmetry group vanish linearly near the fermi energy reflecting the linear dos of the graphene sheet .",
    "interestingly , the slopes for the e@xmath31- and e@xmath35-hybridization functions are different for energies below and above the fermi level .",
    "morover , for negative energies the e@xmath31-hybridization function has a steeper slope than the e@xmath35-hybridization , while for positive energies it is the other way round .",
    "this implies that e@xmath31 couples predominantly to the negative energy band of graphene while @xmath39 couples predominantly to the positive energy band .    in table .",

    "taking into account the real part of the hybridization changes also the ordering of the energy levels .",
    "for the ordering of the effective energy levels we obtain : @xmath42 . note that this level ordering is similar to the one obtained by wehling _",
    "et al._@xcite .",

    "( [ eq : hdcc ] ) and taking the gga value of about 7.5 for @xmath17 . with oca , the total occupation of the impurity @xmath0-shell is now between 7.1 and 7.0 at low temperatures compared to the gga value of 7.5 .",
    "this result is very typical for correlated calculations : the correlations push the system towards integer occupation numbers to lower the energy .    fig .",
    "[ fig : oca - results ] shows the spectral functions of the co @xmath0-electrons for different temperatures calculated with oca . at high temperatures we find peaks near the fermi level for all three symmetry groups .",
    "however , the temperature dependencies of the individual peaks are quite different from each other : for the a@xmath31-symmetry consisting of the @xmath43-orbital the peak becomes smaller at increasing temperatures and finally develops a step - like behaviour at low temperatures .",
    "the peaks in the e@xmath31 and e@xmath35-spectra on the other hand become more pronounced with decreasing temperature more or less as expected for kondo effect .",
    "the form of the spectral functions and the temperature behaviour can be understood by looking at the occupation numbers for the different symmetry groups .",
    "the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : oca - results](a - c ) show the occupation numbers as a function of temperature for each of the three symmetry groups . for the a@xmath31-symmetry",
    "the occupation changes from @xmath441.6 at high temperatures to almost 2 at low temperatures .",
    "hence , at low temperatures the @xmath43-orbital is practically completely filled , and excitations near the fermi level are suppressed . for the e@xmath31-symmetry group composed of the @xmath45- and @xmath46-orbitals the occupation changes from 2.8 at high temperatures to 2.1 at low temperatures .",
    "hence at low temperatures this doubly - degenerate channel is essentially half - filled , corresponding to a spin of almost 1 in this channel due to hund s rule coupling .",
    "the peak near the fermi level in the e@xmath31-spectral function is hence due to a spin-1 kondo effect in this channel . for the e@xmath35-symmetry composed of the @xmath47- and @xmath48-orbitals we find an occupation of 2.8 for high temperatures , and of almost 3 for low temperatures . hence the doubly - degenerate e@xmath35-channel accomodates 3 electrons with a total spin-1/2 so that the peak in the e@xmath35-spectral function is due to a spin-1/2 kondo effect .",
    "accordingly , the peaks near the fermi level in the @xmath0-spectral function at low temperature are due to a spin-3/2 kondo effect in the @xmath0-levels .",
    "this interpretation is further corroborated by the fact that the main contribution to the electronic configuration of the @xmath0-shell is an eightfold degenerate state with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the very fact that such a high spin state can be screened by the graphene substrate is an evidence of the multi - channel character of the graphene as a conduction electron bath .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : oca - results](e ) we compare the @xmath0-spectral density calculated with the gga+oca ( at @xmath51  k ) method on the one hand and with spin - polarized gga on the other hand .",
    "as can be seen the spectral densities calculated by the two methods differ significantly from each other . in the gga spectrum , the peak just below the fermi level ( see also the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : oca - results](e ) ) corresponds to a completely filled @xmath52-shell with down - spin as can be seen by comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene+co](c ) .",

    ", the two peaks near the fermi level in the gga+oca spectra which are also of @xmath52- and @xmath39-symmetry , do not carry the full spectral weight of the corresponding orbitals due to the renormalization of the quasi - particle by the electron - electron interactions which can not be captured by a static mean - field calculation like gga .",
    "[ fig : oca - results](d ) shows that the correlations in the co @xmath0-shell also affect the projected dos of the @xmath2-orbitals on the carbon atoms that are directly coupled to the co atom ( i.e. the 6 carbon atoms nearest to the co atom ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows : due to the coupling between the carbon @xmath2- and the co @xmath0-orbitals , the full @xmath53-green s function @xmath54 is related to the full green s of the @xmath0-orbitals @xmath55 by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the green s function of the ( unperturbed ) graphene @xmath2-orbitals without the coupling to the co @xmath0-orbitals and @xmath58 is the coupling between the @xmath2- and individual @xmath0-orbitals .",

    "quite obviously there is a drastic change in the correlations when the impurity - levels are lowered by more than 0.2  ev . at that point , a substantial peak appears in the a@xmath31-spectra , while the peak in the e@xmath31-spectra disappears .",
    "the peak in the e@xmath35-spectra on the other hand becomes qualitatively different for energy shifts @xmath64  ev , i.e. their spectral weight increases considerably",
    ". the changes in the spectra are accompanied by changes in the occupancies : most importantly , the occupancy of the e@xmath35-levels increases abruptly by about 0.6 for @xmath65  ev .",
    "the changes in the @xmath0-levels with a@xmath31- and e@xmath31-symmetry are less pronounced but also occur at the same point .",
    "also the overall occupation of the impurity levels changes quite abruptly by about 0.5 electrons from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "this indicates a strong change in the electronic configuration of the co @xmath0-shell .",
    "indeed we find that for an energy shift around -0.2  ev , another @xmath0-shell state with @xmath68 and @xmath69 becomes similar in energy to the state with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "hence , at this point the system enters the mixed - valence regime .",
    "this explains the strong increase of the spectral weight in the e@xmath35-peak for @xmath64  ev since the mixed - valence regime is characterized by a strong peak near the fermi level . on the other hand ,",
    "the integer occupation of 2 in the e@xmath31-levels , and the associated spin-1 , essentially does not change upon entering the mixed - valence regime .",
    "in fact , the occupation is now even closer to 2 than it was in the kondo regime .",
    "also the occupation of the a@xmath31-level remains essentially constant upon entering the mixed - valence regime .",
    "hence the mixed - valence is actually only induced in the e@xmath35-levels since the occupations of the a@xmath31-level and the e@xmath31-levels in the @xmath68 state are the same as in the @xmath49 state .",
    "the vanishing of the peak in the e@xmath31-spectra upon entering the mixed - valence regime is due to the weaker hybridization with the graphene for negative energies ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene+co ] ) : as the kondo peak in the e@xmath31-levels moves beyond the dirac point as the impurity - levels are lowered in energy , the kondo coupling in the e@xmath31-levels becomes weaker and the kondo temperature much smaller so that the kondo effect is not observed anymore at the temperatures considered here .",
    "it is not quite clear what triggers the peak in the a@xmath31-spectra upon entering the mixed - valence regime .",
    "one possibility is that the increased charge fluctuations in the mixed valence regime also lead to charge fluctuations in this level via the hund s rule coupling to the other @xmath0-levels .",
    "the slight decrease in the occupation of the a@xmath31-level in the mixed - valence regime supports this view .",
    "note that the position of a peak ( if present ) changes according to the energy shift .",
    "this also explains the change in the width of the peaks for the e@xmath31- and e@xmath35- symmetries : as a peak moves away from the fermi level the broadening increases due to the increased hybridization with the graphene substrate .",
    "the a@xmath31-level on the other hand does not couple at all to the graphene substrate ( zero hybridization ) so that the changes in the shape of the a@xmath31-peak are purely correlation effects .    hence tuning the energies of the co @xmath0-levels",
    "changes the correlations in these levels due to changes in the occupancy .",
    "more precisely , the system is driven from the kondo regime to the mixed - valence regime when the energies of the @xmath0-levels are lowered by more than 0.2  ev with respect to their original energies .",
    "the change in the correlations is reflected by corresponding changes in the @xmath0-spectral functions .          in the previous subsection",
    "we have seen that changing the exact position of the co @xmath0-levels with respect to the fermi level has a considerable effect on the electronic correlations and hence on the spectral density of the @xmath0-levels .",
    "although changing the impurity levels directly is not feasible in an experiment , one can instead easily tune the chemical potential of graphene by application of a gate voltage .",
    "the chemical potential then is shifted with respect to both , the impurity levels and the graphene bands .",
    "hence it should be possible to control the electronic correlations and in particular the kondo effect by application of a gate voltage .",
    "the change in correlations can then be detected in the @xmath0-spectra for example by stm spectroscopy .",
    "more precisely , a gate voltage @xmath70 shifts the chemical potential @xmath71 with respect to the graphene bands and the impurity levels according to @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the elementary charge and @xmath74 is the fermi level of neutral graphene , i.e. the energy of the dirac points ( see inset of fig .",

    "there the width of the e@xmath31- and e@xmath35-peaks increased as they moved away from the fermi level due to the linear increase of the hybridization with the graphene substrate . here , however , the peak is pinned to the dirac point of graphene , i.e. it moves together with the graphene bands with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "hence the hybridization with the graphene conduction electrons does not change here .",
    "the strong dependence of the width of the resonance on the gate voltage for negative gate voltages on the other hand is due to the changes in the electronic correlations as the system is driven out of the kondo regime .",
    "using dft electronic structure calculations we have found that a single co atom most likely adsorbs at the hollow site of an otherwise clean graphene sheet .",
    "furthermore the dft calculations show , that the magnetic moment and the electronic configuration of the @xmath0-shell of the co atom depends quite strongly on the adsorption height over the graphene sheet . at large distantes",
    "the formation of a local moment is favoured while at short distances the magnetic moment is quenched due to strong hybridization with the substrate .",
    "since the adsorption energy curves are quite shallow , it might be possible in an experiment to push the co atom from the local moment to the weakly correlated regime .",
    "using our gga+oca correlated electronic structure method for nanoscopic systems , we have then studied the impact of dynamical correlations due to the strongly interacting co @xmath0-electrons on the electronic structure .",
    "because of the strong crystal field splitting of the @xmath0-levels by graphene substrate , the behaviour of each of the co @xmath0-levels strongly depends on its orbital symmetry .",
    "we find that the dynamic correlations can give rise to a spin-3/2 kondo effect .",
    "the spin-3/2 is composed of a spin-1 due to two electrons within the doubly - degenerate orbitals of e@xmath31-symmetry and a spin-1/2 due to a hole within the doubly - degenerate orbitals of the e@xmath35-symmetry .",
    "the kondo effect gives rise to corresponding peaks near the fermi level in the e@xmath31- and e@xmath35-spectral function .",
    "the a@xmath31-channel on the other hand is nearly completely filled and hence in the kondo regime , it does not give rise to a peak near the fermi level .",
    "the realization of a spin-3/2 kondo effect points to the multi - channel character of graphene .",
    "hence a spin-1/2 impurity could in principle give rise to multi - channel kondo physics and non - fermi liquid behaviour .",
    "the kondo effect can be controlled by a gate voltage which changes the chemical potential and thereby the filling of the @xmath0-levels .",
    "the change in the correlations can be observed by a stark change in the spectra as the system is driven out of the kondo regime and into the mixed valence regime .",
    "another remarkable result is that the kondo peaks appear to be pinned to the dirac point of the graphene substrate rather than to the chemical potential when a gate voltage is applied .",
    "this last finding is actually in agreement with very recent stm spectroscopy measurements of co atoms on graphene which find peaks in the di / dv curves that move according to the applied gate voltage@xcite .",
    "but it has not yet been pointed out by other theoretical work considering the dependence of the kondo effect in graphene on a gate - voltage @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to sasha balatzky , kostyantyn kechedzhi and rgis decker for useful discussions , and to kristjan haule for providing us with the oca impurity solver .",
    "part of this research was carried out at the kitp in the program `` towards material design with correlated electrons '' .",
    "gk was supported by nsf - dmr-0906943 .",
    "here we show how to compute the embedding self - energy @xmath80 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gc ] ) that describes the dynamic hybridization of the central region c with the rest of the system ( i.e. the graphene sheet ) .",
    "first , we obtain an effective mean - field description of the host material from a gga calculation for a supercell of clean graphene corresponding to the c region . from the kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath81 of the host material in reciprocal space",
    "we calculate the @xmath82-dependent green s function : @xmath83 the local ks hamiltonian of the supercell is obtained by summing up @xmath81 over all k - points within the brillouin zone : @xmath84 similarly , the local green s function of the supercell is given by summing up @xmath85 over all k - points within the brillouin zone : @xmath86 on the other hand , we can write the local green s function also in terms of the local hamiltonian @xmath87 of the supercell and the embedding self - energy ( which describes the dynamic hyrbidization with the rest of the graphene ) as : @xmath88^{-1}$ ] . hence the embedding self - energy is given by : @xmath89^{-1}\\ ] ]",
    "the general multi - orbital anderson impurity model can be written in the following form : @xmath90 where in order to keep the notation simple we have combined the spin- and orbital degrees of freedom into one index for each impurity level @xmath91 and each band @xmath92 .    the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) and the one - crossing approximation ( oca ) both solve the anderson impurity model by expansion in the hybridization strength around the atomic limit .",
    "the starting point is an exact diagonalization of the impurity subspace , i.e. of the co @xmath0-shell in our case , including the hubbard - like interaction term : @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the many - body eigenstates of @xmath26 and @xmath95 the respective eigen energies .",
    "one now introduces auxiliary fields @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( called pseudo - particles ) such that each impurity state is represented by a corresponding pseudo - particle : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the pseudo - particle vacuum .",
    "the completeness of the impurity eigenstates imposes the following constraint : @xmath100 the physical electron operators @xmath101 can now be expressed by the pp operators : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the matrix elements of the impurity - electron creation operator . for later convenience",
    "we also define the corresponding matrix elements of the impurity - electron destruction operator as : @xmath104 .",
    "the anti - commutation rules for the physical electron operators then require that the pp @xmath96 is a boson ( fermion ) if the corresponding state @xmath94 contains an even ( odd ) number of electrons .    in the pp representation we can now rewrite the hamiltonian of the generalized anderson impurity model as follows : @xmath105 where we have included the constraint @xmath106 into the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding lagrange multiplier @xmath107 can be interpreted as a ( negative ) chemical potential for the pps .    in the pp picture , the hybridization with the bath electrons given by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp - aim ] ) becomes now the interaction for the pps .",
    "because of the fermionic and bosonic commutation rules for the pps , one can now develop a diagrammatic perturbation expansion in the pp interaction .",
    "the pp propagators can then be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the pp self - energy describing the dynamic interaction with the other pps .",
    "the non - crossing approximation consists in taken into account the diagrams shown in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : nca+oca ] for a certain pseudo - particle .",
    "the nca diagrams describe processes where a single electron ( hole ) jumps from the bath to the impurity and back thereby temporarily creating a pp with n+1 ( n-1 ) electrons .",
    "the nca equations correspond to a self - consistent perturbation expansion to lowest order in the hybridization function @xmath110 .",
    "since the fermionic self - energies depend on the dressed bosonic propagators , and vice versa , the nca equations have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "once the nca equations are solved the physical quantities can be calculated from the pp self - energies .",
    "oca takes into account second order diagrams where two bath electron lines cross as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : nca+oca ] .",
    "the self - energies for the fermions ( bosons ) again depend on the full propagators for bosons ( fermions ) , and hence the oca equations have to be solved self - consistently .",
    "the explicit expressions for the oca self - energies are second in the bath hybridization function @xmath111 .",
    "the oca is the lowest order self - consistent approximation that is exact up to first order in the hybridization @xmath27 for all physical quantities while nca is only exact to first order in @xmath28 in the pp and conduction electron self - energies .",
    "further details of the nca and oca impurity solver can be found e.g. in refs . .",
