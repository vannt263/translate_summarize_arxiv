    "the existence of yukawa - type long - range interactions between the atoms of macro - bodies is predicted by the modern unified gauge - field theories of fundamental interactions , from the principles of supersymmetry and supergravity .",
    "these forces may be understood as a result of the exchange of light elementary particles ( such as the axion , scalar axion , dilaton , spin - one antigraviton etc .",
    "they may be called _ long - range _ because their range of action is much larger than the typical nuclear sizes .",
    "additional yukawa - type interactions may arise also from corrections to the newtonian gravitational law at small distances @xcite . at present , this subject is actively investigated .",
    "there are a large number of papers from both theoreticians and experimentalists . an extended annotative collection of references can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most reliable way to get constraints on the parameters of the yukawa - type long - range interactions is via laboratory experiments which are sensitive to the presence of additional forces .",
    "examples are the etvs- , galileo- and cavendish - type experiments , casimir and van der waals force measurements , and measurements of transition probabilities in exotic atoms .",
    "a collection of modern constraints following from the above - mentioned experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "casimir forces which arise between closely located surfaces of solid bodies due to the presence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations provide us with one of the most interesting possibilities to restrict the permissable strength of the hypothetical interaction .",
    "a detailed analysis of the casimir effect , including those aspect under discussion here can be found in the monograph @xcite .",
    "it was first suggested in @xcite that constraints on the yukawa - type interactions can be derived from the casimir effect .",
    "the strongest constraints , which follow from the casimir force measurement between a quartz plate and a spherical lens , were obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they provide the strongest constraints for a range @xmath0 of the yukawa forces within @xmath1 . for @xmath2 the best constraints followed from the cavendish- and etvs - type experiments @xcite and for @xmath3 from van der waals force measurements and from measurements of transition probabilities in exotic atoms @xcite .",
    "therefore new , more exact casimir force measurements are of prime importance in order to obtain stronger constraints on the constants of yukawa - type hypothetical interactions in the intermediate range of @xmath0 .",
    "recently , a new experiment was performed @xcite , in which the casimir force was measured between two metallised surfaces , a plane disc and a spherical lens with a distance @xmath4 between them .",
    "the theoretical value , obtained in @xcite , was confirmed within an accuracy of 5% in the distance region @xmath5 .",
    "note that this was the first direct measurement of the casimir force for metallic surfaces since sparnaay @xcite , and that the accuracy has been increased in 20 times .",
    "the metallic surface of the bodies ( a @xmath6 thick gold layer ) increased considerably the contribution of the hypothetical yukawa forces due to the high density of gold ( the yukawa forces are proportional to the density squared ) . also , the relatively large spacing between the bodies , up to @xmath7 , where the casimir force is very small , turned out to be essential for the strengthening of the constraints .    in the present paper",
    "new constraints on parameters of the yukawa - type hypothetical interactions , which follow from the experiment @xcite on casimir force measurement , are obtained .",
    "they turn out to be stronger than those obtained previously from the measurement of the casimir force between dielectrics and from one of the versions of a cavendish - type experiment in the range @xmath8 . especially within @xmath9",
    ", they are stronger than the previously known ones by about @xmath10 times and near @xmath11 , they are @xmath12 times stronger .",
    "the corresponding constraints which result for the masses of the spin - one antigraviton and for the dilaton are also discussed .",
    "in the recent experiment @xcite the casimir force was measured between a plane disc of diameter @xmath13 and thickness @xmath14 and a lens of height @xmath15 , diameter @xmath16 and curvature radius @xmath17 .",
    "the surfaces of the plate and the lens were covered with copper and gold layers of @xmath6 thickness each ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for this configuration",
    "the casimir force is attractive and given by @xcite @xmath18 this expression was later obtained by another method in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    "it is an approximation but , as shown in @xcite , for a large radius - of - curvature lens , the relative error is less than 0.01% .",
    "the potential of the hypothetical interaction between the atoms of the disc and the atoms in the lens has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the interatomic distance , @xmath21 is the ( dimensionless ) interaction constant , @xmath22 is the range of the interaction and simultaneously the compton wavelength of the hypothetical particles whose exchange leads to the hypothetical forces under discussion .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 are the numbers of nucleons in the atoms so that the constant @xmath21 is independent of the type of atoms , i.e. , on the nuclear charges .    due to its smallness the hypothetical interaction between solid bodies",
    "can be obtained by summing the potential ( [ 2 ] ) over their volumes @xmath24\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\left [   \\tilde{\\rho}_{1}\\int_{\\tilde{v}_{1}}{\\rm d^{3}}{\\bf r}_{2}+    \\rho_{2}\\int_{\\tilde{v}_{2}}{\\rm d^{3}}{\\bf r}_{2}+    \\rho_{3}\\int_{\\tilde{v}_{3}}{\\rm d^{3}}{\\bf r}_{2}\\right ] { \\exp(-r/\\lambda)\\over r}\\ ; , \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 belong to the volumes indicated in the lower integration limits in the operator brackets .",
    "this formula reflects the composition of the disc and the lens , both having metal layers , used in the experiment . in ( [ 3 ] ) , by means of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the proton mass , we introduced the densities of the materials used in the experiment : @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the quartz in the disc and the lens , respectively and @xmath32 for the copper and gold layers ( @xmath33 being the _ atomic _ densities ) .    using this formula ,",
    "the hypothetical force between the disc and the lens can be expressed as @xmath34    the integrals in these expressions can not be taken explicitely . in general , numerical integration is required ( see below ) . however , if the part of the lens , which contributes most to the result is small compared with the disc , the integrals in ( [ 3 ] ) can easily be taken explicitely .",
    "this approximation is in any case justified for @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , its validity can be extended up to @xmath36 as the numerical calculations show .      performing the integration in ( [ 9 ] )",
    "we obtain the final expression for the force @xmath57 between an infinite disc and the lens : @xmath58\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\big\\{2\\lambda\\rho_3(r-\\lambda)-2\\lambda(\\rho_3-\\rho_2 ) ( r-\\delta-\\lambda){\\rm e}^{-\\delta/\\lambda } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2\\lambda ( \\rho_2-\\tilde{\\rho_1 } ) ( r-2\\delta-\\lambda){\\rm e}^{-2\\delta/\\lambda } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left[2r\\lambda\\tilde{\\rho_1}\\left(-1+{\\lambda/ r}-{h / \\lambda}+{h/ r}+ { h^2/ 2r\\lambda}\\right ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\delta^2(\\rho_3 + 3\\rho_2 - 4\\tilde{\\rho_1})- 2r\\delta(\\rho_2+\\rho_3 - 2\\tilde{\\rho_1})\\right]{\\rm e}^{-h/\\lambda}\\big\\}\\;.   \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the expression ( [ 1 ] ) for the casimir force acting between a flat plate and a spherical lens was confirmed experimentally in @xcite for a range of distance @xmath59 with a relative error of @xmath60 .",
    "this means that the value of the hypothetical forces can not surpass five percents of the casimir force .",
    "consequently the inequality @xmath61 where @xmath62 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) or , in the case of sufficiently small @xmath0 by eq . ( [ 15 ] ) , holds .    from the inequality ( [ 16 ] ) the constraints on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath0 of the hypothetical force @xmath62 follow .",
    "we consider this in what follows .",
    "note that for the range @xmath63 the force is well approximated by the simple formula following from ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath64 using ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 17 ] ) , the inequality ( [ 16 ] ) may be written in the form @xmath65 it is seen from ( [ 18 ] ) that the strength of the constraint in this range does not depend on @xmath66 , the radius of the lens .    for the range",
    "@xmath67 the constraints are obtained using formula ( [ 15 ] ) . for the range",
    "@xmath68 it is impossible to consider the radius of the disc as large and a numerical integration in formula ( [ 3 ] ) was performed . for this purpose algorithm 698 from netlib ( http://www.netlib.org ) was used .",
    "it is an adaptive multidimensional integration , the fortran program is called dcuhre. a large number of function calls ( about @xmath69 ) for @xmath70 was necessary in order to obtain reliable numerical values . for smaller @xmath0 the program does not work , but there the radius of the disc becomes unimportant and formula ( [ 15 ] ) can be used . note that , e.g. , for @xmath71 m the hypothetical force acting between the lens and the finite disc is 72.3% of the force for an infinite disc . for @xmath72",
    "m it is already 99.96% .",
    "the values of the geometrical parameters used in @xcite are given in sec .",
    "the densities of the materials of the disc and of the lens are @xmath73 for the quartz in the lens and @xmath74 for the quartz in the disc , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for copper and gold , correspondingly .",
    "the results of all calculations are collected into inequality ( [ 16 ] ) in order to obtain the new constraints on the constants of hypothetical long - range interactions .",
    "the obtained constraints are shown by curve 1 in fig .",
    "2 , where the region above the curve is ruled out by the cited experimental data .",
    "thereby for every value of @xmath0 the value of @xmath4 was used which gives the best constraint .",
    "this is @xmath77 for large @xmath0 and @xmath78 for small @xmath0 and correspondingly in between . for comparison , in the same fig .",
    "2 the curve 2 shows the previously known @xcite constraints for the yukawa - type hypothetical interactions which follow from the experiment @xcite on casimir force measuring . in that experiment",
    "the lens and the disc ( it was large as compared with the lens ) were made out from quartz only ( without metallic layers on the surfaces ) .",
    "the dependence ( [ 1 ] ) with an appropriate correction factor due to the dielectricity was confirmed with a relative error of @xmath79 for distances @xmath80 . as a result , for extremely small @xmath81 the experiment @xcite gave stronger constraints than the experiment @xcite .",
    "this constraint results from the smallest values @xmath82 .",
    "this becomes clear when taking into account that the function @xmath83 appearing in ( [ 18 ] ) takes its minimal value for @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the experiment @xcite with the smallest value of @xmath4 gives the best results in this case .",
    "for @xmath85 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , the experiment under consideration gives much stronger constraints than that of @xcite .",
    "in the range @xmath86 the new constraints surpass the old ones by more than a factor of 1000 and near @xmath87 , by 3000 . for @xmath88 , where the old casimir experiment has given the same constraints as one of the cavendish - type experiments , the increase is 400 times .",
    "the constraints which follow from the cavendish- and etvs - type experiments are also shown in fig . 2 @xcite . curve 3 follows from the experiment @xcite , curve 4 from @xcite and curve 5 from @xcite , curve 6 from the etvs - type experiment @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , in the range @xmath89 the new constraints from the casimir effect surpass in some points the results from the cavendish - type experiment in ref . @xcite , in some points they are of the same strength ( compare the curves 1 and 3 in fig .",
    "the new constraints resulting from the recent casimir force measurement ( in distinction from the old ones ) give the possibility to get constraints for the masses of the spin - one antigraviton and the dilaton .",
    "the exchange of spin - one antigravitons gives rise to repulsive forces described by ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the sum of the masses of the current quarks belonging to a nucleus and of atomic electrons , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "this gives @xmath92 and from curve 1 of fig .",
    "2 it follows that @xmath93 , or for the spin - one antigraviton mass , @xmath94 . this constraint is only slightly weaker than the previous one ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xcite ) obtained from the cavendish - type experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ( shown as curve 4 in fig .",
    "a similar constraint follows for the dilaton whose interaction constant is given by theory to be @xmath97 . as seen from fig .",
    "2 , for such a constant @xmath98 or , in terms of the dilaton mass , @xmath99 follows .",
    "quite the same constraint follows from the cavendish - type experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ( shown as curve 3 in fig .",
    "therefore in the region @xmath100 the constraints following from the casimir effect are approximately of the same strength as those which follow from cavendish - type experiments .",
    "as discussed in the preceeding sections , the new measurement of the casimir force presented in @xcite makes it possibile to strengthen the constraints of the constants of hypothetical long - range interactions by a factor of 1000 and more for a wide interaction range .",
    "moreover , it it is also possible to widen ( by one and a half orders of magnitude ) the boundary of the @xmath0-interval for which the casimir effect gives good constraints for yukawa - type hypothetical interactions . in this way",
    "the casimir effect becomes a strong competitor to the cavendish - type experiments in obtaining constraints for such interactions .    to obtain even stronger constraints from the casimir effect it would be desirable to enlarge the distance interval over which the force is measured , perhaps up to @xmath101 . near the left boundary of this interval",
    ", one must take into account the contributions to the casimir force resulting from the uneveness and imperfections of the disc and the lens @xcite .",
    "near the right boundary , the contributions due to the temperature corrections @xcite should be considered too .",
    "also , the use of materials with high density for the whole disc and lens would be helpful .",
    "finally , a further reduction of the error in the force measurement would be important .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted to s.k .",
