    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles has been highly successful in describing observed and measured phenomena .",
    "it contains , however , an unexplored sector , namely , the higgs sector .",
    "the sm also has several problems , one of which is the quark mass hierarchy problem , especially the top quark having a much larger mass than all other quarks .    in its minimal form",
    "the sm higgs sector is comprised of one higgs doublet , but that is not necessarily the case .",
    "non minimal extensions of the higgs sector can describe the same observed phenomena , and predict additional phenomena , which are as yet unobserved , but not ruled out .",
    "this work will describe one such extension of the sm  the two - higgs doublet model `` for the top '' ( t2hdm ) .",
    "the t2hdm features particular yukawa couplings whereby the top quark receives a special status .",
    "this particular yukawa structure also gives rise to potentially large flavor - changing ( fc ) couplings in the up - quark sector .",
    "in this work we will explicitly ( and independently ) derive the yukawa potential of the model , though it has been shown elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the fc rare decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a very low branching ratio ( br ) in the sm , of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this low br makes these decays extremely sensitive to new physics in the scalar sector . in this work",
    "we will explore the br of the fc rare decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the parameter space of the t2hdm , at the 1-loop level ( we adhere in this work to the thooft feynman gauge ) and at the tree - level order .",
    "we will focus on regions of the parameter space in which the @xmath5 can exceed the detection limit of the upcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and also on regions where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be enhanced significantly compared to other two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm is the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "a comprehensive review of the principles of the 2hdm can be found in @xcite .",
    "basically , the model is comprised of two higgs doublets , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they usually obey discrete symmetries , whose aim is to define the yukawa terms , and which divide them into several types .",
    "the 3 most common types are : type i , where @xmath11 couples to all quarks , and @xmath10 does not couple to quarks ; type ii , where @xmath10 couples to down quarks , and @xmath11 couples to up quarks ; type iii , which denotes a general case in which both @xmath10 and @xmath11 couple to all quarks .",
    "the type ii 2hdm describes the yukawa structure of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and is therefore of particular interest in the literature .",
    "several properties are common to all types of 2hdm .",
    "all feature additional physical scalars : initially there are two complex doublets , hence 8 @xmath12 degrees of freedom , and the electroweak breaking absorbs 3 .",
    "we are therefore left with 5 degrees of freedom which are equivalent to 5 physical scalars , plus the 3 ( unphysical ) goldstone bosons which are present also in the minimal sm , and which are `` eaten '' by the gauge bosons .",
    "the components of the scalar doublets mix to produce the mass eigenstates .",
    "they are denoted as follows : @xmath13  cp - even neutral scalars , @xmath14  cp - odd neutral scalar , @xmath15  neutral ( unphysical ) goldstone boson , @xmath16  charged scalars , @xmath17  charged ( unphysical ) goldstone bosons .",
    "the mixing conserves the symmetries of the theory : the mass matrix does not mix scalars with different charges , and in cp conserving theories there is no mixing between cp - even and cp - odd scalars .      the 2hdm  \" for the top  \" ( t2hdm ) was first introduced by das and kao @xcite as an effective approach for providing the top its mass in a natural way .",
    "they proposed a 2hdm in which the second higgs field couples only to the top , while the first higgs field couples to all other quarks .",
    "the choice of the coupling can be expressed also in terms of a discrete symmetry imposed on the lagrangian @xcite , under which the fields transform as follows :    @xmath18    where : @xmath19 are the higgs fields , @xmath20 are the right - handed @xmath21 singlet up - type quarks , @xmath22 are the down - type right - handed quarks , and @xmath23 is the left - handed @xmath21 quark doublet .",
    "the discrete symmetry produces the yukawa couplings of the t2hdm , described below .",
    "this discrete symmetry is softly broken by the @xmath24 term of as discussed in @xcite .    with these yukawa couplings",
    ", the top gets its mass primarily from the second higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which we will choose to be much larger than the first higgs vev : @xmath25 _ this is the working assumption of the t2hdm . _    this particular yukawa coupling can also give rise to large fc interactions , as we shall later show .",
    "distinct features of the t2hdm are :    * the @xmath26 vertex is enhanced by the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath27 compared to other 2hdm s .",
    "this property motivated our work , as well as the analysis in @xcite .",
    "* there are tree - level fc interactions in the up - quark sector ; but there are no tree - level fc interactions in the down - quark sector , unlike the case of the 2hdm - iii in which the tree - level fc interactions are both in the up and down - quark sectors . * the couplings of the neutral scalars ( @xmath28 ) to all the quarks except for the top quark , increase with @xmath29 .",
    "this property motivated the analysis in @xcite .",
    "these points will be further elaborated upon in sec .",
    "[ sec : fc sector t2hdm ] .",
    "the t2hdm could stand on its own , although the couplings and symmetries defined above do not seem `` naturally derived '' .",
    "however , it could also be viewed as an effective low energy realization of a more fundamental theory .",
    "some examples are :    * an extra - dimensions scenario , randall - sundrum like , in which the couplings are derived from the location of fields in the 5th dimension @xcite . * a technicolor scenario with a topcolor condensate scalar having a large vev , which by construction couples only to the top quark @xcite . * a non - minimal supersymmetry scenario , in which @xmath10 couples to down quarks and @xmath11 to up quarks , but the couplings for @xmath30 , @xmath31 are very small , and get most of their value from loop corrections .",
    "rare decays are a sensitive probe for new physics @xcite .",
    "such decays are defined as rare because in the sm they are subject to a suppression mechanism , which can be either highly effective cancellations , such as the gim mechanism , or the conservation of a fundamental symmetry , such as lepton number .",
    "new physics models may greatly enhance such processes , by working around the suppression mechanism .",
    "for example ,",
    "the process @xmath32 which is forbidden by lepton flavor conservation , can be realized by relaxing the symmetry in the neutrino sector ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work , we have chosen to explore the br of the rare decays @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the t2hdm , as a potential new - physics signal at the lhc .",
    "the lhc discovery limit for the @xmath3 decay process is @xmath33 @xcite for an integrated luminosity of @xmath34 . as mentioned before , the sm br is about @xmath9 , and , therefore , unobservable at the lhc .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the @xmath5 , where @xmath35 , could reach up to @xmath8 in the 2hdm type ii and in the mssm , and about @xmath36 in the 2hdm type i.    in the t2hdm the fc decays can be enhanced due to the large @xmath37 coupling which is proportional to @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 in other 2hdm s , as we shall later show .",
    "this large coupling motivated us in calculating the br of @xmath3 .",
    "as an aside , we will briefly recall how the experimental detection of the process will proceed at the lhc @xcite . at the lhc",
    "the top will be mainly produced in @xmath40 pairs .",
    "one then searches for processes in which the @xmath41 decays to @xmath42 , while the @xmath43 decays in the main @xmath44channel .",
    "the @xmath45 is most likely to decay into @xmath46 pairs when its mass is below 130 gev , whereas above this mass the @xmath47 decay channel starts to dominate @xcite .",
    "the full process ( in the lower mass range ) will look like : @xmath48 .",
    "the main background will come from a similar process in which the @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 denotes a quark jet ) , and the @xmath43 decays as before . in this case",
    "a misidentification of the jet as @xmath51 will result in an erroneous @xmath3 identification @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 decay is the complementary process to @xmath3 if @xmath52 .",
    "the amplitude of the process is equal to the amplitude of @xmath3 , by applying crossing symmetry @xcite , and therefore it is subject to the same enhancements as the @xmath3 process , compared with other 2hdm s and the sm .",
    "to date several rare decays and other observables have been calculated in the t2hdm :    * the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron was calculated in the t2hdm @xcite , and the neutron edm in @xcite , for their dependence on the cp violating mixing in the higgs sector .",
    "the experimental results constrain this mixing . *",
    "the process @xmath53 was calculated in the t2hdm in the leading order , for its contribution to @xmath54 @xcite . by adding this result to the sm prediction",
    "one can compare the theory to the experimental result : @xmath55 @xcite , and derive bounds on the model .",
    "a prediction was also given for the partial rate asymmetry of the decay , which is very different from the sm prediction , and can be measured in b factories .",
    "newer measurements in @xcite seem to further restrict the additional cp violating phase in the yukawa sector of the t2hdm ( see below ) . * the meson mixings",
    "@xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 @xcite were calculated for contributions to the mass splittings @xmath59 , @xmath60 of @xmath57 mixing , the ratio p / q of @xmath58 mixing .",
    "these results further constrain the parameter space of the t2hdm , in a manner similar to @xmath53 , as was discussed above , ruling out different regions of the parameter space @xcite . *",
    "the process @xmath61 was calculated in @xcite , and was found to constrain the t2hdm weakly , so that those bounds are included within other calculated bounds . *",
    "the process @xmath62 was considered in @xcite , where @xmath63 denotes a @xmath64 or @xmath65 quark .",
    "it was found that the t2hdm cross section for this process will be detectable at the lhc , while the mssm and the 2hdm type ii are not expected to have a detectable signal .",
    "therefore if such a signal is observed at the lhc then it will stand out as a clear indication in favor of the t2hdm . *",
    "the process @xmath66 was calculated in various models @xcite .",
    "experimentally the br has a weak upper bound .",
    "it was found that the t2hdm br for this decay is comparable in size to the sm predicted value ( @xmath67 ) , and to the mssm with @xmath68 mixing . in comparison ,",
    "mssm with @xmath69 mixing is about two orders of magnitude higher , while the 2hdm type ii is about two orders of magnitude lower . * in a recent article @xcite some of the above calculations were simultaneously combined for a fit to recent experimental data , mostly from b - factories .",
    "the best - fit values and @xmath70 intervals for all the parameters in the fit were calculated . as this is the most comprehensive work constraining the t2hdm parameters , these were the bounds used in the present work .",
    "the rare decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 have not been calculated yet in the t2hdm .",
    "this work is aimed at this calculation , with the intention of giving a prediction which will hopefully be verifiable at the lhc .",
    "in this section we give an explicit derivation of the feynman rules of scalar - quark - quark interactions in the t2hdm .",
    "we will start from the interaction - basis lagrangian , which follows from the symmetries imposed .",
