    "+ there are many different types of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex , each with different patterns of input and output . for example , the basket cells project almost exclusively onto the somas and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons .",
    "in addition to their function in suppressing cortical activity , inhibitory cells may also be responsible for shaping the temporal pattern of spiking activity in the cortical network .",
    "in particular , the synapses from baskets cells near the spike initiating zone are effective in gating the occurrence of spikes @xcite , and since a single basket cell has multiple inhibitory contacts on several thousand pyramidal cells , it could synchronize a subset of active cortical neurons .",
    "+ local cortical interneurons are not isolated from each other but form networks connected by fast gabaergic inhibitory synapses and electrical gap junctions @xcite . networks of inhibitory interneurons have been implicated in the generation of synchronous gamma - frequency - range oscillations in the hippocampus @xcite and the cortex @xcite , and could entrain a large number of principal cells @xcite as well as modulate their firing rates @xcite .",
    "hence , interneuron networks could mediate the effects of attention observed in cortical neurons .",

    "the focus of this study is on the impact of synchronous inhibitory input onto the principal output neurons of the cortex .",
    "+ the degree of synchrony of inhibitory inputs can be characterized by their temporal dispersion , referred to here as jitter",
    ". a lower value of jitter corresponds to more synchrony and means that inhibitory inputs tend to arrive at the same time .",
    "we explore how the response of the output neuron  the firing rate and coherence with inhibitory oscillation  is modulated by jitter .",
    "our main results are : ( 1 ) the mean number of inhibitory inputs determines whether variations in synchrony lead to changes in the neuron s sensitivity or whether they modulate the gain of the response ( section 3.2 , 3.3 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the response modulation by synchrony is most potent at gamma frequencies ( section 3.4 ) .",

    "the time - average of the inhibitory conductance was @xmath65 , which was about four times larger than the leak conductance @xmath66 .",
    "the neuron was not spontaneously active in the absence of synaptic inputs ; hence , in order to make it spike in the presence of inhibition , a constant depolarizing current @xmath67 was also injected .",
    "the temporal dispersion of the input spike times was on average @xmath16 . in the baseline state , @xmath68 ,",

    "the spike train looked quite regular during the period with high input synchrony because it was entrained to the input oscillation .",
    "although the interspike intervals were variable they were approximate multiples of the oscillation period .",
    "hence , the high cv value was a consequence of the multimodality of the interspike interval distribution .",
    "+ the irregularity of spike trains across trials is commonly expressed as the fano factor ( ff ) : the variance of the spike counts during a time interval divided by the mean . for a @xmath73 interval , ff@xmath83 ( baseline ) and ff@xmath84 ( increased input synchrony ) . in comparison ,",
    "a homogeneous poisson process has cv@xmath85 and ff@xmath85 .",
    "the value of the fano factor is a direct consequence of our choice of model parameters : there is variability across trials in the arrival time of the inhibitory volley , @xmath13 , variability in the number and the timing of the inputs in the volley , and intrinsic noise .",
    "consistent with this expectation , much smaller fano factors were obtained when one or more of these sources of variability were absent .",
    "+ the spike - field coherence ( sfc ) has been used to quantify the degree of coherence of spike trains with the local field potential ( lfp ) .",
    "the lfp is measured using an extracellular electrode and is assumed to reflect the synaptic inputs to neurons close to the electrode and their resulting activity @xcite . it is not known in general how many neurons contribute to the lfp and whether it is dominated by the activity of local neurons or whether it more closely reflects the synaptic activity due to presynaptic neurons .",
    "we calculated the lfp as the membrane potential fluctuations in a neuron that was hyperpolarized to prevent action potentials .",
    "the sfc in the gamma frequency range ( 34 - 44 hz ) decreased from @xmath86 in the baseline state to @xmath87 during the period of increased inhibitory input synchrony .",
    "this counterintuitive result underscores the fact that in modeling studies the sfc so defined may not be the best way of calculating the coherence ; hence , the vector strength ( vs ) will be used here instead , although for comparison with experiments in section 3.5 the sfc will be used",
    ". the relation between the sfc and the vs is explained in the appendix . during the state of increased inhibitory input synchrony ,",
    "the vs increased to @xmath88 from @xmath89 in the baseline state .",
    "the key constraint is that one needs enough spikes to accurately estimate the sfc .",
    "the sfc for the baseline state was recalculated , but with the injected current increased from @xmath90 to @xmath91 in order to make the neuron s firing rate similar to that for synchronous inputs .",
    "the sfc was @xmath92 in the gamma range and @xmath93 in the theta range .",
    "+ fig.@xmath22[examplespiketrain ] shows another example of firing rate modulation with input synchrony .",
    "the model neuron was again driven by a synchronous inhibitory drive , but part of the depolarization was provided by a homogeneous excitatory poisson process . during the time interval between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ms , @xmath16 was decreased from @xmath96 ms to @xmath97 ms .",
    "for @xmath98 ms , the firing rate was @xmath99 hz and @xmath100 ( other statistics are listed in table 1 ) .",
    "when the input synchrony was increased the firing rate increased to @xmath101hz and @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast to fig.@xmath22[examplespiketrainregular ] , the spike trains looked more like the ones found _ in vivo_. the degree of synchrony also modulated the firing rate at higher values ( fig.@xmath22[examplespiketrain ] ) , rather than just acting as a gate ( fig.@xmath22[examplespiketrainregular ] ) .",
    "+ in both examples the model predicts that synchrony - induced increases in firing rate are associated with a decrease in firing variability and an increase in coherence .",
    "the firing rate was plotted as a function of the depolarizing current @xmath0 and the jitter @xmath16 in ( fig.@xmath22[firsurf1]a ) .",
    "the firing rate ranged from @xmath45 to @xmath103hz for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "an increase in @xmath16 usually led to a reduction in firing rate ( dashed arrow in fig.@xmath22[firsurf1]a ) .",
    "the @xmath1 curve for constant @xmath16 had a knee for small values of @xmath16 ( arrow in fig.@xmath22[firsurf1]a ) .",
    "at this point in the neuron s operating range , decreasing @xmath16 ( increasing input synchrony ) did not lead to an increase in firing rate , but the coherence did increase ( see below ) .",
    "neither did an increase in driving current result in a higher firing rate .",
    "because of the stochastic nature of the dynamics the firing rate could be arbitrarily low . for practical purposes the onset of firing",
    "was defined as the point where the firing rate exceeded @xmath106 .",
    "this means that on average more than one spike should be observed on @xmath20  s long trials .",
    "the current value at which this happened increased steadily with increasing @xmath16 ( fig.@xmath22[firsurf1]a ) .",
    "+ to determine how the variability and the coherence were related to the firing rate @xmath47 , cv - f and vs - f plots were made at constant @xmath16 values ( fig.@xmath22[firsurf1]b , c ) .",

    "the relationship between the knee in the @xmath47-@xmath0 curve and the dip in the @xmath111-@xmath47 curve can be understood in terms of phase locking to the synchronous inhibitory synaptic drive .",
    "when the neuron is phase - locked it fires one spike on each cycle and the firing rate is 40 hz . the interspike interval is approximately equal to duration of an oscillation cycle , but there is some variability due to jitter of the spike time within each cycle .",
    "the @xmath111 is small for this situation . for smaller driving currents ,",
    "the phase locking becomes less stable and the firing rate falls below 40hz .",
    "the neuron will then skip cycles leading to a bimodal distribution of interspike intervals : the intervals are either approximately equal to one cycle or two cycles . as a result",

    "a more detailed description of phase locking to a periodic inhibitory drive can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ the most regular spike trains were obtained near the knee in the firing rate surface .",

    "for @xmath112 , there was a precipitous drop in vs with firing rate .",
    "this occurred because for @xmath113 the neuron produced at most one spike per cycle at approximately the same phase with respect to the oscillation  hence the vs was high , but for @xmath112 , there could be two spikes on a given cycle , at two different phases , and hence the vs was lower .",

    "there were quantitative differences : the increase in sfc with attention was of the order of 10% in experiment , whereas in the model it was an order of magnitude larger .",
    "these differences could possibly be resolved by a more detailed model that incorporates the electrical behavior of the extracellular medium in order to estimate the lfp more accurately .",

    "+ the firing rate increased when input synchrony was increased by reducing @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath16 was modulated dynamically , the change in firing rate was immediate and robust across trials .",
    "this implies that temporal dynamics of firing rate modulation is determined by how fast a presynaptic network can be activated , and how fast network activation results in an increase in synchrony .",
    "interneuron networks can modulate their synchrony in a few oscillation cycles  on the order of @xmath169 for gamma - frequency range activity @xcite  and the firing rate response is able to follow these rapid synchrony modulations .",
    "rapid modulation of the firing rate observed in the cortex can therefore be due to the temporal dynamics of the stimulus as well as synchrony .",
    "in addition to serving as a way to amplify the significance of information represented in a neural population , inhibitory synchrony provides an alternative pathway for cortical information transmission that can operate in parallel with changes in activity .",
    "our investigation also revealed that other statistical properties of the input , besides @xmath16 , such as the oscillation frequency and @xmath13 , could also dynamically modulate the output firing rate ( data not shown ) .",
    "+ the @xmath1 curves were characterized in terms of sensitivity , the weakest inputs to which the neuron will respond , and the gain , the rate of change of the firing rate with input amplitude . by increasing input synchrony ,",
    "the neuron responded to weaker stimuli , and its gain increased so that the same increase in stimulus strength would result in a stronger increase of the firing rate .",
    "the relative size of the shift in sensitivity compared with the change in gain depended on @xmath9 . for small @xmath170 , the change in gain dominated , whereas for larger @xmath171 , the shift in sensitivity dominated . in the latter case ,",
    "saturation was observed : when the firing rate was approximately equal to the oscillation frequency , it did not increase further when either the input was made stronger or when the input synchrony was increased .",
    "it should be noted that the unitary strength of the inhibitory inputs was normalized such that the mean ( time- averaged ) inhibitory conductance remained constant when @xmath9 was varied .",
    "this allowed us to distinguish the effects of an increase in mean inhibitory conductance with @xmath9 from the effects of the reduced variability in the input with @xmath9 .",
    "+ we measured the vector strength ( vs ) of the output spike train with respect to the oscillatory activity of the inhibitory input .",
    "changes in the vs reflected the behavior of the sfc in the gamma - frequency range , but vs was easier to calculate and more robust than the sfc .",
    "the vs increased with input synchrony and it even did so when the firing rate remained the same .",

    "we found non - monotonic behavior of ff and cv as a function of the firing rate for @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , the ff was sensitive to the jitter across trials in the phase of the oscillation at the start of the trial ( or stimulus onset ) , whereas the cv was not sensitive to this phase .",

    "although the synchronization dynamics of inhibitory networks has been studied extensively using model simulations @xcite , the focus has almost exclusively been on the stationary state , rather than dynamic changes in synchrony .",
    "we found two types of networks whose synchrony can be changed by neuromodulators or excitatory neurotransmitters @xcite .",
    "these results will be presented elsewhere ; we summarize them here briefly .",
    "first , in a purely inhibitory network , synchrony can be modulated by increasing excitation to a part of the network .",
    "the activated neurons increase their firing rate and synchronize and reduce the activity of the other group of interneurons @xcite .",
    "hence , the mean activity of the network that projects to a postsynaptic neuron , like the one studied here , remains approximately constant .",
    "synchrony can be modulated using this mechanism on time scales as short as @xmath169 .",
    "second , in a mixed excitatory and inhibitory network , synchrony can be modulated by activating the interneuron network when the inhibitory and excitatory neurons are mode - locked to each other . in that case @xcite , synchronized excitatory activity recruits inhibitory activity that temporarily shuts down the excitatory activity .",
    "when the inhibition decays the excitatory neurons become active again and the cycle starts over .",
    "activation of interneuron networks by neuromodulators may increase their synchrony , in turn increasing excitatory synchrony , but without altering the mean firing rate of individual neurons @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the synaptic inputs determine the sensitivity and gain of the @xmath1 curve .",
    "three mechanisms have been proposed for how multiplicative gain changes can be achieved @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize them and discuss how they relate to gain modulation by inhibitory synchrony .",
    "+ the response properties of neurons are different when they are driven by a supra- or infra - threshold currents @xcite . in the former case neurons are tonically active and fluctuations in the input will not alter the firing rate , whereas in the latter case action potentials are induced by fluctuations ( referred to as a fluctuation - dominated state @xcite ) .",
    "the firing rates for neurons in the fluctuation - dominated state can be increased by either reducing the distance of the mean membrane potential to threshold , or by increasing the amplitude of the voltage fluctuations .",
    "for each of the mechanisms discussed below the neuron operates in the fluctuation regime , but the way that fluctuations increase or decrease the distance to threshold is different .",
    "+ under _ in vivo _",
    "conditions neurons receive a constant barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs @xcite .",
    "the synaptic inputs are called balanced when the effective reversal potential of the sum of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is equal to the neuron s resting membrane potential ( leak reversal potential ) . by proportionally scaling the rates of excitatory and inhibitory inputs the amplitude of the voltage fluctuations",
    "can be modulated while maintaining a constant mean membrane potential . in the balanced mode",
    "the neuron is driven by fluctuations : the larger the fluctuations , the higher the firing rate . chance and coworkers @xcite found multiplicative gain modulation of the @xmath1 curves of neurons recorded in vitro experiments .",
    "interestingly , an increase in balanced activity decreased the gain @xcite .",
    "the reason for this somewhat counterintuitive result is that the increase in input conductance dominates the increase in conductance variance , resulting in an amplitude reduction of voltage fluctuations .",
    "the saturation of dendritic nonlinearities can further enhance the change in gain obtained with balanced inputs @xcite . in a modeling study in which the excitatory and inhibitory fluctuations were independently varied ,",
    "varying the amplitude of the inhibitory conductances was more effective than varying the amplitude of the excitatory conductances @xcite .",
    "+ tonic inhibition by itself did not lead to multiplicative gain modulation @xcite .",
    "however , when tonic inhibition was applied in combination with either excitatory or inhibitory poisson spike train inputs , changes in gain as well as shifts in sensitivity were observed @xcite . recently",
    "murphy and miller @xcite showed that changes in tonic excitation and inhibition can lead to approximate multiplicative gain modulation of cortical responses when the nonlinearity of the thalamic contrast response is taken into account .",
    "+ when a neuron is in a fluctuation - dominated state and receives inputs from different neurons , it is sensitive to correlations between these neurons .",
    "stronger correlations lead to an increase in the amplitude of voltage fluctuations , hence to an increase in firing rate @xcite , because the mean input conductance is not altered by correlations , as was the case for balanced synaptic inputs . + changing input synchrony for small @xmath9 value resulted in a gain change of the @xmath1 curve .",
    "this mechanism is complementary to gain modulation by correlation .",
    "there are two different aspects of synchrony , the degree of coincidence  how many neurons fire at approximately the same time , @xmath9 , and the precision  the temporal dispersion of the neurons that fire together , @xmath16 .",
    "the number of neurons @xmath9 roughly corresponds to the degree of correlation .",
    "changing @xmath16 resulted both in a change of the distance to threshold as well as the amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "however , the ` threshold ' here is a conductance threshold : the neuron spiked when the inhibitory conductance became smaller than a threshold value .",
    "the mean minimum inhibitory conductance distance from the threshold and the fluctuations about this value determined the firing rate change .",
    "we are not aware of any mechanisms that have been proposed to selectively change the level of balanced input or degree of correlations in the network .",
    "in contrast , mechanisms have been proposed to modulate the input synchrony of the network , the parameter @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "+      more than a decade ago crick and koch proposed a link between oscillatory synchrony and attentional processing @xcite .",
    "this led to a model in which excitatory neurons representing stimuli in the focus of attention produced correlated spike trains @xcite . in their model , interneurons in cortical area v4",
    "were activated by correlated spike trains and in turn suppressed v4 neurons responsive to stimuli outside the focus of attention ; hence , the synchronized interneurons suppressed rather than enhanced activity . in the mechanism",
    "explored here , interneurons are active irrespective of the attentional state , and their degree of synchrony modulates the responsiveness of v4 output neurons .",
    "the time - course of attentional modulation of neural responses was also studied by deco and coworkers @xcite but the synchrony of interneuron networks was not taken into account .",
    "+ under the assumption that attention acts by increasing the synchrony of interneuron networks , our model predicts that : ( 1 ) attention increases the coherence of spike trains with the local field potential ; ( 2 ) the firing rate can increase with attention or remain the same depending on the stimulus strength ; ( 3 ) attention can lead to a multiplicative gain change of firing rate response curves or to a shift in the sensitivity , depending on the extent of interneuron network activation by attention and the stimulus .",
    "thus , changes in interneuron synchrony could potentially underlie a variety of seemingly unrelated observations .",
    "the size of the firing rate modulation predicted by this model agrees quantitatively with experimental observations ( section 3.5 and appendix ) .",
    "however , these results do not provide direct evidence that modulation of inhibitory synchrony is , in fact , responsible for the observed attentional effects . in the following we discuss specific predictions that derive from this hypothesis . + mcadams & maunsell @xcite observed multiplicative gain modulation of the orientation tuning curves of v4 neurons .",
    "we could reproduce these results quantitatively by changing @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 corresponding to the attended and non - attended state were not unique and we could obtain the same results with different combinations .",

    "we could not fit our @xmath1 curves with a power - law and changing @xmath16 both changed the gain and shifted the sensitivity  the gain change was not purely multiplicative .",
    "we could account for the results by mcadams & maunsell because the firing rate in response to a non - preferred stimulus ",
    "the so - called asymptote  was modulated by attention even though the background activity  the firing rate without stimulus  was not affected .",
    "only the modulation of the firing rate tuning curve above this asymptote was multiplicative .",
    "hence , both a shift in sensitivity and a change in gain were required .",
    "the change in gain in the model only needed to be multiplicative over a limited range of the input current @xmath0 . + recent experiments were performed to determine whether attention would modulate the gain of the firing rate response , or whether the response properties could be interpreted as a shift in sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the firing rate elicited in response to a visual stimulus was measured as a function of stimulus contrast .",
    "the firing rate versus contrast had a sigmoidal shape and saturated .",
    "gain modulation would imply that the saturation rate was increased by attention .",
    "this was not observed in the experiments and the changes were more consistent with a shift in sensitivity .",
    "hence , depending on the specifics of the experimental protocol , attention can either increase sensitivity @xcite or gain @xcite .",
    "our model predicts that this behavior is correlated with the connectivity and degree of activation of the interneuron network .",
    "+ mcadams & maunsell also reported that the attentional modulation of the firing rate reached its stationary value @xmath173 after the onset of the response to the stimulus ( appendix ) .",
    "we could reproduce this by assuming that the @xmath16 value changed gradually from its background value ( here equal to the @xmath16 in the non - attended state ) to its value in the attended state .",
    "there was no change in @xmath16 if there was no stimulus .",
    "the model used here does not make predictions about the temporal dynamics of @xmath16 since that is a network property .",

    ". it can be due to the activation of intrinsic currents or increases in input conductance associated with synaptic background activity .",
    "these saturation effects would , however , in general not cause the reduction of response variability predicted by our model . in those experiments where attention did modulate the firing rate response , no concomitant reduction of response variability",

    "this result was explained by a simple model proposed by reynolds _ et al _ @xcite .",

    "<S> recordings from area v4 of monkeys have revealed that when the focus of attention is on a visual stimulus within the receptive field of a cortical neuron , two distinct changes can occur : the firing rate of the neuron can change and there can be an increase in the coherence between spikes and the local field potential ( lfp ) in the gamma - frequency range ( 30 - 50 hz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis explored here is that these observed effects of attention could be a consequence of changes in the synchrony of local interneuron networks . </S>",

    "<S> we observed that the neuron s firing rate and the coherence of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated by the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs . when inhibitory synchrony increased , the coherence of spiking model neurons with the synaptic input increased , but the firing rate either increased or remained the same . </S>",
