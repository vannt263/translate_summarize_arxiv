    "electric polarization is a key quantity for computing and understanding technologically - relevant effective charges , dielectric and piezoelectric responses that are the derivatives of polarization with respect to atomic displacement , electric field , and strain , respectively.@xcite polarization also plays an important role in the methodology development of the theory dealing with finite electric fields in infinite solids , by minimization of the free energy @xmath4",
    "total electric polarization consists of electronic contribution ( @xmath5 ) and ionic component ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "computing the latter component is straightforward using point charges , while calculating the electronic polarization is not .",
    "today @xmath5 is calculated using the sophisticated modern theory of polarization@xcite . according to the theory",
    ", @xmath5 corresponds to a geometrical phase of the valence electron states , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the berry phase of occupied bloch wave functions @xmath9 .",
    "subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 mean parallel and perpendicular to the polarization direction , respectively .",
    "practically , to carry out the @xmath5 calculations , the integral in eq.([epel ] ) is replaced by a weighted summation of the phases at sampled discrete @xmath12-points ( monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite , for example ) in the 2d @xmath2 plane , namely , @xmath13 with weight @xmath14 .",
    "the polarization at individual @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is calculated as the phase of the determinant formed by valence states at two neighboring @xmath12s on the @xmath15 string as @xcite @xmath16 defined as such , the total polarization @xmath17 could be uniquely determined and gauge independent up to a modula constant . in eq.([epel ] ) one sees that , it is the @xmath3 phases at different @xmath2 that determine the electronic polarization .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the properties of @xmath3 .",
    "the physical significance of the @xmath3 quantity can be understood by analogy .",
    "it is well known that band structure , which describes the relation between single - particle orbital energy and electron wave vector @xmath12 , is very useful for understanding electronic , photo - excitation , and photoemission properties in solids@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 relation may be similarly termed as `` polarization structure '' , or `` polarization - phase structure '' .",
    "electron states in band structure can be changed by photo - excitation or emission .",
    "the @xmath2-point polarization phase can be altered by electric fields , which act as a possible excitation source for electrical polarization .",
    "note that electrical fields do not alter the electron wave vector ( @xmath2 ) perpendicular to the direction of the field , and thus @xmath2 remains a conserved quantity .",
    "the field - induced variation of @xmath3 in fact manifests the @xmath2-dependent polarization current . as a result , the relevance of polarization structure to electronic polarization is like the band structure to electronic properties .",
    "furthermore , understanding the @xmath3 quantity is of useful value from both fundamental and computational points of view .",
    "fundamentally , this quantity is determined by the bloch wave functions , not in the ordinary sense of spatial distribution , but through the interesting aspects of the berry s phase of occupied manifold of electron states . studying how @xmath3 depends on @xmath2",
    "may yield better understanding of electron states , as well as the rather intriguing connection between these states and their contributions to polarization in insulator solids .",
    "computationally , we first recognize that the @xmath3 phase computed from eq.([ephi_2 ] ) always produces a value within the principal range @xmath18 $ ] . in reality , depending on the dispersion of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 , it is possible that the phases for different @xmath12 points fall in different branches . in other words , the true @xmath3 values may fall in the principal range for some @xmath2 points ( let us denote this set of @xmath2 points as @xmath19 ) , while falling out of the principal range for other @xmath2 ( to be denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "we find numerically that this indeed happens for real materials particularly when polarization is large ; a specific example is given in section ii .",
    "when this occurs , one must _ not _ artificially shift the phases of the @xmath21 into the principal range , as computers do according to eq.([ephi_2 ] ) .",
    "though this shift makes no difference to the polarization phase of individual @xmath2 points , it will alter the total @xmath5 polarization , yielding spurious magnitude of polarization .",
    "only when the phase of _ every _ @xmath2 is shifted by a constant @xmath22 will the total @xmath5 polarization remain equivalent . to find out which @xmath2 may generate a phase not in the principal range , one in principle should compute the whole dispersion structure of polarization and then map out the @xmath3 for all @xmath2 points based on the assumption that the @xmath3 phase is a continuous function of wave vector @xmath2 , which makes it important to study the properties of the @xmath3 phase as a function of @xmath2 .    despite the relevance ,",
    "the dispersion structure of polarization is nevertheless not completely understood .",
    "more specifically , ( 1 ) little is known about what determine the @xmath3 phase at individual @xmath2 . in eq.([ephi_2 ] ) , @xmath3 is determined by the wave functions of a string of @xmath15 points , not just a single @xmath12 . as a result , the answer to the question is highly non - trivial .",
    "( 2 ) for a given ferroelectric substance ( say , the prototypical pbtio@xmath1 ) , it is not clear which @xmath2 exhibits the largest polarization contribution .",
    "does the @xmath23 point always contribute most or least ? ( 3 ) we do not know if the berry s phases at different @xmath2s share a similar value or are very different from each other , that is , a problem concerning the dispersion width of the polarization structure .",
    "slightly more intriguing , one may wonder along which direction the @xmath24 curve shows the largest dispersion ?",
    "( 4 ) even for two commonly studied ferroelectrics , batio@xmath1 and pbtio@xmath1 , we do not know how different or similar their polarization structures are .",
    "recently , there is another active field in the study of polarization , which concerns the use of inplane strain to tune the ferroelectric polarization @xcite .",
    "this tunability stems from the fundamental interest in the strain - polarization coupling .",
    "imposed under inplane strain ferroelectrics subject to modifications of chemical bonds and/or charge transfer , thereby the interaction between atoms is altered .",
    "it has been known that a compressive inplane strain tends to enhance the total polarization .",
    "but the amplitude of enhancement was found to be highly material dependent.@xcite considering the importance of the strain effects , one might want to know how the @xmath3 phase from each @xmath2 can be influenced by strain .",
    "strain effects on the polarization dispersion remain largely unknown , however .",
    "it would be of interest to examine how the strain may tune and modify the dispersion of polarization structure .",
    "specific questions on this aspect are : in what manner would the inplane strain change the relative contributions and curvatures at different @xmath2 , and how the band width of the dispersion curve is to be altered .    with these questions in mind , we here study the dispersion structure of the polarization in ferroelectric perovskites , as well as its dependence on inplane strains .",
    "two complementary approaches ( first - principles density functional calculations and analytical formulations ) are used . by means of analytical formulation",
    ", we aim at a better understanding on what specific quantities and/or interactions determine the polarization at individual @xmath2 point .",
    "our calculations reveal some useful knowledge on the polarization structure in perovskite ferroelectrics .",
    "for example , the largest @xmath3 contribution is shown not to come from the zone center , but from the zone boundary .",
    "we also find that the polarization curve in pbtio@xmath1 is notably flat along the @xmath25 direction , and exhibits , however , a strong dispersion along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "our theoretical analysis further reveals that the flat dispersion along the @xmath25 direction is caused by a small amount of participation from the nearest - neighbor interaction between the wannier functions .",
    "finally , the present study also demonstrates some rather interesting differences in pbtio@xmath1 and batio@xmath1 , in terms of the polarization structures as well as their strain dependences .",
    "we first present the density functional calculations on the polarization structure in pbtio@xmath1 . in its ferroelectric phase pbtio@xmath1",
    "is tetragonal ( @xmath27 ) and possesses a large spontaneous polarization .",
    "the polarization is along the @xmath28-axis direction , perpendicular to the @xmath2 plane .",
    "calculations are performed within the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite .",
    "we use pseudopotential method with mixed basis set@xcite .",
    "the troullier - martins type of pseudopotentials are employed  @xcite .",
    "details for generating pseudopotentials , including atomic configurations , pseudo / all - electron matching radii , and accuracy checking , were described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the energy cutoff is 100 ryd , which is sufficient for convergence .",
    "the calculations are performed in two steps : the optimized cell structure and atomic positions are first determined by minimizing the total energy and hellmann - feynman forces , and after the structural optimization , the polarization dispersion of @xmath3 is calculated using the modern theory of polarization.@xcite our lda - calculated inplane lattice constant for unstrained pt is @xmath29=3.88 , with @xmath30 , both agreeing well with other existing calculations .    figure [ fpt](a )",
    "shows the reduced 2d brillouin zone that the @xmath2 points sample over .",
    "the calculated @xmath31 phases at individual @xmath2 points along the @xmath32 path are given in fig.[fpt](b ) .",
    "reciprocal - space coordinates of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the dispersion curve is rigidly shifted such that the phase at @xmath37 is taken as the zero reference .    before we discuss the specific results in fig.[fpt ] , we need to point out that the shape of this @xmath2-dependent phase curve is translation invariant . as is known",
    ", the electronic polarization alone can be an arbitrary value , if the solid is uniformly translated with respect to a fixed origin of coordinates .",
    "though different translations will change the absolute location of the polarization - dispersion curve , the shape of the curve remains unaffected , however .",
    "this can be easily illustrated by analyzing the change in the @xmath3 phase when one displaces the solid arbitrarily .",
    "let the wave function of the original system be @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "now , we displace the solid by an arbitrary vector @xmath40 while the origin of coordinates is fixed .",
    "let us denote the original system using script a and the displaced system using script b , so @xmath41 .",
    "the wave functions of the displaced system satisfy    @xmath42    thus we have @xmath43 . substituting this relation into eq.([ephi_1 ] ) or eq.([ephi_2 ] ) , one can obtain that the @xmath3 of the displaced system is    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the number of bands occupied by electrons .",
    "the phase differences between the a and b systems are thus a constant , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "several observations are ready in fig.[fpt](b ) : ( 1 ) the largest @xmath3 polarization does not come from the zone - center @xmath37 point .",
    "rather surprisingly , the largest @xmath3 phase is from the @xmath34 point which lies at the far end of the bz .",
    "( 2 ) the polarization curve is flat along the @xmath25 line , showing only a small dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion becomes very large along the @xmath26 direction .",
    "( 3 ) at @xmath2 points of high symmetry ( such as @xmath37 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 ) , the curve in fig.[fpt](b ) has zero slope , similar to the electron band structure .",
    "( 4 ) the dispersion of polarization also shows subtle details which could not be easily understood .",
    "for example , there is a local ( though not very pronounced ) maximum along the @xmath46 line , making the @xmath33 point a local minimum in both @xmath25 and @xmath47 directions .",
    "our calculations further reveal that , despite the fact that the polarization in fig.[fpt](b ) exhibits substantial @xmath2 dependency , the dispersion width ( @xmath480.6 ) is much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "this finding is important for the following reason .",
    "as described in the introduction , if the differences of the @xmath3 phases at different @xmath2 points are greater than @xmath22 , one would encounter a difficulty in determining which branch of phase a specific @xmath2 point should be assigned .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided only after the phases of all @xmath2 points are mapped out .",
    "fortunately , the result in fig.[fpt](b ) tells us that the phase contributions from different @xmath2 points are fairly close , and the differences are far less than the critical value of @xmath22 that may cause the above difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out that even a small polarization dispersion as in fig.[fpt](b ) may still give rise to spurious results on total polarization . to illustrate this",
    ", we displace all five atoms in pbtio@xmath1 along the polar _",
    "c_-axis by a distance @xmath49 .",
    "fig.[fzo](a ) shows the total ( electronic + ionic ) polarization , computed from the geometric phase , as a function of the displacement @xmath49 ( in unit of @xmath28 ) .",
    "intuition tells us that the total polarization should be uniquely determined and translationally invariant .",
    "however , we see in fig.[fzo](a ) that unphysical discontinuity happens for some @xmath49 points , and this discontinuity shows up periodically . to understand what causes the discontinuity",
    ", we examine the phase contributions from individual @xmath2 ( sampled according to the monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite ) , depicted in fig.[fzo](b ) .",
    "figure [ fzo](b ) shows that the individual-@xmath2 phases indeed are a periodic function of @xmath49 , explaining why the discontinuity in fig.[fzo](a ) is periodic . here",
    "it may be useful to comment briefly on the length of the periodicity .",
    "one might think that by displacing the solid by a distance of @xmath28 in the @xmath28-axis direction , the @xmath3 phase would change by a value of @xmath22 .",
    "however , the periodicity in fig.[fzo ] is much smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "the explanation is simple . as a matter of fact",
    ", in real space the individual @xmath3 has a periodicity of @xmath50 ( instead of @xmath28 ) , which for pbtio@xmath1 the periodicity is 0.0455@xmath28 because @xmath51 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the numerical calculation in pt ( fig.[fzo]b ) .",
    "the length of periodicity can be seen from eq.([ephi_ba ] ) , showing that , whenever @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is an arbitrary integer and @xmath54 is the lattice vector along the @xmath55 direction ) , the @xmath56 and @xmath57 differ by @xmath58 .",
    "fig.[fzo](b ) also reveals the reason responsible for the discontinuity of the total polarization .",
    "spurious discontinuity occurs when the @xmath3 phases of some ( but not all ) individual @xmath2 exceed @xmath22 [ fig.[fzo](b ) ] .",
    "under this situation , computers incorrectly shift the phases of these @xmath2 points back to the principle range , yielding spurious total polarization . according to our experience",
    ", spurious polarization often takes place in two circumstances : one is for materials of very large polarization , such as tetragonal bisco@xmath1 , and another is when atoms in the unit cell are translationally shifted .",
    "given the small bandwidth of the @xmath3 dispersion , it is now straightforward that , by using different @xmath59s , we can avoid the spurious polarization .",
    "however for some materials , if the dispersion width from different @xmath2 points is larger than @xmath22 , one may have to rely on the continuity of the @xmath3 phases , and map out the phases of individual @xmath2 points over the whole two - dimensional @xmath2 plane in order to find the correct phase branch .",
    "an important property of ferroelectrics is that the polarization is strongly dependent on strain .",
    "while strain can change the total polarization , response of the polarization dispersion structure to strain could also be an interesting problem .",
    "here we investigate the response of the polarization structure under inplane strain in pbtio@xmath1 . for each in - plane ( @xmath29 ) lattice",
    "constant , the out - of - plane @xmath28 lattice constant and atomic positions are fully relaxed , by minimizing the dft total energy .",
    "the polarization structure is then determined using the optimal structure .",
    "figure [ fpt_str ] shows the phase dispersion curves for pbtio@xmath1 at different inplane lattice constants .",
    "all curves are shifted so that the phase at @xmath37 point is zero , in order to conduct direct comparison .",
    "three conclusions can be drawn from fig.[fpt_str ] : ( 1 ) the relative phase , @xmath60 , changes drastically for @xmath34 , but not so significantly for @xmath33 .",
    "( 2 ) at increasing strain , ( or smaller inplane @xmath29 constant ) , the bandwidth of the dispersion initially changes very little when @xmath61 , and then starts to _ decrease _ upon further increasing strain to @xmath62 .",
    "the decline of the dispersion bandwidth is rather surprising , since a compressive inplane strain is known to enhance the total polarization in pt .",
    "the decline is also counterintuitive when one considers that the decreasing inplane lattice constant makes the atom - atom coupling stronger within the inplane directions , and should therefore have increased the bandwidth .",
    "one possible reason that may cause the decrease of the bandwidth is given in the next section . as a result of the declining dispersion ,",
    "the polarization curve becomes notably `` flat '' at small @xmath63 .",
    "( 3 ) the curvature of the dispersion also shows subtle changes , featured by the fact that a new dispersion minimum appears along the @xmath64 line at large strain . as a consequence , the dispersion curvature [ i.e. , the second derivative @xmath65 at @xmath23 point alters its sign from being positive ( at large @xmath29 ) to negative ( at small @xmath29 ) .",
    "furthermore , the local maximum between @xmath25 for unstrained pt turns into a new minimum at large inplane strains .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath33 point changes from a minimum into a saddle point , when strain increases .",
    "the calculations thus reveal that , while inplane strain has been previously known to introduce interesting modifications ( sometimes markedly enlarged @xcite and sometimes remarkably small @xcite ) to the _ total _ @xmath28-axis polarization , its effects on the polarization dispersion at individual @xmath2 points appear to be even richer , showing that the polarization structure indeed worths studying .",
    "the subtle response of the polarization structure , as predicted above , indicate that there is new and rather complex physics behind the results in fig.[fpt_str ] . while we know that the strain - induced changes in the polarization dispersion must be associated with the fundamental modification of electron wave functions , we also have to admit that the dft results obtained in our numerical calculations are puzzling , and an intuitive understanding of the results is difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , this is an early attempt to investigate the polarization structure , and there is not much previous understanding in the literature .",
    "second , although eq.([ephi_1 ] ) and eq.([ephi_2 ] ) allow us to compute precisely the polarization of individual @xmath2 , a direct and more intuitive connection between @xmath3 and bloch wave functions is hard to capture from these equations . as a result , it would be very helpful if one could find an alternative way to understand the polarization structure and the computation results .",
    "for instance , what determines the polarization at individual @xmath2 point , and why @xmath3 maximizes at the @xmath34 point ?",
    "in the next section , we attempt a scheme which we wish to be able to offer a more intuitive understanding of the polarization structure .",
    "as mentioned above , eq.([ephi_1 ] ) and eq.([ephi_2 ] ) give us little intuitive sense on the direct @xmath2 dependence of the berry s phase . in order to get more insight",
    ", we use wannier functions to analyze the polarization structure .",
    "previously , wannier functions have been found very useful in analyzing real - space local polarization@xcite .",
    "here we employ the wannier - function approach for a different purpose , namely to understand the @xmath2-dependence of the polarization structure .",
    "the wannier functions are defined as @xmath66 or @xmath67 where @xmath68 runs over the whole real - space lattice vectors . by substituting eq.([ewa ] ) into eq.([ephi_1 ] ) and carrying out analytically the integral over @xmath15 , it is straightforward to derive , for tetragonal perovskites , the polarization at individual @xmath2 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the projection of vector @xmath71 along the polarization direction , @xmath72 is the projection of lattice vector @xmath68 onto the plane perpendicular to the polarization direction . for convenience of discussion , we separate the sum over @xmath72 into the @xmath73 term and the rests , @xmath74 where for @xmath73 , @xmath75 is the phase contribution from the same unit cell .",
    "eq.([ewphi ] ) is the basis for understanding the polarization structure . from this equation , we observe the following .",
    "first , it is now clear that the @xmath2-dependent part of @xmath3 comes only from the @xmath76 terms , which correspond to the overlap of the wannier functions in neighboring cells . in other words , the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath3 phase results from the overlap of the wannier functions of different cells that are displaced by @xmath72 from each other within the plane that is perpendicular to the direction of polarization .",
    "while the choice of the wannier function is known to be non - unique due to the gauge uncertainty , the sum of the wannier - function overlap over occupied bands is a uniquely defined quality which does not depend on the gauge .",
    "it is this quantity that determines the shape of the polarization structure .",
    "second , eq.([ewphi ] ) explains why the bandwidth of polarization dispersion is often much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "since only the second term in this equation is @xmath2 dependent , and since the wannier functions are generally well localized compared to the size of unit cell , one expects the overlap @xmath77 to be much smaller than unity for @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical results in fig.[fpt ] , namely , @xmath79 .",
    "third , since the dispersion in @xmath3 comes from the overlap of the wannier functions between cells of different @xmath72s in the _ xy_-inplane directions , it explains why the polarization structure is very sensitive to inplane strain , where by changing inplane lattice constant , the distances between neighboring cells are effectively altered .",
    "meanwhile , we recognize that a precise understanding of how the bandwidth depends on the inplane strain is not as simple as one might think . naively one tends to think that , with the decline of inplane lattice constant , the dispersion is to increase , since the overlap @xmath80 increases when @xmath72 decreases .",
    "this will lead to the widening of the polarization dispersion width , which is opposite to what we found in fig.[fpt_str ] .",
    "this puzzling contradiction can be resolved by noticing that , in addition to being dependent on the overlap strength between @xmath81 and @xmath82 within the _ perpendicular _ plane , the dispersion width also hinges on the localization length ( @xmath83 ) of the wannier functions along the direction _",
    "parallel _ to the polarization , as a result of the @xmath70 operator in eq.([ewphi ] ) . with the increasing inplane strain",
    ", the @xmath83 is to shrink .",
    "we thus see that the bandwidth of polarization is determined by the balance of two competing factors between the increasing wannier - function overlap and the decreasing @xmath83 localization length .",
    "when the latter dominates , the bandwidth declines as we have seen in fig.[fpt_str ] from numerical calculations .",
    "with the general understanding of the polarization structure in the above section , we next attempt to determine analytically the polarization dispersion specifically for pbtio@xmath1 , aimed to obtain further insight into the important details of the polarization structure .",
    "as will become clear later , our analysis in the following also explains what determines the @xmath3 polarization at special points of @xmath23 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we begin by defining parameters @xmath84 and then , @xmath85    for dielectrics of insulating nature , wannier functions are highly localized , and decay exponentially with the distance @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath86 also decay quickly with the increase of @xmath87 , so we can adopt the tight - binding like approach and consider only several @xmath72s that correspond to some nearest neighbors ( nn ) .",
    "we consider up to the @xmath88 nns , where    @xmath89 taking advantage of tetragonal symmetry , we can rewrite eq.([ep_tb ] ) as @xmath90 \\\\",
    "+ 2t_2[\\cos(k_1+k_2)a + \\cos(k_1-k_2)a ] \\ ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the @xmath92 nns contribution defined in eq.(10 ) , and @xmath93 .",
    "this expression gives us a more direct sense of the @xmath0 polarization dispersion , approximated to the second nearest neighbors . at special @xmath2 points of @xmath23 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ,",
    "the phases are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "we could thus clearly see that the @xmath97 term , corresponding to @xmath73 , acts to rigidly shift the polarization curve as a whole .",
    "meanwhile , the phase relative to the @xmath37 ( i.e. , the dispersion ) is determined by the @xmath98 and @xmath99 quantities , and more specifically , @xmath100 these equations are useful , since they tell us that ( 1 ) the relative height at @xmath34 ( which contributes most to the polarization in pt ) , @xmath101 , is determined by @xmath98 , associated with the overlap of the wannier function in the @xmath102 nns .",
    "@xmath1030 for pbtio@xmath1 in equilibrium .",
    "( 2 ) under the assumption that @xmath99 is negligible , @xmath101 will be larger than @xmath104 by a factor of 2 .    within the second nearest - neighbor approximation",
    ", one can further determine analytically the dispersion along the @xmath105 line in the 2d brillouin zone as    @xmath106    the polarization structure could thus be expressed as a simple combination of cosine functions .    to examine whether the second - nn approximation is sufficient",
    ", we fit the analytical results to the numerical dft calculations to determine the @xmath91 ( @xmath107 ) parameters .",
    "note that only @xmath3s at three points (",
    "i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are fitted .",
    "the obtained @xmath91 values are given in table [ tpara ] .",
    "these values are then used to determine the whole dispersion curve , shown in fig.[fpt](b ) for pbtio@xmath1 in equilibrium structure of @xmath108 .",
    "we could see that the analytical curve agrees well with the dft result , implying that the 2nd nn approximation works . on the other hand ,",
    "some fine structure of the curve ( such as the small local maximum along the @xmath25 ) can not be reproduced , where for a better fitting , approximation beyond the 2nd nns would be necessary .",
    ".the fitting @xmath98 and @xmath99 parameters for pbtio@xmath1 at different lattice constants .",
    "@xmath97 is not shown here since it does not affect dispersion . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table [ tpara ] one can also see how the @xmath91 quantities are influenced by inplane strain .",
    "@xmath98 declines substantially as @xmath29 decreases below 3.80 , while @xmath99 shows a less dependence on inplane strain .",
    "this makes sense since , by varying the inplane strain , the main effect lies in altering the nearest - neighbor interaction among wannier functions . for @xmath109 , @xmath110",
    "approximately equals 2@xmath111 , confirming the importance of the nearest neighbor interaction . for large strains of @xmath112 , @xmath110 and @xmath113",
    "become comparable , for which it is likely that higher orders of nns are also needed .",
    "it is of interest to compare the polarization dispersions between batio@xmath1 ( bt ) and pbtio@xmath1 ( pt ) , since these two substances have rather different tetragonality , magnitude of polarization , and sizes of a - site atoms . for this purpose ,",
    "we have studied the polarization structure in bt , for which a tetragonal symmetry is enforced so that a direct comparison with pt can be made .",
    "following the same procedure as for pt , we optimize the cell structure and atomic positions of bt at different inplane lattice constants , and calculate the corresponding polarization structures .",
    "fig.[fbt ] displays the polarization structure for batio@xmath1 at different inplane lattice constants .",
    "let us first focus on the dispersion of the equilibrium batio@xmath1 .",
    "the lda - calculated equilibrium inplane lattice constant of bt is @xmath114 . apart from similarities to pt ( e.g.",
    ", @xmath115 maximizes at @xmath34 ) , our calculations reveal some interesting differences between pt and bt under zero strain : ( 1 ) the bt dispersion curve has a significantly smaller bandwidth ( @xmath480.42 ) than that of pt ( @xmath480.57 ) . since the bandwidth",
    "is determined by the difference @xmath101 , i.e. , by @xmath98 , a smaller bandwidth indicates less overlapping wannier s functions between nearest neighbors in batio@xmath1 , which could be explained by the larger inplane lattice constant @xmath29 for bt at equilibrium .",
    "( 2 ) unlike pt , the polarization in bt is not small at @xmath33 .",
    "this again can be attributed to the large inplane lattice constant in bt , which leads to a negligible contribution from the 2nd nns , i.e. , @xmath99 is small in bt .",
    "indeed , we numerically found that @xmath99 is -0.007 in bt , compared to 0.031 in pt . by eq.([edif ] ) , @xmath116 is about half of the @xmath117 value if @xmath99 is small , which is indeed born out in fig.[fbt ] .",
    "( 3)as a consequence of observation ( 2 ) , the dispersions of bt and pt along the @xmath118 are not quite similar .",
    "there is a local maximum between @xmath25 for pt , whereas for bt , no local maximum exists and @xmath33 becomes a saddle point .    upon strain , batio@xmath1 and pbtio@xmath1 exhibit sharp difference in their strain dependence of dispersion bandwidth .",
    "as we saw previously in fig.[fpt_str ] , inplane strain causes the bandwidth declining for pbtio@xmath1 .",
    "however , for batio@xmath1 , a dramatic _ enlargement _ in bandwidth occurs , when @xmath29 decreases from 3.95 to 3.85 .",
    "the bandwidth maintains a large value at @xmath29=3.75 , after which it starts to drop .",
    "in batio@xmath1 the polarization dispersion bandwidth thus shows an interesting non - monotonous dependence on inplane strain .",
    "this characteristic non - monotonous dependence strongly supports our conjecture that the two competing factors determine the bandwidth , as described above in section iv .",
    "when strain is small in bt , the overlapping of wannier functions located at the nearest neighboring @xmath72s plays a dominant role , and the increasing overlap leads to a larger @xmath110 and thus larger bandwidth .",
    "as inplane strain becomes large ( @xmath119 ) , the atom - atom interaction along the @xmath28-axis is considerably weakened due to elongated @xmath28-lattice length . as a consequence ,",
    "the shrinking @xmath83 localization length of wannier functions along the @xmath70 direction takes over and becomes dominant , giving rise to the declining bandwidth .",
    "this , once again , reveals that the polarization dispersion contains rich information . to make more quantitative comparison",
    ", we replot in fig.[fx1x2 ] the strain dependence of the @xmath3 phases at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , relative to the @xmath37 point .",
    "fig.[fx1x2 ] is of some useful value since it allows us to contrast the @xmath2-specific polarizations in two materials at _ the same _ fixed inplane lattice constant .",
    "the difference between bt and pt is thus not related in a significant sense to atom - atom distance , but largely due to the overlap of respective wannier functions . in fig.[fx1x2 ] , both @xmath116 and @xmath117 are seen to be far greater in batio@xmath1 than in pbtio@xmath1 , for a fixed @xmath29 constant .",
    "the greater values of @xmath3 in bt could possibly originate from the fact that the wannier functions in this material is more spreading due to the larger size of ba atom .    from the comparison between pt and bt",
    ", we could see that the polarization structure has some common features for materials with similar structure , and meanwhile , some distinctions revealing the identities of materials .",
    "the common features allow us to understand the polarization structure in general , just as for band structure , most iii - v semiconductors have direct band gaps .",
    "differences in polarization structure manifest the electron wave functions and interatomic interactions on microscopic scale .",
    "two different approaches are employed to study the polarization structure in perovskite ferroelectrics .",
    "numerically we use the density functional total - energy calculations and the modern theory of polarization .",
    "analytically we formulate a scheme to describe the @xmath2 dependence of the polarization phase using wannier functions . by parameterizing the wannier - function overlapping",
    ", we further identify the quantities that determine the @xmath3 phases at special @xmath2 points of interest .",
    "our specific findings are summarized in the following .    for pbtio@xmath1 at equilibrium ,",
    "( i ) the @xmath3 phase maximizes at the brillouin zone boundary of the 2d @xmath2 plane , not the zone center .",
    "( ii ) the polarization structure shows little dispersion along the @xmath25 line .",
    "however , the dispersion is large along the @xmath26 .",
    "( iii ) the bandwidth of the dispersion curve is far below 2@xmath120 .",
    "the small dispersion considerably eases the difficulty in assigning the correct branch of individual @xmath2 phase , but caution still needs to be taken when the @xmath3 phase is approaching @xmath22 .",
    "analytically , ( iv ) the expression , eq.([ewphi ] ) , is given as the basis for understanding the polarization structure .",
    "it also explains why the polarization bandwidth is small compared to @xmath22 .",
    "( v ) the polarization phase at individual @xmath2 is revealed to depend on the competition of two factors , namely the overlapping strength of wannier functions within the perpendicular @xmath121 plane and the localization length @xmath83 of these wannier functions .",
    "( vi ) within the 2nn approximation , the @xmath116 and @xmath117 values in ferroelectric perovskite are found to be @xmath122 , @xmath123 . if @xmath99 is negligible , the latter is 2 times of the former .",
    "( vii ) when pbtio@xmath1 is under compressive inplane strain , the polarization bandwidth is found to decrease , whereas the total polarization increases .",
    "the declining bandwidth implies that the localization length @xmath83 of wannier functions plays a dominating role in pbtio@xmath1 .    by comparing batio@xmath1 with pbtio@xmath1 ,",
    "we show ( viii ) the equilibrium bt exhibits a smaller bandwidth of 0.42 , as compared to the bandwidth of 0.57 in pt .",
    "( ix ) @xmath116 in batio@xmath1 is not small , unlike pt .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that @xmath99 is negligible in bt , leading to the result that @xmath116 is about half of the value of @xmath117 .",
    "but in pt , @xmath99 can not be neglected , and acts to offset the @xmath98 contribution , giving rise to smaller @xmath116 and flat dispersion along the @xmath25 line .",
    "( x ) as batio@xmath1 is under increasing inplane strains , its polarization bandwidth displays a characteristic non - monotonous variation by first increasing dramatically and then declining .",
    "the finding lends a support to the qualitative understanding that two competing factors determine the @xmath3 phase .",
    "( xi ) when batio@xmath1 and pbtio@xmath1 are constrained to the same inplane lattice constant , the @xmath116 and @xmath117 are shown to be significantly larger in bt than in pt , unlike the case when two materials are in equilibrium .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that there are still many aspects of polarization structure we do not yet understand .",
    "for example , we have not pursued beyond the 2nd nearest neighbors to explain the local maximum between @xmath23 and @xmath33 in unstrained pt .",
    "we also do not know the physical significance when @xmath116 changes from a local minimum to a saddle point as displayed in fig.[fpt_str ] for pbtio@xmath1 under strains .",
    "we believe that further analysis of the polarization structure could yield better knowledge on the physics of dielectrics .",
    "like band structure of solids , we hope that the polarization structure can provide us a new tool of studying ferroelectric materials and properties .",
