    "has recently been under intensive study by various theoretical approaches such as plane - wave expansion ( pwe ) @xcite , scaling technique parnell08b , aadw , asymptotics of multiple - scattering theory @xcite and a newly proposed monodromy - matrix ( mm ) method @xcite .",
    "the cases treated were mostly confined to scalar waves in 2d ( two - dimensional ) structures . regarding vector waves in 2d and especially in 3d phononic crystals ,",
    "a variety of methods have been proposed for calculating the quasistatic effective elastic properties of 3d periodic composites containing spherical inclusions arranged in a simple cubic array . for the case of rigid inclusions",
    "an integral equation on the sphere surface was solved numerically to obtain the effective properties @xcite .",
    "spherical voids @xcite and subsequently elastic inclusions were considered using a fourier series approach @xcite .",
    "alternative procedures for elastic spherical inclusions include the method of singular distributions @xcite and infinite series of periodic multipole solutions of the equilibrium equations @xcite .",
    "the latter multipole expansion method has also been applied to cubic arrays of ellipsoidal inclusions @xcite .",
    "a particular pwe - based method of calculation of quasistatic speeds in 3d phononic crystals of cubic symmetry has been formulated and implemented in @xcite .",

    "of all the methods available for calculating effective elastic moduli the pwe method is arguably the simplest and most straightforward to implement .",
    "it requires only fourier coefficients of the inclusion in the unit cell , which makes it the method of choice for many problems .",
    "unfortunately , pwe is not a very practical tool for the 3d case , where the vectors and matrices in the fourier space are of very large algebraic dimension , especially if the phononic crystal is composed of highly contrasting materials ( examples in  [ sec5 ] illustrate this critical drawback ) .",
    "the present paper provides the pwe and mm analytical formulations of the 21 components of the effective elastic stiffness for 3d solid - solid phononic crystals of arbitrary anisotropy and arbitrary oblique lattice .",
    "while the pwe method is widely used in some fields its formulation for general anisotropic static elasticity has , surprisingly , not been discussed before .",
    "the pwe is presented here in a compact form ( see eq .   ) suitable for numerical implementation .",
    "the main thrust of the paper is concerned with the mm approach .",
    "the motivation for advocating this method as an alternative to the more conventional pwe technique is , first , that the mm method spares fourier expansion in one of the coordinates ( this is particularly advantageous for the 3d numerics ) and , second , that the mm method has much faster convergence than pwe .",
    "comparison of the mm and pwe calculations provided in the paper confirms a markedly better efficiency of the mm method .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the quasistatic perturbation theory is used to define the effective christoffel equation in the form which serves as the common starting point for the pwe and mm methods .",
    "the pwe formulation of the effective elastic moduli follows readily and is also presented in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "the mm formulation is described in section [ sec3 ] : the derivation of the mm formula is in  [ sec3.1 ] ( see also appendix 1 ) , its numerical implementation is discussed in  [ sec3.2 ] , generalization to the case of an oblique lattice is presented in  [ 3.4 ] and the scheme for recovering the full set of effective elastic moduli is provided in  [ full ] . a closed - form estimate of the effective christoffel matrix is presented in section [ sec4 ] .",

    "we present the effective longitudinal and transverse speeds @xmath348 and @xmath349 in the principal direction as functions of the volume fraction of steel inclusions ( fig .",

    "[ fig1]b that the results of both methods monotonically converge from above to the exact value with growing @xmath306 in agreement with the general statement of  [ sec4 ] .",
    "what is significant is that the convergence of the mm method is seen to be much faster than that of the pwe method .",
    "in fact , the explicit mm estimate for @xmath309 which follows from in the form @xmath352 provides a much better estimate for @xmath348 and @xmath349 at @xmath353 than the pwe calculation with @xmath354 i.e. with matrices of about 4000@xmath3554000 size . note that as @xmath356 in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the bound may be approximated , yielding @xmath357 at the same time the geometry of the unit cell for @xmath356 indicates that the modulus @xmath358 can be estimated by an equivalent medium stratified in the @xmath359direction , for which the uniaxial strain assumption with constant stress @xmath360 leads to the approximation @xmath361 , the same as the right hand side of ( as @xmath362 .",
    "this , combined with the fact that @xmath363 tends to zero faster than @xmath364 as @xmath356 , explains the exceptional accuracy of the new bound as an estimate for the moduli .",

    "the second example considers a cubic lattice of spheroidal steel inclusions in epoxy matrix .",
    "the shape of the inclusion evolves from formally a disk of unit diameter to a ball of unit diameter ( that is , inscribed in a cubic unit cell ) by means of elongating the radius along the @xmath365 direction , see fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) and by the mm method with @xmath350 and @xmath351 ( dotted , dashed and solid lines in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the mm method is particularly efficient for the case in hand since it uses fourier coefficients in the @xmath370 plane where the inclusions have circular cross - section and performs direct numerical integration of the riccati equation ( see  [ sec3.2 ] ) along the direction @xmath365 where the shape is distorted. we observe an interesting feature of a drastic increase of the effective longitudinal speed @xmath348 and of the modulus @xmath367 when the inclusions tend to touch each other , see fig.[fig3]a .",
    "this type of configuration where the inclusions are almost touching is known to be particularly difficult for numerical calculation of the effective properties @xcite .",
    "mm appears to be particularly well suited to treating such problems with closely spaced inclusions since it explicitly accounts for the thin gap region via integration of the riccati equation .",
    "the pwe method , on the other hand , clearly fails to capture the sharp increase in wave speed at @xmath351 ( matrix size @xmath371 4000@xmath3724000 ) . in fact",
    ", the pwe for @xmath369 does not even satisfy the strict upper bounds derived from mm at @xmath309 .",
    "the pwe and mm methods of calculating quasistatic effective speeds in three - dimensional phononic crystals have been formulated and compared .",
    "the mm method can be viewed as a two - dimensional pwe combined with a one - dimensional propagator matrix approach .",
    "the propagator part of the mm scheme is calculated by numerical integration of a ( nonlinear ) riccati differential equation to produce the monodromy matrix .",
    "it was shown both analytically and numerically that the mm method provides more accurate approximations than the pwe scheme .",
    "in particular , the closed form mm bounds ( see also ) using only one fourier mode to estimate the effective speed gives better approximations than pwe bounds using more than a thousand ( eleven in each of @xmath373 , @xmath374 ) fourier modes in the case of densely packed structures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b for @xmath375 ) .",
    "the speed - up of the mm method as compared with pwe via reduction in matrix size is particularly significant for the three - dimensional homogenization problem .",
    "thus , numerical implementation of the pwe scheme needs a matrix of dimension @xmath376 , requiring a considerable amount of computer memory even for small @xmath306 .",
    "by contrast , the mm scheme uses matrices of dimension @xmath377 .",
    "the reduced memory requirement for the mm method is at the cost of the computer time needed to solve the riccati equation , a relatively small price to pay .",
    "in fact , the ability to set the step size in the runge - kutta scheme enables the mm method to efficiently and accurately solve configurations for which the pwe is particularly ill - suited , such as narrow gaps ( see fig .",
