    "additionally , for small @xmath18 the wavenumber found in simulation does not deviate markedly from its critical value suggesting that the large scale counterflow is not responsible for the wavenumber shift observed in experiment near threshold regardless of the spatial extent of the domain .",
    "we also investigated the possibility that the vertical large scale counterflow could bifurcate into a horizontal flow similar to the mean flow in the presence of a slight spatial asymmetry .",

    "lastly , the possibility of wavenumber pinning was studied by varying the aspect ratio in increments of less than half of a roll width for both the two- and three - dimensional domains . in all of the scenarios tested the final pattern wavenumbers were not appreciably affected by these small changes in aspect ratio .",
    "we have analytically and numerically investigated pattern formation in a cylindrical convection layer with a radial ramp in plate separation . in particular , we have studied quantitatively the effects of two large scale flows ; large scale counterflow and mean flow .",
    "these large scale flows are important theoretically yet are extremely difficult to measure experimentally .",
    "our results suggest that the mean flow plays an important role in the observed pattern wavenumber and is generated in a novel way , by the spatial variation of @xmath88 driven by the variation of @xmath0 rather than the more usual variations in roll curvature and wavenumber .",

    "although the large scale counterflow is present at and near threshold it does not appear responsible for the dramatic wavenumber shift to values less than critical as seen in experiment .",
    "although it is too expensive computationally to simulate the very large systems used in the experiments we can use our quantitative understanding of the ramp - generated mean flow , validated by the simulations at smaller aspect ratio , to extrapolate our results to these larger systems .",
