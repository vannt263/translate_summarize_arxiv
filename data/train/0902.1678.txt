    "the lhc physics program is rich and has been widely described  @xcite .",
    "it encompasses the searches for new particles up to masses of several tev , including the elucidation of electroweak symmetry breaking and the possible observation of new symmetries at higher scales , and precision measurements of fundamental parameters in the electroweak and strong gauge sectors .",
    "a common requirement for this program to succeed is a good control of the proton parton densities . to be more specific",
    ", the discovery of the higgs boson , and subsequent measurements of its couplings relies on precise predictions of the gluon density in the range @xmath0 , and at corresponding scales @xmath1 .",
    "the high-@xmath2 , high-@xmath3 gluon density also determines the production rate of high-@xmath4 jets , and affects e.g. the measurement of the running of @xmath5 and the search for extra dimensions through this final state .",
    "the lhc also allows to reach very low values of @xmath2 as it is indicated in fig .",
    "[ kinplane ] .",
    "dedicated processes at lhc will allow to study the low @xmath2 region in detail as we will see in the following , for instance using mueller - navelet jets .",
    "in addition , the saturation region where the gluon density is large and gluons overlap in the proton might be accessible at lhc as we will discuss it further .",
    "( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) domain probed by the fixed target , hera , tevatron and lhc experiments . ]    the on - shell production of electroweak gauge bosons is mainly controlled by the sea quarks . in this case",
    "@xmath3 is essentially fixed , but the vector boson rapidity distribution probes the range @xmath6 .",
    "precise measurements of the electroweak parameters , notably the @xmath7 boson mass @xmath8 and the weak mixing angle , @xmath9 , require tightly constrained parton densities in this range .",
    "the interpretation of high - mass drell - yan events or gauge boson pairs in terms of electroweak interactions again requires a good control of these densities at scales up to @xmath10 .    in the process of quantifying the pdf - induced uncertainties on the above observables , and improving them where needed , one has to remember the hypotheses under which the pdfs have been determined in the first place . in particular , the dependence of the results on the choice of functional form of the parton densities at @xmath11 can often not be ignored .",
    "hypotheses concerning the initial flavor composition ( u , d , s and possibly c quarks ) need to be accounted for as well .",
    "in addition , the qcd evolution of these densities is performed assuming different schemes ( dokshitzer gribov lipatov altarelli parisi , dglap  @xcite , balitski fadin kuraev lipatov , bfkl  @xcite ) , perturbative orders ( leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) ) , including saturation effects or not .",
    "when quoting a pdf - induced uncertainty , one needs to ascertain whether these underlying hypotheses affect the result or can be ignored .    in the following , we review the most prominent examples of the influence of parton densities on the lhc physics program .",
    "after an introduction about the status of pdf determination and their uncertainties , coming mainly from fixed target experiments and from hera , we discuss briefly the input from the tevatron .",
    "the third section describes how lhc measurements are sensitive to gluon pdf and how to reduce its uncertainty .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to quark pdf .",
    "the last section deals with observables less sensitive to pdf uncertainties to look for beyond standard model effects ; we can quote for instance ratios of cross sections with the goal to measure separately a subset of parton densities or to reduce the impact of the pdf uncertainties .",
    "the understanding of the proton structure has made great progress since the observation of the broken scale invariance in the early 70 s .",
    "the measurement of the proton structure function at hera in the h1 and zeus experiment allowed to make considerable progress on the knowledge of the proton structure  @xcite .",
    "the hera data allowed to constrain strongly the pdf uncertainties at medium @xmath12 , and allowed to access a completely new kinematical region in @xmath2 down to 10@xmath13 .",
    "these data are fundamental to get precise cross sections at lhc for beyond standard model effects and the background . in this section",
    ", we will only summarize the status on the pdf uncertainties since many reviews described already the impact of hera on pdf determination  @xcite .    according to the last version of global qcd fits , the uncertainties on the quark and gluon densities in the proton reach few per - cent in most of the kinematic plane in ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "however , at lhc , the uncertainty on parton distributions leads to one of the most important uncertainties for many measurements , greater than the expected statistical errors , and thus reduce the sensitivity of these measurements to new physics effects .",
    "several reasons explain why pdf - induced uncertainties on observables can be so large and why they must be quoted with critical thinking .    first , the uncertainties on pdfs come from the uncertainties on parameters of the functional form at @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters are the output of global qcd fits on data ( fixed - target , hera , and tevatron experiments ) .",
    "valence quark pdfs can be essentially measured in the high-@xmath2 region , so the largest uncertainties ( @xmath15 ) on valence quark distributions are found at low @xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) and very high @xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the uncertainty on sea quark and gluon distributions reaches 20% at high @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) . this is due to the lack of data on processes using sea quarks and gluon in this region and to the rapid fall off of the parton distributions at high @xmath2 . at hadron colliders ,",
    "many measurements are sensitive to a large @xmath2 or @xmath3 range , and not only to the intermediate region @xmath19 in which pdfs are best known .",
    "large uncertainties on pdfs are found at high @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) or low-@xmath2 ( @xmath20 ) , and the error can be greater than 20% .",
    "thus , precise measurements at lhc could help to reduce the errors on pdf and improve our knowledge of the proton substructure .",
    "second , one has to remember the hypotheses under which the pdfs have been determined in the first place . in particular , the dependence of the results on the choice of the functional form of the parton densities at @xmath14 can often not be ignored .",
    "these hypotheses are needed to decrease the numbers of degrees of freedom in qcd fits , but the systematic uncertainty induced by such approximations can not be evaluated any longer with one single pdf set . among these assumptions , the ratio of the @xmath21 sea quark pdfs in the asymptotic low @xmath2 region are often set to one , the sea quark and antiquark densities at @xmath22 often have the same parametrization , etc",
    ". hypotheses concerning the initial flavor composition need to be accounted for as well .",
    "the description of the strange quark and antiquark distributions at @xmath22 may require additional degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the proton could have an intrinsic charm quark component at @xmath14 , thus enhancing the rate of charm quark - induced processes  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the extraction of heavy flavour pdfs and the comparison to data is still difficult and suffers from large statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the impact at higher scale of some approximations can be tested using different sets of pdfs , because the underlying hypotheses on the functional form are different . as an example , the effects of the underlying hypotheses can be seen in fig .",
    "[ xq10 ] , where some differences are visible at @xmath23 for valence quark distributions .",
    "the hypotheses on the shape of pdf at @xmath22 have to be tested when measurements become more and more precise .",
    "the lhc will play a major role in testing the pdf functional form .",

    "the evolution equation can also be computed at different perturbative orders ( lo , nlo , nnlo in @xmath5 for dglap and leading log ( ll ) , next - to - leading log ( nll ) in @xmath26 for bfkl ) , including the appropriate treatment of the mass of heavy quarks and the evolution of the strong coupling constant at low @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , saturation effects could be strong at low @xmath3 and very low @xmath2 . due to the large ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) domain accessible at lhc , many measurements are sensitive to these effects , and",
    "thus can bring constraints on evolution equations .    in the following ,",
    "we describe which measurements at lhc can bring information on the proton structure , and thus help not only to reduce the pdf uncertainties , but also to test the hypotheses on the initial shape of pdfs at @xmath22 and to test the evolution equations .",
    "prospects for improvements and their difficulties will be presented in this context .    before describing the expected results from lhc",
    ", we will give the qcd results obtained at tevatron .",
    "the hera results are described in detail in ref .",
    "the first measurement sensitive to pdfs which can be performed at tevatron is the inclusive jet cross section which relies on the precise determination of the jet energy calibration .",
    "we will describe briefly how the jet energy is obtained at tevatron since similar methods can be used at lhc .",
    "the jet energy scale is determined mainly using @xmath28jet events . in the d0 collaboration as an example , the corrected jet energy is obtained using the following method @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the corrected and uncorrected jet energies . the offset corrections ( @xmath32 )",
    "are related to uranium noise and pile - up and are determined using minimum - bias and zero - bias data .",
    "the showering corrections ( @xmath33 ) take into account the energy emitted outside the jet cone because of the detector and dead material and , of course , not the physics showering outside the jet cone which corresponds to qcd radiation outside the cone . the jet response ( @xmath34 ) is the largest correction , and can be subdivided in few corrections .",
    "the first step is to equalize the calorimeter response as a function of rapidity , and the jet response is then measured for the central part of the calorimeter only using the @xmath35 balance in @xmath28jet events .",
    "some additional small corrections related to the method biases are introduced .",
    "one important additional correction deals with the difference in response between quark and gluon jets .",
    "the difference was studied both in data and in monte carlo ( using for instance the @xmath28jet and the dijet samples which are respectively quark and gluon dominated ) and leads to a difference of 4 to 6% as a function of jet @xmath35 , which is not negligible if one wants a precision on jet energy scale of the order of 1% .",
    "this has an important consequence .",
    "the jet energy scale is not universal but sample dependent .",
    "qcd jets ( gluon dominated ) will have a different correction with respect to the @xmath36 events for instance which are quark dominated .",
    "the cdf collaboration follows a method which is more monte carlo oriented using beam tests and single pion response to tune their monte carlo . at lhc",
    ", it will be possible to use @xmath37jets which do not suffer from the ambiguity of photon identification in the detector .",
    "the uncertainties reached by the d0 collaboration concerning the determination of jet energy scale are of the order of 1.2% for jet @xmath35 between 70 - 400 gev in a wide range of rapidity around zero ( the uncertainty is of the order of 2% for a rapidity of 2.5 ) .",
    "this allows to make a very precise measurement of the jet inclusive cross section as a function of their transverse momentum .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section  @xcite was performed by the d0 and cdf collaborations at tevatron using a jet cone algorithm with a cone size of 0.7 ( d0 and cdf ) and the @xmath38 algorithm ( cdf ) .",
    "data are corrected to hadron level ( d0 ) or parton level ( cdf ) .",
    "the motivation of this measurement is double : it is sensitive to beyond standard model effects such as quark substructure and to pdfs , especially the gluon density at high @xmath2 .",
    "historically , the excess observed by the cdf collaboration in 1995 concerning the inclusive jet @xmath35 spectrum compared to the parametrisations was suspected to be a signal of quark substructure but it was found that increasing the gluon density at high @xmath2 could accomodate these data .",
    "this raises the question of pdfs versus beyond standard model effects , and the interpretation of data in general .",
    "data are compared with nlo qcd calculations using either cteq6.5 m  @xcite for d0 or cteq6.1 for cdf ( the uncertainties of the cteq6.5 m parametrisation are two times smaller ) .",
    "a good agreement is found over six orders of magnitude .",
    "the ratio data over theory for the d0 and cdf measurements are given in figs .",
    "[ inclusive1 ] and [ inclusive2 ] .",
    "a good agreement is found between nlo qcd and the d0 or cdf measurements with a tendency of the cteq parametrisation to be slightly lower than the data at high jet @xmath35 .",
    "the mrst2004  @xcite parametrisation follows the shape of the measurements .",
    "given the precision obtained on jet energy scale , the uncertainties obtained by the d0 collaboration are lower than the pdf ones and will allow to constrain further the pdfs and specially the gluon density at high @xmath2 ( the uncertainties of the measurement performed by the cdf collaboration are about two times larger ) .",
    "an update of the cteq and mrst pdfs using these latest data are expected soon .",
    "the d0 collaboration took also special care of the uncertainty correlation studies , by giving the effects of the 24 sources of systematics in data .",
    "in addition , the cdf collaboration measured the dijet mass cross section  @xcite above 180 gev , and up to 1.2 tev .",
    "no excess was found with respect to nlo qcd calculations and this measurement allows to exclude excited quarks below 870 gev , @xmath39 ( resp .",
    "@xmath40 ) below 740 ( resp . 840 ) gev   and @xmath39 mass limits come from lepton based searches . ] , and technirho below 1.1 tev .",
    "the question rises if pdfs can be further constrained at lhc using inclusive measurements .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are typically of the order of 15% for a jet @xmath35 of 1 tev , and 25% of 2 tev for @xmath41 ( without taking into account the new tevatron measurements which we just discussed ) . a typical uncertainty of 5% ( resp .",
    "1% ) on jet energy scale leads to a systematic uncertainty on 30 to 50% ( resp .",
    "6 to 10% ) on the jet cross section .",
    "a precise determination of the jet energy scale at lhc will thus be needed to get competitive measurements at lhc . in the following",
    ", we will discuss more clever ways to find observables less sensitive to pdf uncertainties but still sensitive to beyond standard model effects .",
    "the measurement of multijet cross sections at the tevatron and at hera ( and later on at lhc ) is fundamental to constrain the pdfs and to tune the monte carlo , since it is a direct background entering in many searches for higgs bosons or new particles at the lhc .",
    "we can quote for instance the search for higgs bosons in association with @xmath42 , the measurement of the @xmath42 production cross section , the search for @xmath43-parity violated susy ( which can lead up to 8 - 10 jets per event ... ) .",
    "the advantage of the measurement of the difference in azimuthal angle between two leading jets in an inclusive qcd sample as was performed by the do collaboration is that there is no need of precise knowledge of jet energy scale ( the measurement is dominated by the knowledge of jet angles ) and this can be performed at the beginning of data taking at the lhc for instance when the detectors are not yet fully calibrated .",
    "the @xmath44 spectrum was measured in four different regions in maximum jet transverse momentum , and a good agreement was found with nlo calculations using either the cteq and mrst parametrisations except at very high @xmath44 where soft radiation is missing  @xcite .",
    "pythia  @xcite shows a disagreement at small @xmath44 , showing a lack of initial state gluon radiation , while herwig  @xcite shows a good agreement with data .",
    "it will be important to redo this kind of measurements at the beginning of lhc .",
    "the d0 collaboration measured the inclusive production of isolated @xmath45 jets in different detector regions requiring a central photon and a central or a forward jet .",
    "it distinguished the cases when the photon and the jet are on the same or opposite side .",
    "the cross section has been found in disagreement with nlo qcd expectations both in shape and normalisation and the reason is still unclear  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the transverse momentum of the photon is not very high for that measurement , and may be the problem is related to the fact that it is not performed where perturbative qcd can be trusted .",
    "we will come back on that kind of measurement when we discuss the possibilities at lhc .",
    "the jet shape is dictated by multi - gluon emission from primary partons , and is sensitive to quark / gluon contents , pdfs and running @xmath5 , as well as underlying events .",
    "we define @xmath46 which is sensitive to the way the energy is spread around the jet center @xmath47 where @xmath43 is the jet size .",
    "the energy is more concentrated towards the jet center for quark than for gluon jets since there is more qcd radiation for gluon jets ( which means that @xmath46 is closer to one for quark jets when @xmath48 for instance ) . the cdf collaboration measured @xmath49 for jets with @xmath50 as a function of jet @xmath35 and found higher values of @xmath46 at high @xmath35 as expected since jets are more quark like  @xcite and this is well described by qcd expectations .",
    "this measurement also helps tuning the pythia and herwig generators since it is sensitive to underlying events in particular .",
    "the cdf collaboration also studied the jet shapes for @xmath51-jets in four different @xmath35 bins  @xcite since it is sensitive to the @xmath51-quark content of the proton , and the result is given in fig .",
    "[ bjets ] .",
    "the default pythia and herwig monte carlo in black full and dashed lines respectively are unable to describe the measurement .",
    "compared to the inclusive jet shape depicted in fig .",
    "[ bjets ] in full red line for pythia , the tendency of the @xmath51-jet shape is definitely the right one , leading to smaller values of @xmath46 as expected , but the measurement leads to a larger difference .",
    "the effect of reducing the single @xmath51-quark fraction by 20% leads to a better description of data as it shown in green in fig .",
    "[ bjets ] .",
    "the fraction of @xmath51-jets that originate from flavour creation ( where a single @xmath51-quark is expected in the same jet cone ) over those that originate from gluon splitting ( where two @xmath51-quarks are expected in the same jet cone ) is different in monte carlo and data .",
    "this will be an important measurement to perform again at lhc since it is a direct background to searches for the higgs boson and for new phenomena .",
    "the cdf collaboration also measured the @xmath52 dijet cross section as a function of the leading jet @xmath35 and the difference in azimuthal angle between the two jets and it leads to the same conclusion , namely that pythia and herwig underestimates the gluon splitting mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this section is not directly related to the proton structure but understanding underlying events is a necessary step prior constraining further the proton structure .",
    "we will not mention further this aspect in the following but wanted to stress it while discussing the main results from tevatron .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured underlying events at tevatron and used these measurements to tune in particular the pythia generator .",
    "@xmath53 or @xmath54 interactions are namely not as simple as interactions in @xmath55 colliders .",
    "in addition to the hard scattering producing dijets , high @xmath35 leptons ... , spectator partons produce additional soft interactions called underlying events .",
    "the main consequence is that it introduces additional energy in the detector not related to the main interaction which needs to be corrected .    to study this kind of events ,",
    "the idea is quite simple .",
    "it is for instance possible to use dijet events and we can distinguish in azimuthal angle three different regions : the  toward \" region around the leading jet direction defined by a cone of 60 degrees around the jet axis , the  away",
    "\" region in the opposite direction to the jet , and the  transverse \" region the remaining regions far away from the jet and the  away \" region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ underlyingb ] .",
    "in dijet events , the  transverse \" region will be dominated by underlying events .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured the charged multiplicity and the charged transverse evergy as a function of jet transverse energy and used these quantities to tune the pythia monte carlo leading to the so called tune a and tune aw  @xcite .",
    "clean drell yan events can also be used to tune underlying events  @xcite .",
    "the lepton pair defines the  toward \" region while the  away \" and",
    " transverse \" regions are defined in the same way as for dijets . as an example",
    ", we give in fig .",
    "[ underlying ] the charged particle density as a function of the transverse momentum of the lepton pair in the three regions compared with the tune aw of pythia .    at lhc , one of the first measurements to be performed will be related to the tuning of underlying events in the generators .",
    "present tunings between the different monte carlo ( pythia , phojet , herwig ) show differences up to a factor six concerning the average multiplicity of charged particles as a function of the @xmath35 of the leading jet as an example , and it is crucial to tune the monte carlo to accomplish fully the lhc program .      the measurements of the @xmath56jet and @xmath37jet cross sections are specially important since they are a background for many searches and especially the search for the higgs boson .",
    "we will also study further the @xmath7 and @xmath57 production cross sections to show their sensitivities on pdfs and as a method to constrain them further in the following .",
    "the d0 collaboration measured the ratio of the @xmath59 to the inclusive cross section 0.074 @xmath60 0.019 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath61 ( syst . ) in agreement with nlo calculation  @xcite",

    "the cdf collaboration also compared the differential distributions in jet @xmath35 and rapidity as an example and the distributions are found in good agreeement with pythia .    after reviewing briefly the present status on the proton knowledge from hera and tevatron",
    ", we will now discuss what can be expected at lhc , concerning the gluon and quark densities in the proton .",
    "we review below the main physics items relying on the gluon density by studying two aspects : how does the physics at lhc ( mainly searches ) depend on the gluon uncertainty and how can we constrain it further using lhc data ?",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson , main objective and motivation for the construction of the lhc , is dominantly produced @xmath67 gluon fusion for the mass range 100  gev  @xmath68  1  tev .",
    "the hard cross section and the decay modes can be accurately computed ; for example , the nnlo qcd computation of fehip  @xcite claims a residual uncertainty of 1% on the production cross section , assuming standard model couplings .",
    "the decay modes as computed with hdecay  @xcite carry an even smaller uncertainty .",
    "the dominant residual uncertainty on @xmath69 at the lhc comes from the uncertainty on the gluon density , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ higgsprediction ]  @xcite . depending on the value of @xmath70 , the uncertainty varies between 5% and 10% .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , as can be seen on the figure , that the different pdf sets used ( mrst , cteq , alekhin ) are sometimes marginally compatible ; this examplifies the need to consider , in addition to the fit uncertainty claimed by each set , the framework ( theory , underlying hypotheses ) in which each fit has been performed .",
    "this level of uncertainty does not affect the discovery potential ( most often , signal and backgrounds are affected by the same uncertainty , which cancels in the ratio ; besides , other systematic uncertainties dominate , depending on @xmath70 and the final state considered ) . however , once the particle has been established and high statistics measurements of its couplings are underway , the gluon density will be the most significant source of theoretical uncertainty to the measurements .     higgs boson production cross section and its uncertainty , as a function of @xmath70 . ]    high-@xmath4 jets will be copiously produced at lhc : the expected cross section for @xmath71  tev is still about 20 pb . while this process has a high cross section and is dominantly coupled to initial gluons , and as such is a natural probe of the proton pdfs , it is also sensitive to new particles .",
    "scalar or vector @xmath62-channel resonances can appear in technicolor theories  @xcite ; graviton production is another possibility  @xcite ; as these processes display a peak in the invariant mass , these searches are relatively safe against pdf uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , certain theories with large compactification radius extra dimensions , or large number of extra dimensions , produce a continuum of kaluza - klein excitations , which appears as a modification of the slope of the differential cross section , @xmath72 .",

    "it is worth noticing that the saturation scale at hera or at the lhc is quite low .",
    "it was estimated for instance using inclusive @xmath229 measurements that the saturation scale is close to 1 gev@xmath216 at hera , and is expected to be around 1 - 2 gev@xmath216 at the lhc .",

    "the 3d si detector at 220 m can also provide a l1 trigger allowing to cut on the proton momentum loss ( the 420 m detector is too far away to make it to the l1 trigger ) .",
    "two kinds of trigger are considered .",
    "the first one triggers on events when both protons are detected at 220 m. the second ( more difficult ) triggers on events when only one proton is present at 220 m. in that case , the idea is to cut on the acceptance at 220 m corresponding to the possibility of a tag at 420 m. a typical jet trigger will be : two jets with a transverse momentum above 40 gev , one proton at 220 m with a momentum loss smaller than 0.05 compatible with the presence of a proton at 420 m on the other side , and the exclusiveness of the process ( most of the energy is carried by the two hard jets ) . with these cuts , the l1 rate is expected to be smaller than 1 khz for a luminosity smaller than 2.10@xmath269 @xmath270s@xmath169 . the expected output at l2 is assumed to be only a few hz only since the timing and the 420 m detector informations will be available at this stage .",

    "up to 35 interactions occur at the same bunch crossing and we need to know if the observed protons in the final state originate from the main interaction producing for instance the higgs boson or the @xmath231 event , or from a secondary one which is not related to the hard interaction . to achieve this goal",

    "the other device , quartic , uses quartz radiator bars to emit the photons and leads to a resolution per detector of 30 - 40 ps .",
    "several detectors are thus needed to achieve the wanted resolution .",
    "the advantage of such detectors is that it can have a couple of mm space resolution and the inconvenient is the smaller number of photoelectrons produced",

    "will also allow to measure photon induced processes , and to study the @xmath274 coupling in @xmath7 pair production .",
    "the link of the diffractive data with saturation effects which we also discussed is an interesting and promising issue for the future and could lead to a global unified view of the proton .    to summarize ,",
    "the vision of the proton we have at present was definitely improved with the recent data from hera and tevatron but still suffers from large uncertainties at low or high @xmath2 , with significant impact on lhc plysics .",
    "no doubt that the understanding of the proton structure will be further improved at lhc , and new observables less sensitive to pdf uncertainties can be used to disantangle in a better way the pdf effects from the ones due to new physics .",
    "diffractive events still deserve to be explained via a unified understanding of the proton structure and it might be that saturation physics will help us achieving this goal . finally , the rich pdf and diffractive program at lhc will definitely lead to new unforeseen insights of the proton .",
    "we thank r. peschanski for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
