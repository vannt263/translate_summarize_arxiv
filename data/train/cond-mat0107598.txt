    "<S> the temperature dependence of paramagnetic susceptibility of the superfluid @xmath0he - b in aerogel is found . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have been performed for an arbitrary phase shift of @xmath1-wave scattering in the framework of bcs weak coupling theory and the simplest model of aerogel as an aggregate of homogeneously distributed ordinary impurities . </S>",
    "<S> both limiting cases of the born and unitary scattering can be easily obtained from the general result . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of gapless superfluidity starting at the critical impurity concentration depending on the value of the scattering phase has been demonstrated . while larger than in the bulk liquid the calculated susceptibility of the b - phase in aerogel proves to be conspicuously smaller than that determined experimentally in the high pressure region .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 67.57.pq , 67.57.bc    superfluid @xmath0he is an ideal object for a study of physical properties of a system with non - trivial pairing . in particular , it is interesting to investigate how a superfluid state could be influenced by the presence of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> direct contamination of @xmath0he with any atomic impurities is impossible . </S>",
    "<S> last years instead of this experimentalists use liquid @xmath0he to fill up aerogel which is a matrix of randomly arranged silica filaments of nanometer diameter . commonly used aerogels occupy about 2% of space volume , the rest being taken with liquid helium .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite established decrease of the superfluid transition temperature and the density of the superfluid component of @xmath0he in aerogel . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are related to the scattering of quasiparticles from surface , which suppresses cooper pairing in the @xmath2-state . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding theoretical treatments have been proposed in papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nmr measurements @xcite pointed on the existence of the a - phase of @xmath0he in aerogel in relatively high magnetic fields as well as of the b - phase @xcite in lower fields . </S>",
    "<S> recently , evidence of the phase transition between the a- and b - phases has been demonstrated @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the a - phase as an equal spin pairing state possesses practically the same spin susceptibility as the normal phase . </S>",
    "<S> this property remains intact in the a - phase in aerogel . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the b - phase where all the three spin states of the cooper pairs with the spin projections @xmath3 are equally populated , spin susceptibility is partly suppressed compared to its normal state value . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression in aerogel was experimentally found @xcite to constitute about 45% of the value in the bulk @xmath0he - b .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present article is to calculate spin susceptibility of the @xmath0he - b in aerogel . </S>",
    "<S> we shall work in the framework of bcs weak coupling theory , aerogel being approximated as homogeneously distributed ordinary impurities . at high pressures this model gives values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 roughly by a factor of two larger @xcite , @xcite than those observed experimentally . at the same time , as it was discussed in paper @xcite , at low pressures , when the coherence length is larger than the average pore size , the homogeneous scattering model is more likely to be justified .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion follows from the present derivation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated susceptibility is less suppressed compared to the bulk dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression is less pronounced for larger values of the scattering phase but still even in the unitary limit noticeably larger than the measured suppression of the susceptibility at high pressures @xcite , @xcite .    the calculations presented in the paper have been done for an arbitrary value @xmath6 of the phase shift of @xmath1-wave scattering . both extremes : the born approximation and the unitary limit can be easily obtained from the general result .    </S>",
    "<S> corresponding theory of changes of paramagnetic susceptibility in ordinary superconductors caused by impurities with ordinary , paramagnetic and spin - orbital type of scattering has been developed in the born approximation in paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present theory is not a simple generalization of the cited paper . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that usually to come out of the born approximation in the theory of dirty alloys it is sufficient to substitute the born scattering amplitude by its exact counterpart @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this substitution does not lead to the correct answer for a dirty metal in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the method developed in the present paper does not rely on the substitution .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> after the introduction of the basics of the abrikosov - gorkov theory in the first section , we write down its solution for an arbitrary impurity scattering phase without magnetic field in the second section , where we also establish the region of the existence of gapless superfluidity . then by finding corrections in leading order in magnetic field we arrive at an expression for the susceptibility . in the last section </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss conclusions . </S>"
