    "in order to build a quantum computer , we will probably need to use quantum error correcting codes ( qeccs ) to protect the computational qubits from noisy operations ( see  @xcite for an introduction to quantum error correction ) .",
    "similarly , quantum error correction will help preserve qubits stored in a quantum memory .",
    "another application is to protect quantum data being transmitted over a distance from alice to bob .    for the last application ,",
    "though , a better possibility exists . in an _ entanglement purification protocol _ ( epp )  @xcite , alice prepares a number of epr pairs and transmits half of each to bob over a noisy quantum channel .",
    "alice and bob then make some measurements on their parts of the epr pairs and compare results over a noiseless classical side channel . based on their measurements",
    ", they then perform local quantum operations to their remaining qubits to produce a smaller number of more reliable epr pairs . then , using these epr pairs and the classical side channel , alice teleports her qubits to bob .",
    "if the epp has succeeded , the noise rate in the qubits emerging from the teleportation protocol is much lower than the noise rate in the channel .",
    "if we allow alice to transmit classical information to bob , but bob can not transmit information to alice , the epp is a _ one - way _ epp ( or 1-epp ) .",
    "@xcite showed that 1-epps are equivalent to qeccs : there is a straightforward procedure to convert any qecc to a 1-epp and vice - versa .",
    "these protocols are useful , for instance , to create a quantum memory , in which quantum information is stored for some time before being used .",
    "the decoder has to decode the message using only information stored in the memory , and the encoding can not depend on information about the errors which may be gained during decoding .",
    "thus , the communication is one - way : from the encoder to the decoder .",
    "in contrast , if an epp is used to transmit information between two parties , alice and bob , there is no reason to prevent bob from transmitting classical information to alice .",
    "an epp in which alice and bob both transmit classical information is known as a two - way epp ( or 2-epp ) .",
    "while a back channel does not help for transmitting classical data over a classical noisy channel , the classical back channel _ does _ help in transmitting quantum data over a noisy quantum channel .",
    "2-epps typically tolerate a much higher error rate than 1-epps  @xcite , and in some cases are known to also allow substantially higher data rates even for low error rates  @xcite .",
    "this channel capacity problem is usually considered in the model where errors occur independently on different qubits with some fixed probability , and the goal is to produce a received state with very high fidelity in the asymptotic limit of many transmitted qubits .",
    "if we only wish to transmit a few qubits , it makes more sense to consider a small block code . for qeccs ( and indeed classical error - correcting codes ) , we often consider what is known as the minimum distance scenario , in which we transmit @xmath3 qubits to protect @xmath2 data qubits against up to @xmath4 single - qubit errors during transmission ( or in fact against an arbitrary error which affects @xmath4 qubits ) .",
    "when there are @xmath4 or fewer errors , the decoding procedure leaves us with exactly the correct state on the @xmath2 data qubits .",
    "when there are more than @xmath4 errors , the state can be wrong in arbitrary ways .",
    "we can define the _",
    "minimum distance problem _ for @xmath4 errors as follows :    find a protocol which allows alice to transmit @xmath2 qubits to bob with perfect fidelity .",
    "the protocol may use a quantum channel which transmits @xmath3 qubits and applies the operation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some superoperator acting on @xmath4 of the qubits ( not necessarily the first @xmath4 ) and @xmath9 is the identity on the remaining @xmath10 qubits .",
    "the protocol may use classical side channels , but can not depend on any properties of the quantum channel operation except the fact that it acts nontrivially on at most @xmath4 qubits .",
    "the usual solution to the minimum distance problem is a qecc with distance @xmath11 , which requires no classical side channels .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the minimum distance problem for 2-epps .",
    "alice prepares @xmath3 epr pairs and transmits half of each to bob over the noisy quantum channel .",
    "the channel , as described above , has the property that it applies an arbitrary superoperator affecting at most @xmath4 of the pairs .",
    "then the goal of alice and bob is to produce , by talking back and forth over the classical side channels and performing local operations , at least @xmath2 good epr pairs .",
    "note that , given the promise that there are at most @xmath4 errors , we insist that the protocol _ always _ works : while some of the protocols we present will sometimes produce more than @xmath2 good pairs , we require that they never produce fewer than @xmath2 correct epr pairs .",
    "we also require that the epr pairs produced are precisely correct ( fidelity @xmath12 to perfect epr pairs ) . a 2-epp that achieves this",
    "will then provide a solution to the minimum distance problem via quantum teleportation .",
    "note that for a qecc , the distance encapsulates a number of properties of the code . in particular",
    ", the distance determines the number of errors that can be detected and the number of correctable erasure errors as well as the number of general errors that can be corrected . for a 2-epp",
    ", there does not appear to be any single quantity that encapsulates such a broad set of properties , so 2-epps do not have a `` distance '' in the conventional sense .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basic theory of stabilizer quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite and the relationship between qeccs and 1-epps .    the pauli group @xmath13 is a group consisting of tensor products of the three matrices @xmath14 and the identity @xmath9 with overall phase @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 anticommute with each other ( e.g. , @xmath20 ) and that any two elements of the pauli group either commute or anticommute .",
    "furthermore , the pauli group on @xmath4 qubits is a basis for the space of all matrices corresponding to operators acting on @xmath4 qubits .",
    "a stabilizer @xmath21 is an abelian subgroup of @xmath13 which does not contain @xmath22 or @xmath16 .",
    "let the coding space @xmath23 be the set of states @xmath24 for which @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "suppose the stabilizer @xmath21 has @xmath27 generators @xmath28 .",
    "the error syndrome of @xmath29 is the @xmath27-bit string whose @xmath30th bit is @xmath31 if @xmath32 commutes with @xmath33 and is @xmath12 if @xmath32 anticommutes with @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the set of pauli matrices which have error syndrome @xmath31  i.e. , which commute with the stabilizer .",
    "the motivation for the definition of error syndrome and for using this formalism for defining quantum codes is that if a state @xmath24 is a @xmath35-eigenvector of an operator @xmath36 , and @xmath37 anticommutes with @xmath36 ( @xmath38 ) , then @xmath39 is a @xmath22-eigenvector of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , looking at a simple property of the stabilizer allows us to evaluate the code s ability to detect and correct errors  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : ec ] if there are @xmath3 qubits and the stabilizer @xmath21 has @xmath27 generators , then the coding space @xmath23 has dimension @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the code encodes @xmath41 qubits .",
    "the set of undetectable errors for the code is @xmath42 .",
    "the code corrects any set @xmath43 for which @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the code corrects @xmath4 errors if @xmath42 contains no pauli operations acting on fewer than @xmath46 qubits .",
    "if a stabilizer code corrects a set of errors @xmath47 , and there exist @xmath45 such that @xmath48 but @xmath49 , then the code is said to be _ degenerate _ or _",
    "impure_. otherwise the code is _ non - degenerate _ or _",
    "pure_.    the error correction procedure is simply to measure the eigenvalue of each of the generators of @xmath21 .",
    "( for each generator , the @xmath50 dimensional space of all states on @xmath3 qubits decomposes into a direct sum of two @xmath51 dimensional subspaces , one consisting of all eigenvectors of the operator with eigenvalue 1 , the other consisting of all eigenvectors with eigenvalue -1 .",
    "`` measuring the eigenvalue '' means that we measure if the state belongs to the first or the second of these subspaces , in the process projecting the state onto the appropriate subspace . )",
    "the correct state has eigenvalue @xmath35 , but if error @xmath32 has occurred , the actual eigenvalue is @xmath22 .",
    "this gives us the error syndrome , and from there we can deduce the error and correct it . for a non - degenerate code ,",
    "all the error syndromes are distinct , so the error syndrome uniquely identifies the error .",
    "the errors are not uniquely identified for a degenerate code , but it does not matter , because errors which have the same error syndrome act exactly the same way on encoded states .",
    "this suggests how we can perform an epp based on any stabilizer qecc .",
    "alice prepares a number of epr pairs @xmath52 , and sends the second half to bob .",
    "if there are no errors in the channel , alice , when she measures any pauli operator @xmath36 on her side , will get a predictable measurement result relative to bob s when he measures the same @xmath36 on his side .",
    "in particular , alice and bob can each measure the generators of a stabilizer @xmath21 on their own side . in the absence of errors",
    ", they should get the same measurement result for any generator with an even number of @xmath18s , and the opposite measurement result for any generator with an odd number of @xmath18s .",
    "is a @xmath35 eigenstate of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , but a @xmath22 eigenstate of @xmath55 . ]",
    "that is , if alice s measurement results form the vector @xmath56 and bob s measurement results form the vector @xmath57 , then @xmath58 , where the @xmath59th bit of @xmath60 is the parity of the number of @xmath18s in the @xmath59th generator of @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the channel has performed a pauli error @xmath32 , they will get different results : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is precisely the error syndrome of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "thus , if alice sends her measurement results to bob , bob can compare alice s results to his , deduce the error syndrome of @xmath32 , and correct it just as if he were using a quantum error - correcting code .",
    "alice and bob have measured @xmath63 qubits , destroying the entanglement of @xmath27 pairs , but @xmath64 pairs are left over .",
    "note that the remaining entanglement will actually be distributed across many or all of the original @xmath3 pairs , so alice and bob must perform a decoding operation to extract it .",
    "alice and bob have each projected their state onto a codeword of the qecc with stabilizer @xmath21 with some known syndrome @xmath56 ( alice s measurement results ) , and must therefore perform the decoding operation for @xmath21 to get back the @xmath2 epr pairs they desire .",
    "qeccs and epps correct more general errors than just pauli errors because of the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , if a code ( or epp ) corrects a set of errors @xmath65 , it also corrects any errors in the linear span of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , a code or epp which corrects pauli errors on up to @xmath4 qubits actually corrects _ any _ error affecting up to @xmath4 qubits  @xcite , and thus provides a solution to the minimum distance problem .",
    "along the same lines , we can construct a class of 2-epps as adaptive stabilizer codes .",
    "the model is as follows .",
    "alice and bob measure @xmath27 commuting pauli operators , one by one . after measuring each operator , they both send their measurement results to each other",
    ". then they xor the results , obtaining one bit of the error syndrome .",
    "the @xmath66 operator can depend on the results obtained in the first @xmath30 measurements but has to commute with all the previously measured operators .",
    "the end result is that alice and bob have measured the generators of one stabilizer code out of a larger family . the choice of which code , however , depended on the results of early measurements . to specify a 2-epp",
    ", we therefore need to describe a rule for choosing operators to measure based on the outcomes of previous measurements .",
    "note that the procedure is a 2-epp and not a 1-epp because alice needs to know bob s results before she knows which operators to measure .",
    "( this type of epp has been called a _ stabilizer _ epp , and is characterized more precisely in definition 4 of  @xcite . )    at the end of protocol , alice and bob apply local unitary transformations @xmath67 and @xmath68 which may depend on the results of the measurements during the protocol .",
    "they succeed if , for any error on at most @xmath4 epr pairs , the protocol produces @xmath2 perfect epr pairs .      as the first example , consider the following 2-epp which produces 2 good epr pairs from 6 epr pairs in the presence of 1 error .",
    "( there is no qecc which can do this for qubits  @xcite . )",
    "alice and bob measure @xmath69 on the first four pairs .",
    "these two operators generate the stabilizer for a code detecting an arbitrary single error  any single - qubit pauli operator will be outside @xmath34 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    * they detect an error ( get a non - zero error syndrome ) . in this case",
    ", they know there is an error in the first four pairs , and therefore none in the last two , since there is a maximum of one error .",
    "they therefore discard all of the first four pairs , and keep the remaining two . *",
    "they detect no error ( zero error syndrome ) . since there is again a maximum of one error , and they would have detected any single error on the first four pairs , they know the first four pairs must be correct .",
    "they used up two pairs for the measurement , but they still have two left . in this case",
    ", the two pairs that are left do not directly correspond to any of the original four pairs . instead",
    ", alice and bob must each perform a local circuit equal to the decoding operation for the four - qubit qecc with the appropriate syndrome .",
    "if there was no error on the four pairs at the beginning , then the decoding procedure gives alice and bob two pairs with no errors .",
    "it may at first appear that this 2-epp falls slightly outside the adaptive stabilizer code construction , as it involves discarding unwanted pairs .",
    "however , it can easily be rewritten as a degenerate adaptive stabilizer code , simply by measuring a complete set of operators for the discarded pairs .",
    "for instance , if alice and bob detect an error with the first two measurements , they then also measure @xmath70 and @xmath71 on the first four pairs .",
    "next , we present a 2-epp that produces @xmath72 good epr pairs from @xmath73 pairs if there is up to one error .",
    "this should be compared with the best family of 1-error - correcting qeccs known , which protect @xmath74 qubits with @xmath75 qubits if there is up to one error  @xcite .",
    "alice and bob start by measuring @xmath76 .",
    "if they detect an error , they know that there is a @xmath18 or @xmath19 error . then , they localize it by binary search , in @xmath77 steps . before the @xmath78 localization step ,",
    "alice and bob have a set @xmath79 of @xmath80 or @xmath81 candidate epr pairs .",
    "they have measured the product of @xmath17 on this set and they have detected an error in it .",
    "if @xmath82 , they have also measured @xmath83 pauli operators on pairs not in @xmath79 . in the @xmath78 localization step , alice and bob divide @xmath79 into sets @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one containing @xmath86 epr pairs and the other containing either @xmath86 or @xmath87 pairs .",
    "then , they measure the product of @xmath17 operators over all pairs in @xmath84 . together with the previous measurement ( the product of @xmath17 over @xmath79 ) , this is equivalent to measuring the product of @xmath17 in @xmath84 and the product of @xmath17 in @xmath85 . if there is an error in @xmath84 , then alice and bob set @xmath88",
    "otherwise , @xmath89 .",
    "after @xmath77 such steps , alice and bob have a set @xmath90 consisting of 1 or 2 epr pairs , they have measured the product of @xmath17 for @xmath91 and they know that @xmath91 contains a damaged epr pair .",
    "then , alice and bob discard pairs in @xmath91 .",
    "the other @xmath92 or @xmath93 pairs are good and only @xmath77 of them have been measured .",
    "( altogether , alice and bob have measured @xmath94 pairs but one of those measurements has been on discarded pairs only . ) therefore , they have at least @xmath95 good epr pairs .    the second case is if the first measurement ( product of @xmath17 on all epr pairs ) detects no error .",
    "then , there is either no error at all or an @xmath17 error on one of @xmath96 epr pairs .",
    "this means that there are @xmath97 possibilities for error . with @xmath98",
    "more measurements , alice and bob can distinguish which one of those has happened . to do that , they number the epr pairs by numbers @xmath99 .",
    "each of those numbers can be written in binary with @xmath98 digits .",
    "alice and bob measure the product of @xmath19 operators for all epr pairs whose numbers have the first digit equal to 0 , the product of @xmath19 operators for all epr pairs whose numbers have the second digit equal to 0 , etc .",
    "that is , they measure the parity checks for the hamming code of length @xmath100 .",
    "if there is an @xmath17 error on the @xmath78 epr pair , each measurement gives us one bit of @xmath30 ( the bit is 0 if the corresponding measurement detects an error and 1 if it does not detect an error ) .",
    "all @xmath98 measurements together uniquely determine @xmath30 .",
    "it remains to see what happens if there is no error .",
    "then no measurement detects error , implying that either there is no error or the error is in the location that has 1 in every bit .",
    "if the location has all @xmath98 bits equal to 1 , its number must be @xmath73 but alice and bob do not have an epr pair numbered @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , they know for certain that there has been no error .",
    "after that , alice and bob know the type of error and its location and they correct it .",
    "they have destroyed @xmath101 epr pairs .",
    "therefore , alice and bob again have @xmath95 good epr pairs remaining .",
    "we illustrate the protocol with two examples for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the first is if there is a @xmath18 error on the @xmath105 pair .",
    "then , the operators that alice and bob measure are : @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 the first two reveal an error , the third does not .",
    "alice and bob conclude that either the @xmath105 or the @xmath109 pair has a @xmath18 or @xmath19 error .",
    "they discard these two pairs .",
    "the last two measurements are equivalent to @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , one measurement has been on the discarded pairs .",
    "therefore , out of the remaining 5 pairs , 2 have been measured .",
    "they have 3 good epr pairs .    in the second example",
    ", there is an @xmath17 error on the @xmath112 pair . in this case ,",
    "alice and bob measure @xmath106 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 the first two measurements detect no error .",
    "the third and the fourth detect an error .",
    "after that , alice and bob know that there is an @xmath17 error on the @xmath112 pair and correct it .",
    "they have used 4 out of 7 pairs and have 3 good pairs remaining .",
    "a more dramatic example is a 2-epp which produces at least 1 good epr pair from 9 epr pairs when there are up to 2 errors .",
    "this is better than the quantum hamming bound , which says that the number of errors times the number of encoded basis states is at most the dimension of the overall hilbert space : @xmath116 for @xmath117 errors and @xmath118 , this equation would suggest @xmath119 . the six - pair and @xmath73 pair 2-epps above",
    "also exceed the quantum hamming bound for @xmath120 .",
    "it is not known in general whether the quantum hamming bound limits all qeccs , since it could potentially be violated by a degenerate code , for which distinct errors @xmath37 and @xmath121 have the same error syndrome but act the same way on codewords ( i.e. , @xmath48 for a degenerate stabilizer code ) .",
    "however , no known qeccs exceed the quantum hamming bound , and in fact for @xmath117 , linear programming bounds  @xcite show that @xmath122 , so our 2-epp beats the best qecc by two epr pairs .",
    "the particular 2-epp we present is based on the four - qubit error - detecting code  ( [ eqn:4qubit ] ) and the five - qubit error - correcting code with stabilizer generators @xmath123 the five - qubit code can correct one error or detect two errors . for the 9-pair epp , alice and bob measure the generators of the five - qubit code on the first five pairs , and the generators of the four - qubit code on the last four pairs .",
    "they first use the results of both measurements to detect errors .",
    "we then have the following cases :    * they detect an error on the last four pairs . in that case",
    ", there can be at most one error on the first five pairs , so they can use the five - qubit code to correct the error , producing one good pair .",
    "they discard the last four pairs , leaving them with one good pair overall .",
    "* they detect an error on the first five pairs but none on the last four pairs . in that case",
    ", there is at least one error on the first five pairs , so there could be at most one on the last four .",
    "if there had been one error on the last four , they would have detected it , so alice and bob know the last four pairs are safe .",
    "they discard the first five pairs ( which could contain two errors ) , and extract the two remaining pairs from the last four . in this case ,",
    "they are left with two good pairs . *",
    "they detect no errors on either set of pairs .",
    "if there had been any errors ( one or two ) on the first five pairs , they would have detected them .",
    "therefore , any errors must be on the last four pairs .",
    "it is possible , however , that two errors on the last four pairs would go undetected .",
    "they discard the last four pairs , and extract the one remaining pair from the first five pairs ; there is no need for error correction .",
    "they are left with one good pair .",
    "we can also create epps that violate the quantum singleton bound  @xcite @xmath124 this bound applies to degenerate quantum codes as well as nondegenerate ones , and shows , for instance , that the smallest qecc to correct one error has 5 qubits .",
    "the construction we present requires using registers with dimension greater than two ; qutrits will suffice .",
    "the quantum singleton bound also applies to higher - dimensional codes , so there is no qecc encoding 1 qutrit in 4 and correcting one error . in contrast , we present a 2-epp that corrects one error out of only 4 pairs",
    ".    we can generalize the stabilizer formalism to a higher dimension @xmath125 by replacing the qubit pauli group with the group generated by tensor products of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where addition is modulo @xmath125 , and @xmath128  @xcite .",

    "the same basic principle allows us to create stabilizer codes in higher dimensions : if @xmath133 and @xmath134 , then @xmath135 .",
    "we can therefore again create codes as the joint @xmath35-eigenspace of elements of an abelian subgroup of the pauli group , and the pauli errors it detects will again be all operators outside @xmath42 .    in particular",

    "] we can then create a 2-epp correcting 1 error out of 4 qutrit epr pairs .",
    "alice and bob measure the generators of this error - detecting code on the first three pairs .",
    "if they detect an error , they keep the fourth pair and discard the first three .",
    "otherwise , they discard the last pair and extract the one remaining pair from the first three .",
    "either way , they end up with one reliable epr pair out of the original four .",
    "to construct the above examples of 2-epps , we split up the epr pairs and used error detection techniques to discard noisy pairs .",

    ", when alice and bob measure @xmath36 , the new set of possible errors will be either @xmath147 or @xmath148 , depending on the measurement result . in the worst case , it will be the larger of these two sets , so our goal is to show that @xmath149 is not much larger than @xmath150 .",
    "alice and bob repeat this process until the set of possible errors has shrunk to a single operator , at which point they know the error and can correct it . the number of generators they must add to the stabilizer to do this is @xmath143 , and we wish to show that in the worst case , @xmath143 is not much larger than @xmath151.\\ ] ]    for any @xmath45 , we say @xmath152 _ separates _ the pair @xmath153 iff @xmath154 , so @xmath155 and @xmath156 or vice - versa .",
    "in fact , precisely half of the elements @xmath157 separate any pair @xmath158 , but no element of @xmath21 does ( since @xmath37 and @xmath121 have the same error syndrome relative to @xmath21 ) .",
    "if @xmath159 , then @xmath160 , so each pair @xmath158 is separated by @xmath161 elements of @xmath42 .",
    "there are @xmath162 pairs total , so collectively , the elements of @xmath42 separate @xmath163 pairs . on average , then , the elements of @xmath42 separate @xmath164 pairs each . in particular , there exists @xmath165 that separates at least this many pairs .",
    "now , @xmath36 has the sets @xmath147 , @xmath148 and separates @xmath166 .",
    "thus , @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath169 , we find @xmath170 , and since @xmath98 is an integer , @xmath171 .    if we set @xmath172 , then we find @xmath173 or @xmath174    using ( [ eqn : diff ] ) repeatedly , and bearing in mind that @xmath98 must always be an integer , we can find the number of steps necessary to bring any particular initial value of @xmath175 down to @xmath12 . at any stage ,",
    "given @xmath47 , choosing another stabilizer generator by the above rule gives us a new set @xmath176 of possible errors , with @xmath177    we can define an integer sequence @xmath178 such that @xmath179 and @xmath178 is the largest integer such that @xmath180 thus , whenever @xmath181 , it follows that @xmath182 .",
    "we can therefore reduce the set of possible errors to @xmath12 in at most @xmath30 steps .",
    "below we give @xmath178 for small values of @xmath30 : @xmath183    for larger values of @xmath30 , we note that @xmath184 if @xmath185 then @xmath186 let @xmath187 , and let @xmath188 ( since @xmath189 ) .",
    "then for @xmath190 , @xmath191 by induction : @xmath192.\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath193 for @xmath194 , so for @xmath190 , @xmath195 . therefore ,",
    "when @xmath196 , we can reduce the set of possible errors to @xmath12 in at most @xmath197 steps , proving the theorem .    note that this technique of narrowing down the set of possible errors fails if we try to apply it to qeccs . while we can indeed choose a single stabilizer generator @xmath198 which separates @xmath47 into approximately equal sets @xmath199 , @xmath200 , choosing the second generator @xmath201 is more difficult . for 2-epps , we need only consider one of the two sets @xmath199 , @xmath200 , whichever is indicated by the first measurement . for a qecc ,",
    "we do not know which set will be selected , so the second generator @xmath201 must divide both of these sets approximately in half .",
    "the problem compounds at later steps , as the third generator chosen must simultaneously divide up four sets of possible errors , and the @xmath78 generator must be chosen to evenly divide up @xmath202 different sets of possible errors all at once .",
    "clearly this is substantially more difficult than splitting just a single set in half , and results in a significantly reduced efficiency for the qecc compared to a 2-epp .",
    "we have considered the minimum distance scenario for 2-epps and given a number of examples of 2-epps that are more efficient than any qecc .",
    "the small block epps we present might be useful for quantum communication in near - future scenarios .",
    "the asymptotic construction we give of 2-epps is not very practical , since finding the optimal set of measurements appears to be a computationally difficult task . for practical applications of 2-epps ,",
    "we want the equivalent of an efficient decoding algorithm  namely , an efficient algorithm to tell us what to measure next , and , once all measurements are complete , to tell us how to correct the state .    one way to find such epps might be to consider qeccs with good list - decoding algorithms . since classical error - correcting codes can be substantially more efficient when we only demand list decoding rather than minimum distance decoding  @xcite , it seems very likely that qeccs would have the same property . then we might be able to convert the list - decoded qecc to a minimum - distance 2-epp by choosing just a few additional generators to narrow down the short list of possible errors to a single error .",
