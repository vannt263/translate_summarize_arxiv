    "aperiodic crystals are long - range ordered structures whose diffraction patterns are made of bragg peaks . the difference with respect to normal crystals is that they are not periodic and one needs @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the dimension of the internal space ) basis vectors to index the positions of peaks in reciprocal space :    @xmath3    this property has been exploited in crystallography by embedding the structure in a superspace crystal of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "atomic positions are the intersections between the d - dimensional atomic surfaces and the 3-dimensional physical space . for periodic crystals ,",
    "the floquet - bloch theory reduces the @xmath5 dimensional eigenvector problem of lattice modes ( @xmath6 is the number of atoms ) to a @xmath7 dimensional problem ( @xmath8 being the number of atoms inside the unit cell ) .",
    "the similar approach can be used for aperiodic crystals , but in this case the number of equations is not reduced ; because of incommensurability @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , as we show in this paper , superspace concepts lead to important simplifications in the description of modes , that can be used in the analysis of inelastic neutron scattering experiments .    at present , three classes of aperiodic crystals are known : incommensurate modulated crystals , incommensurate composites and quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "atomic surfaces are discontinuous for quasicrystals , but they can be continuous for modulated crystals and for composites .",
    "the borders between the three classes are not so clear as one may think .",
    "the classification difficulties between modulated and composites crystals are notorious .",
    "if discontinuous atomic surfaces and occupational modulations are allowed @xcite , any modulated structure can be seen as a composite one and vice - versa .",
    "the choice can be particularly difficult in compounds with a complex structure .",
    "for instance , recent structural neutron investigations of bi-2212 superconductors @xcite emphasize the difficulty of deciding whether these materials should be called composite or modulated .",
    "a natural question arises .",
    "can dynamics as probed by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite give an answer to this classification problem ?    in order to answer this question we need to know the typical dynamical responses of different aperiodic crystals .",
    "several simplified model systems will be investigated , hoping that more complex systems behave in resemblance to one of these .",
    "of course , it is also possible that compounds that structurally are at the border between the three classes of aperiodic crystals have also special dynamical properties , at the border between the ones studied here , in which case the classification problem could be really intractable .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the linear ( small amplitude ) excitations of displacively modulated and composite crystals .",
    "the case of occupational modulations and that of non - linear ( large amplitude ) excitations will be studied elsewhere .",

    "the n - dimensional superspace picture suggests that aperiodic crystals have n branches of propagating hydrodynamic modes .",
    "only three of those are true goldstone modes , associated to the broken translation symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "these three branches are the general acoustic phonons , present in any solid .",
    "the other @xmath10 branches are called phasons because they are associated to the broken `` phase '' symmetry of the ground states manifold ( which is not a symmetry of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "the hydrodynamics of composite aperiodic crystals has already been the object of several theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "although they offer rather complete results ( including damping ) these papers suffer from their generality and from the use of various phenomenological parameters .",
    "it is difficult to extract from them the consequences of incommensurability on dynamics and to find the answers to simple ( yet important ) questions such as which is the contribution of each mode to the neutron inelastic scattered intensity and which are the regions in the reciprocal space where these contributions are most intense .",
    "modes observability is not only determined by the ( integrated ) intensity of the peaks , but also by the line shape .",
    "the hotly debated problem of damping , whether intrinsic as mode - mode coupling @xcite or extrinsic via coupling to defects , is left out from our discussion .",
    "the superspace picture suggests that there is a tight connection between structure and dynamics . from the very",
    "beginning of our paper we exploit this connection and our purpose is to find a small set of quantities that can be easily interpreted theoretically and measured experimentally , and that facilitate the classification of aperiodic crystals from the point of view of their dynamical properties .",

    "we have shown that these are different for modulated and composite crystals .",

    "although the numerical simulations using the diffour model showed only negligible phason / phonon coupling , the theoretical arguments that we employed do not exclude the possibility of a phason / phonon coupling far from the c - ic transition , for instance in the non - analytic regime . in composites , various inner polarizations are possible .",
    "let us see how the above theoretical considerations can be used to interpret available experimental results on structure and dynamics of incommensurate modulated and composite crystals .",
    "incommensurate modulated crystals have been studied rather intensively and there are some well characterized model systems @xcite .    for the incommensurate compound @xmath212 @xcite the modulation function is analytic , almost sinusoidal ( only first order satellites are visible ) . in this case",
    "there is no difficulty to identify the main reflections and the classification task is trivial .",
    "a gapless phason was observed by inelastic neutron scattering close to the first order satellite @xmath213 of the main bragg @xmath214 . despite",
    "that the intensity of the studied satellite reflection is strong , the acoustical phonon branches were measured only around the main reflections .    in the phase iii of biphenyl",
    "@xcite one can observe strong satellites , up to order 3 in neutron scattering , suggesting a non - analytic ( soliton ) regime or ( which is equivalent ) a higher - order commensurate phase .",
    "coherent inelastic neutron scattering scans around a first - order satellite have revealed a frequency gap in the phason branch at @xmath174 .",
    "the presence of a @xmath69 gap that would be expected in the non - analytic regime has not been detected , perhaps because of the instrumental resolution and the heavy damping of these excitations .",
    "there are many structures that can be named `` composites '' .",
    "still , a precise classification is not established yet .",
    "the best studied composite system is the mercury chains compound @xmath215 with @xmath216 @xcite . in this case",
    "there is no doubt that the structure is composite , being made of two weakly interacting subsystems .",
    "the tetrahedra of @xmath217 form the host tetragonal subsystem .",
    "there are two mercury subsystems in two orthogonal sets of channels of the host , running along the equivalent incommensurate a and b axes of the tetragonal system . at room temperature",
    "the host main bragg peaks are easily recognizable at positions @xmath218 and mercury chains produce diffuse thin sheets at @xmath219 orthogonal to @xmath220 and at @xmath221 orthogonal to @xmath222 . near main bragg peaks of the host and along the incommensurability direction @xmath223 , acoustical longitudinal modes with a speed @xmath224 were measured . near mercury chain diffuse sheets and along the same direction",
    "a gapless longitudinal branch was measured with a very different speed @xmath225 . according to our discussion",
    "this suggests the existence of two acoustic - like modes with inner polarization parameters @xmath226 and @xmath200 , concentrated on the host and on the mercury chains , respectively .",
    "this picture is consistent with the weak inter - subsystem coupling and the large difference between slopes of the dispersion curves ( figs.[fig : modes],[fig : branch ] ) .",
    "the alkane / urea inclusion compounds @xcite are also guest / host type composites with two easily recognizable subsystems .",
    "at all studied temperatures , guest chains ( alkane ) have only 1d order and produce diffuse sheets , like in the case of mercury chains , but the alkane modulation is found to be strongly non - harmonic @xcite .",
    "there are no complete studies of dynamics for this compound , nevertheless special features of the longitudinal phonons along the incommensurability direction were observed near main bragg reflections of the host by neutron scattering @xcite and confirmed by brillouin scattering @xcite .",
    "these phonons have unusually large damping ( approx .",
    "400 ghz , independent of @xmath62 @xcite ) compared to the other acoustical phonons ( damping scaling like @xmath227 ) that could be explained by a sliding character ( finite @xmath0 , phason / phonon coupling ) . although this was not studied in this paper , some authors @xcite suggest that damping and sliding are connected via internal friction .",
    "this internal friction can have an intrinsic origin ( occurring for large relative velocities @xcite ) or an extrinsic one ( due to defects ) .",
    "the case of @xmath228 lamellar superconductor is more complex because there is no clear separation of the subsystems and the structural classification is still controversial @xcite .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering @xcite showed the presence of two longitudinal acoustical branches close to two strong reflections and along the incommensurability direction .",
    "the slopes of the dispersion curves are @xmath229 and their intensities do not change when one passes from one reflection to another . according to eqs.[eq : rap1],[eq : tk],[eq : rap2 ] @xmath230 irrespective of the type of structure , hence @xmath231 should be close to 1 for both acoustical branches .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "one could not speak of a modulated structure , because this contradicts eq.[eq : obeta1 ] .",
    "if one of the modes is the acoustical phonon ( @xmath234 ) then in modulated crystals the other mode must be the phason ( @xmath235 ) being thus invisible close to main bragg peaks ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was assumed that the structure is composite and that the two reflections are the main bragg peaks @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the intensity ratios are compatible with eq.[eq : obeta2 ] and can be explained by considering that one of the longitudinal modes is the acoustical phonon ( @xmath199 ) and that the second is the phason ( @xmath238 ( this was computed considering that the densities for the subsystems @xmath239 and @xmath240 are @xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively ) . for both the above inner polarizations the dsf / sf ratio is not changing between the @xmath153 and the @xmath154 bragg reflections ( fig.[fig : ratio]b ) ) . to conclude",
    ", dynamics suggests that the superconductor is composite , but the modes are non - concentrated , which is different from the case of mercury chains compounds .",
    "this situation is reproduced by the dcm model in the rather special situation when @xmath243 ( fig.[fig : equaldcm ] ) . before deciding which is really the case ,",
    "further study is needed in order to check how the interaction details ( range and type of the inter - chain potential ) and the dimensionality ( dcm generalizations to 2d , at least ) influence the inner polarization .",
    "referring now to the regime , some of the modulation functions used in the structure refinement have large amplitudes and are non - analytic ( in particular an occupational modulation is introduced for the oxygen atoms in the @xmath244 layer of the second subsystem ) , while other modulation functions could be analytic .",
    "one may thus think of a situation when the phason gap is below the experimental resolution of 10 ghz . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : dcm ] , this hypothesis could also explain the observed discrepancy between the ultrasound measurement of the speed of sound ( @xmath245 ) and the slope of the neutron dispersion curves .",
    "the dynamics of spin ladder compounds @xmath246 @xcite has been very recently investigated @xcite . again",
    "two low frequency longitudinal modes ( along the incommensurability direction)were observed close to a main bragg peak of each subsystem @xmath247 ( chains ) and @xmath248 ( ladders ) .",
    "one mode is acoustic - like ( no gap ) , the other has a gap of @xmath249 ( for @xmath250 ) and can propagate also transversally .",
    "interestingly enough , when the latter propagates longitudinally it looses intensity very rapidly with @xmath62 . because of the gap",
    ", the mode at low frequencies should be the acoustical phonon .",
    "the loss of intensity with @xmath62 of the second mode ( the phason ) suggests that this one tends to become a sliding mode concentrated on one of the subsystem when @xmath62 is increasing , like in fig.[fig : branch ] .",
    "the orthogonality conditions impose that the acoustical phonon should also change character when @xmath62 increases , concentrating on the other subsystem .",
    "our theory predicts that the observation ( not yet performed ) of a bragg peak belonging to the other subsystem could reveal an opposite behavior of intensity of the acoustical phonon ( this will increase with @xmath62 , see fig.[fig : branch ] , non - analytic regime , ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) main bragg peaks ) .",
    "of course , a more cautious analysis should also include damping effects .",
    "we emphasized the utility of the concept of inner polarization in the description of low frequency excitations in composite and in modulated aperiodic crystals .",
    "this concept has a meaning for long wavelengths in the analytic and even weakly non - analytic dynamical regime , generally for small modulation amplitudes .",
    "the inner polarization is related to internal degrees of freedom of the aperiodic crystals and should not be looked at as the direction of atom displacements ( this is the physical polarization ) .",
    "modes having different inner polarizations differ by the amplitude of rapid oscillations added to a uniform overall displacement in modulated crystals and also by the `` sliding '' character and the relative participation of the subsystems in composites .",
    "the inner polarization can be defined for modes that do not change the shape of the superspace atomic surfaces .",
    "the possible values of the inner polarization parameter @xmath0 are different in composites and modulated crystals .    in modulated crystals , close to the c - ic transition",
    "the phason and the acoustical phonon should be uncoupled .    in composites , the phason and the acoustical phonon",
    "can be coupled .",
    "we called `` sliding - modes '' all the modes with @xmath251 ( the only exception is the acoustical phonon ) because they produce a relative shift of the mass centres of the subsystems .",
    "the pure phason is a special sliding mode , the only one that conserves the overall mass centre .",
    "one can distinguish two extreme types of dynamics in composites : concentrated modes ( two sliding modes with @xmath252 , involving each one displacements of a single subsystem ) and non - concentrated modes ( the acoustical phonon , the pure phason or other sliding modes involving both subsystems ) .",
    "crossover is possible from one type of dynamics to another .",
    "the variation of the inner polarization and of the participation ratio with the wave vector @xmath62 is a different phenomenon from the crossover between diffusive and propagating modes discussed in @xcite .",
    "the inner polarization of the modes influences the neutron inelastic scattering . for modulated structures",
    "the pure phonon is visible near all main bragg reflection and satellites , but the phason is visible only near satellites . for composites ,",
    "the `` concentrated '' modes are visible only near main bragg reflections of the subsystem on which they are concentrated , or near satellites , `` non - concentrated '' modes are visible near both types of main bragg reflections and also near satellites .    the above properties can be used to distinguish between modulated structures and composites and also between the two extreme types of dynamics in composites .",
    "more information could be ( at least in principle ) extracted by an investigation of the satellites .",
    "the inner polarization can be determined from the ratio between the dynamical structure factor and the statical structure factor at various reflections . of course , for more precision one has to consider also the neglected factor @xmath253 $ ] in the @xmath113 and the effect of damping on the line shape .    in experiments ,",
    "it is important to know for a given mode the set of satellites where this is visible .",
    "a pure phonon scatters strongly near strong satellites . for modulated structures",
    "the empirical observation is that the same thing is true for the phason .",
    "this can by justified by multiplying eq.[eq : rap1 ] for @xmath254 and @xmath255 $ ] where @xmath256 .",
    "we get @xmath257 $ ] , where @xmath258 is the intensity scattered by the phason .",
    "if @xmath259 decreases with @xmath260 quicker than @xmath261 , then the first order satellites @xmath262 are the most intense and correspond to the strongest phason inelastic scattering . for composites , from eq.[eq : rap2 ] we get :    * for @xmath57 ( sliding mode concentrated on the second subsystem ) @xmath257 $ ] . * for @xmath55 ( sliding mode concentrated on the first subsystem ) @xmath263 ( pure phason , hence non - concentrated ) @xmath264 $ ] .",
    "we face here a more complex situation . in composites",
    ", one can have significant values of the @xmath177 for high values of @xmath137 or @xmath260 for satellites of the type @xmath265 or @xmath266 ( which are first order for the second and the first subsystem , respectively ) .",
    "even if the @xmath144 satellite could be statically more intense , the scattered intensity may be stronger for @xmath265 ( for @xmath57 ) or for @xmath266 ( for @xmath55 ) .",
    "furthermore , for non - concentrated sliding modes , there is an extinction rule : the mode will be invisible close to satellites satisfying @xmath267 ( in the dcm model with @xmath139 this becomes @xmath268 ) .",
    "this type of extinction has been previously reported in theoretical models @xcite .",
    "thus , sliding modes may not give the strongest inelastic scattering near the strongest satellites .",
    "in a given practical situation one should use eq.[eq : rap2 ] together with the measured values of @xmath269 in order to calculate @xmath270 and to find out where this is the strongest .    from our discussion of the inner polarization",
    "it becomes clear that sentences of the type `` this is the phonon mode and this is the phason ( or sliding ) mode '' referring to acoustic - like modes in composites are at least incomplete .",
    "sliding modes may have various inner polarizations and the pure phonon may simply not exist when there are two sliding modes .",
