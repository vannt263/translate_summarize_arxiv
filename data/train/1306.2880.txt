    "the problem of the pairing interaction in a fermi system , like e.g. an atomic nucleus , has been dealt with long time ago in the case of @xmath3 pairs living in a single level and the solution is well - known .    instead , the case of @xmath3 pairs distributed over a set of @xmath4 levels , each one with a pair degeneracy @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 , is treated with the richardson s equations @xcite ( in short re ) , to be described below , but no explicit solution can be given in a closed form : hence for a finite system one has to resort to numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the re , assuming that @xmath3 pairs are distributed , in the absence of interaction , over @xmath4 levels , read @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath0 being the strength of the interaction . the @xmath9 , namely the unknowns",
    ", are sometimes viewed as the energies of the single ( @xmath10 ) pairs , although this statement is questionable : in fact they have no direct physical meaning and could be complex .",
    "the true observable , namely the energy of the system in a given state , in the richardson framework turns out to be @xmath11 and is of course real . in the @xmath3 pairs",
    "are set up by two fermions in time reversal states coupled to zero momentum or angular momentum .",
    "the space of the parameters in the pairing problem is wide , being generated by the set of the unperturbed s.p.e .",
    "( single particle energies ) @xmath12 , by their pair degeneracies @xmath13 and by the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "we remind that @xmath4 can be of the order of , say , 10 or less in the nuclear case , but is of the order of the avogadro number in the case of a band in a metal .    in the strong coupling limit",
    ", however , the dependence upon the whole set of parameters occurs only through some simple combination of them .",
    "actually here the re reduce to a system of equations essentially parameter - free , whose solutions , namely the @xmath9 , can be obtained by exploiting a scaling property , hence an analytic solution for the total energy can be given , although not in a closed form , but as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath0 .",
    "this topic has been addressed in some recent papers  @xcite in the context of solid state physics ( actually superconducting metallic grains ) where a major simplification occurs since the unperturbed levels are assumed to be equally spaced ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) and to host only one pair ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the case of nuclear physics requires an extension of this approach since the nuclear levels are distributed inside a major shell with various energies and degeneracies .",
    "the pairing problem for @xmath3 pairs living in any number of degenerate levels has been recently addressed in the framework of pseudodeformed quasispin @xmath17 algebra  @xcite and an exact solution has been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite for an orbit - dependent interaction in the special case of two nondegenerate energy levels , but an analytic solution to the general problem is not presently available .",
    "as we shall see , however , in the strong coupling limit the pairing energy depends only upon the statistical properties of the level distribution .    in this paper",
    "we propose a further derivation of the strong coupling expansion which , extending the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , applies not only to the ground state , but to the excited states energies as well and neatly displays in its coefficients the renormalization of the statistical moments of the levels distribution , of the strength of the interaction and of the number of pairs prevented to take an active part into the dynamics induced by the interaction with the trapped pairs .",
    "moreover , and importantly , we succeed as in ref.@xcite in yielding analytic expressions for the `` pair energies '' @xmath9 .",
    "this we do in sections 2 and 3 . in section 4 and 5",
    "we address a specific nuclear problem to illustrate how the method works and in section 6 we compare our results with the exact numerical solution of the re .",
    "let us first define the `` strong coupling limit '' . as already discussed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we introduce the average @xmath18 and the variance @xmath19 with @xmath20 of the levels distribution .",
    "then , since @xmath21 is an intrinsically irrelevant parameter , as it depends upon the choice of the zero point of the energy , we safely assume @xmath22 . thus the two energy scales entering into the pairing problem will be set by @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "when the condition @xmath24 is met , then the single particle levels ( s.p.l . ) span a very narrow energy range and the well - known solution @xmath25 is expected to be a very good approximation ( @xmath26 denotes the seniority ) .",
    "it was found in @xcite that a convenient expansion parameter is @xmath27 the strong coupling limit corresponding to @xmath28    it is known that in the strong coupling limit for a given state some of the @xmath9 are large ( those contributing to the collectivity of the state ) and of the order of @xmath0 , while the others remain trapped between the unperturbed levels and are consequently of the order of @xmath29 . actually the collectivity is associated with th existence or not of broken pairs .",
    "the state with zero seniority is _ the collective state _ and has the lowest energy .",
    "the other states , with @xmath30 , correspond to larger energies , but the broken pairs still contribute to the energy through the pauli principle .    hence , having chosen @xmath22 it is natural to split , introducing an integer @xmath31 , the solutions @xmath9 into two subsets @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the condition @xmath34 .",
    "thus in this partition the first @xmath31 pairs are trapped while the others take part in setting up the collective excitations of the system .",
    "clearly @xmath31 just corresponds to the gaudin number @xmath35  @xcite , which in turn is related to the `` like - seniority ''",
    "@xmath36 introduced in @xcite according to @xmath37 .",
    "consider then the equations for the @xmath38 with @xmath39 ( the `` large '' energies ) : by expanding in powers of the small quantities @xmath9 and @xmath6 we get @xmath40    likewise the first @xmath31 equations , related to the trapped solutions , can be expanded as follows @xmath41 the equations and are of course exact providing the above expansions converge .",
    "we introduce next the statistical moments of the levels distribution according to  . ]",
    "@xmath42 ( note that @xmath43 , @xmath44 by definition and , of course , @xmath45 ) and rewrite the unknown @xmath46 in terms of the new dimensionless variables @xmath47 as follows @xmath48 then eqs . and become , respectively , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eqs . and",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are assumed to be regular functions of @xmath53 in some neighborhood of the origin , to have a finite , non - vanishing limit when @xmath54 and to admit a taylor expansion .",
    "eq . can be conveniently rewritten as @xmath55    \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{y_j}\\right)^m+\\frac{2}{\\omega }      \\sum_{\\substack{p = k+1\\\\ p\\not = j}}^n\\frac{1}{y_p - y_j}+1=0~,\\ ] ] having defined @xmath56= m^{(m)}-\\frac{2}{\\omega}\\sum_{p=1}^{k }      z_p^m~,\\ ] ] a form explicitly displaying the renormalization of the moments of the level distribution induced by the dynamics of the trapped pairs .    from",
    "then it clearly follows @xmath57",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{y_j}\\right)^m+\\frac{2}{\\omega }      \\sum_{\\substack{p = k+1\\\\ p\\not = j}}^n\\frac{1}{y_p - y_j}+1\\right\\}=0~,\\ ] ] an expression which will turn out to be useful later on .    before examining explicitly the expansion in powers of @xmath53",
    "let us briefly discuss eqs . and .",
    "we observe first of all that the case of 0 like - seniority ( with no renormalization of the moments ) coincides with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite and is already a generalization of the case handled in ref .",
    "@xcite since in the moments of the level distribution are generic whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the choice @xmath16 is made , which is appropriate for a system of electrons , but not of nucleons .",
    "moreover we shall show in the following that it is possible to write recursively ( but not in a closed form ! ) the energy of the system associated with the untrapped pairs at a given order in @xmath53 and eq .",
    "clearly shows that at a given order @xmath58 only the first @xmath58 moments of the level distribution contribute to this energy . at the leading order",
    "we expect of course to recover the result of the degenerate case , the first order is absent because @xmath59 while the second is meaningful and so on .",
    "furthermore it turns out that the impact of the trapped pairs on the energy of the collective state ( see the eq . ) amounts to a renormalization of the moments of the level distribution .",
    "likewise , for the trapped solutions at leading order a similar effect occurs . indeed , at leading order ( namely , @xmath60 in eq .  )",
    "the collective component of the state ( namely the untrapped energies ) renormalizes the coupling constant acting in the sector of the @xmath31 trapped solutions according to the replacement @xmath61    thus we surmise the following iterative procedure : we first solve eq . at the leading order ( @xmath62 ) , next we determine the rhs of eq . at the order @xmath63 and solve the equation ( eventually numerically ) , then we come back to eq . and so on .    in the next section",
    "we shall deal at leading order ( namely in the very large coupling limit ) with the collective component of the state energy .",
    "it is clear that when a collective state develops with a large binding energy , then @xmath23 has to be quite small and , accordingly , the energy of the degenerate case , namely @xmath64 should be recovered .",
    "we want now to show that a similar formula ( i.e. , up to the replacement @xmath65 ) holds at the leading order in the strong coupling expansion for the gaudin excited states as well .    to this purpose",
    "we go back to eq . keeping only the term @xmath60 . expanding @xmath66 as follows @xmath67 to leading order , eq . then reads @xmath68 where only the three quantities @xmath36 , @xmath3 and @xmath69 ( expressed by integer numbers ) appear , while the dependence upon the coupling constant is embedded in the rescaling of eq . .",
    "the further rescaling @xmath70 leads to the system @xmath71 which , redefining @xmath69 and @xmath3 according to the prescriptions @xmath72 can be recast as follows @xmath73 having set for later convenience @xmath74 .",
    "note that at leading order from it follows the relation @xmath75 .",
    "represent the key ingredient in describing the dynamics of the strong coupling limit at the leading and at the higher order as well .",
    "to further proceed consider the equation @xmath76 whose properties are extensively described in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "here we first recall that , as found out in ref.@xcite , the solutions of are given by the zeros of a laguerre polynomial and that the sum @xmath77 can be analytically expressed . for this purpose",
    "we specify eq . to the case @xmath78 and use .",
    "thus the first term of the sum yields @xmath3 .",
    "then the contributions to the sum stemming from the second term can be collected pairwise to get @xmath79 and since the number of such pairs is @xmath80 they sum up to @xmath81 .",
    "finally the third term yields the required quantity .",
    "thus we end up with @xmath82    the above sum fully determines the behaviour of _ all _ the energies of the collective pairs for any state of any system ( i.e. with any @xmath3 and @xmath36 ) in the strong coupling limit , yielding ( we recall that @xmath83 ) @xmath84 the total energy of the ground state is of course the sum of the @xmath9 and owing to it turns out to be @xmath85\\\\ %     & = \\frac{2\\sigma}{\\alpha\\omega}\\left(n-\\frac{v_l}{2}\\right ) %     \\left(\\omega - n-\\frac{v_l}{2}+1\\right)\\\\      & = -g\\left(n-\\frac{v_l}{2}\\right)\\left(\\omega - n-\\frac{v_l}{2}+1\\right)~ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] coinciding with up to the replacement @xmath86 .",
    "this result reflects the meaning of like - seniority .",
    "we are dealing in fact with @xmath3 pairs all coupled to @xmath87 , hence with a zero seniority state , but the physics of the collective component of the state is not ruled by @xmath3 , but instead by those pairs that take part in the setting up of the collectivity , i.e. , that are not trapped .",
    "the trapped pairs turn out to be irrelevant to the energy of the system at this order in @xmath53 and play essentially the same role of the broken pairs .",
    "these are the pairs coupled to an angular momentum @xmath88 , which set up the seniority .",
    "they do not interact with the other ones and therefore are simply accounted for by    1 .   adding their unperturbed energies @xmath89 to the total energy , 2 .",
    "reducing each @xmath5 by one unit each time a pair coupled to @xmath88 lives in the @xmath90 level ( blocking effect ) providing the partners of the pair live on the same s.p.l .",
    "we conclude that the dynamics of the collective component of the states of a system with @xmath3 pairs , whatever the degree of collectivity might be , is ruled in the strong coupling limit by the equations , which is free of parameters , but for the integers @xmath69 , and by the scaling law . also worth recalling",
    "is that the richardson s equations for @xmath3 pairs are based on the bethe ansatz @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a normalization factor and @xmath93 the quasi - spin operator .",
    "the bethe ansatz represents an eigenstate of the pairing hamitonian if the parameters @xmath94 fulfill the re . as a consequence",
    "the scaling properties of the pair energies @xmath94 above discussed entail analogous properties for the wave function of the system .",
    "in this section we address the problem of computing the contribution of the energies of the trapped pairs to the total energy of the states . for these",
    "we have been unable to provide a strong coupling expansion , however we show that they fulfill a system of equations which , in leading order , decouples from the richardson system for the untrapped pairs .",
    "furthermore this system allows one to identify the unperturbed configuration from where each trapped contribution arises @xcite .    to see this we expand @xmath95 as @xmath96 and using eq .",
    "we can rewrite eqs . at the leading order in the form @xmath97 as above mentioned no closed form can be given for the solutions of ( [ eq : a038 ] ) , however the numerical solution now only concerns the @xmath31 trapped pairs instead of the full set of @xmath3 pairs .",
    "we give here an example of how our approximation scheme works as compared with the exact solution by considering a schematic model of the lead isotope @xmath98 . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we quote the experimental s.p.l . of the shell @xmath99 and the associated energies taken from @xcite ( the zero of",
    "the energy is arbitrary ) .",
    ".level structure of the highest neutron shell of lead [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we test the efficiency of the formalism previously developed by comparing its predictions with the exact results obtained by numerically solving the re in the specific example of our toy model for @xmath100 .",
    "we also search for the range of values of the coupling constant @xmath53 ( or @xmath0 ) where our strong coupling expansion holds valid .",
    "this we do by discussing the analytic properties in @xmath0 of the solutions @xmath9 ( @xmath101 ) ( and hence of the system s total energy @xmath102 ) of the re",
    ".      it was discovered by richardson @xcite that some critical values of @xmath0 may exist where a level with pair degeneracy @xmath5 tries to host @xmath103 pairs .",
    "these critical points necessarily appear in the case of the metals .",
    "in fact here for @xmath104 the pair energies @xmath9 tend to the unperturbed values @xmath105 , which are real .",
    "but to reach the collective state at high @xmath0 all the @xmath9 , but the lowest one , must escape from the grid set up by the poles displayed by the re , which are placed at the unperturbed single particle energies . as it is well - known , the escaping mechanism relates to the evolution with @xmath0 of the pair energies . considering a specific @xmath9 , note that it starts from the real value @xmath106 at @xmath107 and then merges with the lower neighbour solution @xmath108 at the energy @xmath109 for a particular critical value of @xmath0 . beyond this critical point",
    "the two pair energies @xmath9 and @xmath108 become complex conjugate and their imaginary part enable them to overcome all the other obstacles to their evasion from the grid .",
    "this mechanism is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for a typical case of equally spaced unperturbed levels with unit pair degeneracy .",
    "one would expect these critical values of @xmath0 to play a crucial role in determining the convergence domain of the strong coupling expansion for the system s energy .",
    "actually the situation turns out to be more involved since the singularities of the pair energies @xmath9 cancel out in the sum yielding the total energy of the system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "clearly the situations occurring in nuclear physics are drastically different from the metallic situation since the s.p.l .",
    "energies are different and must be examined case by case .    sticking to our example of @xmath100 we have drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the real parts of the exact solutions of the re .    in this connection",
    "we remind that our model of @xmath100 has 12 pairs in the @xmath99 shell . for sake of illustration",
    "we consider of this nucleus the excited state with @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) .",
    "hence 3 pairs remain trapped : they arise from the @xmath112 and @xmath113 levels . of the remaining 9 ,",
    "5 pairs arise from the @xmath114 level and 4 from the @xmath115 one .",
    "it is found that at very small @xmath0 the energies of the former are proportional to the fifth roots of the unity .",
    "thus 4 of them are complex and the @xmath116 is real .",
    "since all of them decrease as @xmath0 increases , they reach their asymptotic values at high @xmath0 without encountering any singular point .",
    "concerning the energies of the pairs stemming from the @xmath115 level , they are two by two complex conjugate and hence not affected by the trapping mechanism . thus no singularities in @xmath0 arise and one would expect the expansion in @xmath53 for the collective part of the energy to converge everywhere .",
    "note however that this analysis refers to @xmath0 positive and real .    to better illustrate the subtelties of the escaping mechanism we next consider another case ( not realistic ) by interchanging the levels @xmath115 and @xmath114 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "now the lowest level may host only 4 pairs that could reach their asymptotic value with continuity , but the next one has 5 pairs and one of the associated @xmath9 has to be real .",
    "thus it can not escape the trapping , unless through a critical point , that must necessarily exist since the solutions of the re in the strong coupling regime has 9 pairs taking part to the collectivity . thus at this critical value this single solution must meet the four lower ones exactly at the lowest unperturbed level as fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] indeed shows to happen ( note that for @xmath117 the four lowest solutions are accordingly complex and hence only two lines appear in our figure , hardly distinguishable , however , because they are very close to each other ) .",
    "one could be tempted to conclude that the validity of the power expansion in @xmath53 ends at @xmath118 , but , as we shall see in the next section , this is not so .",
    "actually precise statements about the domain of convergence of the strong coupling series are hard to make ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in fact each case should be separately examined .",
    "concerning the existence of critical values of @xmath0 , they depend crucially upon the occupation number of the levels .      in this subsection",
    "we test our approach against the exact solution of the re .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the exact result for the case of the excited state of @xmath100 and compare it with the expansion in powers of @xmath53 up to the order @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 ) .    in the figure we have accounted for an overall energy shift since in our model @xmath121 .",
    "first we observe that the order next to the leading is not vanishing owing to the interaction between the collective mode and the three trapped pairs , but the effect appears to be very small ( indeed the two lines representing the @xmath122 and @xmath123 order are almost superimposed ) .",
    "next it is seen that a very good accord between the re exact solution and our approach is obtained up to @xmath124 : for lower values of @xmath0 it appears that higher order terms in the expansion are required .    however , and importantly , for @xmath125 the terms of the expansion diverge , thus possibly signalling the occurrence of a singularity ( see ref .",
    "note that the highest order in the expansion is the most sensitive to the occurrence of this possible singularity .",
    "this outcome might be related to the well - known result for the energy of a pair living in two levels , a case where obviously critical values of @xmath0 can not exist , which reads @xmath126 being @xmath127 and @xmath128 the distance between the two levels . clearly can be expanded only for @xmath129 . since in our model the average @xmath128",
    "is also approximately 1 , one may conclude that for the excited state of @xmath100 the strong coupling expansion holds valid till values of @xmath0 much smaller than in the case of one pair living in two levels ( assuming the same @xmath0 and @xmath128 in both situations ) .",
    "of course it should be kept in mind that we deal with an _ excited _ ( and not the _ ground _ ) state of @xmath100 where we have six ( and not one ) pairs contributing to the collective part of the energy and where the pair degeneracy of the s.p.l .",
    "is not one .",
    "in fact in general for the ground state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) it turns out that the larger the pair number @xmath3 is , the larger the domain of validity of the strong coupling expansion becomes : in the bcs case , e.g. , which corresponds to the thermodynamic limit , the expansion holds for @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 ) .",
    "note however that in bcs an infinite number of @xmath2 exists filling the range @xmath132  @xcite .    in conclusion while we can not make a precise statement about the radius of convergence of the strong coupling series ( each case requires to be separately examined ) our results confirm that a singularity exists in the complex @xmath0-plane , limiting the validity of the strong coupling expansion to values of @xmath133 , being @xmath134 the smallest element of the set of all the singular points .",
    "notably , @xmath134 is unrelated to the @xmath2 , in fact existing even when there are no @xmath2 , and , furthermore , that our value of @xmath134 appears to be in accord with the finding of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this paper the re , which solve the pairing hamiltonian problem for a system of @xmath3 pairs , are reduced , in the strong coupling limit , to a parameter - free set of equations ( but for the total pair degeneracy of the s.p.l . , @xmath69 ) , namely the set .",
    "the eigenvalues of this system are obtained by solving an algebraic equation of order @xmath3 , whose coefficients are explicitly given in eq . of appendix a.",
    "once the solutions of the system are known , the physical unknown @xmath38 are determined to leading order up to a rescaling . in the case of states of 0 like - seniority ( @xmath135 )",
    "this rescaling is indeed what one would naturally expect , but the rescaling is quite more involved for states of finite @xmath36 .",
    "finally , and remarkably , the total energy of the state can be determined to leading order without solving explicitly the system .    addressing the higher order corrections ,",
    "we have explicitly derived their analytic expressions in the simpler case @xmath136 .",
    "we have shown , in accord with ref .",
    "@xcite , that at the order @xmath58 only @xmath58 parameters are involved in their determination , namely the first @xmath58 moments of the s.p.l . distribution .",
    "when @xmath137 the trapped states renormalize dynamically these moments .    concerning the numerical aspect of our approach , in the general case only one substantial calculation is required , the remaining steps to get the energies involving the solution of simple linear systems .",
    "thus we point out that , although an exact analytic expression for the expansion of the whole energy of the excited states can not be provided because of the coupling of the trapped and untrapped solutions , however order by order in our expansion the two systems of equations yielding the energies of the trapped and untrapped pairs can be decoupled . as a consequence on the one side the collective part of the energy of _",
    "any _ state can indeed be expressed as an expansion and on the other this occurrence offers numerical advantages , especially when @xmath3 is large , and also a better insight on the nature of the excited states of the pairing hamiltonian .    finally the convergence of the series is discussed .",
    "its radius of convergence is set by a singularity lying in the complex plane of the coupling constant , whose exact location crucially depends upon the distribution of the levels",
    ". however the modulus of this singularity must be smaller than the lowest @xmath2 .",
    "its physical meaning represents the minimum value of @xmath0 at which the single particle aspect of the problem can be treated as a perturbation .",
