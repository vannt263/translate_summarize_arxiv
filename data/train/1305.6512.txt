    "for several decades , density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite has been the method of choice for electronic structure calculations due to its unique compromise between accuracy and efficiency .",
    "large efforts have been made to develop better exchange - correlation ( xc- ) functionals continuously pushing the quality of total energy calculations towards the limit of chemical accuracy .",
    "however , it is well known that the kohn - sham single - particle energies do not correspond to physical excitation energies , and in fact the widely used semi - local xc - potentials significantly underestimate quasiparticle ( qp ) energy gaps.@xcite for molecules and insulators better results can be obtained by replacing a fraction of the local exchange potential with the non - local hartree - fock exchange potential , as in the hybrid functionals . in the range - separated hybrids ,",
    "the non - local exchange is used only for the short - range part of the potential .",
    "this improves the quality of semiconductor band structures and leads to faster convergence with k - point sampling , albeit at the cost of introducing an empirical cutoff radius .",
    "still , the ( range - separated ) hybrids tend to underestimate the role of exchange in systems with weak screening , such as low - dimensional structures , and fail to account correctly for the spatial variation in the screening at metal - insulator interfaces ( see below ) .",
    "many - body perturbation theory , on the other hand , offers a powerful and rigorous framework for the calculation of quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations .",
    "the key quantity is the electronic self - energy which is an energy - dependent and spatially non - local analogous of the xc - potential of dft .",
    "the self - energy can be systematically approximated by summing certain classes of perturbation terms to infinite order in the coulomb interaction .",
    "the gw approximation @xcite is the simplest approximation of this kind where the self - energy , @xmath4 , is expanded to first order in the screened interaction .",
    "symbolically it takes the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the green s function and @xmath7 , is the screened interaction . comparing the gw self - energy to the exchange potential , which can be written as @xmath8",
    ", we see that the gw self - energy is essentially a dynamically screened version of the exchange potential .",
    "apart from screening the static exchange potential , the replacement of the bare coulomb interaction by the _ dynamically _ screened potential introduces correlation effects which accounts for the interaction of an electron ( or a hole ) with the polarization charge that it induces in the medium .",
    "this is a highly nonlocal effect that becomes particularly evident at metal / insulator interfaces such as a molecule on a metal surface or the graphene/_h_-bn interfaces studied in the present work . for these systems ,",
    "the correlation takes the form of an image charge effect that reduces the energy gap of the molecule or insulator by up to several electron volts.@xcite    the gw approximation has been applied with great success to a broad class of materials ranging from bulk insulators , semiconductors and metals to low - dimensional systems like nanoclusters , surfaces and molecules ( see e.g. the reviews of refs . ) . beyond the calculation of qp energies , the gw method also serves as starting point for the calculation of optical spectra from the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite and for quantitatively accurate modeling of electron transport at metal - molecule interfaces where the alignment of the molecular energy levels with the metal fermi level is particularly important .",
    "@xcite    in principle , the gw self - energy should be evaluated self - consistently . however , due to the computational demands of such an approach , non - selfconsistent ( g@xmath0w@xmath0 ) calculations with the initial @xmath9 obtained from the local density approximation ( lda ) or similar , have traditionally been preferred .",
    "recently , fully self - consistent gw calculations have been performed for molecular systems yielding energies for the highest occupied orbitals with an absolute deviation from experiments of  0.5 ev.@xcite in comparison , the standard g@xmath0w@xmath0@lda approach was found to yield slightly lower accuracy , while better results were achieved when starting from hartree - fock or hybrid calculations . for solids ,",
    "earlier studies yielded contradictory conclusions regarding the accuracy of self - consistent versus non - selfconsistent gw calculations .",
    "more recently , the quasiparticle selfconsistent gw method , in which the self - energy is evaluated with a selfconsistently determined single - particle hamiltonian , has been shown to yield excellent results for solids .",
    "@xcite    on the practical side",
    ", any implementation of the gw approximation has to deal with similar numerical challenges .",
    "in addition to the already mentioned g@xmath0w@xmath0 approximation , it is common practice to evaluate the qp energies using first - order perturbation theory starting from the kohn - sham eigenvalues thereby avoiding the calculation of off - diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that the qp wave functions are similar to the kohn - sham wave functions . as recently shown for a metal - molecule interface",
    "this is sometimes far from being the case.@xcite another common simplification is the use of a plasmon pole approximation ( ppa ) for the dielectric function .",
    "the ppa leads to a considerable gain in efficiency by removing the need for evaluating the dielectric function at all frequency points and allowing the frequency convolution of @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the gw self - energy to be carried out analytically . in his original paper ,",
    "hedin introduced a static cohsex approximation to the full gw self - energy .",
    "the cohsex approximation is computationally efficient and clearly illustrates the physics described by the gw approximation .",
    "however , its validity is limited to rather special cases and it should generally not be used for quantitative calculations .    in this paper",
    "we document the implementation of the g@xmath0w@xmath0 method in the gpaw open source electronic structure code.@xcite gpaw is based on the projector augmented wave method@xcite and supports both real space grid and plane wave representation for high accuracy as well as numerical atomic orbitals ( lcao ) for high efficiency .",
    "the g@xmath0w@xmath0 implementation is based on plane waves .",
    "the implementation supports both full frequency dependence ( along the real axis ) as well as the plasmon - pole approximation of godby and needs.@xcite for low dimensional systems , in particular 2d systems , a truncated coulomb interaction should be used to avoid the long range interactions between periodically repeated unit cells .",
    "for both solids , molecules and 2d systems , we find that the ppa gives excellent results with significant reduction of the computational efforts .",
    "in contrast , the static cohsex and the pbe0 hybrid yield unsatisfactory results . an interesting alternative to gw",
    "is offered by the local , orbital dependent gllbsc potential which explicitly adds the derivative discontinuity to the kohn - sham energy gap.@xcite the gllbsc band gaps for solids are found to lie on average within @xmath11{ev}$ ] of the g@xmath0w@xmath0 values but give similar accuracy when compared to experimental data .",

    "quasiparticle states provide a rigorous generalization of the concept of single - particle orbitals to interacting electron systems . in this section",
    "we provide a compact , self - contained introduction to the general theory of quasiparticle states with a combined focus on physical interpretation and mathematical rigor .",
    "this presentation is completely formal ; in particular we shall not discuss the physics and computation of specific self - energy approximations .",
    "our presentation is thus complementary to most other papers on the gw method which tend to focus on the theory and derivation of the gw self - energy within the framework of many - body green s function theory . to avoid inessential mathematical complications",
    ", we shall make the assumption that the system under consideration is finite and the relevant excitations are discrete .",
    "we denote the @xmath13-particle many - body eigenstates and energies by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the occupied and unoccupied qp orbitals are denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "having noted this , we can in fact drop the @xmath26 subscripts on the qp states and energies .",
    "we shall do that in most of the following to simplify the notation .",

    "it turns out that the optimal @xmath34 is exactly the qp orbital .",
    "this statement follows simply from the observation ] @xmath35 similarly , @xmath36 is the orbital that makes @xmath37 the best approximation to the excited state @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , the qp wave function @xmath39 is the single - particle orbital that best describes the state of the `` extra '' electron / hole in the excited state @xmath40 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq.qpint ] ) it follows that the norm of a qp orbital is a measure of how well the true excitation can be described as a single - particle excitation .",
    "precisely , @xmath41 and similarly for the norm of @xmath42 .    the definition ( [ eq.qp1 ] ) implies a one - to - one correspondence between qp states and the excited many - body states @xmath43",
    ". obviously , most of the latter are not even approximately of the single - particle type .",
    "these are characterized by a vanishing ( or very small ) norm of the corresponding qp orbital . in case of non - interacting electrons",
    "the qp states have norms 1 or 0 .",
    "the former correspond to single excitations ( slater determinants ) of the form @xmath44 while the latter correspond to multiple particle excitations , e.g. @xmath45 . strictly speaking the term `` quasiparticle '' should be used only for those @xmath46 whose norm is close to 1 . the number of such states and whether any exists at all , depends on the system . for weakly correlated systems",
    ", one can expect a one - to - one correspondence between the qp states with norm @xmath47 and the single - particle states of some effective non - interacting hamiltonian , at least for the low - lying excitations .",
    "below we show that qp states fulfill a generalized eigenvalue equation known as the qp equation , and we derive a useful expression for the norm of a qp state in terms of the self - energy .",
    "the qp states and energies are linked to the single - particle green s function via the lehmann spectral representation@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a complex number and it is understood that the sum runs over both occupied and unoccupied qp states .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 is analytic in the entire complex plane except for the real points @xmath51 which are simple poles .",

    "( [ eq.qp3 ] ) it follows that the norm of the qp states is given by @xmath72 where we have used the hellman - feynman theorem to differentiate @xmath73 .",
    "given a self - energy operator , one must solve the qp equation to obtain the qp states and energies .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that the self - energy must be evaluated at the qp energies which are not known _ a priori_. instead , one can start from an effective non - interacting hamiltonian ( in practice often the kohn - sham hamiltonian ) , @xmath74 | \\psi_i^s \\rangle = \\varepsilon_i^s |\\psi_i^s \\rangle,\\ ] ] and treat @xmath75 using first - order perturbation theory . thus we write @xmath76 with @xmath77 rearranging this equation yields @xmath78 where @xmath79 approximates the true qp norm .    if @xmath80 we can conclude that @xmath81 is not a ( proper ) qp state .",
    "there can be two reasons for this : ( i ) the electrons are strongly correlated and as a consequence the qp picture does not apply , or ( ii ) @xmath81 is not a good approximation to the true qp wave function @xmath82 . while ( i ) is rooted in the physics of the underlying electron system , reason ( ii ) merely says that the kohn - sham orbital do not describe the true many - body exciations well .",
    "for an example where the qp picture is completely valid , i.e. all the qp states have norms very close to 1 or 0 , but where simple non - interacting orbitals do not provide a good approximation to them , we refer to ref .",
    "the self - energy of the gw approximation is given as a product of the green s function and the screened coulomb potential and can be split into an exchange and a correlation part , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the non - local hartree - fock exchange potential .",
    "the correlation contribution ( which we from now on refer to as the self - energy @xmath85 ) is then evaluated by introducing the difference between the screened and the bare coulomb potential @xmath86 : @xmath87 which becomes a convolution in frequency domain : @xmath88 in this way , the exchange and the correlation contributions can be treated separately at different levels of accuracy .",

    "<S> due to the long range coulomb interaction between periodically repeated images , the use of a truncated interaction is found to be essential for obtaining converged results for 2d materials . </S>",
    "<S> for all systems studied , a plasmon pole approximation is found to reproduce the full frequency results to within @xmath1{ev}$ ] with a significant gain in computational speed . as alternative to g@xmath0w@xmath0 , the efficient local gllbsc potential yields significantly better results than the pbe0 hybrid . for completeness , we provide a mathematically rigorous and physically transparent introduction to the notion of quasiparticle states . </S>"
