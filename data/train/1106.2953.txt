    "using their special properties , the potential matrix elements are simply the values of the potential at mesh points , if they are computed with a gauss quadrature . at first sight , this method could look like a discrete variational method , but this is absolutely not the case since the eigenfunctions can be computed at any position . because of the use of the gauss quadrature scheme , the method is not variational but a great accuracy can nevertheless be reached @xcite .",
    "the method presented here relies on a mesh of points built with the zeros of a laguerre polynomial , but a general procedure for deriving other lagrange meshes related to orthogonal or non - orthogonal bases has also been developed @xcite .",
    "even if we only focus on two - body systems in this paper , it is worth mentioning that this method can be extended to treat very accurately three - body systems as well in nuclear physics as in atomic physics ( see for instance ref .",

    "the gauss formula ( [ 2.2 ] ) is exact when @xmath9 is a polynomial of degree @xmath10 at most , multiplied by @xmath11 .",
    "the lagrange - laguerre mesh is then based on the zeros of a laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath1 @xcite and the mesh points are given by @xmath12 .",
    "these zeros can be determined with a high precision with usual methods to find the roots of a polynomial @xcite ( the _ mathematica _ expression ` root ` does the job efficiently ) or as the eigenvalues of a particular tridiagonal matrix @xcite .",
    "the weights can be computed by the following formula @xcite @xmath13 it is worth noting that , for most calculations , it is not necessary to compute the weights @xmath6 .",
    "the original lagrange functions do not vanish at origin , so it is preferable to use the regularized lagrange functions whose explicit form is given by @xmath14 which is a polynomial of degree @xmath1 , multiplied by an exponential function .",
    "such a function @xmath15 vanishes at the origin and at @xmath16 with @xmath17 .    with the lagrange - mesh method ,",
    "the solution of a quantum equation reduces ( as it is often the case ) to the determination of eigensolutions of a given matrix .",

    "so , the variational character of the method can not be guaranteed , except if an exact quadrature is performed . in practice , for a sufficiently high number of basis states ,",
    "the method is often variational ( eigenvalues computed are all upper bounds ) or antivariational ( eigenvalues computed are all lower bounds ) .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the accuracy of the mesh approximation remains close to the accuracy of the original variational calculation without the gauss approximation .",
    "so , in most cases , a very high accuracy can be achieved in the framework of the gauss approximation , though the mathematical reasons for the high efficiency of this method are not well known yet @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the eigensolutions depends on two parameters : the number of mesh points @xmath1 and the value of the scale parameter @xmath27 . for a sufficiently high value of @xmath1 ( which can be as low as 20 or 30 ) , the eigenvalues present a large plateau as a function of @xmath27",
    "this is a great advantage for the lagrange - mesh method since the non - linear parameter must not be determined with a high precision .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath27 is too small , a significant part of the wavefunction is not covered by the points of the lagrange mesh .",
    "when @xmath27 is too large , all points of the mesh are located in the asymptotic tail of the wavefunctions and it is then impossible to obtain good eigenvalues .",

    "a very high accuracy can be obtained with this simple procedure @xcite .",
    "for some particular problems , it can be useful to compute the fourier transform of a wavefunction in the position space in order to obtain the corresponding wavefunction in the momentum space .",

    "actually , it is easier and much more efficient to compute directly @xmath83 the matrix elements @xmath84 can be determined by a procedure identical to the one used to compute @xmath85 .",
    "an intermediate step is the calculation of the matrix @xmath86 , a diagonal matrix obtained by taking the function @xmath87 of all diagonal elements of @xmath45 ( remember that @xmath36 is linked to the matrix elements of @xmath88 , not @xmath82 ) .",

    "note that equation ( 36 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite has an analytical solution given by ( @xmath35 is replaced here by @xmath109 in order to match the present notations and to avoid a confusion with the last lagrange - mesh point ) @xmath115^{1/m},\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the lambert function @xcite and @xmath117 or 2 depending on the trial function @xmath118 .    at this stage",
    ", the ratio @xmath119 corresponds approximately to a radial distance in the asymptotic tail of an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath120 .",
    "the idea is to identify this distance with the value of @xmath33 for the genuine hamiltonian considered .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this procedure works quite well and can give a value of the scale parameter @xmath27 ( @xmath34 ) in the plateau mentioned above .",
    "the efficiency of this ansatz is due to the fact that the value of @xmath27 must not be known with a great accuracy in the lagrange - mesh method .",
    "so , a crude determination of @xmath33 is sufficient and it is not necessary to go beyond the use of the very simple trial functions @xmath118 mentioned above and the approximation ( [ appt ] ) for the computation of the kinetic contribution .    to determine an estimation of @xmath77 , let us look at the fourier transform @xmath121 of the trial states considered @xmath122 : @xmath123 if @xmath108 is a harmonic oscillator state , @xmath124 has the same form .",
    "so it seems quite natural to set @xmath125 , since both functions present the same ratio ( [ eps ] ) at the same value of their dimensionless argument .",
    "if the trial state is a hydrogen - like state , the situation is different since @xmath124 decreases much more faster than @xmath108 for large ( but not too large ) values of @xmath114 .",

    "in this section , several tests will be performed for the lagrange - mesh method with both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic kinematics .",
    "we will focus on the quality of wavefunctions and observables in the momentum space since the efficiency of the method in the position space has already been demonstrated elsewhere @xcite . in order to estimate more precisely the quality of the fourier transform ( [ ft7 ] ) , we define a  quality factor \" @xmath127 @xmath128}\\left|   \\frac{\\bar u^\\textrm{ft}(p ) - u^\\textrm{ft}(p)}{\\max_{p\\in[0,p_*]}|   u^\\textrm{ft}(p ) | } \\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath129 given by ( [ ft7 ] ) and @xmath130 is the exact solution in momentum space .",
    "let us consider the ultrarelativistic two - body system with a quadratic potential @xmath131 this hamiltonian is particularly interesting because it is probably the only one with a semirelativistic kinematics which is ( partly ) analytically solvable . with an appropriate change of variable",
    ", this hamiltonian can be recast into the form of a nonrelativistic hamiltonian with a linear interaction @xcite , for which solutions are known for s - states .",

    "the units of the results are given in powers of the unit chosen for the only energy scale of the system @xmath142 .",
    "using the lagrange - mesh method with @xmath143 and @xmath144 , the eigenvalues ( [ eur ] ) can already be obtained with a relative error smaller than 1% .",
