    "it has benefited enormously from the development of bolometer arrays such as scuba ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) and mambo ( kreysa et al .",
    "1998 ) : the commissioning of these groundbreaking cameras , on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the iram 30-m telescope , respectively , yielded a thousand - fold increase in mapping speed over single - pixel devices such as ukt14 ( duncan et al .",
    "1990 ) . a decade on , the next generation of cameras exemplified by laboca ( kreysa et al .",
    "2003 ) and scuba-2 ( holland et al .  2003 ) will yield a similar increase in mapping speed over existing arrays .",
    "scuba brought about a radical shift in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies , with the discovery that luminous , dusty galaxies were a thousand times more abundant in the early universe than at the present day ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; barger et al .",

    "the true triumph of the radio identification procedure , however , has been in identifying the correct optical / ir counterparts so that their morphologies , colours , magnitudes , etc .",
    "can be determined unambiguously ; more importantly , this has also allowed spectroscopists to place their slits accurately , sometimes on apparently blank sky when optical counterparts were too faint for existing imaging ( @xmath6 , e.g.  le850.12 and ssa13.332  chapman et al.2005 ) .",

    "it is clear , therefore , that the observed distribution of radial offsets for the radio identifications is at least comparable with theoretical expectations .",
    "we can quantify this more precisely in two ways .",
    "first , we can use the distribution of radial offsets for all radio identification counterparts and attempt to correct statistically for background contamination : the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ hist - offsets ] represents the distribution and absolute level of a randomly distributed radio population with the counts seen in the lh radio image (  2.1 ) .",
    "the number of radio identifications within a 6-arcsec radius of the submm positions is seen to exceed the random level by almost two orders of magnitude , which gives us ( additional ) confidence that the vast majority of the radio identifications are truly associated with the smgs .",
    "the finite search radius within which we have hunted for radio counterparts explains why the observed number of counterparts falls below that predicted for a random population in the outermost bins of fig .",
    "[ hist - offsets ] .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ hist - offsets ] uses _ all _ the radio identifications , rather than just those with the lowest @xmath22 values , so any bias present is due only to the finite search radii used to find radio emitters for this analysis ( 12.5arcsec ) .",
    "having corrected the observed distributions for the expected unrelated ` field ' radio sources ( those in the background and foreground ) , a gaussian fit centred at @xmath40arcsec , shown in fig .",
    "[ hist - offsets ] , yields a fwhm of 7.5@xmath410.7arcsec ( 7.4@xmath410.6arcsec if the centroid is unconstrained ) .",
    "this translates into @xmath33 = fwhm/2.354 = 3.2arcsec .",
    "our correction for the expected ` field ' sources should have dealt with any broadening due to radio sources unrelated to the smgs .",
    "the median snr of the radio - detected sample used in this analysis is 3.0 , after correction for malmquist - type bias , which implies that @xmath42 , adopting @xmath30 = 14.5arcsec , i.e.  10 per cent higher than expected .",
    "this procedure was replicated for the 24-@xmath0 m counterparts listed in tables  [ 24um - lh ] and [ 24um - sxdf ] , correcting for blank - field , background source densities of 4.5 and 1.2arcmin@xmath43 to limits of 50 and 150@xmath0jy , respectively .",
    "the result , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ hist - offsets ] , is a wider distribution , borne out by the best - fit gaussian : a fwhm of 10.7@xmath411.0arcsec , when constrained to be centred at @xmath40arcsec , or @xmath44",
    "= 4.5arcsec .",
    "the low accuracy of the 24-@xmath0 m positions relative to those determined at 1.4ghz can account for most of the extra width .    as a second way of quantifying this approach",

    "[ hist - jsd ] , where it is compared with the predicted cumulative distribution ( @xmath46 ) , using @xmath47 as discussed in appendix b. for this calculation we have adopted @xmath30 = 14.5arcsec and snr = 3.17 ( the average snr for the deboosted 850-@xmath0 m flux densities of these 62 sources ) .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the predicted distribution is in excellent agreement with that observed for this secure subset of identified sources ; indeed , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test yields a 57-per - cent probability that the data are consistent with the model . for completeness , the right - hand panel in fig .",

    "these plots give confidence that the radial offset distribution of secure identifications is consistent with that expected given the jcmt s beam and the deboosted 850-@xmath0 m flux densities of the shades sources and that there is no additional significant source of astrometric error in the submm maps .",
    "they also demonstrate the importance of using the @xmath22 statistic to filter the candidate list of associations for robust identifications .    in conclusion",
    ", there is no evidence for significant additional sources of positional error . for an smg discovered in a submm survey where a malmquist - type bias correction has not been applied",

    "these correspond to conventional 1-@xmath32 error circles .",
    "we return now to our initial motivation for this study of positional uncertainty , namely the feasibility of a spectroscopic redshift distribution for smgs based on kmos near - ir spectroscopy of an unbiased sample .",
    "such a programme could afford to lose one smg due to positional error during a single deployment of the 24 kmos ifus .",
    "each ifu covers 2.8@xmath72.8-arcsec@xmath8 so , leaving room for seeing effects , we require @xmath53arcsec to ensure that 95.6 per cent of smgs fall within the central 5arcsec@xmath8 of each ifu .",

    "this revealed that the calibration of the @xmath22 statistic is secure , with @xmath57 yielding 5.05 spurious associations for every 100 fake smgs .",
    "multiple robust counterparts are far rarer , however . for every 100 fake smgs",
    "the simulations suggest that only 0.22 will have more than one secure radio identification by chance , a figure dominated by doubles , so at first sight the observed tendency for multiple robust radio counterparts is highly significant .",
    "however , we know that around half ( 65 ) of the shades smgs have a _ real _ association with a radio emitter , or 59 after accounting for the six spurious identifications we expect ( 0.05@xmath7120 ) , so should we be surprised to find a dozen smgs with multiple radio identifications ? of the radio - identified shades smgs , 5 per cent will be spuriously associated with another radio source .",
    "we thus expect three multiple identifications whereas we see a dozen : a significant difference .",
    "looking at this another way , the fraction of radio - identified smgs with multiple radio counterparts is 18.5@xmath415.3 per cent ( 12/65 ) , 15.4@xmath414.9 per cent ( 10 ) with separations below 6arcsec .",

    "the number of smgs with separations below 10arcsec , and particularly below 6arcsec , is thus significant .",
    "interestingly , bright smgs make up one in seven of all radio multiples with separations below 6arcsec .    what causes this multiplicity ?",
    "at least three mechanisms could be responsible : agn - driven jets ; physical interactions ; and confusion .",
    "discriminating between these mechanisms is extremely difficult . the first  jets  could be revealed via their morphology or their radio spectral index , but to date neither property has been probed for a significant sample . the spectroscopic evidence required to reveal the second possibility  a physical association  is available only rarely in the shades fields , although a number of linked , multiple systems with few - arcsec separations and near - identical redshifts have been documented elsewhere ( ivison et al .",

    "the probability of a 24-mjy smg lying within 7arcsec of another source is @xmath11 per cent , so we could expect to see two of these amalgamated sources at flux densities between 4 and 8mjy in the shades sample . this flux density range accounts for 62.5 per cent of the full sample , so we might expect around three such sources in total ( perhaps rather more if we included amalgamations of far more common , fainter sources ) . of these three",
    ", two should have a real radio identification ; one may have several .",
    "the difficulty we face in exploring this small subset of amalgamated sources is in knowing which of the shades smgs they are .",
    "one prediction might be that they are expected to have fainter counterparts at other wavelengths , but even this may be premature ( serjeant et al .",
    "we must content ourselves with the knowledge that they should be revealed via scuba-2 450-@xmath0 m imaging in the near future .    without spectroscopic data we can not determine whether physical interactions or confusion make up the majority of the smgs with multiple identifications , let alone whether bright smgs are special cases where two massive components are merging , as suggested by smail et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "the median deboosted submm flux density of the shades source catalogue is 5.0mjy ; the error - weighted mean 850-@xmath0 m flux density of smgs with more than one radio counterpart is @xmath60mjy ; that for a comparison sample , the 48 smgs with a single @xmath16 radio counterpart , is @xmath61mjy , so the simplest approach yields no evidence of a difference between smgs with single and multiple identifications .",
    "[ nflux ] shows the distribution of deboosted submm flux density for the whole shades source catalogue and for those sources with multiple robust counterparts at 1.4ghz or 24@xmath0 m .",
    "taking the median shades flux density as our threshold , eight multiple identifications lie above and 11 lie below , respectively ( six apiece using only the radio ) .",
    "however , as our flux density threshold rises to 10mjy so the fraction of sources with multiple identifications rises from 15/111 to 4/9 ( or 8/111 to 4/9 using only the radio ) ; even ignoring the high probability that one of the remaining five bright sources may be spurious ( sxdf850.45 ) and that another has several possible counterparts ( lock850.34  table  [ id - summary ] ) , this is a significant trend .",
    "it is plausible that these sources are examples of confusion ( i.e.  amalgamated sources ) but we note that the physically linked systems reported to date are often similarly bright .",
    "we conclude that the incidence of very high flux density and counterpart multiplicity are weakly linked and that the case for a preferred separation between multiple counterparts is plausible but not proven .",
    "in particular , we note that almost half of the brightest nine smgs ",
    "all @xmath6210mjy  have multiple radio counterparts and that all have separations in the range 26arcsec , or 2070kpc at their likely redshifts and at an inclination of 45@xmath9 to the sky , perhaps enabling efficient gas fueling for central starbursts or agn via overlapping galactic disks  see the qualitative discussion and illustrations ( particularly figs  1113 ) in the merger simulations of springel , di matteo , & hernquist ( 2005 ) where a particularly intense burst of activity occurs on first passage for systems that lack prominent bulges , with galaxy separations of @xmath130kpc for the subsequent few tens of myr .",
    "following ivison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we seek to exploit the clear prediction that spurious smgs will lack radio or mid - ir counterparts .",
    "genuine sources can , of course , evade radio or mid - ir detection  because they lie at extreme redshift , for example ( see ivison et al .",
    "2005 )  but general trends in the identification rate may be evident . in this section",
    "we therefore explore what can be learned about the smgs without counterparts .",
    "[ trends ] shows the cumulative identification rate for smgs in the lh and sxdf fields as a function of submm snr ( before and after flux deboosting ) , deboosted submm flux density and submm flux uncertainty .",
    "looking at the radio identification trends as functions of submm flux density and noise , we see the recovery rate tailing off at the faintest flux density limits ( @xmath635mjy ) in sxdf , whereas the rate is remarkably flat for fainter flux densities in the lh field .",
    "both fields show improving identification rates as the submm noise declines , despite the deboosting procedures outlined in paper ii  a worrying trend , though we should bear in mind that searching for identifications within a fixed radius must act as a bias against low - snr sources . for the highest values of submm flux density and noise we see similarities with trends discussed by ivison et al.(2002 ) for the 8-mjy survey ,",
    "i.e.  the brightest source in each field lies in a region with high noise , and neither has a robust radio counterpart .",
    "the sxdf radio identification rate versus raw submm snr shows a steep decline below an snr of 4 ; after flux deboosting this effect is mitigated somewhat , with matching trends in the sxdf and lh fields .",
    "it is noteworthy that the overall radio recovery rate in sxdf is over 10 per cent higher than in the lh field , despite the shallower depth of the sxdf radio imaging .",
    "we attribute this to three effects , each of which we believe contributes to the unexpectedly low lh identification rate : first , the lh radio image is a single pointing , designed originally to identify smgs in the small 8-mjy survey field ( cf .  a mosaic of three in sxdf ) , so the pernicious effect of bandwidth smearing will be evident for a significantly larger fraction of the shades field in lh than in sxdf ; second , although it is clearly useful to work with the best possible radio data , deep imaging inevitably yields more faint , unrelated , background sources , causing @xmath22 values for relatively bright counterparts to rise relative to those calculated for a lower source density ; third , it is possible ( though it has yet to be shown unambiguously",
    " ivison et al .  2002 ; chapman et al .  2004 ; muxlow et al .  2005 ) that a significant fraction of the emission in some smgs is resolved by high - resolution radio data .",
    "that these effects are significant , collectively , is demonstrated by the significantly higher smg identification rate in the shallower , lower resolution sxdf data ; in addition , seven lh smgs ( lock850.10 , .34 , .37 , .38 , .40 , .77 and .100 ) are detected robustly only in the noisier , low - resolution radio image , though we note that in several cases the 4.2-arcsec fwhm image alone does not allow us to differentiate between plausible spectroscopic targets .",
    "there are several lessons here : ensure interferometric data contain an adequate fraction of short spacings  a synthesised beam with 1.52arcsec fwhm provides a good compromise for identification of fir - luminous galaxies ; where necessary , i.e.  when the area of interest is similar to that of the radio interferometer s primary beam and the spectral resolution is poor ( @xmath64 ) , obtain data in a compact mosaic of pointings rather than a single , deep pointing .",
    "the trend of overall recovery rate is reversed in the mid - ir , the lh yielding a 20 per cent higher identification rate than the sxdf .",
    "the reason is obvious , however : it is due to the substantial extra depth of the lh _",
    "24-@xmath0 m data ( @xmath65 versus 47@xmath0jy ) .",
    "only one smg is identified solely on the basis of its mid - ir emission in sxdf compared with ten in the lh . for both fields",
    "the decline at low deboosted snr is less marked than the radio trend . against submm flux density and noise , the 24-@xmath0 m identification trends for both fields",
    "match those at radio wavelengths ( with the aforementioned 20 per cent offset for the sxdf sources ) ; the very brightest sources again lack robust counterparts .      the lower row of plots in fig .",
    "[ trends ] show the _ overall _ identification trends  the fraction of sources identified at 1.4ghz and/or 24@xmath0 m , including the three cases mentioned in ",
    "[ associations ] where weak radio and 24-@xmath0 m counterparts are coincident ( one of which is the brightest lh source , lock850.34 ) .",
    "the identification trends are similar for the two shades fields : identification is essentially complete above a deboosted submm snr of @xmath14 with an abrupt step down to 6070 per cent thereafter ; also , success rates improve as the submm noise declines . the sxdf identification rate tails off below a deboosted submm snr of 2.5 and at submm flux densities below 5mjy",
    ". this may be due to the limited depth of the sxdf radio and 24-@xmath0 m imaging rather than any deficiency of the sxdf catalogue , but we note that it is a strong tendency .",
    "summarising these plots , the best available complementary data in the lh  equivalent to those available in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) northern field  allows us to identify robustly over two thirds of smgs to current submm detection limits . the observed trends in identification rate",
    "give no strong rationale for rejecting any sources from the parent shades source catalogue , although a slight question mark is thrown over some of the lowest snr sources .",
    "since the spectral slopes at 24@xmath0 m and 1.4ghz are similar , it may prove instructive to examine the behaviour of @xmath68 as a function of redshift , as shown in fig .",

    "much of the theory needed for an understanding of scuba position errors can be found in condon ( 1997 ) , which treats the general case of fitting a gaussian ellipsoid to map data , for which there are six free parameters : source coordinates , total flux , two principal axes and a position angle .",
    "for the present application , we generally prefer to assume that scuba sources will not be resolved by the beam , although resolved or blended sources are certainly known ( ivison et al .",
    "2000 ; stevens et al .  2003 ; pope et al .",
    "the map should therefore consist of a scaled and shifted replica of the beam , plus noise .",
    "this leaves just three free parameters .",
    "we follow condon and assume that the beam is a single 2d gaussian with an r.m.s .",
    "` width ' @xmath32 ( @xmath101 ) in each coordinate .",
    "let the coordinates of the centroid be @xmath102 and assume that the map is digitised on a ( fine ) grid where the pixel spacing is @xmath103 and the noise value at each pixel is an independent zero - mean gaussian deviate with r.m.s .",
    "value , @xmath0 ; the units of @xmath0 are those of surface brightness .",
    "the peak value of the fitted profile is @xmath104 ; strictly , this is a surface brightness value and the total integrated flux density will be @xmath105 .",
    "however , normally the factor @xmath106 will be absorbed into map units of mjybeam@xmath14 or equivalent , so that @xmath104 has the numerical value of the flux density of a fitted unresolved source . with this notation , condon s solution for the r.m.s .",
    "errors ( @xmath107 ) on the three - parameter fit is @xmath108 for a practical formula , it makes sense to combine these by defining the flux signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath109 : @xmath110 this is independent of @xmath103 , as makes intuitive sense ( although the derivation assumes @xmath111 ) .",
    "note that condon quotes a larger error in @xmath104 for the 6-parameter case : this appears to be an error , but is in any case irrelevant for the present purpose .",
    "a more serious problem with this result is that often the noise is not independent from pixel to pixel .",
    "this may be inherent in the data ( e.g.  interferometry maps , where the noise has the same coherence structure as a point source ) , or may be a result of smoothing the map . smoothing may arise either via some form of ` drizzling ' in the data reduction software , or can be an explicit convolution .",
    "the prime example of the latter is ` optimal filtering ' in which the map is convolved again with the beam in an attempt to improve the visibility of true sources in comparison with the noise .",
    "this was the strategy used by scott et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to identify candidate sources for detailed fitting to the unsmoothed data . in this case",
    "there is no fitting of the position of the source : the position is taken as the location of a peak in the filtered map .",
    "a slightly more general problem is now to consider a ` source ' in the form of a gaussian of height @xmath112 and width @xmath113 superimposed on a correlated noise field @xmath114 produced by smoothing white noise with a gaussian of width @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting noise field will have an r.m.s .",
    "value @xmath115 and we are interested in both @xmath116 and the error in the position of the peak .",
    "the latter can be solved by considering a taylor expansion of the signal @xmath117 around the peak ( in one coordinate , @xmath118 , and assuming the true source to be centred at @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes @xmath122 , etc . for large @xmath112",
    ", the last term is negligible , so the apparent position of the peak is just @xmath123 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "positional errors in each coordinate are then @xmath124 the r.m.s",
    ".  value of the gradient in gaussian - filtered white noise is straightforward to evaluate ( e.g. using equations 16.41 and 16.42 of peacock 1999 ) : @xmath125 in terms of @xmath116 , this gives @xmath126    the appropriate value of @xmath113 depends on the application . for interferometry data , @xmath127 , so we have @xmath128 for the case of optimal filtering , the source is broadened so that @xmath129 , yielding @xmath110 this is of the identical form to the result for the gridded data .",
    "however , the definitions of @xmath130 are different in the two cases ; to finish , we need to prove that they are , in practice , identical .",
    "first , suppose we allow ourselves any filtering scale , @xmath131 .",
    "the filtered source width satisfies @xmath132 and flux conservation gives @xmath133 .",
    "the r.m.s .  of the filtered white noise can be worked out most simply by fourier transforming the original noise field , multiplying by the transform of a gaussian filter and squaring to get the new noise power spectrum , which is then integrated to get the new noise variance .",
    "the unfiltered noise variance is derived by considering a constant power spectrum over the nyquist range of wavenumbers between @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the filtered result can then be expressed as @xmath136 ( provided @xmath137 ) , so the snr of the filtered peak is @xmath138 this has a maximum at @xmath139 , verifying the optimal filter result and giving @xmath140 which is identical to condon s result ( eqn 1 ) .",
    "thus , we have verified that optimal filtering returns the same snr as direct fitting to the pixel data , and shown that it also yields identical positional errors .",
    "it is well known that a flux - limited sample selected in the presence of noisy fluxes suffers two related effects : too many sources are found ( eddington bias ) and the selected sources have their fluxes systematically over - estimated .",
    "this is sometimes loosely called malmquist bias although , strictly speaking , malmquist bias is the effect on the mean flux of a distribution due to the imposition of a flux limit .",
    "a malmquist bias persists even without noise .",
    "a more prosaic term for the latter effect is ` flux boosting ' ; in practice the observed snr values for scuba sources will thus be too high .",
    "the standard form for the malmquist correction ( see e.g.  3.6.1 of binney & merrifield 1998 ) in magnitude units is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the differential number counts and here @xmath32 means the r.m.s .",
    "magnitude error .",
    "we shall assume power - law counts with @xmath50 , so that @xmath143 , and the apparent snr from the malmquist formula is @xmath144    however , the binney & merrifield formula does not apply in this case , because the measurements are subject to flux errors , rather than the magnitude errors assumed in their approach .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the appropriate correction by taking a bayesian approach , as has also been followed in coppin et al .",
    "if the apparent flux is @xmath145 , we want to know the conditional distribution of the corresponding true flux , @xmath146 , which is @xmath147 the prior , @xmath148 is just the ( power - law ) number counts , and @xmath149 is just the gaussian error distribution @xmath150 $ ] ( we implicitly set the r.m.s .",
    "noise equal to unity , so as to work in snr units ) .",
    "this equation has the drawback that @xmath151 diverges at @xmath152 , reflecting the fact that the confusion limit has not been allowed for , but there is a well - defined maximum is the conditional distribution , and we take this as the best estimate of @xmath146 given @xmath145 .",
    "this is easily shown to be @xmath153    before adopting this as a correction for flux boosting , however , there is one further correction to consider , which increases the size of the effect .",
    "this arises because we have assumed implicitly that the location of the source is known , so that the apparent flux is the true flux plus a noise term .",
    "but we have shown above that the existence of a noise field inevitably introduces position errors , so that we are never measuring exactly at the true position of the source .",
    "the effect of position errors on the apparent flux is easy to analyse , following our earlier formulae .",
    "the variation in signal with one coordinate , @xmath118 , around a peak is approximately @xmath154 and we have already shown the effect of the noise gradient @xmath121 in perturbing the position of the peak .",
    "but it also perturbs the _ height _ of the peak , which is the apparent flux : @xmath155 for gaussian noise , the gradient @xmath121 is independent of the amplitude of the noise , @xmath156 , so there is an additional boost of the flux  which is largest for those sources with the largest positional errors . in terms of the offset in one",
    "coordinate , @xmath157 , the flux boost is @xmath158 there is an independent effect from each coordinate , so that the expected size of the boost from gradients is @xmath159 using our previous expression for the r.m.s .",
    "we will ignore the dispersion in this correction , since it is usually much smaller than the dispersion in @xmath156 .",
    "since the noise field and the noise gradient are independent , we can correct for them in turn .",
    "if we take out previous deboosted estimate , @xmath146 , the correction for gradient bias to yield the final estimate of the true flux , @xmath160 , is @xmath161 ( where we have assumed optimal filtering , so @xmath162 ) .",
    "combining these two steps yields a cumbersome expression for the true snr in terms of the apparent snr , and we advocate the following convenient approximation as suitable for use when the apparent snr exceeds 3 : @xmath163 our final suggested formula for the expected position errors is thus @xmath164^{-1/2 } \\ , { \\rm fwhm}.\\ ] ]      it may seem self - evident that optimal filtering as discussed above is also the best strategy for source detection ( neglecting confusion )  but this is not so obvious . optimal filtering gives the most accurate measurement of the flux for a given source . for detection , we want to minimise the probability of noise alone yielding a spurious source of the observed height .",
    "if we smooth an image with a filter that is broader than optimal , the apparent snr goes down  but nevertheless the expected number of noise peaks on the image of this new height may go down , just because of the larger coherence length in the new noise field .",
    "this all works out quite simply for gaussian filtering and a gaussian source : the apparent snr ( @xmath165 ) is @xmath166 where @xmath167 and snr means the standard optimally - filtered value .",
    "the number density of peaks with height above @xmath168 is proportional to @xmath169 ( for @xmath170 ; see bond & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "so , we need to vary @xmath171 to minimise @xmath172 . as a function of the optimally - filtered snr",
    ", the numerical value of the required @xmath171 can be approximated empirically by @xmath173 thus , for our typical 4-@xmath32 threshold , we should in principle filter with something about 15 per cent broader than the beam to give us the best chance that the sources are real .",
    "this is not a big effect and we have chosen to ignore it , but it is an interesting point of principle ."
