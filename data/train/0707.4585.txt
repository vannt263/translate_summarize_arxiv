    "eigenfunction and spectral statistics in quantum systems with quenched disorder were a subject of intense study @xcite in the context of mesoscopic fluctuations of conductance and density of states ( dos ) , in particular in quantum dots @xcite . for this application",
    "the most relevant is the regime of weak deviation @xcite from the wigner - dyson statistics given by the conventional random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "disordered multi - channel quantum wires is the most important example of systems where single - particle eigenstates are all localized . here",
    "the statistics of eigenstates require a non - perturbative treatment using the formalism of nonlinear sigma - model @xcite or banded random matrices @xcite .",
    "a special class are systems with the critical , multifractal ( mf ) eigenstate statistics @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional disordered metals fall in this class @xcite provided that effects of localization are suppressed by magnetic field .",
    "otherwise , one can speak only on weak multifractality which turns to localization before being fully developed .",
    "the true physical realizations of the critical , mf eigenstate statistics are systems at the critical point of the anderson localization transition @xcite and the integer quantum hall systems at the center of landau band @xcite .",
    "importantly , the class of systems with mf eigenstate statistics also allows for a random matrix representation @xcite , in particular using the power - law banded random matrices ( plbrm ) @xcite .",
    "another field of intense research is the interplay between disorder and electron interaction with the seminal results on quantum correction to the tunnel dos and conductivity @xcite of disordered two - dimensional metals and the correction to superconducting transition temperature due to a simultaneous effect of disorder and the coulomb interaction @xcite . in all those works disorder and interaction",
    "are taken into account essentially perturbatively along the lines given in @xcite .",
    "recently there was an attempt @xcite to consider the problem of superconductivity near the anderson transition in which disorder has been treated non - perturbatively by _ postulating _ the mf statistics of one - particle states @xmath5 that enter the matrix element of a phenomenological electron attraction : @xmath6 in particular , the simplest quantity of interest is the disorder average matrix element @xmath7 at a given energy separation @xmath8 between one - particle energies @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for real eigenfunctions ( orthogonal symmetry class )",
    "it is proportional to the correlation function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the spectral correlation function which is close to 1 for @xmath8 much greater then the mean level spacing .",
    "the correlation function @xmath14 is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "the correlation function defined by eq.([c ] ) is a measure of overlap of _ two different _ eigenfunctions . for truly extended normalized states ( e.g. in a quantum dot ) @xmath15 and thus @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a system volume .",
    "remarkably , @xmath16 is also valid for classical examples of localized states , e.g. in a quantum disordered wire . in this case",
    "two states are typically not overlapping but with a small probability of @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the localization radius ) they are localized in the same place and then the integral in eq.([c ] ) is of the order of the inverse localization volume @xmath20 .",
    "there are cases , however , when an eigenfunction @xmath21 does not occupy all the available volume or all the localization volume and the typical amplitude @xmath22 is not just the inverse volume ( for extended states ) or the inverse localization volume ( for localized states ) . in this case a non - trivial behavior of the correlation function @xmath23 is expected .",
    "such situation is realized near the critical point of the anderson localization transition . in the vicinity of this point in the region of extended states",
    "( _ multifractal metal _ ) or in the region of localized states ( _ multifractal insulator _ )",
    "the system retains the characteristic features of the critical multifractal statistics of eigenstates which makes it qualitatively different from both a normal metal or a normal anderson insulator .    in this paper",
    "we will identify and quantify such characteristic features in the correlation function @xmath23 and give their interpretation in terms of the typical behavior of single - particle states . to attain this goal",
    "we will combine new analytical results for the plbrm with numerics on the plbrm and the anderson model .",
    "we specially focus on the dependence of @xmath23 on the energy difference @xmath8 in the cross - over region in the vicinity but not exactly at the anderson transition point which has not been studied so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a brief introduction into the subject of multifractality of critical eigenstates focusing on the main effect of multifractality which is the critical enhancement of eigenfunction correlations . in section",
    "iii we give a cartoon of the off - critical states in a multifractal metal and a multifractal insulator and introduce the random matrix theories which may describe them .",
    "in sec.iv we present the results of an analytical theory of eigenfunction correlations for a class of almost diagonal gaussian random matrices which all the rmt s suggested to describe strong multifractality fall into .",
    "in sec.v we consider the two - eigenfunction correlation function exactly at the critical point of the localization transition in the 3d anderson model and for the critical random matrix ensemble in the limit of strong multifractality .",
    "we show that the dynamical scaling relationship suggested by chalker is not violated even in the limit when the fractal dimensions are very small . in section",
    "vi we describe the new phenomenon of eigenfunction mutual avoiding and present a qualitative picture that simultaneously explains the enhancement of eigenfunction correlations at small energy separations and the eigenfunction mutual avoiding at large energy separations . in section vii we consider the properties of eigenfunction correlations in a multifractal insulator . in particular , we describe the new phenomenon of logarithmic enhancement of eigenfunction correlations at small energy separations in the 2d and 3d anderson insulators and show the absence of such enhancement in the quasi-1d case .",
    "we also suggest a truncated critical rm ensemble that describes all the principal features of eigenfunction correlations in the 3d multifractal insulator .",
    "section viii is devoted to the random matrix description of the multifractal metal .",
    "we show that the sub - critical plbrm suggested in ref.@xcite gives a reasonable agreement with the 3d anderson model . by analytical treatment of this rm model we found the region of parameters where the eigenfunction correlations become effectively short - range in the energy space which may poit out on the existence of a new metal phase above some critical dimensionlity in the multi - dimensional anderson model . in the conclusion",
    "we list all the principal results of this paper .",
    "the `` standard '' model ( the anderson model ) for the anderson localization transition in @xmath24 dimensions is the tight - binding model with the hopping constant @xmath25 and random on - site energies @xmath26 characterized by the distribution function @xmath27 which is frequently chosen constant @xmath28 in the interval @xmath29 $ ] and zero otherwise .",
    "there is a vast literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) on numerical investigation of the anderson localization transition in this model on a 3d lattice .",
    "recently also higher dimensions @xmath30 become accessible to modern computers @xcite .",
    "while the earlier studies of this model were focused on the critical behavior of the localization / correlation length @xmath19 near the critical disorder @xmath31 , the recent works were mostly related with the statistics of critical eigenfunctions .",
    "the multifractality of critical eigenfunctions predicted in @xcite almost immediately after emergence of scaling theory of localization has been confirmed and quantified in detail .",
    "the results obtained for the anderson model exactly at the critical point seem to be very well described @xcite by the critical plbrm model @xcite .",
    "this model is defined as an ensemble of random hermitean matrices which entries @xmath32 fluctuate independently around zero with the variance : @xmath33 } , & i\\neq j\\cr \\end{matrix } \\right.,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 for the dyson orthogonal , unitary , and symlectic symmetry classes @xcite and @xmath35 is the parameter that controls the multifractality exponents .",
    "this model has been studied and its comparison with the anderson model in @xmath3 dimensions has been done predominantly for the statistical moments @xmath36 of _ a single _ eigenstate at a given energy @xmath37 : @xmath38 the best known example is the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) given by the second moment @xmath39 .",
    "the multifractal statistics of a single eigenstate is characterized by the moment @xmath40 that scales with the system volume @xmath41 or the total number of sites @xmath42 as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fractal dimension corresponding to @xmath45-th moment .",
    "the existence of the scaling law eq.([mf ] ) and the dependence of the exponent @xmath46 on @xmath45 are the principle features of _",
    "eigenfunction multifractality_. the fractal exponents @xmath46 depend also on the symmetry class @xmath47 and the space dimensionality @xmath3 . for the critical plbrm eq.([pl ] ) the dependence on @xmath3 is modeled by the dependence of @xmath46 on the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the critical scaling eq.([mf ] ) with respect to the system size @xmath42 has its _ dynamical _ counterpart when instead of one single eigenfunction one considers the correlation function eq.([c ] ) of _ two _ eigenfunctions at an energy separation @xmath2 between them .",
    "this scaling has been suggested by chalker @xcite many years ago : @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 is the mean level spacing and @xmath51 is the upper cut - off of multifractality .",
    "numerics on the integer quantum hall systems and in the critical point of the 3d anderson model was consistent @xcite with this scaling .",
    "an important feature of eq.([chanz ] ) is that the exponent @xmath52 in the @xmath8-dependence is smaller than 1 . even in the limit of infinitely small correlation dimension",
    "@xmath53 the correlation function decays slowly as @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that the sparse critical states separated by large energy distance are still well overlaping @xcite , in contrast to strongly localized states which typically do not overlap even for nearest neighbors in the energy space .",
    "the reason for such a behavior and the physical meaning of the energy scale @xmath51 will be discussed in section vi .    as the correlation function is equal to @xmath55 both for",
    "the truly extended and the ideal localized states , eq.([chanz ] ) implies the _ critical enhancement _ of eigenfunction correlations for @xmath56 .",
    "this enhancement is crucially important for electron interaction near the anderson localization transition , in particular for the superconducting transition temperature @xcite . to illustrate this point we present in fig.1 the result of numerical diagonalization of the critical plbrm , the classical wigner - dyson rm @xmath57 with extended eigenstates , and the ensemble of conventional banded random matrices @xcite with exponentially decreasing entries @xmath58 which describes strongly localized eigenstates in quasi-1d disordered systems .",
    "the critical enhancement of eigenfunction correlations is evident from this plot .",
    ", the banded random matrices with b=5 , and wigner - dyson rm are shown in red , blue and green , respectively , and are represented by squares ( n=200 ) , circles ( n=1000 ) and stars ( n=2000 ) . ,",
    "width=302,height=302 ]    the physical origin of the enhancement is two - fold : ( i ) a critical eigenfunction `` occupies '' only part of the available space which by normalization @xmath59 enhances its amplitude , and ( ii ) the supports ( the manifold of @xmath60 where @xmath61 is essentially non - zero ) of different critical eigenfunctions are strongly overlapping .",
    "it is important that both conditions are fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "for instance the condition ( i ) is fulfilled for localized states even better than for the critical ones but the lack of the condition ( ii ) levels off the gain in the correlation function @xmath23 . on the contrary , in a metal the condition ( ii ) is trivially fulfilled , but the eigenfunction amplitude is small .",
    "gaussian random matrix models proved to be an efficient and universal theoretical tool for describing complex systems .",
    "the success was partially due to the available analytical solutions @xcite and partially due to efficient algorithms of numerical diagonalization of matrices .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to have random matrix models that describe not only the critical mf eigenstates but also localized and extended eigenstates in the _ vicinity _ of the anderson transition .",
    "the criterion to select such models is a qualitative and ( when possible ) a quantitative agreement with the results on the 3d anderson model .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , the correlation function @xmath23 in the 3d anderson model contains the critical power - law behavior eq.([chanz ] ) well beyond the anderson transition point . as a matter of fact",
    "the correlation function @xmath23 is indistinguishable from the critical one until the dynamic length @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the mean dos ) exceeds the localization / correlation length @xmath19 . for @xmath64 , or @xmath8 smaller than the level spacing in the localized volume @xmath65",
    ", the correlation function loses its critical features and shows typical features of a metal or an isulator .",
    "this allows us to suggest the following cartoon of typical eigenfunctions in the vicinity of the localization transition shown in fig.2 .",
    "namely , a typical localized state in a _ `` multifractal insulator '' _ can be viewed as a `` piece of multifractal '' of the size of the localization radius @xmath19 ( fig.2b . ) , in contrast to a conventional localized state where all the localization volume is more of less homogeneously `` filled '' ( fig.2a . ) . in the same way , typical extended states on the metallic side of the localization transition ( _ `` multifractal metal '' _ ) should look like a mosaic made of such `` pieces of multifractal '' ( fig.2c . ) .    based on the persistence of the critical behavior beyond the critical region it is natural to assume that the random matrix model for the extended states near the critical point and the localized states on the other side of the transition should bear features of the critical rmt .",
    "is shown in each case.,width=18,height=37 ]    let us start by constructing a random matrix model for the multifractal insulator . given that the quasi-1d insulator is well described by the banded random matrices @xcite with exponentially decaying variance @xmath66",
    "we suggest the following hybrid rm model as a model for the multifractal insulator : @xmath67 as compared with the critical plbrm model eq.([pl ] ) , the model eq.([tran ] ) contains an additional parameter @xmath68 which sets in a finite localization radius @xmath69 .",
    "it also contains an exponent @xmath70 which depends on the space dimensionality @xmath3 of the disordered lattice model we would like to model by the rmt . in sec.viii",
    "we give both analytical and numerical arguments in favor of the choice @xmath71    another candidate has been suggested in ref.@xcite : @xmath72 } , & i\\neq j\\cr \\end{matrix } \\right.\\ ] ] in this case the localization radius @xmath19 is controlled by the variable exponent @xmath73 of the power - law . for a multifractal insulator @xmath74 .",
    "the possible rm models for multifractal metal are also constructed as deformations of the critical plbrm .",
    "the model eq.([alpha - ins ] ) for @xmath75 is believed @xcite to describe the multifractal metal .",
    "one can also think that the gaussian rmt @xmath76}+(b / b)^2 , & i\\neq j\\cr \\end{matrix } \\right.\\ ] ] which is a hybrid of the critical plbrm and the wd rmt , is also suitable for this purpose .",
    "below we will study all those rm models in detail and compare the corresponding results for the correlation function @xmath23 with the results obtained by numerical diagonalization of the @xmath3-dimensional anderson model .",
    "the characteristic properties of multifractal statistics of critical and off - critical states are best seen when the multifractality is strong .",
    "this is the case where the parameter @xmath77 in eqs.([pl ] , [ tran ] , [ alpha - ins ] , [ anti - trank ] ) is small . on the other hand",
    ", this is exactly the limit where the typical off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 are small compared to diagonal ones",
    ". such matrices ( referred to as _ almost diagonal _ random matrices ( adrm ) ) may possess a non - trivial statistics of eigenfunctions which justifies their special study @xcite .",
    "the idea of analytical treatment of adrm , first suggested in ref.@xcite and used in @xcite to compute the correlation dimension @xmath78 for the critical plbrm model eq.([pl ] ) , is similar to the virial expansion in dilute gases .",
    "however , instead of taking into account two- , three- and multiple - particle collisions , one considers progressively increasing number of interacting resonance sites coupled by a small off - diagonal matrix element @xmath32 .",
    "recently the virial coefficients for the gaussian adrm with an arbitrary ( but small ) variance @xmath79 were expressed through the supersymmetric field theory @xcite and the correlation function @xmath23 has been explicitly calculated in the two - state approximation for the _ unitary _ symmetry class @xmath80 . the result is the following : @xmath81 where @xmath82,\\ ] ] and @xmath83 in eqs.([k],[r ] ) we denote @xmath84 .    the result given by eqs.([k],[r ] ) is valid in the limit when : @xmath85 ) with @xmath74 which are suggested to describe the multifractal insulator , the sum over @xmath86 in eq.([cond])converges .",
    "then the validity of eqs.([k],[r ] ) is independent of the matrix size @xmath42 in the limit @xmath87 and is controlled only by a small parameter @xmath77 . on the contrary , for the models of the multifractal metal described by eq.([anti - trank ] ) and eq.([alpha - ins ] ) with @xmath75 the sum in eq.([cond ] ) diverges at large @xmath42 .",
    "then eqs.([k],[r ] ) are only valid for @xmath88 where we define the _ correlation radius _ @xmath19 as follows : @xmath89 we will show below that a good qualitative description of the metal phase in the limit @xmath87 can still be obtained from the above theory if one substitutes @xmath19 for @xmath42 in eqs.([k],[r ] ) .",
    "eqs.([k])-([xi ] ) will be used throughout the paper to analize different random matrix ensembles suggested as possible models for critical eigenstates and the off - critical states in a multifractal metal and insulator .",
    "it is not a priori clear that the critical power - law behavior eq.([chanz ] ) and the dynamical scaling relationship eq.([d - mu ] ) hold true for all systems where eq.([mf ] ) is valid . in particular",
    "it is interesting to study the correlation function eq.([c ] ) in the limit of strong multifractality when @xmath90 .",
    "below we will derive an _",
    "formula for the critical plbrm in the limit @xmath91 which corresponds @xcite to @xmath90 and confirm the scaling law eq.([d - mu ] ) by numerical diagonalization of plbrm with very small @xmath35 .",
    "one can easily see from eqs.([k])-([baro ] ) in which we plug in eq.([pl ] ) that in the interval @xmath92 ) with @xmath93 : @xmath94    applying eq.([cond ] ) to the critical plbrm eq.([pl ] ) gives the criterion of validity @xmath95 in which case one can not distinguish between @xmath96 and @xmath42 , or , correspondingly , between @xmath97 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus the analytical formulae eqs.([k],[pl ] ) is consistent with the scaling relationship eq.([d - mu ] ) , given that @xmath98 as @xmath91 .",
    "a comparison of the analytical results and the results of numerical diagonalization of the critical plbrm with @xmath80 and @xmath99 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the coincidence is very good for large energy separations .",
    "the deviation at small energy separations is due to the difference in the values of @xmath100 .",
    "the exponent @xmath93 for the analytical curve and @xmath101 for the numerical curve which is very close to the prediction of eq.([d - mu ] ) @xmath102 , where @xmath78 is found from the numerical data for @xmath103 and eq.([mf ] ) .",
    "the scaling relationship eq.([d - mu ] ) is further checked in fig.4 where the numerical data for @xmath100 and @xmath104 is plotted as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "the fulfillment of this relationship down to @xmath35 as small as 0.005 and an agreement with the theoretical prediction of ref.@xcite is spectacular .     for the critical plbrm with @xmath80 , @xmath99 and @xmath105(square),1000(circle ) and 2000 ( star ) . the analytical curve at @xmath106 given by eqs.([c - k]-[r ] ) is shown by a solid line.,width=340,height=340 ]     and @xmath78 for the @xmath80 critical plbrm .",

    "the energy difference @xmath2 is measured in units of mean level spacing .",
    "the insert shows the mean density of states ; the mobility edge corresponds to @xmath110 .",
    "the energies @xmath111 were taken from the window @xmath112 for the 3d anderson model and @xmath113 for the critical plbrm .",
    "the slope of the critical power - law eq.([chanz ] ) is 0.52 in both cases which corresponds to @xmath114.,width=340,height=340 ]    thus from the combination of analytical and numerical results we conclude that the chalker s scaling eqs.([chanz]),([d - mu ] ) is valid for arbitrary small @xmath35 and thus for arbitrary strong multifractality .",
    "finally we demonstrate how well the critical plbrm eq.([pl ] ) describes the two - eigenfunction correlations in the 3d anderson model at the mobility edge . to this end",
    "we modify the distribution of the on - site energies in the anderson model from the standard rectangular box distribution to the triangular distribution where the mobility edge corresponds to @xmath115 . the correlation function @xmath23 with @xmath111 near the mobility edge",
    "is shown in fig.5 .",
    "it coincides almost exactly with the corresponding curve resulting from numerical diagonalization of the critical plbrm ensemble with only one fitting parameter @xmath109 .",
    "results of both numerical and analytical calculation presented in fig.3 reveal another unexpected feature of eigenfunction correlation which appears to be common to all adrm .",
    "surprisingly it is also present for the 3d anderson model both in the metal and in the insulator phase ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "this is the _ negative _ eigenfuncton correlations for @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , one can see from fig.3 and fig.6 that for large enough @xmath8 the correlation function @xmath23 goes below the uncorrelated limit @xmath117 which corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the value of @xmath8 where this limit is reached . for @xmath119",
    "the correlation function @xmath120 decreases down to zero .    .",
    "points below the dotted line correspond to eigenfunction avoiding .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    such a behavior implies that two eigenfunctions separated by an energy difference @xmath119 try to _ avoid each other_. that is , if a site @xmath121 is occupied in one of the states it should be predominantly empty in the other .",
    "to explain such a behavior the following cartoon is useful .",
    "let us define a _ support _ of an eigenfunction as the manifold of sites @xmath122 where @xmath22 is essentially non - zero .",
    "to construct such a support starting from a given site @xmath121 with the on - site energy @xmath123 we find all the sites in resonance with the site @xmath121 , i.e. such sites @xmath124 which on - site energies @xmath125 obey the relationship @xmath126 .",
    "then the procedure should be repeated for all sites @xmath127 and so on .",
    "it is important that so obtained manifold @xmath60 does not always include all the sites of the system .",
    "if this is the case , the whole coordinate space is _ stratified _ into a set of mutually non - intersecting supports ( fig.7 ) .",
    "smaller that the single - shell bandwidth @xmath51 and mutual avoiding of eigenstates for @xmath119.,width=151,height=151 ]    once the support is defined , one can build a _",
    "shell _ of states on this support by making a linear combination of on - site states , pretty much in the same way as in building the conduction band states out of the on - site states in the tight - binding model .",
    "then by construction the eigenfunctions belonging to the same shell are well overlapping but those belonging to different shells do not overlap .    from this cartoon",
    "it is clear that the physical meaning of the scale @xmath51 is the width of the energy band corresponding to a single shell . indeed ,",
    "if the energy separation @xmath8 greatly exceeds the typical single shell bandwidth , the two eigenfunctions must belong to different shells and thus do not significantly overlap in space . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath8 is smaller than the single shell bandwidth , the two states typically belong to the same shell and thus overlap strongly no matter how sparse the shell support .",
    "the new energy scale @xmath51 , which is the upper energy cut - off of the multifractal correlations , corresponds to a new length scale @xmath128 which has a meaning of the minimum length scale of the fractal texture . in the @xmath3-dimensional anderson model",
    "the energy scale @xmath51 can be estimated as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the total bandwidth . estimating the dos as @xmath131 we find @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the lattice constant .",
    "clearly the picture with a stratified coordinate space is possible for plbrm eq.([pl ] ) with small enough @xmath134 when the single shell bandwidth @xmath135 is small compared to the total bandwidth @xmath136 .",
    "amazingly , the 3d anderson model which low - frequency critical features are well described by the critical plbrm with @xmath137 , also follows the predictions of the critical plbrm for high frequencies @xmath119 .",
    "this is a consequence of a relatively large value @xmath138 of the critical disorder which results in @xmath51 considerably smaller than the conduction bandwidth @xmath130 . in particular its coordinate",
    "space must be stratified to explain the observed ( see fig.6 ) mutual avoiding of eigenstates .",

    "the inverse participation ratio is equal to 0.23 and 0.46 , respectively.,width=302,height=302 ]    as has been demonstrated in sec.v critical eigenfunctions with @xmath140 are strongly correlated in space .",
    "here we consider the case of multifractal insulator where the localization radius @xmath19 is large compared to relevant microscopic lengths ( the lattice constant or elastic scattering length ) but is much smaller than the system size @xmath141 .",
    "we will identify a suitable random matrix model to describe this case and compare the properties of eigenfunction correlation in this model with those of the 3d anderson model .",
    "we start by considering a limit of strong disorder when the localization length @xmath142 and the multifractal nature of eigenstates does not show up .",
    "a common wisdom is that in the strongly localized regime the positions of the localization centers are completely uncorrelated .",
    "as it is shown in the introduction , this leads to @xmath143 which we will refer to as the _ ideal insulator limit_. fig.1 shows how this limit is reached in the ensemble of banded random matrices .",

    "the absence of this factor at @xmath204 explains the qualitative difference between the case @xmath204 ( see fig.8 ) and @xmath256 ( see fig.9 ) .",

    "the slope decreases with increasing @xmath35 and at a sufficiently large @xmath35 may become smaller than the critical one .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at small @xmath325 and @xmath35 this happens at @xmath326 .",

    "thus the sub - critical plbrm shows exactly the same character of eigenfunction correlations as in the 3d anderson metal ( see fig.17 ) .",
    "two parameters of the sub - critical plbrm allow to simulate the effect of the finite correlation length ( choice of @xmath75 ) and the dimensionality of space ( choice of @xmath35 ) .",

    "this can be modeled by a decreasing parameter @xmath35 .",
    "then the analogy with the sub - critical plbrm suggests that for sufficiently high dimensions @xmath336 the behavior in the @xmath3-dimensional anderson model should become similar to the one in fig.18a .",
    "namely , the exponent @xmath100 in eq.([d - mu ] ) may become _ larger than 1_.",
    "this changes qualitatively the eigenfunction correlations , as they become effectively short - range in the energy space .",
    "in particular , the return probability @xcite which is proportional to the fourier transform of @xmath23 behaves in the time interval @xmath337 as @xmath338 for @xmath339 and is a constant for @xmath340 .",
    "we believe that this qualitative change in the eigenfunction statistics ( if confirmed for a @xmath3-dimensional anderson model with @xmath336 ) should lead to dramatic physical consequences marking a transition to a new metallic state .",
    "in conclusion we list the main results obtained above .",
    "the most important of them is the persistence  beyond the point of localization transition of the critical power - law in the dependence of the eigenfunction correlation function @xmath23 on the energy separation @xmath8 and the related enhancement of @xmath23 at @xmath341 , where @xmath184 is the mean level spacing in the localization / correlation volume and @xmath51 is the upper energy cut - off of multifractality .",
    "this enhancement leads to an enhancement of matrix elements of local electron interaction which may result in , e.g. an enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature in the vicinity of the anderson localization transition @xcite .",
    "another important observation is that the enhancement of correlations at @xmath342 is always accompanied by the depression at @xmath343 , both phenomena being the consequences of the stratification of the coordinate space into mutually avoiding supports of the fractal structure with well overlapping eigenfunctions living on each of them .",
    "an independent  but also important phenomenon is the logarithmic enhancement of @xmath23 in the 2d and 3d anderson insulator at @xmath283 ( and the absence of such enhancement in the quasi-1d disordered wire ) . it is a result of a competition of two simultaneous phenomena : the repulsion of centers of localization and the resonance enhancement of the eigenfunction overlap by tails .",
    "both phenomena are studied quantitatively within the truncated critical random matrix model which is suggested as a universal tool to describe the localized eigenfunctions with a multifractal texture .",
    "we also show that the sub - critical power - law banded random matrix ensemble suggested in ref.@xcite describes the multifractal metal reasonably well . from the analytical solution for this rmt",
    "we conclude that a critical dimensionality @xmath344 may exist above which the @xmath3-dimensional anderson model has an unusual metal phase characterized by an effectively short - range correlation function @xmath345 with @xmath346 .",

    "<S> we consider the correlation of two single - particle probability densities @xmath0 at coinciding points @xmath1 as a function of the energy separation @xmath2 for disordered tight - binding lattice models ( the anderson models ) and certain random matrix ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the parameter range close but not exactly at the anderson localization transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even away from the critical point the eigenfunction statistics exhibit the remnant of multifractality characteristic of the critical states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an enhancement of eigenfunction correlations and a corresponding enhancement of matrix elements of the local electron interaction at small energy separations . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is accompanied by a depression of correlations at large energy separations , both phenomena being a consequence of the stratification of space into densely packed but mutually avoiding resonance clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the correlation function of localized states in a @xmath3-dimensional insulator is logarithmically enhanced at small energy separations provided that @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple and general physical picture of all these phenomena is presented .    finally by a combination of numerical results on the anderson model and analytical and numerical results for the relevant random matrix theories we identified the gaussian random matrix ensembles that describe the multifractal features both in the metal and in the insulator phases . </S>"
