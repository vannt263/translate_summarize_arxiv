    "the problem of random walks ( rws ) on complex networks have attracted much attention as a model to study diffusion processes on complex systems such as fad or disease spreading over social networks , data packets transport in the internet , data mining on the web , and so on @xcite .",
    "such importance in theoretical and application aspects has led to the extensive studies on the problem @xcite , but it still remains unclear how rw properties depend on network structure . in this paper , we investigate the effect of shortcut links on rw motion .",
    "shortcuts may be classified into two types : long - range shortcuts , utilized in a skeleton or superhighways , and local shortcuts , complementary to the skeleton or local roads @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown systematically @xcite that long - range shortcuts can change the type of networks from fractal to non - fractal . the fractal ( non - fractal ) network is the one in which the mean separation between two nodes scales with system size in a power - law ( logarithmic ) manner .",
    "we are particularly interested in how rw properties are changed as long - range shortcuts are added and thereby the network changes from a fractal to a non - fractal network .",
    "the gaussian model is useful to study rw problems analytically  @xcite , which we use to understand the rw motion on hierarchical scale - free networks @xcite . in this artificial network",
    ", we can control the degree distribution and the link weight of shortcuts .",
    "we consider rws on this hierarchical network , and obtain the exact solution of the return - to - origin ( rto ) probability by applying the renormalization group ( rg ) approach to the gaussian model .",
    "the rto probability is related to the free energy of the gaussian model and the spectral density function of the laplacian matrix , all of which are characterized by the spectral dimension @xmath2 @xcite . the hierarchical network is recursively organized , so that one can obtain analytically the spectral density function by using the decimation method of the rg transformation .",
    "we find that when the network structure is a fractal , the spectral dimension @xmath2 varies in the range @xmath3 ; however , it is fixed at @xmath4 for the non - fractal networks .",
    "these analytic results are confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , we perform the numerical simulations of rws on various real - world networks and check the relationship between the network fractality and the spectral dimension .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : modelformalism ] , the hierarchical network model and the formalism to derive the spectral density function of the laplacian matrix from the gaussian model is briefly introduced along with their relation to the rto probability of rws . in section  [ sec : rg ] , we apply the rg approach to the gaussian model and obtain the spectral density function explicitly . in section  [ sec :",
    "simulation ] , numerical results of the rto probability are presented and compared with the analytic solutions . we summarize our findings and discuss their implications in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the network we use in the paper is a modified version of an existing hierarchical network model @xcite , in which shortcuts are assigned weights .",
    "we call this modified model the _ weighted flower _ ( wf ) network .",
    "the wf network contains two types of links , type i and ii , which evolve differently .",
    "the wf network is constructed iteratively as follows .",
    "we start from a single type - i link between two nodes , which is the 0-th generation . at the next generation , two chains are added between the two nodes at both ends of the type - i link . on one chain , @xmath5 nodes are located and thereby @xmath6 links are placed . on the other chain , @xmath7 nodes are located and thereby @xmath8 links are placed .",
    "those @xmath9 links are assigned as type - i links , and the type of the seed link is changed to type ii .",
    "these steps - adding nodes and links and assigning link types - are performed at every generation .",
    "every link is assigned weight : @xmath0 for each type - i link and @xmath10 for each type - ii link .",
    "the link weights will be used for the transition rate of rwers .",
    "the growth of the wf network with @xmath11 and @xmath12 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ( a ) .",
    "we consider only the case @xmath13 and @xmath14 throughout this paper .",
    "the type - ii links play a role as shortcuts in the system and the parameter @xmath10 represents the transition rate across a type - ii link .",
    "we point out that in the previous model of the hierarchical network @xcite , the parameter @xmath10 was used as the occupation probability of the type - ii links , but here , it is used as the weight of the type - ii links .",
    "thus , the two network models are equivalent if @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise , they are different .     and @xmath12 from generation @xmath17 to @xmath18 . type - i links ( solid line ) and type - ii links ( dotted line ) have link weight @xmath0 and @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "the upper chain has @xmath5 @xmath19 variables and the lower chain has @xmath7 @xmath19 variables .",

    "this result demonstrates that shortcuts strongly affect the rw motion even when the shortcut weight is small .",
    "it was shown that the organization of shortcuts in a network was essential in the classification of network structures  @xcite .",

    "if the decay of @xmath209 is slower than @xmath211 with @xmath36 being the fractal dimension of the network , the network is renormalized to the complete graph .",
    "otherwise , the network is renormalized to the corresponding fractal network . in the non - fractal wf networks",
    ", we obtain that @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is in the range between @xmath214 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the hierarchical networks with shortcuts belong to the former case , which can be related to our finding that the spectral dimension @xmath2 is robust against the variation of @xmath6 or @xmath8 in the @xmath142 regime .",
    "we performed the numerical simulations of rws on the following real - world complex networks : the protein interactions network of the yeast  @xcite , the human protein interaction network  @xcite , the coauthorship network of the cond - mat archive  @xcite , and the internet at the autonomous system level  @xcite . among them , the two protein interaction networks are known as fractals and both the coauthorship network and the internet are non - fractals @xcite .",
    "the spectral dimensions obtained from the power - law decay of the rto probabilities turned out to be larger for non - fractal networks than fractal networks .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath2 were approximately @xmath215 and @xmath1 for the yeast and the human protein interaction network , respectively , and @xmath216 and @xmath217 for the coauthorship network and the internet , respectively .",
    "the probability @xmath131 that a rwer will ever return to the origin is related to the rto probability as @xmath218 and thus rws are recurrent ( transient ) if @xmath219  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the structure of the hierarchical networks with shortcuts studied in this work , having @xmath4 , is marginal in the rw motion ; rwers can never return to the origin if the network structure is more entangled .",
    "it would be interesting to see the case of the internet .",
    "since the spectral dimension is larger than @xmath1 for the internet , packets roaming on the internet may not return to its origin or a destination if they follow the rw motion .",
    "therefore the studied hierarchical network could be a good sample for the construction of the internet .",
