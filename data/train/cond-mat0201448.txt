    "a sharp peak in the angular resolved photoemission spectrum of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bscco ) is the major subject of this paper @xcite .",
    "this peak emerges from an incoherent background at temperatures somewhat higher than @xmath3 and persists all the way down to @xmath4 .",
    "it is located around @xmath5 ( in the units of inverse lattice spacing ) in the brillouin zone .",
    "substantial efforts have been invested into uncovering the nature of this peak .",
    "it was assumed that this might provide us with an important clue about a mechanism of the superconducting state . in this paper",
    "we will argue that the peak is a consequence of normal state phenomenology .",
    "our method will enable us to explain qualitatively the most salient features of the peak behavior .",
    "unlike overdoped cuprates , it is believed that for the underdoped materials the normal state single - particle green s function can be qualitatively characterized by the presence of the pseudogap  a depletion of the spectral density @xmath6 near @xmath7 for @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath0 point of the brillouin zone close to the fermi surface ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "the origin of the pseudogap is unclear at the moment . yet",
    ", our method does not require such knowledge .",
    "the causality puts some constraints on the green s function : its real part can be found according to the kramers transformation @xcite .",
    "then , for any reasonable choice of `` pseudogapped '' @xmath9 the function @xmath10 has two maxima located approximately at the edges of the pseudogap ( fig.1a ) .",
    "we will show that those maxima are responsible for the emergence of the ` quasiparticles ' in the superconducting state .",
    "there are several microscopical theories which explain the emergence of the peak below @xmath3 @xcite . in the approach presented by j.e .",
    "hirsch charge carriers ( holes ) are coupled to a bosonic bath .",
    "if this coupling weakens with the growth of the local hole concentration the superconducting pairing driven by the kinetic energy occurs : the kinetic energy benefits from the effective reduction of the boson - hole coupling .",
    "another consequence of this boson - hole decoupling is the increase of the quasiparticle peak weight . in the paper by m. eschrig _",
    "a model of the electrons interacting with a magnetic resonance has been discussed .",
    "it is claimed that this model reproduces correctly the most salient features of the photoemission spectrum .",
    "this paper was a development of a previous work by m. norman , h. ding and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the latter is important to us since it has some similarities with the present approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors concentrated their attention on a step - like feature in the electron self - energy which could explain the shape of the spectrum . in order to account for such a feature they postulated the existence of a collective mode below @xmath3",
    "this mode has to disappear above @xmath3 for the model predictions to be consistent with the data .",
    "it is believed that this mode and the magnetic resonance mentioned above are the same entity .",
    "many - body investigation of the phenomenon was undertaken by e. carlson _ et .",
    "they assume that in the cuprate materials phase separation takes place .",
    "it leads to the formation of stripes with every stripe being 1d metallic conductor . using bosonization",
    "the authors demonstrated that below @xmath3 the single - particle spectral density develops a delta - function peak at the superconducting gap energy .",
    "in contrast to these studies , we will deduce this peak without resorting to microscopical considerations .",
    "it will be shown that the peak in the single - particle spectral density is a consequence of the analytical structure of the normal state green s function .",
    "in this part of the paper we will calculate the spectral density in the superconducting state . let us derive first an auxiliary relation between the green s function of an electron and a hole .",
    "the spin - up electron retarded propagator is : @xmath11 the propagator for a spin - up hole : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the unitary rotation operator .",
    "it rotates the spin of the electron by @xmath14 around @xmath15 axis : @xmath16 and @xmath17 the ground state is invariant under the action of @xmath13 . after performing fourier transformation for the last equality one arrives at : @xmath18",
    "assume now that the system at hand is in the normal state but not far from the superconducting transition .",
    "its retarded green s function in nambu representation can be written as : @xmath19 in this form it describes independent propagation of an electron and a hole .",
    "spatial inversion symmetry guarantees that @xmath20 .",
    "this function @xmath21 satisfies dyson s equation : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the retarded self - energy in the normal state : @xmath24 next , we change , let s say , doping and drive the system superconducting .",
    "new green s function @xmath25 satisfies an equation similar to ( [ dysonn ] ) with new self - energy @xmath26 where @xmath27 given by : @xmath28 here the relation @xmath29 between two off - diagonal elements of the nambu self - energy has been used .",
    "it follows from an equation @xmath30 for anomalous propagators which , in turn , can be obtained along the same lines as ( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "the point of this derivation is to establish the analytical structure of the self - energy in the superconducting state .",
    "this will be used in our discussion of a sum rule .    combining the above equations one gets for @xmath25 the expression : @xmath31",
    "the equations derived in the previous section are completely general . in order to proceed",
    "further we need to make a simplifying assumption : near the fermi surface electronic @xmath32 and hole @xmath33 parts of the spectral function are symmetric for small @xmath34 .",
    "one can express that as : @xmath35 for @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the size of the pseudogap .",
    "exact particle - hole symmetry is absent in the cuprates .",
    "we would like to argue , however , that ( [ symm ] ) holds at least approximately for @xmath8 close to the fermi surface .",
    "firstly , the tunneling data @xcite shows that the pseudogap is symmetric with respect to voltage polarity change .",
    "one might think that this tells little about validity of ( [ symm ] ) since the tunneling differential conductance measures @xmath38-integrated spectral density .",
    "however , ding _",
    "( inset of fig.1b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) demonstrated that scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) spectrum multiplied by the fermi distribution function at appropriate temperature coincides with the angular - resolved spectral density at @xmath39 .",
    "this means that stm spectrum equal to @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "it is natural to expect that the spectral density coincide with the stm conductivity for @xmath42 as well .",
    "thus , the symmetry of the stm data suggests the symmetry of the photoemission spectrum .",
    "although , it is not our goal to construct a theory of tunneling into cuprates we may speculate that this agreement between the tunneling conductance and the photoemission spectrum is not a coincidence but a consequence of the inter - plane hopping matrix element @xmath8-dependence : as discussed before @xcite the inter - plane hopping matrix element is at its maximum for the electrons with a momentum parallel to @xmath5 and it is vanishes along brillouin zone diagonal .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that the most of the tunneling current is carried by the electrons near @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , we would like to direct our attention toward the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter paper",
    "the angular resolved spectrum at @xmath43 was analyzed with the help of a momentum distribution sum rule .",
    "theoretically , it was proved that an expression @xmath44 has to be temperature independent provided that ( [ symm ] ) is true for small @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this expression can be easily extracted from the data since it is proportional to the integral over @xmath45 of the photoemission spectrum .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath8 near @xmath5 was integrated , and the integral showed no dependence on the temperature , supporting the assumption of the symmetry .",
    "finally , we would like to mention two other papers @xcite where ( [ symm ] ) was assumed to be true .",
    "thus , we believe we have enough evidence to treat ( [ symm ] ) as a reasonable approximation for small @xmath34 .",
    "the structure of the background for @xmath46 is of little interest to us since the positions of @xmath47 maxima are insensitive to the background . for the purpose of simplicity",
    "we will assume that the background is also symmetric .",
    "that is , ( [ symm ] ) is true for any @xmath45 .",
    "in such a case green s function satisfies @xmath48 .",
    "a consequence of the symmetry is a constraint on the self - energy in the superconducting phase : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a real number and the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfy the following : @xmath53 in terms of these functions the superconducting spectral density equals to : @xmath54 let us simplify this equation .",
    "if the system is close to the transition point then @xmath27 is small and the denominator of ( [ asg ] ) is close to unity everywhere except the edges of the pseudogap . at those points as one",
    "can see from fig.1a @xmath55 is big and one should be more careful .",
    "if we are away from the brillouin zone diagonal where @xmath52 is zero then to the second order in @xmath52 and to the first order in @xmath56 we find that the denominator is equal to @xmath57 . in this expression",
    "the terms like @xmath58 have been dropped .",
    "although , they are of the order of @xmath59 we presume that they are smaller than @xmath60 since the latter is proportional to the second power of @xmath61 which is big at the pseudogap edges .",
    "this gives for the spectral function : @xmath62 where we omit @xmath63 term in the numerator assuming that it is small compare to @xmath64 .",
    "the last formula is the key to understanding the appearance of the ` quasiparticles ' below @xmath3 . at the edges of the pseudogap",
    "@xmath55 peaks up , the denominator gets smaller and the spectral function develops a sharp maximum .",
    "this is true provided that @xmath65 is positive at the edges of the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "now we would like to analyze ( [ asg ] ) and ( [ as ] ) to obtain simple properties of the ` quasiparticles ' which can be compared against the experiment .",
    "first , it is clear that the position of the peak in the frequency domain is determined by the pseudogap edge .",
    "therefore , we expect to see strong correlation between the size of the pseudogap and the frequency ( binding energy ) position of the peak . this is precisely the effect reported in @xcite where temperature dependence of the peak frequency was compared against that of the pseudogap size .",
    "fig.2c of that paper shows that the peak position traces the size of the pseudogap .",
    "similar phenomena is seen for the peak dispersion ( binding energy vs. @xmath8 ) . as reported in @xcite",
    "the pseudogap at @xmath5 is virtually @xmath8-independent .",
    "this is consistent with the weak dispersion of the peak itself @xcite .    in order to obtain the shape of the spectral function at @xmath66 we performed simple numerical study .",
    "we modeled @xmath67 and @xmath68 as @xmath69 the energy @xmath70 determines how abrupt the edges of the pseudogap , @xmath71 mimics the bandwidth . the constant",
    "@xmath72 has to be determined from the sum rule @xcite : @xmath73 the parameter @xmath74 describes the frequency dependence of the anomalous self - energy .",
    "it is commonly put equal to infinity .",
    "this makes the anomalous self - energy frequency independent .",
    "below we will discuss both cases of finite and infinite @xmath74 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath52 and the real part of the green s function can be found with the help of numerical kramers transformation",
    ". then the spectral function in the superconducting state is determined using ( [ asg ] ) .",
    "the resultant spectra for different parameter values are presented on fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "these two figures correspond to different values of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 for fig.2 and @xmath76 for fig.3 ) . on each figure",
    "the top ( bottom ) row corresponds to @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 in the left ( right ) column is 0.3 ( 0.1 ) .",
    "we see clear ` dip - and - hump ' structure of the spectrum for big values of @xmath52 .",
    "when this quantity is small we find only a tiny bump or even a kink instead of a well - developed peak .",
    "such situation seems to be realized in pb - doped bsco compound @xcite .",
    "this angular resolved photoemission study revealed no peak in the spectrum ( fig.3 , right panel of the latter reference ) .",
    "authors claim that their energy resolution is high enough to observe the peak should it be present in the spectrum .    by comparing different spectra from fig.2 and 3",
    "we can discuss the dependence of the spectrum shape on the model parameters .",
    "two parameters which affect the spectrum the most are @xmath80 and @xmath79 .",
    "the effect of @xmath52 is obvious : the bigger the anomalous self - energy the higher the peak .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 regulates the height of the peaks of @xmath81 .",
    "this height is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the smaller this ratio the higher the peak in the superconducting spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath74 specifies roughly the position of the hump . for @xmath83",
    "the hump is absent from the spectrum ",
    "it is moved to infinite frequency .",
    "another interesting property of our superconducting state spectrum is its compliance with the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) .",
    "mathematical proof of this fact is given in appendix .",
    "visually , one can notice from figures 2 and 3 that the depletion of the spectral weight in the dip is roughly compensated by its enhancement at the hump .",
    "experimentally , however , it is seen that the weight from the dip goes into the peak .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the lack of exact knowledge about @xmath84 .",
    "particular , we are unable to identify any first principal based constraint which would provide us with any information about @xmath51 . to keep our consideration as simple as possible we chose to put @xmath51 equal to zero .",
    "as we stressed the equality ( [ symm ] ) is only an approximation .",
    "thus , an interesting question worth discussing is how deviations from ( [ symm ] ) affect the peak in the superconducting state . to address this issue we model the electron spectral function as @xmath85 where @xmath9 is given by ( [ model ] ) . in this case",
    "the pseudogap for electrons is bigger then the pseudogap for holes by the amount of @xmath86 .",
    "the spectral function can be found according to @xmath87 the resulting function for @xmath88 and @xmath89 is plotted on fig.4 . as one can see the only effect of the asymmetry is uneven hight of the peaks for positive and negative frequencies .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear if one notice that ( [ aseh ] ) may be approximated in the manner similar to ( [ as ] ) : @xmath90 in order to demonstrate the quality of this approximation we plotted this expression on fig.4 .",
    "the denominator in ( [ asehapp ] ) is symmetric with respect to the frequency sign change .",
    "it has two minima located approximately at @xmath91 . since @xmath92 the peak at @xmath41 is smaller .",
    "it is now clear that the superconducting state spectrum is rather robust with respect to small deviations from ( [ symm ] ) .    to understand why the peak appears at the temperatures higher than @xmath3 it is enough to imagine that in the cuprates there is a temperature window @xmath93 where the phase coherence exists over some finite time scale @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "experimental evidence of this was produced by @xcite .",
    "speaking more technically , in this temperature window one can use ( [ sigma ] ) with non - zero @xmath52 and fixed @xmath50 to describe the single - particle dynamics on the time scale less than @xmath96 . for time periods bigger than @xmath96 the dynamics of the phase @xmath50 can not be neglected anymore .",
    "if @xmath96 is big enough one can simply average the propagator over the phase fluctuations .",
    "for infinitely long time the anomalous propagator always vanishes above @xmath3 due to the phase dynamics .",
    "however , the peak in the photoemission spectrum does not vanish since , as it follows from ( [ asg ] ) , it is independent of @xmath50 .",
    "we study the ` quasiparticle ' peak in the superconducting state of the underdoped bscco .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that the peak can be explained on the basis of the normal state phenomenology .",
    "our analysis is based on three premises .",
    "first , we assume that the single particle spectrum has a pseudogap ( fig.1b ) . the most important consequence of that is the peaks of the function @xmath97 at the edges of the pseudogap .",
    "next , we assume that there is approximate symmetry between positive - frequency and negative - frequency parts of the spectrum ( [ symm ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that the function @xmath98 has only one maximum at @xmath41 .",
    "we also shown that some violation of ( [ symm ] ) is not fatal for the qualitative structure of the superconducting state spectrum .",
    "finally , there is the third assumption we made implicitly : the single - particle anomalous self - energy @xmath99 does not go to zero at the edges of the pseudogap . if @xmath52 does go to zero then the peak in the superconducting phase could be completely suppressed ( see ( [ as ] ) ) .    in order to explain the emergence of the peak at @xmath100 we accepted another postulate .",
    "it was agreed that ( [ sigma ] ) local order parameter is established and it is permissible to use ( [ sigma ] ) with fluctuating @xmath50 to describe the single - particle dynamics above @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that the peak can be derived from the normal state properties suggests that it is not a fundamental object .",
    "moreover , depending on the circumstances it may be absent or replaced by a less prominent feature @xcite .",
    "it is also can be surmised that this phenomena may not be limited to the cuprate superconductors only .",
    "the peak could be present in the superconducting state of any material which has a pseudogap in the normal state .",
    "we did not try to fit any experimental data by our curves from fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "it is not possible owing to the lack of knowledge about exact form of functions ( [ model ] ) .",
    "we also have no independent information about the values of @xmath101 .",
    "another argument against feasibility of the spectrum fit is a problem with the experimental data themselves .",
    "it is known that the photoemission spectrum is a convolution of the single - electron green s function and a photoemission matrix element .",
    "it has been assumed that this matrix element is a constant , at least in a relevant range of parameters .",
    "thus , relative intensities of different features of the spectrum were believed to be free of any influence extrinsic to the electron dynamics .",
    "however , it was shown recently that the matrix element has very non - trivial dependence on the photon energy and the binding energy of the photoelectrons @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the significance of an intensity fit is substantially devaluated .",
    "to conclude , we study the peak in the photoemission spectrum of bscco . it was shown that this peak is a consequence of the normal state pseudogap .",
    "we derived the most basic properties of the peak and demonstrated that they are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data available .",
    "author is most grateful to d. basov , a.j .",
    "millis and j.e .",
    "hirsch for help and discussions .",
    "in this appendix we will prove that under rather mild assumptions on @xmath64 and @xmath52 the spectral function ( [ asg ] ) satisfies ( [ sumrule ] ) . in our derivation",
    "we will assume that @xmath102 .",
    "this limitation is not crucial .",
    "an essential part of our proof is the analyticity of both @xmath103 and @xmath99 for complex values of @xmath104 ( upper half - plane ) .",
    "first , we establish asymptotical behavior of @xmath64 at large @xmath34 . if @xmath105 the details of the spectral function @xmath106 are irrelevant and it can be viewed as a delta function times @xmath107 .",
    "this means that at large @xmath108 @xmath109 we see , that due to the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) the residue of @xmath64 at infinity is exactly unity .",
    "next , for any finite @xmath74 the same reasoning can be applied to @xmath52 with the result : @xmath110 for large @xmath34 .",
    "we do not try to determine the residue of @xmath52 at intinity since it is of no interst to us . the asymptotical behavior combined with the absence of any singularity in the upper half - plane of complex",
    "@xmath45 implies that both @xmath64 and @xmath52 are bounded : @xmath111 provided that the product @xmath112 .",
    "this inequality guarantees that the denominator of @xmath113 never goes to zero .",
    "therefore , the integrand of ( [ sumrule2 ] ) has no singularities for @xmath114 .",
    "this means that we can transform the integration contour into a semi - circle in the upper half - plane .",
    "the integral over the semi - circle of infinite radius equals to the residue at infinity times @xmath115 .",
    "we already know that this residue is unity for @xmath64 .",
    "it is also unity for @xmath116 : at large @xmath34 the denominator is non - singular and approaches 1 , thus , the leading asymptotic behavior of @xmath116 is the same as that of @xmath64 .",
    "the residue of the integrand is zero which proves ( [ sumrule2 ] ) .",
