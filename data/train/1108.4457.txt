    "in the presently known three - flavor framework of neutrinos , the flavor eigenstate is a mixture of mass eigenstates :    @xmath8 the 3@xmath43 unitary mixing matrix , @xmath9 , is known as the maki - nakagawa - sataka ( mns ) mass matrix@xcite .",
    "it has 6 independent parameters : 2 square mass differences ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , 3 mixing angles ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) , and 1 cp - violating phase ( @xmath15 ) . among these parameters ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath12 were determined through solar@xcite and reactor@xcite neutrino oscillation experiments :    @xmath16    on the other hand , @xmath11 and @xmath13 were measured through atmospheric@xcite and long - baseline@xcite neutrino - oscillation experiments :    @xmath17    the remaining parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are unknown .    the oscillation parameter @xmath14 can be determined by studying the following transition probability :    @xmath18    two different types of experiments can be performed to determine non - zero @xmath14 .",
    "one is the @xmath1 disappearance experiment using @xmath193mev @xmath20 from reactors with baseline distance of a few kilometers . at present , the upper limit on @xmath7 is known to be 0.15 , as reported from the chooz@xcite reactor experiment .",
    "the other type of experiment is the @xmath1 appearance experiment using an almost pure @xmath19gev @xmath21 beam from accelerators with more than hundreds kilometer long baseline . from the minos@xcite experiment ,",
    "it was reported that @xmath22 .",
    "t2k ( tokai to kamioka)@xcite is a new long - baseline neutrino - oscillation experiment in japan .",
    "a high - intensity neutrino beam from the j - parc main ring is shot toward the super - kamiokande ( sk ) detector , 295  km away .",
    "it is claimed @xcite that the t2k experiment is sensitive for @xmath23 in 90% c.l .",
    "a schematic view of the t2k neutrino beamline and detector components are shown in fig.[fig : concept ] .",
    "details on the beamline and the detector components have been comprehensively discussed in @xcite . in this article , some of the important features are presented below .    a schematic view of the t2k neutrino beamline and detectors .",
    "beamline components are indicated by the words in red , and the detectors are indicated by words in blue . ]",
    "the proton beam for the t2k experiment is extracted from the j - parc 30-gev main ring proton synchrotron .",
    "this beam is delivered to the target station where it strikes the carbon target , resulting in the production of pions and kaons ; the pions and kaons are bent toward the direction of sk by a magnetic field produced by magnetic horns .",
    "neutrinos are produced as decay products of pions and kaons .",
    "all particles except neutrinos and high - energy ( @xmath24 5  gev ) muons are absorbed by a beam dump located 110  m downstream of the target .",
    "the most important feature of the t2k neutrino beamline is the off - axis beam , which was originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "the details of the concept of the off - axis angle in t2k have been reported in @xcite .",
    "when the beamline construction was started , the off - axis angle was tunable@xcite because the optimum off - axis angle was unknown .",
    "the value of @xmath11 from other experiments@xcite was considered , and the off - axis angle was accordingly adjusted to be 2.5@xmath25 in 2007 .",
    "the corresponding peak energy of the neutrino flux is approximately 600  mev , and the oscillation study is the most sensitive around @xmath26 .",
    "two types of muon monitors are installed downstream of the beam dump : the ionization chamber and the semiconductor array .",
    "they can measure the intensity distribution of muons that escape from the beam dump .",
    "since these muons are mainly produced along with neutrinos from the @xmath27 decays , the beam center of muons is in accordance with the beam center of neutrinos .",
    "the position of the beam center can be monitored on a bunch - by - bunch basis , within a 3-cm resolution , from the peak of the muon intensity distribution .",
    "this position resolution corresponds to a 0.25-mrad accuracy of beam direction .",
    "the near detectors were constructed in the underground experimental hall at a depth of 33.5  m , with a diameter of 17.5  m , and 280  m downstream from the target .",
    "two detectors were installed : the on - axis detector in the direction of the neutrino beam center and the off - axis detector in the direction of sk .",
    "the on - axis detector , referred to as the ingrid detector , consists of 16 1m@xmath41m@xmath41 m cubic modules , as shown in fig.[fig : near ]  ( left ) .",
    "each module is a 134 sandwich \" of 11 scintillator layers and 10 iron layers .",
    "they are surrounded by 4 veto planes .",
    "the modules are arranged in such a way that seven are horizontally aligned , seven are vertically aligned , and two are placed in an off - diagonal fashion .",
    "the neutrino beam center can be measured from the horizontal / vertical distribution of the neutrino event rate .",
    "the off - axis detector is named nd280 .",
    "the purposes of the nd280 detector are    * measurement of the energy spectrum of muon neutrinos in the sk direction , * measurement of fraction of electron neutrinos , and * study of neutrino interactions , especially , neutral current @xmath28 , which is background for the @xmath1 appearance signal .    a schematic view of the nd280 detector is shown in fig.[fig : near ]  ( right ) .",
    "all the detector components except smrd are placed inside a 0.2  t magnetic field produced by the recycled ua1 magnet from cern .",
    "the pi zero detector ( p0d ) is a subdetector component placed in the upstream inside the magnet .",
    "it is a 134 sandwich \" of a water target , scintillator planes , and lead plates .",
    "it is customized for measurement of neutral @xmath28 production .",
    "@xmath29-rays from @xmath30 are converted to electromagnetic showers using lead plates and are detected by scintillators .",
    "three time projection chambers ( tpcs ) and 2 fine grained detectors ( fgds ) are placed downstream of the p0d .",
    "the tpcs can measure the momentum of muons from the curvature of the muon track in the magnetic field .",
    "the momentum resolution is better than 10% at 1  gev .",
    "fgds consist of scintillator bars .",
    "they provide the target material for neutrino interactions and are optimized for detecting the proton recoils . by combining the tpcs and fgds , the energy spectrum of @xmath21 can be precisely measured from charged current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) neutrino interactions .",
    "other detector components , side muon range detector ( smrd ) and electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) are installed surrounding the p0d and tpc / fgd .",
    "they are reported in detail in @xcite .      the far detector , sk is a 50-kton water cherenkov detector@xcite . it is located underground at a depth of 1000  m at the kamioka mine , japan .",
    "the distance of sk from j - parc is 295  km . in the inner detector ( i d ) , 22.5  kton fiducial volume",
    "is viewed using 11129 20-inch diameter pmts .",
    "the outer detector ( od ) , surrounding the i d , is also a water cherenkov detector .",
    "it is used to veto particles that enter or exit the i d .",
    "sk started its operations in april 1996 .",
    "after an accident involving pmts in 2001 , it was fully recovered by june 2006 .",
    "the most important characteristic of sk as the far detector of the t2k experiment is its particle identification capability between muons and electrons .",
    "this particle identification directly relates to identification between parent @xmath21 and @xmath1 .",
    "the principles of particle identification have been reported in @xcite .",
    "it was verified that the @xmath31/@xmath32 misidentification probability is less than 1%@xcite .",

    "the first proton beam was delivered to the target station on april 23 , 2009 .",
    "generation of neutrinos was confirmed by the signal of the muon monitors . the first neutrino event in ingrid",
    "was detected on november 22 , 2009 .",
    "the physics data collection started in january 2010 , and the first neutrino event in sk was observed on february 24 , 2010 .",
    "the history of proton beam delivery is shown in fig.[fig : beamhistory ] .",
    "the beam duration of the t2k beam is @xmath195  @xmath31s . in early 2010 ,",
    "the beam cycle was 3.52  s , and each pulse contained 6 bunches .",
    "this was changed to a beam cycle of 3.04  s , and 8 bunches per pulse in order to increase the beam power .",
    "the number of protons per pulse ( ppp ) was improved from @xmath33  ppp to @xmath34  ppp .",
    "the last beam power corresponds to about 150  kw . this value is about 1/5 of the design value , 750  kw . we have accumulated 1.43@xmath410@xmath35 protons on target ( pot ) until march 11 , 2011 .",
    "this is about 2% of our goal , i.e. , @xmath3610@xmath35 pot , which can be attained by the beam operation for 5  years with 750  kw .",
    "the stability of the beam direction is continuously monitored using the muon monitors ( fig.[fig : mumoncenter ] ) and the ingrid detector ( fig.[fig : ingrid - data ] ) .",
    "the beam direction is stable and well controlled within an accuracy of @xmath21  mrad .",
    "note that if the beam direction is changed by 1  mrad , the neutrino flux at sk is changed by 2% at @xmath37gev .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the beam direction is satisfactory .",
    "the possible @xmath1 appearance signal was searched for using the 1.43@xmath410@xmath35 pot data@xcite .",
