    "1 . the four sites of the v atoms forming the tetrahedron are orbitally inequivalent as v1 and v2 atoms have different orbital occupancies . the magnetic transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic ( afm )",
    "is also observed at lower temperature.@xcite    among the above mentioned three compounds the structural transition temperature ( @xmath7 ) is highest ( @xmath297 k ) for cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 and lowest ( @xmath250 k ) for znv@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite on the other hand the afm transition temperature ( @xmath8 ) is lowest ( @xmath235 k ) for cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 and highest ( @xmath242 k ) for mgv@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite the frustration index , defined as @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13@xmath11/@xmath8 where @xmath12@xmath13 is the curie - weiss temperature and @xmath8 is the afm transition temperature , is considered as a measure of the activeness of geometrical frustration.@xcite the values of @xmath9 for cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 , mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 , and znv@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds are found to be about 11.4 , 14.3 , and 21.3 , respectively , suggesting that the geometrical frustration is least active in cdv@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite the pressure dependent magnetization studies on cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 and znv@xmath0o@xmath1 have been carried out by canosa _ et al . _ and found opposite trends for the @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 and znv@xmath0o@xmath1 , respectively , increases and decreases with increase in pressure.@xcite these contrasting behaviours in this series of compounds are unusual and yet to be understood .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 is a relatively simple compound where the effect of spin fluctuations due to geometrical frustration is expected to be minimal .",
    "thus cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 would be a good starting candidate to study the complex physical properties of the above compounds using density functional theory ( dft ) , which is a mean - field theory .",
    "here we employ the dft based _ ab inito _ electronic structure calculations to study the pressure dependent electronic and magnetic properties of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 compound . the coulomb correlation among v",
    "3@xmath14 electrons are found to be important in understanding its structural and electronic properties .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is weak and total magnetic moment of the v ion comes out to be @xmath21.3 @xmath3 which is closer to the experimental value of @xmath21.2 @xmath3 .",
    "it shows orbital ordered ground state where @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are mainly occupied at the neighboring v sites .",
    "the electronic states of the compound evolves from orbital - ordered - insulator to orbital - ordered - metal to orbital - disordered - metal with increasing pressure .",
    "the broadening of lower and upper hubbard bands due to increasing pressure is found to be responsible for the pressure induced metal - insulator transition .",
    "the present mean - field calculations correctly describe the pressure dependent shift of @xmath8 indicating the applicability of such approach in understanding the magnetic properties of similar systems .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and afm calculations of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 have been carried out by using _ state - of - the - art _ full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method.@xcite in the afm solution the directions of spins of v1 and v2 atoms shown in fig .",

    "the initial axis of magnetization was set along the @xmath4-axis and convergent solution was obtained in presence of soc , which corresponds to a non - collinear magnetism .",
    "the consideration of soc in the calculation is very time consuming , therefore for this solution the energy convergence criterion was set to be smaller than 10@xmath18 hartree / cell .",
    "the energy vs volume plots of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 obtained from fm and afm gga+@xmath15 calculations are show in fig .",
    "2 . both the curves show almost parabolic behaviour and the volume corresponds to minimum energy is found to be around 1092 bohr@xmath19 .",
    "the energy of afm solution is always found to be less than that of fm solution suggesting the afm ground state of the compound for the range of unit cell volumes studied here .",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm phase increases with decrease in volume .",
    "thus decrease in volume gives rise to more stability to the afm phase in comparison to fm phase . in order to know the exact equilibrium volume of the compound we fitted the energy - volume data by using equation of states formula of vinett _",
    "et al._@xcite the equilibrium volumes thus obtained correspond to fm and afm solutions are 1096.6 and 1093.1 bohr@xmath19 , respectively , which are about 1% and 1.3% less than the experimental value of 1108.2 bohr@xmath19 at 85 k.@xcite the bulk moduli of the compound found for fm and afm solutions are @xmath2180.8 and @xmath2170.7 gpa which is about 0.4 times less than the bulk modulus of diamond . for @xmath15=5 ev the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus of the ground state afm phase is found to be about 1098.4 bohr@xmath19 and 175.5 gpa , respectively , suggesting that the increased value of @xmath15 does not have much influence on its structural properties .",
    "the present calculated value of the bulk modulus is about 20 gpa more than that reported earlier and obtained from the use of hybrid functional.@xcite    the partial density of states ( pdos ) of cd 4@xmath14 , v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 states obtained from fm gga+@xmath15 solution corresponding to equilibrium volume are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the valance band can be divided in three regions : ( i ) region a from 0 to -2.0 ev , ( ii ) region b from -2.2 to -7.8 ev and ( iii ) region c below -7.8 ev .",
    "regions a and c are dominated by v 3@xmath14 and cd 4@xmath14 states , respectively , whereas region b has similar contribution from all the three atoms .",
    "the shape of cd 4@xmath14 , v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 pdos are similar in all the regions suggesting the hybridization between cd 4@xmath14 , v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 orbitals .",
    "the lowest lying conduction bands , denoted by 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , have dominating contribution from v 3@xmath14 states .",
    "there is a finite gap between regions a and b which can be attributed to the gap between bonding and antibonding bands arising due to finite overlap of v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 orbitals .",
    "the band gap of @xmath20.3 ev is essentially arising due to correlation induced splitting of v 3@xmath14 bands in lower and upper hubbard bands putting this compound into the category of mott - hubbard insulator .    in order to know the exact magnetic moment ( mm ) of the v ion we have included soc in the calculation and obtained the fm solution .",
    "the spin part of mm at the v site is found to be about 1.6 @xmath3 and directed along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the total spin only mm is found to be 2 @xmath3 per formula unit ( fu ) suggesting that effectively v ion is in @xmath21=1 spin state as expected for 3 + ionic state of the v in this compound .",
    "the orbital moment is mainly lying in the @xmath22-plane .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath4 components of the orbital moment ( @xmath24 ) are found to be about -0.1 and -0.2 respectively where negative sign indicates the direction of the moment . since the direction of the spin moment ( @xmath21 ) is mainly along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "thus the total moment ( @xmath16 ) also lies in the @xmath22-plane .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath4 components of @xmath16 are found to be about -0.1 and 0.6 .",
    "using these values of @xmath24 , @xmath21 and @xmath16 one can estimate the magnitude and direction of total magnetic moment of v ions .",
    "the magnitude comes out to be @xmath21.3 @xmath3 , which is in good agreement with the experimental value of about 1.2 @xmath3.@xcite the total magnetic moment is making an angle of @xmath29.5 degree with the @xmath4-axis . here",
    "it is important to note that there is a large difference between the calculated and experimentally observed mm of mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 compound and this behaviour has been attributed to the activeness of geometrical frustration responsible for quantum fluctuations.@xcite however , the small difference of 0.1 @xmath3 between the calculated and experimental mm for cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 suggests that the geometrical frustration may be less important for understanding its magnetic properties .",
    "this observation can further be justified by comparing the frustration index @xmath9 of both the compounds .",
    "the values of @xmath9 for cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 and mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 have been reported to be 11.4 and 14.3 , respectively@xcite suggesting that geometrical frustration is less active in the cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "finally one should keep in mind that the dft is a mean - field theory and effect of quantum fluctuations can not be studied using this technique .",
    "therefore , in the geometrically frustrated system the difference between the experimental and calculated magnetic moment is expected ; and it can be directly related to the @xmath9 .",
    "since the value of @xmath9 for mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 is greater than that of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 , therefore the difference between the experimental and calculated magnetic moment for mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 is expected to be more in comparison to cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 as mentioned above .",
    "the electronic occupancy of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) orbital for two vanadium atoms v1 and v2 forming the tetrahedron ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is found to be about 0.79 and 0.06 ( 0.06 and 0.79 ) , respectively .",
    "the occupancies of rest of three v 3@xmath14 orbitals are same at each v sites .",
    "this result clearly shows the orbital ordered ground state for the cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 compound where @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are mainly occupied at v1 and v2 sites of the tetrahedron .",
    "here it is important to note that the afm solution does not have much influence on the orbital ordering and solely arising due to tetragonal structure of the compound .    the evolution of electronic structure of the compound with increasing pressure is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where we have plotted total density of states ( tdos ) per formula unit ( fu ) obtained from afm solutions at different pressure . one can notice couple of obvious changes in the tdos with varying pressure . with increasing pressure cd 4@xmath14 states are becoming deeper in energy .",
    "the gap between regions a and b enhances with increasing pressure suggesting the increased energy difference between the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals mainly consist of v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 atomic orbitals .",
    "this behaviour is as per the expectation because increasing pressure increases the overlap between v 3@xmath14 and o 2@xmath20 atomic orbitals and the energy difference between bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals is proportional to the overlap between the atomic orbitals .",
    "with increase in pressure the band gap decreases from @xmath20.5 to @xmath20.27 ev at 16.6 gpa as conduction band ( cb ) 1 comes closer to the valance band ( vb ) .",
    "the gap almost vanishes at 34.5 gpa as the maximum of vb and minimum of cb 1 merges with each other as evident from fig .",
    "4(c ) . on further increase of pressure",
    "the vb and cb 1 started overlapping and such overlap of vb and cb may lead to metallic conductivity above 34.5 gpa .",
    "the tdos / fu at the fermi level increases from @xmath21 states / ev at 87.5 gpa to @xmath22 at 105.5 gpa enhancing the conductivity by 2 times .",
    "dispersion relations along high symmetric directions of the brillouin zone for 0.23 and 34.5 gpa are shown in fig .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "5(a ) that the valance band maximum and conduction band minimum lie at the @xmath25 point and @xmath26 point , respectively .",
    "the energy difference between these two points gives the indirect band gap of @xmath20.5 ev , which is responsible for the insulating behaviour of the compound .",
    "when pressure is increased to 34.5 gpa the energy difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 points becomes almost zero .",
    "this suggests the pressure induced insulator to metal transition above 34.5 gpa .",
    "the increase in pressure brings v atoms closer resulting in increased overlap between v 3@xmath14 orbitals .",
    "this finally leads to broadening of upper and lower hubbard bands giving rise to reduced separation between them which is responsible for the decrement in the gap with increasing pressure .",
    "thus present work clearly indicates the pressure induced metal - insulator transition in the compound due to broadening of upper and lower hubbard bands .    to study the effect of pressure on the orbital ordering we have plotted the pressure dependent electronic occupancies of v @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals at v1 sites obtained from afm solutions in fig .",
    "the degree of orbital polarization at v1 sites can be defined as @xmath27 = ( @xmath5-@xmath6)/(@xmath5+@xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath27 = 1 corresponds to 100% orbital polarization as only @xmath5 orbital is occupied at v1 sites .",
    "needless to say that this situation automatically tells about 100% orbital polarization at v2 sites where only @xmath6 orbital is occupied .",
    "@xmath27 = 0 corresponds to orbital disordered state as same kind of orbitals will be occupied at every sites .",
    "the occupancies of both the orbitals show almost linear pressure dependence in the insulating region and non - linear pressure dependence in the metallic region .",
    "the occupancy of @xmath5 continuously decreases with increase in pressure .",
    "the pressure dependent occupancy of @xmath6 orbital shows non - monotonous behaviour .",
    "it decreases in the insulating region and increases in the metallic region .",
    "the @xmath27 also shows non - monotonous pressure dependence . in the insulating",
    "phase the value of @xmath27 increases slowly from @xmath20.46 at 0 gpa to @xmath20.52 at 34.5 gpa .",
    "however , the decrement of @xmath27 is fast in the metallic phase as its value reduces from @xmath20.51 at 71.6 gpa to @xmath20.32 at 105.5 gpa .",
    "this result suggests the complete melting of the orbital ordering at higher pressure .",
    "thus , the present work clearly shows the interesting pressure evolution of the electronic state of cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 from orbital - ordered - insulator to orbital - ordered - metal and then to orbital - disordered - metal with increasing pressure in the tetragonal structure .    as opposed to the electronic state , the magnetic state of the compound",
    "is found to be robust with increasing pressure as the mm of the v ion remains almost the same even at 105.5 gpa . in order to know the effect of pressure on the magnetic transition temperature we have plotted the heisenberg exchange parameter @xmath16 of neighbouring v ions as a function of pressure in fig .",
    "the pressure dependence values of @xmath16 have been estimated by mapping of energies of fm and afm solutions to the heisenberg hamiltonian and assuming that only neighbouring v ions have strong magnetic interactions . keeping the localized nature of v 3@xmath14 orbitals in mind",
    "it may be considered as a fairly good approximation .",
    "the @xmath16 shows almost linear pressure dependence and it increases with increasing pressure indicating the enhanced exchange interaction strength due to increased overlap of v 3@xmath14 orbitals .",
    "if we scale the @xmath16 with experimental @xmath8 then @xmath16 at zero pressure is equivalent to @xmath8 at zero pressure . using",
    "this scaling one can plot the pressure dependence of @xmath8@xmath28/@xmath8@xmath29 .",
    "for the direct comparison with the experimental data shown in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "16 , we have shown the interpolated value of @xmath8@xmath28/@xmath8@xmath29 up to 10 kbar in the inset of fig . 7 .",
    "our result shows about 2.5% increase in @xmath8 per gpa ( i.e. 10 kbar ) of pressure which is closer to the experimental observation.@xcite keeping the complex nature of magnetic transition in mind where spin fluctuations due to geometrical frustrated can not be fully ignored , the applicability of such a simple mean - field approach in understanding the pressure dependent shift in the @xmath8 is quite interesting and demands further investigation to such similar systems .",
    "the effect of pressure on the electronic and magnetic properties of tetragonal cdv@xmath0o@xmath1 have been studied by using gga+@xmath15 formulation of the density functional theory .",
    "the present study shows the importance of on - site coulomb interaction among the v 3@xmath14 electrons in deriving the insulating ground state of the compound . the spin - orbit coupling is weak and responsible for titling the total magnetic moment ( @xmath21.3 @xmath3 ) of the v ion by @xmath29.5 degree with the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are found to be mainly occupied at neighboring v sites .",
    "the electronic structure of the compound shows interesting evolution from orbital - ordered - insulator to orbital - ordered - metal to orbital - disordered - metal with increasing pressure .",
    "the pressure induced metal - insulator transition is essentially arising due to broadening of lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the present work clearly demonstrate the applicability of the mean - field theory in understanding the pressure dependent behaviour of the magnetic transition temperature in similar geometrically frustrated systems",
