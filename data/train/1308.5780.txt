    "optical microresonators play an important role in modern day physics , for example , enabling study of cavity quantum electrodynamic phenomena , tailoring of spontaneous emission spectra of atoms and quantum dots , spectral filtering and development of novel light sources @xcite .",
    "combination of optical microresonators with metallic nanoparticles ( nps ) supporting localised surface plasmons ( lsps ) has also recently attracted much attention , due to the opportunities it affords in efficient light routing , field confinement and enhanced spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "one further field of importance is that of whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) biosensing where large reactive coupling to dielectric particles , such as bacteria and proteins , results in detectable wgm frequency shifts @xcite . in the drive for single molecule sensitivity , enhancement of reactive shifts and maximisation of near field intensities",
    "are , however , necessary @xcite such that plasmonic nps are being increasingly employed as either analyte labels @xcite or near field nanoantennae @xcite .",
    "sensitivity enhancements specifically derive from the increased polarisability of nps and generation of plasmonic hotspots , which are maximum when operating at wavelengths close to the lsp resonance of the np . near resonance , however , scattering and absorption losses are also increased such that resonance quality is degraded hence countering potential sensitivity gains . a balance must hence be struck . in this article",
    "we therefore consider the hitherto overlooked phenomena of level repulsion and level crossings in np coupled high @xmath0 microresonators , arising from reactive and resistive coupling contributions , which in turn allows optimal np configurations to be identified . whilst we consider the case of core - shell nps coupled to spherical whispering gallery mode resonators ( wgmrs ) for simplicity , the underlying physical principles are common to all resonator geometries and are hence applicable in a broader sense .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "hybridisation ] we derive and discuss the hybridisation of photonic and lsp resonant modes , whereby we demonstrate both level repulsion and crossing .",
    "we proceed in section  [ sec : biosensing ] to consider the consequences of this mode hybridisation within the context of wgm biosensing , in turn allowing the optimal np geometry to be found , as is dictated by the detuning of the wgm and lsp resonances .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "resonances in isolated microcavities have been well studied in the literature @xcite and in all cases can be cast into a secular equation : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an appropriate system matrix .",
    "energy can , in general , escape from the resonator ( e.g. via radiation and absorption losses ) , such that @xmath2 is non - hermitian and the associated eigenvalues ( and hence resonance frequencies ) are complex .",
    "for example , for spherical microresonators @xmath2 is a diagonal matrix with non - zero elements given by @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 are the well known mie scattering coefficients for transverse electric ( te , @xmath5 ) or magnetic ( tm , @xmath6 ) mie modes with polar and azimuthal mode indices @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "accordingly the secular equation decouples in @xmath8 and @xmath9 to yield the more familiar transcendental equation ( which is independent of @xmath9 ) : @xmath10^\\prime } {     h_l(n_i z ) } = n \\frac{\\big[n_{ii } z \\ , j_l(n_{ii } z)\\big]^\\prime } {     j_l(n_{ii } z ) } , \\label{eq : mierestrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 or @xmath12 for te or tm modes respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spherical bessel and hankel functions of the first kind , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the ( complex ) vacuum wavenumber , @xmath17 is the resonator radius , prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument of the respective hankel or bessel function and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the refractive index of the surrounding medium ( resonator ) .",
    "it should be noted that eq .   is conventionally found by directly considering when the denominator of @xmath20 is zero . whilst many solutions to eq .   can be found , here we will primarily be interested in bound surface modes , i.e. wgms , for which @xmath21 \\sim l / n_{ii}$ ] @xcite .",
    "plasmonic resonances in metallic nps have similarly seen extensive research in the literature .",
    "small ( @xmath22 ) homogeneous nps , for instance , are often described using a ( complex ) polarisability given by the clausius - mossotti relation , such that lsp resonance occurs when the frhlich condition is satisfied @xcite ( as again follows by considering when the denominator of the polarisability is zero ) .",
    "this treatment is , however , only approximate and breaks down for larger , or inhomogenous , nps due to retardation effects and field non - uniformity . more generally , the exact polarisability , @xmath23 , of a ( possibly inhomogenous ) spherical np can be found using generalised mie theory , or the @xmath24-matrix method @xcite viz .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the electric dipole element of the @xmath24-matrix and @xmath27 is the electric permittivity of the medium surrounding the np @xcite .",
    "for homogeneous nps @xmath28 , whilst for core - shell nps @xmath29 ( as defined in appendix c of @xcite ) . evidently , the methodology adopted to determine lsp resonances in metallic nps is formally , and physically , equivalent to that used for determining resonances in large microcavities . when considering more general resonator and np geometries , similar arguments",
    "can also be made , albeit the form of @xmath2 becomes more complicated and separability in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( or analogous mode indices ) is likely lost .    when a np is coupled to a microcavity the mode structure of the combined system is modified , yielding hybrid photonic - plasmonic modes with resonance frequencies shifted from the bare resonator case .",
    "hybrid resonances , can again be found by solution of the equation @xmath1 , albeit coupling terms must be incorporated into @xmath2 . in earlier work",
    ", we have derived the appropriate system matrix describing coupling of arbitrary nps to spherical wgmrs @xcite , whereupon resonance conditions were found for hybridisation of the electric dipole lsp resonance in a np with the te and tm wgms . restricting attention , henceforth , to a core - shell np the resonance conditions are ( approximately ) given by @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 or @xmath32 are the translation coefficients for tm and te modes respectively , which arise when relating fields from displaced scatterers . in the absence of coupling , eq .",
    "reduces to the resonance conditions for the isolated wgmr ( @xmath33 ) and np ( @xmath34 ) as discussed above , whilst the coupling ( embodied in @xmath35 ) represents a perturbation to these conditions . it must be emphasised that symmetry dictates that the quantisation ( polar ) axis is defined along the line joining the wgmr and np centers , hence avoiding coupling between azimuthal modes .",
    "realistically , the broad lsp resonance spectrally overlaps with multiple polar modes ( of both high and low @xmath0 ) within the wgmr , a point neglected in the derivation of eq .  .",
    "upon inclusion of this effect , the resonance conditions can be written in the form : @xmath36 the real and imaginary parts of the complex roots of eqs .   and define the resonance frequency and line - width of the hybrid modes ( here termed `` quasi - tm '' and `` quasi - te '' ) respectively . noting that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 , it is evident that only the low order azimuthal modes hybridise , whilst higher order azimuthal modes remain unperturbed .",
    "physically this is a consequence of higher order modes having zero intensity at the site of the np .    greater insight into eq .",
    "can be gained by considering the case when the lsp peak lies spectrally close to the wgm resonance of polar index @xmath41 , as can be practically realised using the tunability of core - shell nps @xcite . near resonance",

    "strong extinction is not seen on the lsp branches since we assume the lsp is only excited through leakage from the wgmr . from figure",
    "[ fig : crossing ] it can be seen that for larger detunings the wgm and lsp modes are mutually repelled , however at small detunings the repulsion effect diminishes , the wgm resonance broadens due to increased scattering and absorption losses arising from stronger ( resistive ) coupling to the np , and ultimately the resonance branches cross .",
    "an optimal np core - shell ratio can hence be identified whereby reactive resonance shifts are maximised , as shall be determined analytically in what follows .",
    "wgm based sensors operate by what has become known as the reactive sensing principle @xcite .",
    "specifically , the spectral position of a wgm resonance is shifted when a molecule enters the near field of the wgmr , by an amount proportional to the polarisability of the particle .",
    "typical shifts of wgm resonances in biosensing experiments are , however , on the femtometer scale , such that the shift of the @xmath80 wgm mode depicted in figure  [ fig : crossing ] is comparatively large .",
    "however , due to the choice of polar axis , excitation of a fundamental wgm , commonly used for sensing and considered as a single mode , must be represented by a superposition of degenerate azimuthal modes @xcite . since only the low order azimuthal modes are perturbed ( hence lifting the degeneracy ) the total extinction spectrum is formed by superposition of @xmath81 unshifted resonances ( @xmath82 or @xmath83 for quasi - tm and -te modes respectively ) with @xmath84 shifted modes viz . @xmath85 here a lorentzian mode profile has again been adopted and the dependence of each quantity on @xmath53 is again suppressed .",

    "summation over @xmath8 in eq .",

    "states that the optimal wgm resonance shifts are obtained when the lsp of the np is detuned by half the line - width of the lsp .",

    "the maximum possible resonance shift is seen to decrease with increasing @xmath41 ( and hence increasing wgmr radius ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : illum_coeffs ] which plots the ratio @xmath79 . since the line - width of wgm resonances ,",

    "splitting is hence only observable for a restricted range of np sizes and is not predicted in this work .",
    "given that the treatment detailed in this article is largely mathematical , it is important to give a more quantitative estimate of the enhancement of the resonance shifts that may be expected in a typical experiment .",
    "assuming a silica - silver core - shell np of 55  nm outer radius , we estimate that at the optimal detuning an approximate 90-fold enhancement of the wgm resonance shift can be obtained , as compared to the wgm shift resulting from perturbation by a dielectric sphere of the same dimensions and with a refractive index of 1.5 .",
    "use of a gold shell np reduces the obtainable enhancement to @xmath144 due to a lower quality lsp resonance . noting that the maximum near field enhancement ( as defined in @xcite ) arising from a plasmonic np scales as the square of the polarisability @xcite , we estimate an enhancement factor of @xmath145 for both gold and silver .",
