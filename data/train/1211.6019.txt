    "our goal in this series of papers ( see  @xcite ) is to obtain a uniform construction of tensor products of one - column kirillov ",

    "we shall prove the equality @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the macdonald polynomial @xmath3 specialized at @xmath0 and @xmath4 is the graded character of a simple lie algebra coming from tensor products of kr modules .",
    "both the macdonald polynomials and kr modules are of arbitrary untwisted affine type .",
    "the index @xmath5 is a dominant weight for the simple lie subalgebra obtained by removing the affine node .",
    "macdonald polynomials and characters of kr modules have been studied extensively in connection with various fields such as statistical mechanics and integrable systems , representation theory of coxeter groups and lie algebras ( and their quantized analogues given by hecke algebras and quantized universal enveloping algebras ) , geometry of singularities of schubert varieties , and combinatorics .",
    "our point of departure is a theorem of ion  @xcite , which asserts that the nonsymmetric macdonald polynomials at @xmath0 are characters of demazure submodules of highest weight modules over affine algebras .",
    "this holds for the langlands duals of untwisted affine root systems ( and type @xmath6 in the case of nonsymmetric koornwinder polynomials ) .",
    "our results apply to the untwisted affine root systems .",
    "the overlapping cases are the simply - laced affine root systems @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    it is known  @xcite that certain affine demazure characters ( including those for the simply - laced affine root systems ) can be expressed in terms of kr crystals , which motivates the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for types",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath12 , the equality @xmath13 was achieved in  @xcite by establishing a combinatorial formula for the macdonald polynomials at @xmath0 from the ram  yip formula  @xcite , and by using explicit models for the one - column kr crystals  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , in types @xmath7 and @xmath12 , the one - column kr modules are irreducible when restricted to the canonical simple lie subalgebra , while in general this is not the case . for the cases considered by ion  @xcite , the corresponding kr crystals are perfect .",
    "this is not necessarily true for the untwisted affine root systems considered in this work , especially for the untwisted non - simply - laced affine root systems .    in this work",
    "we provide a type - free approach to the equality @xmath13 for untwisted affine root systems .",
    "lenart s specialization  @xcite of the ram  yip formula for macdonald polynomials uses the quantum alcove model @xcite , whose objects are paths in the quantum bruhat graph ( qbg ) , which was defined and studied in @xcite in relation to the quantum cohomology of the flag variety .",

    "seshadri ( ls ) paths to the classical weight lattice .",
    "hence we need to establish a bijection between the quantum alcove model and projected level - zero ls paths .    in analogy with @xcite and",
    "inspired by the quantum schubert calculus of homogeneous spaces @xcite we define the parabolic quantum bruhat graph ( pqbg ) , which is a directed graph structure on parabolic quotients of the weyl group with respect to a parabolic subgroup .",
    "we construct two lifts of the pqbg .",
    "first lift _ is from the pqbg to the bruhat order of the affine weyl group .",
    "this is a parabolic analogue of the lift of the qbg to the affine bruhat order @xcite , which is the combinatorial structure underlying peterson s theorem @xcite ; the latter equates the gromov - witten invariants of finite - dimensional homogeneous spaces with the pontryagin homology structure constants of schubert varieties in the affine grassmannian .",
    "we obtain diamond lemmas for the pqbg via projection of the standard diamond lemmas for the affine weyl group .",
    "we find a _",
    "second lift _ of the pqbg into a poset of littelmann  @xcite for level - zero weights and characterize its local structure ( such as cover relations ) in terms of the pqbg .",
    "littelmann s poset was defined in connection with ls paths for arbitrary ( not necessarily dominant ) weights , but the local structure was not previously known .",
    "the weight poset precisely controls the combinatorics of the level - zero ls paths and therefore their classical projections , which we formulate directly as quantum ls paths .",
    "finally , we describe a bijection between the quantum alcove model and the quantum ls paths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s2 ] we prepare the background and define the pqbg .",
    "section  [ s3 ] is reserved for the two lifts of the pqbg and the statement of the diamond lemmas . in section  [ s4 ]",
    "we describe kr crystals in terms of the quantum ls paths and the quantum alcove model in @xcite ; we also give simple combinatorial formulas for the energy function .",
