    "most of the analyses of cp - violating effects in @xmath0 decays deal with quark - diagram short - distance ( sd ) amplitudes and assume that final state interactions ( fsi ) are negligible . on the other hand , it has been argued that this neglect is not justified , and that any reliable analysis of @xmath12 decays ( @xmath13 - pseudoscalar mesons ) must take rescattering into account @xcite . while only small effects of rescattering through low - lying intermediate states are generally expected , the sequence @xmath14 with _",
    "inelastic _ multiparticle intermediate states @xmath15 might in principle lead to important corrections @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the size of such inelastic effects are model - dependent , with the contributions from different intermediate states either cancelling in an approximate way , or having random phases @xcite , or even adding coherently @xcite .    with our insufficient knowledge of @xmath16 interactions at @xmath17 ,",
    "there is virtually no hope that the rescattering effects may be reliably calculated . under the circumstances it seems appropriate to use symmetry - based approaches and to parametrize the rescattering in terms of a few fsi - related parameters .",
    "such an approach has been recently studied in ref.@xcite , where su(3 ) symmetry was used to reduce our ignorance of the inelastic rescattering to a small set of effective su(3 ) parameters jointly describing all @xmath18 processes . in the present paper",
    "we limit the considerations of ref.@xcite to the case when the rescattering amplitudes satisfy zweig rule .",
    "short - distance decay amplitudes lead to @xmath19 states which convert to hadron - level two - body states composed of various mesons @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( including the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "transitions to many - body states occur when the @xmath24 states radiate off further quark - antiquark pairs and gluons leading to the decays of @xmath25 . in order to estimate the rescattering through such many - body states",
    ", we use unitarity to replace the sum over these states with the contribution from @xmath25 themselves : @xmath26 as in ref.@xcite , we restrict our study to the case when fsi ( now zweig - rule - satisfying ) are su(3)-symmetric .",
    "consequently , for the intermediate @xmath27 states it is appropriate to use the basis in which a pair of mesons @xmath27 ( in most cases , heavy ) forms a state belonging to a definite su(3 ) multiplet . in ref.@xcite the amplitudes for the short - distance - driven decay of a @xmath0 meson into such states are expressed in terms of standard sd diagram amplitudes @xmath28 ( tree ) , @xmath29 ( color suppressed ) , @xmath30 ( penguin ) , @xmath31 ( exchange ) , @xmath32 ( annihilation ) , @xmath33 ( penguin annihilation ) , @xmath34 ( singlet penguin ) , @xmath35 ( double singlet penguin ) . as usual ,",
    "strangeness - conserving @xmath36 ( strangeness - violating @xmath37 ) processes are denoted by unprimed ( primed ) amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes may be thought to incorporate the electroweak penguin contributions according to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "let us first recapitulate the essential assumption of ref.@xcite , which permits parametrization of all fsi effects in terms of a few parameters only .",
    "namely , since at the sd level it is not yet decided whether the particular quark - level state will hadronize as the @xmath16 state or one of the heavier @xmath27 states , one expects that quark - level sd amplitudes for @xmath0 decays into two arbitrary mesons @xmath27 are proportional to the corresponding amplitudes of sd decay into two pseudoscalar mesons @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality may depend on the type of mesons in the @xmath27 state ( ie . whether @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are vector , axial , tensor , etc . ) , but - by virtue of the su(3 ) symmetry - it must be the same for all @xmath20 , @xmath21 within given su(3 ) multiplets . consequently",
    ", this coefficient may be absorbed into the fsi amplitude for the process @xmath43 , whose size , due to our ignorance , must be again treated as a free parameter . in other words , @xmath44-type amplitudes used for sd @xmath45 decays are normalized to their sd @xmath46 counterparts .",
    "this justifies the use of the same letter @xmath47 for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and similarly for other types of diagrams .",
    "( a part of the analysis of this paper would go through also if coefficients of proportionality between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 amplitudes depended on the type of diagram , ie . if they were different for tree , penguin , etc .",
    "since this introduces additional parameters , we do not consider this possibility further on . )",
    "when the rescattering contributions from all intermediate @xmath27 states are added , they are gathered into a few groups differing in their su(3 ) symmetry structure . for each such group ,",
    "the su(3 ) structure is factorized and then the remaining sum of unknown free parameters is replaced with a single parameter , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath45 , calculated in @xcite , are given here in tables [ table27 ] , [ table8 ] and [ table1 ] ( in a normalization adjusted to that used normally for @xmath46 ) . from these tables",
    "the amplitude of , say , a @xmath50 decay into a pair of two mesons @xmath27 in an overall antisymmetric octet state and of total isospin @xmath51 may be read of from the column marked @xmath52 to be @xmath53 .",
