    "a generalized eilenberg  mac  lane space ( gem ) is a space weakly equivalent to a product of eilenberg ",

    "the goal of this note is to prove the following characterization of gems :    [ main ] let @xmath3 be a commutative ring with a unit and let @xmath4 be the category of finitely generated free @xmath5-modules . if @xmath6 is a functor such that    * @xmath7 is a contractible space , * @xmath8 is connected and for every @xmath9 the projections @xmath10 induce a weak equivalence @xmath11    then the space @xmath12 is weakly equivalent to a product @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an @xmath15-module .    by @xmath16 above and in the rest of this paper we denote the category of simplicial sets .",
    "consequently , by space we always mean an object of this category .",
    "the above description of gems is modeled after the @xmath0-space structure introduced by segal in @xcite to characterize infinite loop spaces .",
    "just as for infinite loop spaces one gets the following corollary which is implicitly present in the work of bousfield  @xcite and dror  @xcite who apply it to localization functors .    if @xmath17 is a functor preserving weak equivalences and preserving products up to weak equivalence then @xmath18 preserves gems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the grothendieck construction on a diagram of small categories",
    "is recalled and some of its properties are stated . in section 3",
    "we give a description suitable for our purposes of @xmath19  the infinite symmetric product on a space @xmath20 . in section 4",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main ] is presented .",
    "it essentially amounts to showing that for a functor @xmath21 satisfying the assumptions of the theorem the space @xmath22 is a homotopy retract of @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 is a gem and the class of gems is closed under homotopy retractions the claim of the theorem will follow .",
    "i am indebted to w. g. dwyer for suggesting the topic of this work to me and for many discussions .",
    "the referees comments were very helpful in improving the presentation of the paper .",
    "i also want to thank sylwia zabocka for her support and friendship .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the category of small categories and let @xmath26 be the telescope category : @xmath27 for a functor @xmath28 the grothendieck construction on @xmath29  @xcite is the category @xmath30 whose objects are pairs @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "it follows that any functor @xmath45 defines a sequence of functors @xmath46 , @xmath47 moreover , for @xmath42 and @xmath33 let @xmath48 be the image under @xmath49 of the morphism @xmath50 .",
