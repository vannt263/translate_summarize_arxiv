    "the dispersion relation provides also important insight in the nature of the ground state .",
    "very common in low dimensional systems is the scenario of a singlet @xmath6 ground state _ without _ magnetic long range order ( a `` spin liquid '' ) of which the elementary excitations are triplets @xmath7 .",

    "this approach , however , becomes tedious for the description of realistic materials since the expansion parameter is often not really small .",

    "the same formalism as in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used .",

    "but on the basis of the neutron scattering results @xcite it is undoubtful that cugeo@xmath0 is a two - dimensional substance .",
    "furthermore , it must be considered that the previous fit @xcite was a two - parameter ( @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) fit whereas only one parameter ( @xmath46 ) is fitted to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : susz ] . the other parameters ( @xmath96 )",
    "were determined from an entirely different experiment .",

    "we will first discuss our results and propose a set of parameters .",
    "then we will put these results into the context of other results in the literature .",
    "let us consider the remaining difference between experiment and theory concerning @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : susz ] .",
    "there are four conceivable sources for it .",
    "the first are experimental inaccurcies .",
    "we are not in the position to judge this aspect . we just like to comment that from the results and error bars in fig .",
    "[ disp_small_c ] it is obvious that the experimental data is not completely consistent so that this explanation is possible .",
    "second , it is conceivable that the couplings change across the transition , i.e.  the intrachain frustration at @xmath97 ( where the dispersions are measured ) is different from the one above @xmath98 ( where @xmath87 is measured ) . since we are considering a spin - peierls transition",
    "there is definitely a structural change .",
    "so far , however , the assumption that only the dimerization changes worked well . the structural changes in the transition are very small @xcite whereas the changes needed to explain the discrepancy are of the order of 20 to 30 % ( assuming a change in the intrachain frustration ) .",
    "estimates point into the direction that the changes on the couplings are unimportant @xcite .",
    "yet the estimates concern in the first place the nearest - neighbor coupling only .",
    "quantitative ab initio calculations of the frustration are very difficult @xcite , even more so for changes of the frustration .",
    "so , again , this explanation is perhaps not the most promising but can not be excluded either .",
    "third , the influence of the phonon dynamics is to be considered .",
    "it is shown that spin - peierls systems can be unitarily transformed in such a way that an effective spin model remains at low energies uncoupled to the phonons @xcite .",
    "the effective couplings in a single chain model become temperature dependent so that this may account for the discrepancy .",
    "but it turns out for non - resonant phonons ( @xmath99 ) that these effects leave the susceptibility fairly unchanged .",
    "this is so since these effects become significant for relatively large temperatures where @xmath87 depends only on the sum of all couplings which is unchanged by the unitary transformation ( this is observed in ( vo)@xmath8p@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "so this reason appears rather unlikely even though it looked plausible at first sight .",
    "fourth , one has to think about any kind of precursors of the spin - peierls transition . by this we mean on one side the critical fluctuations which appear in a narrow region ( @xmath100 ) around the spin - peierls temperature @xcite . on the other side , we mean any precursor which goes beyond a purely static spin model .",
    "experimentally , a finite lattice correlation length can be detected already at @xmath101k far above the actual transition @xcite .",
    "from there on deviations from the behavior of a static spin model should be observable . in the adiabatic limit , for instance",
    ", the fluctuation yield already a reduction of the susceptibility @xcite .",
    "what happens in the antiadiabatic limit has not yet been investigated for a two or higher dimensional model .",
    "the mapping in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to four - point interchain couplings the influence of which is unclear so far .    in view of the above mentioned possible pitfalls of the static model",
    "the agreement in fig .",
    "[ fig : susz ] is already very convincing . summarizing our results we propose the parameters given for @xmath102 in tab .",
    "iii to be the ones deduced from the dispersion data . assessing the reliability of our estimates , we redo the analysis of the susceptibility for @xmath103 ( the upper bound of our estimate for @xmath3 ) with the corresponding value of @xmath104mev . then the optimum @xmath87 is obtained for @xmath105 ; the @xmath87 curve is almost identical to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : susz ] .",
    "so the value of @xmath46 can not be determined very precisely , but it should be in the range @xmath106 .",
    "a certain dicrepancy between the optimum parameters for the @xmath107 dispersion data and for the @xmath108 data remains .",
    "we split the comparison of our findings to previous works into three groups .",
    "the first comprises the analyses on the basis of a one - dimensional model @xcite . the most striking difference to the results for static spin models",
    "@xcite is that the dimerization @xmath83 is not of the order of 1% but significantly larger .",
    "this is not astounding since it has been noted already in [ i ] that the gap is lowered by the interchain hopping .",
    "hence the neglect of the latter requires to lower the gap otherwise , i.e.  by assuming a lower dimerization .",
    "our intrachain frustration is slightly larger than the one of castilla _",
    "et al_.  ( @xmath109 ) , but significantly smaller than the value of riera and dobry ( @xmath110 ) or the value of fabricius _",
    "et al_.  ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "et al_.showed that the value @xmath112 is too small for a single chain model .",
    "the difference between the larger frustration value in the single chain model to our value results directly from the interchain coupling . as can be nicely seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmf ] ) the interchain coupling lowers the susceptibility without changing ( in the chain mean - field approximation ) the position of its maximum .",
    "the one dimensional models favor a larger intrachain frustration and a concomitant larger coupling @xmath11 in order to reduce the magnitude of the susceptibility .    the claim by wellein and coworkers that the dimerization experimentally found to be larger than would fit to a static 1d model @xcite is due to the phonon dynamics is not compelling .",
    "they use a root - mean - square definition of the dimerization which naturally provides larger values for the dimerization since it includes all the fluctuations .",
    "the dispersion perpendicular to the chains , however , is an unambiguous experimental fact .",
    "furthermore , trebst and coworkers @xcite do not find a substantial gap renormalization for parameters relevant for cugeo@xmath0 even though one should take care of different schemes to couple the phonons .",
    "let us turn to the second group of papers considering the essentially two - dimensional character of cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "the first work used a bond - operator technique @xcite .",
    "no frustration was considered , hence rather small values of @xmath113mev and a rather small interchain hopping @xmath114 resulted .",
    "the same technique was also applied later again by brenig @xcite including frustration .",
    "it turned out , however , that only @xmath115 and @xmath116 matter on the free - boson level .",
    "hence an independent determination of the frustration is not possible .",
    "using additional input ( @xmath117 ) the values @xmath118 and @xmath119 were obtained . in view of the extensive comparisons to numerical results made in ref .",
    "@xcite it appears that the bond - operator method overestimates the influence of additional couplings such as dimerization or frustration . generally , the values for dimerization or frustration tend to be too low .",
    "this is confirmed by our findings in the present work .",
    "compared to [ i ] ( @xmath120mev , @xmath121 ) the extended series on which our present analysis is based gives a much better handle on intrachain frustration , see fig .",
    "[ trend_1 ] . only in the present work ,",
    "we are able to assess its value reliably . with respect to the interchain frustration ,",
    "the present results agree qualitatively with those in [ i ] where such a frustration was proposed for cugeo@xmath0 first .",
    "the use of susceptibility information has been improved in the present work since the whole @xmath87 curve is used , not only the leading coefficients .",
    "bouzerar _ et al .",
    "_ have carried out an estimate leading to results not too far from ours : @xmath122mev , @xmath123 .",
    "they used just linear order in the interchain hopping without interchain frustration and some square - root averaging with numerical results for chains to describe the dispersion . the intrachain frustration ( @xmath124 )",
    "could only be taken from the curie - weiss constant .",
    "the resulting @xmath87 has similarities with the experimental one .",
    "the third group comprises ab - initio calculations of the exchange couplings and of the spin - phonon couplings .",
