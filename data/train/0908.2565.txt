    "such the geometric curvature effect on quantum states has been discussed in the early - stage development of the quantum mechanics theory @xcite . still in the last years , the effect has focused renewed attention in the field of condensed matter physics , mainly due to technological progress that enables to fabricate low - dimensional nanostructures with complex geometry @xcite .",

    "it is worthy to note that the similar increasing behavior of @xmath6 was observed in sinusoidal hollow tubes @xcite , which implies that the presence of periodic curvature modulation rather than structural details is important for the increase in @xmath6 to occur .",
