    "this effective negative josephson coupling is similar to what can happen when tunnelling through magnetic impurities@xcite .",
    "the possibility of @xmath1 transitions may be utilized as a basis for future quantum qubits@xcite , constituting an important example in the field of superconducting spintronics@xcite .",

    "spin dependent quasiparticle reflection at the af surface , so - called q - reflection , combined with andreev reflection on the superconducting side , can lead to new low - energy bound states with important consequences for the associated proximity effect@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath3/af/@xmath3 josephson junctions these bound states can enhance the critical current @xmath7 at low @xmath4@xcite , and lead to @xmath8- or @xmath6-junction behavior depending on @xmath4 and thickness of the af interlayer@xcite . for @xmath3/af/@xmath3 junctions",
    "the @xmath1 behavior is a true even - odd effect arising from qualitatively different spectra of the andreev bound states caused by different symmetries of the odd and even af interfaces@xcite .",
    "we study the josephson current through in - plane @xmath0/af/@xmath0 tunnel junctions .",
    "such junctions have not been studied before theoretically .",
    "interestingly , our results are also relevant for d / f / d junctions . based on both analytical calculations and numerical solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations , we determine the criteria for @xmath1-junction behavior and predict unusual @xmath4 dependence of the critical current @xmath9 .",
    "intrinsic @xmath0/af/@xmath0 junctions may already be present in the case of high - t@xmath10 grain boundaries ( gb ) which induce af surface states .",
    "below , we also study the critical current through gb by modeling them as @xmath0/i/@xmath0 junctions , where i is an insulating layer but where the leads contain subdominant magnetic correlations which become important near order parameter - suppressing interfaces .",

    "this is not the case for @xmath0/af/@xmath0 junctions , where the 100 case displays only 0-junction characteristics with an ambegaokar - baratoff like dependence of @xmath9 .",

    "the josephson current is carried entirely by phase - dependent andreev bound states .",
    "for the 100 orientation the @xmath0-wave order parameter does not change its sign in specular reflection , but it changes sign in q - reflection processes .",
    "by contrast , in the 110 case the @xmath0-wave order parameter changes its sign both in specular and in q - reflection events .",
    "an important manifestation of this physical difference between effects of q - reflection for different af - interface orientations is that the @xmath1 transition does not take place for 100 orientation in @xmath0-wave junctions , but the transition is , in general , present in 110 @xmath0-wave , as well as 100 @xmath3-wave junctions .",
    "more formally , in the 110 case the specular and q - reflection possess identical outgoing group velocities and form the outgoing flow along one and the same direction .",
    "this permits the reduction of the problem to a standard situation with conventional number of incoming and outgoing waves , which determines the rank of the s - matrix .",
    "this is not the case for the 100 orientation , when specular and q reflection should be considered separately .",
    "this increases the rank of the s - matrix and makes ultimate results for 100 junctions with finite transparencies strongly different compared to the 110 case . in the following we focus solely on the 110 orientated interfaces .    for d / afodd / d junctions ,",
    "the general structure of the @xmath53 matrix is similar to that of d / f / d junctions with symmetric f interfaces .",
    "this follows from the fact that in the ( 110 ) orientation and for an odd number of chains in the interlayer , all spins are aligned in the outermost chains . for ( 110 ) d / afeven / d junctions , the outermost chains of the af interface have opposite spin polarizations ( but still all aligned within each chain ) and the @xmath53 matrix is isomorphic to the three - layer fif interface with antiparallel orientations of the two f layers@xcite . the existence of the even - odd ( @xmath1 ) behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) follows directly from this link between the @xmath54 matrices for 110 @xmath0/af/@xmath0 and d / f / d junctions@xcite .",
    "however , in order to understand the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath9 and obtain quantitative criteria for transitions between 0- or @xmath6-junction behavior , we turn now to the explicit calculations .    consider first ( 110 ) d / afeven / d junctions where the transparency coefficients satisfy @xmath55 , resulting in the following josephson current @xmath56 , \\label{josmagdfif}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the phase difference across the junction . here , not only @xmath59 and @xmath60 , but also the spin - mixing parameter @xmath61 ( @xmath62\\left\\{1+\\left [ m/4t\\cos\\left(k_y/\\sqrt{2}\\right)\\right]^2\\right\\}^{-1}$ ] ) , are all @xmath32-dependent , and the total current is a sum of eq . over all values of @xmath32@xcite .",

    "however , at low @xmath4 the current ( [ josmagdfif ] ) is given by @xmath64 which , in the tunnelling limit , reduces to @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , due to the factor @xmath66 , we find the remarkable result that the current substantially exceeds the critical current in nonmagnetic ( 110 ) @xmath0/i/@xmath0 junctions with the same transparency coefficient @xmath60 ( fig .",

    "is , in its turn , strongly modified due to finite @xmath61 at sufficiently low @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , it becomes exponentially small , if @xmath4 is much less than the spin - split finite energies of the andreev states @xmath78 . at the same time , the second term in eq .",
    "dominates the current at higher @xmath4 , for example , near @xmath2 . for this reason the @xmath1 transition arises in magnetic 110 d / afodd / d tunnel junctions under the condition @xmath82 , as a result of the interplay of the two terms with opposite signs in eq.([josmagtund ] ) . in principle , the change of sign of the total current in ( [ josmagtund ] ) takes place with varying @xmath4 for any small value of @xmath61 , but effects of finite transparency confine the conditions for the presence of a @xmath1 transition to not too small values of @xmath61 .    for deriving the conditions for the presence of the @xmath1 transition in the tunnelling limit , it is convenient to consider two limiting cases of eq.([josmagtund ] ) , one near @xmath2 and another at low @xmath4 .",

    "<S> we calculate the dc supercurrent through a josephson tunnel junction consisting of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) or ferromagnetic ( f ) interlayer sandwiched between two @xmath0-wave superconductors ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such junctions exhibit a rich dependence of the josephson current on the interlayer parameters , including the possibility of @xmath1 transitions with varying temperature or interlayer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study @xmath0/i/@xmath0 junctions when the dsc leads include subdominant magnetic correlations . induced magnetism near the interface can strongly diminish the critical current for 110 oriented junctions whereas no suppression exists for the 100 orientation . </S>",
    "<S> this may help resolve a long - standing puzzle of the critical current versus grain boundary angle in high-@xmath2 superconductors . </S>"
