    "in 2001 - 2003 , kovrizhin and his collaborators@xcite have shown an interesting theoretical prediction on the tunneling properties of bogoliubov excitations@xcite ; the bogoliubov excitations show perfect transmission across a potential barrier in the low - energy limit . it is called anomalous tunneling .",
    "it is quite different from an ordinary particle obeying schrdinger equation , which shows perfect reflection in the low - energy limit .",
    "later , danshita _ _ et al.__@xcite have extended the problem in the presence of the supercurrent . solving the delta - functional barrier problem , they have shown that ( a ) perfect transmission occurs even when the condensate supercurrent exists , except for the critical supercurrent state ; ( b ) under the critical supercurrent , the partial transmission occurs .",
    "thus , a consistent explanation for both perfect transmission in the non - critical states and the absence of perfect transmission in the critical state had been highly desired . as for the perfect transmission in the non - critical states ,",
    "its physical mechanism has been investigated in many works@xcite and importance of the similarity between the condensate and low - energy excitations has been pointed out .",
    "however , few results have been known on the critical supercurrent state .",
    "it is crucial to understand the reason why the critical supercurrent state shows an exceptional behavior , for the purpose of constructing a unified picture for non - critical and critical states . in our study , we prove the absence of perfect transmission in the critical supercurrent state for arbitrary shape of barrier , and clarify its physical mechanism .",

    "we have confirmed in the delta - functional barrier model that @xmath60 occurs only when there is no potential barrier .",
    "let us consider the physical origin of the absence of perfect transmission .",
    "the tunneling solution in the low - energy limit can be written as @xcite @xmath61 this is drastically different from the non - critical states , in which the wavefunctions of excitations coincide with the condensate wavefunction@xcite . in the non - critical states , there is only one non - divergent solution @xmath62 at @xmath29 , so @xmath63 can not contribute to the wavefunction of excitations in the low - energy limit . in the critical supercurrent state ,",
    "on the other hand , another non - divergent solution @xmath64 arises , and contributes to the low - energy wavefunction of excitations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curr : loc ] , this solution represents the density fluctuation localized near the potential barrier .",
    "thus , the presence of local density fluctuation near the barrier in the low - energy limit is the origin of the absence of perfect transmission .",
    "+ we further note that the critical supercurrent states are at the `` phase boundary '' which separates steady flow states and nonstationary flow states .",
    "( see , e.g. , fig .  1 in  ref .",
    "therefore , our result suggests that the emergence of low - energy density fluctuation can characterize the destabilization of the superflow . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown by numerical simulation of time - dependent gp equation that if @xmath65 , soliton - phonon creation occurs and stationary superflow no longer exists .",
    "we expect that the local density fluctuation @xmath66 possesses the information on the `` manner of collapse of stationary superflow '' .",
    "that is , the profile of the density fluctuation could describe a part of collapse phenomena , such as the soliton - phonon creation .",
    "thus , the investigation of the role of low - energy density fluctuation near the critical supercurrent state is left as a future work .",
    "in conclusion , with use of the exact solution of bogoliubov equations at zero - energy , we have exactly proved the absence of perfect transmission of bogoliubov excitations in the critical supercurrent state for arbitrary shape of potential barrier .",
    "the origin of the absence of perfect transmission is the emergence of low - energy density fluctuation near the potential barrier . because of this density fluctuation , wavefunctions of excitations does not coincide with the condensate wavefunction in the low - energy limit .",
