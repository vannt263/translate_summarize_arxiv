    "as we know , a charged particle walking through a region where only magnetic flux exists acquires a phase .",
    "we call this aharonov - bohm effect ( abe ) .",
    "since aharonov and bohm [ 1 ] proposed an experiment to assess the manifestations of the electromagnetic potential in the quantum mechanics in 1959 , some work [ 2 - 4 ] has been investigated by researchers , and they concluded that all observable phenomena are modulated by the magnetic flux through region , and that these phenomena with respect to @xmath0 demonstrate period with magnetic flux quantum @xmath1 . with the advance of lithography and semiconductor growth techniques , the nanoring - like devices [ 5 - 8 ] have been realized experimentally . due to unique character of the nanoring",
    ", the self - assembled quantum ring has become the best ideal candidate to observe aharonov - bohm ( a - b ) oscillation [ 9 - 11 ] .    in 1995 , chaplik [ 12 ] first put forward predication that the neutral exciton can exhibit a - b oscillator behavior in one - dimensional quantum ring . and",
    "subsequently similar results were found in the literature [ 13 ] where a short - range interaction potential has been employed . over the last decade ,",
    "some researchers had paid their attention to a - b effect of neutral exciton in two - dimensional quantum ring .",
    "for instance , hu @xmath2 @xmath3 [ 9 ] theoretically studied the magnetic field effects on exciton in an @xmath4 nanoring , they found that the a - b effect of exciton only exists in a finite ( but small ) width nanoring in the presence of coulomb correlation .",
    "ribeiro @xmath2 @xmath3 [ 14 ] experimentally presented a magneto - photoluminescence study of type - ii @xmath5 self - assembled quantum dot , which revealed that a - b type oscillations for neutral excitons when angular momentum of hole ground state ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "dias da silva @xmath2 @xmath3 [ 15 ] reported impurity effects on the a - b optical signatures of neutral quantum ring magnetoexcitons .",
    "their results , on the one hand , show that energy and oscillator strength of neutral excitons are strongly modulated by the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "scattering impurity enhances the photoluminescence ( pl ) intensity on otherwise `` dark '' magnetic field windows and nonzero pl emission appears for a wide magnetic field range even at zero temperature . recently ding @xmath2 @xmath3 [ 10 ]",
    "has investigated the magneto - pl study of a single self - assembled semiconductor quantum ring which is realized by @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 etching [ 16 ] and experimentally observed the a - b type oscillations in the photoluminescence energy . as mentioned above ,",
    "studies about a - b effect are mainly focused on energy and oscillator strength of an exciton in a nanoring .",
    "the research into a - b effect on nonlinear optical properties has been rarely reported so far .",
    "understanding nonlinear optical properties of an exciton in a nanoring is of significance for designing optical devices .",
    "hence , it is of interest to study the nonlinear optical properties of an exciton in a nanoring . in the present work",
    ", we will focus on studying nonlinear optical absorption and nonlinear optical rectification of an exciton in a nanoring .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the model and theoretical framework , section 3 is dedicated to the results and discussions , and finally , our conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "here we are concerned with a nanoring with winternitz - smorodinsky confinement potential . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "applied along z - direction , hamiltonian of single article reads    @xmath13 ^{2}+v(\\textbf{r}),\\ ] ]    in eq.(1 ) , @xmath14 is effective mass , @xmath15 is the electron charge , @xmath16 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath17 is magnetic vector potential .",
    "@xmath18 is given by reference [ 17 ] @xmath19    it should be noted that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the confinement potential parameters which are connected with the outer radius @xmath22 and inner radius @xmath23 by the following relations [ 17 ] @xmath24 @xmath25 where for electron @xmath26 and for hole @xmath27 . when the magnetic vector potential @xmath17 is chosen as @xmath28 and applying the polar coordinates ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath29\\nonumber \\\\ + i\\frac{eb\\hbar}{2\\mu c}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varphi}+i\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}})-\\frac{e^{2}b^{2}r^{2}}{8\\mu c^{2}}+v(\\textbf{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is magnetic flux quantum . according to schr@xmath31dinger equation @xmath32",
    "we can obtain wave function and energy spectrum of single as follows : @xmath33}{2^{m+1}n_{r}!(\\gamma[m+1])^{2}\\pi}}(\\frac{r}{\\lambda})^{m}e^{-\\frac{r^{2}}{4\\lambda^{2}}}f(-n_{r},m + 1;\\frac{r^{2}}{2\\lambda^{2}})e^{im\\varphi},\\ ] ] @xmath34 where @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath36 is the confluent hypergeometric function . @xmath37",
    "is the radial quantum number , @xmath38 is the magnetic quantum number .    with @xmath39 and @xmath40 denoting the effective cyclotron frequency and effective magnetic length , respectively .",
    "for an exciton in a nanoring , the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath41    here we assume that electron and hole are confined by the same potential . and the last term in right - hand of eq .",
    "( 12 ) is assumed to be perturbation . according to perturbation method ,",
    "we can obtain the correction from coulomb interaction to energy[17 ] .",
    "the oscillator strength [ 18 ] is a very important physical quantity in the study of the optical properties which are related to the electronic dipole - allowed transitions . generally , the oscillator strength @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the energy difference between the initial state and the final state , and @xmath45 is the electric dipole moment of the transition from the @xmath46 state to the @xmath47 state .",
    "based on the density matrix approach and the perturbation expansion method , the second - order nonlinear optical rectification coefficient is given by [ 19,20 ] @xmath48(\\frac{t_{1}}{t_{2}}-1))}{\\varepsilon_{0}[(e_{fi}-\\hbar\\omega)^{2}+(\\frac{\\hbar}{t_{2}})^{2}][(e_{fi}+\\hbar\\omega)^{2}+(\\frac{\\hbar}{t_{2}})^{2}]}.\\ ] ]    in the present work , we also performed calculation of the intensity - dependent resonant peaks of the nonlinear optical absorption and nonlinear optical rectification coefficient which are given by reference [ 21 ] @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath52 is the refractive index of semiconductor .",
    "@xmath53 denotes the electron density in the nanoring . in addition , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation times , respectively . in the calculation",
    ", we set the relaxation time at @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "our calculations are performed for @xmath58 nanoring .",
    "the parameters [ 17,22 ] chosen in this work are the followings : @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the free electron mass .",
    "@xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .    in fig",
    "1 , we plotted transition energy as a function of inner radius @xmath23 , outer radius @xmath22 , respectively , for two different magnetic field @xmath65 , @xmath66 . from this figure",
    ", we can find that transition energy has a continuous increase with respect to inner radius for a fixed outer radius , while that transition energy is reduced for the fixed inner radius as outer radius increases .",
    "here we define width of a nanoring by the difference in size between outer radius and inner radius @xmath67 .",
    "it should be noted that transition energy is not almost affected by the variations of inner or outer radius when @xmath68 is greater than @xmath69 .",
    "also it can be easily seen that transition energy suddenly becomes very large when @xmath68 is very narrow ( around @xmath70 ) .",
    "the physical origins , for these behaviors , can be interpreted in the following way . for wider ring ,",
    "exciton moving in the ring can be considered to be two - dimensional , while for narrower ring , one can take exciton as one - dimensional .",
    "two - dimensional nanoring evolves into one - dimensional when width of the nanoring continuously decreases .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "1 , the magnetic field has no influence on the transition energy of an exciton .",
    "2 shows oscillator strength as a function of outer radius @xmath22 , inner radius @xmath23 , respectively , for two different magnetic field @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we find from this figure that oscillator strength with respect to inner or outer radius has similar behaviors as shown in fig .",
    "the reasons are that there is a greater probability of transition between the initial and the final state when exciton moves in a narrower ring . in fig .",
    "3 , oscillator strength as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is easily seen from this figure that oscillator strength decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "but the aharonov - bohm oscillations of exciton is not observed in the nanoring .",
    "we can provide this phenomenon with the reason .",
    "electron and hole are confined to the same potential in the nanoring and move over same path , leading to zero in electric dipole moment [ 23 ] . magnetic flux through nanoring",
    "has an effect on wave function of electron and hole .",
    "hence , the probability of transition between different states in a nanoring is dependent on magnetic flux .    in fig .",
    "4 , nonlinear optical absorption was presented as a function of inner radius @xmath23 , outer radius @xmath22 , respectively , for magnetic field @xmath65 .",
    "we see that nonlinear optical absorption is not sensitive to the variations of inner or outer radius for the wider ring , while that nonlinear optical absorption instantly become very huge when @xmath68 is reduced to be quite narrow and can be taken as one - dimensional . and fig .",
    "5 demonstrates that nonlinear optical absorption with respect to magnetic flux @xmath0 with three different widths of a ring .",
    "it is clearly seen that effect of magnetic flux on the nonlinear absorption can be tuned by the width of a ring .",
    "so we can tune the outer and inner radius to meet special needs in experiment , which is very significant in designing devices .    in fig . 6 ,",
    "nonlinear optical rectification was plotted as a function of photon energy with magnetic field for three different @xmath68 .",
    "we note from this figure that the magnitude of resonant peak of nonlinear rectification increases as @xmath68 increases . also , the position of resonant peak of nonlinear optical rectification has a blue shift , which is modulated by width of a ring .",
    "in addition , we also observe that the magnitudes of resonant peak are far less than results from literature [ 21 ] where parabolic confinement potential is employed to confine electron and hole . and",
    "this indicates that the winternitz - smorodinsky potential is not realistic in crystal .",
    "7 shows nonlinear optical rectification as a function of inner radius @xmath23 , outer radius @xmath22 , respectively , for magnetic field @xmath65 .",
    "when outer radius is set at @xmath73 , nonlinear optical rectification is negative and decreases with inner radius ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "and then the nonlinear rectification monotonously increases with increasing inner radius .",
    "in addition , we also see that the nonlinear optical rectification monotonously decreases with outer radius for a fixed @xmath23 . finally , we shows nonlinear optical rectification as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 in fig .",
    "8 . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the nonlinear rectification increases with respect to @xmath0 . and",
    "no a - b oscillation is observed in this figure .",
    "we have investigated the effects of magnetic flux , size of quantum ring on transition energy , oscillator strength , nonlinear optical absorption and nonlinear optical rectification of exciton in a nanoring with winternitz - smorodinsky confinement potential .",
    "our results show that transition energy , oscillator strength , nonlinear optical absorption and nonlinear optical rectification are strongly affected by width of a nanoring , and that one can control these properties of a nanoring by modulating the outer or inner radius to meet special needs in designing electro - optical devices .",
    "in addition , it is found that the magnetic flux can tune transition energy , oscillator strength , nonlinear optical absorption and nonlinear optical rectification of a nanoring .    in conclusion ,",
    "the properties of an exciton in nanoring are strongly dependent on width of a ring and magnetic flux .",
    "finally we hope our research can stimulate further studies in nonlinear optical properties of a nanoring .",
