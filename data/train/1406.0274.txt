    "the phase - reduction theory provides a general framework to simplify multidimensional ordinary differential equations ( odes ) describing weakly perturbed limit - cycle oscillators to one - dimensional approximate phase equations  @xcite .",

    "various types of low - dimensional phase equations have been derived for rd systems , in particular for traveling pulses  @xcite and for rotating spirals  @xcite . in most cases , however , it is assumed that the system is symmetric with respect to continuous spatial translation or rotation and the spatial structure is rigidly translating or rotating , so that their location or angle is simply identified as the phase .",
    "however , such assumptions exclude various intriguing rhythmic dynamics of rd systems that lack continuous spatial symmetry . since limit cycles are essentially associated with _",
    "temporal _ translational symmetry , we should be able to derive phase equations from general rd systems without recourse to spatial symmetry .",
    "our goal in the present study is to develop , without assuming any spatial symmetry or rigidity , a phase - reduction theory for weakly perturbed rd systems exhibiting stable rhythmic dynamics .",
    "we solve this problem by generalizing the conventional phase - reduction theory for odes to rd systems .",
