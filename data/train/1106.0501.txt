    "galactic outflows are believed to be an important ingredient in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is thought to provide a feedback mechanism for the regulation of star formation in galaxies , and the subsequent chemical evolution in them .",
    "also , galactic scale winds are thought to enrich the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with metals .",
    "observations also show that galactic scale outflows are common in starburst galaxies in both local and high redshift universe ( veilleux et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in the standard scenario , the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the starburst galaxy",
    "is heated by supernovae ( sn ) , the thermal pressure of the hot gas drives the outflowing gas .",
    "larson ( 1974 ) , saito ( 1979 ) , dekel & silk ( 1986 ) argued that supernovae in a star forming galaxy would drive an outflow in excess of the escape speed from the galaxy .",
    "this scenario , however , has met with problems from new observations .",
    "recent observations of cold clouds embedded in the hot gas show that the maximum speed of these clouds is correlated with the star formation rate ( martin 2005 ) , a correlation that is more easily explained by outflows driven by radiation pressure than thermal pressure .",
    "observations of lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) at @xmath4 have also found a correlation between the outflow speed and the star formation rate , as well as with the reddening due to dust . also , sn explosions in disk galaxies may only produce a thickening of the disk gas because of the incoherent nature of these explosions ( fragile , murray , lin 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , cold clouds embedded in the hot gas in the outflow are not likely to survive longer than a myr , because of various instabilities and/or evaporation by thermal conduction .",
    "murray ( 2005 ; hereafter referred to as mqt05 ) showed that radiation pressure can be comparable to the ram pressure in hot outflows , and considered radiatively driven shells of gas and dust .",
    "martin ( 2005 ) found that this scenario provides a better framework in order to understand the observed correlations .",
    "nath & silk ( 2008 ) discussed a hybrid model of outflows with radiation and thermal pressure . in this paper , we study dust driven gaseous winds from luminous disk galaxies .",
    "we estimate the terminal speed of the combined gas and dust flow , taking into account the gravity of the dark matter halo , and the disk mass - to - light ratio that is expected from stellar population synthesis models .",
    "recently zhang & thompson ( 2010 ) considered a disk of radius @xmath5 constant surface density ( @xmath6 ) and surface brightness ( @xmath7 ) . assuming a cylindrical geometry , the force of gravitation @xmath8 , and that due to radiation @xmath9 , along the pole are given by , f_g=2 g , f_r= , [ eq : fg ] where @xmath10 is the average opacity of dust grains to absorption and scattering of photons .",
    "the ratio of these forces , the eddington ratio , increases with the height @xmath11 , beginning with a value of @xmath12 at the disk centre at @xmath13 . from energy conservation they found the velocity at height @xmath11 , to be ,    v_z^2=4 g d(_0 ^-1()-1-+ ) .",
    "this implies a terminal velocity of @xmath14 , with a lower limit on @xmath15 for driving an outflow .    assuming a keplerian disk , with average rotation speed of @xmath16 , the terminal velocity can be written as @xmath17 , which yields a value @xmath18 , for @xmath19 .",
    "but these results will change with the proper inclusion of bulge and dark matter halo .",
    "in this paper , we discuss steady , rotating wind in which dust is propelled outwards by radiation pressure and drags the gas with it .",
    "we ignore magnetic forces and treat the wind as a single - phase fluid , which is marginally optically thick ( mqt05 ) .",
    "although our results are valid for all temperatures , in practice the model allows for only cold flows ( as observed in nai and mgii lines ( e.g. martin 2005 ) ) for the following reasons .",
    "the sputtering radius for grains over a wind timescale of 10 myr ( which we derive below ) is @xmath20 @xmath21 for @xmath22 k ( tielens 1994 ) , which implies that only grains smaller than @xmath23 @xmath21 are destroyed , without changing the opacity .",
    "but the radiative cooling time is small ( @xmath24 myr ) , so for adiabatic approximation to be valid , the adiabatic - cooling time scale should be shorter than the radiative - cooling timescale , which limits the temperature @xmath25 k. also the timescale for dust - heating is @xmath26 myr and can be neglected .    secondly , we improve upon the previous estimates of the required value of @xmath27 needed to drive a wind , by taking into account the gravity of bulge and halo . clearly the relation between @xmath0 of the wind and @xmath28 in which the rotation speed is estimated from a keplerian disk is not relevant for disk galaxies , because the rotation speed must be calculated from the dark matter halo .",
    "we consider a disk with constant surface density ( @xmath6 ) and surface brightness ( @xmath7 ) , of radius @xmath5 , and which is embedded in a bulge and a halo .",
    "we assume a spherical mass distribution in the bulge and the halo .",
    "for the bulge , we assume a total mass of @xmath29 inside a radius @xmath30 .    for the halo , we consider a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile , with total mass @xmath31 characterized by a concentration parameter @xmath32 ( navarro , frenk , white 1997 ) .",
    "we fix the total halo mass for a given disk mass ( @xmath33 ) , by the ratio @xmath34 , as determined by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) ( referred to as mmw98 hereafter ) .",
    "we use the prescription of mmw98 for the disk exponential scale - length @xmath35 , using their eqns 23 , 26 , 32 , and use @xmath36 , since the total masses in the case of uniform density and exponential disk are given by @xmath37 . the rotation speed implied by the nfw profile peaks at a radius @xmath38 , given by , v_c ^2=v_200 ^ 2 c 2 ( 3)-2/3 ( 1+c ) -c/(1+c ) , where @xmath39 is the scale radius of nfw profile and @xmath40 is the rotation speed at the virial radius .",
    "we choose this value of the maximum rotation speed to represent the @xmath1 of the disk galaxy , since figure 2 of mmw98 shows that the value of @xmath1 from the flat part of the total rotation curve does not differ much from the peak of the rotation curve from halo only .",
    "we also use @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , consistent with observed range of luminosity ratio between bulge and disk ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) .      to determine the terminal speed of the wind",
    ", we use the fact that the bernoulli function is preserved along a streamline , assuming that a streamline extends from the base to infinity . in an isothermal wind",
    "the terminal speed tends to infinity as the wind maintains constant sound speed .",
    "it is however more reasonable to assume a polytropic equation of state .",
    "one can write the bernoulli equation for a polytropic gas ( with adiabatic index @xmath43 ) along a streamline : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the sound speed , @xmath46 is the potential and @xmath47 is a constant . equating the values at the base and infinity , we have + c_s , ^2 - 1+_= + c_s , b ^2 - 1 + _ b , [ eq : bern ] where @xmath48 is the wind speed at the base ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath49 is the sound speed at the base , and @xmath50is the sound speed at infinity , which is negligible .",
    "the potential is ,    @xmath51    here the first term denotes a pseudo - potential due to radiation pressure .",
    "the second term refers to the gravitational potential of the disk , and here we have assumed for analytical simplicity that gas stays near the pole , so these forces are given by eqn@xmath52 .",
    "the third term is the potential due to the outward centrifugal force of the rotating gas in the wind , and the last two terms denote the effect of the bulge and halo gravity .",
    "we also assume that the bulge exerts a negligible radiation pressure , since the dominant bulge stellar population is old and red and the mean opacity @xmath10 of dust grains in these wavelengths is smaller than in blue band .",
    "the centrifugal force at the base of the rotating wind should be equal to gravitational force due to the mass inside @xmath53 , the radial distance at the base .",

    "the second term can be approximated as @xmath57 which is much smaller than the bulge term @xmath58 , because the gravity of baryons dominates at small radii . neglecting the halo term , the specific angular momentum is given by , @xmath59 finally , the values of the potential at the base and infinity are as follows ,    @xmath60 \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_\\infty=&&-2 \\pi g \\sigma d \\bigl ( { \\gamma_0 \\pi \\over 2 } \\bigr ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that the radiation pseudo - potential is zero at the base but @xmath61 at infinity along the pole . since the dark matter halo is truncated at @xmath62 , its potential vanishes at infinity .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the wind speed at the base is comparable to the sound speed in the disk ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "figure 1 shows the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath68 , and on the concentration parameter @xmath66 for @xmath69 , and for @xmath70 .",
    "the sound speed makes only a small difference to the terminal speed , but it helps establishing a quasi - steady regime in the outflow redistributing the pressure over the entire flow .",

    "the important finding here is that the wind requires @xmath72 .",
    "we next use a relation between @xmath66 and galactic mass given by macci ( 2007 ) , and calculate the wind speed for galaxies with different masses , or rotation speeds .",

    "for @xmath84 , this is given by @xmath85 .",
    "this upper limit on disk @xmath86 is much lower than observed in present day disk galaxies .",
    "the milky way disk has a local value of @xmath87 ( flynn 2006 ) , and the typical value for disk galaxies is @xmath88 ( fukugita , hogan , peebles 1998 ) . according to flynn ( 2006 ) ,",
    "a third of the total disk mass comes from gas and the rest from stars .",
    "starburst galaxies can have a much lower value of @xmath86 .",
    "the estimated @xmath89 for ngc 7714 is @xmath90 ( bernlhr 1993a ) , for regions in ngc 520 it is @xmath91 ( bernlhr 1993 ) , and for a young super cluster in m82 , smith & gallagher ( 2001 ) has estimated the @xmath92 .",
    "these low values of @xmath93 are believed to arise from a top heavy imf and young age of the stellar population ( e.g. , kotilainen 2001 ; smith & gallagher 2001 ) .",
    "for an instantaneous burst these models predict an initial period of roughly constant luminosity for @xmath94 myr , and a decrease in the luminosity afterwards ( bruzual & charlot 2005 ; buzzoni 2005 ; vsquez & leitherer 2005 ) . for a salpeter imf and a stellar mass - luminosity relation of the type @xmath95 ,",
    "the late - time decay of the luminosity is given by @xmath96 , for @xmath97 ) .",
    "the initial period of rather constant luminosity stems from the fact that while low - mass stars are yet to collapse , the massive stars evolve quickly , and the duration of this period corresponds to the main - sequence life - time of the most massive stars .    using these models",
    "we can determine the @xmath93 for a stellar population , multiplying by a factor @xmath98 to account for an additional gas mass , and determine the expected disk @xmath86 ratio as a function of time after an instantaneous starburst . using the results in figure 9 of vsquez & leitherer ( 2005 ) , which uses a salpeter imf between @xmath99 and @xmath100 m@xmath101 , and using @xmath102",
    ", one can calculate @xmath86 as a function of time .",
    "strength of instantaneous starburst is characterized by total mass converted into stars initially , which in this case is @xmath103 m@xmath101 .    using the mean dust opacity for b band , we calculated the time evolution of @xmath27 , and then determined the wind terminal speed using eqn@xmath104 . although the use of eqn@xmath104 assumes a constant @xmath27 along a streamline , the distance travelled by the wind over the time - scale of change of @xmath27 ( @xmath105 ) is large ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "in other words , the time - scale for the wind to reach a considerable height above the disk is comparable to the time - scale of evolution in @xmath27 , and therefore we can use our formalism to estimate the terminal speed with the evolution in @xmath27 .",

    "it is interesting that this result coincides with observations , since there is no free parameter in our calculation .",
    "the strength of our approach lies in the fact that the terminal speed calculated using the bernoulli function is independent of the streamline used by the gas , _ as long as _",
    "streamlines do extend to infinity , which is our basic assumption .",
    "below we discuss a few implications .    in the scenario of energy driven winds ,",
    "the igm is believed to be enriched by winds from dwarf galaxies , since they were numerous in the early universe ( silk , wyse & shields 1987 ; nath & trentham 1997 ; ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ; cen & bryan 2001 ; madau , ferrara , rees 2001 ; aguirre 2001 ) . however , in the case of dust - driven winds , the importance of low - mass galaxies in igm enrichment diminishes because @xmath113 .",
    "our calculations here show that the wind speed depends strongly on the time elapsed after a starburst , or more generally on the star formation history and parameters .",
    "it is believed that the imf is weighted towards massive stars at high redshift ( e.g. , schneider & omukai 2010 ) , in which case the wind speed likely increases with redshift . in this case",
    "the contribution of dwarf galaxies at high redshift may still be important .",
    "recent simulations for igm enrichment including momentum driven winds have used the ansatz @xmath114 ( oppenheimer & dav 2006 ) , using the estimates of mqt05 for wind from a spherical galaxy radiating close to the dust eddington luminosity .",
    "it has been suggested that the momentum driven winds drive a feedback loop that makes @xmath114 ( martin 2005 ; mqt05 ) .",
    "our calculations show that such dust - driven winds are possible only within a period of @xmath3 myr after a starburst .",
    "since the wind speed depends strongly on the value of disk @xmath93 , which depends on the imf ( being smaller for a top - heavy imf ) , the wind speed is expected to be larger for a imf skewed towards massive stars .",
    "the implications needs to be studied with numerical simulations using modified prescriptions for the wind speed .",
    "it is possible that this puts constraints on the metallicity of the wind gas .",
    "in addition , as the dust opacity is proportional to the metallicity , @xmath115 , the existence of a threshold @xmath27 needed for the wind to reach infinity suggests that only metal - rich galaxies can enrich igm .",
    "we note that our calculation does not determine streamlines , without which we can not calculate the density structure in the wind , and therefore can not derive the mass loss rate . in the case of single scattering ,",
    "the maximum mass loss rate is @xmath116 ( mqt05 ) .",
    "this recovers the scaling that @xmath117 adopted by numerical simulations ( oppenheimer & dav 2006 ) . taking our results into account",
    ", the mass loss rate for a given luminosity is expected to be lower at high redshift , because of the possible rise of @xmath0 with @xmath11 arising from imf evolution .    in summary",
    ", we have derived a terminal speed for dust - driven outflows from disk galaxies , and have shown that @xmath118 , which is determined by the minimum value of disk @xmath119 arising from the luminosity of a stellar population , and the relation between the disk and dark matter halo that fixes the terminal speed for a given value of @xmath93 .",
