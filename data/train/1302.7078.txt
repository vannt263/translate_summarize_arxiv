    "currently , the cosmological observational data provides strong support for the simplest single field slow - roll inflationary models predicting nearly scale - invariant , adiabatic and gaussian density perturbations .",
    "however , there still exist many inflationary models compatible with the current data .",
    "these models may have interesting deviations from the prediction of the simplest inflationary models .",
    "in particular , the axion and the wimpzilla scenarios @xcite in inflationary models can give rise to cdm isocurvature perturbation and non - gaussianities , which are detectable by ongoing and near future experiments .",
    "in the literature , the cosmological implication of these scenarios has been studied with the assumption that the cross - correlation between curvature perturbation and isocurvature perturbation is negligible .",
    "the careful prediction of the cross - correlation is very important because the current observational constraints of the cdm isocurvature significantly depend on the cross - correlation .",
    "however , the validity of the assumption is not evident because of the gravitational interaction of perturbations .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the curvature and isocurvature cross - correlation @xmath0 for the axion and the wimpzilla scenarios .",
    "particularly , we emphasize the importance of diffeomorphism invariance in the computation of the cross - correlation .",
    "we present the result of the computation , which shows that the cross - correlation is too small to be detectable through the current cmb experiments , and this provides proof of the validity of the assumption .",
    "the current observational data shows that the cmb power spectrum is consistent with the adiabatic initial condition .",
    "however , it does not completely rule out contributions from cdm isocurvature , but it provides the constraints on the primordial isocurvature perturbations , which is usually parameterized by two variables @xmath1 where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the power spectra of adiabatic , isocurvature perturbations , and their cross - correlation , respectively , at the primordial epoch .",
    "the isocurvature contribution to the cmb temperature perturbation is expected to be roughly less than 10% compared to the curvature contribution .",
    "more precisely , based on the wmap+bao+@xmath4 data @xcite , @xmath5 where the subscript denotes the parameter @xmath6 , which is the fractional cross - correlation .",
    "the significant difference in the upper - bound of @xmath7 between uncorrelated and totally ( anti-)correlated cases originates from the different behaviors of the adiabatic and isocurvature radiation transfer functions .",
    "in particular , the transfer function of isocurvature perturbations on small scales is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath8 compared to that of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "therefore , when the cross - correlation is not negligible @xmath9 , the cross - correlation contribution @xmath3 to the cmb temperature perturbation is generally larger than the pure isocurvature contribution @xmath10 on small scales .",
    "this explains why the upper limit of @xmath7 for totally ( anti-)correlated models is tighter than that for uncorrelated models .",
    "therefore , estimating the cross - correlation is crucial to give correct predictions and restrict the parameters of isocurvature models .",
    "for instance , the axion scenario with a negligible homogeneous vacuum misalignment angle ( and similarly the wimpzilla scenario with a negligible homogenous background field value ) predicts detectable non - gaussianity @xcite @xmath11 if the assumption that the cross - correlation is zero or negligible is valid . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the cross - correlation for the axion and the wimpzilla scenarios .",
    "we consider the axion and the wimpzilla scenarios discussed in refs .",
    "particularly , we assume that pecci - quinn symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation for axions . in both scenarios ,",
    "when the spatial average value of the axion or the wimpzilla is much less than its inhomogeneity , the isocurvature perturbation generated from their density perturbations in the comoving gauge is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes an axion or wimpzilla field , and @xmath14 . for axions ,",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pq symmetry breaking scale and @xmath17 is the inhomogeneity of the phase of axion .    in order to obtain the cross - correlation @xmath0",
    ", we calculate the correlator @xmath18 using `` in - in '' formalism @xcite .",
    "we only consider the gravitational coupling whose interaction hamiltonian is derived from the adm formalism with a gauge choice . with the comoving gauge@xmath19 ,",
    "the cubic interaction hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the stress energy tensor of the field @xmath13 , and @xmath22 is the scalar metric perturbation .",
    "then the two - point correlator is written as @xmath23\\right\\rangle + \\mathcal{o}\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right),\\label{eq : sigma2zeta}\\ ] ] where the contributions from other interaction terms are @xmath24 because they are derivatively coupled with @xmath25 .",
    "one might try to estimate the integral using the super - horizon approximation frequently used to compute correlators in the inflationary de sitter background , which yields a large cross - correlation .",
    "however , the estimation fails because of the explicit breaking of diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "in fact , the integral ( [ eq : sigma2zeta ] ) turns out to be small because of the ward identity associated with diffeomorphism invariance , especially the spatial dilatation , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 notice that the curvature perturbation @xmath25 is smoothly extended to the spatial dilatation transform by taking the external momentum @xmath28 to zero @xcite .",
    "this fact with the ward identity allows us to factorize @xmath29 from a correlator involving external @xmath25 in the @xmath30 limit .",
    "the well - known example is the consistency relation for the 3-point function of @xmath25 in the squeezed limit @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , in the two - point function case , we find @xmath33 note that here we assume that uv divergences are properly treated .",
    "@xcite for details .    in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "this computation has been done explicitly , and we have found that @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the hubble scale at which scale p exits the horizon , @xmath36 and @xmath37.@xmath38 in addition , in the ds space - time , we have @xmath39,\\label{eq : sigma2sigma2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 . combining the results ( [ eq : sigma2zeta_ds_cg ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma2sigma2 ] ) yields the fractional cross - correlation @xmath41 which is quite small ; however , this result is still interesting because the cross - correlation is not decaying , and because it is independent of the parameters , such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the above result shows that the fractional cross - correlation @xmath44 in both scenarios , which is too small to be measured through the current cmb experiment .",
    "more precisely , in order to have approximately the same level of the cmb power spectrums from pure isocurvature and cross - correlation at the intermediate scale @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 , the fractional cross - correlation should be at least @xmath47 .",
    "the smallness of the cross - correlation is understood by the fact that the super - horizon mode of the curvature perturbation @xmath25 can be smoothly extended to the gauge mode , which is the spatial dilatation in the @xmath30 limit .",
    "physically , the curvature perturbation @xmath25 can affect the particle density @xmath48 and generate small cross - correlation only at its horizon crossing , since @xmath25 freezes after horizon exit and effectively becomes a gauge mode .",
    "thus this verifies the assumption that the cross - correlation is negligible in the axion and the wimpzilla scenarios .",
