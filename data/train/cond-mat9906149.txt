    "in recent years considerable study has been given to the theory of self ",
    "organized criticality ( soc ) [ 1 ] that explains spontaneous ( avalanche - type ) dynamics , unlike the typical phase transitions that occur only when a controlling parameter is tuned to a critical value .",
    "a main feature of the systems displaying soc is that they are distributed over avalanche sizes , so that soc models are mostly studied by making use of scaling - type arguments supplemented with extensive computer simulations ( see [ 2 ] ) . on the contrary , in this paper we put forward the theory of a single avalanche formation .",
    "the soc behavior appears in a variety of systems such as a real sand pile ( ensemble of grains of sand moving along increasingly tilted surface ) , intermittency in biological evolution [ 3 ] , earthquakes and propagation of forest  fires , depinning transitions in random medium and so on [ 4 ] . among the above models the simplest and most widely studied , analytically [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] and numerically [ 1 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , are the sandpile models . the field theory [ 9 ] , based on nonlinear diffusion equation , has failed to account for the basic feature of self  organized systems  their avalanche dynamics .",
    "the reason is that there is no feedback between open subsystem and thermostat within the framework of the one  parameter approach employed in [ 9 ] .",
    "recently the two ",
    "parameter theories were set forth in [ 10,11 ] , where the thermostat degree of freedom was either controlling parameter [ 10 ] , or conjugate field [ 11 ] . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the approach of [ 11 ] allows to obtain critical exponents governing scaling behavior of self  organized system .",
    "our approach is to take into consideration the complete set of degrees of freedom . owing to this , not only the complimentary results of [ 10,11 ]",
    "are reproduced , but it is possible to obtain the self  consistent analytical description of the single avalanche formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the self - consistent theory of the formation of a flux steady - state is presented . it enables us to treat the problem on the basis of the unified analytical approach .",
    "3 deals with accounting additive noises of the sand velocity components and sandpile slope .",
    "it is shown that the noise intensities increase the possibility of emergence of the soc regime .",
    "sec.4 contains the obtained results .",
    "within framework of the simplest model of a sandpile , a dependence @xmath0 defines its surface at given instant of time @xmath1 .",
    "locally the flow of sand can be described in terms of three quantities : the horizontal and vertical components of the sand velocity , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the surface slope @xmath4 .",
    "the key point of our approach is that the above degrees of freedom are assumed to be of dissipative type , so that , when they are not coupled , their relaxation to the steady state is governed by the debye - type equations :    [ 1 ] @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the relaxation times of the velocity components and the slope , respectively .",
    "( [ 1a ] )  ( [ 1c ] ) imply the sand is at rest in the stationary state , @xmath10 and the equilibrium slope @xmath11 plays the role of a controlling parameter .    since the motion of sand grain along different directions is not independent , eq.([1a ] )",
    "should be changed by adding the term @xmath12 due to liquid friction force along the @xmath13axis ( @xmath14 is the kinetic coefficient ) .",
    "then , we have    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .",
    "note that , owing to the diffusion equation @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient ) , the friction force appears to be driven by the curvature of the sandpile surface :    @xmath19    on the other hand , when @xmath20 ( stationary state ) , solution of eq.([2 ] ) defines the tangent line @xmath21 , so that the friction force @xmath22 is proportional to the horizontal component of the sand velocity .",
    "taking into consideration the relation ( [ 3 ] ) and using the chain rule @xmath23 , from eq.([1c ] ) one obtains the equation of motion for the slope :    @xmath24    following the same line , the equation for the vertical component of the velocity can be deduced    @xmath25    note the higher order terms are disregarded in eq.([5 ] ) and the renormalized relaxation time @xmath26 depending on the stationary slope @xmath27 is introduced .",
    "eqs.([2 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) constitute the basis for self  consistent description of the sand flow on the surface with the slope @xmath28 driven by the control parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these equations is that nonlinear terms that enter eqs.([4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) are of opposite signs , while eq.([2 ] ) is linear .",
    "physically , the latter means that on the early stage the avalanche begins moving along the tangent @xmath21 .",
    "the negative sign of the last term in eq.([4 ] ) can be regarded as a manifestation of le chatelier principle , i.e. since an increase in the slope results in the formation of an avalanche , the velocity components @xmath29 and @xmath30 tend to impede the growth of the slope .",
    "the positive feedback between @xmath29 and @xmath28 in eq.([5 ] ) plays an important part in the problem . as we shall see later",
    ", it is precisely the reason behind the self  organization that brings about the avalanche generation .",
    "after suitable rescaling , eqs.([2 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) can be rewritten in the form of the well  known lorenz system :    [ 6 ] @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the dimensionless velocity components and the slope , respectively ; @xmath33 and the dot now stands for the derivatives with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath34 . in general , the system ( [ 6a ] )  ( [ 6c ] ) can not be solved analytically , but in the simplest case , where @xmath35 , the vertical velocity @xmath36 and the slope @xmath37 can be eliminated by making use of the adiabatic approximation that implies neglecting of the left hand sides of eqs.([6b ] ) , ( [ 6c ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the dependencies of @xmath37 and @xmath36 on the horizontal velocity @xmath38 are given by    @xmath39    note that , under @xmath38 is in the physically meaningful range between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the slope is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath38 , whereas the velocity @xmath36 increases with @xmath38 ( at @xmath42 we have @xmath43 and the flow of the sand becomes turbulent ) .",
    "substituting second eq.([7 ] ) into eq.([6a ] ) yields the landau ",
    "khalatnikov equation :    @xmath44    with the kinetic energy given by @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the @xmath38dependence of @xmath47 is monotonically increasing and the only stationary value of @xmath38 equals zero , @xmath48 , so that there is no avalanches in this case . if the slope @xmath49 exceeds the critical value , @xmath50 , the kinetic energy assumes the minimum with non ",
    "zero steady state velocity components @xmath51 and the slope @xmath52 .",
    "the above scenario represents supercritical regime of the avalanche formation and corresponds to the second  order phase transition .",
    "the latter can be easily seen from the expansion of the kinetic energy ( [ 9 ] ) in power series of @xmath53 .",
    "so the critical exponents are identical to those obtained within the framework of the mean field theory [ 11 ] .",
    "the drawback of the outlined approach is that it fails to account for the subcritical regime of the self ",
    "organization that is the reason for the appearance of avalanches and analogous to the first ",
    "order phase transition , rather than the second  order one .",
    "so one has to modify the above theory by taking the assumption that the effective relaxation time @xmath54 increases with velocity @xmath38 from value @xmath55 , @xmath56 to @xmath57 [ 12 ] .",
    "the simplest two ",
    "parameter approximation is    @xmath58    where @xmath59 .",
    "the expression for the kinetic energy ( [ 9 ] ) then changes by adding the term    @xmath60    and the stationary values of @xmath38 are    @xmath61^{1/2 } \\right)^{1/2 } , \\label{12}\\\\ 2u_{00}^{2}&\\equiv & ( s_{0}-1)+s_{c}u_{0}^{2},\\qquad s_{c}\\equiv1+m.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the upper sign in the right hand side of eq.([12 ] ) is for the value at the unstable state @xmath62 where the kinetic energy @xmath63 has the maximum , the lower one corresponds to the stable state @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding value of the stationary slope    @xmath65    smoothly increases from the value    @xmath66    at the parameter @xmath67 with    @xmath68    to the marginal value @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath49dependencies of @xmath71 are presented in fig.1 . as is shown in fig.1a , under the adiabatic condition @xmath72",
    "is met and the parameter @xmath49 slowly increases being below @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , no avalanches can form . at the point",
    "@xmath70 the velocity @xmath64 jumps upward to the value @xmath75 and its further smooth increase is determined by eq.([12 ] ) .",
    "if the parameter @xmath49 then goes downward the velocity @xmath64 continuously decreases up to the point , where @xmath76 . at this point",
    "the velocity jump  like goes down to zero . referring to fig.1b",
    ", the stationary slope @xmath77 shows a linear increase from @xmath40 to @xmath73 with the parameter @xmath49 being in the same interval and , after the jump down to the value @xmath78 at @xmath70 , @xmath79 smoothly decays to @xmath41 at @xmath80 . under",
    "the parameter @xmath49 then decreases from above @xmath73 down to @xmath81 the slope grows .",
    "when the point ( [ 15 ] ) is reached , the avalanche stops , so that the slope undergoes the jump from the value ( [ 14 ] ) up to the one defined by eq.([15 ] ) . for @xmath82 again the parameter @xmath79 does not differ from @xmath49 .",
    "note that this subcritical regime is realized provided the parameter @xmath83 , that enters the dispersion law ( [ 10 ] ) , is greater than @xmath84    clearly , according to the picture described , the avalanche generation is characterized by the well pronounced hysteresis , when the grains of sand initially being at rest begin to move downhill only if the slope of the surface exceeded its limiting value @xmath69 , whereas the slope @xmath81 needed to stop the avalanche is less than @xmath73 ( see eqs.([14 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) ) .",
    "this is the case in the limit @xmath85 and the hysteresis loop shrinks with the growth of the adiabaticity parameter @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to the smallness of @xmath87 , the adiabatic approximation implies the ratio @xmath88 is also small .",
    "in contrast to the former , the latter does not seem to be realistic for the system under consideration , where , in general , @xmath89 .",
    "so it is of interest to study to what extent the finite value of @xmath90 could change the results .",
    "owing to the condition @xmath91 , eq.([6c ] ) is still algebraic and @xmath37 can be expressed in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath36 . as a result",
    ", we derive the system of two nonlinear differential equations that can be studied by the phase portrait method [ 12 ] .",
    "the phase portraits for various values of @xmath90 are displayed in fig.2 , where the point o represents the stationary state and the point s is related to the maximum of the kinetic energy . as is seen from the figure , independently of @xmath90",
    ", there is the universal section that attracts all phase trajectories and its structure is appeared to be almost insensitive to changes in @xmath90 .",
    "analysis of time dependencies @xmath92 and @xmath93 reveals that the velocity components slow down appreciably on this section in comparison to the rest parts of trajectories that are almost rectilinear ( it is not difficult to see that this effect is caused by the smallness of @xmath87 ) . since the most of time the system is in vicinity of this universal section , we arrive at the conclusion that finite values of @xmath90 do not affect qualitatively the above results obtained in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "to take into account additive noises of the velocity components @xmath38 , @xmath36 and the slope @xmath37 it needs to add to right - hand parts of eqs.([6a ] )  ( [ 6c ] ) the stochastic terms @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , respectively ( here the noise intensities @xmath97 are measured in units @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , correspondingly , and @xmath101 is @xmath87-correlated stochastic function ) [ 13 ] . then , within the adiabatic approximation eq.([8 ] ) acquires the stochastic addition @xmath102 \\right\\}\\xi(t),\\ ] ] where we introduce the multiplicative functions @xmath103 . as a result the extreme points of the distribution @xmath104 of the stochastic variable @xmath38 is given by the effective energy [ 14 ] @xmath105 where the bare energy @xmath47 is determined by eq.([9 ] ) and the expression for the effective noise intensity @xmath106 follows from the known property of additivity of squares of variances of independent gaussian random quantities [ 13 ] .",
    "combining expressions ( [ 9 ] ) , ( [ vi.5_17 ] ) , ( [ vi.5_18 ] ) , we can find the explicit form of @xmath107 , which is too cumbersome to be reproduced here .",
    "much simpler is the equation @xmath108 which defines the locations of the maxima of distribution function @xmath109 .",
    "according to eq.([vi.5_19 ] ) , they are insensitive to changes in the intensity of noise @xmath110 of the velocity component @xmath38 , but are determined by the stationary value @xmath111 of the sandpile slope and the intensities @xmath112 , @xmath113 of the noises of vertical velocity component @xmath36 and slope @xmath37 , which acquire the multiplicative character in eq.([vi.5_18 ] ) . hence , it can put for simplicity @xmath114 and eqs.([9 ] ) , ( [ vi.5_17 ] ) , ( [ vi.5_18 ] ) give the follow expression for the effective energy : @xmath115 + i_s\\ln[g_s^2(u)+i g_v^2(u ) ] , \\quad i\\equiv{i_v / i_s}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to eq.([vi.5_19 ] ) , the effective energy ( [ vi.5_27 ] ) has a minimum at @xmath116 if the stationary slope @xmath111 does not exceed the critical level @xmath117 whose value increases at increasing intensity of noise of the sandpile slope , but decreases with one of the velocity . in this case ,",

    "then the action of the noise of the vertical component of the velocity @xmath36 is reduced to the renormalization of the extremum value of the horizontal one by the quantity @xmath146 , so that the region of divergence @xmath147 becomes inaccessible .",
    "the condition of extremum of the generalized energy ( [ vi.5_27 ] ) splits into two equations , one of which is simply @xmath148 , and the other is given by eq.([vi.5_19 ] ) .",
