    "the problem of phonon transport through dielectric wires of nanometer thickness @xcite is of special interest at present , since accurate measurements of thermal conduction in these systems begin to be available @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this problem has been considered by different approaches .",
    "some of these are the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) @xcite , molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite , and the transmission function approach @xcite .",
    "the bte has been succesfully used in nanowire transport at high temperatures , for systems where the resistive length of the wire is long enough for the transport to be diffusive .",
    "molecular dynamics has the advantage that it can accurately consider the anharmonic interactions between the atoms .",
    "md was applied to nanowires in ref .  , for example .",
    "it is nonetheless difficult to study low temperatures using md , since it provides a classical description of the system .",
    "the transmission function approach is very well suited to study cases when phonons flow ballistically or semi - ballistically . in the limit of very low temperatures",
    ", an elastic continuum model provides a good description of the phonon flow .",
    "this model has yielded new insight into the problem of phonon scattering by surface roughness , for example , where the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport @xcite and the low temperature `` dip '' in the quantized thermal conductance @xcite have been investigated .",
    "transmission function approaches have also been succesfully applied to study the heat flow through a mesoscopic link @xcite , a nanocristal @xcite , and monatomic chains @xcite . despite these excellent works , and unlike the case of electron transport , the use of the transmission function approach in phonon transport is still scarce .    in this paper",
    "we develop a novel transmission function approach , and apply it to study a problem that has not been theoretically investigated before : the phonon transport along nanowires in which part of the length is surrounded by a thick coating of amorphous material .",
    "this is an important problem , since most dielectric nanowires are naturally coated by a layer of amorphous material @xcite .",
    "after explaining the general formalism , its use is illustrated by the study of phonon transmission through two concrete systems : a 1-d chain partially coated with an amorphous layer , and real 3-d nanowires with part of their length coated by a silica layer .",
    "three main phenomena are investigated :    -the transition from ballistic to diffussive transport .",
    "explicit curves are shown of how this transition takes place , as a function of frequency and coated length .",
    "-the low temperature conductance .",
    "it is found that a phenomenon similar to the `` dip '' occuring in rough - edge uncoated wires @xcite , occurs also in amorphous coated wires , although displaying some differences with respect to the former case .",
    "-the effect of the wire - coating interface .",
    "we find an interesting saturation effect as a function of the coupling strength between the atoms at the interface .",
    "we also show the important influence of the interatomic link number and configuration on the phonon transmission .",
    "our approach is also new in many respects :    \\1 ) an atomistic description is used .",
    "this is necessary since we are interested in how the atomic structure of the interface between the wire and the coating affects transport .",
    "this also enables to consider the whole dispersive spectrum , and not only the lower frequencies .",
    "although excellent atomistic investigation of transport through monatomic chains was done in ref .  , we have not been able to find any other transmission function atomistic study of larger systems , like the si nanowires considered here . despite the method is similar to that of tight binding electron transport , it is important to provide a complete and independent derivation of the formulas in the phonon framework , specially for those readers not familiar with the theory of electron transport .",
    "part of the paper is devoted to do this in detail .",
    "\\2 ) we present a new method that allows to treat the amorphous overlayer in an efficient manner .",
    "as we will see , the presence of the amorphous overlayer introduces a problem of overwhelming computational demand .",
    "we develop a technique that is able to yield the thermal conductance in the limit of thick overlayer , with much less computational effort . the validity of this approach is explicitly shown with one example .    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] explains the formalism .",
    "an introduction to the transmission function concept ( sect .",
    "[ sec : trans ] ) is followed by the core of the method , section  [ sec : calc ] , where we derive the formulas to compute the phonon transmission function .",
    "afterwards , section  [ sec : scflux ] describes the specific self - consistent technique that enables us to treat the amorphous coating surrounding the wires .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows results for the two examples treated .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "both the thermal conductivity and the thermal conductance can be obtained by the same single approach .",
    "let us imagine a perfectly harmonic and translationally invariant nanowire , totally free of defects .",
    "the wire is free standing , so that there is no heat leakage from the boundary .",
    "the harmonicity assumption implies that , unless there is scattering due to disordered defects or impurities , the thermal conductance of the whole wire would be independent of its length .",
    "in this situation , the heat flux associated with a small temperature difference @xmath0 between the two wire ends is given by the sum of the contributions of the individual phononic subbands @xcite :    @xmath1 \\nonumber \\times { \\partial\\omega_\\alpha\\over\\partial k}\\hbar \\omega_\\alpha ( k ) { dk\\over 2\\pi } \\\\",

    "we note that the phonons inside the wire have a non equilibrium distribution different from the the bose - einstein type .",
    "as it is clear from the second line , it is not necessary to know the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath5 , but only the frequency limits of the subband .",
    "the ( length independent ) thermal conductance for this limit is then @xmath10   \\hbar\\omega { d\\omega\\over 2\\pi}. \\label{eq : sigmasat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general , however , one has a nanowire with disordered scattering sources along a finite length . in such a case we no longer have translational periodicity , and we can not define anything like a `` phonon band dispersion '' . nevertheless , the concept of transmission channels is still valid .",
    "as it was shown by landauer @xcite , no matter how scatterers are distributed in the system , one can always calculate a transmission function , @xmath11 , which describes the propagation of quasiparticles between two reservoirs connected to the system , with different chemical potentials .",
    "in contrast to translationally periodic systems , where the conduction channels always yield integer quanta of transmission , now the waves can be partially reflected resulting in non integral transmissions . thus in this case , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmasat ] ) , we have @xmath12   \\hbar\\omega { d\\omega\\over 2\\pi } , \\label{eq : conductance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the phonon spectrum extends between frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "( [ eq : conductance ] ) is of general validity and involves no approximations .",
    "( this equation is rigorously derived in section  [ sec : totalcurrent ] . ) in the next subsection we explain how @xmath15 is calculated exactly for independent phonons .",
    "scattering causes the conductance to vary with the nanowire s length . for 3-d systems in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the conductance varies inversely proportional to the system s length , @xmath16 . because of this one usually defines a `` conductivity '' , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sample s cross section .",

    ", @xmath19 saturates to @xmath21 . for long @xmath16",

    "is explained in the next subsection .",
    "the system s motion is determined by its dynamical matrix , obtained from the interatomic potentials of the system @xcite .",
    "the nondiagonal elements of the dynamical matrix @xmath22 are calculated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy , and @xmath25 is the displacement of the @xmath26 degree of freedom with respect to its equilibrium value .",

    "the dynamical equation of the system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a diagonal matrix with elements corresponding to the masses of the constituent atoms , and @xmath8 is the vibrational frequency .",
    "this problem is analogous to that posed by a non - orthogonal hamiltonian in the case of electrons , if we replace the energy , hamiltonian , and overlap , by the square frequency , dynamical matrix , and mass matrix , respectively @xcite .",
    "the presence of matrix @xmath30 instead of the identity matrix introduces mathematical difficulties , if green functions are used .",
    "the issue has been elegantly dealt with in the theory of non - orthogonal tight binding @xcite : the `` non - orthogonal '' problem is equivalent to the `` orthogonal '' one @xmath31 the elements of the `` orthogonalized '' dynamical matrix elements are explicitly defined , as @xmath32 and the dynamic equation is recast as @xmath33 which now can be treated using green function methods .      we are faced with the problem of calculating the local heat flow .",
    "the following paragraphs derive the necessary equations .",
    "the section following this one will express all the equations in terms of green functions , so that there is no need to calculate individual wave functions .    let us consider an arbitrary wave ( not necessarily an eigensolution ) @xmath34 , propagating in the system .",

    "it is not feasible to explicitly compute the eigenfunctions @xmath72 for a semi - infinite system .",

    "( [ eq : transmission ] ) and ( [ eq : current ] ) to calculate thermal currents .",
    "the system we are treating is infinitely extended in the heat propagation direction , but it does not have translational symmetry .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the green functions requires the use of projection techniques . the most efficient way to obtain the green function of the semi - infinite systems 1 and 2 projected at subsystems @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath51 is to use the decimation technique @xcite , which is based in a renormalization procedure .",
    "after the @xmath66 and @xmath67 are calculated in this way , one can calculate the total retarded green function of the system everywhere in subsystem 3 ( fig .",

    "if we know the dynamical matrix , the formalism explained in the previous paragraphs is capable of accounting for any type of scattering mechanism other than anharmonicity ( for the role played by anharmonicity , see appendix ) .",
    "it is straighforward to include isotopes by varying the mass of given atoms ; substitutional impurities may be introduced by varying both the mass of selected atoms and the links to their neighbors ; vacancies would be included by removing single atoms and allowing the system to relax ; etc .",
    "we might thus be tempted to treat boundary scattering in this same spirit , by including surface adsorbates or imperfections that can lead to effective boundary scattering in the nanowire . adding single adsorbed impurities",
    "is a rather simple matter , but , could one consider an amorphous overlayer on the same footing ?",
    "for example , it is known that si nanowires are covered by an amorphous @xmath82 overlayer , several @xmath83 in thickness @xcite , and it is important to know how this overlayer affects the phonon scattering .",
    "a brute force approach would be to input the atomic positions of all constituents in the silica overlayer , as well as the wire , and then calculate the dynamical matrix of the whole system and compute its transmission .",
    "this procedure , however , is a nearly impossible task in practice .",
    "the added overlayer considerably increases the size of the system , and it also results in an extremely irregular transmission function , which has to be computed at a very large number of different frequencies .",
    "the integration of such a transmission in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conductance ] ) , consequently , becomes cumbersome . to solve these difficulties ,",
    "we have developed the self - consistent flux model .",
    "this model s basic idea consists in taking the limit of an infinitely thick overlayer . in the same spirit of the bethe lattice approach ,",
    "as used for amorphous materials @xcite , we consider the nanowire connected to bethe lattice branches of the amorphous material ( see fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) .",
    "the phonon mean free path in amorphous materials is of the order of the interatomic spacing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lack of connectivity in the bethe lattice approach does not represent a problem .",
    "the adequacy of the bethe lattice approach for the study of amorphous systems has been investigated in refs .  .",
    "when the overlayer is substituted by an infinitely thick one , an essential difference appears .",
    "now , the self - energies associated to the overlayer do not correspond to clusters .",
    "therefore , they no longer are purely real , but contain a finite continuous imaginary part . in other words , if one calculates the transmission of the system by eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmission ] ) , part of the phonon flux will be effectively lost through the side branches , since now they are infinite and allow for the current to go away without returning .",
    "however , this is not physically correct , for we know that the overlayer is finite and the heat current must eventually come back to the wire and escape through the contacts . in a steady state , this means that we must allow for an equivalent ammount of phonon flux to re - enter the system through each of the side branches .",
    "one may find a self - consistent solution to this problem in the form of an iterative procedure .",
    "this is indeed not necessary , for the self - consistent solution can be directly found by an algebraic method , as we show below .    to clarify the nomenclature in the following discussion , a general scheme of the nanowire with part of its length coated",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ chain ] , left .",
    "the represented nanowire is three dimensional , thus each black dot in the figure stands for a group of atoms , and each line joining dots stands for a set of interatomic links . the dotted line encloses the wire s groups of atoms that are coated .",
    "bethe lattices are attached to those groups of atoms , as shown in the figure .",
    "phonons enter the system through group @xmath84 , and exit at the other lead through group @xmath61 .",
    "first of all , we obtain the partial transmissivities , @xmath85 , between every pair of branches in the system , using eq .",

    "@xmath89 is the number of degrees of freedom in node @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "( all nodes are assumed to contain the same number of atoms for simplicity . )",
    "we recall that each link to a branch in fig .",
    "[ chain ] may comprise interactions with several atoms , in the three geometrical directions , so the green functions above are matrices .",
    "the transmissivity from one branch to itself is not defined by the above formula .",
    "instead , we must define it as the reflectivity , @xmath90    we define the `` injected '' and `` outflowing '' flux arrays , @xmath91 and @xmath92 as the fluxes coming `` into '' and `` out of '' the system via its surrounding nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) .",
    "the total flux array , @xmath93 , is then @xmath94 and it must fulfill @xmath95 because all the flux coming in through node @xmath84 must finally exit through node @xmath61 . also , there is no flux injection from node @xmath61 , so @xmath96    all the other modes must fulfill @xmath97    we can express eqs .",
    "( [ eq : one],[eq : three],[eq : four ] ) in matrix form as @xmath98 with @xmath99    on the other hand , the outflowing currents are related to the injected ones by @xmath100 which implies @xmath101    therefore , the self - consistent array @xmath102 is proportional to the eigenvector @xmath103 of @xmath104 with eigenvalue @xmath84 , such that @xmath105 .",

    "the transmission corresponds to the outgoing flux at node @xmath61 when there is one unit of flux inciding per degree of freedom in node @xmath84 .",

    "( [ eq : transmission ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that the scflux approach yields the same result that the calculation using large clusters attached to the wire .",
    "therefore , the scflux technique is of tremendous importance , since it enables to study the otherwise untractable problem of thermal transport through thick - amorphous - coated real wires .",
    "new physics regarding how the amorphous coating influences the thermal transport through a wire can now be learnt using the above method : does the coating affect all frequencies equally , or are there important differences in the scattering as a function of frequency ? does diffusive transport arise ? and , if so , how long a segment has to be coated in order for transport to diffusive rather than ballistic ?",
    "how does transport depend on the coupling at the wire - coating interface ?",
    "etc .    in the next two subsections we present results for two different systems .",
    "first , a one dimensional model , which is simple enough to allow for a thorough investigation without encountering size limitations , and at the same time displays many general features that apply to real systems .",
    "afterwards , we present results for real 3-d silicon nanowires .",
    "a wide range of interesting phenomena is obtained already in the case where there is only one degree of freedom per atom , in a linear chain .",
    "bethe lattices with also one degree of freedom per atom are attached to a section of the chain .",
    "the wire s properties are determined by the value of a spring constant @xmath111 . for the bethe lattices ,",
    "we assume them to be linear chains ( i.e. @xmath112 in the nomenclature of ref . ) , and they are characterized by their spring constant @xmath113 .",
    "the third constant involved is the coating - wire interaction , @xmath114 , connecting the end of the bethe lattice to the wire .",
    "first of all , we provide a particular example that demonstrates the equivalence between the scflux calculation , and the much more computationally demanding calculation using large finite clusters for the coating .",
    "the transmission was computed for a system with ten clusters attached to it at ten consecutive atoms .",
    "each of the clusters is composed of sixty overlayer atoms .",
    "the transmission , calculated via eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmission ] ) , is shown in fig .  [ cluster](a ) .",
    "we shall abbreviately refer to this curve as the `` cluster transmission '' .",

    "thus we see that the transmission calculated with the scflux method does indeed yield the same thermal conductance as if we include the thick coating in the form of large finite clusters .",
    "but the scflux method requires a much smaller computation , because it yields a smooth transmission curve , while the cluster calculation needs to evaluate a far larger number of points in order to account for the closely spaced antiresonant structure associated to the finite clusters .    to quantify the difference between the _",
    "real _ conductance and the one obtained using a _ frequency independent _ boundary scattering , the latter is also plotted in fig .",

    "more concretely , we want to know how the transmission depends on frequency @xmath8 , coated length @xmath16 , and strength of the interface spring constant @xmath114 . the analysis will show us how the system goes from ballistic to diffusive behavior , as a function of these physical parameters .",

    "[ trvsfreq ] ( for @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) .",
    "we notice that the effect of boundary scattering is to reduce the transmission rather uniformly throughout the whole frequency range .",
    "however , it is apparent that the usual assumption of a constant scattering rate @xcite is only a rough approximation to the real scattering in nanowires .",
    "the low frequency limit behavior displays an important feature : for wires where the coated segment is long enough ( @xmath131 in the case shown ) , the transmission near @xmath132 decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "this appears to be the general case , as we will see in the next section .",
    "it has a direct physical consequence : the slope of thermal conductance at very low temperatures decreases below its @xmath133 value when temperature increases .",
    "this fact has been shown to happen also in the case of surface roughness at non - coated wires @xcite ( the well known `` dip '' of ref .. ) we explicitly show this for si nanowires in the next subsection .    in fig .",
    "[ trvsfreq ] we have seen that the shape of the transmission function varies as a function of the coated length .",
    "does it attain a limiting shape ?",
    "and , how is this limit reached ?",
    "this is the subject of the _ diffusive - ballistic transition_. the way it takes place will become clear from the study of the transmission as a function of coated length , @xmath16 . in principle , it is not obvious what type of length dependence one could expect .",
    "for pure disorder , for example , an exponential decrease in transmission is obtained in 1-d systems due to localization @xcite . as another example",
    ", for wires with rough edges , an anomalous @xmath134 thermal conductance has also been reported under certain conditions @xcite . for amorphous - coated wires ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior turns out to be @xmath135 , as we now show .",
    "analogously to ref .  , we write the transmission as @xmath136 this is merely a definition of @xmath137 , and it does not impose any limitations on the form of the transmission . for the present 1-d system ,",
    "the uncoated wire s transmission , @xmath138 , is equal to @xmath84 at all frequencies .",
    "now , the form of @xmath137 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] , tells us the length dependence of the transmission .",
    "new physical insight can be gained from this figure .",
    "first , we see that @xmath137 quickly tends to an asymptotic value .",
    "this means that , for amorphously coated wires , the long @xmath16 behavior of the transmission follows an @xmath139 dependence .",
    "more interestingly , the length it takes @xmath137 to saturate to its asymptotic value becomes longer as the frequency gets closer to zero .",
    "physically , this implies that the lowest frequency phonons can still travel nearly ballistically for system lengths at which higher frequency phonons are transported in an almost totally diffusive fashion . in a practical measurement of nanowire thermal conductivity , this might lead to a wrong estimation of the low temperature thermal conductivity , if the wire were not long enough .    in the diffusive regime",
    ", we can define a frequency dependent relaxation length , @xmath140 , as the limit @xmath141 a very interesting phenomenon arises when we study how this relaxation length depends on the strength of the spring constants coupling the wire to the amorphous coating .",
    "we numerically computed @xmath140 at frequency @xmath142 , as a function of the wire - coating coupling strength .",
    "the result is plotted in fig.[condvsstrength ] . for decreasing values of the wire - coating coupling , @xmath114 ,",
    "the relaxation length quickly increases , as expected . however ,",
    "if the coupling is made stronger , @xmath140 reaches a minimum and then it increases again as the coupling is increased , approaching an asymptotic value .",
    "the existence of this _ minimum relaxation length _ can be interpretted in microscopic terms : there is an optimum value of the coupling that maximizes the heat - flow exchange to and from the coating , thus maximizing the scattering .",
    "for very weak couplings the heat - flow exchange reduction is intuitively obvious .",
    "for very strong couplings on the other hand , the linked atoms would behave more like a rigid cluster , thus acting as a hard wall that also confines the phonons to the wire rather than let them enter the amorphous region . from a macroscopic point of view , the relaxation length is minimum when the specularity factor is 0 , in the casimir limit @xcite .",
    "the minimum of @xmath140 obtained thus translates to this limit , and specularity increases in both ways around this point as a function of @xmath114 .",
    "the advantage of the atomistic description used in this paper is that we can study wires made of `` real '' materials .",
    "in other words , we are dealing with the real phonon spectrum of the system : the bands are dispersive , and their frequency extension is finite , in contrast with the infinitely extended spectrum in a continuum elastic system .",
    "we proceed to study the transmission of phonons in real si nanowires , with an amorphous material coating the wire .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations of si are fairly well reproduced with an interatomic potential that includes only two and three body terms .",
    "we use harrison s potential @xcite .",
    "the adequacy of this potential for si is assesed by the satisfactory dispersion relations calculated with it .",
    "we show them for bulk si in fig .",
    "[ disprel ] . despite having only two parameters ,",
    "the shape and position of the bands are in reasonably good agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the two body contribution to the energy is @xmath143 for every pair of nearest neighbors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath144 is the distance between the atoms and @xmath145 is the lattice equilibrium distance .",
    "the three body contribution is @xmath146 for every pair of bonds joining atoms @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath5 , where @xmath147 is the deviation with respect to the equilibrium angle between the two bonds in the lattice .",
    "constants @xmath148 and @xmath149 are taken from table 9 - 1 of ref .  .",
    "for the coating we again consider bethe lattices connected to each vibrational coordinate of the boundary atoms .",
    "the parameters of the bethe lattice are chosen to reproduce the frequency range of the known d.o.s .",
    "of silica @xcite , i.e. @xmath150 hz .",
    "a coordination number @xmath151 is assumed .",
    "we have considered ( 011 ) wires of three different widths , shown in fig .",
    "[ crosssect ] .",
    "the wires are coated by attaching bethe lattices only to the outermost atoms .",
    "for the 2x2 wire all atoms are at the surface .",
    "the 3x3 wire has 16 surface atoms and 2 core atoms .",
    "the 4x4 wire has 24 surface atoms and 8 core atoms .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations for each of them is shown in fig .",
    "[ wdisp ] .",
    "the procedure for the calculation is as follows .",
    "first , the nanowire lattice is defined , and the dynamical matrix is obtained for the periodic unit cell , and for the link between two neighboring unit cells .",
    "the bethe lattices are included as a self - energy projected onto their last atom .",
    "the self - energy due to the uncoated parts of the wire is calculated in the way of ref .  .",
    "then the green function of the system is calculated ( eq .  ( [ eq : green ] ) ) .",
    "the partial transmissivity between each pair of branches ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : partialcond ] ) ) is then calculated , and the scflux transmission ( eq .  ( [ eq : sctransmission ] ) ) is computed .",
    "we show how the phonon transmission depends on frequency , for different values of the coated length .",
    "[ sitrans ] shows @xmath11 as the coated length increases from 0 to 5 coated unit cells . in these curves ,",
    "all three spatial directions of each of the surface atoms are attached to bethe lattices .",
    "the qualitative behavior is an overall uniform decrease of the transmission curve , that maintains the peaks and curve features of the uncoated wire .",
    "this is in agreement with the usual assumption of a constant scattering rate .",
    "however , quantitatively the boundary scattering rate is not frequency independent , as it is apparent from the relative heights of the peaks at different coating lengths . in the absence of coating ,",
    "the transmission curve at the lower end of the frequency spectrum has a value of @xmath152 .",
    "this is always the case , since there are four lowest frequency branches at all nanowires : one dilatational , one torsional and two flexural branches @xcite .",
    "the two flexural branches have a quadratic rather than linear dispersion , as we can see in fig .",
    "( [ wdisp ] ) , being a consequence of the soft character of those modes .    the transmission at the lowest frequency decreases more slowly than that around the first peak ( @xmath153 ) , as the coated length becomes larger .",
    "thus scattering is weaker for the lowest lying modes than for the bulk of transverse modes .",
    "this results in a flattening of the transmission as @xmath16 increases .",
    "the narrower the wire , the more pronounced this effect becomes .",
    "the low frequency behavior of the transmission function also has important physical implications .",
    "similarly as what we saw in the 1-d example of section  [ sec:1dwire ] . , for real si nanowires the transmission function also decreases below its @xmath154 value for small values of the frequency , and increases again as the frequency rises further ( see inset in fig .  [ lowtemp ] ) .",
    "the result is that , at low , finite temperatures , the thermal conductance divided by @xmath155 decreases with respect to its zero temperature value , thus displaying a dip ( see fig .",
    "[ lowtemp ] ) .",
    "a dip in @xmath156 has been reported in ref .  , and theoretically explained in ref .   to be the result of surface roughness scattering .",
    "in our case of amorphous - coated nanowires we see that an analogous dip occurs , although the system considered here is basically different from that one , and the conductance reduction phenomenon can not be considered to be the same one .",
    "some essential differences exist in the case of scattering by amorphous coating with repect to the roughness scattering case .",
    "one is that , at zero frequency , the scattering rate is zero in the case of roughness scattering , while it is different than zero in the case of amorphous - coating scattering . as a result , it is possible to measure a conductance close to 4 times the quantum of conductance at uncoated wires , but for wires with a thick amorphous coating the measurement will in general yield smaller values at the very low temperature limit .",
    "another difference pointed out earlier is the exponential decrease of conductance with length in the rough wires , as compared with the inversely proportional dependence in the long length limit for amorphous - coated wires .",
    "we have also calculated the relaxation length , @xmath140 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanfp ] ) ) , as a function of the bethe lattice coverage , in fig .  [ meanfreepath ] .",
    "the abscissa corresponds to the number of bethe lattices attached to each pair of surface atoms of the 4x4 nanowire .",
    "since there are three spatial directions , we can attach up to 6 lattices to each of the pairs .",
    "we show @xmath140 as a function of the number of directions attached , for different ways of attachment . the directions in which the bethe lattices are attached , and the number of them , are depicted schematically near the points in the graph .",
    "the calculation shows that the relaxation length is strongly dependent on the character of the bonding to the coating material . for a densely covered wire ,",
    "the relaxation length becomes of the order of the wire s core diameter . on the other hand ,",
    "if the surface bonds to the coating are less dense , with one dominant direction and two much weaker links in the other two directions , then the relaxation length can attain values between 2 and 4 times the diameter . when there is only partial bonding of part of the surface atoms , the relaxation length increases further .",
    "the way in which @xmath157 approaches its saturation value , @xmath140 is shown in the inset of fig .  [ meanfreepath ] . with only one link per surface atom ( solid curve ) ,",
    "it is necessary to coat a considerable length in order to attain the diffusive limit . with more interface links ,",
    "the diffusive limit is reached at shorter coated lengths .",
    "it is observed that , not only the number of links , but also their orientation , has an influence in the relaxation length .    a larger number of interface links does not necessarily imply a shorter relaxation length . a fully covered surface with three links per atom , for example , displays a larger relaxation length than a surface with only half of the surface atoms directly attached to the coating ( fig .",
    "[ meanfreepath ] ) .",
    "this is another manifestation of the phenomenon noted in subsection  [ sec:1dwire ] , where we saw that a very strong interaction between wire and coating can result in longer relaxation lengths .",
    "we have presented a formalism to calculate the phonon transmission function of an atomically described system . with this formalism",
    "we have studied the problem of phonon transport in nanowires with part of their length coated by an amorphous material .",
    "a self - consistent approach has been developed that uses bethe lattices to treat the amorphous material .",
    "the efficiency of the approach , and its equivalence to a much more computationally demanding cluster calculation , have been explicitly illustrated via direct comparison , by an example .",
    "we have studied two examples of amorphous - coated wires : a 1-d model , and silica coated si nanowires . in the examples studied , specific physical phenomena for coated systems have arosen :    \\1 ) _ ballistic - diffusive transition : _ we explicitly showed the evolution of the phonon transmission in the transitional regime , before @xmath158 asymptotically approaches its limiting value . in the limit of long coated length",
    "the transmission attains a @xmath20 behavior .",
    "( in contrast , for rough - boundary uncoated wires , an exponential decrease with length takes place @xcite . )",
    "\\2 ) _ low temperature conductance : _ near @xmath154 , the transmission is found to decrease with respect to its @xmath154 value , as the frequency is increased . as a result , amorphous - coated wires display a low temperature dip in the plot of the thermal conductance divided by temperature , having certain similarities with the dip reported for rough uncoated wires @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) _ coating - wire interface structure effects : _ a new phenomenon is found , which is specific of coated wires : as the interatomic bonds between wire and coating atoms are made stronger , starting from zero , the transmission of a long coated wire ( or equivalently , @xmath159 ) decreases , but only up to a certain limit ; once the bond strength reaches a certain threshold , the transmission _ increases _ again as the bond is made stronger .",
    "when the bond strength tends to infinity the relaxation length asymptotically saturates to a finite value .",
    "an analogous behavior was found to take place as a function of the number of interface links .",
    "the structure of the interface was shown to have an important effect on the relaxation length .",
    "it is hoped that the method and results presented here will help to estimulate further atomistic research in the field of phonon transmission through nanowires , as well as experimental research on amorphous - coated nanowires .",
    "we acknowledge toshishige yamada for valuable comments on the manuscript , and also a.  balandin and p.  schelling for useful discussions .",
    "in one dimension , there is no three phonon anharmonic scattering , since it is not possible to have a process in which all three phonons belong to the same polarization branch @xcite .",
    "therefore , anharmonicity is not an issue in the first example , given in section  [ sec:1dwire ] .",
    "the role of anharmonicity in the thermal conductivity of si nanowires has been studied in ref .  .",
    "for the wires studied in section  [ sec : sinanow ] , its influence is negligible .",
    "an estimation can be made using the mathiessen rule .",
    "the total relaxation length , expressed in terms of the boundary and anharmonic relaxation lengths , is : @xmath160 now , @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the system s thickness ( around 2 nm , for the wires considered here ) .",
    "also , @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the si speed of sound @xcite .",
    "the role of anharmonicity is largest for the highest frequencies .",
    "but even for the highest frequency available in si , @xmath165  thz , the anharmonic relaxation length at room temperature is still @xmath166  nm . this , in the case of the nanowires of section  [ sec : sinanow ] , using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : appendix ] ) and the estimate just given for @xmath167 , affects the transmission by less than 10% .",
    "( lower frequencies are much less affected . )",
    "the influence on the thermal conductivity is much smaller than this , since high modes contribute significantly less than the lower energy modes .",
    "experimentally it has been observed that even for nanowires 37 nm thick , the effect of anharmonicity on the thermal conductivity is minimal compared to that of boundary scattering , up to 300k .",
    "this is evident from the fact that the thermal conductivity stays constant with t near room temperature , rather than decrease ( see refs .  ) .    1 - 100 yi cui , lincoln j. lauhon , mark s. gudiksen , jianfang wang , and charles m. lieber , appl .",
