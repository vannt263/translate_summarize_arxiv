    "( 1999 ) confirm the 1998 results . taken together , these data now appear to be showing the cosmic ionization of helium by quasars around redshift 3 .",
    "although it is possible that the medium is already ionized to heiii by other sources at a lower level ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "all of the objects show absorption with mean @xmath7 at redshifts lower than the quasar . for the higher redshift qso s q0302 - 033 and pks 1935 - 692 ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) there is a clear shelf of @xmath8 in a wavelength region of order 20  in observed wavelength blueward of the quasar emission line redshift , dropping to a level consistent with zero flux or @xmath9 beyond that .",
    "the sharp edge led anderson et al . to conclude that gas initially containing helium as mostly heii was being double - ionized in a region around the quasars .",
    "the lack of a strong emission line for heii ly@xmath1 suggests that ionizing flux is escaping so that the 228  flux may be similar to a simple power - law extension of the observed 304  rest frame flux .",
    "hogan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used the same reasoning to estimate the time required for quasars to create the double ionized helium region to be 20 myr for a 20  shelf ( dependent on the hubble parameter , spectral hardness , cosmology , baryon density and the shelf size ) .",
    "the features present in heii ly@xmath1 spectra are reflected in the hi ly@xmath1 forest for these quasars .",
    "attempts to model the heii absorption with line systems detected in hi suggest that very low column hi absorbers , difficult to differentiate from noise in hi spectra , provide a substantial contribution to the heii absorption .",
    "typically , in the shelf region , the ratio of heii to hi ions is of order 20 or more , rising to at least 100 farther away ( the cross - section for heii ly@xmath1 absorption is 1/4 that of hi ) .",
    "both pks 1935 - 692 and he 2347 - 4342 display conspicuous voids in the heii absorption near the apparent edge of the heiii bubble with corresponding voids in the hi spectra .",

    "wadsley , hogan & anderson ( 1999 ) presented numerical models of the onset of full helium reionization around a single quasar .",
    "the models integrated one - dimensional radiative transfer along lines of sight taken from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and used flux levels comparable to pks 1935 - 692 . the results reinforced the basic intepretation of pks 1935 - 692 by hogan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as the growth of an he iii bubble over time in a medium that was mostly heii .",
    "in addition void recoveries in the large ionized bubbles similar to that observed for pks 1935 - 692 occurred often among a random set of simulated lines of sight .",
    "the gas temperature in such bubbles is strongly affected by the ionization of he ii to he iii , particularly because the first photons to reach much of the gas will be quite hard since the softer photons are absorbed close to the quasar until the gas is optically thin .",
    "in particular the underdense medium reaches temperatures of order 15000k .",
    "we make a simple analytical argument for this result in the next section .",
    "given our fairly good guess as to the physical conditions near pks 1935 - 692 we are in position to attempt to convert the observed optical depths into a density in baryons .",
    "comparing optical depths measured for the small sample of voids in the shelf region of pks 1935 - 692 to distributions of void widths and densities from simulations we can build an estimate of @xmath0 , the total cosmic density in baryons .",
    "the are still uncontrollable systematic uncertainties in this estimate but these differ from other techniques and can be addressed with better simulations and a larger sample of quasars .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the technique .",
    "in he ii ly@xmath1 absorption spectra only the voids are sufficiently low density to allow measurements of the optical depth .",
    "the highly ionized void gas is optically thin to the ionizing radiation and cool enough to ignore collisional effects , resulting in a fairly simple relation between optical depth and gas density ,    where @xmath10 is the optical depth for absorption of he ii ly@xmath1 , @xmath11 is the number density of he ii ions , @xmath12 converts from real space to wavelength ( velocity ) space and @xmath13 is the gas density .",
    "the recombination rate @xmath14 contains the only temperature dependence .",
    "the photo - ionizations per second @xmath15 is determined from the rest frame heii ionizing flux , @xmath16 can be extrapolated from the rest frame flux at @xmath17 which is estimated ( assuming a cosmological model ) from the observed continuum flux at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the redshift of the quasar .",
    "the fraction of heii depends on temperature roughly as @xmath20 through the recombination coefficient .",
    "the radiative transfer models of wadsley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gave temperatures around 15000k for the underdense gas near quasars .",
    "the optical depth to a he ii ionizing photon travelling @xmath21 ( the size of the pks 1935 - 692 shelf region ) at redshift @xmath2 ( scdm , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) is approximately @xmath24 .",
    "the optical depth falls to 1 for photons with energies , @xmath25 .",
    "thus the heii in the outer half of the shelf region will be ionized preferentially by photons in the energy range 100 - 200 ev . injecting 100 - 54.4",
    "ev per helium atom is equivalent to a temperature increase of 13000 k when the energy is distributed among all the particles .",
    "the cooling time for the underdense gas is very long , dominated by adiabatic expansion .",
    "gas elsewhere will gain @xmath26 4000 k due to heiii reionization .",
    "as voids evolve they approach an attractor solution resembling empty universes and their relative growth slows when they reach around @xmath27 times the mean density , making that value fairly representative .",
    "we used @xmath28-body simulations of 3 cosmologies ( standard cdm , open cdm and @xmath5cdm ) to get probability distributions for the quantity we label normalized opacity @xmath29 as a function of void width .",
    "@xmath30 may be directly related to the void optical depths via ( [ opacity ] ) .",
    "the set of voids allows a statistical maximum likelihood comparison of the simulated distribution of @xmath30 to the distribution of void widths and optical depths observed .",
    "figure  [ taunorm ] shows the probability distribution of @xmath30 in voids ( equivalent to void optical depth ) and void widths for the @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "the optical depth from the simulation was normalized so that mean density gas expanding with the hubble flow gives an optical depth of 1.0 .",
    "the effect of gas pressure on the dynamics of gas in the voids should be negligible and was ignored in our simulations .",
    "thus the gas follows the dark matter exactly .",
    "the simulations were performed using hydra ( couchman 1991 ) with 64 mpc periodic simulation volumes ( @xmath31 @xmath32 at @xmath2 ) containing @xmath33 particles .",
    "a preliminary convergence study indicated that the statistics of @xmath30 are relatively insensitive to resolution however our resolution is still lower than that of the best current lyman-@xmath1 forest studies which also include gas .",
    "we were constrained by the need to include larger scales so that the large void portion of our sample was reasonable .",
    "higher resolution gives slightly larger estimates for @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath30 that has the maximum likelihood gives an estimate for the total baryon density as follows , @xmath34 in this equation all the quantities are given as ratios with typical values estimated from pks 1935 - 692 , with @xmath35 being the local density divided by the cosmological mean density , @xmath36 the local expansion rate along the line - of - sight compared to the mean , @xmath37 local hubble parameter value , @xmath1 the spectral slope of the quasar ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 the helium mass fraction .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is @xmath41 at @xmath2 for an @xmath42 scdm cosmology .",
    "the exact systemic redshift of pks 1935 - 692 is uncertain due to an absence of narrow ir emission lines .",
    "we use @xmath43 .",
    "we used the 5 large voids observed over the range @xmath44 for pks  1935 - 692 .",
    "this range should be far enough from the quasar to avoid `` associated '' absorbers caught in the quasar outflow .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ taufit ] .",
    "he ii and h i absorption are both plotted with the models for each overplotted as dashed lines .",
    "the he ii spectrum was modeled with the known hi ly@xmath1 absorption lines and 5 parameter values for the optical depth in each void .",
    "the ratio of the hi to heii optical depths was a sixth free parameter .",
    "the models were convolved with the same spectral point spread function as the observations and include same level of photon shot noise .",
    "the best model was determined using maximum likelihood and the fitting errors determined with monte carlo realizations .",
    "the emptiest void has a reasonable probability according to the simulations , however since it has been suggested that it could be due to a local ionizing source we calculated the effect of removing it , which was a @xmath45 increase in the estimate for @xmath0 .",
    "the ionizing flux was inferred from the observed pks 1935 - 692 continuum level at 304 @xmath46 rest frame and extrapolated to @xmath47 and 228 @xmath46 . assuming the quasar redshift is @xmath43 this gives a flux of @xmath48 ( for standard cdm ) at @xmath49 which is in the middle of the voids .",
    "the sample of helium quasars is quite small and though pks 1935 - 692 does not have any known variability all quasars are thought to be intrinsically variable due to the nature of the fueling and emission processes .",
    "selection effects favour the idea that pks 1935 - 692 is currently brighter than its average value over the last few thousand years ( the ionization response timescale ) .",
    "if pks 1935 - 692 has recently brightened then (  [ ombh2eqn ] ) implies that our @xmath0 estimate is biased upward",
    ". if there is additional foreground continuum absorption then our estimates are biased low .",
    "the results are tabulated below with 1-@xmath4 fitting errors indicated ( monte carlo ) . aside from the uncertainties mentioned above , there is still uncertainty in the temperature through the @xmath50 dependence .",
    "if the gas was pre - ionized to heiii the underdense gas could be colder by a factor of order 2 which would lower the @xmath51 estimates by 20 % .",
    "a larger sample of quasars would make the greatest improvement in the robustness of this measurement ."
