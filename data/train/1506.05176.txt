    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are generally classified as o - rich ( m - type ) or c - rich ( c - type ) based on the chemistry of the photosphere and/or the outer envelope .",
    "when an agb star of intermediate mass range goes through c dredge - up process and thus the c / o ratio is larger than 1 , o - rich dust grain formation ceases and the star may become a carbon star ( e.g. , iben 1981 ; chan & kwok 1990 ) .",
    "s stars are generally regarded as intermediate between m - type and carbon stars in their properties ( lloyd evans & little - marenin 1999 )",
    ". however , this m - s - c evolutionary sequence can be different depending on the mass and metallicity ( e.g. , grnewegen et al .",
    "1995 ; suh 2014 ) .",
    "dust envelopes around agb stars are believed to be a main source of interstellar dust .",
    "the outflowing envelopes around agb stars are very suitable places for massive dust formation .",
    "nearly all agb stars can be identified as long - period variables ( lpvs ) .",
    "the agb phase of the lpv is characterized by dusty stellar winds with high mass - loss rates ( @xmath3 ; e.g. , loup et al . 1993 ) .",
    "as the star leaves the agb phase , its mass - loss rate decreases significantly and the star may become hot enough to ionize its circumstellar material .",
    "when mass - loss reduces the mass of the remaining h - rich envelope below @xmath4 @xmath5 ( the exact value depends on the initial mass ) , the stellar envelope begins to shrink and the effective temperature starts to increase ( e.g. , schnberner 1983 ) until the central star is hot enough ( @xmath4 30000 k ) to ionize the circumstellar nebula . if the temperature increases on a timescale shorter than the dispersion time of the matter previously ejected by the star , a planetary nebula ( pn ) will appear .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are believed to be a common end - point of stellar evolution for a large fraction of all stars between 1 and 10 @xmath6 .",
    "the intermediate phase between the end of the agb phase and the pn phase is called the post - agb phase . during the the post - agb phase , the dust shell formed in the agb phase detaches from the central star and",
    "becomes optically thin after a few hundred years ( e.g. , hrivnak et al .",
    ". there could be some post - agb objects that have left the agb stage but will evolve to the white dwarf stage without ever becoming a pn ( e.g. , zuckerman 1978 ; szczerba et al .",
    "the evolutionary lifetime of a pn is critically dependent on the core - mass of its central star ( e.g. , renzini 1981 ) .",
    "a low - mass star evolves too slowly to become a pn and a high - mass star is luminous too briefly to be detected .",
    "therefore , only stars with core - masses in a narrow mass range ( @xmath4 0.6 @xmath7 ) would be seen as pne ( e.g. , kwok 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 ( @xmath0 ) point source catalog ( psc ) ( version 2.1 ) provided useful photometric data in four bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath11 m ) . in characterizing the circumstellar environments of agb and post - agb stars , the two - color diagram ( 2cd ) in the @xmath0 psc has been useful ( e.g. , suh & kwon 2011 ) .",

    "this requirement of a thin dust shell model may look to be in contradiction to the idea that a star at the end of the agb phase would have a very thick dust shell .",
    "this contradiction could be explained by the effect of the chemical transition from o to c in the agb phase ( see section 6.3 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath0 - 2mass 2cds using [ 12]@xmath13[25 ] versus @xmath22@xmath13[12 ] .",
    "compared with the @xmath0 2cd , the boundaries that separate o - rich , c - rich and s stars are clearer for agb stars .",
    "the locations of observed pne are converged toward upper - middle region . unlike other 2cds ,",
    "the locations of the end points for the post - agb model tracks look to show systematic deviation from the densely populated region of the observed pne .",
    "@xmath22@xmath13[12 ] model colors are generally redder than the observed colors of pne .",
    "post - agb stars and pne typically show h@xmath61 line emission in the @xmath22 band ( e.g. , davis et al .",
    "2003 ; froebrich et al .",
    "the 2mass data in the @xmath22 band ( 2.17 @xmath11 m ) may show this effect . if the effect of h@xmath61 emission on the @xmath22 band is stronger than the one from the pah emission on the [ 12 ] band , the observed @xmath22@xmath13[12 ] colors could be bluer compared with the theoretical model colors which do not consider the h@xmath61 line emission .",
    "another possible reason for the difference could be that the 2mass flux may include only the central star while the @xmath0 fluxes may include the extended post - agb dust envelope ( see section 2 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath1-@xmath0 2cds using [ 9]@xmath13[12 ] versus [ 12]@xmath13[25 ] .",
    "generally , the end points of the o - rich and c - rich post - agb model tracks are converged to the region of observed pne . compared with other 2cds , it is difficult find any boundaries that separate o - rich agb stars and c - rich agb stars .",
    "but the boundary that separates agb stars and pne is clear with the aid of the distinguishing [ 12]@xmath13[25 ] color .",
    "the model [ 9]@xmath13[12 ] colors can be affected by some dust species ( alumina , sic , and pah ) which are not considered in this work .",
    "figure 4 plots @xmath2 2cds using [ 8.28]@xmath13[14.65 ] versus [ 14.65]@xmath13[21.34 ] . unlike other 2cds , the base models ( ol , o , and t ) for high core - mass stars can match the observations better than the models with faster @xmath32 .",
    "generally , this @xmath2 2cd looks to require a faster evolution of the post - agb phase than other 2cds .",
    "the [ 14.65]@xmath13[21.34 ] color is useful to distinguish different classes of objects on the 2cd .",
    "for the [ 8.28]@xmath13[14.65 ] color , the pah emission feature at 8.6 @xmath11 m from post - agb stars and pne could make the observed colors bluer ( downward on the 2cd ) compared with the theoretical models .",
    "to investigate spectral evolution from agb stars to pne , we have performed radiative transfer model calculations for the evolving dust shells and central stars in the post - agb phase .",
    "we have assumed that the central star emits blackbody radiation .",
    "uncertainties remain in a number of aspects .",
    "the spherically symmetric dust shell models used for this work could be too simple for post - agb stars because their shapes are often believed to be non - spherical ( e.g. , bipolar or disk - like objects ) . however , the theoretical models for non - spherical dust envelopes ( disks or toruses ) which are applicable to the highly non - spherical objects should have a much larger number of assumed model parameters which can be difficult to be compared with a large sample of observed objects .",
    "our assumption of the blackbody radiation for the central star inside a dust shell could be too simple especially for post - agb stars for which gas - phase radiation from the outer shell can be important . for the evolution of a post - agb star with an expanding gas shell , volk ( 1992 ) used the output of the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) as input for a dust shell model ( csdust3 ) . but this could have a problem of inconsistent treatment of dust temperatures .",
    "van hoof et al . ( 1997 ) used the cloudy code considering dust emission more consistently for an optically thin dust shell .",
    "however , most dust shell models at the beginning of the post - agb phase require large dust optical depths .    for dust opacity ,",
    "we have not considered some dust species : alumina , sic , and pah .",
    "suh & kwon ( 2011 ) used a mixture of alumina and silicate for o - rich agb stars and a mixture of sic and amc in modelling c - rich agb stars for various model tracks .",
    "we also used the same mixtures for testing post - agb models , which produced different model tracks but the overall match to the observations looked similar . unlike agb stars ,",
    "c - rich post - agb stars or pne typically show pah dust features .",
    "we have discussed possible effects of pah on ir 2cds in section 5 .      even though both our dust shell model and van hoof et al .",
    "( 1997 ) s work assume a spherically symmetric continuous dust shell , van hoof et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used significantly different schemes in their radiative transfer code ( cloudy ) from those used for this work ( radmc-3d ) .",
    "the strong point is that their model can consider some gas - phase radiation ( bound - free emission for hot models ) .",
    "as commented in the paper , the weak point is that the cloudy model for a thick dust shell could be unreliable .",
    "van hoof et al . ( 1997 ) provided many meaningful results , but some of their results need to be considered more carefully because dust optical depths at the beginning of the post - agb phase are generally large .    on the @xmath0 2cd , van hoof et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented the red loop model track which causes the [ 12]-[25 ] color to loop back towards the blue , before the star resumes its normal evolution to the red .",
    "some of our models ( o and t ) also show similar tracks , but they do not cover deep into the li region . sevenster ( 2002 ) tried to explain the li objects on the @xmath0 2cd ( see section 5.1 ) using the leftward model track in the early phases of the red loop track . however , their dust shell model ( cloudy ) could be unreliable because the corresponding dust optical depths ( for the leftward model track ) are very large . volk ( 1992 ) and",
    "ortiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used the output of the photoionization code ( cloudy ) as input for a dust shell model ( csdust3 ) , also did not find the red loop model track .",
    "if our assumptions are right , the li region of the @xmath0 2cd can be covered by the model tracks with thin dust shells at the starts of their post - agb phases and larger detachments which can be achieved by higher expansion velocities ( e.g. , models em2 , ml2 , and cl2 in this work ) .",
    "these models make upward model tracks rather than leftward ( see figure 1 ) . of course",
    ", any spherically symmetric dust shell models would be inappropriate for highly non - spherical objects in the li region .",
    "for the low core - mass model , we also used the model for @xmath47 = 0.605 @xmath7 with the post - agb mass loss rate at the standard value ( see section 4.1 ) . the corresponding dynamical time",
    "scale of the post - agb phase is 2093 years .",
    "this model produced the model results which are too far off from the observed points of post - agb stars and pne on all 2cds .",
    "volk ( 1992 ) and ortiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigated spectral evolution of post - agb stars using the similar scheme for the evolution of the central star .",
    "they also showed that a fast evolution ( the time scale of less than about two thousand years ) was required to match the observations on 2cds . because they assumed an earlier start of the post - agb phase , the dynamical time scales from ortiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are generally larger than those used for this work .",
    "as stars evolve into the thermal pulsing agb phase , the abundances of some elements in the stellar atmosphere may change by the episodic third dredge - up process after each thermal pulse .",
    "when agb stars of intermediate mass range go through carbon dredge - up processes , and thus the abundance of carbon is larger than that of oxygen , o - rich dust grain formation ceases and the stars become visual carbon stars .",
    "after that phase , carbon - rich dust grains start forming and the stars evolve into infrared carbon stars with thick c - rich dust envelopes and very high mass - loss rates ( e.g. , iben 1981 ; chan & kwok 1990 ; suh 2000 ) .",
    "s stars are generally regarded as intermediate between m - type and carbon stars in their properties . however , this m - s - c evolutionary sequence can be different depending on the mass and metallicity ; some stars may remain in s - type until a next thermal pulse but some stars may skip the s - type star phase ( e.g. , grnewegen et al .",
    "sc or cs stars are likely to be in a transitional phase from an s star to a carbon star .",
    "generally , dust formation in envelopes of s stars is less efficient because of the lack of free o or c to form dust .",
    "most s stars show very weak dust ( silicate or carbon ) emission features and low mass - loss rates ( e.g. , hony et al . 2009 ; smolders et al .",
    "2012 ) and their locations are restricted to the regions of thin dust shells ( lower - left regions ) on any ir 2cds ( see figures 1 - 4 ) .    to reproduce the post - agb stars in lower - left and upper - left regions on the @xmath0 2cd",
    ", we need to use very thin dust shell models with higher @xmath32 at the beginning of the post - agb phase ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "s stars or visual carbon stars which have very thin dust shells are believed to be products of the chemical transition from o to c in the agb phase .",
    "the objects which become s stars or visual carbon stars nearly at the end of the agb phase are likely to have very thin dust ( silicate or amc ) shells at the beginning of the post - agb phase",
    ". these objects with with higher @xmath32 could be the post - agb stars or pne in the upper - left region ( vi and li ) on the iras 2cd .",
    "we have presented various ir 2cds for agb stars , post - agb stars , and pne using catalogs from the available literature for the sample of 4903 agb stars ( 3373 o - agb ; 1168 c - agb ; 362 s - type ) , 660 post - agb stars ( 326 post - agb ; 334 pre - pne ) , and 1510 pne in our galaxy . for each object in the catalog , we cross - identify the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and 2mass counterparts . for the large sample of stars , we have presented various ir 2cds using the @xmath0 psc , @xmath1 psc , @xmath2 psc , and nir ( 2mass data at @xmath16 band ) data .    to find possible evolutionary tracks from agb stars to pne on the 2cds , we have made simple but reasonable assumptions on the evolution of the dust shell and the central star in the post - agb phase .",
    "we assume that agb dust formation ( at @xmath33 = 1000 k ) ceases when the post - agb phase starts .",
    "the dust shell detaches with the start of post - agb phase because there is no more dust formation .",
    "we have performed radiative transfer model calculation for detached dust shells around evolving central stars in the post - agb phase .",
    "we have found that the theoretical dust shell model tracks using dust opacity functions of amorphous silicate and amorphous carbon roughly coincide with the densely populated observed points of agb stars , post - agb stars , and pne on various ir 2cds . even though some discrepancies are inevitable , we have found that the end points of the theoretical post - agb model tracks are generally converged to the region of observed points of pne on most 2cds .",
    "the discrepancies could be due to the limitation of the theoretical model used for this work .",
    "the dust shell model did not consider some dust species ( e.g. , pah ) and gas - phase radiation processes .",
    "the spherically symmetric model would not be applicable to a major portion of the observed objects which are highly non - spherical .    in this work ,",
    "comparison of the model results with the observations on the ir 2cds have indicated that the duration of the theoretical post - agb phase needs to be rather short ( within a thousand years ) to match the observations .",
    "this could be because relatively small mass stars are not observed as post - agb stars or pne .",
    "the duration of the post - agb phase for very low - mass stars can be as long as 10@xmath43 - 10@xmath44 years ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "a major portion of these very low - mass stars may evolve to the white dwarf stage without ever becoming a pn .",
    "we have discussed two sequences of the post - agb evolution on the @xmath0 2cd , which are designated as li ( blue group ) and ri ( red group ) .",
    "the red objects are likely to undergo dust shell detachments at the normal agb termination .",
    "most of the observed pne are converged to the ri region as well as the results of all theoretical dust shell models with moderate @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the blue objects in the li region are likely to be non - spherical systems ( precursors of bipolar pne or binary systems ) to which the theoretical dust shell models may not be applicable .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that it is also possible that the blue post - agb stars in the li region as well as in the upper - left region of the @xmath0 2cd have very thin dust shells with higher @xmath32 because they had thin dust shells at the starts of their post - agb phases .",
