    "young supernova remnants ( snrs ) offer the means to study stellar explosions and their interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of these explosions is dissipated in collisionless shocks that heat the ejecta and ism gas to x - ray emitting temperatures . in young snrs , these shocks create an x - ray emitting , ionizing plasma that slowly reaches collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . however , x - ray observations with _ asca _ first revealed possible evidence for `` overionized '' remnants , where the electron temperature @xmath0  derived from the continuum is systematically lower than the temperature @xmath1  given by the line ratios @xcite .",
    "the presence of radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) features , discovered recently with _ suzaku _ observations of various snrs , provided conclusive evidence of overionization@xcite .    in a collisional plasma ( as in snrs ) , this overionized plasma is one signature of rapid electron cooling , and the physical origin of this cooling in snrs remains a topic of debate .",
    "one scenario where cooling can occur is thermal conduction , in which the hot ejecta in the snr interior may cool by exchanging heat efficiently with the exterior material ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , another possible cooling mechanism is adiabatic expansion , where the sn blast wave expands through a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) into a rarefied ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted their _ asca _ results as evidence of cooling via thermal conduction , whereas @xcite demonstrated the timescale for this scenario is too slow to explain the recombining plasma observed with _",
    "observationally , one may distinguish which cooling scenario is responsible by mapping ionization state across snrs .",
    "for example , if overionized plasma is concentrated where it is in contact with colder material , it would suggest cooling via thermal conduction .",
    "conversely , if overionized plasma is less prevalent where ejecta are confined , the plasma likely cooled through adiabatic expansion .",
    "w49b ( g43.3@xmath20.2 ) is one of the first snrs where signatures of a recombining plasma were discovered . using integrated _ asca _ spectra , @xcite measured the intensity ratios of he - like to h - like lines of ar and ca , and they found @xmath3 2.5 kev @xmath4 1.8 kev , where @xmath5 is the ejecta electron temperature .",
    "@xcite performed similar analyses on the global _ xmm - newton _ spectra , and they found no evidence for overionization .",
    "however , they cautioned that the temperature distribution in w49b is not uniform and noted that a spatially - resolved search for overionization may yield different results .",
    "further evidence in favor of recombining plasma in w49b was discovered by @xcite using _ suzaku _ observations : they found an rrc feature from he - like fe at 8.830 kev and derived @xmath3 2.7 kev .",
    "more recently , @xcite attempted to localize spatially the recombining plasma using the archival _ xmm - newton _ data by mapping the hardness ratio of the pn count rate in the 8.312 kev band to that in the 4.46.2 kev band .",
    "they found that the hardness ratio is elevated in the center and west of w49b , which these authors attribute to the fe rrc .",
    "however , the limited counts in the _ xmm - newton _ observations precluded a spatially - resolved spectral modeling of these features , and thus the elevated hardness ratio could be from other sources or processes ( e.g. , high background , harder bremsstrahlung , non - thermal emission ) .",
    "therefore , it is critical to confirm the results of @xcite via another means to constrain the cooling scenario responsible for overionization . additionally , given that the fe as a distinct spatial distribution from the other metals in w49b @xcite , it is worth while to explore whether lighter elements are also overionized in the same locations .",
    "we note that to date , w49b is the only ejecta - dominated snr and possibly the youngest source where these features have been observed .",
    "the age estimate for w49b is uncertain , ranging from @xmath61,000 years @xcite up to @xmath66,000 years @xcite .",
    "other snrs identified to have recombining plasmas are more dynamically mature and have ages @xmath64,00020,000 years ( see @xmath710.3 of the review by @xcite ) . thus , the overionized state of w49b , a dynamically young snr , suggests the physical origin of the recombining plasma can occur in the initial phases of snr evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we identify and map the overionized plasma in w49b in order to constrain the physical origin of the rapid cooling .",
    "for this analysis , we employ the recent 220 ks _",
    "x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation of w49b @xcite . although _ chandra _ is dominated by background above @xmath68 kev and thus is not capable of discerning the fe rrc , we can identify the overionized plasma another way .",
    "in particular , we measure the ejecta electron temperature @xmath5  ( from the bremsstrahlung continuum ) and @xmath1  ( from line flux ratios ) across many regions to assess how the ionization state varies across the snr . in section  [ sec :",
    "data ] , we detail the observations , the procedure we employ to estimate the temperatures , and the results . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications regarding the role of the two cooling mechanisms in the snr evolution and we consider alternate interpretations of the results . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we present a brief summary of this work and outline future observations that could further elucidate the physical origin of rapid cooling in w49b .",
    "w49b was observed for 220 ks with _",
    "chandra _ acis on 1822 august 2011 with the backside - illuminated s3 chip in the timed - exposure faint mode ( obsids 13440 and 13441 ) .",
    "reprocessed data were downloaded from the _ chandra _ archive , and analyses were performed using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 4.3 .",
    "@xcite reported recently a spatially - resolved spectroscopic analysis on these data ; in the central 2.9 a total of @xmath610@xmath8 net counts ( after background subtraction ) were recorded in the 0.58.0 kev band during the observation .",
    "the integrated x - ray spectrum of w49b ( see figure  2 of @xcite ) includes prominent he - like and h - like lines of silicon ( si xiii and si xiv ) , sulfur ( s xv and s xvi ) , argon ( ar xvii and ar xviii ) , and calcium ( ca xix and ) .    for the analyses , we extracted spectra from 13 regions of area 59@xmath9 @xmath10 59@xmath9 , as shown in figure  [ fig : kt_e ] .",
    "these regions each have @xmath1125000 net full - band counts , with @xmath115000 and @xmath112500 net counts in the s and ar bands respectively , sufficient to fit these features successfully .",
    "we found that smaller regions did not give us enough counts to distinguish the ar xviii line ( the weakest line we include in our analysis ) above the continuum .",
    "we modeled spectra using xspec version 12.7.0 @xcite , and we adopt the solar abundance values of @xcite .",
    "the choice of solar abundance values affects the best - fit absorbing column @xmath12 , since x - rays are attenuated by ism metals ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "first , to determine @xmath12 toward each region , we modeled the spectra as two absorbed cie plasmas using the xspec components _ phabs _ and _ vapec _",
    "@xcite : one cooler , ism component with solar abundances and one hotter , ejecta component with super - solar abundances of 310@xmath10 the solar values of si , s , ar , ca , and fe by number @xcite .",
    "we have selected this two - component model as previous x - ray studies of w49b have demonstrated that a solar abundance ism plasma plus a ejecta plasma with super - solar abundances are necessary to adequately fit the spectrum @xcite . in our fits ,",
    "@xmath12 , the cool and the hot component temperatures ( @xmath14 and @xmath5 , respectively ) , and the abundances of elements with prominent emission lines ( si , s , ar , ca , and fe ) were allowed to vary freely .",
    "we found best - fit @xmath12 of the 13 regions ranging 7.08.9@xmath15 @xmath16 , consistent with the values derived in @xcite .",
    "previous x - ray studies of w49b with _",
    "asca _ and _ chandra _ @xcite demonstrated that the si xiii emission may arise from the cool ism component , while the other lines are predominantly from the ejecta component . as we want to measure the overionization of the ejecta , we should consider lines that originate from the hotter plasma .",
    "based on the cie spectral fits of the 13 regions performed above , we find that the fraction of the flux from the hot ejecta component in the si xiii , s xv , and ar xvii lines is 55% , 93% , and 99% , respectively .",
    "therefore , in our estimates of the ionization temperature @xmath1 below , we consider the he - like and h - like lines of s and ar .",
    "we did not include ca as we determined that for the plasma temperatures of w49b , the systematic errors in the estimate of @xmath1  from the flux ratio of ca xix to ca xx were too large ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we have divided the snr into several regions and used the procedure outlined below to estimate @xmath5 and @xmath1 at each location .",
    "we remodeled the spectra of each region phenomenologically , using two absorbed continuum components ( one for the cool , ism plasma and one for the hot , super - solar plasma ) plus gaussian functions to account for the line emission . to characterize the continuum of the two plasmas",
    ", we employed the atomdb noline model , which removes the line emission from an _ apec _ plasma .",
    "the noline model includes three processes in modeling the continuum : bremsstrahlung , rrcs , and two photon emission from low - lying h- and he - like levels .",
    "furthermore , we added gaussian functions for fifteen emission lines with the following initial guesses for centroid energy : mg xi ( @xmath171.45 kev ) , si xiii ( @xmath171.85 kev ) , si xiv ( @xmath172.00 kev ) , si k@xmath18 ( @xmath172.19 kev ) , s xv ( @xmath172.45 kev ) , s xvi ( @xmath172.60 kev ) , s k@xmath18 ( @xmath172.88 kev ) , ar xvii ( @xmath173.11 kev ) , ar xviii ( @xmath173.31 kev ) , ar k@xmath18 ( @xmath173.69 kev ) , ca xix ( @xmath173.89 kev ) , ca xx ( @xmath174.13 kev ) , ca k@xmath18 ( @xmath174.58 kev ) , fe xxv ( @xmath176.64 kev ) , and fe k@xmath18 ( @xmath176.97 kev ) . to reduce the number of free parameters",
    ", we froze the @xmath12 to the values derived from the two cie plasma fits described above .",
    "we performed an initial fit by freezing the line centroid energies while letting the two plasma electron temperatures ( @xmath5 and @xmath14 ) , plasma normalizations , and line fluxes vary .",
    "subsequently , we thawed the line centroid energies and refit the spectra .",
    "using this procedure , we obtained the two plasma electron temperatures ( the hot ejecta temperature , @xmath5 , and the cool ism temperature , @xmath14 ) and the line fluxes for the 13 regions , listed in table  [ table : lines ] .",
    "we found best - fit temperatures of the cool component ranging from @xmath190.01 kev to @xmath200.01 kev across the snr .",
    "the best - fit ejecta temperatures also vary ( see the map of @xmath5 in the right panel of figure  [ fig : kt_e ] ) , with @xmath211.13@xmath130.01 kev up to @xmath211.84@xmath130.07 kev , with 90% confidence errors .",
    "our results suggest there is a temperature gradient , with rising @xmath14 and @xmath5  toward the east of the snr .",
    "the expansion is thought to be impeded in the east by dense molecular material there @xcite .",
    "the values we derive for @xmath14 and @xmath5  in many regions of w49b are slightly lower than that estimated by @xcite , who found @xmath22 kev and @xmath0= 1.70@xmath23 kev , from the integrated _ asca _ spectrum .",
    "we note that these authors assumed the continuum purely consisted of bremsstrahlung emission , whereas the noline model we have employed accounts for rrcs and two photon emission as well .",
    "the inclusion of these processes reduces the measured @xmath5  and also affects the derived @xmath1  from the line fluxes .",
    "furthermore , our estimates of @xmath5  are lower than those estimated for the hot plasma component by @xcite and @xcite , who find @xmath5= 1.773.0 kev and @xmath5= 1.803.68 kev , respectively .",
    "the reason is that the cie fits performed by these authors use both the line ratios and the bremsstrahlung continuum to estimate @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the fact that the derived @xmath5  in this previous work is greater than when @xmath5  is modeled from bremsstrahlung alone proves the overionized state of the plasma .",
    "we measured @xmath1  for the 13 regions based on the line flux ratios of the he - like and h - like lines of s and ar , since these features are easily discernible at the moderate spectral resolution of acis . in table",
    "[ table : lines ] , we list the fluxes ( corrected for absorption ) obtained from the gaussian fits ; from these , we derived @xmath1  using current atomic data for a cie plasma @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : overionization ] ( left panel ) , we plot the model predictions for @xmath1  as a function of line flux ratio for s and ar , and we superimpose our measured ratios on the respective curves . for s ,",
    "we find he - like to h - like ratios of 1.64.4 , corresponding to @xmath1@xmath17 1.31.7 kev .",
    "we derive ratios of 2.69.2 for ar ; these values give @xmath1@xmath17 1.52.1 kev . to estimate the uncertainty in the line ratios , we refit the spectra while freezing the @xmath5 to the upper and lower limits , and calculated the line ratios in these cases . in all 13 regions , the derived line ratios changed by @xmath61% .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that any uncertainties are dominated by systematic errors , as discussed below .",
    "to identify regions of overionization , we map the ratio @xmath1/@xmath5  across the 13 regions in figure  [ fig : overionization ] .",
    "regions with @xmath1/@xmath5  @xmath24 are overionized , while ratios of order unity indicate ionization consistent with a cie plasma .",
    "the degree of ionization appears to vary from east to west , with more ionized plasma toward the west of the snr .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] gives an example spectrum of an overionized region and a synthetic spectrum for comparison of how the data would appear if the plasma was in cie .",
    "these two spectra have remarkable differences , including a much greater s xv flux and much lower ar xviii flux in the cie plasma spectrum than observed in the overionized spectrum .",
    "our localization of the overionized plasma toward the west of w49b is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who contended the central and western regions of w49b are overionized based on larger hardness ratio there ( which they attribute to the presence of fe rrcs ) .",
    "( black points ) .",
    "the black line shows the best fit to this spectrum , with @xmath25 kev , @xmath26 kev , and gaussian components for the sulfur ( with @xmath27 kev ) and argon ( @xmath28 kev ) .",
    "the blue line reflects the two noline continuum components of this fit . for comparison , we plot synthetic spectra ( red points ) and model of how the data would appear if the region two - temperature cie plasmas ( with @xmath29 kev and @xmath301.2 kev ) .",
    "in the cie plasma spectrum , the flux in s xv is substantially greater , and ar xviii is not discernible from the continuum emission . ]    to assess our ability to measure @xmath5  and @xmath1 , we performed the same analyses on synthetic acis spectra of two - temperature cie plasmas .",
    "in particular , we produced 28 spectra over a grid of temperatures : @xmath31 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 1.00 kev and @xmath32 1.00 , 1.25 , 1.50 , 1.75 , 2.00 , 2.25 , and 2.50 kev ( i.e. , we considered every combination of these two temperatures ) .",
    "to produce these 28 synthetic spectra , we assumed @xmath33 @xmath16 , solar abundances for the cool component , and 5@xmath10 solar abundances for the hot component ( values consistent with the integrated properties of w49b : @xcite ) .",
    "we analyzed the 28 synthetic spectra using the same procedure as outlined above : we modeled the spectra as absorbed , two noline apec components plus gaussian functions for the emission lines .",
    "then , we measured the s , ar , and ca line ratios and derived @xmath5  and @xmath1  in each spectrum , we compared the input temperatures of the synthetic spectra to our derived temperatures , and we use the deviations from cie ( where @xmath5  should equal @xmath1 ) to evaluate the systematic errors in our measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "we found that for the temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath5 of w49b , @xmath1  derived from the sulfur lines was within @xmath65% of @xmath5 . for argon at w49b temperatures",
    ", we obtained @xmath1  that were systematically above @xmath5  by 1020% , with less accuracy with lower @xmath5 .",
    "we also performed the same synthetic analyses on the he - like to h - like line flux ratios of calcium to assess whether to include these lines in our study of w49b .",
    "we found that @xmath1  derived from calcium was more than 0.5 kev greater than @xmath5 , at the temperatures of w49b .",
    "we note that at hotter ejecta temperatures of @xmath5= 2.5 kev , @xmath1  is reliable and within 5% of @xmath5 .",
    "however , given that @xmath5  of the 13 regions of w49b are @xmath612 kev , we opted to exclude calcium from our analyses .",
    "the systematic errors partly explain why we find a larger degree of overionization in argon than in sulfur . from our synthetic spectral analyses",
    ", we anticipate that @xmath1  obtained from argon is @xmath6 0.2 kev above the true @xmath1 , yet our w49b results showed @xmath1  from argon is @xmath6 0.20.5 kev above that of sulfur .",
    "the origin of this difference is unlikely to be physical given that the recombination timescales of sulfur are longer than argon @xcite .",
    "although these elements yielded different magnitudes of overionization , both show the same trend of increasing ionization to the west , and the changes in ionization state we find across w49b are larger than the systematic errors .",
    "broadly , our results indicate that the accuracy in measuring @xmath1  using particular line ratios is dependent on the plasma s electron temperature , and thus , one should consider @xmath5  when selecting which line ratios to employ to assess overionization of the plasma .",
    "we note that we have considered the case of w49b , where the cool plasma has ism ( solar ) abundances .",
    "if one has two temperature plasmas and each component has super - solar abundances , the emission lines which give the most accurate measure of @xmath5  may be different than our findings above .",
    "as noted above , two scenarios may lead to the rapid cooling associated with overionization : adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , @xcite ) or thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the maps of ionization state across w49b in figure  [ fig : overionization ] can aid in distinguishing which of these mechanisms may dominate .",
    "in particular , if the cooling originates from adiabatic expansion , overionization should be most prevalent where the blast wave is expanding through a rarefied ism .",
    "conversely , if the plasma cools via thermal conduction , the overionized hot gas should be concentrated where it is in contact with cold , dense material .",
    "we find a gradient of increasing overionization toward the west of w49b , while the east is at or near cie .",
    "given the location of molecular material and the plasma temperatures across w49b , the distribution of the overionized plasma is most consistent with the adiabatic cooling scenario .",
    "in particular , the ejecta are impacting nearby molecular material ( see the blue contours in figure  [ fig : kt_e ] , left ) in the east , and the plasma is the hottest there ( with : figure  [ fig : kt_e ] , right ) . in the west , the ejecta are expanding relatively unimpeded ( particularly in the northwest ) , and the plasma is the coolest there ( with ) .",
    "although molecular material is seen in the southwest , this gas may be seen in projection : low - frequency radio observations have shown intervening absorbing material there @xcite and the @xmath12 is enhanced in that area of the snr ( with @xmath34 @xmath16 : @xcite ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the recent hydrodynamical simulations performed by @xcite , who showed that the spatial distribution of overionized ejecta can be attributed to the rapid free expansion of the plasma following heating by an inhomogeneous medium ( although their models focus principally on the central region of the snr ) .",
    "we are unable to confirm the expansion rates of the two sides of w49b using proper motion : the 11-year baseline between _ chandra _ observations is not long enough to observe expansion with the spatial resolution of acis . at the off - axis position of the snr rim , the acis point - spread function is @xmath64 pixels .",
    "thus , a velocity of @xmath116800 km s@xmath35 would be necessary to detect the expansion , assuming a distance @xmath36 8 kpc to w49b @xcite",
    ".    however , the surface brightness profiles across the snr boundaries are consistent with impeded expansion in the east and faster expansion in the west ( see figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) . for this analysis",
    ", we computed the net full - band surface brightness @xmath37 ( in counts arcsec@xmath38 ) across nineteen profiles , each composed of 68 narrow rectangles with area 2@xmath1040 pixel@xmath39 ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] , left ) .",
    "we oriented the rectangles such that they were parallel to the x - ray full - band contours , and we averaged the profiles of the east and the west ( after translating the maxima of the profiles so they were aligned ) . figure  [ fig : profiles ] ( right ) gives the resulting mean @xmath37 value as a function of position across the east and west edge of w49b .",
    "the eastern profile has a steep slope , with a factor of @xmath610 increase in @xmath37 over @xmath615 .",
    "by contrast , the change in @xmath37 in the west is much more gradual , with a factor of @xmath63 increase in @xmath37 over @xmath635 .",
    "the sharp boundary in the east is consistent with the ejecta being inhibited by the molecular material there , whereas the emission in the west is more diffuse .",
    "we have presented maps of the overionized plasma in w49b using data from the recent 220 ks _",

    ", we found that the snr plasma is overionized in the west and has a gradient of increasing ionization from east to west .",
    "based on the impeded expansion of the ejecta in the east and relatively lower inferred density ism in the west , we suggest that the overionization maps are consistent with adiabatic expansion being the dominant cooling mechanism . in the future , these results can be confirmed by performing spatially - resolved spectroscopic analysis of the fe rrc in a deeper _ xmm - newton _ observation of w49b and by measuring directly the expansion velocities of the snr through proper motion or spectroscopy studies .",
