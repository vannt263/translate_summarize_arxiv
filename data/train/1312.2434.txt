    "@xcite to relativistic regimes the classic work of feynman , metropolis and teller ( fmt ) @xcite , solving a compressed atom by the thomas - fermi equation in a wigner - seitz cell .",
    "the integration of this equation does not admit any regular solution for a point - like nucleus and both the nuclear radius and the nuclear composition have necessarily to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "this introduces a fundamental difference from the non - relativistic thomas - fermi model where a point - like nucleus is adopted .",
    "so , this approach improves in the following aspects all previous treatments of the equation of state ( eos ) of a compressed atom , including the classic works based on the uniform approximation by chandrasekhar @xcite and the eos by salpeter @xcite : 1 ) in order to guarantee self - consistency with a relativistic treatment of the electrons , the point - like assumption of the nucleus is abandoned introducing a finite sized nucleus ; 2 ) the coulomb interaction energy is fully calculated without any approximation by solving numerically the relativistic thomas - fermi equation for each given nuclear composition ; 3 ) the inhomogeneity of the electron distribution inside each wigner - seitz cell , 4 ) the energy - density of the system is calculated taking into account the contributions of the nuclei , of the coulomb interactions , as well as of the relativistic electrons to the energy of the wigner - seitz cells ; 5 ) the @xmath6-equilibrium between neutrons , protons and electrons is also taken into account leading to a self - consistent calculation of the threshold density for triggering the inverse @xmath6-decay of a given nucleus .",
    "the computation of the eos is done by calculating the dependence of all these ingredients on the level of compression inside the star interior .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how all these effects together with general relativity are important in the determination of the macroscopic structure of white dwarfs as well as for the determination of their maximum stable mass against gravitational collapse .",
    "more recently , the relativistic fmt eos has been used to determine general relativistic equilibrium configurations of rotating white dwarfs @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssdswd ] we show the mass - radius relation of @xmath7 white dwarfs for the relativistic fmt , salpeter , and chandrasekhar eos and compare them with the estimated masses and radii of white dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss - e06 catalog ) @xcite .",
    "it can be clearly seen that already for masses @xmath8@xmath9 deviations from the degenerate treatments are evident .",
    "it is natural to expect that such deviations could be related to the neglected effects of finite temperatures on the structure of the white dwarf .",
    "thus , besides being interesting by their own , the finite temperature effects on the eos and consequently on the mass - radius relation of the white dwarf are very important . in this work",
    "we extend our previous eos @xcite , based on the degenerate relativistic fmt treatment , by introducing the effects of finite temperatures and use it to construct equilibrium configurations of white dwarfs at finite temperatures .",
    "it is very interesting that there have been recently discovered ultra - low mass white dwarfs with masses @xmath10 , which are companions of neutron stars in relativistic binaries ; see e.g.  refs .",
    "these low - mass white dwarfs represent the perfect arena to testing the eos of compressed matter since the central densities of these objects are expected to be @xmath11 g @xmath12 , where the degenerate approximation breaks down and so temperature effects can not be neglected . using the mass - radius relation at finite temperatures , we analyze in the present work the structure of the white dwarf orbiting the pulsar psr j1738 + 0333 .",
    "we infer its mass , radius , surface gravity , internal temperature , and compare and contrast them with previous estimates .",
    "the generalization of the relativistic fmt model presented in this work will be also useful to extend previous works in which the non - relativistic thomas - fermi model has been used to describe the physics of the low density layers of neutron stars including their atmospheres ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the proper treatment of the relativistic and coulomb effects corrects the over and underestimate of the total pressure at high and low densities respectively , which occurs in non - relativistic thomas - fermi models and in the approximate coulomb corrections of salpeter @xcite ; see @xcite , for further details .",
    "in addition to the generalization of the eos of compressed matter , we follow the steps in @xcite and extrapolate the treatment to the case of compressed nuclear matter cores of stellar dimensions introduced in : macroscopic cores composed of neutrons , protons , and electron in @xmath6-equilibrium and with mass numbers @xmath13 , hence masses @xmath14 ; expected to be bound by self - gravity .",

    "for the present finite temperature case , from our numerical integration we found that the critical densities for the occurrence of the inverse @xmath6-decay instability are not affected so that they are the same as in the degenerate approximation .",

    "@xcite , we recently computed in @xcite the critical density for pycnonuclear instability in general relativistic uniformly rotating @xmath72c white dwarfs , at zero temperatures .",
    "it comes out that the instability agent of white dwarfs can be either general relativistic effects or inverse @xmath6-decay or pycnonuclear reactions or rotation through mass - shedding or secular instabilities ( see @xcite , for details ) .",
    "the electrons around the nuclei screen the positive charge of the nucleus reducing the coulomb barrier ; hence their proper inclusion could in principle increase the reaction rates .",
    "on the other hand , we showed in figs .",
    "[ fig : nefe ] and [ fig : rhone ] two different effects owing to the finite temperature : 1 ) it tends to flatten the electron distribution , thus changing the electron screening of the coulomb potential with respect to the degenerate case ; and 2 ) it increases the electron density hence the pressure at the border of the cell .",
    "these effects clearly could lead not only to qualitative but also to quantitative differences in the estimate of the rates of the pycnonuclear reactions ( see e.g.  ) .",
    "however , the inclusion of these combined effects within the pycnonuclear reactions treatment , following a fully relativistic approach of the electron gas and the coulomb interactions as the one presented here , is a most difficult and complex task that deserves a detailed and separated analysis , and therefore will not be addressed here .",
