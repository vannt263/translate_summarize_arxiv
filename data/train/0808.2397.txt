    "understanding the transition from the perturbative to the nonperturbative regimes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) remains one of the most challenging problems in nuclear and hadron physics .",
    "recent progress in describing this transition has focused on quark - hadron duality , which relates observables computed from quark and gluon degrees of freedom to those parametrized in terms of hadronic variables .",
    "a classic example of this is the phenomenon of bloom - gilman duality @xcite , in which the inclusive structure functions in the region dominated by low - lying nucleon resonances follow deep inelastic structure functions describing high energy data , to which the resonance structure functions average @xcite .    in qcd the observation of this duality can be formulated within the operator product expansion ( ope ) , in which moments of structure functions are expanded in inverse powers of @xmath3 , the four - momentum squared of the exchanged photon .",
    "the leading term is given by matrix elements of twist - two local operators , and is associated with single parton scattering , while the @xmath4 and higher terms are related to higher twist nonperturbative multi - parton correlations .",
    "( the twist of a local operator in the ope is defined as its mass dimension minus its spin . )",
    "the magnitude of the higher twist contributions then determines the degree to which duality holds @xcite .    in order to reliably extract information on the duality - violating higher twist contributions to structure functions ,",
    "it is vital to remove from the data kinematical corrections associated with nonzero values of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy transfer , @xmath7 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath8 is the bjorken scaling variable .",
    "while formally related to twist - two operators @xcite , these `` target mass corrections '' ( tmcs ) are suppressed by powers of @xmath9 , hence tmcs are sometimes inaccurately referred to as `` kinematical higher twists '' , and can obscure information on genuine higher twist terms .",
    "the importance of tmcs has been highlighted recently by high - precision data from jefferson lab on both spin - averaged and spin - dependent structure functions @xcite taken at moderate @xmath3 values , @xmath10  gev@xmath11 , and at large @xmath2 , where tmcs are most significant .",
    "furthermore , with high - intensity neutrino - nucleus scattering experiments planned in similar kinematics @xcite , tmcs for weak interactions also need to be understood .",
    "target mass corrections for spin - averaged nucleon structure functions were first considered by georgi & politzer within the ope @xcite , and later extended to the full set of electroweak structure functions @xcite . for spin - dependent scattering ,",
    "these were evaluated within the same ope formalism in refs .",
    "@xcite , extended to the full set by blmlein & tkabladze @xcite , and computed by detmold @xcite for the deuteron .",
    "one of the limitations of the ope formulation of tmcs is the so - called `` threshold problem '' , in which the target mass corrected structure functions remain nonzero at @xmath12 .",
    "this arises from the failure to consistently incorporate the elastic threshold in moments of structure functions at finite @xmath3 , resulting in nonuniformity of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 limits , where @xmath15 is the rank of the moment . after performing an inverse mellin",
    "transform on the moments , the extracted structure functions consequently acquire incorrect support at large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to redress the threshold problem by considering various prescriptions to tame the unphysical behavior as @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these approaches are not unique , however , and sometimes introduce additional complications ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    an alternative approach , which avoids the threshold ambiguities from the outset , involves formulating tmcs directly in momentum space @xcite using the collinear factorization ( cf ) formalism @xcite .",
    "this method was heuristically applied by aivazis , olness & tung @xcite and by kretzer & reno @xcite to spin - averaged structure functions .",
    "more recently accardi & qiu @xcite applied this formalism to deep inelastic structure functions at large @xmath2 , carefully taking into account the elastic threshold and thereby solving the threshold problem .",
    "however , in the handbag approximation , without introducing a suitable jet function accounting for the invariant mass of the final hadronic state @xcite , leading order structure functions can still be nonzero at @xmath17 .",
    "in this letter we use the cf framework to derive target mass corrections to the leading twist @xmath0 and @xmath18 structure functions and the @xmath1 polarization asymmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cf ] we outline the main steps in the derivation ; a more detailed account will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numest ] we compare and contrast the predictions for the tmcs in cf with those using the standard ope formulation .",
    "we find that the tmcs using the cf method are generally larger for the @xmath0 structure function than in the ope .",
    "however , since the tmcs are qualitatively similar for @xmath0 and @xmath19 , the effects largely cancel in the @xmath1 asymmetry , although the residual effects can still be up to 20% at large @xmath2 , and for @xmath1 even differ in sign for the cf and ope approaches . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings and preview future work .",
    "the computation of tmcs in collinear factorization makes use of the factorization theorem relating the hadronic tensor @xmath20 for @xmath21 scattering to the partonic tensor @xmath22 for the scattering of a virtual photon from a parton of flavor @xmath23 .",
