    "the definition of nonclassicality of a quantum state of the harmonic oscillator is closely connected to the coherent states .",
    "these are the eigenstates of the annihilation operator , @xmath1 , where the complex number @xmath2 defines the amplitude and phase of the field @xcite .",
    "glauber and sudarshan showed that the density operator of an arbitrary optical quantum state can be formally written as a statistical mixture of coherent states , @xmath3 where the glauber - sudarshan representation @xmath4 plays the role of the probability distribution of coherent states @xcite .",
    "however , in quantum optics @xmath4 often violates the properties of a probability density .",
    "hence , a state is referred to as nonclassical if its @xmath0 function does not exhibit the properties of a classical probability density @xcite .",
    "only recently , nonclassicality of experimentally generated states has been demonstrated by means of this definition @xcite . in many cases , however , the @xmath0 functions of nonclassical states are highly singular , such that they can not be reconstructed from the measured experimental data .",
    "this is the case for squeezed states , having a quadrature variance of less than the quadrature variance of the vacuum state .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 function of a squeezed vacuum state with quadrature variances @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( we assume that @xmath7 , where unity represents the normalized vacuum noise ) may be formally written as @xmath8 this quantity can not be understood as a well - behaved function .",
    "phase - diffused squeezed states define an interesting class of states with a , in general , not accessible @xmath0 function . in very recent experiments",
    "these states were used to demonstrate _ purification _ and _ distillation _ for continuous variable quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "phase diffused squeezed states are a mixture of squeezed ( vacuum ) states with a stochastically distributed phase .",
    "they are related to a realistic decoherence process and may be produced from pure squeezed states in a phase noisy transmission channel .",
    "they reveal a non - gaussian noise distribution , have a positive wigner function , and , for strong phase noise , may show no squeezing effect at the level of second moments of the quadrature operators .    in this paper",
    ", we use phase - diffused squeezed states in order to experimentally test nonclassicality criteria for the case where the @xmath0 function can not directly be reconstructed from the homodyne detector quadrature data .",
    "first , we concentrate on the _ characteristic function _ of the @xmath0 function , which is always well - behaved , and investigate the criterion proposed in @xcite .",
    "second , we examine _ moments _ of the quadrature operator and search for higher - order squeezing @xcite .",
    "third , we check a hierarchy of criteria based on _ normally ordered moments _ , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we find that the characteristic function of the @xmath0 function outperforms the other criteria of nonclassicality .",
    "let us consider a statistical mixture of squeezed states , each described by a wigner function @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the quadrature variables , rotated around an angle @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the variances of both quadratures @xmath14 , satisfying the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the statistical distribution of the phase fluctuations , then the wigner function of the mixed state reads @xmath17 in our examination of nonclassicality , the characteristic function @xmath18 of the @xmath0 function plays a decisive role .",
    "it is connected to the wigner function via fourier transform @xmath19 for a squeezed state , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigner : squeezed ] ) , we find @xmath20}.\\label{eq : charfunc : squeezed}\\ ] ] the characteristic function for the mixed state is given in close analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixed : state : wigner ] ) , @xmath21    .parameter of the examined states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the experimental results are shown in table [ tab : minimum : eigenvalues ] .",
    "we only consider matrices of even dimension , since we noted that the minimum eigenvalues of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equal .",
    "this may be due to the fact that odd moments of squeezed vacuum states vanish , giving the matrices a special structure .",
    "we observe that all matrices , which belong to the states showing squeezing , have significantly negative eigenvalues .",
    "hence , their nonclassical character can be directly observed in the sign of the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , for the states with @xmath24 the matrix @xmath25 is positive semidefinite , since this directly corresponds to the absence of quadrature squeezing .",
    "for the state with @xmath26 the matrices @xmath27 with @xmath28 possess a negative eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , agarwal s criterion extends the range of detection of nonclassicality . only for the completely phase - diffused state ,",
    "are we not able to prove nonclassicality by this method . for this state",
    ", the effect might appear in higher - dimensional matrices , but the statistical uncertainty might hide the effect .",
    "we have used experimental data sets of quadrature measurements on phase - diffused squeezed states for a test of different nonclassicality criteria . even for a _ completely _ phase - diffused squeezed state , i.e.  where the measured statistics were identical for all homodyne detection phase angles , we found a pronounced nonclassical character .",
    "this could be illustrated with the help of the characteristic function of the @xmath0 function : it directly shows nonclassical features in the lowest - order criterion of @xcite and the nonclassicality was detected with a rather high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "other nonclassicality criteria , such as higher - order squeezing or the violation of positive semidefiniteness of agarwal s matrices , fail to reveal nonclassicality beyond squeezing or only show nonclassical behavior in matrices of higher dimension .",
    "therefore , we demonstrated for the radiation under study , that the characteristic function of the @xmath0 function , which contains information about all moments of the state , can be a more powerful tool for the examination of nonclassicality than a finite set of moments .    eventually , we note that the evaluation of the statistical significance of nonclassical effects is much easier in terms of characteristic functions , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : sample : cf : standard : deviation ] ) provides a simple relation between the variance and the value of @xmath18 .",
    "testing the definiteness of matrices of moments requires complex nonlinear procedures , for instance the calculation of the smallest eigenvalue or the principal minors .",
    "this leads to complications in the estimation of the statistical significance , which increase the computational effort . for matrices of high orders",
    "the resulting errors are large and they may hide the sought nonclassical effects .",
    "we thank j.  fiurek for many helpful discussions .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath18 can be given in terms of normally ordered moments of the creation and annihilation operator @xcite : @xmath29 introducing the phase - dependent quadrature operator @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 consequently , the normally ordered moments @xmath32 can be calculated from the characteristic function of the @xmath0 function as @xmath33 to obtain a formula which can be applied in practice , we insert eq .",
    "( [ eq : charfunc : p ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : calc : moments : from : phi ] ) and use the definition of the hermite polynomials in the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 . neglecting the phase argument , we find @xmath36 ^ 2 } e^{\\hat x^2/2}\\right>\\bigg|_{\\xi = 0}\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\left<\\frac{(-1)^k}{2^{k/2}}h_k\\left(\\xi - \\tfrac{\\hat x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)e^{-\\left[\\xi - \\tfrac{\\hat x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right]^2 } e^{\\tfrac{\\hat x^2}{2}}\\right>\\bigg|_{\\xi = 0}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{2^{k/2}}\\left < h_k\\left(\\tfrac{\\hat x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we obtain normally ordered moments from measured quadratures via @xmath37 the approximation sign indicates that the right hand side is a statistical estimator .",
