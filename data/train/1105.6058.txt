    "quantum state transfer between distant qubits ( say , a and b ) is a fundamental tool for processing quantum information .",
    "the task of covering relatively large distances between the elements of a quantum computer , much larger than the qubit interaction range , can be achieved by means of a suitable communication channel connecting the qubits a and b.    spin chains are among the most studied channel prototypes  @xcite . in particular , the @xmath4 @xmath5 model has been widely employed as a tool for testing and analyzing quantum communication protocols .",
    "for such a communication channel to be experimentally feasible one could be lead to consider systems with uniform intrachannel interactions  @xcite and whose operation does not require peculiar initialization procedures , although other proposals have been recently put forward  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum - transfer capabilities of homogeneous spin channels have not yet been fully explored under many respects .",
    "for instance , it is a common belief that the longer the chain the worse is the transmission fidelity  @xcite as an effect of dispersion , and chains up to only a few tenths of spins are often considered .",
    "the present work is devoted to the study of the ballistic regime , where the transmission can be depicted  @xcite in terms of a traveling wavepacket carrying the information about the state of the endpoint qubit a , eventually yielding the state reconstruction at the opposite endpoint qubit b thanks to the overall system s mirror symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the ballistic regime differs from that arising in the limit of very weak endpoint couplings  @xcite where ( almost ) perfect state transfer occurs at very long times as a result of a rabi - like population transfer involving only the lowest - energy single - particle modes .",
    "understanding the basic mechanism of ballistic transfer , where the number of involved single - particle modes will be shown to be of the order of @xmath6 , allows us to devise an optimal value of the endpoint interactions for any @xmath2 , and vice versa .",
    "remarkably , the corresponding transmission quality , as witnessed by the state- and the entanglement fidelity , does not decrease to zero when the channel becomes very long , but remains surprisingly high .",
    "we consider the setup illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.qwire ] : the channel connecting the qubits a and b is a one - dimensional array of @xmath2 localized @xmath7 spins with exchange interactions of @xmath8 heisenberg type and a possible external magnetic field applied along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "this gives the total hamiltonian the following structure @xmath10 where the qubits a and b sit at the endpoint sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 of a one - dimensional discrete lattice on whose sites @xmath13 the spin chain is set .",
    "the exchange interaction ( chosen as energy unit ) and the magnetic field @xmath14 are homogeneous along the chain , and an overall mirror symmetry is assumed , implying the endpoint coupling @xmath0 and field @xmath15 to be the same for both ends .",
    "the @xmath2 spins constituting the @xmath8 channel are collectively indicated by @xmath16 .",
    "we will focus our attention on how the state of the qubit b evolves under the influence of the chain @xmath16 , and depending on the initial state of the qubit a ; the latter is possibly entangled with an ancillary qubit c. the results of the analysis are used for gathering insights on the quantum - information transmission through the chain , so as to characterize the dynamical evolution of the overall system and to maximize the quality of the quantum - state transfer .",

    "the formalism used to study the dynamical evolution of the composite system is introduced and we derive the corresponding time - dependent expressions for the quantities used for estimating the quality of the quantum - state and entanglement transfer processes . in section  [ s.xxmodel ] the proposed formalism is applied to the @xmath8 model described by eq .  .",
    "in section  [ s.optimal ] we put forward an analytical framework in order to improve the understanding of the conditions inducing an optimal ballistic dynamics .",
    "the resulting high - quality transfer processes along the spin chain are analyzed in section  [ s.exploit ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ s.conclusions ] , where comments about possible implementation of the procedure are also put forward .",
    "relevant details of calculations are reported in the appendices .",
    "the density matrix of a qubit b can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are complex numbers , and @xmath20 is an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space of @xmath21 matrices endowed with the hilbert - schmidt trace - product , @xmath22\\,{=}\\,\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] . in some cases",

    "notice that @xmath48 has a fully separable structure : this is not a necessary condition for the explicit determination of the dynamical matrix ( a structure such as @xmath56 would also work ) , but it is quite meaningful in our scheme , as the qubit b is assumed not to interact with the chain during the initialization process , which makes quite artificial its being entangled with the chain before the dynamics starts .",

    "in this paper we have shown that high - quality quantum state and entanglement transfer between two qubits a and b is obtained through a uniform @xmath8 channel of arbitrary length @xmath2 by a proper choice of the interaction @xmath0 between the channel and the qubits .",
    "the value of such interaction is found to control the transfer regime of the channel , which varies , as @xmath0 increases , from the rabi - like one , characterized by very long transmission time , to an intermediate regime , which turns useless for the purpose of quantum communication , and finally becomes ballistic for @xmath0 of the order of the intrachannel interaction .    in order to get coherent transfer in the ballistic regime ,",
    "it is desirable that the @xmath177-density of the traveling wavepacket generated by alice s initialized qubit a be narrow and concentrated in the linear zone of the dispersion relation , i.e. , with equispaced frequencies . as the parameter @xmath0 controls both the width of the @xmath177-density and the spacings of the frequencies entering the dynamics , one can therefore improve the transmission quality up to a best trade - off arising for an optimal value @xmath276 which for large @xmath2 behaves as @xmath277 .",
    "remarkably , we have found that for such a choice the quantum - state - transfer quality indicators are very high and , indeed , have a lower bound for @xmath254 that still allows to efficiently perform quantum - information tasks : e.g. , the average fidelity of state transmission is larger than 90% .",
    "the ballistic regime ensures fast transmission on a time scale of the order of @xmath2 , at variance with the rabi - like regime , and in the optimal case the reading time increases as @xmath278 .",
    "it is also to be noted that , if experimental settings constrain to a given value @xmath279 , yet one can optimize the chain length in such a way that @xmath280 . the only requirement on the initial state of the receiving qubit b and the spin bus is to possess @xmath124 symmetry , a condition that can be fulfilled by several configurations concerning the spin bus , ranging from the fully polarized state to the highly - entangled ground state . if a large magnetic field can be switched on during the initialization procedure ( in order to fully polarize the channel ) , and switched off as soon as the transmission starts , then , from our analytical treatment it emerges that temperature is not a major issue as far as the dynamical evolution of the channel is concerned , though low temperatures are obviously necessary to protect the qubits from phase and amplitude damping due to the solid - state environment . to judge",
