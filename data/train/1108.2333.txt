    "the extremal limit for four dimensional reissner nordstrm ( rn ) black holes has been extensively studied recently @xcite to probe whether the limit is continuous .",
    "the definition of the entropy function @xcite used to compare the ` macroscopic ' entropy of a class of extremal black holes solutions of the supergravity limit of string theories , to the ` microscopic ' entropy obtained from counting of string states @xcite requires a bifurcate horizon -an attribute that extremal spacetimes do not possess .",
    "the trick of using a generic near - extremal black hole spacetime to evaluate the entropy function , though widely used in the literature , suffers from the pitfall that the extremal limit may have subtle discontinuities @xcite , @xcite , and may be different from the precisely extremal geometry . on our part , it has been shown @xcite that there exists a class of stable circular orbits on the event horizon of the extremal reissner nordstrm spacetime which coincides with the principal null geodesic generator of the horizon .",
    "the spacetime infinitesimally near the extremal does not admit this class of geodesics .    in this paper",
    "we examine similar features of the _ kerr _ spacetime : whether in the extremal limit there exist geodesics on the horizon which can be characterized as iscos , as compared with the precisely extremal situation . here , we employ carter s @xcite maximal analytic extension instead to investigate the continuity of the extremal limit vis - a - vis the class of circular geodesics mentioned . while the use of conserved scalars like ` energy ' and ` angular momentum ' of test particles , both massive and massless , to study their geodesics , is usually deemed quite adequate in any coordinate system , here , there is a word of caution : since the geodesics in question lie _ on _ the horizon ( and coincide with the null geodesic generator @xcite , @xcite ) , the use of coordinate charts smooth on the horizon is certainly preferable to the use of charts which are not .",
    "otherwise one may be led to conclusions which may have additional subtle pitfalls .",
    "the main result that emerges from our assay is what has been suspected earlier @xcite and pointed out recently @xcite for the reissner nordstrm spacetime : _ all aspects of the extremal kerr spacetime do not manifest themselves in the near - extremal limit_. in particular , the class of geodesics close to the horizon in the extremal case does not overlap with the class in the case that we are infinitesimally close to the extremal .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ mot ] , we motivate our paper by showing that the order in which the near - extremal and the near - horizon limits of the kerr metric are taken , is important , following a similar demonstration made in @xcite for the rn spacetime .",
    "the near horizon geometry of the extremal black hole is _ not _ the same as the extremal limit of the near - horizon geometry of the generic non - extremal black hole . in section [ symm ] , the carter analytic extension of the kerr spacetime",

    "of course , for the latter case , the behavior of the spacetime away from a bifurcation surface is what is being considered .",
    "the maximal analytic extension of the extremal kerr spacetime along the axis of symmetry was first reported by carter @xcite . since , there is no discussion in the literature about the discontinuity of this extension at the extremal limit @xmath13 , we present here the complete maximal analytic extension following carter , showing that in the extremal limit @xmath13 it is indeed discontinuous , necessitating a separate treatment .",

    "conserved quantities like test particle energy and angular momentum ( both per unit mass ) are defined in terms of killing vector fields corresponding to stationarity and axisymmetry of the kerr spacetime .",
    "e.g. , the energy is defined as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the four velocity of the test particle and @xmath54 is the energy per unit mass of the test particle .",

    "we will be describe it in more detail . now using the normalization condition of four velocity and for circular orbit we get the part of the squared potential along the symmetry axis @xmath57 where @xmath58 for timelike geodesics and @xmath59 for null geodesics .",
    "in other words , the isco turns into a null geodesic on the horizon @xmath60 with the energy vanishing as well .",

    "hence as @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the squared potentials corresponding to the timelike and null cases respectively .",
    "this implies that in the extremal geometry , the geodesic on the horizon corresponds to the null geodesic generator .",
    "to compute the effective potential for circular orbits we choose nonsingular coordinates like ingoing kerr coordinates rather than the boyer lindquist coordinates . in this coordinate system",
    "the metric@xcite can be written as @xmath65 & & + \\frac{1}{\\rho^2 } \\ , \\left[(r^2+a^2)^2-\\delta a^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right ] \\ , \\sin^2\\theta d\\tilde{\\phi}^2   -\\frac{4amr}{\\rho^2 } \\ , \\sin^2\\theta d\\tilde{\\phi}dv~.\\label{inke}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the transformations @xmath66 we obtain the doran form of kerr metric@xcite which is as follows : @xmath67 ^ 2+\\rho^2{d\\theta}^2 + ( r^2+a^2)\\sin^2{\\theta}{d\\phi}^2~.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{pg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      on the equatorial plane @xmath68 , the extremal kerr metric in doran coordinates is given by @xmath69 & & + \\left[r^2+m^2+\\frac{2m^3}{r}\\right]d\\phi^2~.\\label{epg1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in doran coordinates , the spacetime allows the timelike killing vector @xmath70 , whose projection along the four velocity @xmath71 ( @xmath72 for timelike and @xmath73 for null ) of geodesics : @xmath74 , is conserved along such geodesics .",
    "there is also the ` angular momentum ' @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 ) which is similarly conserved .",

    "because of this degeneracy , a nontrivial solution for @xmath84 ensues if and only if @xmath85 . the norm of the four velocity at @xmath41 is thus @xmath86 implying that this is a null geodesic generator of the horizon .",
    "this agrees with the foregoing analysis in the carter frame in the previous section . precisely on the event horizon in the exactly extremal geometry",

    "however , it is not clear that eq.([uufx1 ] ) does lead to that , except for a specific order of limits mentioned above .",
    "thus , in the extremal limit , we do have @xmath81 , but to get @xmath97 , we must move slightly away from the horizon @xmath98 ; but this new hypersurface is not necessarily null , so the geodesic on it need not be null . on the other hand ,",
    "if we move away from extremality @xmath81 , then the near - horizon value of @xmath99 diverges , and one can scarcely claim the existence of a null geodesic generator .",
    "there may be a way to evaluate the limits simultaneously , but it is not clear how that establishes that the geodesic on the horizon at extremality is null .",
    "this conundrum is related to the issues mentioned in the introduction , which motivate our primary contention that the extremal limit and the exactly extremal spacetimes have subtle disparities .",
    "it may be noted that our computational results in this subsection are consistent with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , as they are with those of the earlier paper @xcite",
    ". however , rather than focus on the proper distance between the bifurcation sphere ( nonexistent in the precisely extremal geometry ) and the geodesic in question , we have chosen here to focus on the squared norm of the geodesic on the horizon in the extremal limit , and compare it with the behaviour in the exactly extremal situation .",
    "it is not enough to merely argue that the extremal limit exists , it is important to establish that an independent treatment of the exactly extremal case yields the same results as in the limiting situation . since the precisely extremal situation has not been analyzed in @xcite , the comparison of the results there with those in the exactly extremal geometry can not be made .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we have already discussed the exactly extremal kerr geometry in the last subsection , where ambiguities in evaluating limits seen in this subsection are not present .",
    "this is yet another instance of the subtle disparity between the exactly extremal and the extremal limit of a non - extremal kerr spacetime , as we have contended , now observed within the doran frame . in the next section ,",
    "we reanalyze the extremal situation using carter s maximal analytic extension of the extremal kerr geometry .",
    "in section [ tcgh ] we observed that both doran and ingoing kerr coordinates are better behaved at @xmath41 than the boyer - lindquist coordinates ; but they are not fully well behaved because _ _  the outgoing coordinates describe in a non - pathological manner the ejection of particles outward from @xmath100 through @xmath101 ; but their descriptions of in fall through @xmath102 has the same pathology as the description given by schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "similarly , the ingoing coordinates describe well the in fall of a particle through @xmath103 , but they give a pathological description of outgoing trajectories ...",
    "\"__@xcite[page-831 ] .",
    "this is exactly the same pathology of boyer - lindquist coordinates for the descriptions of kerr spacetimes also .",
    "so here we will use carter s coordinates / universal like coordinates for the particular @xmath41 geodesics on the horizon .",
    "carter s coordinates are explicitly derived in appendix [ app ] . without loss of generality we set @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the equatorial plane . therefore from ( [ muvx ] )",
    "the extremal kerr metric on the equatorial plane can be written as @xmath106 & & + { \\cal d}\\left(\\sec^2u\\ , du+\\csc^2v\\ , dv\\right)d\\phi^{\\star } ~.\\label{metex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 ~.\\label{b}\\\\ { \\cal c}&=&\\frac{(r^2+m^2)^2}{r^2}-m^2 \\ , ( 1-\\frac{m}{r})^2,\\ , { \\cal d}=\\frac{1}{2}m \\ , ( 1-\\frac{m}{r})^2-\\frac{(m^4-r^4)}{2mr^2 } ~.\\label{d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for our simplicity we take @xmath108 instead of @xmath109 in the subsequent analysis .",

    "does it coincide with the null generators of the horizon ?",
    "note that in this coordinates the horizon is at @xmath124 , @xmath125 and for circular geodesics on the future horizon @xmath126 and the norm of the four velocity may be defined as @xmath127 once again , as in the doran frame for the exactly extremal kerr geometry , the geodesic on the horizon will be a null geodesic generator only if @xmath128 .",
    "this also implies that the energy @xmath54 must also vanish for the geodesic on the horizon .    alternatively for timelike circular geodesics @xmath129 , using ( [ dotu ] ,  [ ph ] ) one",
    "obtain the energy equation for timelike circular geodesics as @xmath130 where @xmath131 therefore the effective potential for timelike circular geodesics may be written as @xmath132 similarly the effective potential for null circular geodesics can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 it shows that the future horizon of the spacetime is given by @xmath125 with @xmath135 arbitrary : in other words @xmath136 .",
    "one can compute the derivatives in the equations ( [ xtan ] ) ; it turns out that @xmath137 , while the other derivative of @xmath138 is regular on the horizon .",
    "now on the future horizon @xmath139 @xmath140 which implies @xmath141 and @xmath142 on the horizon .",
    "it follows that @xmath77 is a finite quantity which is vanishing on the horizon .",
    "it is also further observed that timelike circular geodesics and null circular geodesics _",
    "coalesce into a zero energy trajectory _ ( as in the rn case @xcite ) @xmath143 thus , the geodesic on the horizon must coincide with the principal null geodesic generator .",
    "the existence of a timelike circular orbit turning into the null geodesic generator on the event horizon is a peculiar feature of exactly extremal kerr spacetime .",
    "another view of this discontinuity is gleaned from the absence of outer trapped surfaces within the horizon in the extremal geometry in contrast to a more generic situation , as we now discuss .",
    "in a most general spacetime @xmath144 with the metric @xmath145 having signature @xmath146 , one can define two future directed null vectors @xmath147 and @xmath148 whose expansion scalars are given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the metric induced by @xmath145 on the two dimensional spacelike surface formed by spatial foliation of the null hypersurface generated by @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "then ( i ) a two dimensional spacelike surface s is said to be a _ trapped _",
    "surface if both @xmath151 and @xmath152 ; ( ii ) s is to be _ marginally trapped _",
    "surface if one of two null expansions vanish i.e. @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "the null vectors for non - extremal kerr black hole are given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath18 .",
    "the null vectors satisfy the following conditions : @xmath157 using ( [ expa ] ) , one obtains @xmath158 in the region @xmath159 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "this implies that trapped surfaces exist for non extreme kerr black hole in this region .",
    "in contrast , for the extreme kerr black hole @xmath160 here inside or outside extremal horizon @xmath161 or @xmath162 , @xmath151 and @xmath163 .",
    "this implies that there are no trapped surfaces for extremal kerr black hole beyond the event horizon .",
    "the study reveals the disparity between precisely extremely and nearly extremely geometry manifested in the fact that the near - extremal and near - horizon _ limits _ do _ not _ commute , and also the singular nature of the extremal limit of carter s maximal analytic extension of a generic kerr geometry .",
    "we also showed that to study the geodesics close to the horizon , one must first go to the _ precisely _ extremal geometry , before considering geodesics ( near or on ) the horizon by using carter s frame which is well - behaved on the horizon .",
    "while doran and ingoing - kerr coordinates can also be used to reach the same conclusion , this is arrived at in the latter frames only through careful limiting procedures .",
    "another feature of our work is that using carter s frame the direct isco in extremal kerr spacetime , which lies _ on _ the event horizon , coincides with the principal null geodesic generator ; such an isco is non - existent in the near - extremal geometry .",
    "we have compared the results here with that in the work of jacobson @xcite where it is also inferred that the isco on the horizon in the extremal case coincides with the null geodesic generator . for the near - extremal geometry , our results for the energy and angular momentum per unit mass agree with those in this work , and also with the earlier results of @xcite ( which is , surprisingly , not referred to in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the demonstration that the norm of the 4-velocity of the geodesic on the horizon must vanish in the extremal limit poses some challenging manipulations involving limits . in @xcite ,",
    "a way around this problem has been sought by considering the proper spatial separation between the geodesic in question , and the bifurcation sphere which does indeed exist in the near - extremal geometry . however , as emphasized in section ivb , it is not enough to argue that the extremal limit of a few quantities like the energy and momentum exist and are non - zero .",
    "one must analyze separately the exactly extremal geoemtry and compare the results with those in the extremal limit to exhibit the absence of subtleties in that limit .",
    "this has _ not _ been done in @xcite , since the exactly extremal situation has not been considered there .",
    "indeed , for this geometry , there is no bifurcation sphere , and therefore arguments involving the proper distance between the geodesic and the bifurcation sphere can not be made in this case .",
    "rather , as we have unambiguously demonstrated in sections iva and v , for the exactly extremal geometry , the geodesic on the horizon has vanishing norm provided the energy and angular momentum per unit mass vanish .",
    "the demonstrations in this case are far more straightforward , requiring no subtle manipulations of limits .    in sum",
    ", we hope to have persuaded the reader that the extremal limit of a generic non - extremal kerr spacetime has subtle disparities from the precisely extremal situation .",
    "the evidence presented in favour of our contention is threefold : first of all , it is the absence of a unique maximal analytic extension of the non - extremal kerr spacetime covering both the event and cauchy horizons , thus leading to a divergent metric in the extremal limit of such an extension . in other words ,",
    "the maximal analytic extension of the extremal kerr goemetry had to be worked out separately , rather than by a limiting procedure on the generic spacetime .",
    "secondly , the existence of an isco which turns into the null geodesic generator of the horizon in the extremal case , with vanishing energy and angular momentum per unit mass . in the near - extremal situation , this demonstration is complicated because to show that the norm of the geodesic vanishes on the horizon requires careful handling of limits . finally , our demonstration of the absence of trapped surfaces in the extremal spacetime , which tallies well with the other properties of the extremal spacetime noted here .",
    "what we have apparently established has implications for extant approaches to computing the wald entropy function for extremal black holes .",
    "it is not clear that current assays in this direction actually compute extremal black hole entropy ; rather , the results are most likely for some sort of entanglement entropy of ambient matter in the field of such black holes .",
    "the maximal analytic extension of the non - extremal kerr spacetime along the off axis of symmetry was first reported by carter @xcite . as we showed for symmetry axis",

    "<S> the fact that one must evaluate the near - extremal and near - horizon limits of kerr spacetime in a specific order , is shown to lead to discontinuity in the extremal limit , such that this limiting spacetime differs nontrivially from the precisely extremal spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> this is established by first showing a discontinuity in the extremal limit of the maximal analytic extension of the kerr geometry , given by carter . </S>",
    "<S> next , we examine the isco of the exactly extremal kerr geometry and show that on the event horizon of the extremal kerr black hole , it coincides with the principal null geodesic generator of the horizon , having vanishing energy and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is no such isco in the near - extremal geometry , thus garnering additional support for our primary contention . </S>",
