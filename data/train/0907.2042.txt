    "odd - frequency triplet superconducting correlations with non - zero total spin projection induced by proximity effect in heterostructures containing superconductors with ordinary singlet pairing and inhomogeneous ferromagnets have been of considerable interest in the last decade .",
    "@xcite odd - frequency pairing mechanism was proposed long ago in an attempt to describe the a phase of superfluid @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite although this superconducting state is thermodynamically stable ,  @xcite it was found that in the case of superfluid @xmath6 the pairing is odd in space ( @xmath7-wave ) rather than in time , `` odd '' triplet superconductivity occurs in certain superconductor - ferromagnet ( sf ) structures .",
    "@xcite it is believed that this exotic @xmath8-wave pairing state which is even in momentum , but with the triplet correlations being odd in frequency , can enhance significantly the superconducting penetration length at the sf interface ,  @xcite providing a josephson current through half - metallic barriers .",
    "@xcite the simplest examples of sf heterostructures with inhomogeneous magnetization are fsf and sffs heterojunctions with homogeneous monodomain ferromagnetic layers having an angle @xmath4 between their in - plane magnetizations .",
    "these structures have been studied using quasiclassical approach in both diffusive  @xcite and clean  @xcite limits by solving usadel  @xcite and eilenberger  @xcite equations , respectively , and by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "@xcite in the case of parallel ( @xmath9 ) magnetizations , sfs junctions ,  @xcite besides spin - singlet superconducting correlations , only odd triplet correlations with zero total spin projection exist .",
    "these correlations penetrate into the ferromagnet over a short length scale determined by the exchange energy . for noncollinear magnetizations , triplet correlations with nonzero spin projection",
    "are present as well .",
    "it is expected that they are not suppressed by the exchange interaction , and consequently that they are long ranged .",
    "@xcite it has been predicted for diffusive junctions that long - range spin - triplet components with spin projection @xmath10 should have a dramatic impact on transport properties and the josephson effect , displayed through a nonmonotonic dependence on angle between magnetizations . in diffusive josephson junctions ,",
    "the length scales associated with short- and long - range correlations are , respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the diffusion constant in the ferromagnet , and thermal energy @xmath14 is typically much smaller than the exchange energy @xmath15 .",
    "however , this is not the case in ballistic sf heterostructures in which the only characteristic length is the ferromagnet coherence length @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fermi velocity . in the clean limit ,",
    "influence of misorientation of magnetizations on the josephson current or conductance can not be attributed to the triplet correlations .",
    "@xcite moreover , for noncollinear magnetizations , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , both spin singlet and triplet pair amplitudes in ferromagnetic layers decay in the same oscillatory manner with distance from the fs interfaces .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study the josephson effect and odd - frequency triplet superconductivity in clean and moderately disordered sffs junctions where the magnetic interlayer consists of two monodomain ferromagnets having relative angle @xmath4 between their in - plane magnetizations . solving the eilenberger equations we calculate singlet and triplet pair amplitudes , and the josephson current .",
    "in contrast to the dirty limit case we find that for @xmath5 , both spin singlet and triplet pair amplitudes in f layers are oscillating and power low decaying with distance from the fs interfaces . this decay gets faster as the impurity - scattering rate in ferromagnets is increased .",
    "the computed triplet amplitudes have opposite signs in the two magnet regions , penetrate into the superconductors and monotonically decay over the superconducting coherence length , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the superconducting pair potential , which is the same distance on which the singlet amplitude saturates to the bulk value . as in the previous work ,",
    "@xcite no substantial impact of spin - triplet superconducting correlation on the josephson current has been found .",
    "the critical value of the josephson current @xmath22 is a monotonic function of angle @xmath4 when the junction is far enough from the @xmath23 transitions . otherwise , @xmath24 is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath4 with characteristic dips related to the onset of @xmath23 transitions , but this nonmonotonicity is a consequence of decreasing influence of the exchange potential with increasing misorientation of magnetizations .",
    "@xcite influence of misorientation of magnetizations on the josephson current can not be attributed to the appearance of triplet correlations : with increasing misorientation of magnetizations , @xmath25 , the josephson currents are the same as for parallel magnetizations , @xmath9 , with correspondingly decreasing exchange potential , @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , rotation of magnetizations in sffs junctions is equivalent to the decreasing influence of the homogeneous exchange potential , in the absence of triplet correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model and the solutions of eilenberger equations that we used to calculate the josephson current and spin - singlet and -triplet pair amplitudes . in sec .",
    "iii we present the numerical results , and the conclusion in sec .",
