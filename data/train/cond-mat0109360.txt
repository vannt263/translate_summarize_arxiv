    "its unusual phase diagram and thermodynamics show that it is unconventional .",
    "the precise nature of its superconducting order parameter remains elusive , however .",
    "from the purely theoretical point of view , order parameters ( ops ) that transform according to a single representation of the @xmath8 group and that take into account spin - orbit coupling are the most desirable .",
    "this includes the @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite theories .",
    "because of the perception that these theories may not give sufficient phenomenological flexibility , other pictures have been constructed .",
    "one of these is the mixed - representation ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath3-@xmath9 ) @xcite picture .",
    "this suffers from the problem of fine tuning , since the coupling constants of the two representations must be nearly identical to account for the nearness of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "another picture is the extended - symmetry - group spin triplet theory @xcite .",
    "however , this requires zero spin - orbit coupling in an @xmath12-electron system , an artificial assumption .    from the point of view of comparison to experiment ,",
    "the most stringent constraints on theory come from detailed measurements of the thermal conductivity @xmath13 @xcite and the ultrasonic attenuation @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "because of the directional information inherent in these probes , they offer the best chance to distinguish between order parameters that may have only relatively subtle differences @xcite .",
    "this expectation is reinforced by the fact that the ultrasonic attenuation has been measured in the @xmath3 phase , the most anisotropic of the zero - field phases .",
    "previous calculations have indicated that the mixed representation and extended symmetry group scenarios are probably inconsistent with these measurements @xcite .",
    "accordingly we focus in this paper on the @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories .",
    "our aim is to compare theory and experiment for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in a quantitative fashion . in so doing",

    "standard calculations for the @xmath1 model use a singlet gap function @xmath21 ,   \\label{eq : del1}\\]]while for the @xmath2 model conventional calculations use the triplet gap function @xmath22 , \\label{eq : d1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-component of @xmath25 vector on the fermi surface and @xmath26 is the direction of the vector @xmath27 in pseudospin space .",

    "there are two levels of doing phenomenology for the op .",

    "they are _ continuous _ functions of all the many parameters that are in the microscopic hamiltonian , as well as external variables such as pressure . thus choosing a representation means choosing a _ set _ of hamiltonians of finite measure , i.e. , to selecting an alternative that has a finite _ a priori _ probability .",
    "the other ( more commonly used ) level of phenomenology is to choose a specific basis function from table  [ tab : e1 g ] or table  [ tab : e2u ] and work out the consequences .",
    "this means setting all but one of the @xmath41 or @xmath43 equal to zero .",
    "it also means choosing a set of hamiltonians of zero measure , which has zero _ a priori _ probability . in other words , choosing a specific basis function amounts to fine tuning .",
    "none of the @xmath41 or @xmath43 can vanish by symmetry , since all symmetries of the system have already been taken into account in the group - theoretical decomposition .",
    "this does not necessarily invalidate previous work that has been done with a specific choice of basis function .",
    "if the comparison to experimental data is not very sensitive to variations in @xmath41 or @xmath44 then the fine tuning may be abandoned without harming agreement of theory and observation .",
    "a key goal of this paper is to investigate this sensitivity for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 theories .",

    "we have verified that these functions are close to the ginzburg - landau result near @xmath10 and they have the appropriate behavior at low temperature as well .",

    "@xmath28 so that , as stated above , only the @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) functions are used .",
    "however , the theory requires that the superconducting op is oriented by its coupling to the staggered antiferromagnetic moment @xmath67 there are three domains allowed by symmetry for @xmath68 , and neutron scattering experiments show that they are equally populated .",

    "the observed @xmath73 must result from an average over domains .",
    "in such a situation , response functions are usually calculated by effective medium theory , which may take various forms , depending on the approximations made @xcite . however , the present case is simplified by the fact that @xmath73 is the relatively small imaginary part of a large complex quantity , the sound propagation vector .",

    "in particular , the overall _ anisotropy _ is well fit .",
    "some discrepancies may be noted at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the fits for @xmath73 are also reasonable except that some minor discrepancies may be noted near @xmath58 in the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the best - fit parameters for @xmath1 are : @xmath77 , @xmath61 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 , while the best - fit parameters for @xmath2 are : @xmath80 , @xmath61 , and all the coefficients @xmath81 vanish except @xmath82 .",
    "there exists a major difference between the best fits of @xmath1 and @xmath2 models when anisotropic masses are considered . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the anisotropic mass ratio is fixed as @xmath83 .",
    "this agrees with the measured value @xcite for the dominant @xmath84 band . for @xmath2 , in contrast",
    ", the best fits are acquired at @xmath85 , in very poor agreement with the measured value .      in order to give some idea of the sensitivity of the fits to the anisotropic mass ratio",
    ", we calculate @xmath73 and @xmath13 for @xmath2 model using the same best - fit parameters except for the anisotropic mass ratio @xmath74 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , as the ratio is increased from 0.33 to its physical value of 2.5 , the polarization anisotropy in @xmath73 decreases sharply , while the anisotropy in @xmath13 actually reverses .",
    "this indicates that the fit for the @xmath2 model is somewhat questionable .",
    "our fitting procedure differs from that of graf _ et al .",
    "these authors used revised order parameters    @xmath86(1+a_2 { k}_{z}^2+a_4 { k}_{z}^4)\\ ] ]    for @xmath1 and    @xmath87 ( 1+a_2 { k}_{z}^2+a_4 { k}_{z}^4)\\ ] ]    for @xmath2 , where the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 are adjustable fitting parameters .",
    "since the additional factor is completely symmetric , this does not change the representation . as opposed to using the standard basis functions ( @xmath90 )",
    ", it is evident that large @xmath88 and @xmath89 will correspond to more electronic excitations around the line of nodes at @xmath91 .",
    "this in turn will enhance the in - plane thermal conductivity and sound attenuation relative to the out - of - plane ones .",
    "roughly speaking , the larger @xmath88 or @xmath89 case for the revised model is physically analogous to having @xmath92 ( and hence larger in - plane density of states ) in the standard model .",
    "this change in the gap function amounts to multiplying the relative contribution of the in - plane excitations by a factor of 12 relative to what one would expect from the measured ratio of effective masses .      in order to fit the data in the @xmath3 phase ,",
    "it is necessary to choose the most favorable domain .",
    "this was also found by graf _",
    "as mentioned above , this is not consistent with the assumptions of the theory .",
    "the idea that the order parameter is oriented by @xmath68 is a central assumption for both pictures , since it accounts for the fact that @xmath93 is isotropic in the basal plane .",
    "thus domain averaging is not optional : it is necessary for the consistency of the theory .",
    "the best fits of ultrasound attenuation data taking into account three equal - populated domain average .",
    "the best fits for one single domain ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) are included for comparison .",
    "the curves for @xmath94 and @xmath95 are indistinguishable . ]",
    "if the absorption is properly averaged over all three domains , then we obtain the best fit for the two theories shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the @xmath3 phase ,",
    "the fits are substantially worse than those one gets by choosing the best domain , as was done for fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reason for the difference in the quality of fit in the @xmath3 phase is mainly due to the node patterns . in the @xmath9 phase , for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 models , there are lines of nodes along the equator and point nodes at the poles of the fermi surface . in this phase , the nodal pattern is symmetric about the @xmath70-axis and thus the real nodal structures are virtually the same in the three different domains . in the @xmath3 phase , in contrast , the two point nodes at the pole have connected to form line nodes in the @xmath96 plane for @xmath1 and the @xmath97 planes for @xmath2 model ( in the domain defined by the basis functions of tables  [ tab : e1 g ] and [ tab : e2u ] ) . in this case , the nodal structure is asymmetric about the @xmath70-axis .",
    "depending on the orientation of the node pattern relative to the direction of polarization / propagation , the three domains contribute differently . as a matter of fact ,",
    "as compared to an isotropic state , transverse sound with @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( denoted as @xmath100 ) will cause fewer excitations in the @xmath101 or @xmath102 rotated domains .",
    "it is this that causes the @xmath103 ( the angle brackets indicate a three equal - populated domains average ) attenuation to drop significantly in the @xmath3 phase relative to the @xmath100 attenuation .",
    "in contrast , the best fits for the @xmath94 and @xmath104 attenuations are almost indistinguishable .",
    "these considerations apply equally to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models .",
    "an important criterion for the acceptance of a theory is its robustness . if small changes in the parameters would spoil the agreement with the data , the theory is not acceptable since it lacks explanatory power .",
    "accordingly , we investigate the sensitivity of the op s transport characteristics to changes in its shape . we shall focus on the @xmath9 phase for reasons that will become clear below .    for @xmath105 varying",
    "the shape is relatively straightforward .",
    "there are only two parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in the @xmath9 phase with @xmath108",
    "there are lines of nodes along the equator and point nodes at the poles . changing",
    "the ratio of @xmath106 and @xmath107 does not affect this nodal pattern .",
    "a larger value of @xmath107 merely gives additional modulation to the order parameter in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we show some representative curves for @xmath109 for different values of the ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "there is very little change in the goodness of fit as the ratio is varied . defining a chi - square parameter for the fits as a function of @xmath110 , we see from its approximate constancy that the @xmath1 theory is robust for this particular quantity .",
    "( a ) the ratio of @xmath109 for different ratios of @xmath110 for the @xmath1 model .",
    "( b ) the ratio of @xmath109 for different ratios of @xmath111 for the @xmath2 model . ]    the @xmath2 order parameter behaves very differently . for starters",
    ", the shape space @xmath112 is six - dimensional .",
    "this precludes an extensive search .",
    "however , mapping of a two - dimensional subspace will suffice to make the point about parameter sensitivity .",
    "the main difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is clear from the nodal pattern .",
    "taking into account @xmath113 in addition to the usual @xmath114 , when @xmath115 there is a line of nodes at the equator and point nodes at the poles in the @xmath9 phase .",
    "when @xmath113 is finite , however , the line of nodes disappears .",
    "this is a consequence of blount s theorem @xcite , which states that triplet states in a spin - orbit coupled system do not have lines of nodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , we show some representative curves for @xmath116 for different values of the ratio @xmath111 .",
    "the curves are very sensitive to the ratio , in particular at low temperatures .",
    "the chi - square parameter varies rapidly as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2 theory is not robust .",
    "its virtues in describing the data arise from a fine - tuning of the parameters .",
    "order parameters belonging to the two - dimensional representations @xmath1 and @xmath2 remain as the main candidates for the superconducting state of upt@xmath0 .",
    "a difficulty that remains for both these theories is the explanation of the ultrasonic absorption in the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the theories require that the observed absorption be the result of an average over three domains in which the order parameter has three orientations .",
    "this averaging is deleterious to the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "this may indicate that there is something wrong with the idea that the magnetization orients the superconductivity , or it may indicate that there is an additional scattering mechanism , such as scattering from domain walls , which partially cancels the drop in absorption due to gap formation .",
    "the @xmath2 theory has an additional severe problem at low temperatures .",
    "a line of nodes at the equator of the fermi surface is required in order to give agreement with experiment for the thermal conductivity . in the six - dimensional parameter space of this theory , this occurs only in a two - dimensional subspace .",
    "the theory therefore requires fine - tuning to explain the data : all the parameters in the microscopic interaction must conspire to give the desired result .",
    "it has been suggested that strong spin - orbit coupling can lock the @xmath117-vector along the @xmath118-direction .",
    "however , @xmath117 does not have the interpretation of zero spin projection , as it does in @xmath119he . taking into account",
    "the spin - orbit coupling reduces the order parameter space to six dimensions for triplet @xmath120 , not one or two .    since the shape parameters @xmath43 depend on all the details of the microscopic hamiltonian , the low temperature power laws that depend on having a line of nodes are unstable .",
    "by contrast , the line of nodes at the equator in the @xmath1 theory is forced by symmetry .",
    "application of _ pressure _ , for example would lift these nodes in an @xmath2 gap .",
    "the pressure scale that governs superconducting phenomena may be estimated as @xmath121 .",
    "one would expect very strong pressure dependence of the thermal conductivity on this scale at low temperatures for @xmath2 but not for @xmath1 .",
    "this could serve to further distinguish the two theories .",
    "the data presently give preference to the @xmath1 theory since it does not require fine tuning to explain the data .",
    "the discrepancy of theory and experiment for ultrasonic absorption in the @xmath3 phase has not been resolved , and may require new ideas ."
