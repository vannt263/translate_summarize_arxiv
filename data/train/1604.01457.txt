    "the eruption leads to a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) spanning an angular width of @xmath0120@xmath12 ( see the lasco cme catalog ) and apparently ignites the loop system to the immediate north .",
    "the two loop systems are referred to hereafter as the northern and southern loop system ( nls and sls ) , respectively .",
    "both take the shape of a candle flame in sdo / aia s hot passbands such as 131 and 94 , and are located beneath a larger cusp - shaped structure ( figure [ fig : rec ] ) .",

    "* ) at 5-min cadence and @xmath13 angular resolution .",
    "the appearance of the brightening nls at @xmath1401:40 ut in euvi 195 is preceded by a co - spatial dimming ( figure [ fig : rec](c ) ) , presumably corresponding to hot loops in aia 131 .",
    "both loop systems are oriented in a north - south direction , and apparently nls s southern footpoints are co - located with sls s northern footpoints .",
    "during the decay phase , some post - flare loops in both nls and sls brighten sequentially as if propagating eastward in sta 195 , and these loops are also visible in the euv passbands of sdo / aia ( see the animation accompanying figure[fig : rec ] ) .",
    "this is the `` zipper '' effect mentioned in passing in @xcite .",
    "we placed two virtual slits ( s1 and s2 ) across the loop top of nls ( figure [ fig : rec ] ) . taking the average pixel value across the slit yields an one - dimensional array for each image , and stacking up these arrays in time sequence generates the time - distance maps in figure [ fig : tempo ] ( c  f ) .",
    "the post - flare loops undergoing slipping motions appear at @xmath001:40 ut , leaving a bright track in the time - distance maps .",
    "there is a @xmath040-min delay relative to the appearance of hot loops in 131 ; during this period , the dimming ( figure[fig : rec](c ) ) preceding the post - flare loops in euvi 195 appears to propagates eastward ( figure[fig : tempo](f ) ; see also the animation accompanying figure[fig : rec ] ) .",
    "the post - flare loops undergoing slipping motions are co - spatial in aia 131 , 335 and 193 , and co - temporal with the enhanced eve irradiance in 335 , suggesting that they have a ` warm ' temperature of 23 mk .",
    "fitting the tracks in figure [ fig : tempo ] ( e ) and ( f ) linearly , we obtained a projected speed of @xmath06 km / s in aia 193 and @xmath09 km / s in euvi 195 .",
    "hence the ` true ' speed of the loop top is estimated to be @xmath1511 km / s , as the two perspectives are almost orthogonal .",
    "note in figure[fig : tempo](f ) the horizontal tracks are produced by apparently stationary loops ; the sloped tracks due to slipping motions are rather rugged and incoherent , which is partly due to sta s poor spatio - temporal resolution , but may as well indicate a varying speed from sta s perspective .      ]",
    "we used the paired euvi 195 and aia 193 images for stereoscopic reconstruction with ` scc_measure ` in solarsoftware , taking advantage of the similar temperature response of the two passbands .",
    "two instants , 01:40 ut and 02:25 ut , are chosen when the loops can be clearly identified from both perspectives ( figure[fig : rec](e ) , ( f ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) ) .",
    "the reconstructed loops ( figure [ fig:3d ] ) have two far ends ( a and b ) more or less fixed , but their co - located footpoints in the center move from c to d at an average speed of @xmath015 km / s ( calculated with the great - circle distance ) .",
    "one must keep in mind that these loops do not jump from c to d but go through a series of intermediate steps ( see the animation accompanying figure[fig : rec ] ) .",
    "naturally this speed exceeds the loop - top speed ( @xmath011 km / s ) as a and b are anchored . assuming that the loops outline field lines , we conclude that their slippage speed falls safely into the sub - alfvnic regime .",
    "one might relate the slippage to an increase in magnetic shear of individual loops , which is however contrary to the conventionally observed strong - to - weak shear change of post - flare loops @xcite . to understand the actual scenario ,",

    "[ fig : mag ] ]    we used a vector magnetogram obtained by helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on 2011 january 22 , six days before the flare , when the ar is located near the disk center , hence providing reliable field measurements .",
    "the magnetogram is de - projected to the heliographic coordinates with a lambert ( cylindrical equal area ) projection method @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mag](a ) shows the photospheric @xmath20 , based on which a potential field is extrapolated , using the fourier transform method @xcite .",
    "the part of active region relevant to the flare exhibits a locally tripolar configuration ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with diffusive positive - polarity patches ( p ) located in between two sunspots of negative polarity ( n1 and n2 ) , roughly corresponding to the footpoints near a and b in figure [ fig:3d ] .",
    "employing the code introduced in @xcite , we calculated the squashing factor @xmath17 in a box volume , whose bottom is indicated by the rectangle in figure[fig : mag](a ) .",
    "figure[fig : mag](b ) shows the photospheric @xmath21 map , where @xmath22 @xcite and red ( blue ) colors represent positive ( negative ) polarity .",
    "the most outstanding feature is that the red high-@xmath23 line oriented in the east - west direction in the center is ( partially ) circled by blue high-@xmath23 lines .",
    "field lines ( colored curves in figure [ fig : mag](a ) ) randomly traced from this red high-@xmath17 line ( marked by plus symbols ) are similar to the reconstructed loops in projection ( white thick curves in figure [ fig : mag](a ) ) , except that the loops southern footpoints appear displaced to the east of n2 , presumably due to the differential rotation .",
    "as expected , these field lines are relatively rigid towards the footpoints near the sunspots ( n1 and n2 ) due to the intensified field strength and maxwellian stresses , but flexible towards the weak field region in between ( p ) , where the observed slipping motions take place .",
    "the presence of a hyperbolic flux tube ( hft ) , which separates the arcade connecting p - n1 from that connecting p - n2 , is demonstrated by the isosurface of @xmath24 ( figure [ fig : mag](c ) ) and the 2d cut in the y - z plane ( figure [ fig : mag](d ) ) .",
    "one can see that two adjoining half - domes are separated by a sheet - like surface .",
    "the former s footprint corresponds to the circular blue high - q lines and the latter s the red high - q line in the center on the photospheric @xmath25 map , along which the footpoints of the post - flare loops are observed to slip .",
    "it is therefore highly suggestive that these loops undergo slipping magnetic reconnections at the intersection of the two qsls , i.e. , the center of the hft , where the squashing degree is most intense ( marked by an arrow in figure[fig : mag](d ) ) .",
    "the reconnection at the hft may be triggered by the initiation of the flare within the sls , which leads to the nls s brightening .",
    "the propagative dimming in euvi 195 ( figure[fig : rec](c ) ) during the main phase ( figure[fig : tempo](f ) ) could be a manifestation of hot loops undergoing similar slipping motions .",
    "there exist three other qsl branches with less intensity and therefore less relevance ( figure [ fig : mag](c ) and ( d ) ) , one is inside the southern half dome , one circles around the southern half dome from outside , and another cutting through the northern half dome .",
    "]    we used the differential emission measure ( dem ) method @xcite to analyze the temperature structure of the post - flare loop system with the six aia euv passbands ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis is facilitated by the dem - weighted mean temperature , @xmath26 where the denominator gives emission measure ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the dem results show that the cusp - shaped structures only appear in high temperature bins exceeding 8 mk ( see figure [ fig : dem ] ) . in the temperature maps ( rightmost column in figure [ fig : dem ] ) , each candle flame has a similar temperature distribution as the famous tsuneta flare @xcite , with the cusp - shaped structure characterized by two high - temperature ridges .",
    "this is similar to the double candle flame observed on 2014 january 27 ( flare no.6 in * ? ? ?",
    "the nls appears to cool down faster than the sls ( see temperature maps in figure [ fig : dem ] ) , which is natural since the latter hosts the main flaring region .",
    "the loops under stereoscopic reconstruction are visible in the 23 mk dem map at 01:40 ut .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that the nls s southern leg is both denser and hotter than the northern one ( figure [ fig : dem ] ) , reported by @xcite as a half loop .",
    "it was proposed that projection effects may cause certain asymmetry @xcite , but @xcite ruled out this effect because a ) the arcade axis is nearly parallel to the sdo s line of sight ( los ) and b ) the half - loop appearance is similar from orthogonal perspectives of sdo and sta .    noting that the sls does not exhibit asymmetry , we conjecture that what makes the difference is that the nls , which was ignited by the flare within the sls , is mostly regulated by chromospheric evaporation resulting from field - aligned heat conduction , while the sls , which hosts the nonthermal hxr emission ( figure[fig : rec](b ) ) , is dominated by precipitating particles .",
    "particle propagation is much less sensitive to the loop length than heat conduction , whose time scale is estimated as follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(16.4.4 ) ) , @xmath29 } ,   \\label{eq : time}\\ ] ] where the classical spitzer conductivity coefficient @xmath30 . taking the nls in figure[fig : dem ] for example",
    ", we estimated that @xmath31 @xmath32 with an los depth of @xmath012  mm , @xmath33 mk at the high - temperature ridge , and the half - loop length @xmath34 mm at 01:20 ut and 92 mm at 01:40 ut ( measured from the cusp point to the footpoint in 131 , see also the dotted curves in figure[fig : dem ] ) , which yields @xmath35 10 and 18 min , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 will increase further with the growth and cooling of the post - flare arcade .",
    "this may account for the noteworthy temperature gradient in the nls , i.e. , its hot ridges fail to reach down to the loop feet , in contrast to the sls ( see the temperature maps in figure[fig : dem ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the slipping motions are associated with an increase in the length ratio between the nls s northern and southern half loop . with the reconstructed 3d loops",
    ", we found that the ratio is 1.012 at 01:40 ut but increases to 1.186 at 02:25 ut ( figures  [ fig:3d ] ) , although the loop looks quite symmetric in the 2d projection of both 131 and 193 images ( figure[fig : rec](g ) and ( i ) ) .",
    "the enhanced ratio translates to a 37% increase in conduction time for the northern over southern half loop , given other parameters being fixed .",
    "this may make a significant difference when convolving the nonlinear complexity of chromospheric evaporation @xcite .",
    "we suspect that it is the similar case for the earlier hot loops undergoing slipping motions , manifested as the propagative dimming ( figure[fig : tempo](f ) and figure[fig : rec](c ) ) .",
    "moreover , the field lines traced from the hft footprint have an asymmetric shape in favor of this interpretation ( figure[fig : mag](a ) and ( d ) ) . consequently",
    ", one expects more sluggish conduction and therefore milder evaporation at the nls s northern leg than its southern counterpart , leading to the observed density and temperature asymmetry .",
    "to summarize , the 2011 january 28 m1.4 flare exhibits an interesting double candle flame underneath a larger cusp - shaped structure , which is associated with a locally tripolar magnetic configuration .",
    "each of the cusp - shaped structure is characterized by two high - temperature ridges , hotter than the arch - shaped flare loops underneath , as expected from the standard flare model",
    ". however , the apparent growth of the post - flare arcade observed face - on in sdo is associated with a zipper effect observed from above in sta , i.e. , the two far ends of the double candle flame are fixed , but their co - located central footpoints slip eastward . with the aid of the squashing factor @xmath17",
    "we demonstrate the presence of an hft separating the two adjacent flare loop systems . employing stereoscopic reconstruction technique",
    "we recognize that the footpoints of the post - flare loops slip along the central footprint of the hft , where the field lines are relatively flexible .",
    "we therefore conclude that the apparent slippage represents a continuous change of magnetic connectivities due to slipping magnetic reconnections at the hft .",
    "we further suggest that the intense euv late phase of this flare might have contribution from the slipping reconnections , and that the asymmetry observed in the northern candle flame could be attributed to milder chromospheric evaporation at its northern footpoint , which is farther away from the center of the hft , where the current concentration and dissipation is expected .",
    "a caveat of the interpretation regarding asymmetry is that it remains to be verified that the hot loops have a similar asymmetric shape and experience similar slipping motions as the cool loops .",
