    "coupled map lattices ( cml ) are arrays of low - dimensional dynamical systems with discrete time , originally introduced in 1984 as simple models for spatio - temporal complexity @xcite .",
    "cmls have been extensively used in modelling spatio - temporal chaos in fluids phenomena such as turbulence @xcite , convection @xcite and open flows @xcite .",
    "equally important is the analysis of pattern dynamics , which has found applications in chemistry @xcite and patch population dynamics @xcite .",
    "one important feature of pattern dynamics is the existence of travelling fronts , which occur at the pattern boundaries , and are also seen to emerge from apparently decorrelated media @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the work on the behaviour of a travelling interface on a lattice developed in @xcite .",
    "our main results are : @xmath0 a constructive procedure for the reduction of the infinitely - dimensional dynamics of a front to one dimension ; @xmath1 a characterization of the behaviour of fronts near the boundary of parametric stability ; @xmath2 a characterization of the behaviour of fronts near the continuum limit .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional infinite array of sites . at the @xmath3-th site",
    "there is a real dynamical variable @xmath4 , and a local dynamical system the _ local map_. the latter is given by a real function @xmath5 which we assume to be the same at all sites .",
    "the dynamics of the cml is a combination of local dynamics and coupling , which consists of a weighted sum over some neighbourhood .",
    "the time - evolution of the @xmath3-th variable is given by @xmath6 where the range of summation defines the neighbourhood .",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath7 are site - independent , and they satisfy the conservation law @xmath8 , to prevent unboundedness as time increases to infinity . the two most common choices for the coupling are @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are called _ one - way _ and _ diffusive _ cml , respectively .",
    "the diffusive cml corresponds to the discrete analogue of the reaction - diffusion equation with a symmetrical neighbouring interaction .",
    "there is now a single coupling parameter @xmath11 which is constrained by the inequality @xmath12 , to ensure that the sign of the coupling coefficients in ( [ diffu ] ) and ( [ one - way ] ) ( _ i.e. _  @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) remains positive .    in this paper",
    "we study front propagation in _",
    "bistable _ cmls .",
    "the local mapping @xmath5 is continuous and has two stable equilibria , and a _ front _ is any monotonic arrangement of the state variables , linking asymptotically the two equilibria .",
    "we will show how to construct a one - dimensional circle map describing the motion of the front .",
    "such a mapping originates from the existence of an invariant function describing the asymptotic front profile , and of a one - dimensional manifold supporting the transient motions",
    ". the rotation number of the circle map will then give the velocity of propagation , resulting in the occurrence of _ mode - locking _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the parametric stability of the configurations that correspond to _ rational _ velocity . we will describe the vanishing of this phenomenon in the continuum limit , as the width of the front becomes infinite .",
    "we shall also be concerned with the evolution of the front shape near the boundary of parametric stability , where the continuity of the local map ensures a smooth evolution of the front shape .",
    "velocity mode - locking is commonplace in nonlinear coupled systems ( _ e.g. _ , frenkel - kontorova models @xcite , josephson - junction arrays @xcite , excitable chemically reactions @xcite , and nonlinear oscillators @xcite ) : the present work provides further support for its genericity , and highlights key dynamical aspects .    throughout this paper , the very existence of fronts in the regimes of interest to us",
    "is inferred from extensive numerical evidence .",
    "we are not concerned with existence proofs here .",
    "fronts have been proved to exist in various situations , mainly for _ discontinuous _ piecewise affine maps ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; in the present context however , continuity is crucial .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a cml whose local map @xmath5 is continuous , monotonically increasing and which possesses exactly two stable fixed points @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it then follows that there exists a unique unstable fixed point @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "the homogeneous fixed states @xmath19 , @xmath20 , inherit the stability of the fixed points @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "a _ minimal mass state _ is a state satisfying the monotonicity condition @xmath27 , for all @xmath3 .",
    "it can be shown directly from the system equation that the image of a minimal mass state has the same property .",
    "a _ front _ is a minimal mass state satisfying the asymptotic condition : @xmath28 the main properties of a front are its _ centre of mass _ @xmath29 and its _ width _",
    "@xmath30 , which measure its position and spread at time @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "they are defined as the mean and variance of the variable @xmath3 with respect to the time - dependent probability distribution @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the variation of the local states .",
    "we have @xmath34 \\sigma_t^2 & = & \\ds\\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}{(i-\\mu_t)^2 p_t(i)}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] a state @xmath35 with finite centre of mass and width is said to be _",
    "localised_.    in this paper we are interested in fronts of _ fixed shape _ , moving at velocity @xmath36 .",
    "they are described by the equation @xmath37 here the function @xmath38=i$ ] is to be determined subject to the condition that it be monotonic , with @xmath39 .",
    "the degree of smoothness of @xmath40 will depend on the regime being considered .",
    "the object of interest to us is the central part of the front . far away from the centre ,",
    "the lattice is almost homogeneous ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath41 ) , and the dynamics is dominated by the attraction towards the stable points of the local map .",
    "the qualitative evolution of the centre of the front can be understood as the result of the competition between local dynamics and coupling ( see figure [ pulling.eps ] , for the one - way case ) . for small @xmath11 , the attraction towards the fixed points",
    "@xmath21 overcomes the effect of the coupling , resulting in propagation failure ( zero velocity ) @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently large coupling will instead cause a site located within the basin @xmath42 to switch to the basin @xmath43 , and move rapidly towards @xmath24 . as a consequence",
    ", the centre of mass of the front will move to the right , resulting in propagation .    a similar argument",
    "can be applied in the diffusive case .",
    "now however the coupling is symmetric , and a bias to either of the stable points will have to be introduced via an asymmetry in the local map .",
    "for instance , increasing the size of the basin of attraction of @xmath24 , will result in propagation from left to right for an increasing front .",
    "in previous works we have shown that the dynamics of a _ finite - size _ interface in a class of piece - wise linear one - way cmls can be reduced to a single one - dimensional map @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of the front depended on the existence of degenerate superstable fixed points of the local map , that caused nearby orbits to collapse unto the stable states in a single iteration . in this paper",
    "we remove such degeneracy , and consider smooth local maps and infinitely extended fronts ( the case of a discontinuous local map was treated in @xcite ) .",
    "we shall provide evidence that every front evolves towards a unique asymptotic regime , characterized by a constant velocity as well as an invariant shape . under these assumptions",
    ", we then show how the front behaves at the boundary of the regions of parametric stability ( here the continuity of the local map is essential ) , and how the reduction to one - dimensional dynamics can be achieved .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : continuum ] we describe the behaviour of travelling fronts in the continuum limit , when the density of interfacial sites is large .",
    "we obtain an ode describing the shape of the travelling front , and with it we find new classes of fronts . in section [ sec : reduced ] we consider the asymptotic shape of the front , and we provide extensive evidence that such a shape is fixed and is described by a continuous function .",
    "this result allows us to derive a procedure for the reduction of the infinite - dimensional interface dynamics to a one - dimensional problem described by the _ auxiliary map . _ in section [ sec : modloc ] we show that the auxiliary map is a circle map and we relate its rotation number to the velocity of the front , from which the mode - locking of the velocity with respect to the system parameters follows .",
    "finally , we explain in terms of reduced dynamics the vanishing effect of mode - locking when the continuum limit is approached .",
    "in this section we consider fronts with large widths , for which the relative density of sites is large , and the continuum approximation becomes appropriate . to achieve a front with such features , the attraction towards @xmath21 and",
    "the repulsion of @xmath17 must be small . because @xmath5 is continuous and monotonic , then @xmath5 is necessarily close to the identity , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44 choosing functions @xmath5 such that @xmath45 is referred to as the _ continuum limit_.    inserting equation ( [ eq : front ] ) into the equations of motion ( [ one - way ] ) and ( [ diffu ] ) we find that @xmath46 \\hbox{\\rm b ) } & h(z - v)&=&(1-\\e)f(h(z))\\\\[1.0ex ]               &        & & + \\ds{\\e\\over 2}\\left(f(h(z-1))+f(h(z+1))\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] for the one - way and diffusive cml , respectively , where @xmath47 .",
    "a function @xmath40 satisfying the functional equation ( [ functional ] ) represents the fixed shape of a front travelling at the velocity @xmath36 .    to solve equation ( [ functional ] ) in the continuum limit , we assume @xmath5 and @xmath40 to be twice differentiable , and consider the taylor series of @xmath40 in @xmath48 , up to second order .",
    "the taylor expansion becomes accurate as the width increases , since in this case the variation of @xmath40 over adjacent lattice sites tends to zero .",

    "we can further simplify equation ( [ taylor ] ) by considering @xmath52 and @xmath53 , to obtain @xmath54 \\hbox{\\rm b ) } &   h(z)-f(h(z ) ) - v\\,h'(z ) + \\ds      \\left({\\ds v^2-\\e\\over\\ds 2}\\right ) h''(z)=0 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] for the one - way and diffusive cml , respectively , where we set @xmath55 in the one - way case since in the continuum limit @xmath56 and thus the rate of information exchange ( _ i.e. _  the velocity ) is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "for the diffusive case the velocity is not equal to @xmath11 , since the total information exchange comes from the competition between the left and right neighbours . nevertheless , as we shall see , it is possible to give an analytical approximation to the velocity for the case of an asymmetric cubic local map .    equations ( [ odes ] ) are similar to those obtained in @xcite , where the travelling front in a lattice of coupled odes , is reduced to a single equation .",
    "the odes ( [ odes ] ) describe the motion of a particle of mass @xmath57 , subject to the potential @xmath58 , with maxima located at the stable fixed points of the local map ( figure [ pha-spa.eps ] ) .    in the one - way case ,",
    "the system is conservative . for numerical experiments ,",
    "we choose a symmetric local map @xmath5 with fixed point @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting potential is also symmetric .",
    "there exist two heteroclinic connections , joining @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and @xmath25 to @xmath24 , respectively ( the thick lines in figure [ pha-spa.eps](a ) ) .",
    "they correspond , respectively , to an increasing and a decreasing symmetric travelling front for the cml .    in the diffusive case , the differential equation has the dissipative term @xmath61 . for the local map ,",
    "we choose @xmath62 , which introduces an asymmetry in the system , and the maxima of the potential are now unequal : @xmath63 . imposing a heteroclinic connection from @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "constrains the velocity @xmath36 of the front ( see below ) . for larger velocities ,",
    "the separatrix emanating from @xmath24 approaches @xmath64 , while for smaller @xmath36 it escapes to infinity .",
    "since the presence of friction breaks the time - reversal symmetry , only one heteroclinic connection is possible , and the separatrix emanating from @xmath25 always approaches @xmath64 ( the thick lines in figure [ pha-spa.eps](b ) ) .",
    "the continuum approximation can be used to construct new kinds of travelling fronts .",
    "for example , the librating orbits in figure [ pha-spa.eps](a ) ( one - way case ) , correspond to spatially - periodic travelling fronts that never touch the stable points ( see figure [ waves.eps](a ) @xmath65 ) .",
    "such spatially - periodic orbits do not exist in the diffusive case .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to construct the travelling front departing from @xmath25 that dissipates down to @xmath64 .",
    "this new solution has a damped oscillatory profile ( see figure [ waves.eps](b ) @xmath66 ) , and it is unstable , because the fixed point at @xmath64 is unstable ( for the cml ) .    in the remainder of this section , we briefly examine the case of a cubic local map , providing the dominant behaviour of a general bistable local map in the continuum limit .",
    "we use the one - parameter families of cubics @xmath67 \\hbox{\\rm b ) } & f(x)=(1-\\nu)\\,(p\\,x^2-x^3 -p)+(2-\\nu)\\,x . \\end{array}\\ ] ] for the one - way and diffusive cml , respectively .",
    "again , @xmath68 for both cases , while @xmath60 in the one - way case and @xmath69 in the diffusive case , where @xmath70 controls the asymmetry .",
    "the continuum limit is attained by letting the parameter @xmath71 approach 1 from below .",
    "substituting the cubic local maps ( [ cubics ] ) in the differential equations ( [ odes ] ) , one finds expressions for the heteroclinic connections corresponding to the travelling front solutions : @xmath72 \\hbox{\\rm b ) } & h(z ) = \\tanh\\left({\\ds(1-\\nu)p \\over\\ds v}\\,z\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 \\hbox{\\rm b ) } & v= p\\sqrt{\\e(1-\\nu ) } & \\quad\\ds \\sigma^2 = { \\pi^2\\over 3}{\\e \\over 1-\\nu}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] for the one - way and diffusive cml , respectively . in the diffusive case ,",
    "the expression for the velocity is derived from imposing an heteroclinic connection , while the scaling of the width @xmath74 is found from the solutions ( [ wave - sol ] ) .",
    "note that for both models the functional dependence of the width on the parameter @xmath71 is the same , and it describes the rate at which the front broadens as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "moreover , from ( [ wave - sol ] ) and ( [ width ] ) we have that in the diffusive case @xmath40 is independent of @xmath64 .    while in the continuum",
    "limit the front is described by a continuous function @xmath40 ( _ cf .",
    "_  equations ( [ wave - sol ] ) ) , there is no _ a - priori _ reason why such a function should continue to exist away from the limit , due to the discrete nature of the system .",
    "we shall nonetheless give evidence that the dynamics of a front far from the continuous limit remains one - dimensional .",
    "in this section we provide evidence that every front has a fixed profile , which can be characterized by an invariant function @xmath40 . such a function",
    "will then be used to construct a one - dimensional mapping describing the front evolution the _ auxiliary map_.    if the velocity @xmath36 of the front is _ irrational _ , then the collection of points @xmath75 , with @xmath3 and @xmath31 integers , form a set dense on the real line .",
    "numerical experiments consistently suggest that in the case of a front , the closure of the set of points @xmath76 forms the graph of a continuous and monotonic function : @xmath77 $ ] , which is a solution to the functional equation ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "the results for both cml models are summarised in figure [ sftg.ps ] , where we have superposed all translates of the discrete fronts , after eliminating transient behaviour .",
    "this procedure requires computing @xmath36 numerically , which was done using some @xmath78@xmath79 iterations of the cml .",
    "( in principle , a numerical solution to ( [ functional ] ) can be found using various iterative functional schemes .",
    "however , all the schemes considered were plagued by slow convergence and are not discussed here . )    in the case in which @xmath80 is _ rational _ , the function @xmath40 is specified only at a set of @xmath81 equally spaced points .",
    "it turns out , however , that the definition of @xmath40 becomes unequivocal in a prominent parametric regime , corresponding to the boundary of the so - called mode - locking region or _",
    "tongue_. the latter is defined as the collection of parameters @xmath82 corresponding to a given rational velocity , where @xmath71 ( not necessarily one - dimensional ) parametrizes the family of local maps for the one - way cml we typically use @xmath83 .",
    "we defer the discussion of the origin of such regions to the next section . here",
    "we consider a sequence of parameters @xmath84 , converging from the outside towards a boundary point @xmath85 of the tongue ( see figure [ boundary.ps ] ) . independently from the path chosen to approach the boundary point , the front @xmath40 appears to approach a unique limiting shape .",
    "the limiting shape is a step function with @xmath81 steps ( where @xmath80 ) for every unit length the horizontal length of each step is @xmath86 since there are @xmath81 equidistant points in every horizontal interval of unit length for a @xmath80 orbit . in the limit ,",
    "the front dynamics becomes periodic , with periodic points corresponding to the midpoint of each step .",
    "this observation suggests that choosing step fronts with the periodic points at their midpoints ensures continuity of the front shapes at the resonance tongue boundaries .    in the next section",
    ", we shall explain this phenomenon in terms of the dynamics of a one - dimensional map the _ auxiliary map _",
    "@xmath87 which we now define .",
    "the idea is to describe the evolution of any site in the front by means of a single site , the _ central site _",
    "@xmath88 , defined as the site which is closest to the unstable point @xmath17 .",
    "the position of the central site moves along the lattice with an average velocity @xmath89 , since it follows the centre of the interface .",
    "following @xcite , we define the map @xmath87 as @xmath90 if the velocity is _ irrational _ , the domain of definition of the map is a set of points dense in an interval ( see next section ) , and the possibility exists of extending @xmath87 continuously to the interval . in figure [ auxmap1g.ps](a ) and",
    "( b ) , we plot the graph of @xmath87 for a one - way and a diffusive cml , respectively .",
    "the auxiliary map corresponds to the square region depicted with thick lines , while the other regions represent delay poincar maps of some neighbouring sites .",
    "indeed for each neighbour @xmath91 of the central site , there is a corresponding auxiliary circle map @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 , with @xmath94 ( see below ) .",
    "if the velocity is _ rational _ , equation ( [ eq : auxiliarymap ] ) defines @xmath87 only at a finite set of points , and to extend the domain of definition , one must make use of equation ( [ eq : auxiliarymap ] ) on suitable transients .",
    "we have verified numerically that when a front is perturbed , the perturbation relaxes quickly onto a one - dimensional manifold , along which the original front is approached . the process of randomly disturbing the front amounts to a random walk path reconstruction of the one - dimensional manifold .",
    "such one - dimensional transients were found to be independent of the detail of the perturbation , giving a unequivocal definition of the auxiliary map also in the rational case .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ auxmaptongueg.ps ] .",
    "crucially , this construction yields a map that changes continuously within the tongue , matching the the behaviour at the boundary of the tongue .",
    "thus we conjecture that the auxiliary map @xmath87 depends continuously on the coupling parameter @xmath11 . in the next section",
    "we shall explore some consequences of the continuity .",
    "we finally relate the dynamics of the entire front to that of the central site , governed by @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the @xmath91-th neighbouring site of the central site @xmath88 , where @xmath91 is positive ( negative ) for the right ( left ) neighbours .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath96 can be deduced from that of @xmath88 and the knowledge of @xmath40 , as follows @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the translation by @xmath91 on @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 maps @xmath96 to @xmath101 , the pair @xmath102 belongs to the graph of @xmath92 . by applying the operator @xmath103 to the function",
    "@xmath104 we obtain : @xmath105 & = & \\bar x_{t+1}(j ) \\,=\\ , \\phi_j\\left(\\bar x_t(j)\\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where we used equation ( [ hh-1 ] ) which relates neighbouring sites .",
    "thus @xmath106 provides a conjugacy between @xmath87 and @xmath92 and enables us to reconstruct the whole interfacial dynamics from the behaviour of the central site .",
    "in this section we show that the auxiliary map @xmath87 is a circle homeomorphism ( see figure [ circle.eps ] ) .",
    "the mode - locking of the front velocity will then follow from the mode - locking of the rotation number of @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the conjectured continuous dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath11 implies a continuous dependence of the rotation number on @xmath11 , and in particular , @xmath87 takes all rotation numbers between any two realised values .",
    "for instance , the front velocity in a one - way cml takes the values @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath108 , respectively , and thus as the coupling parameter varies , all velocities @xmath110 $ ] are realised . for a diffusive cml",
    "only an interval @xmath111 $ ] is attained since the maximum velocity @xmath112 does not reach 1 because of the competition between the attractors .",
    "let us consider a continuous and increasing travelling front @xmath113 with positive irrational velocity @xmath114 .",
    "the largest possible separation between @xmath88 and @xmath17 corresponds to the position of @xmath40 for which two consecutive points on the lattice are equally spaced from the unstable point @xmath17 .",
    "suppose that the front shape @xmath40 is positioned such that for site @xmath3 , we have @xmath115 . we choose @xmath116 such that @xmath117 where @xmath118 . by adding the two equations in ( [ h_alpha ] ) one obtains an equation for @xmath116 , and @xmath119",
    "can then be evaluated .",
    "if the front is at a position where it satisfies the equations ( [ h_alpha ] ) for some @xmath3 , then the @xmath3-th and @xmath120-th sites are equally spaced from @xmath17 , and the dynamics of the site closest to @xmath17 is contained in the interval @xmath121 $ ] .",

    "these symbols corresponds to the central site @xmath4 remaining unchanged , or being replaced by the new site @xmath144 , respectively .    every time a ` 1 ' is encountered , the front advances by roughly one site .",

    "moreover , the periodic orbit will form towards the centre of the dark bands and the corresponding front shape will `` flatten '' at the heights taken by the periodic points because of the time spent in their neighbourhood by the orbits of @xmath87 for @xmath155 .",
    "it then follows that the approximating fronts will form steps for the periodic front with the periodic points close to their centre points , and independently from the parametric path chosen to approach the boundary point ( see figure [ boundary.ps ] ) .",
    "in figure [ tongues.eps ] we plot the main mode - locking regions in parameter space ( arnold tongues ) , corresponding to @xmath80 with small @xmath81 . here",
    "the local map is given by @xmath83 , while the parameters vary within the unit square : @xmath156 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we believe that mode - locking is a common phenomenon in front propagation in cmls , because the nonlinearity of the local map induces nonlinearity in the auxiliary map @xcite , and mode - locking is generic for such maps .",
    "however , this phenomenon often takes place on very small parametric scales , since the width of the tongues decreases sharply with increasing @xmath71 ( figure [ tongues.eps ] ) .",
    "this explains why this phenomenon has not been widely reported ( with the notable exception of the large @xmath157 region , corresponding to the well - known propagation failure in the anti - continuum limit @xcite ) .",
    "in the continuum limit ( see figure [ tongues.eps ] ) , the stability of the attractors @xmath21 becomes weaker , causing the front to broaden . in figure",
    "[ auxmapcontinuumg.ps ] we plotted the auxiliary maps @xmath150 corresponding to @xmath158 for the one - way cml with local map @xmath83 .",
    "this figure should be compared with figure [ auxmap1g.ps ] , corresponding to a narrower front .",
    "the domain of each @xmath150 is now smaller , since the interval @xmath159 $ ] has to be shared between a larger number of sites . as a consequence ,",
    "the nonlinearity of each @xmath87 is reduced ( note that the auxiliary maps in figure [ auxmapcontinuumg.ps ] are almost linear ) and with it the size of the tongues .",
    "thus , the larger the width @xmath74 of the travelling front , the thinner the mode - locking tongue ( see right hand side scale in figure [ tongues.eps ] ) .",
