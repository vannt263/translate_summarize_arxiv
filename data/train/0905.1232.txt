    "the @xmath0 resonance mode observed by neutron scattering in the cuparte superconductors is among the most prominent phenomena in these systems@xcite . below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1",
    ", a sharp peak is observed in the spin fluctuation spectrum around @xmath0 .",
    "the mode is found to have close correlation with superconductivity of the system .",
    "for example , the mode energy , which is temperature independent , is found to scale linearly with @xmath1 as a function of doping . at the same time , the intensity of the mode is found to have the similar temperature dependence as the superfluid density .",
    "much theoretical efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the origin of the neutron resonance mode and its correlation with superconductivity@xcite . among these theories ,",
    "the rpa - like theory , which takes the resonance mode as a spin - one bound state in the particle - hole channel(spin exciton ) induced by the residual attractive interaction between the bogliubov quasiparticles in the superconducting state , is the most popular . in this theory ,",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility is given by @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the bare spin susceptibility of the bcs superconducting state determined by both the band dispersion and the gap function .",
    "@xmath4 is the phenomenological rpa correction factor chosen to fit the experimental data . in the rpa theory ,",
    "the superconducting gap sets a natural energy scale for the resonance mode below which the mode is stable . at the same time , when the system approaches the antiferromagnetic ordering instability under rpa correction , the mode will evolve into the goldstone mode of the ordered state and its energy will approach zero .",
    "thus , the energy of the resonance mode in the rpa theory is determined by both the magnitude of the superconducting gap and the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlation .",
    "although the rpa theory can account for some aspects of the neutron resonance mode , it is at the best , a phenomenological theory .",
    "the band dispersion of the quasiparticle and the rpa correction factor @xmath4 , on which the result of rpa calculation depends sensitively on , are subjected to fine tuning .",
    "an effort to combine the more microscopic slave boson mean field theory and the rpa theory in the @xmath5 model@xcite has resulted in too large a doping range(@xmath6 , @xmath7 is doping concentration ) in which the system is unstable with respect to antiferromagnetic ordering . at the same time , neither the phenomenological rpa theory nor the rpa correction on the slave boson mean field theory of the @xmath5 model respects the local spin sum rule of the @xmath5 model , @xmath8 , as a result of their neglect of the no double occupancy constraint of the @xmath5 model .    in this paper , we propose a variational description for the neutron resonance mode with a gutzwiller projected wave function .",
    "our approach can be taken as the generalization of the usual rpa theory into the hilbert space satisfying the no double occupancy constraint of the @xmath5 model .",
    "the approach has the virtual that it is parameter free : the rpa correction is automatically done through the variational procedure .",
    "we also devise an efficient algorithm to do monte carlo simulation on the variational wave function we proposed .",
    "numerical calculation shows that our variational description of the neutron resonance mode capture its basic characteristics very well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the variational ground state and present the result of the single mode approximation on which the result of our variational calculation would compare to .",
    "we then introduce our variational wave function for the neutron resonance mode and the numerical technique to do monte carlo simulation on it",
    ". then we present our numerical results and offer a discussion on the results .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper with some further problems to be addressed in the future .",
    "we take the @xmath5 model as the basic model to describe the physics of high-@xmath1 superconductors @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the constrained electron operator satisfying the constraint @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the sum over nearest neighboring(nn ) and next nearest neighboring(nnn ) sites . here",
    "we take @xmath14 to describe hole doped system .",
    "the exchange term is fixed at @xmath15 .",
    "the no double occupancy constraint @xmath11 is crucial for the spin dynamics of the system . with this constraint ,",
    "the electron behave like mobile @xmath16 spin rather than usual free electron .",
    "more quantitatively , the spin structure factor in the @xmath5 model satisfies the following local spin sum rule @xmath17 in any physical state , here @xmath7 is hole density .",
    "when the constraint is relaxed , as is done in slave boson mean field theory or phenomenological rpa theory , the spin fluctuation would be strongly suppressed and no such sum rule would apply .    to satisfy the local spin sum rule of the @xmath5 model , the variational ground state , on which to construct the variational excitations , must respect the no double occupancy constraint .",
    "the gutzwiller projected d - wave bcs state@xcite , which satisfy the no double occupancy constraint and for long has been known as an excellent variational description of the ground state of the system , is the most natural choice for this purpose .",
    "thus our variational ground state is given by @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the projection operator into the subspace with @xmath20 electrons and @xmath21 is the gutzwiller projection operator into the subspace of no double occupancy , @xmath22 is the real space wave function of the cooper pair with @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "are given by @xmath27 in which @xmath28 are variational parameters to be determined by the optimization of the ground state energy with respect to the @xmath5 model .",
    "we note @xmath28 are just variational parameters , rather than real nnn hoping term , real chemical potential and real superconducting gap .",
    "now we construct the spin excitation on the variational ground state . as a first approximation to @xmath0 resonance mode",
    ", we adopt the single mode approximation of the form @xmath29 is the creation operator of the spin density excitation at @xmath30 . as the variational ground state satisfy the no double occupancy constraint , the spin excitation spectrum is guaranteed to obey the local spin sum rule .",
    "the single mode approximation is a good approximation when the spin fluctuation spectrum is dominated by the contribution form the resonance mode .",
    "the excitation energy in the single mode approximation can be calculated in the standard way @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the ground state energy .",
    "assuming that @xmath33 , we have @xmath34|\\psi_{g}\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi_{g}|s_{q}^{-}s_{q}^{+}|\\psi_{g}\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the commutation relation @xmath35&=&-\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\downarrow}\\hat{c}_{i,\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\nonumber \\\\\\ [ \\hat{c}_{i,\\sigma},s_{j}^{+}]&=&\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\uparrow}\\hat{c}_{i,\\downarrow},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath36 is the constrained electron creation operator at site @xmath37 and @xmath38 is spin lifting operator at site @xmath39 , the mode energy in the single mode approximation can be shown to be given by @xmath40 it is interesting to note that the @xmath41 term of the hamiltonian does not contribute when @xmath30 .    the mode energy calculated from eq.(10 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "two things are to be noted here .",
    "first , @xmath42 increases monotonically with doping , consistent with observation in the underdoped regime .",
    "second , @xmath42 approaches zero at half filling in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath42 is due to the rapid decrease of the spin structure factor as a function of doping which overcompensates the increase of the absolute value of the kinetic energy and the exchange energy .",
    "the second is in fact a reflection of the goldstone theorem . at half filling , the spin structure factor calculated from @xmath43 scales superlinearly with the number of lattice site @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) as a result of the long range correlation induced by the gutzwiller projection@xcite .",
    "however , the kinetic and exchange energy is by definition proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "thus @xmath42 must approach zero at half filling as @xmath46 .",
    "this is to be compared with the mean field prediction that @xmath47 at all doping which imply that @xmath42 remains finite even at half filling .",
    "thus the gutzwiller projection in our wave function plays a key role to recover the correct trend of the mode energy as a function of doping .",
    "the mode energy calculated by the single mode approximation is in fact the center of gravity of the spin fluctuation spectrum at @xmath30 and thus overestimates the energy of the resonance mode which lies at the bottom of the spin fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in fact , the single mode approximation we adopted above has nothing to say about the very existence of the resonance mode .",
    "this is especially clear at large doping when the mode energy predicted by eq.(10 ) stretches into the particle - hole continuum .",
    "thus , although the single mode approximation gives correctly the trend of the mode energy as a function of doping , it is too crude to give a quantitative answer on both the mode energy and mode weight .",
    "it should be noted that the energy calculated from eq.(10 ) with the variational ground state is only a approximation to the single mode approximation energy(as we have made the assumption that @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , although eq.(10 ) is by definition positive definite , the true single mode approximation energy can be negative when the system become unstable with respect to magnetic ordering at @xmath30 .",
    "we will encounter this situation below when we calculate the single mode approximation energy directly from eq.(7 ) .",
    "( divided by the number of lattice sites,@xmath44 ) as a function of doping.,width=302 ]",
    "in the rpa theory , the resonance mode is interpreted as a spin exciton : a spin - one particle - hole bound state below the superconducting gap induced by the residual interaction between the bogliubov quasiparticles .",
    "the wave function for the spin exciton can be generally written as @xmath48 describe the relative motion of the two quasiparticles @xmath49 and @xmath50 within the bound state .",
    "@xmath51 denotes the bcs mean field ground state and @xmath49 denotes the creation operator for the bogliubov quasiparticles .",
    "as we have shown , the mean field state fails to satisfy the local spin sum rule .",
    "for this reason , we project the spin exciton wave function eq.(11 ) into the subspace of no double occupancy to construct a variational wave function for the resonance mode , with @xmath52 as the variational parameter to be determined by optimization of energy .",
    "@xmath53 we note that the wave function of the single mode approximation can also be cast into the form of eq.(12 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath54 in which @xmath55 . here",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath56 commute with both @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "the variational parameters @xmath52 can be determined by minimizing the energy of @xmath57 with respect to the @xmath5 hamiltonian .",
    "the variational energy is given by @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the matrix element of the @xmath5 hamiltonian in the basis @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the overlap integral between these non - orthogonal basis function(note that @xmath62 form a orthogonal basis set before the gutzwiller projection ) .",
    "the problem of minimizing @xmath42 respect to the set of variational parameters @xmath52 now reduces to solving the following generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath63 it is easily seen that the optimized energy @xmath42 is given by the lowest eigenvalue @xmath64 of the above generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the above optimization procedure can also be interpreted as re - diagonalizing the @xmath5 hamiltonian in the subspace spanned by the set of non - orthogonal basis function @xmath60 . with this understanding in mind",
    ", we can even construct variationally the full spin fluctuation spectrum as follows @xmath65 in which @xmath66 denotes the n - th eigenvector of the generalized eigenvalue problem with the eigenvalue @xmath67 , @xmath32 denotes the variational ground state energy(here we assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are so chosen that both @xmath57 and @xmath70 are normalized ) . as @xmath66 forms a orthonormal basis with respect to the overlap matrix @xmath71 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 in which we have used the fact that @xmath74 which can be derived from the orthonormality of the eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue problem eq.(18 ) , @xmath75 thus our variational construction of the spin fluctuation spectrum respects the local spin sum rule of the @xmath5 model .",
    "our variational scheme for the resonance mode has the advantage that it involves no tunable parameter : the parameters in @xmath43 is determined by optimizing the ground state energy and the spin exciton wave function @xmath52 is determined by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the rpa correction is thus automatically taken into account in our formalism .    from the above discussion ,",
    "we know the single mode approximation can be taken as a special case of the projected spin exciton wave function(with @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus by construction , the resonance energy calculated from eq.(18 ) should be lower than that calculated from single mode approximation .",
    "in fact , the mode energy calculated from the single mode approximation gives the center of gravity of the spin fluctuation spectrum , while the resonance mode lies at the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "as the single mode approximation already reproduces the correct trend for the mode energy as a function of doping in the underdoped regime , we can even expect our variational scheme to produce quantitatively reasonable result .",
    "to calculate the energy of the resonance mode , we should first evaluate the matrix element of the hamiltonian in the set of strongly correlated basis functions @xmath60 , @xmath77 and the overlap matrix element @xmath71 .",
    "this can be done in principle by the variational monte carlo(vmc ) method .",
    "for example , to evaluate @xmath78 , we first expand @xmath60 in an orthogonal basis @xmath79 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 is the wave function of @xmath60 in this basis .",
    "then we have @xmath81 in which @xmath82",
    "then we sample the basis space @xmath79 with the weight @xmath83 and do the sum with the standard vmc technique@xcite .",
    "the above procedure , though straightforward , is very inefficient . in our problem , there are @xmath84 hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath84 overlap matrix elements @xmath71 to be evaluated .",
    "for lattice of reasonable size , say , @xmath85 , the number of the matrix elements to be evaluated would exceed 40000 even take into account the hermitian property of @xmath77 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is very time consuming . at the same time",
    ", the naive approach has the drawback that it involves large statistical error in the simulation .",
    "this can be seen as follows , @xmath86 thus , when the node of @xmath87 and @xmath88 do not coincide with each other , we will run into trouble when we sample @xmath87 around its node as the fluctuation of @xmath89 becomes large .",
    "a way to reduce the statistical error caused by the fluctuation of @xmath89 is to sample the combined weight @xmath90 rather than @xmath83 , @xmath91 now the calculation of @xmath92 can be done as @xmath93 the combined weight samples symmetrically between @xmath87 and @xmath88 and avoids the fluctuation caused by their uncommon nodes .",
    "thus the statistical error is much reduced .",
    "the above technique can be easily generalized to calculate all the @xmath84 overlap matrix elements @xmath71 .",
    "here we sample the combined weight of all the @xmath44 @xmath83 : @xmath94 .",
    "the calculation is done as follows : @xmath95 to sample @xmath96 , we note that @xmath97 and @xmath98 in which @xmath99 is one basis function arbitrarily chosen from the @xmath44 basis functions . from this transformation , we see all we need to calculate in order to evaluate @xmath100 is the @xmath44 ratio between basis functions @xmath101 . as the different basis functions are all slater determinant differing with each other by at most in a pair of quasiparticle excitations , such ratio is easy to calculate using the inverse updating technique for fermion determinant .",
    "more importantly , the calculation of all the @xmath84 overlap matrix elements can be done in a single monte carlo simulation : the algorithm is highly parallelized .",
    "the calculation of the hamiltonian matrix elements can be done similarly .",
    "we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "following the same reasoning , we arrive at @xmath104 thus the calculation of the hamiltonian matrix elements involves the evaluation of the ratio @xmath105 .",
    "the calculation of this ratio , though numerically more demanding , is still highly parallelized .",
    "thus the re - weighting technique developed here not only reduce considerably the statistical error involved in the monte carlo simulation , but also highly parallelize the calculation of the overlap and hamiltonian matrix elements , reducing their calculation from the order of @xmath84 to a single monte carlo simulation .",
    "to calculate the energy of the neutron resonance mode , we first optimize the variational parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 as a function of doping for the ground state .",
    "the calculation is done on a @xmath85 lattice with periodic - antiperiodic boundary condition .",
    "we choose @xmath15 and @xmath14 in the @xmath5 model to describe a hole doped cuprate .",
    "the results of the optimized variational parameters as a function of doping are shown in fig.2 and fig.3 .             as a function of excitation energy and doping determined from the variational calculation .",
    "the calculation is done on a @xmath85 lattice .",
    "the delta function peaks of the spectrum are broadened into lorentzian peaks with a width of @xmath109 .",
    ", width=226 ]    we note the superconducting region determined by the variational approach for the @xmath5 model is considerably larger than that observed in experiments . in fig.3 , we plot the off diagonal long range order(odlro ) calculated from the optimized variational ground state .",
    "the odlro is defined as @xmath110 in which @xmath111 is the cooper pair annihilation operator at site @xmath37 , @xmath112 is the largest distance on the finite lattice .",
    "we find the odlro reaches its maximal around @xmath113 .",
    "we will take this doping concentration as an estimate of the location of the optimal doping in the following discussion .",
    "after obtaining the variational parameters of the ground state we are now ready to calculate the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath77 and the overlap matrix elements @xmath71 .",
    "this is the most heavy part of our numerical calculation . in our calculation , we have sampled more than two and a half million configurations with the weight @xmath96 .",
    "the accept ratio is tuned to be @xmath114 .",
    "the statistical error is found to be smaller than the fluctuation caused by the finite size effect in our calculation .",
    "when we get the matrix elements @xmath77 and @xmath71 , we solve the generalized eigenvalue problem eq.(18 ) and calculate the physical quantities that we are interested in .",
    "first we show the spin fluctuation spectrum calculated in this variational approach in fig.4 .",
    "we see the spectrum consists of both a coherent peak and a continuum of incoherent spin fluctuation .",
    "the coherent peak at the bottom of the spectrum is nothing but the neutron resonance mode in our variational description .",
    "fig.5 shows the mode energy as a function of doping .",
    "we find the mode energy becomes negative below a critical doping around @xmath115 .",
    "a negative excitation energy indicates magnetic instability of the system .",
    "the critical doping so determined is close but sightly lower than that determined by assuming directly a magnetic order in the variational ground state , which is about @xmath116@xcite . in whole doping range",
    "in which the mode has nonzero spectral weight , the mode energy is a monotonically increasing function of doping and reaches about @xmath117 before it loses its weight and merges into the particle - hole continuum at about @xmath118 .",
    "if we take @xmath119 as is usually done in the literature , we get the maximum of the mode energy to be about @xmath120 , about a factor of 1.8 larger than that observed in optimally doped @xmath121@xcite .        in our theory , the mode energy increases monotonically with doping .",
    "this is consistent with experiments in the underdoped regime but may have inconsistency with experiment in the overdoped regime , where experiment reported evidence of a weak resonance mode with an energy sightly lower than that of the optimally doped system@xcite .",
    "if we take the doping at which the odlro reaches maximum(@xmath122 ) as the optimal doping , then the resonance mode will survive in the slightly overdoped regime with an energy higher than that of the optimal doped system .",
    "the would imply a breakdown of the linear scaling between the mode energy and @xmath1 in the slightly overdoped regime .",
    "fig.6 shows the relative and absolute spectral weight of the resonance mode calculated from our theory .",
    "the relative spectral weight is defined as the proportion of the mode intensity to the total spectral weight at @xmath30 , @xmath123 the absolute spectral weight is defined as the product of the relative spectral weight and the spin structure factor divided by @xmath44 .",
    "the absolute spectral weight decreases rapidly with doping as a result of the decrease of both the magnetic structure factor and the relative spectral weight . the relative spectral weight of the resonance mode decrease from unity at half filling down to zero at about @xmath118 .",
    "the unity of the relative spectral weight come from the long range correlation of spin at half filling and indicates that the resonance mode can be connected smoothly to the goldstone mode in the magnetic ordered state .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a variational theory for the neutron resonance mode in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "our theory has the virtue that it involves no free parameter and thus has much larger predictive power than the phenomenological rpa treatment of the spin fluctuation . in our theory , the rpa correction is automatically taken into account by the variational procedure which reduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "more importantly , our variational approach builds in the no double occupancy constraint and thus satisfies the local spin sum rule of the @xmath5 model .",
    "this is of vital importance for a correct description of the spin dynamics of cuprates .",
    "our approach has the further advantage that it provides a physical transparent understanding of the resonance mode as a spin exciton in the physical subspace of no double occupancy .",
    "our approach can also be taken as diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a truncated subspace with the same quantum number as the excitation discussed and can be used to calculate the full spectrum rather than the coherent excitation only .",
    "it is important to note this truncated subspace exhaust the spectral weight for the relevant sum rule , indicating the relevance of the spectrum calculated in this way .",
    "an effort to apply the current approach to calculate the spin fluctuation spectrum at momentum other than @xmath0 , namely the incommensurate spin fluctuation spectrum , is now under investigation .",
    "we have also devised a very efficient re - weighting technique to tackle the numerical problem of simulating the variational wave function composed of n linearly superposed slater determinants .",
    "the key for the efficiency of the algorithm is the observation that the slater determinants involved in our wave function differ with each other by at most a pair of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "obviously this technique can be applied in a much larger literature than simulating the physics of cuprates .    as we have found in the single mode approximation ,",
    "the center of gravity of the spin fluctuation spectrum increases monotonically with doping as a result of the rapid decrease of the spin structure factor at @xmath30 .",
    "we find the resonance mode , which lies at the bottom of the spin fluctuation spectrum , inherits this monotonic behavior , probably for the same reason . as we have mentioned above , this may have potential conflict with the report of weak resonance mode in the overdoped sample with an energy lower than that of the optimal doped system@xcite and would imply the breakdown of the @xmath124 linear scaling in the overdoped regime .",
    "in our theory , the monotonic increase of the mode energy eventually cut off at about twice the maximal superconducting gap when the mode transfers all of its weight into the particle - hole continuum . to exhibit a non - monotonic behavior before merging into the particle - hole continuum ,",
    "it is necessary for the superconducting gap to decrease faster with doping than that predicted by the present variational calculation .",
    "this is not at all impossible .",
    "however , since there is no generally reason to believe the @xmath124 linear scaling to hold in the overdoped regime and the mode weight become very small in the overdoped regime , we think the mode energy in the overdoped regime is a problem subjected to fine - tuning .    the mode energy at the optimal doping(@xmath122 )",
    "as calculated from our approach is about @xmath117 and is a factor of 1.8 larger than that observed in optimally doped @xmath121 . at the same time , the variational theory predicts a considerably larger value of optimal doping than observed in experiments(@xmath125 ) .",
    "it is likely that these two problems and the problem of the @xmath124 linear scaling to hold in the overdoped regime are related with each other .",
    "however , it is not clear to what extend should we attribute these disagreements with experiment solely to the limitation of the variational approach we have adopted rather than the intrinsic properties of the @xmath5 model .",
    "finally , we discuss the relation between the resonance mode and the superconductivity . as many other theories of the resonance mode@xcite",
    ", our theory also predicts that the resonance mode becomes stronger and stronger with decreasing doping and evolves smoothly into the goldstone mode of the ordered state at half filling . on the other hand , in the phenomenological so(5 ) theory of cuprates@xcite , in which the mode is understood as a pseudo - goldstone mode accompanying breaking of an so(5 ) symmetry between the d - wave superconducting order and the antiferromagnetic order ,",
    "the mode intensity is predicted to be proportional to the off diagonal long range order(odlro ) of the system .",
    "thus the theory predicts that the mode intensity should decrease when we increase temperature or decrease doping and disappear out of the superconducting dome . on the experimental side ,",
    "the resonance mode is observed to loss weight with increasing temperature and to disappear in the normal state at optimal doping . in slightly underdoped sample ,",
    "a broadened and weak signal is observed above @xmath1 . with further decrease of doping ,",
    "the normal state signal becomes stronger and stronger and the enhancement due to superconductivity becomes less and less prominent@xcite .    in our theory , we only consider the zero temperature case . at finite temperature , both quasiparticle excitations and collective fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter",
    "will be thermally excited .",
    "the latter excitation is believed to be especially important around the superconducting transition point .",
    "we believe both of these thermal excitations are responsible for the decrease of the mode intensity with increasing temperature .",
    "the doping dependence of the mode intensity is more subtle . here",
    "the relevant question is why the superconductivity - related enhancement of the mode intensity becomes smaller and smaller with decreasing doping . in the very underdoped regime ,",
    "the electron correlation(mott physics)is greatly enhanced .",
    "we believe the mott physics is at work in reducing the superconductivity - related enhancement of the mode intensity in the very underdoped regime .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the rvb picture , the electron correlation effect manifests itself as quantum fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter .    in all , apart from some subtle issues mentioned above , our variational approach capture the gross feature of the neutron resonance mode and provides the first truly microscopic understanding of this important phenomena in the high - temperature superconductors .",
    "as a by product of this research , we developed a very efficient re - weighting technique to simulated wave function composed of n linearly superposed slater determinants , an algorithm whose potential application is obviously far beyond the high - tc issue ."
