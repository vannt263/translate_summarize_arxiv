    "recent high precision measurements on type ia supernovae ( snia ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and rich galaxy clusters indicate that our universe is well described by a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model with mass energy density @xmath2 and dark energy density @xmath3 @xcite . however , our knowledge of the nature of the dark energy is still limited , amounting to the facts that it is smooth on small scales and has negative pressure , therefore causing the universe to accelerate . the most famous dark energy model which meets these two requirements is vacuum energy due to the cosmological constant @xmath4 , but",
    "equally well - known are the many problems associated with its introduction @xcite .",
    "a fairly recent alternative to @xmath4 is quintessence , which resembles inflation in that it introduces a new scalar field @xmath5 to account for the dark energy .",
    "consequently , the equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 is in general time - varying , whereas @xmath7 always . at the present epoch",
    ", the field sits still or rolls slowly down its potential which results in a negative equation of state , i.e. negative pressure .",
    "a key feature of many quintessence models is that the equations of motion have attractor - like solutions , which ensures that a wide range of initial conditions give the same late - time evolution of the field .",
    "although this behaviour solves one of the fine - tuning problems of the cosmological constant , the tuning of initial conditions , it does not answer the question why @xmath8 today @xcite .    the prospects of using the proposed supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) @xcite , a two - meter satellite telescope dedicated to the search and follow - up of supernovae , as a tool to probe the nature of dark energy has been examined in several papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for example , goliath et al . show that given an independent high - precision measurement of @xmath9 , snap can constrain the parameters of a linear equation of state @xmath10 to within @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively at the one - sigma level , assuming a flat universe .",
    "moreover , weller & albrecht conclude that snap will be able to distinguish some quintessence models from a pure cosmological constant . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility to differentiate between different parameters in one and the same potential . as our data",
    "we will use simulated snia magnitude - redshift measurements corresponding to one year of snap data and 300 events from low-@xmath0 supernova searches such as the snfactory @xcite .",
    "one of the most common quintessence models in the literature is the simple inverse power - law potential introduced by ratra and peebles @xcite and reanalysed by steinhardt et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a mass parameter which is fine - tuned to give the right @xmath15 today when @xmath5 is of the order of unity in planck units @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 is the parameter we want to estimate .",
    "it determines the value of @xmath17 today , with smaller @xmath16 giving larger negative @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18",
    "we retrieve the cosmological constant with @xmath19 .",
    "although there is some theoretical motivation for such a potential from supersymmetric qcd ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the main reason for its introduction is phenomenological .",
    "in addition to the attractor - like solutions mentioned above , potentials of this type produce an equation - of - state parameter @xmath17 which automatically decreases to a negative value at the onset of matter domination . since the energy density of any component evolves as @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the scale factor ) , this means that while quintessence starts out as a subdominant contribution , it will eventually come to dominate the universe .",
    "we assume a spatially flat frw universe with zero cosmological constant and set the planck mass to unity . for a homogeneous and minimally coupled scalar field ,",
    "the equations of motion are then given by    [ eq : motion ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the hubble parameter , @xmath24 is the background energy density and dot and prime represent differentiation with respect to time and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "these equations can be solved numerically for the redshift dependence of the equation of state parameter @xmath25 independently of the value of the hubble constant @xmath26 .",
    "the apparent magnitude @xmath27 of a supernova is @xmath17-dependent through the luminosity distance @xmath28 , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a constant which depends on @xmath26 and the absolute magnitude of the supernova which we assume not to evolve with redshift . the second term however , is @xmath26-independent and is given by @xmath31^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\\\",
    "f(z ) & = & \\exp \\left ( 3 \\int_0^{z } dz ' \\frac{1 + w(z')}{1 + z ' } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at low redshifts , @xmath32 for any cosmology which means that low-@xmath0 events can be used to measure @xmath30 without any prior knowledge of the cosmological parameters in general and @xmath26 in particular .",
    "this is why @xmath30 is sometimes referred to as the hubble - constant - free absolute magnitude .",
    "we use the supernova observation calculator ( snoc ) @xcite , a program package developed at stockholm university , to make monte carlo simulations of magnitude - redshift datasets attainable with snap and other experiments .",
    "the fiducial frw cosmology we use is parametrized by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the inverse power - law exponent @xmath16 an integer number in the range @xmath36 ( with the value 0 corresponding to a cosmological constant ) .",
    "snap is expected to observe @xmath37 snia per year for three years at redshifts out to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "to this sample we add 300 events at @xmath39 from future low-@xmath0 supernova searches such as the snfactory .",
    "this is probably a conservative estimate of the amount of low redshift data available at the time of the snap launch in 2009 .",
    "figure  [ dist ] shows our simulated snia distribution for the combined experiments .",
    "the individual measurement error is assumed to be @xmath40 mag , including the intrinsic spread of supernova magnitudes but ignoring systematic effects from e.g.  gravitational lensing or dust .     ]",
    "we want to fit our simulated magnitude - redshift measurements for @xmath16 using the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "since we have assumed a flat universe , the other unknown parameters are @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "the best - fit values are then found by minimizing the negative log - likelihood function @xmath41 : @xmath42 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and subscript sim means simulated values .",
    "note that additive terms which only result in a shift in @xmath41 have been dropped in the above expression .",
    "the parameter ranges we consider are @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in order to minimize @xmath41 numerically",
    ", we need to know @xmath27 and thus @xmath17 for any given @xmath47 . therefore we first solve the equations of motion ( [ eq : motion ] ) for the evolution of @xmath17 using 165 different @xmath48 combinations in the above ranges and then use linear interpolation to find @xmath17 for _ any _ combination of @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "we will display our results using confidence regions in the @xmath48 plane .",
    "in this section we assume no prior knowledge of @xmath30 nor @xmath9 .",
    "this means that for each grid point in the @xmath48 plane , we find the value of @xmath30 which minimizes the negative log - likelihood function . naturally , since we are not trying to estimate @xmath30 , this value is of no importance to us .",
    "figure  [ nopriors_snap ] shows 68% confidence regions with one year of snap data .",
    "different contours correspond to the fiducial cosmology with @xmath49 . due to the strong correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath9 , it is practically impossible to distinguish between different integer @xmath16 models .",
    "the plotted confidence regions are forced to be centered on the true values of the fiducial cosmology , but that will most certainly not be the case for the real confidence region from only one experiment .",
    "however , the size and shape of the region will remain approximately the same which means that the region for any @xmath50 may drift to cover almost the entire plane . for @xmath51",
    ", we can still estimate @xmath16 to better than @xmath52 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level . in the case of a cosmological constant and a measured value centered on @xmath53",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath54 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level .     ]    combining snap with e.g.  the snfactory reduces the error contours somewhat as shown in figure  [ nopriors_lowz ] .",
    "the reason for this was given above ; adding low-@xmath0 supernovae corresponds to prior knowledge of @xmath30 , something which will become evident later when we assume exact knowledge of @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath51 , we can now estimate @xmath16 to better than @xmath55 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level . in the case of a cosmological constant and a measured value centered on @xmath53",
    ", we find @xmath56 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level .",
    "however , to break the degeneracy in parameter space we need an independent assesment of @xmath9 .     ]",
    "our assumption of no prior knowledge of @xmath9 is actually unrealistic , especially since we already assume that the universe is flat , thereby leaning heavily on the latest results from cmb measurements .",
    "these same results , as well as independent observations of the evolution of the number density of galaxy rich clusters and mass estimates of galaxy clusters , all favour a low mass universe",
    ". however , we must be certain that these measurements really are independent of @xmath17 before using them to invoke prior knowledge of @xmath9 . in @xcite ,",
    "gerke & efstathiou give a brief summary of present and future experiments which may resolve this issue and conclude that at the time of the snap launch , @xmath17-independent measurements of @xmath9 corresponding to a gaussian prior knowledge with a spread of @xmath57 may actually be a conservative expectation , whereas @xmath58 could be considered optimistic .",
    "we note that a recent analysis of 2df data already gives @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the result of imposing these priors respectively is shown in figures  [ omm_con_lowz ] and  [ omm_opt_lowz ] . with @xmath57",
    ", we can determine @xmath16 to better than @xmath60 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level for all @xmath16 .",
    "in the case of a cosmological constant and a measured value centered on @xmath53 , we can conclude that @xmath61 at the one - parameter , three - sigma level .",
    "if we instead use the optimistic spread of @xmath58 , we can determine @xmath16 to better than @xmath62 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level for all @xmath16 and in the case of a cosmological constant and a measured value centered on @xmath53 , we can conclude that @xmath56 at the one - parameter , three - sigma level .     ]     ]    finally , we have performed the same analysis assuming exact knowledge of @xmath30 .",
    "this scenario is admittedly utopian but it serves to illustrate the full potential of the snap satellite when combined with other experiments",
    ". moreover , there are plans for future experiments which could provide values of @xmath30 with a extraordinary precision .",
    "the esa satellite gaia for example , planned to be launched before 2012 , is expected to find roughly @xmath63 low-@xmath0 supernovae of all types within 4 years @xcite .",
    "figure  [ mfix_omm_opt_snap ] shows 68% , 95% and 99% confidence regions for @xmath48 assuming exact knowledge of @xmath30 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that such a scenario would enable pinpoint precision in the determination of @xmath16 and in the case of a cosmological constant the ability to rule out @xmath64 at the 99% confidence level .     ]",
    "we have investigated the possibility of using future snia observations to constrain the exponent @xmath16 of the inverse power - law quintessence potential .",
    "we do not use any parametrization of the equation of state nor any of the `` standard practices '' which according to @xcite may result in substantial estimation errors . in spite of the outstanding redshift range and measurement precision of the snap satellite , as well as the relatively accurate determination of @xmath30 possible with",
    "e.g.  the snfactory , it is clear that an independent measurement of the mass energy density @xmath9 is needed in order to make any firm predictions of the value of @xmath16 .",
    "however , armed with a gaussian prior on @xmath9 with a spread of @xmath57 , we can determine @xmath16 to better than @xmath60 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level for @xmath65 . in the case of a cosmological constant and a measured value centered on @xmath53",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath61 at the one - parameter , one - sigma level . in order to take full advantage of the snap satellite s capabilities",
    ", we would need an even more precise measurement of @xmath30 than possible with 300 low-@xmath0 snia .",
    "with such a measurement , the determination of @xmath16 would be very accurate indeed .",
    "one can argue that the inverse power - law potential is not the most favoured using current data because it does not provide low enough values of @xmath17 .",
    "sticking to integer @xmath16",
    "one finds @xmath66 today , and values as high as @xmath67 are already ruled out with present data .",
    "we have included them here to illustrate the method used and the possible accuracy of the snap satellite . in view of this ,",
    "the most important aspect of this analysis is the ability to rule out the inverse power - law potential . as such",
    "we have shown that the method is effective and it is immediately generalizable to other potentials which mimic a cosmological constant for some choice of parameter(s ) .",
    "our fitting procedure may also be used to rule out the inverse power - law potential in the case of other quintessence potentials .",
    "this is work in progress .",
