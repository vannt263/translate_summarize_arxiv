    "the event kinematics of deep inelastic scattering , dis , are determined by the negative square of the four - momentum transfer at the lepton vertex , @xmath0 , and the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the four - momentum of the proton . in the quark parton model ( qpm ) ,",
    "the interacting quark from the proton carries the four - momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the variable @xmath4 , the fractional energy transfer to the proton in the proton rest frame , is related to @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the positron - proton centre of mass energy .",
    "neutral current ( nc ) dis occurs when an uncharged boson ( @xmath9 ) is exchanged between the lepton and proton . in qpm there is a 1 + 1 parton configuration which consists of a single struck quark and the proton remnant , denoted by `` + 1 '' . at hera energies",
    "there are significant higher - order quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) corrections : to leading order in the strong coupling constant , @xmath10 these are qcd - compton scattering ( qcdc ) , where a gluon is radiated by the scattered quark and boson - gluon - fusion ( bgf ) , where the virtual boson and a gluon fuse to form a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "both processes have 2 + 1 partons in the final state",
    ". there also exists calculations for the higher , next - to - leading ( nlo ) processes .    a natural frame in which to study the dynamics of the hadronic final state in dis is the breit frame  @xcite . in this frame",
    ", the exchanged virtual boson ( @xmath11 ) is completely space - like and has a four - momentum @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the momentum of the proton in the breit frame .",
    "the particles produced in the interaction can be assigned to one of two regions : the current region if their @xmath14-momentum in the breit frame is negative , and the target region if their @xmath14-momentum is positive .",
    "the main advantage of this frame is that it gives a maximal separation of the incoming and outgoing partons in the qpm . in this model",
    "the maximum momentum a particle can have in the current region is @xmath15 while in the target region the maximum is @xmath16 in the breit frame , unlike the hadronic centre of mass ( @xmath17 ) frame , the two regions are asymmetric , particularly at low @xmath18 where the target region occupies most of the available phase space .",
    "the current region in the @xmath19 breit frame is analogous to a single hemisphere of @xmath20 annihilation . in @xmath21 annihilation",
    "the two quarks are produced with equal and opposite momenta , @xmath22 the fragmentation of these quarks can be compared to that of the quark struck from the proton ; this quark has an outgoing momentum @xmath23 in the breit frame . in the direction of this",
    "struck quark the scaled momentum spectra of the particles , expressed in terms of @xmath24 are expected to have a dependence on @xmath25 similar to that observed in @xmath20  annihilation  @xcite at energy @xmath26      within the framework of the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) there are predictions of how the higher order moments of the parton momentum spectra should evolve with the energy scale  @xcite .",
    "these parton level predictions in practice depend on two free parameters , a running strong coupling , governed by a qcd scale @xmath28 and an energy cut - off , @xmath29 below which the parton evolution is truncated . in this case",
    "@xmath30 is an effective scale parameter and is not to be identified with the standard qcd scale , e.g. @xmath31 . in particular ,",
    "predictions can be made at @xmath32 yielding the so - called limiting spectrum .",
    "the hypothesis of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , which relates the observed hadron distributions to the calculated parton distributions via a constant of proportionality , is used in conjunction with the parton predictions of the mlla to allow the calculation to be directly compared to data .",
    "the moments of the @xmath33 distributions have been investigated up to the 4th order  @xcite ; the mean @xmath34 width @xmath35 skewness @xmath36 and kurtosis @xmath37 were extracted from each distribution by fitting a distorted gaussian of the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 over a range of @xmath40 units ( for @xmath41 ) or @xmath42 units ( for @xmath43 ) in @xmath33 around the mean .",
    "the equation is motivated by the expression used for the mlla predictions of the spectra  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : qevol ] shows the moments of the @xmath33 spectra as a function of @xmath44 it is evident that the mean and width increase with increasing @xmath45 whereas the skewness and kurtosis decrease .",
    "similar fits performed on @xmath20 data  @xcite show a reasonable agreement with our results , consistent with the universality of fragmentation for this distribution at large @xmath6 .",
    "the data are compared to the mlla predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a value of @xmath46 for different values of @xmath47 a comparison is also made with the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite for the limiting spectrum ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the mlla predictions of the limiting spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite describe the mean well .",
    "however both of the mlla calculations predict a negative skewness which tends towards zero with increasing @xmath6 in the case of the limiting spectra .",
    "this is contrary to the measurements .",
    "the qualitative description of the behaviour of the skewness with @xmath6 can be achieved for a truncated cascade ( @xmath48 ) , but a consistent description of the mean , width , skewness and kurtosis can not be achieved .",
    "it can be concluded that the mlla predictions , assuming lphd , do not describe the data .",
    "it should be noted however that a moments analysis has been performed  @xcite , taking into account the limitations of the massless assumptions of the mlla predictions ; this yields good agreement between the limiting case of the mlla  @xcite and @xmath49 data over a large energy range , @xmath50      scaling violations are predicted in the fragmentation functions , which represent the probability for a parton to fragment into a particular hadron carrying a given fraction of the parton s energy .",
    "fragmentation functions , like parton densities , can not be calculated in perturbative qcd but can be evolved with the hard - process scale , using the dglap evolution  @xcite equations , from a starting distribution at a defined energy scale ; this starting distribution can be derived from a fit to data .",
    "if the fragmentation functions are combined with the cross sections for the inclusive production of each parton type in the given physical process , predictions can be made for scaling violations , expressed as the @xmath6 evolution of the @xmath52 spectra of final state hadrons @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculations ( cyclops )  @xcite of the scaled momentum distribution exist for dis .    the inclusive charged particle distribution , @xmath53 , in the current fragmentation region of the breit frame is shown in bins of @xmath52 and @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : largexp ] .",
    "the zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite data are in good agreement .",
    "the fall - off as @xmath6 increases for @xmath54 ( corresponding to the production of more particles with a smaller fractional momentum ) is indicative of scaling violations in the fragmentation function .",
    "the distributions rise with @xmath6 for @xmath55 and are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the data are compared to @xmath20 data  @xcite ( divided by two to account for the production of a @xmath56 pair ) at @xmath57 for the higher @xmath6 values shown there is a good agreement between the measurements in the current region of the breit frame in dis and the @xmath20 results ; this again supports the universality of fragmentation .",
    "the fall - off observed in the hera data at low @xmath52 and low @xmath6 is greater than that observed in @xmath20 data at spear  @xcite ; this can be attributed to processes not present in @xmath20 ( e.g. scattering off a sea quark and/or boson gluon fusion ( bgf ) ) which depopulate the current region  @xcite .",
    "a kinematic correction has recently been suggested  @xcite to the nlo calculation  @xcite of the inclusive charged particle distribution which has the form , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an effective mass to account for the massless assumption used in the fragmentation functions .",
    "it is expected to lie in the range @xmath60 the @xmath52 data are compared to the cyclops nlo qcd calculation incorporating this correction in fig .",
    "[ fig : largexp ] .",
    "this calculation combines a full next - to - leading order matrix element with the @xmath61 parton densities ( with @xmath62 and nlo fragmentation functions derived from fits to @xmath20 data @xcite .",
    "the kinematic correction allows a more legitimate theoretical comparison to lower @xmath6 and @xmath52 than was possible in earlier publications  @xcite .",
    "the bands represent the uncertainty in the predictions by taking the extreme cases of @xmath63 and @xmath64 these uncertainties are large at low @xmath6 and low @xmath65 becoming smaller as @xmath6 and @xmath52 increase . within these theoretical uncertainties there is good agreement throughout the selected kinematic range .",
    "zeus found the kinematic correction describes the general trend of the data but it was not possible to achieve a good @xmath66 fit for @xmath59 over the whole @xmath52 and @xmath6 range .",
    "in contrast h1 reported at dis99  @xcite that a good description of the data could be achieved with a value of @xmath67 the dashed line shows the zeus nlo calculation from cyclops multiplied by the kinematic correction using @xmath68 there is not a good description of the data , therefore it is concluded the distribution also depends strongly on the parameters used to generate the nlo predictions .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by this kinematic correction restrict to high @xmath6 and high @xmath52 the kinematic range that may be used to extract @xmath69 from the observed scaling violations .",
    "dis at low @xmath5 allows a study of fragmentation in the target region following the initial scattering off a sea quark ( or antiquark ) .",
    "the description based on mlla  @xcite is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] , where the quark box at the top of the gluon ladder represents the scattered sea quark plus its antiquark partner .",
    "the mlla predictions are made up of a number of contributions .",
    "contribution c , the top leg of the quark box , corresponds to fragmentation of the outgoing quark in the current region . three further contributions ( t1 , t2 and t3 ) , which are sources of soft gluons , are considered in these analytical calculations to be associated with the target region .",
    "it is predicted  @xcite that the contribution t1 ( the bottom leg of the quark box ) behaves in the same way as the current quark c and so should have no @xmath5 dependence .",
    "the contribution t2 is due to the colour field between the remnant and the struck quark , and the contribution t3 corresponds to the fragmentation of the rungs in the gluon ladder . both t2 and t3",
    "are predicted to have @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependences which differ from t1 .",
    "both the t1 and t2 contributions have been calculated and give particles of momenta @xmath70 the collinear gluons t3 , on the other hand , generally fragment to particles with momentum @xmath71 for values of the scaled momentum @xmath72 the region of phase space is analogous to the current region and has contributions mainly from t1 and t2 .",
    "the parton momentum spectra predicted by mlla , over a range of @xmath6 and @xmath18 are shown in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the target region",
    "these spectra are approximately gaussian for @xmath73 ; they peak at a value of @xmath74 in the range of @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured by zeus  @xcite , falling to a plateau region for @xmath75 ( the maximum value of @xmath52 in the target region ) .",
    "the distributions in @xmath33 are shown for both the target and current regions in fig .",
    "[ lxpda ] .",
    "the fitted curves shown are two - piece normal distributions  @xcite to guide the eye . in contrast to the current region",
    ", the target region distribution does not fall to zero as @xmath33 tends to zero .",
    "although the magnitude of the single particle density at the peak position of the current region distribution grows by a factor of about three over the @xmath6 range shown , the single particle density of the target distribution , at the @xmath52 value corresponding to the peak of the current distribution ( contribution c is equivalent to contribution t1 ) , depends less strongly on @xmath6 and increases by only about @xmath76 .",
    "in addition the @xmath33 distribution shows no significant dependence on @xmath5 when @xmath6 is kept constant . in the target region the peak position of the @xmath33 distribution increases more rapidly with @xmath6 than in the current region ; this is consistent with the behaviour expected from cylindrical phase space .",
    "the approximate gaussian distribution of the mlla predictions peaking at @xmath77  @xcite is not observed .",
    "the results strongly suggest that the target distributions are inconsistent with the mlla predictions when used in conjunction with lphd .",
    "there are predictions , based on lphd , for the rapidity distribution of charged particles in the breit frame  @xcite .",
    "( rapidity is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the energy of the particle and @xmath80 is the longitudinal component of its momentum . )",
    "it is predicted that there is a sharp rise in the charged particle density followed by a plateau with a width proportional to @xmath81 as one moves from the current to the target fragmentation region .",
    "it is also predicted that there will be another increase in the particle density and an appearance of a second plateau , with the ratio of the two plateaux being @xmath82 this ratio reflects the change in colour charge from a dominant quark one , in the current region , to the dominant gluonic one in the target fragmentation region .",
    "the rapidity distributions for charged particles are shown in fig .",
    "[ kant ]  @xcite .",
    "a flat plateau is observed at low transverse momentum , @xmath83 as @xmath84 increases , qcd effects gradually evolve the flat plateau into an approximate gaussian , peaking near zero .",
    "this illustrates the nature of the breit frame in separating the current and target fragmentation region .",
    "the expected step between the current and target region of the rapidity spectra is not observed .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ kant ] is a comparsion of the data with predictions from lo monte carlo models . in general the data",
    "is well described .",
    "ariadne  @xcite agrees well with the data but lepto  @xcite has problems in describing the high @xmath84 data and the introduction of soft colour interactions  @xcite destroys the agreement with the data .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath85 : @xmath86 is used to measure the dependence between charged particle production in the current region , @xmath87 and production in the target region , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the standard deviations of the multiplicity distributions in the current and target regions respectively . for positive correlations ,",
    "@xmath85 is positive whilst for anti - correlations it is negative . at low @xmath6",
    "these correlations are sensitive to the bgf process which depends on the gluon density of the proton  @xcite .    figure  [ fig : rho ] shows the behaviour of the correlation coefficient @xmath85 as a function of the average values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "anti - correlations are observed for all values of @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath85 decreases with increasing @xmath91 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "according to the analytic results of  @xcite these observed anti - correlations can be due to the @xmath94 effects ( qcdc and bgf ) .",
    "the @xmath95 kinematics in the breit frame can reduce the particle multiplicity in the current region and increase it in the target region . the magnitude of the anti - correlations increases with decreasing @xmath96 . according to  @xcite",
    "this can be due to an increase of the fraction of events with one or two jets produced in the target region .",
    "this behaviour is driven by an increase of the bgf rate , due to an increase in the gluon density inside the proton .",
    "these observations are , qualitatively , consistent with the depopulation effects discussed in section  [ sec : scaling ] .    in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] shows a comparison of the data with various lo monte carlo models .",
    "the ariadne model agrees well with the data .",
    "the lepto and herwig  @xcite predictions show the same trend as the data but do not reproduce the magnitude of the correlations .",
    "the event shape dependence on @xmath25 can be due to the logarithmic change of the strong coupling constant @xmath97 , and/or power corrections ( hadronisation effects ) which are expected to behave like @xmath98 .",
    "recent theoretical developments suggest that @xmath98 corrections are not necessarily related to hadronisation , but may instead be a universal soft gluon phenomenon associated with the behaviour of the running coupling at small momentum scales  @xcite .",
    "these non - perturbative corrections are governed by a parameter @xmath99",
