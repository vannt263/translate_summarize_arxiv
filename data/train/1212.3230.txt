    "it is widely accepted that luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are good tracers of the intermediate- and large - scale structures of matter in the universe . the procedure of spectroscopic identification of lrgs from the data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and advantages of its employing for statistical investigations were described , e.g. by @xcite .",
    "high intrinsic luminosity of the lrgs and uniformity of their spectral energy distribution allows to identify them at higher redshifts than the main galaxy sample ( mgs ) and so to trace a larger volume of the universe .",
    "properties of a spatial large - scale distribution of the lrgs were intensively investigated over last years ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with a special interest to a large - scale feature in their two - point correlation function and to associated series of features in the spherically - averaged power spectrum p@xmath9 ( @xmath10  mpc@xmath11 ) .",

    "the majority of the cited papers confirm the existence of a significant feature in the distribution of matter , although @xcite came to an opposite conclusion from the analysis of the sdss main galaxy sample ( mgs )  data release 7 ( dr7 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the two - point correlation function using a sample of lrgs from the sdss dr7 . in the framework of the @xmath3cdm cosmological model",
    "the authors have obtained the baryon acoustic peak at ( 12)@xmath12 significance level and determined the peak position as @xmath13  mpc within the cosmological redshift interval @xmath14 .",
    "they used the mock galaxy catalogues produced by the large suite of dark matter simulations ( lasdamas ) to estimate a sample variance and systematic errors of the calculations and thus to make their results more reliable .",
    "this result has been confirmed recently by @xcite for an extended redshift range @xmath15 with a greater significance ( 3.4  @xmath12 ) and a slightly specified position , @xmath16  mpc , of the baryon acoustic peak .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have shown that the radial ( line - of - sight ) comoving distribution of absorption - line systems ( alss ) registered in quasar ( qso ) spectra within the interval @xmath17 reveals a period of @xmath18  mpc or ( alternatively ) a temporal interval @xmath19  myr for the standard cosmological model .",
    "the proximity of the scales obtained for the spatial lrg distribution , e.g. by @xcite , and the distribution of alss by @xcite suggests to analyse the radial distribution of the same lrg sample employing the technics used by the latter authors .",

    "three significant periods , @xmath181  mpc , @xmath182  mpc , and @xmath183  mpc , were revealed by @xcite in their fourier analysis of radial galaxy distribution on the basis of sdss dr5 and 2df grs data .",
    "the periodicity found by @xcite in the radial distribution of qso alss is also included .    in spite of heterogeneity of the results , the scales in fig .",

    "especially good agreement of the main scale , @xmath5  mpc , occurs with results obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the bao scale .",
    "actually , baos are discussed in literature as a scale of the sound horizon at the recombination epoch ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) displaying itself as a single feature in the spatial correlation function ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this feature appears also as a series of regular variations ( oscillations ) imprinted in the power spectrum calculated for the spatial 3d - distribution of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they principally differ from the quasi - regular variations of the radial ( 1d ) distributions in real space discussed by @xcite and the present paper . however , it is not unlikely that both types of variations could be reconciled .",
    "the radial distribution variations probably bring out some spatial partly - ordered structure of matter in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) characterized by a long - range ( or intermediate - range ) order . in particular",
    ", one can admit the possibility that primordial acoustic perturbations , responsible for the bao , could carry traces of a partly ordering formed at some early epochs ( e.g. radiation - matter equipartition or recombination ) . in that case the radial ( 1d ) distributions , as well as the two - point 3d - space correlation function , would display a set of quasi - periodic features , which might reveal itself into a complex set of features ( e.g. peaks ) in appropriate power spectra .",
    "note that possible presence of the second feature in the two - point correlation function at a scale approximately double to the bao scale @xmath187  mpc has been revealed recently by @xcite ; see also @xcite .    in any case , the existence of the large - scale periodicities , as well as the space - ordering hypothesis , needs further verifications based on statistical properties of different cosmological objects over wider redshift regions .",
