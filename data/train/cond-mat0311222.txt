    "since the initial proposal of fractionalization ( phases where the elementary excitations are fractions of the electron ) as the underlying explanation for the unusual properties of the cuprate superconductors @xcite , there has been much progress in the theoretical understanding of these phases . whether such fractionalized phases in the absence of magnetic fields in spatial dimension greater than one are actually realized in any experimental system is a matter of current debate .",
    "fractionalized phases can exhibit properties that are strikingly different from conventional phases of matter , hence they are attractive candidates for modeling strongly correlated systems that exhibit anomalous behaviour",
    ". however , unambiguous experimental evidence for the presence of such phases in any experimental system is still lacking . in part this may be because the correlations in such phases are subtle , and hence definitive experimental signatures are hard to devise .",
    "this provides a strong motivation to seek a deeper understanding of these phases .",
    "furthermore , fractionalized states have been proposed as a means to build quantum bits that are inherently robust against decoherence @xcite .",
    "an important theoretical development has been the discovery of a number of microscopic models @xcite that can be shown to exhibit this exotic physics .",
    "although these microscopic models are defined in terms of bosons ( or spins ) on a lattice with short ranged interactions , fractional excitations that are charged under an emergent gauge field , as well as excitations of this emergent gauge field are obtained on solving these models .",
    "however till date , there have been no microscopic models available with the full su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry .",
    "indeed it is important to verify that the additional constraints imposed by spin rotation symmetry do not exclude the possibility of fractionalization . here",
    "we will describe a model that possesses the full spin rotation symmetry , but can be explicitly shown to exhibit fractionalization and possess an emergent gauge field in the deconfined phase .",
    "moreover this model is found to have a quantum critical point with full spin rotation symmetry , but which is distinct from the heisenberg transition .",
    "the properties of the fractionalized phase and the transition , as well as various deformations on the model , will be studied in detail in this paper .",
    "most of the earlier work that constructed models exhibiting fractionalization engineered the energetics so as to select a low energy manifold .",
    "constraining states to lie in this manifold introduces the gauge fields , which then need to be in the deconfined phase for fractionalization to occur . here",
    "we will rely on a different route to fractionalization , which may be described as fractionalization from defect suppression . indeed",
    "this approach is closer in spirit to @xcite , where the @xmath2 fractionalized state was regarded as a quantum disordered superconductor , obtained by proliferating even winding - number vortices while suppressing vortices of odd winding number .    here",
    "we will mainly be concerned with the o(3 ) sigma model in d=2 + 1 .",
    "this model consists of o(3 ) quantum rotors represented by unit three - vectors ( ` spins ' ) , defined on the sites of a two dimensional spatial lattice .",
    "neighbouring rotors are coupled via a ferromagnetic interaction . by the usual quantum to classical statistical physics mapping",
    ", the ground state properties of this model can be conveniently mapped onto the physics of the heisenberg model at finite temperature in three dimensions . clearly , there exist point topological defects in the three dimensional heisenberg model that carry an integer topological charge , which simply correspond to hedgehog configurations of the spins . in terms of the quantum model , these are events in space - time ( instantons ) which change the skyrmion number of the system .",
    "we now ask the question : is it possible to disorder the three dimensional heisenberg model in the effective absence of the hedgehog defects ? this has been a long standing issue , discussed in several works , for example @xcite , but had not been conclusively settled . here",
    "we will present fresh results from monte carlo simulations and arguments that convincingly demonstrate that the answer to this question is yes .    having established this",
    ", we will ask the question , what is the nature of this hedgehog - free paramagnetic phase @xmath3 ? although the spin - spin correlations are short ranged , the absence of hedgehog fluctuations lead to a ` hidden order ' in this phase .",
    "indeed , it will be proposed that the physics of the hedgehog - free model is captured by what we will call the _ non - compact _ @xmath0(nc@xmath0 ) @xcite model in d=2 + 1 .",
    "this model consists of a doublet of bosonic fields ( ` spinons ' ) that transforms as a spinor under spin rotations , coupled to a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field ( ` photon ' ) . in this representation ,",
    "the hedgehogs correspond to the monopoles of the u(1 ) gauge field , and eliminating hedgehogs leads to the noncompactness of the gauge field .",
    "the nc@xmath0model has two obvious phases , one where the spinons are condensed which is the ferromagnetic phase , and the other where the spinons are gapped , which corresponds to an exotic paramagnet , with a gapless photon excitation . to verify that the paramagnetic phase @xmath3 obtained by the hedgehog - free disordering of the o(3 ) sigma model is indeed the same phase as the paramagnet in the nc@xmath0model",
    ", we use the monte carlo method to measure the correlations of the spin chirality , which is roughly @xmath4 for a triangular face with three spins @xmath5 .",
    "this should be equivalent to the flux correlations of the noncompact gauge theory . indeed the expected long range correlation functions with the very characteristic dipolar form are found .",
    "furthermore , this correspondence implies that the ordering transition of hedgehog - free o(3 ) model is not in the heisenberg universality class , but in the same universality class as the ordering transition of the nc@xmath0model .",
    "this may be checked by comparing the universal critical exponents in the two models .",
    "indeed , we find that the hedgehog - free o(3 ) model undergoes a continuous ordering transition with critical exponents that are clearly distinct from the heisenberg exponents , but which are consistent with the exponents obtained in direct monte carlo simulation of the transition in the nc@xmath0model .",
    "this provides further evidence that the nc@xmath0model captures the physics of the hedgehog - free o(3 ) model .",
    "these exponents also turn out to be consistent with those obtained from an earlier attempt to disorder the hedgehog - free o(3 ) model @xcite .    given the central role played by the nc@xmath0model , we also present analytical results on some of the striking properties of this model .",
    "first , we consider the easy - plane deformation of the nc@xmath0model when the full spin rotation symmetry is broken down to u(1 ) by the presence of easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "this model is found to have the amazing property that under the standard duality transformation , it maps back onto itself .",
    "in particular the zero temperature ordering transition is found to be self - dual .",
    "second , we consider the effect of finite temperature in the nc@xmath0model .",
    "we argue that there is a thermal kosterlitz - thouless phase transition out of the @xmath3 phase .",
    "this can be understood as an ionization transition of the logarithmically interacting spinons .",
    "the logarithmic interaction is of course the coulomb potential in two spatial dimensions and hence the presence of such a transition is proof of the existence of gauge charged particles .",
    "we now briefly comment on the relation of the present paper to earlier relevant work .",
    "lau and dasgupta @xcite , considered the o(3 ) model in three euclidean dimensions on a cubic lattice and applied complete monopole suppression at every cube of the lattice .",
    "this strong constraint led to the model always being in the ferromagnetic phase , and the exotic paramagnet was not uncovered in that work .",
    "subsequently , in an important extension , kamal and murthy @xcite allowed for a more flexible definition of the no monopole constraint by allowing monopole - antimonopole pair fluctuations if they occurred on neighbouring cubes . in this way , they were able to obtain a disordered phase , and also found a continuous ordering transition with non - heisenberg exponents .",
    "however , as pointed out in that work itself , there are unsatisfactory features of this algorithm when closely spaced monopoles occur .",
    "the problem arises in the presence of loops of monopole and antimonopoles , where combining them in pairs is ambiguous .",
    "this allows for monte carlo moves that annihilate a monopole and an antimonopole belonging to different pairs , since the remaining monopoles and anti - monopoles on the loop can be ` re - paired ' .",
    "this requires making a time consuming nonlocal check for re - pairing , every time such an event is generated .",
    "consequently , kamal and murthy had to resort to the approximation of making only local checks of re - pairing .",
    "the algorithm then also has the undesirable property that a given configuration of spins may be allowed or not allowed depending on the history of how it is generated .",
    "here we will adopt a more restrictive condition - that monopole anti - monopole pairs are allowed only if they are _ isolated _ - to completely circumvent these problems . an improved procedure for defining the monopole number",
    "allows us to easily work with more complicated lattices .",
    "this flexibility will prove very useful in obtaining the disordered phase .",
    "furthermore , our identification of the nc@xmath0model to describe this physics allows us to bring a whole series of tests to bear on the @xmath3 phase and the transition , which was not done previously in the absence of such an understanding .    in this paper",
    "we will be completely suppressing the free hedgehog defects , i.e. setting their fugacity to zero .",
    "we now briefly discuss the effect of a finite fugacity , and possible relevance of the physics described here to systems that may be realized in nature .",
    "it is well known that for pure @xmath1 gauge theories in d=2 + 1 , introduction of monopoles leads to confinement @xcite .",
    "this result also implies that the @xmath3 phase is unstable to the introduction of a nonzero hedgehog ( or monopole ) fugacity .",
    "however , if this fugacity is small to begin with , deconfinement physics would play an important role in the finite temperature or short wavelength properties of the system .    while a finite monopole fugacity necessarily destroys the zero temperature @xmath3 phase , its effect on the phase transition ,",
    "where critical gauge charged bosons are present which act to hinder monopole tunneling , is less obvious . in fact , in the sigma model description of the spin half antiferromagnet on the square lattice , berry phase effects @xcite lead to a quadrupling of the monopoles @xcite , which are then more likely to be irrelevant as compared to single monopole insertions .",
    "if monopoles are then irrelevant at the critical point , the transition could still be controlled by the monopole suppressed o(3 ) critical point ( or equally the critical nc@xmath0model ) .",
    "however , monopole relevance in the adjoining @xmath3 phase implies that this transition is sandwiched between two conventional ( not deconfined ) phases .",
    "this dangerously - irrelevant - monopoles scenario is advocated in a forthcoming paper @xcite , which argues that it is possible to have a continuous transition between a neel and valence bond solid ( vbs ) state for the square lattice spin half antiferromagnet , which is in the same universality class as the hedgehog free o(3 ) transition ( i.e.  the critical nc@xmath0theory ) studied here .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite argues that the easy plane version of this transition may already have been seen in the numerical experiments of @xcite , where there appears to be a continuous transition between a spin ordered state and a vbs in a square lattice spin half model with easy plane anisotropy .",
    "such a direct transition is very natural in the dangerously - irrelevant - monopoles scenario , and would be controlled by the critical nc@xmath0model with easy plane anisotropy , which is also studied in this paper .",
    "thus , the transitions of the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model , in both the isotropic and easy plane limits , could be realized in these situations even without explicit hedgehog suppression , and might potentially be seen directly in nature .",
    "finally , we note that in d=3 + 1 a deconfined phase , with photons and gapped spin half particles , can in principle exist even with a nonzero hedgehog fugacity .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section [ supression ]",
    "we study the o(3 ) sigma model with hedgehog suppression .",
    "we begin by describing the particular lattice geometry and hedgehog suppression scheme used in the monte carlo calculations .",
    "we then present monte carlo results that show the presence of a spin disordered phase in our hedgehog suppressed model .",
    "we argue that the physics of the hedgehog suppressed sigma model is captured by the nc@xmath0model , which implies the presence of photons in this disordered phase .",
    "this leads to the prediction that spin chirality correlations in the disordered phase take on a very particular long ranged form which is tested in the monte carlo calculations .",
    "next , we turn to the universal properties of the ordering transition in this hedgehog suppressed model and find exponents that are distinct from the heisenberg exponents .",
    "these are then compared with exponents calculated from directly simulating the nc@xmath0model . in section [ variations ] , we consider various deformations of the nc@xmath0model that correspond to an easy plane anisotropy , a zeeman field , and the effect of finite temperature . in particular",
    "we prove the remarkable self duality of the easy plane model .",
    "finally , in section [ 3d ] we briefly discuss possible higher dimensional extensions of this physics .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations of the three dimensional classical o(3 ) sigma model with hedgehog suppression . the lattice that we consider is a decorated cubic lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ decmodel]a , with unit vectors @xmath6 at the vertices and edge - centers of the cubic lattice .",
    "as described below , monopole numbers are associated with the centers of each of these cubes .",
    "this choice allows for more spin fluctuations when hedgehog suppression is applied than the simple cubic geometry of refs .  .",
    "neighbouring spins are coupled via the usual ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction and hence allowed states are weighed with the factor @xmath7 , with the energy function @xmath8 given by : @xmath9    in order to define the monopole number in each cube , we follow reference @xcite and first introduce an auxiliary variable , the gauge potential @xmath10 between any pair of neighbouring sites with spin orientations @xmath11 .",
    "this is defined by introducing an arbitrary reference vector @xmath12 and forming the spherical triangle ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the edges of a spherical triangle are of course segments of great circles .",
    "if the solid angle subtended by this spherical triangle is @xmath14 $ ] , then we define :    @xmath15 } \\\\",

    "thus , gauge invariant quantities are independent of the choice of the reference vector .",
    "note also that @xmath20 and these gauge fields are only defined modulo @xmath21 .",
    "thus we have defined a compact gauge field in terms of the spins .",
    "we then define a flux @xmath22 on every face bounded by the sites @xmath23 : @xmath24 with @xmath25 $ ] . clearly , the flux is gauge invariant and hence independent of the choice of reference vector @xmath12 .",
    "the physical meaning of the flux is most readily appreciated by considering a triangular face with spins @xmath5 , where it is approximately the spin chirality : @xmath26    the hedgehog number @xmath27 enclosed in a given volume is then the net flux out of this volume @xmath28 , which is guaranteed to be an integer from the previous definitions .",
    "note that the hedgehog number is simply some function of the spins on a given cube .",
    "this definition is identical to the traditionally used definition of hedgehog number for volumes that are bounded by triangular faces . for",
    "more complicated geometries ( like the one employed in this work ) however it is a much more natural and powerful definition , since it does not rely on an arbitrary triangulation of the faces and can be quickly computed .",
    "-2 mm    we now consider whether a disordered phase may be obtained while suppressing the hedgehog configurations .",
    "this will favour the ferromagnetic state which is clearly free of hedgehogs ; indeed with full hedgehog suppression on the simple cubic lattice @xcite an ordered phase was found even at zero spin coupling . in the decorated lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ decmodel]a , full hedgehog suppression in each cube seems to give rise to a disordered state for small values of the spin coupling @xmath29 .",
    "however , in order to open a larger window of disordered phase , and obtain more solid evidence of disorder in the system sizes available , we will allow for hedgehog - antihedgehog fluctuations on nearest neighbour ( face sharing ) cubes .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , we will only allow for configurations with _ isolated _ hedgehog - antihedgehog pairs ; in other words if a cube contains a hedgehog of strength @xmath30 , it must contain a nearest neighbour cube with a hedgehog of strength @xmath31 and no hedgehogs in all other nearest neighbour cubes .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ decmodel]b and gives an unambiguous prescription for combining the hedgehog and antihedgehogs into isolated , neutral pairs , and allows us to avoid altogether the problems in the work of @xcite , where such an isolation of pairs was not demanded .",
    "to summarize , the statistical ensemble is defined as follows . for each spin configuration , we determine the hedgehog numbers associated with each cube of the lattice . if this sample clears the constraint of no free hedgehogs , ( we mentioned two versions of this constraint , full suppression constraint and the isolated neutral pairs constraint ) , then this configuration is allowed in the ensemble and is weighted with a relative probability determined by the energy function ( [ e ] ) .",
    "we simulate this ensemble @xcite using single spin metropolis updates in the restricted configuration space .",
    "the data presented below is taken for 20,000 - 200,000 metropolis steps per spin .",
    "we now discuss the results of the monte carlo simulation with hedgehog suppression .",
    "first , in the absence of any hedgehog suppression , the system is found to have the usual heisenberg ordering transition at @xmath32 . implementing hedgehog suppression that only allows neutral , isolated pairs of hedgehogs to occur , gives a smaller but still sizeable region @xmath33 over which the system remains magnetically disordered .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ magn ] where the magnetization per spin @xmath34 is plotted for varying system sizes with linear dimension @xmath35 ( the total number of spins is @xmath36 ) .",
    "the magnetization per spin is seen to approach zero with increasing system size , for small enough values of @xmath29 .",
    "a more convincing demonstration is made in the inset , where we plot the product of @xmath34 and the square root of the total number of spins .",
    "for disordered spins , the average magnetization per spin is expected to decrease as @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , as seen in the figure , this situation is realized at least for @xmath38 .    , with @xmath39 , as a function of @xmath29 for different system sizes ( we show the data for both sweep directions ) .",
    "inset shows the product @xmath40 ; in the magnetically disordered phase , we expect the measured @xmath41 ( for completely uncorrelated spins , the numerical coefficient is close to @xmath42 ) ]    -2 mm    one may nevertheless worry if there is some other spin order , such as antiferromagnetic or spiral order , that is not detected by the above zero - momentum magnetization .",
    "the most direct evidence against any magnetic order is obtained from the spin - spin correlation , which is found to be ferromagnetic throughout and rather short - ranged . for @xmath43",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ spincorr ] , and the spin correlation indeed decays very quickly , with the correlation length of order one half lattice spacing .",
    "the above does not mean that the spins are completely uncorrelated , rather that their correlation is more subtle as we will see below .",
    ", measured for spins at the vertices of the cubic lattice separated by a distance @xmath44 along the @xmath45 direction .",
    "the system size is @xmath46 , so the measurements are done for @xmath47 .",
    "note the logarithmic scale for the vertical axis ; the lower cutoff is roughly the limit of what can be reliably measured in our monte carlo . ]",
    "-2 mm    this completes the evidence for the presence of a magnetically disordered phase @xmath3 with suppressed hedgehogs .",
    "we now investigate the nature of this paramagnetic phase .",
    "we argue below that the @xmath3 phase of the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model is distinct from the regular paramagnetic phase @xmath48 in the model without such suppression .",
    "the sharp distinction arises from the fact that @xmath3 contains a low energy photon excitation .",
    "while this is best understood by rewriting the o(3 ) sigma model in the @xmath0representation , we first provide a heuristic argument for why such a low energy excitation may appear before passing to this more complete explanation .    at",
    "any given time slice , the spin configuration ( now of spins in a plane ) can be given a skyrmion number .",
    "it is easily seen that hedgehog events change the skyrmion number by unity .",
    "therefore , suppressing hedgehogs implies that the skyrmion number is a conserved quantity . thus ,",
    "if @xmath49 is the skyrmion density and @xmath50 are skyrmion currents , they satisfy the conservation law @xmath51 with @xmath52",
    ". this condition may be solved by writing @xmath53 , in which the skyrmion current is identified with the flux of a u(1 ) gauge field . a natural dynamics would then be given by a lagrangian @xmath54 , which would give rise to a linearly dispersing photon .",
    "to gain further insight into the nature of the @xmath3 phase , we use the @xmath0representation of the o(3 ) sigma model .",
    "it is well known that the pure o(3 ) sigma model ( no hedgehog suppression ) can be rewritten in terms of a pair of complex bosonic fields @xmath55 that is minimally coupled to a _",
    "compact _ gauge field .",
    "the fields @xmath56 transform as spinors under spin rotations , and have unit magnitude @xmath57 .",
    "the spin vector is given by the bilinear @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 are the pauli matrices ) , and the flux of the gauge field corresponds to the skyrmion density of the original spin variables .",
    "compactness of the gauge field implies the existence of monopoles , which act as sources or sinks of the gauge flux .",
    "these are then to be identified with the hedgehogs which change the skyrmion number when they occur .",
    "clearly , this @xmath0model has two phases , one where the @xmath56 particles are ` condensed ' which is the ferromagnetic phase ( since the gauge neutral unit vectors @xmath60 acquire an expectation value ) , and another where the @xmath56 particles are gapped .",
    "the gapped phase is essentially equivalent , at low energies , to a pure compact gauge theory which is known to be confining in d=2 + 1 @xcite .",
    "this we associate with the regular paramagnetic phase .",
    "we now turn to a description of the phases with full hedgehog suppression within the @xmath0representation .",
    "indeed , given the identification of the hedgehog defects with the monopoles of the @xmath0theory , hedgehog suppression implies monopole suppression .",
    "this is most directly implemented by passing to a _",
    "noncompact _ gauge field which is free of monoples .",
    "the distinction between a compact and a noncompact gauge theory can not be overemphasized here , since it underlies all the new physics obtained in this work .",
    "the euclidean action for the noncompact @xmath0model on a lattice is given by : @xmath61 where the lattice curl is the sum of the gauge potentials around a plaquette .",
    "this nc@xmath0model has two obvious phases - first , a phase where the @xmath56 particles are ` condensed ' which is the ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "second , a phase where the @xmath56 particles are gapped - this we identify with the paramagnetic phase @xmath3 .",
    "however , the noncompact nature of the gauge field implies that there will be a low energy photon excitation in this phase .",
    "indeed , within the nc@xmath0model , the asymptotic correlation of the flux @xmath62 in this phase is simply governed by the free propagation of the photon which leads to the characteristic dipolar form : @xmath63 in particular , for two points separated along the @xmath45 direction , we would expect @xmath64 where @xmath65 is some numerical coefficient .",
    "this prediction of the emergence of a photon in the @xmath3 phase may be readily checked by using the definition eq .",
    "( [ adef ] , [ flux ] ) of the flux in terms of the spins on a face ( the spin chirality ) , and studying its correlations @xmath66 in the hedgehog suppressed sigma model ( as usual , @xmath67 is the flux through a face perpendicular to @xmath68 ) .",

    "however , for the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) transition we find this exponent to be fairly large @xmath108 ( and @xmath109 from direct simulations of the nc@xmath0model ) .",
    "a large @xmath105 is to be expected if the magnon field @xmath60 can decay into two deconfined spinons .",
    "indeed , in the limit of noninteracting spinons , this exponent is expected to approach unity .",
    "hence , the large @xmath105 obtained at this transition is to be expected on physical grounds .",
    "in this section we consider various deformations of the nc@xmath0model , and the effect of finite temperatures .",
    "the motivation for this is twofold .",
    "first , understanding the behaviour of this model in these limits will provide us with a whole slew of potential checks to further strengthen the identification between the nc@xmath0model and the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model .",
    "some of these explicit checks , like the correspondence in the easy plane limits and the effect of a zeeman field on the isotropic models , will be presented elsewhere @xcite , while others are left for future work .",
    "second , we will see below that these models have several interesting properties and may themselves be directly realizable .",
    "for example , the continuous transition seen in the numerical experiments of @xcite has been conjectured in @xcite to be described by the easy plane nc@xmath0model .",
    "we first consider modeling the easy plane deformation of our o(3 ) invariant sigma model with hedgehog suppression .",
    "this can be accomplished , e.g. , by having ferromagnetic interaction between neighboring spins of the form @xmath110 .",
    "clearly , in this case the spins would prefer to lie in the @xmath111 plane in spin space ; the global spin symmetry of this model is now broken down from o(3 ) to @xmath112 , where the @xmath113 corresponds to spin rotations about the @xmath114 axis in spin space , and @xmath2 arises from symmetry under @xmath115 .",
    "the appropriate deformation of the nc@xmath0model involves applying the term @xmath116 at each site with @xmath117 that favours equal amplitudes for the two components of the spinor field .",
    "the corresponding @xmath60 vector will then like to lie in the easy plane .",
    "we will call this the easy plane nc@xmath0model .",
    "in fact it will be useful to consider the limit of extreme easy plane anisotropy , where the amplitude fluctuations of the @xmath56 fields are frozen out , and only the phase fluctuations remain .",
    "the @xmath56 field can then be parametrized by @xmath118 , and the direction of the spin in the easy plane is given by @xmath119 .",
    "the partition function on a lattice in three euclidean dimensions can then be written as : @xmath120 '   \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi [ d\\phi_1 d\\phi_2 ] e^{-s_{ep } } ~ , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber s_{ep } & = & -j \\sum_{r , \\mu }   \\left [   \\cos(\\delta_\\mu \\phi_1 - a_\\mu )        + \\cos(\\delta_\\mu \\phi_2 - a_\\mu ) \\right ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & & + \\frac{k}{2 } \\sum_{\\box } ( { \\bm \\delta } \\times { \\bf a})^2 ~ , \\label{sep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration over the gauge fields is performed after suitable gauge fixing to ensure finiteness of the partition function ( hence the prime in the integration measure : @xmath121'$ ] ) .",
    "below , we will consider applying the standard duality transformations on this model @xcite .",
    "for this purpose it is more convenient to pass to the villain representation which makes use of the approximate rewriting @xmath122 .",
    "note that the villain form has the same @xmath21 periodicity , @xmath123 , as the original partition weight , and for large @xmath29 we will have @xmath124 .",
    "the villain form is expected to retain the universal properties and phase structure of the original model and therefore we will start with it and consider a series of exact transformations that perform the duality .",
    "the partition function written in the dual variables will be seen to be essentially the same as that written in the direct variables thus establishing the ` self - dual ' nature of these models .",
    "the villain form of the partition function is : @xmath125 '   \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi [ d\\phi_1 d\\phi_2 ]   \\sum_{{{\\bf j}}_1,\\ , { { \\bf j}}_2 }   e^ { -\\frac{k}{2 } \\sum ( { \\bm \\delta } \\times { \\bf a})^2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & e^ { -\\frac{1}{2{\\mathcal j } } \\sum ( { { \\bf j}}_1 ^ 2 + { { \\bf j}}_2 ^ 2 ) } e^ { i\\sum [ ( { \\bm \\delta}\\phi_1 -{\\bf a } ) { { \\bf j}}_1             + ( { \\bm \\delta}\\phi_2 -{\\bf a } ) { { \\bf j}}_2 ] } ~ , \\label{villain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 are integer current fields that live on the links of the lattice .",
    "we first write @xmath127 as a model in terms of the current loops only , and then perform an exact rewriting ( duality ) in terms of the vortex loops .",
    "the two forms will have essentially identical characters when viewed as integer loop models ; with proper identification of the coupling constants , this is the statement of self - duality .",
    "we begin by integrating out the phase fields @xmath128 .",
    "this imposes the condition that the integer current fields @xmath129 are divergence free .",
    "these integer loops are simply the world lines of the two bosons @xmath130 , which carry the same gauge charge and hence their sum couples to the gauge field .",
    "integrating out the gauge field gives rise to a long range biot - savart type interaction between the total currents .",
    "the result can be written as : @xmath131 thus , the original model is equivalent to a model of integer current loops @xcite , where the combinations @xmath132 have short range interactions , while the gauge charged current combinations @xmath133 have long ranged interactions with the asymptotic form @xmath134 .",
    "we now perform an exact duality transformation on ( [ currentloops ] ) .",
    "first , the divergence free current loops can be written as the lattice curl of a vector field @xmath135 that lives on the links of the dual lattice , and the integer constraint is implemented using the identity : @xmath136 . integrating out the fields @xmath137 we",
    "obtain the following form for the partition function in terms of the dual integer current loops @xmath138",
    ": @xmath139 one can argue that the two integer loops of this dual representation ( [ dualoops ] ) are precisely interpreted as the vorticities in the original two boson fields .",
    "a vortex of equal strength in both boson fields ( @xmath140 ) can be screened by the gauge field , and hence has only short range interactions , while unbalanced vortices which can not be completely screened interact via long range interactions .",
    "correspondingly , the combination of the dual currents @xmath141 interact via a short range interaction @xmath142 , while the other combination @xmath143 has a long range interaction with the same asymptotic form as in ( [ gplus ] ) , @xmath144 .",
    "indeed the partition function written in terms of dual loops ( [ dualoops ] ) is essentially the same as when written in terms of the direct variables ( [ currentloops ] ) , which can be seen by making the association @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the only differences are in the form of the short range interactions which do not affect universal properties .",
    "as argued below this immediately implies that the transition between @xmath3 and @xmath100 phases in this model will be self - dual . of course",
    ", we can also rewrite ( [ dualoops ] ) in terms of the fields conjugate to the currents @xmath138 , obtaining the action in terms of the dual ( vortex ) fields and the dual gauge field , which will have essentially the same form as the original action eq .",
    "( [ villain ] ) .",
    "we do not spell this out here since the exhibited forms already suffice .",
    "we first note the description of the various phases in terms of the properties of boson current loops and also the vortex ( dual ) loops . in the direct representation ,",
    "when the partition function is dominated by small loops of @xmath147 , the system is in the ` insulating ' or paramagnetic state @xmath3 . in this phase",
    "there is a single low energy excitation - the photon . on the other hand , when these loops become arbitrarily large , which certainly occurs if both @xmath148 , we are in the ` superfluid ' or ferromagnetic phase @xmath100 . here",
    "too we have a single low lying mode , the magnon , which is the goldstone mode arising from the spontaneously broken spin symmetry within the easy plane .",
    "the two integer loops of the dual representation ( [ dualoops ] ) correspond to the world lines of the vortices in the two boson fields .",
    "it is easily seen , for example by analyzing the dual action in different parameter extremes , that the @xmath3 phase occurs if _ large _ vortex loops of both @xmath149 proliferate , while if both the vortex loops are typically small , the @xmath100 phase results .    in terms of the direct boson variables , the @xmath100 phase is the ordered phase , and hence has a low energy goldstone mode , while the @xmath3 phase is the disordered phase and has a low energy photon mode . in the dual variables",
    "the roles are reversed - the @xmath100 phase is the disordered phase with the dual photon , while the @xmath3 phase is the dual ` ordered ' phase , with the goldstone mode .",
    "in particular , a direct transition between @xmath3 and @xmath100 can either be thought of as an ordering transition in the direct variables , or the reverse in terms of the dual variables .",
    "this interchange of ordered and disordered phases is typical of a duality transformation .",
    "what is special in this case is that the partition function is essentially identical when written in terms of the direct and dual variables .",
    "this implies that the transition must be self - dual .",
    "one direct consequence of this self duality is that the critical exponent ( @xmath86 ) measuring the rise of the order parameter on the ordered side of the transition is equal to that of a suitably defined _ disorder _ parameter on the opposite side of the transition .",
    "further consequences arising from the self duality and other phases contained in this easy plane nc@xmath0model will be discussed at length elsewhere @xcite , along with results of monte carlo studies . here , we just note that a continuous transition from the @xmath3 to @xmath100 phase is obtained , with critical indices : @xmath150    finally , we note that this critical point is conjectured in @xcite to control the continuous transition seen in the numerical experiments of @xcite .",
    "we now consider applying a uniform zeeman field along the @xmath151 direction in spin space , @xmath152 , and study the effect on the various phases and phase transitions in both the isotropic and easy plane models . in the @xmath0representation this term can be written as : @xmath153 which breaks the @xmath154 and the only remaining symmetry is that of @xmath1 spin rotations about the @xmath151 axis .    model .",
    "( a ) isotropic case - two distinct paramagnetic phases exist in the presence of a zeeman field .",
    "the @xmath3 phase has a low lying excitation , the photon , while the @xmath48 phase is gapped and breaks no global symmetries .",
    "the two are separated by a continuous transition in the 3d xy universality class ( the arrow indicates the ordered to disordered 3d xy transition ) . at zero field",
    "the transition @xmath155 is described by the critical nc@xmath0model .",
    "( b ) easy plane case - zeeman field is applied perpendicular to the easy plane .",
    "spins can order in the easy plane to give the @xmath100 phase which has a low lying excitation , the goldstone mode .",
    "this is separated from the disordered @xmath48 phase by a 3d xy transition .",
    "there are two paramagnetic phases , @xmath3 with a photon and a gapped @xmath48 phase separated by a 3d xy transition . at zero zeeman field",
    "the two 3d xy transitions meet to give the self dual @xmath156 transition.,width=345 ]    -2 mm    for the model with the isotropic exchange coupling , adding the term ( [ zeeman ] ) to the action ( [ noncompact ] ) will result in the phase diagram shown in figure ( [ zeemanfig]a ) . at zero field",
    "we have the @xmath3 and @xmath100 phases separated by the monopole suppressed o(3 ) transition , or equivalently the nc@xmath0ordering transition @xmath155 . turning up the zeeman field , the ordered moment of @xmath100 locks into the field direction",
    "- the resulting phase does not break any of the global symmetries and has no low lying modes .",
    "hence we will call this phase @xmath48 .",
    "( note that for the isotropic nc@xmath0model at zero temperature , this phase is only present when a zeeman field is applied ) .",
    "this phase can be understood as a higgs phase with condensation of the @xmath157 field but not of the @xmath158 field .    on the other hand , in the @xmath3 phase",
    "there is a gap to @xmath157 and @xmath158 particles .",
    "turning up the zeeman coupling lowers the @xmath157 branch until at the transition it condenses to give the @xmath48 phase .",
    "thus , the transition between the @xmath3 and @xmath48 phases involves condensing a single scalar field coupled to a gauge field and hence is expected to be in the inverted - xy universality class @xcite ( i.e. the @xmath3 to @xmath48 transition is the ordered phase to disordered phase transition of the 3d xy model ) .",
    "the shape of the phase boundary near the zero field transition can be related to the critical exponents of the nc@xmath0model . in particular",
    "it depends on the ratio of the scaling dimension of the zeeman operator ( @xmath159 for the isotropic case ) to the scaling dimension of the ` thermal ' operator ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath161 is the deviation away from the zero field critical point @xmath162 , then the phase boundary is given by the curve    @xmath163    .",
    "the expressions for the scaling dimensions yield @xmath164 . using the numerical values of the exponents in eq .",
    "( [ expnccp1 ] ) , we have @xmath165 , which gives a phase boundary that approaches the isotropic transition point horizontally as shown in figure [ zeemanfig]a .    for the model with easy plane exchange coupling , the effect of adding the zeeman field perpendicular to the easy plane can be argued to lead to the phase diagram in figure [ zeemanfig]b .",
    "here we avoid using the extreme easy plane limit , where @xmath151 was set identically to zero , in order to have a finite coupling to the applied field .",
    "( alternatively , we can model the effect of the zeeman field by considering an action similar to eq .",
    "[ sep ] but with different couplings @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the two angle variables . ) at zero field we have the @xmath3 and @xmath100 phases separated by the monopole suppressed easy plane transition .",
    "again , in the presence of a zeeman field , a @xmath48 phase is possible , with no spontaneously broken symmetry and no low lying excitations , where only the @xmath157 field is condensed .",
    "the phase transition between @xmath3 and @xmath48 is then driven by the condensation of the gauge charged @xmath157 field , and is hence expected to be in the same universality class as the ordered to disordered transition of the 3d xy model @xcite . starting in the @xmath48 phase , as the exchange coupling is further increased , it becomes favourable for the @xmath158 field to also condense , so that there develops a finite expectation value for the in - plane spin operators @xmath168 .",
    "this leads to the @xmath100 phase , which spontaneously breaks the remaining spin rotation symmetry and has one goldstone mode .",
    "since the gauge field has already been ` higgsed ' away , this transition is the regular ordering transition of the 3d xy model . as described previously , the original easy plane model is essentially self dual , and this remains true on adding the zeeman term .",
    "this explains the ` reflection ' symmetry of the universal properties in the phase diagram - for example the duality interchanges the @xmath3 and @xmath100 phases while the @xmath48 phase is taken to itself .",
    "this also implies that the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath48 must be in the same universality class as the transition from @xmath100 to @xmath48 , which was indeed the result of the previous analysis , which finds them both to be in the 3d xy universality class .",
    "the shape of the phase boundaries near the zero field easy plane transition can be related to the critical exponents of the easy plane nc@xmath0model using equation [ curve ] . while the thermal eigenvalue in this case is already known ( eqn . [ easyplaneexp ] ) , the scaling dimension of the zeeman operator needs to be determined .",
    "this is conveniently done within the easy plane nc@xmath0model at criticality , by studying the scaling dimension of the operator that gives rise to unequal hopping strengths @xmath169 for the two species of bosons in eqn .",
    "[ sep ] . to this end , consider defining the link operators : @xmath170 clearly , adding @xmath171 will give rise to unequal hoppings , and hence has an overlap with the zeeman operator .",
    "similarly , @xmath172 will have an overlap with the ` thermal ' operator .",
    "thus , studying the power law decay of the correlators of @xmath173 at criticality allows us to extract the scaling dimensions of the zeeman and thermal operators .",
    "the latter may be compared against other , more accurate determinations of the same quantity and serves as a check of this approach .",
    "thus we find : @xmath174 the value of @xmath175 obtained is consistent with the value of @xmath176 quoted in eqn .",
    "[ easyplaneexp ] from which @xmath177 .",
    "thus we have @xmath178 . note that since @xmath179 , the shapes of the phase boundaries are as shown in figure [ zeemanfig]b @xcite .",
    "the nc@xmath0representation of the hedgehog - free easy - plane model in the presence of a zeeman field also arises in the context of two component superconductors , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite where the continuum version of this identification was also noted .",
    "finally we note that these properties of the easy plane model in the presence of a perpendicular zeeman field are potentially useful to testing the conjecture of @xcite that the continuous transition seen in the numerical experiments of @xcite is controlled by the critical easy plane nc@xmath0model .",
    "an important point is that given the mapping of the neel field to the unit vector of the sigma model , the zeeman field considered here actually corresponds to a _ staggered _ zeeman field on the spins of ref .  .",
    "we now investigate the finite temperature properties of the nc@xmath0model ( or equivalently , the monopole suppressed o(3 ) sigma model ) , both for the isotropic as well as the easy plane case .",
    "the main result is that there is a finite temperature version of the @xmath3 phase , which we call the thermal coulomb phase @xmath180 , with power law correlations of the electric fields .",
    "this is distinct from the regular paramagnetic phase @xmath48 with short ranged correlations , and is separated from it by a finite temperature kosterlitz - thouless phase transition .",
    "the existence of such a transition can be seen from the following physical argument . in the zero temperature @xmath3 phase , there are gapped spinons that interact via a logarithmic interaction . if this interaction persists to finite temperatures , then clearly for small enough temperatures , thermal fluctuations will only generate neutral spinon pairs .",
    "this is the @xmath181 phase .",
    "however , at some higher temperature it becomes entropically favourable to proliferate unbound spinons ( exactly as with logarithmically interacting vortices in the two dimensional xy model ) and a kosterlitz - thouless type transition to a spinon - plasma phase will be expected .",
    "indeed , for the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model , the existence of such a finite temperature transition may be viewed as evidence for the existence of emergent gauge charged objects interacting via a coulomb potential , that happens to be logarithmic in two spatial dimensions which gives rise to the transition .     on the nc@xmath0model .",
    "( a ) isotropic case : the thermal coulomb phase @xmath181 , a finite temperature analogue of @xmath3 , has power law electric field correlations ( eq . [ efield ] ) and is separated from the more conventional @xmath48 phase by a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition .",
    "this can be understood as the thermal ionization of spinons interacting via the 2d coulomb ( log ) potential .",
    "the @xmath100 phase is disordered at any finite temperature .",
    "( b ) easy plane case : the ordered phase now has algebraic correlations at finite temperature ( @xmath182 ) which is also separated from the @xmath48 phase by a kt transition . , width=345 ]    -2 mm    we now sketch a derivation of these results - we choose to do this in a model with a single species of ` spinon ' or gauge charged particle . treating this single component ( or noncompact @xmath183 ) model",
    "will simplify the discussion and the very same results hold for the models of interest , i.e. the isotropic and easy - plane nc@xmath0models , because it is only the logarithmic binding / unbinding of the gauge charged objects that matters .",
    "since the finite temperature physics described above occurs in the charge and electric field sector , it will be useful to consider writing the thermal partition function @xmath184 in terms of the zero matsubara frequency components of these fields .",
    "the appropriate effective energy is : @xmath185 where @xmath44 and @xmath186 run over the sites and directions of the two dimensional spatial lattice .",
    "the partition function involves a sum over all configurations of the integer charge fields @xmath187 and _ real _ electric fields @xmath188 ( since we are working with a noncompact gauge theory ) that satisfy the gauss law constraint @xmath189 at each site of the lattice .",
    "note that the boson number and electric field variables that we use here are conjugate to the phase and gauge potential variables that have been used so far ( cf .  eqs .",
    "[ noncompact],[sep ] ) .",
    "our treatment here is precise in the regime where the total hamiltonian is dominated by the exhibited @xmath190 part , but is also valid more generally in the effective sense .",
    "the gauss law constraint can be implemented using a lagrange multiplier @xmath191 to give the following expression for the partition function : @xmath192 \\ , \\int [ da_0 ]   e^{- \\beta e\\{n_r , e_{r\\mu}\\ } + i \\sum a_0({\\bm \\delta}\\cdot { \\bf e}-n ) } ~.\\ ] ] to establish that there is a thermal transition , we integrate out the fields @xmath193 , so the partition weight is now just a function of the integer charges .",
    "this yields : @xmath194 where for large separation the potential between charges takes the form @xmath195 , which is the coulomb interaction in two dimensions .",
    "it is well known that such a coulomb gas has two phases , one with the charges bound into neutral pairs at low temperatures , and a plasma phase at high temperatures separated by a kt transition which occurs at @xmath196 .",
    "this is not surprising since we know that nc@xmath183 model is dual to the o(2 ) quantum rotor model in two spatial dimensions , and the spinons of the nc@xmath183 map onto the vortices of the o(2 ) rotor model , which interact logarithmically .",
    "a sharp distinction between the low and high temperature paramagnetic phases can be drawn by looking at the electric field correlators . in the low ( but nonzero ) temperature @xmath181 phase , these fall off as the inverse square of the distance , while in the high temperature ` spinon plasma ' phase @xmath48 , these correlators are short ranged : @xmath197 where the indices @xmath198 . as shown elsewhere",
    "@xcite , exactly the same results are obtained for the isotropic nc@xmath0model , and the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ finitet]a .",
    "in particular , despite the presence of a global su(2 ) symmetry , the transition remains kt .",
    "for the easy plane nc@xmath0model , the expected finite temperature phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ finitet]b . here , besides the discussed @xmath181 and @xmath48 phases , there is also a power law phase ( @xmath182 ) that appears out of the zero - temperature ferromagnetically ordered phase and terminates at the usual kt transition to the @xmath48 phase .",
    "again , the similarity between the @xmath181 and @xmath182 sides of this phase diagram have to do with the self duality of the underlying easy - plane nc@xmath0model .",
    "all of the preceding discussion was focused on the d=2 + 1 dimensional system where complete hedgehog suppression was required in order to obtain the deconfined phase .",
    "it is natural to ask whether similar physics can be obtained in models with only a finite energy cost for hedgehogs .",
    "this can occur in the presence of critical bosonic fields as argued in @xcite leading to deconfined quantum criticality in d=2 + 1 dimensional systems .",
    "another way in which a deconfined phase can be stabilized with a finite hedgehog fugacity is to consider d=3 + 1 dimensional systems .",
    "now , the hedgehog is a particle , and a finite hedgehog fugacity does not necessarily destabilize the coulomb phase .",
    "thus , in principle one could obtain a d=3 + 1 u(1 ) deconfined phase with global su(2 ) symmetry , by disordering the o(3 ) sigma model with a sufficiently large but finite hedgehog core energy .",
    "this question is currently under investigation ; the obvious extensions of the presented d=2 + 1 dimensional realization either led to ferromagnetic order or to the conventional paramagnet .",
    "an interesting possibility that we remark upon is a layered system that lives in three spatial dimensions , where each layer realizes the d=2 + 1 dimensional deconfined phase .",
    "such a phase exhibits _ quantum confinement _ in that the gauge charged spinons can move freely within a layer but not between the layers , and the photon remains a d=2 + 1 dimensional particle .",
    "this is reminiscent of the sliding luttinger liquid phase @xcite of coupled one dimensional systems that also exhibits the phenomenon of quantum confinement , and has a low energy phonon excitation ( which is the analogue of the photon in this lower dimensional system ) .",
    "we conclude by highlighting the main results of this work . we considered the question of whether the o(3 ) sigma model can be disordered without monopoles , and answered it in affirmative .",
    "we provided an explicit example of an o(3 ) heisenberg spin system with no free hedgehogs and no magnetic order in ( 2 + 1)d . while this is in agreement with the earlier work of kamal and murthy@xcite ,",
    "the potentially problematic features of the procedure adopted in that work have been entirely avoided in the present paper .",
    "furthermore , we identified the proper description of the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model which involves spinons coupled to a noncompact gauge field , which may be called the _",
    "noncompact _ @xmath0model .",
    "thus the hidden topological order resulting from hedgehog suppression gives rise to a photon - like low energy excitation in the paramagnetic ( @xmath3 ) phase of this model , which leads to power law correlations of the spin chirality .",
    "this may also be viewed as an example of a u(1 ) fractionalized phase ( albeit with complete monopole suppression ) with full su(2 ) spin rotation symmetry .",
    "our understanding of the hedgehog suppressed disordered sigma model is interesting from the statistical mechanics point of view and addresses some long standing questions . in a sense , we identified how to `` decompose '' the o(3 ) model into a part that involves the topological defects ( hedgehogs ) , and the part which does not involve these .",
    "such decomposition of the o(2 ) model into the vortex and spin wave parts is well known . the corresponding `` spin wave ''",
    "part for the o(3 ) model turns out to be the nc@xmath0model , which clearly has little to do with spin waves .",
    "in particular , the commonly asked question whether the spin waves ( perhaps non - linearly coupled ) can disorder the o(3 ) model seems to have no meaning .",
    "another question has been on the role played by the hedgehog defects at the heisenberg transition .",
    "a sharp formulation of this question is whether the ordering transition in the hedgehog suppressed model is identical to the heisenberg transition .",
    "our calculations of the universal critical exponents for this transition ( @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) show that it is indeed distinct from the heisenberg transition .",
    "direct simulation of the nc@xmath0model however yields exponents that are consistent with these .",
    "moreover , the large @xmath108 of the vector ( magnon ) field implied by these exponents can be heuristically understood since the magnon can decay into a pair of unconfined spinons at this critical point .",
    "thus , an important conceptual issue that is clarified by our work is the existence of two different spin rotation symmetric critical points in d=2 + 1 .",
    "the first is the heisenberg transition whose ` soft spin ' field theory is given by the o(3 ) @xmath201 theory .",
    "this describes of course the transition in the o(3 ) sigma model if it is regularized by putting the spins on the lattice .",
    "it also describes the transition in the lattice @xmath0model with a _ compact _ gauge field .",
    "the second transition is described by a ` soft spin ' field theory with a pair of complex scalar fields ( that transform as spinors under spin rotations ) , coupled to a _",
    "noncompact _ gauge field .",
    "this describes the ordering transition of the lattice o(3 ) sigma model with hedgehog suppression .",
    "it also describes the transition in the lattice @xmath0coupled to a _",
    "noncompact _ gauge field .",
    "earlier indiscriminate use of what is effectively the nc@xmath0model to describe the heisenberg transition are therefore to be reconsidered .",
    "we also studied various physical extensions of the hedgehog suppressed o(3 ) model , such as adding zeeman field and also the effect of finite temperature .",
    "the @xmath3 phase survives in small external magnetic field and retains the photon , which is an evidence for gapped spinons . at finite temperatures ,",
    "a thermal coulomb phase with long ranged power law electric field correlations exists , and undergoes a kosterlitz - thouless transition to the usual paramagnetic phase at higher temperatures ; this is indirect evidence for gauge charge carrying particles ( spinons ) that interact via the coulomb potential which is logarithmic in 2d .",
    "an interesting extension is obtained by breaking the full rotation symmetry down to the easy - plane xy symmetry .",
    "we showed that this model possesses a remarkable ` self - duality ' property . indeed",
    "as far as we know this is the first purely bosonic model in d=2 + 1 that displays this property .",
    "in particular the critical point describing the ordering transition in this model is self - dual .",
    "an important role is played by this critical theory in a forthcoming publication @xcite , where it is conjectured that this critical point may already have been seen in numerical experiments on easy plane spin half quantum antiferromagnet on the square lattice where surprisingly a continuous transition is observed between a spin ordered state and a valence bond solid that breaks lattice symmetries @xcite .    in d=2 +",
    "1 the @xmath3 phase and its gapless photon excitation only exist in the limit of infinite hedgehog suppression .",
    "thus , within this phase , the complete suppression of free hedgehogs represents an extreme limit that may seem unnatural .",
    "however , reasoning in this limit can be conceptually powerful and throw light on many tricky issues . besides , we note that even if hedgehogs eventually proliferate and lead to a gap for the photon , this @xmath3 phase may be relevant for describing physical crossovers in some strongly correlated systems at energy scales above the photon mass .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath3 phase which in the @xmath0language is unstable to turning on a finite monopole fugacity , the stability of the critical points where gapless gauge charged particles are present is a more involved question , and depends on the number of gapless fields present and the particular monopole creation operator under consideration .",
    "in fact , it is argued in @xcite that quadrupled monopole operators ( which are relevant to the spin half quantum antiferromagnets on the square lattice ) are irrelevant at the nc@xmath0critical point in both the isotropic and easy plane limits .",
    "this would allow for a continuous transitions between valence bond solid and neel phases in such systems , and these transitions would be controlled by the critical points studied in this paper .",
    "finally , we expect a similar @xmath3 phase in the ( 3 + 1)d o(3 ) model , which will now be present also with strong but finite monopole suppression , which would provide a spin rotation invariant ( 3 + 1)d model which exhibits a fractionalized coulomb phase with deconfined spinons and a true photon excitation .",
