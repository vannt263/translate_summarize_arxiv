    ".    what consequences may we expect from higher loop calculations ?",
    "let us consider the two diagrams relevant for goldstone damping shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : goldstdamp ] .",
    "the imaginary part of diagram _ a ) _ corresponds to the physical process @xmath2 , where all the particles are on mass shell and @xmath3 comes from the heat bath . in this process , if @xmath4 then @xmath5 must go to infinity in order to satisfy the mass - shell relations .",

    "we will have larger phase space for the processes contributing to the damping which will increase the damping rates .",
    "this effect can be the most dramatic in those cases , where the one loop damping rate is small , as in the case of long wavelength goldstone modes @xcite .",
    "the other effect we can expect is due to the decay of the intermediate particles . at one loop level the intermediate particles are stable , but higher loops account also for their own damping , what is another way of interpreting in diagram _",
    "b ) _ the inner blob .",
    "that means that there is a finite range in time , where the interactions are effective .",
    "in general this may lead to `` loss - of - memory '' effects for time scales beyond the typical inverse damping rates ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "i would like to take into account the dynamical effects of a subset of higher loop diagrams by summing up self - consistently the real time self - energy functions ( section 2 ) .",
    "the resulting generalized gap equations are solved in the quasi - particle ( breit - wigner ) approximation ( section 3 ) .",
    "the results are applied to the calculation of goldstone and higgs landau damping and , in particular , the goldstone on - shell damping rate , at frequencies much smaller than the width parameters of the resulting breit - wigner shapes ( section 4 ) .",
    "the conclusions of the investigation are summarized in section 5 where also some important questions left for future studies are discussed . some formal tool used for obtaining results of the main text",
    "are presented in an appendix .",
    "the lagrangian of the model of our investigation is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents a vector in the n - dimensional space @xmath11 . in the symmetry broken phase , where @xmath12 , the field has a non - vanishing expectation value @xmath13const , which can be chosen to point in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "we introduce a new field @xmath15 , and the lagrangian takes the form @xmath16 where the tadpole terms are @xmath17 and the kinetic term is determined by the kernel @xmath18 we will omit from the lagrangian the purely background dependent and tadpole terms in the sequel .",
    "it is well known that the negative mass squared leads to ir instabilities , which appear also in static quantities , for example as a complex free energy density for small @xmath19 s . in order to avoid these effects",
    "one has to resum the perturbation series , which allows for the use of the physical mass in the propagators @xcite .",
    "a consistent method of static resummation consists of introducing thermal counterterms @xmath20 where the last term is also treated as interaction .",
    "the determination of the thermal mass can be done with help of gap equations : the masses ( for example @xmath21 ) are stable against loop corrections @xcite .",
    "since the thermal counterterm preserves @xmath22 symmetry the goldstone theorem ensures the masslessness of the goldstone bosons in the broken symmetry case ( also at finite temperature @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "the higgs mass calculated from the tree level and one loop formulae should coincide .",
    "these requirements lead to @xmath23 these are two equations for the two quantities @xmath19 and @xmath24 . in more complicated cases ( especially in gauge theories )",
    "we can rearrange the perturbation theory in a momentum dependent way @xcite .    in dynamical systems",
    "there are more scales than in the static case . in the @xmath22 model besides the temperature ( @xmath25 ) and the debye mass ( @xmath26 ) there appear the on - shell damping rates for the higgs and goldstone bosons ( @xmath27 ) . especially in the goldstone case",
    ", where the debye scale is missing ( @xmath28 ) can the damping play an important role . also at low external momenta ( both @xmath29 and @xmath5 falling for instance into the range of landau damping )",
    "these scales may have an impact on the results .",
    "therefore it is worth to work out a consistent method for the incorporation of the damping scales into the resummation .",
    "on - shell damping arises when the mass shell falls on some cut of the propagator .",
    "the cuts give momentum dependent contribution to the self - energy , which suggest to work with a momentum dependent resummation scheme @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the counterterm has to preserve @xmath22 symmetry at least for the zero momentum modes in order to be able to satisfy the requirements @xmath32 and @xmath33 simultaneously to all orders of the resummed perturbation theory .",
    "it also has to maintain @xmath34 symmetry of the goldstone modes for all momenta .",
    "at finite temperature in the real time formalism one works with several propagators ( @xmath35 ) , and we have to relate them to the kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "the most comfortable way to do this is first to express the spectral function @xmath36}\\right\\rangle}$ ] in momentum space .",
    "it is diagonal @xmath37 , and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the shorthand notation for @xmath40 , and similarly for @xmath41 .",

    "the @xmath34 symmetry of the goldstone bosons ensures the @xmath42-independence of @xmath43 .",

    "it is sufficient to add and subtract from the original lagrangian a piece of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the original lagrangian does not change , but , if we take into account the two pieces at different loop orders of the perturbation theory , their contributions break the @xmath22 symmetry at each level . at tree level",
    "the goldstone mass is not affected , but in the second term of ( [ ph1exv ] ) leads to the substitution @xmath69 . at one loop",
    "the compatibility of @xmath32 and @xmath28 is fulfilled if @xmath70 which determines @xmath71 . keeping this in mind we omit vertex resummation , since it has no effect up to the order of the perturbation theory which is considered .    introducing the notations @xmath72 ( @xmath73 , as can be easily checked ,",
    "is the one - loop corrected coupling ) we have the relations @xmath74 therefore to the given order we can substitute @xmath75 by @xmath76 .    for the optimization of the time - dependent perturbation theory we can use the same ideas as in the static thermal counterterm case : we demand that the one loop propagator be identical with the tree level one for all momenta . implementing this requirement in the schwinger - dyson form for the inverse propagator @xmath77 yields @xmath78 ie .",
    "the dynamical counterterm is the self - energy calculated using the one - loop exact propagator .",
    "earlier we have determined the expressions for the retarded self - energies as functionals of the spectral functions , and also the spectral function is expressed through the kinetic term @xmath79 .",
    "thus we can write down a complete set of renormalized functional equations @xmath80 where @xmath24 comes from eq .",
    "( [ bpmh ] ) .",
    "this set of functional equations can be , in principle , solved .",
    "their construction represents the main conceptual result of our investigation .",
    "now , we shall proceed with developing practical approximation schemes applicable to these equations .",
    "we can simplify the solution of our gap equations in ( [ gapeq ] ) with some assumptions .",
    "the most severe is the quasi - particle approximation , that is we assume that numerically the most important contribution comes from a narrow region around the mass shell @xmath81 of the spectral function ( cf .",
    "this assumption means that we take into account only those effects which stem from the resonant broadening of the mass - shell . if contributions coming from the momentum ranges of the spectral function which are far from the single particle mass shell prove to be important , then our breit - wigner approximation is not valid any more",
    ". a useful characteristics of the actual situation is the value of the wave function renormalization constant @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "if its value is far from 1 , the quasi - particle approximation fails , while for @xmath83 we can hope that we are on the right track .",
    "formally this assumption corresponds to the breit - wigner approximation to @xmath84 , with @xmath85 independent on @xmath29 . for @xmath86 we can write @xmath87 where @xmath88 will be approximated by the mass - shell relation as @xmath89 @xmath90 standing for the resummed masses ( cf .",
    "( [ massresum ] ) ) , ie .",
    "we neglect the momentum dependent real part of the self - energies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath91 is a smeared out delta function , where the on - shell damping rates @xmath92 yield the width of the functions . in the free case",
    "we get back to the usual expression @xmath93 under these approximations we can simplify the gap equations using instead of the last two equations of ( [ gapeq ] ) eq .",
    "( [ bwrho ] ) with the usual form of the on - shell damping @xmath94    as a further approximation we treat @xmath95 acting on any function smooth around the mass shell as an ordinary dirac - delta distribution .",
    "this is appropriate if the rate of variation of the smooth function is slower than ( or at least comparable with ) @xmath96 . since @xmath96 is the smallest scale in the system ( @xmath97 ) we can apply it in many cases .",
    "if we substitute the bose distribution with its on - shell value , @xmath49 turns out to be @xmath96-independent @xmath98.\\ ] ] for the computation of @xmath50 we introduce the notations @xmath99 which allows us to write ( cf .",

    "@xmath105 behaves almost like an ordinary dirac - delta in this case , but its width is added to the imaginary part of the denominator .",
    "the same formula can be applied again to the @xmath106 integration , and finally we arrive at @xmath107 , \\label{sgam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 .",
    "the result formally corresponds to changing the imaginary piece @xmath109 in the perturbative denominators to @xmath110 , which has the physical content of replacing the adiabatic switching off the interactions by the effect of the particle decay .",
    "this leads to the realization of our conjecture in the introduction , namely the loss - of - memory effects .",
    "after a time @xmath111 the interactions become ineffective and we can expect in the time evolution of any physical quantity the appearance of effectively localized ( instead of long tail ) kernels .",
    "the other expected effect , the larger available phase space of final states contributing to quasi - particle damping will be demonstrated via the actual calculation of the imaginary parts . from eq .",

    "this shows the other expected effect conjectured in the introduction , the enlarged phase space contributing to the damping , since @xmath132 is a smeared version of @xmath133 .",
    "next we present some direct consequences of the application of eq.([imsab ] ) .      if the coefficient of @xmath27 in the perturbative expression of the damping rate is @xmath134 , then the corrections from the finite width are negligible , or more precisely they can not be assessed reliably from the present approximation . in these cases the higgs mass is the relevant scale which determines the damping rates , the finite width plays only subleading role . as an example",
    "let us take the on - shell damping of the higgs component .",
    "this phenomenon is the result of the decay of the higgs boson into two goldstone bosons in the zero width case .",
    "now we want take into account the effect of broadening of the resonances in this process . using ( [ gammagap ] ) , ( [ impirs ] ) and the first line of ( [ imsab ] )",

    "the difference can be tracked back to the neighborhood of the @xmath145 lower limit of the integration , which yields @xmath146 .",
    "after closer inspection of the two - particle cut contributions to this process , it can be seen that the far off shell contributions ( for example the ones coming from @xmath147 ) are of the same order of magnitude . as a consequence we can not give the correction to the one - loop result for @xmath148 , as it was stated above .",

    "moreover , for large @xmath124 , @xmath158 , remains smaller than @xmath159 .",
    "assuming that this region dominates the integral ( to be confirmed a posteriori ) we neglect @xmath160 in the denominator and write @xmath161 the integrand receives contribution from momenta @xmath162 , therefore the starting assumption was correct . approximating @xmath160 by a constant , the integral",
    "can be performed @xmath163 here @xmath164 must be taken at the dominating value of the momentum @xmath165 .",
    "our notation emphasizes that a viscosity term has appeared , similar to the one observed in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "according to our result the viscosity coefficient @xmath166 is proportional to @xmath167 , the quasi - particle damping about @xmath25 .",
    "the above formula also says that long wavelength goldstone modes are damped in contrary to the zero width result , and @xmath168 if we take for @xmath160 only the higgs contribution , as calculated from perturbation theory @xcite @xmath169      landau damping of the higgs fluctuation modes in the usual perturbation theory comes from the @xmath170 contributions of @xmath147 and @xmath171 .",
    "we now examine their modification due to the finite lifetime of quasi - particles .",
    "first let us consider @xmath147 .",
    "we will apply high temperature expansion on the results . more precisely in the last two lines in eq .",
    "( [ imsab ] ) we assume @xmath172 , thus neglect masses and @xmath173 .",

    ", however , the range of effect in @xmath29 might broaden .",
    "the landau damping part of @xmath177 then reads @xmath178 the smooth difference @xmath179 enhances contributions from small momenta",

    "( [ gamma1 ] ) ) @xmath182    then high temperature expansion yields @xmath183 this is the zero width result simply modified by the substitution @xmath184 .    in case of the landau damping contribution from @xmath185 the situation is complicated by ir divergences . to be on the safe side",
    "we introduce there an ir cutoff @xmath186 , and use cut bose - einstein distributions @xcite @xmath187 the result of the calculation is thereafter interpreted as induced self - energies for an effective model for modes below the cutoff @xcite .",

    "we expect , on general grounds , two types of effects .",
    "the first is the result of the larger available phase space for the processes contributing to the damping which increase the physical damping rates .",
    "the other effect is due to the instability of intermediate particles which lead to loss - of memory effects .",

    "other on - shell damping rates which in the perturbation theory are proportional to @xmath27 with a coefficient of @xmath134 receive @xmath202 correction , which is , however , beyond the scope of the present approximation .",

    ". probably this puzzle can be resolved by a resummation of a subset of vertex diagrams , similarly to the resummation in the @xmath204 theory @xcite which leads to an important modification in the viscosity coefficients .",
