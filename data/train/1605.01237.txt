    "finally , details on the derivation of the effective interaction energy between the domain walls are presented .      for the numerical quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations we implemented the cluster stochastic series expansion method @xcite by taking into account three sites as the update unit , as it can help increasing the ergodicity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that qmc may have an infamous minus sign problem if an exchange of two fermions is possible , or if a kinetic frustration occurs , i.e.  the overall probability of an off - diagonal exchange along a closed loop is negative . since we are dealing with bosons with positive hopping our model is without sign problem , despite the triangular geometry .",
    "however , another typical qmc problem of trapping in a local minimum is indeed of concern for our studies . in particular",
    ", the domain walls in the incommensurate supersolid phase represent very robust topological defects , so the system may get trapped at a fixed domain wall number , which is difficult to change with a small hopping parameter even using the loop update . in addition , because the wave functions with different domain wall numbers have nearly no overlap , also ordinary parallel tempering @xcite does not show much improvement . in order to solve this local minimum problem ,",
    "a further extension of the parallel tempering method has been developed . to this end",
    "we perform the normal qmc simulation in the whole parameter region first and store the configuration at each point .",
    "then , for each parameter point , we use the outcome of neighboring parameter points as the initial configuration and launch additional simulations .",
    "when they are finished , we choose the simulation with the lowest average energy as the right one since at low temperatures we are effectively in the ground state limit .",
    "we find that without this change of initial configurations the resulting energy curve is discontinuous as a function of parameters , but it becomes continuous after the swap . only for",

    "figure [ l12_rho ] ( a ) shows that the steps are very clearly visible in the strong - coupling region at @xmath108 , but relaxation of the plateaus is observed when the hopping is increased to @xmath109 .",

    "one of the main results in the paper is that each plateau of the domain wall density is closely related to a corresponding maximum of the structure factor . in order to make this connection clearer , we plot the structure factor @xmath90 in @xmath110-direction for @xmath111 using values of @xmath40 in the center of the corresponding domain wall plateau in fig .",

    "the positions of the peaks match well with the analytic prediction @xmath112 .     as function of @xmath110 at @xmath111 for different domain wall densities ( shifted relative to each other ) at @xmath92 , @xmath51 , and @xmath113 .",

    "this implies that the shift of the structure factor is also continuous at the phase transition , indicating a second - order phase transition . to give additional support we present the finite - size scaling of the superfluid density difference between the two phases at @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ eta0_ffs_rhos ] .",
    "clearly , the second - order polynomial fit shows that the jump also vanishes in the thermodynamic limit for this order parameter , which confirms that the phase transition is of second order .        whereas so far we have chosen periodic boundary conditions , we investigate now cylindrical boundary conditions ( @xmath13-cbc ) with open ends in @xmath12-direction . in that case",
