    "phase transitions play an important role in the study of physical systems under extreme conditions . in particle physics , various kinds of phase transitions are of interest and the use of equilibrium thermodynamics may be inadequate .",
    "for example , this is so in the current descriptions of the initial stages of heavy ion collisions , in which , heuristically , the onset of deconfinement is believed to give rise to the formation of a quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "two further examples that one may speculate upon , are the electroweak phase transition in the early universe @xcite , and the formation of disaligned chiral condensates ( dcc ) in high energy hadronic collisions @xcite , such as @xmath2 scattering",
    ".    the closed timepath ( ctp ) formalism , originating from the work of schwinger @xcite , keldysh @xcite , and vernon and feynman @xcite , is suitable for analyzing non - equilibrium systems .",
    "it takes one beyond the more conventional approaches used to describe small perturbations about thermal equilibrium , such as thermo field dynamics @xcite , the niemi - semenoff methods @xcite and the real time finite temperature formalism of dolan and jackiw @xcite .",
    "the ctp formalism is not restricted to quasi homogeneous systems close to equilibrium , although in practice , to date , it has been difficult to implement non - equilibrium theory in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the full power of the ctp formalism is unfolded within the functional integral representation @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite an effective action principle , that leads to a hierarchy of schwinger - dyson equations for the green functions , has been formulated .",
    "these equations can be reformulated in terms of a transport theory , or kinetic field theory , for the 2-point functions .",
    "such a field theoretic formalism can be shown to have a boltzmann equation as its quasi - classical limit @xcite .",
    "while the ctp non equilibrium formalism is theoretically aesthetic and complete , it is difficult to implement practically , and has only recently become a subject of detailed study .",
    "transport theories in general constitute a topic whose quantum field theoretic content is difficult to understand on the basis of quasi - classical models .",
    "we briefly summarize some applications of transport theory that have been developed and are currently of interest .",
    "we do so without attempting to be complete .",
    "non - relativistic kinetic equations have become a common tool in analyzing heavy ion collisions numerically @xcite .",
    "semi - classical , but relativistic , approaches based on quantum hadron dynamics have been put forward for the same purpose @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been done on the formulation of a quark - gluon transport theory based on the operator formalism of quantum field theory @xcite . in order to study the restoration of chiral symmetry in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "a transport theory for the nambu - jona - lasinio model , that contains quarks as its fundamental degrees of freedom , has been derived in the framework of the ctp formalism @xcite . due to the difficulties",
    "inherent in this particular problem the equations of motion that are obtained have however only been solved in the mean field approximation , in order to study the influence of the phase transition on the expansion of a qgp @xcite , and the fluctuations in a quark - antiquark plasma @xcite .",
    "the ctp formalism has also been recently applied @xcite to the o(4 ) linear sigma model to investigate dcc formation . in all of the studies that have been mentioned ,",
    "the systems have been required to be quasi uniform and/or the particles to be on mass - shell .",
    "these restrictions have simply been necessitated by the dificulty of the problem at hand , since they give rise to considerable simplifications in the formalism when applied .",
    "on the other hand , the lifting of these requirements may in some cases be important .",
    "the mass - shell restriction may suppress important quantum effects .",
    "this is illustrated in the calculation of eisenberg @xcite showing that the spontaneous creation of particles from a constant background field can not be described in this way .    in order to obtain a better understanding of the importance of off - shell behaviour and spatial inhomogeneities , it is useful to examine a simple model . to this end , we shall focus on the well - known scalar @xmath1 model in this paper and study the ctp formalism and associated transport theory for this model . in doing so we shall endeavour to remove the on - shell restriction , and also investigate a scenario which is far from equilibrium . of technical importance is the proof that energy and momentum are conserved in the presence of interactions , which we also demonstrate .    since our analysis is performed in the setting of kinetic theory",
    ", we discuss this briefly here .",
    "if interactions are short ranged , as is the case for the @xmath1 point - like interaction , one expects naively that the quantum field may , above some length - scale @xmath3 , be conceived as a distribution of free particles , each of which temporarily goes off - shell while undergoing an interaction , during a time @xmath4 . for this picture to have some validity",
    ", one has @xmath5 in that case , the time dependent particle density @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 in describing the system . due to particle creation and annihilation @xmath6",
    "will , in general , have a time dependent normalization .",
    "this separation of the system into macroscopic length scales above @xmath3 , and microscopic length scales below @xmath3 , is at the same time a statement about the effective interaction , and hence the effective coupling of the particles at different energy scales .",
    "it is therefore important to consider the behavior of the running coupling as we move from one length scale to another .",
    "for example , in qcd at high energies , the quark and gluon degrees of freedom are relevant , whereas at low energies these remain confined and their hadronic bound states can be treated as fundamental . in this case , the separation in length scales is accompanied by a separation of physical degrees of freedom .",
    "such a phenomenon is difficult to implement in a two - scale transport theory .",
    "a two - scale approach is also not consistent with the running of the effective coupling in the @xmath0 model .",
    "here we are dealing with a trivial theory .",
    "if we take the quantum corrections of all scales into account , the effective coupling in the theory vanishes , implying that small scale dynamics fundamentally modify the behavior at larger scales .",
    "imposing a momentum space cut off in the theory invalidates triviality and the theory becomes interacting .",
    "a kinetic formalism can be derived from the closed time path formalism without resorting to a two - scale interpretation .",
    "however the resulting equations of motion that one obtains are kinetic equations for the 2 point green functions , rather than for a quasi - classical phase - space distribution function .",
    "a kinetic theory for the @xmath0 model was originally derived via the operator formalism in the mid - seventies @xcite .",
    "we study the kinetic field theory for the aforementioned model by reformulating the ctp equations of motion as a transport theory , and including up to 4-point initial correlations .",
    "a similar approach can be found in @xcite , where however only initial two - point correlations have been taken into account . in section two",
    ", we give a brief introduction to the ctp formalism in this context , derive the transport equations , and clarify their physical content .",
    "our view parallels the physical interpretation put forward in the early work by carruthers and zachariasen @xcite .",
    "initial conditions for these equations are shown to break a symmetry underlying _ any _ ctp field theory in the third section .",
    "the ward - takahashi identities corresponding to this broken symmetry express direct relationships between the green functions and the initial conditions .",
    "they also represent a set of kinetic equations generalized to the n - point green functions . for the @xmath1 model ,",
    "in which the symmetry group is so(1,1 ) , these identities are given .",
    "in particular , the noether current corresponding to this symmetry is interpreted physically .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the dynamical evolution of the 2-point functions guarantees energy - momentum conservation . in the fourth section",
    "we detail this explicitly by demonstrating that the divergence of the energy- momentum tensor vanishes simply by using the transport equations .",
    "this allows us to settle some of the questions concerning energy - momentum conservation and the use of gradient - expansions in both vlasov equations , and equations that include a collision - term . by studying the off - shell behavior in the free field equations and recovering the casimir - effect from our solutions ,",
    "we illustrate the intimate connection between inhomogeneities , off - shellness and initial conditions . with this program in mind",
    ", we now give a brief exposition of the ctp formalism and the kinetic field theory that is based upon it .",
    "before we turn to the @xmath0 model in particular , we review the general structure of the ctp formalism and the generalized effective action . following this",
    ", we derive the transport equations for the 2-point functions and analyse the physical meaning of the various terms in the equations and the variables we use .      here",
    "we will briefly recapitulate the main ideas of the ctp formalism that are relevant for our calculation .",
    "a full treatment of the ctp formalism can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 denote a collection of field operators . for simplicity , we take them to be bosonic .",
    "the system is specified by a lagrangian density @xmath9 , and a density operator @xmath10 , that enforces the initial conditions .",
    "let @xmath11 be an eigenstate of the @xmath8 operator satisfying @xmath12 with the c - number function @xmath13 being one of its eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath14 be a complete set .",

    "\\label{eq : dens}\\ ] ] contains all the physical information stored in the density operator at t=0 .",
    "square brackets denote @xmath16 being a functional rather than a funtion .",
    "if the hamiltonian @xmath17 of the system is not time dependent then , in the heisenberg picture , neither will the operator @xmath10 be .",
    "if we now introduce an additional interaction with a source @xmath18 @xmath19 then the time dependence of @xmath10 is given by @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\   &    & \\times \\ \\hat{\\rho } ( t=0 ) \\",

    "it is a useful bookkeeping device to introduce indices 1 and 2 for the current and field operators taken on the time ordered or anti time ordered paths respectively , that are given in eq.([eq : densti ] ) .",

    "the field carrying negative temporal charge @xmath184 vanishes .",
    "the field - operator @xmath182 creates a symmetric state out of the vacuum , representing a physical particle .",

    "they represent respectively the outgoing and the incoming particles . in terms of these functions",
    "we can write @xmath187 showing that the temporal current is directly related to the absorptive part of the 2-point green function @xcite .",

    "however such questions can be addressed by constructing appropriate wave - packets .",
    "the commutation relation eq.([eq : com ] ) expresses that if one integrates out the energy - flow , then @xmath156 .",
    "put differently , the momentum is lost to other particles with different energies but it is not destroyed . the temporal current is the total flow of the creation/ annihilation density in terms of either a location , @xmath190 , or the energy - momentum dissipation @xmath191 . in detailed balance , the vacuum subtracted flow will be zero . the total temporal charge @xmath192 at time t is the total creation/ annihilation amplitude .",

    "the actual green function can be decomposed however to display the form @xmath201 where one sees that the third term explicitly breaks so(1,1 ) symmetry . a proper definition of the non - equilibrium theory , i.e. fixing the initial conditions , also requires the symmetry to be broken .      for the sake of simplicity , we examine the symmetry breaking by a 2-point kernel @xmath202 .",
    "this covers both equilibrium and non - equilibrium initial conditions , that describe an inhomogeneous system of free bosons .",

    "so far we have discussed the expectation values of the so(1,1 ) current operator .",

    "the self - interaction also breaks the symmetry and we will deal with that next .",
    "the divergence in the temporal current due to interactions is @xmath220 this explicit symmetry breaking ( esb ) is local and therefore persistent , unlike the case discussed above .",
    "a simple example of the violation of particle number by interactions is the decay of one boson into three bosons .",
    "note that eq.([eq : div2 ] ) is just the @xmath221 integrated kinetic equation for @xmath222 .",
    "the integrated vlasov- and collision terms can all be recovered from eq.([eq : div2 ] ) , and interpreted along the lines of ( off - shell ) particle creation and annihilation in the vacuum of the interacting theory .    for esb",

    "the broken so(1,1 ) symmetry generates a hierarchy of equations for the green functions .",
    "the generalization of eq.([eq : ward1 ] ) and eq.([eq : ward2 ] ) to higher - order kernels @xmath50 and other polynomial interactions is straightforward .",
    "in this section , we show that the divergence of the canonical energy - momentum tensor vanishes due to the kinetic and constraint equations . it will turn out that the true difference between vlasov- and collision - terms lies in the ( non-)locality of the interactions that they represent .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor in the @xmath0 model is given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 refers to the free field energy - momentum tensor and @xmath231 to the interacting part . in terms of 2-point functions",

    "have been dropped , because they do not contribute to the integral since @xmath235 is symmetric in @xmath234 . the interaction contribution to the energy momentum tensor",
    "is connected with the coincidence limit of the four point green functions .",
    "one possible choice is @xmath236 it is important to recognize that the interaction part also contains the contribution of the _ independent _ variable @xmath94 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation requires @xmath237 we will investigate this relation for three cases . first we will consider the free field situation , followed by a verification of eq.([eq : emc ] ) taking into account the vlasov interaction and , finally , treating the full theory .",
    "our procedure will be to use the kinetic and constraint equations to calculate the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : emc ] ) from eq.([eq : gem ] ) and conclude the equality with the r.h.s . of eq.([eq",
    ": emc ] ) .    for the free field case , @xmath203",
    ", the kinetic and constraint equations read @xmath238 applying @xmath239 to eq.([eq : gem ] ) , it is straightforward to see that the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : emc ] ) vanishes . in the vlasov approximation ,",
    "we neglect the collision terms , i.e. we treat the 4-point green function as a disconnected product of 2-point functions .",
    "so the interaction term is @xmath240 the factor 3 counts the possible ways of writing a 4-point green function as a disconnected product of 2-point green functions .",
    "the kinetic and constraint equations are now given as @xmath241 applying @xmath239 to eq.([eq : gem ] ) and using the vlasov equations yields @xmath242 the @xmath221-integration in the terms containing the sinh and cosh functions can be performed . for the sinh terms",
    "this yields @xmath243 to be integrated over @xmath136 and @xmath244 .",
    "for the cosh terms one can use @xmath245 these terms generate the r.h.s . of eq.([eq :",
    "emc ] ) . note that , since the vlasov term has gradient operators between a @xmath139-independent factor and @xmath124 , the gradients play no role in energy - momentum conservation .    in the fully interacting case ,",
    "the confirmation of eq.([eq : emc ] ) becomes difficult as long as we stay in @xmath189-space .",
    "substitution of eq.([eq : ke ] ) and eq.([eq : ce ] ) into the l.h.s . of eq.([eq : emc ] ) now yields @xmath246 where we have allready used the fact that the free field and vlasov terms either vanish or are taken care of by corresponding terms in the interaction part .",
    "the @xmath221-integration in eq.([eq : ab ] ) is not trivial , as it was for the vlasov term .",
    "all the gradients must be included .",
    "we do this by transforming eq.([eq : ab ] ) back to coordinate - space .",
    "there we have @xmath247 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{\\nu } } [ g_{\\ c}^{2}(y , z ) \\sigma^{c1}(z , x ) + g_{\\ c}^{1}(y , z ) \\sigma^{c1}(z , x ) ] \\ } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we can identify as the point - split implementation of the product rule by using the symmetry of the green functions under the coherent exchange of ctp indices and the corresponding space - time arguments .",
    "consequently we have the divergence of the free field energy - momentum tensor expressed in terms of the connected 4-point green function @xmath248 using eq.([eq : bc ] ) we see that eq.([eq : emc ] ) is satisfied , so that in general energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "contrary to energy - momentum conservation for the vlasov terms we required all the gradients .",
    "the physical reason for this lies in the nature of the interactions that these terms represent .",
    "the vlasov - term results from _ local _ interactions with ( off - shell ) particles from the background . the interaction vertex is the point - like @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the collision terms contain _ non - local _ interactions , like , for example , the two - boson exchange interaction .",
    "the gradients probe the locality of these interactions . neglecting gradients",
    "thus violates energy - momentum conservation , unless specific non - local interactions are added to the lagrangian density .",
    "energy - momentum conservation is guaranteed by the kinetic- and constraint equations .",
    "this points to the fact that any inhomogeneities occurring in such a field theoretic model come from a spontaneous breaking of translation invariance .",
    "a gradient - expansion violates locality if used in the collision term .",
    "a vlasov - approximation is restricted to the local response of the system to inhomogeneities .",
    "the temporal current non - conservation is a differential equation for the difference @xmath249 in the coincidence limit and energy - momentum conservation is a differential equation for the sum @xmath250 in the coincidence limit .",
    "the two equations , given apropriate boundary conditions , consequently determine the coincidence limit of the 2-point green functions .",
    "put differently , energy - momentum conservation and temporal current non - conservation determine the u.v.behaviour of the dressed propagators . in the next section we analyse a free field case in the presence of inhomogeneities .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen that energy - momentum conservation and temporal current non - conservation equations determine the coincidence limits of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "inhomogeneities have played a major role in establishing the conservation since they reflect the energy - momentum exchange between the particles .",
    "inhomogeneities on the other hand make their appearance in the gradient expansions of the interaction terms in the kinetic and constraint equations , but also they appear quadratically in the free field equations . in this section",
    "we will concentrate on the free field equations @xmath253 to find the solution to eq.([eq : fke ] ) for arbitrary initial data , we exploit the linearity of these equations .",
    "it is used to discuss the effect of inhomogeneities and off - shellness . following this we give an explicit example of an inhomogeneous non - equilibrium system .      by inspection of eq.([eq : fke ] ) one sees that the decomposition of @xmath57 into a vacuum contribution , @xmath254 , and a medium term , @xmath255 , @xmath256 solves the free field equations , where @xmath254 is @xmath257 and @xmath258 satisfies the set of homogeneous equations @xmath259 since @xmath254 describes the propagation of free particles , their @xmath140-dependence is a simple @xmath260 as expected from the absence of interactions . all the momentum - loss information is included in @xmath255 .",
    "it is the momentum - loss suffered by the particles during the preparation of the initial condition .",
    "particle propagation at later times will not couple to these initial inhomogeneities and thus not dissipate them .",

    "since we work in momentum space , it is useful to introduce the fourier transform of the initial conditions @xmath264 @xmath265 this fourier transform can also be decomposed in the fashion of eq.([eq : dd ] ) as @xmath266 .",
    "the linearity of the equations implies the solution for @xmath255 has the form @xmath267 due to the symmetry , @xmath268 , of the off - diagonal 2-point functions and the relation @xmath269 specifying the diagonal elements in terms of the off - diagonal elements , the four functions @xmath255 contain only one unknown function @xmath270 , satisfying eq.([eq : hom ] ) . in thermal equilibrium , it is well - knowm that @xmath270 is given as @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the bose - einstein distribution function .",

    "@xmath139 has only two non - vanishing elements ; @xmath282 and @xmath139 .",

    "the lorentz boost factor relates these waves to spatial oscillations in the rest - frame defined by @xmath288 .",
    "although there is no interaction among the particles , there are collective off - shell effects due to the preparation of the initial condition . in a free field theory ,",
    "particles with a pure momentum are described by plane waves .",
    "eq.([eq : genres ] ) tells us that a particle can not be in a pure momentum state if there are transversal inhomogeneities ( t.i.s ) .",
    "clearly they would disturb any plane wave into a more complex wave . from the reality condition on @xmath279 , we see that t.i.s must vanish for @xmath139 to be on - shell .",
    "the constraint @xmath289 implies that the rest - mass of the particles is unaffected by inhomogeneities .",
    "the energy - loss is solely due to longitudinal inhomogeneities ( l.i.s ) , in contrast to the t.i.s , responsible for removing the particles off the mass shell . by going to the rest frame @xmath290 of the particles moving along @xmath287",
    ", one sees that @xmath291 for non - vanishing t.i.s .",
    "this implies that the particles will not reach asymptotic on - shell states unless they were not deflected in the first place .",

    "thus we compute the initial condition for each half - space @xmath309 the total space initial condition is calculated from the functions @xmath310 according to eq.([eq : def ] ) . the product with the step functions in coordinate space becomes a convolution in momentum space .",
