    "ion trap precision spectroscopy has led the way to implement quantum algorithms  @xcite , test fundamental symmetries of nature  @xcite , trace element analysis  @xcite , isotope separation  @xcite _ etc._. in each of these experiments an essential component has been a stable laser to probe atomic or molecular transition .",
    "stability of a laser is judged by its emission bandwidth as well as slow drift of its wavelength .",
    "the emission bandwidth is narrowed by locking to high finesse optical cavity which can currently achieve sub - hz linewidth in short time scales  @xcite .",
    "however the emission wavelength of the laser locked to a cavity can drift due to ambient temperature fluctuation , low frequency mechanical vibrations _",
    "etc._. there has been tremendous development in building ultra - stable reference cavities which can restrict these drifts below khz / day  @xcite . an alternative method to restrict the drift",
    "is to actively lock the laser to known frequency reference of an atom or molecule . particularly for experiments which require extended period of data aquisition , active locking to atomic or molecular reference",
    "is preferred due to their robustness . furthermore to avoid complexity in the experimental setup it is preferred to have the same atomic / molecular reference cell for all involved transitions .",
    "however , this is not always possible due to lack of suitable transitions in a single atom or molecule .",
    "mostly iodine dimers and tellurium dimers are used as choice of reference apart from hollow cathode lamps for different elements . the later requires opto - galvanic detection setup while the former relies on doppler free optical spectroscopy . in the following we have implemented modulation transfer spectroscopy  ( mts ) which unlike the frequency modulation spectra  ( fms ) produces a zero crossing signal at the resonance frequency thereby allowing direct frequency locking of the laser to the molecular transition frequency similar to a pound - drever - hall signal  @xcite .",
    "+ tellurium dimer has a rich spectra covering parts of ultra - violate  ( uv ) and visible wavelengths .",
    "a comprehensive study of its broad spectra has been performed by cariou and luc in what is now known as the te@xmath0 atlas @xcite . however , in order to frequency lock a laser it is important to detect transition lines close to the targeted transition line of the atomic species under investigation .",

    "simultaneous opto - galvanometric measurement of a barium hollow cathode lamp  ( hcl ) was recorded .",
    "we find two new te@xmath0 lines within the @xmath21ghz wide hcl spectrum with the closest one being only @xmath22mhz away from the needed barium line .",
    "the closeness of this transition makes it a suitable frequency reference which can easily be bridged by an acousto - optic modulator  ( aom ) . in the following",
    ", we will provide a description of our setup , measurement procedure and present our results before concluding in the last section .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our laser design and electronics to generate the @xmath18 nm laser light along with an overview of the setup to measure the mts spectra of te@xmath0 in a hot vapor cell .",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] which includes both the mts setup of tellurium and the hcl spectroscopy of barium using the @xmath19 nm diode laser .",
    "the laser is an extended cavity diode laser similar to the nist design  @xcite where a special pivot point is selected to have minimal cavity length change as the ecdl is frequency scanned .",
    "the laser diode is _",
    "nichia ndb4216e _ with anti - reflection coating on the front facet in order to minimize the diode laser modes .",
    "the diode is driven by an in - house @xmath23 designed current drive , very similar to the original j.  hall design  @xcite while mode - hop - free operation over a wide frequency range is ensured by feed forward added to the diode operating current .",
    "the feed forward current and the scan voltages are generated from a direct digital synthesis  ( dds ) implemented on low cost @xmath24 board taking into account the ecdl cavity length change as a result of the angular ( @xmath25 ) tuning of the piezo .",
    "the optical output power of the diode with and without the ecdl is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the laser diode under ecdl condition shows more regular mode - hops as the current is increased beyond @xmath26ma . at the operational wavelength ,",
    "total power of @xmath27mw is available at a diode current of @xmath20ma for the experiment . out of this ,",
    "about @xmath28mw is used for the implementation of the mts setup , about @xmath29mw is used for the hcl spectrometry , about @xmath30mw is used for wavemeter measurement and the rest is available for the ion trap experiment .",
    "all these paths are fiber coupled with an efficiency of about @xmath31 .",
    "the unusually high power requirement in the wavemeter path is mainly due to low efficiency in the wavemeter switch which is located about @xmath27 m away from our laboratory .",
    "+    a faraday isolator ( fi ) is placed in front of the ecdl minimizing the optical feedback . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the laser beam from the ecdl is divided into three components by a couple of beam splitters(bs ) bs1 and bs2 for the mts setup , the hcl setup and the @xmath32mhz resolution wavemeter setup respectively .",
    "the optical setup for mts spectroscopy utilizes two polarising beam splitter ( pbs ) : pbs1 is used to split the beam into pump and probe while pbs2 is used for re - combining them as both arms overlap inside the te@xmath0 cell .",
    "the intensity ratio in those two beams is controlled by a zero order half wave plate ( hwp ) hwp1 .",
    "the other two half waveplates hwp2 and hwp3 are used to control the polarization of individual beams .",
    "the pump beam is phase modulated by an electro - optic modulator  ( eom)(crystal : mgo doped linbo3 ) which is driven at a modulation frequency of @xmath33mhz .",
    "the probe beam is aligned collinearly with the counter propagating modulated pump beam through a @xmath28 cm long te@xmath0 cell which is placed inside an oven heated to @xmath34k .",
    "the temperature of the cell is maintained to within @xmath35k by thermal isolation .",
    "two photodiodes of responsivity @xmath36a / w detect the mts signal or saturation absorption signal after the pbs2 .",
    "the photodiode ( pd ) signal is then amplified by a low noise amplifier and fed into a @xmath37built mts locking board comprising of a frequency mixer with low pass filter at @xmath32khz cut - off and a pid controller for frequency locking purposes .",
    "this board generates error signal which is split into two parts : one feeds back to the current of the ecdl for any fast frequency correction and the other feeds back to the piezo driver board for slow drift corrections .",
    "the light which is reflected from bs2 is used for hcl spectroscopy .",
    "this part is sent to the barium hollow cathode lamp after chopping at a frequency of @xmath38khz to avoid low frequency electronic noise in the lock - in - amplifier detection setup . the opto - galvanic signal from the hcl",
    "is separated out using a high pass filter and the voltage drop across a @xmath30kohm resistor is detected by _",
    "stanford research : srs380 _ lock - in - amplifier .",
    "simultaneous data of the lock - in - amplifier and the wavemeter are logged into a computer using python code .",
    "a symmetric triangular voltage @xmath39v is applied to the piezo of the ecdl in order to scan the range of frequencies which is close the barium resonance as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in order to obtain this full range of frequencies spanned over @xmath40ghz ,",
    "appropriate feed - forward has been applied .",
    "both the tellurium resonances as well as the hcl spectra of the @xmath17 transition of the barium ion observed within this scan range .",
    "the frequency axis is calibrated by locking the laser at individual te@xmath0 resonance and measuring the wavelength from the wavemeter with a resolution of @xmath32mhz .",
    "the absolute wavelength value has been determined from the gaussian fit to the hcl spectra which matches well with nist data .",
    "the linearity of the frequency axis is determined from the fit with reduced @xmath41 leading to @xmath42 uncertainty . as is evident from the hcl spectrum containing the gaussian fit ,",
    "the barium resonance wavelength can be determined within @xmath43mhz uncertainty , thereby limiting our overall uncertainty of the absolute scale to the same value . in order to ensure that individual te@xmath0 lines are within the uncertainty set by the hcl spectrum",
    ", we performed a line - shape fit to te2 line as shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the line shape of mts resonance is devoid of any background slope unlike fms .",
    "this shape can be described according to @xcite by    @xmath44 , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denotes the electronic levels of te@xmath0 , @xmath47 is the electric dipole matrix element between them , @xmath48 is the laser detuning , @xmath49 are decay rates of the levels and @xmath50 is the optical relaxation rate between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the modulation frequency and phase are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "as an example one of the the resonance line shape as obtained in the experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the line is fitted with a overall scaling factor equivalent to @xmath53 , the relaxation rate @xmath50 for the involved transition and the unknown phase @xmath52 .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath50 obtained from the best fit provides the linewidth to be @xmath54mhz with a reduced @xmath55 .",
    "the zero - crossing of the resonance along with electronic suppression ( about 100 ) allows the laser to be locked with a bandwidth of a few hundred khz .",
    "the model mostly fits well with all the resonances except a few where an additional etalon effect modifies the base level of the signal .",
    "one particular point to note is the width of these resonances are higher as compared to the te@xmath0 resonances obtained near the barium s@xmath56-p@xmath57 transition at @xmath14 nm which is attributed to the higher vibrational level densities for shorter wavelengths . +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the result as summarised in figure  [ fig:3 ] contains seven resonances which has been observed for the first time .",
    "the previously reported lines in the te@xmath0 atlas are about @xmath58ghz away from the barium line , therefore it can not be used for laser locking .",
    "however for the linearity check of our frequency scan we have also used those resonance and found them to be matching well within the uncertainties .",
    "the frequencies are tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] along with their uncertainties and relative strengths .",
    "as for line no .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 , the resonance lines are close to each other due to our fast scan .",
    "we have observed these lines with higher resolution scan as well .",
    "notably , despite the high relative strength of the second line , it was not observed in the @xmath61 atlas possibly due to poorer resolution .",
    "we have performed modulation transfer spectroscopy on a hot tellurium cell using an in - house ecdl laser at @xmath18 nm constructed from a commercially available nichia diode .",
    "the laser is built for trapped barium ion experiment .",
    "for the first time we have observed seven resonance lines in the neighbourhood of barium ion dipole transition @xmath17 , the closest being only @xmath22mhz away .",
    "all the observed transitions are having signal - to - noise ratio of more than @xmath62 , except for line no.@xmath63 where the ratio is around @xmath64 .",
    "the resonance line no.@xmath65 closest to the barium transition has a s / n of more than @xmath66 leading to a robust frequency lock .",
    "these measurements will allow new reference for precision barium ion experiment which varies from fundamental physics to quantum information processing .",
    "moreover the barium ion @xmath17 transition is also used for raman pumping into the dark @xmath67 state where absolute locking reference for the @xmath18 nm laser will make the experiments more stable and robust against frequency drifts . in addition , te@xmath0 is already an established reference for the other barium transition namely the @xmath68",
