    "in this paper we study the statistics of avalanches propagating in complex networks .",
    "the study of avalanches of activity in complex networks is relevant to diverse fields , including epidemiology @xcite , genealogy @xcite , and neuroscience @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of an avalanche corresponds to a branching process @xcite , first studied by galton and watson @xcite , which can be considered as an avalanche propagating in a tree network .",
    "various generalizations to the case where avalanches propagate in a more general network have been considered recently @xcite , and related problems such as the distribution of cluster size in percolation models @xcite and self - organized criticality in the `` sandpile '' model @xcite have been studied .",
    "in contrast to these previous studies , we develop a theory of avalanche size and duration on complex networks that , instead of using some form of mean field analysis , explicitly includes the network topology .",
    "this approach allows for an analysis of avalanches starting from arbitrary nodes in the network and the effect of nontrivial network structure on the distribution of avalanche size and duration .",
    "our formalism in this paper is general , describing dynamics with applications to a wide variety of systems .",
    "our results are correspondingly general , but they may be of particular interest to those investigating recent experimental observations of avalanches of neuronal bursting in the mammalian cortex .",
    "when a neuron fires , it stimulates other neurons which may subsequently fire . when this linked activity occurs in a cascade , it is called a _ neuronal avalanche _ ( experimentally , neuronal avalanches are observed propagating in functional networks where each node represents a group of neurons ) .",
    "recent experiments have studied neuronal avalanches of activity in the brains of awake monkeys @xcite , anesthetized rats @xcite , slices of rat cortex @xcite , and humans @xcite .",
    "these studies found that when the tissue is allowed to grow and operate undisturbed in homeostasis @xcite , both the size and temporal duration of neuronal avalanches is distributed according to a power - law .",
    "in contrast , the application of drugs that selectively decrease the activity of inhibitory or excitatory neurons results in avalanches with different statistics @xcite . based on these observations ,",
    "it has been argued and demonstrated experimentally that many neuronal networks operate in a critical regime that leads to power - law avalanche distributions @xcite , maximized dynamic range @xcite , and maximized information capacity @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to characterize this critical state and to understand how experimental signatures of criticality may change upon modification of the underlying network ( e.g. , changes induced by the drugs used in experiments ) .",
    "we find that the statistical properties of avalanches are determined by spectral properties of the matrix whose entries @xmath0 are the probabilities that the avalanche propagates from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalue @xmath3 of maximum magnitude ( by the perron - frobenius theorem @xmath3 is real and positive if @xmath4 ) and its associated eigenvector play a prominent role in determining the functional form and the parameters for the statistical distribution of avalanche size and duration .",
    "while many of our findings have analogous results in classical galton - watson branching processes @xcite , we emphasize that our analysis allows us to identify how changes in network structure affect the parameters of the statistical distributions of avalanche size and duration .",
    "moreover , our theory allows us to obtain the statistics of avalanches starting at particular network nodes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ section - formulation ]",
    "we describe our model for avalanche propagation in networks . in secs .",
    "[ section - duration ] and [ section - size ] we analyze the statistics of avalanche duration and size . in sec .  [ section - experiments ] we validate our analysis through numerical experiments .",
    "section  [ section - discussion ] presents further discussion and conclusions .",
    "to model the propagation of avalanches in a network , we consider a network of @xmath5 nodes labeled @xmath6 .",
    "each node @xmath2 has a state @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to @xmath9 as the _ resting _ state and to @xmath10 as the _ excited _ state . at discrete times @xmath11 the states of the nodes @xmath12 are simultaneously updated as follows : ( i ) if node @xmath2 is in the resting state , @xmath13 , it can be excited by an excited node @xmath1 , @xmath14 , with probability @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 .",
    "( ii ) the nodes that are excited , @xmath17 , will deterministically return to the resting state in the next time step , @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore describe a network of @xmath5 nodes with a @xmath19 weighted network adjacency matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath4 may be thought of as the strength of connection from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 , and @xmath21 implies that node @xmath1 does not connect to node @xmath2 .",
    "we will assume that given any two nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the probability that an excitation originating at node @xmath1 is able to excite node @xmath2 ( through potentially many intermediate nodes ) is not zero .",
    "this is equivalent to saying the network is fully connected , and therefore the matrix @xmath22 is _",
    "irreducible_.    starting from a single excited node @xmath23 ( @xmath24 if @xmath25 and @xmath26 if @xmath27 ) , we let the system evolve according to the dynamics above , and observe the cascade of activity until there are no more excited nodes .",
    "this motivates the following definitions , which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ treeexample ] : ( 1 ) an _ avalanche _ is the sequence of excitations produced by a single excited node ; ( 2 ) the _ duration _ @xmath28 of an avalanche is defined as the total number of time steps spanned by the avalanche : if the avalanche starts with @xmath29 , then @xmath30 an avalanche that continues indefinitely is said to have infinite duration ; ( 3 ) the _ size _ @xmath31 of an avalanche starting at @xmath32 is defined as the total number of nodes excited during an avalanche , allowing for nodes to be excited multiple times : @xmath33 note that it is possible for an avalanche to have size larger than the total size of the network ( e.g. , if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to determine the probability distributions of these variables in terms of the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "in order to analyze the statistics of avalanche duration , we define @xmath36 as the probability that an avalanche starting at node @xmath1 has duration less than or equal to @xmath37 , @xmath38 the quantity @xmath36 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the random variable @xmath39 . in what follows",
    ", we will restrict our attention to a class of networks that we call _ locally tree - like_. by locally tree - like , in this paper we shall mean that , for any given @xmath37 not too large , and pair of nodes @xmath40 and @xmath23 , if there exists a directed path of length @xmath37 from @xmath40 to @xmath23 , then it is rarely the case that there will also exist a second such path @xcite .",
    "many networks found in applications are of this type , and it has been found that the locally tree - like approximation works very well in describing various dynamical processes while still capturing the effects of network heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "for these networks , we can approximately treat the avalanches propagating to different neighbors of node @xmath1 as independent , and write the recursion relation @xmath41,\\ ] ] together with @xmath42 which follows from the definition .",
    "the right hand side of eq .",
    "is the probability that nodes are either not excited by node @xmath1 , or , if they are , that they generate avalanches of duration at most @xmath37 : @xmath43 is the probability that an excitation _ does not _ pass from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 , whereas @xmath44 is the probability that an excitation _ does _ pass from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 and the resulting avalanche has duration at most @xmath37 .",
    "note that eq .   can treat any node @xmath1 as the starting node for an avalanche . as discussed above , eq .",
    "assumes that the descendent branches of the avalanche are independent .",
    "it is , however , possible that an avalanche may branch in such a way that two branches interact at a later time .",
    "nevertheless , for the networks we studied we found that , while these events do occur for large avalanches , they do not significantly affect our predictions .",
    "we show numerical results confirming this in sec .",
    "[ section - experiments ] .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of long avalanche duration , i.e. , in the asymptotic form of @xmath36 for @xmath45 . by definition ( see also appendix [ appendixa ] ) , @xmath36 is a bounded , increasing function of @xmath37 , and therefore it must converge to a value @xmath46 which can be interpreted as the probability that an avalanche starting at node @xmath1 has finite duration . our analysis will be based on whether or not this limit is strictly less than one or equal to one .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appendixa ] , this is determined by the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of @xmath22 , @xmath3 : if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "the case @xmath49 will be referred to as the _ subcritical _ case , and the case @xmath50 will be referred to as the _ critical _ case . on the other hand , if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 , which implies that there is a nonzero probability that an avalanche has infinite duration .",
    "this case will be referred to as the _ supercritical case_. the asymptotic form of @xmath36 will be analyzed separately for these three cases below .      in the subcritical case , @xmath54 is the only fixed point of the system eq .",

    "we identify @xmath3 as the perron - frobenius eigenvalue since , having the largest magnitude among all the eigenvalues , @xmath60 will be the dominant term as @xmath45 when compared with the other modes .",

    "this issue is discussed in @xcite , where it is found that this separation is typically large in networks without strong community structure .",
    "henceforth , we will assume that @xmath3 is well separated from the rest of the spectrum of @xmath22 .",

    "agreement is excellent over the entire range of @xmath3 values tested .    beyond aggregate statistics",
    ", we also test a more subtle prediction of eq .  .",
    "in sec .  [ section - duration ] , we concluded that @xmath55 , the probability that an avalanche started at node @xmath1 lasts more than @xmath37 steps , scales for large @xmath37 as @xmath237 , where @xmath62 is the left perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath22 .",
    "other research in the network adjacency matrix literature has noted that the vector of nodal out - degrees ( in - degrees ) is a good approximation for the right ( left ) dominant eigenvector of @xmath22 in the absence of degree correlations @xcite . in this light ,",
    "our prediction above is understandable : when there are not degree correlations in the network , a node with a larger right eigenvector entry ( and thus larger out - degree ) will tend to produce longer avalanches .",
    "therefore , in order to fully test our prediction , we created networks with _ assortative mixing by degree _ @xcite , a type of degree correlation which we measure using the coefficient @xmath238 @xcite , @xmath239 where @xmath240 denotes an average over all edges and @xmath23 are weighted nodal degrees defined as @xmath241 and @xmath242 . in the absence of degree correlations between connected nodes @xmath243 and @xmath244 . in assortative networks , there exists a positive correlation ( @xmath245 ) between the in - degree at node @xmath1 and the out - degree at node @xmath2 at the ends of a directed link from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "when the correlation is negative ( @xmath246 ) , the network is called disassortative .",
    "thus we created erds - rnyi random networks with @xmath247 nodes , and rewired each network via a link - swapping process ( as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) until we had very assortative and disassortative networks ( @xmath248 and @xmath249 , respectively ) . eq",
    ".   implies that in such networks , the tails of the cdf of avalanches originating at node @xmath1 will be proportional to the corresponding entry of the right eigenvector , which may differ significantly from the nodal out - degree .",
    "for the a subcritical network ( @xmath250 ) with assortativity coefficient @xmath249 we plot @xmath251 and its corresponding entry in the right dominant eigenvector @xmath69 for each node @xmath1 , in fig .",
    "[ figure - assortativity ] , showing that proportionality is excellent . in the inset of the same figure we plot @xmath251 against the corresponding out - degree @xmath252 for each node @xmath1 , showing that proportionality to out - degree does not hold .",
    "assortative networks produce the same effect , but are not shown here .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the asymptotic distributions of the duration and size of avalanches in complex networks .",
    "this work is of interest in various applications , most notably neuroscience @xcite and the analysis of power - grid failure cascades @xcite . while some of our results , such as the functional forms for the distributions , are analogous to those found in classical galton - watson branching processes @xcite or in mean - field models @xcite , we emphasize the distinguishing aspects of our results : ( i ) we generalize the criterion for criticality to @xmath50 , which depends on the topology of the network in ways that previous results do not capture .",
    "for example , in critical branching processes @xcite the condition for criticality is @xmath253 .",
    "( ii ) the parameters of the asymptotic distributions in the various regimes are affected by the network topology , and our results allow us to predict how various factors such as network degree distributions or degree - degree correlations affect these parameters [ e.g. , the parameter @xmath200 in eq .   or @xmath82 in eq .  ] .",
    "( iii ) in contrast to previous studies , our results allow us to predict the statistics of avalanches generated at a particular node .",
    "this might be of critical importance in certain applications where the adjacency matrix is known or can be inferred ( such as the power grid or the autonomous system network of the internet ) since one can then allocate resources to prevent avalanches , if so desired , that start at the nodes which tend to generate the largest avalanches . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure - assortativity ] , the naive prediction that the nodes with the largest out - degree generate the largest avalanches is not necessarily true when the networks have nontrivial structure , such as degree correlations .    in developing our theory , we made some assumptions which we now discuss . first , we assumed that the network was locally tree - like .",
    "this allowed us to treat avalanches propagating to the neighbors of a given node as independent of each other .",
    "while this is a good approximation for the networks we used , it is certainly not true in general . in particular , avalanches propagating separately from a given node",
    "might excite the same node as they grow .",
    "the result is that the number of nodes that the avalanches excite in the simulation may be less than what the theory would predict . in running our simulations",
    ", we addressed this issue in two ways : first , we kept track of the number of times two branches of the same avalanche simultaneously excited the same node @xmath1 , finding it to be an increasing function of avalanche size and perron - frobenius eigenvalue , yet still negligible when compared to the total number of excitations .",
    "in addition , each time such an event occurred , we separately generated an avalanche starting from the doubly excited node @xmath1 and corrected both the size and duration of the original avalanche by incorporating these additional avalanches .",
    "we found that doing this had no appreciable effect on the measured distributions , and so all figures shown in this manuscript are produced from simulation data _ without _ the additional compensating avalanches included .",
    "this , and the fact that the numerical simulations are described well by the theory , suggest that the interaction of avalanches propagating to different neighbor nodes can be safely neglected in the networks studied .",
    "the performance of our theory in networks that are not locally tree - like , such as networks with a high degree of clustering , is left for future research .",
    "another approximation we used is that the perron - frobenius eigenvalue @xmath3 is well separated from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "this is a good approximation in networks without well defined communities , but can break down in networks with strong community structure @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our results show that the experimental signatures of criticality in neural systems ( characterized by a power - law distribution of avalanche size and duration with exponents @xmath202 and @xmath254 , respectively @xcite ) are robust to complex underlying network topologies .",

    "first , we have @xmath271 and @xmath272 , so the statement is valid for @xmath273 .",

    "note that , although from the definition , it follows that @xmath36 are nondecreasing , this proof is necessary since eq .",
    "is an approximation .",
    "in this appendix we argue that the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of the similar matrices @xmath157 and @xmath77 is less than one when the perron - frobenius eigenvalue of @xmath22 is greater than one : @xmath279 .",

    "now , we left multiply the previous equation by @xmath294 , where @xmath121 is the right perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath77 , satisfying @xmath295 , to get @xmath296 if @xmath51 , appendix [ appendixa ] shows that the entries of @xmath297 are all positive . since the perron - frobenius eigenvector @xmath121 has positive entries as well ( since we are assuming @xmath22 is irreducible ) , the right hand side of eq .",
    "is positive .",
    "now , we argue that the vector @xmath298 has nonpositive entries : as @xmath286 increases , the probability of an excitation passing between any pair of nodes increases , and thus the probability of having a finite avalanche can not increase , i.e. , @xmath299",
