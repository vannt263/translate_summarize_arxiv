    "the mechanism of core - collapse supernovae has been an open question for decades . in the past 15 years , a lot of detailed numerical simulations have been done by many authors , paying attention to various aspects of the dynamics ( see , for example , @xcite for the latest review of the subject ) .",
    "spherically symmetric models have incorporated full general relativity and solved the radiation - hydrodynamical equations with realistic equations of state and neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "these computations demonstrated consistently that the stalled shock wave is highly unlikely to be revived by neutrino heatings in the spherically symmetric dynamics .",
    "multi - dimensional simulations have been also making a remarkable progress over the times ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "local non - spherical motions of convection - type are common in the envelope as inferred from the spectra and light curves  @xcite , and are believed to occur also in the core .",
    "the global asymmetry as observed in the ejecta of sn1987a is also supposed to be common to the core - collapse supernovae  @xcite . motivated by these observations , the implications of the asymmetry for the explosion mechanism have been investigated intensively and extensively ( see again @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the instability of the standing accretion shock wave was discovered by @xcite in the context of core - collapse supernova and its nature has been studied both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "the ramifications to the global asymmetry of the ejecta as mentioned above and the high kick velocities of young pulsars  @xcite were discussed by @xcite in more realistic simulations .",
    "since it has been demonstrated  @xcite over the years that these instabilities tend to facilitate the shock revival by neutrino heatings , attempts have been done with little success  @xcite so far to show by realistic multi - dimensional simulations that an explosion is indeed induced .",
    "this situation may change .",
    "very recently , @xcite have proposed a new possibility to induce explosions .",
    "they have done long - term simulations of axisymmetric 2d radiation - hydrodynamics .",
    "although some microphysics are incomplete and the formulation is essentially non - relativistic , their models with no equatorial symmetry and artificial inner boundary condition being imposed have obtained a shock revival after a rather long delay ( @xmath6ms after bounce ) not by the neutrino heatings but by what they call the `` acoustic '' mechanism .",
    "they have claimed that the turbulence of accreted matter induces mainly @xmath0-mode oscillations in the proto neutron star , which in turn emit acoustic waves that are dissipated as they propagate outward to become shock waves .",
    "this is a quite new idea that has eluded the discovery by multi - dimensional numerical studies for many years , the reasons for which are , the authors think , that previous computations were not long enough and/or put too restrictive conditions such as the artificial inner boundary that has been frequently employed to reduce the cfl constraint on numerical time steps . @xcite",
    "have insisted that the merit of this mechanism is the self - regulation in such a way that the @xmath0-mode excitations and subsequent emissions of acoustic waves are maintained until the shock revival occurs .",
    "this is an interesting possibility and certainly worth further exploration .",
    "there are indeed a lot of things remaining to be clarified .",
    "first of all , the mechanism seems to be rather inefficient in transferring the energy .",
    "inferred from the published results , the explosion energy appears to be substantially smaller than the canonical value .",
    "since the mechanism constitutes of multiple steps , the efficiency of the couplings between different steps should be understood . for that purpose",
    ", we think that the linear analysis utilizing an idealized model that mimics the realistic situation is more suitable than large scale simulations . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the eigen frequencies and eigen functions of the @xmath0-modes in a non - rotating proto neutron star . assuming that the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) is responsible for the excitation of the @xmath0-modes in the acoustic mechanism",
    ", we estimate the efficiency , formulating and solving the equations for forced oscillations of the @xmath0-modes . in so doing , we use the pressure fluctuations in sasi that we obtained in the previous numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "the emissions of acoustic waves by these excited @xmath0-modes are currently being investigated numerically and will be published elsewhere  @xcite .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ form ] , we describe the models of proto neutron star and formulate the basic equations for the normal modes and their forced oscillations .",
    "the sasi that we use as an external force to drive the oscillations of @xmath0-modes is also presented there .",
    "we give the numerical results in section  [ result ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ conclusion ] with some discussions .",
    "we will investigate the @xmath0-mode excitations in the proto neutron star , one of the key steps in the acoustic mechanism , under the following assumptions : ( i ) a non - rotating proto neutron star is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "( ii ) sasi in the accreting matter is responsible for the excitations of @xmath0-modes .",
    "( iii ) the oscillation amplitudes in the proto neutron star are small compared with the radius . as shown in the numerical simulations done by @xcite , these assumptions are reasonable after the stagnation of a prompt shock wave until the excited @xmath0-modes grow sufficiently and their non - linear effects on the dynamics become significant .",
    "then the dynamics of the proto neutron star can be treated by the linear perturbation theory formulated below .",
    "the linear perturbation of stars can be described in terms of the lagrangian displacement @xmath7 , which obeys the equation of motion given as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the self - adjoint operator and the external force driving the perturbations ( see , e.g. , friedman & schutz 1978 ; unno et al . 1989 ) .",
    "here , we have assumed the unperturbed star to be static and spherically symmetric . assuming the lagrangian displacement to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the eigen function and eigen frequency , respectively",

    "we impose for the normal mode solutions the regularity condition at the stellar center and @xmath18 at the stellar surface , where @xmath19 stands for the lagrangian change of the pressure @xmath20 .",
    "when the unperturbed star is static and spherically symmetric , the orthogonality of the eigen functions allows us to adopt the normalization @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the density , mass and radius of the unperturbed star , respectively ( see , e.g. , unno et al .",

    "then the following dispersion relation is obtained : @xmath60 which implies that if @xmath61 , the wave number @xmath59 is real and the corresponding wave can propagate in the radial direction , whereas the wave number @xmath59 becomes purely imaginary and the amplitude of the perturbation grows or damps exponentially with @xmath29 when @xmath62 .      in this study , we are concerned with the excitation of oscillations in the proto neutron star by the turbulence in accreting matter . in our formulation , we take into account the latter effect as pressure perturbations at the surface of proto neutron star .",
    "hence we set @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ basic_eq1 ] ) and adopt the time - dependent non - vanishing pressure perturbation given by @xmath64 instead of the ordinary condition @xmath18 at the proto neutron star surface . here",
    "the function of time , @xmath65 , describes how the stellar surface is disturbed by the accreted matter and is taken from the numerical results obtained in our previous exploration of sasi ( see section  [ sasi ] ) .",

    "( [ dynamic_eq2 ] ) with the following initial conditions , @xmath92      as already mentioned above , we assume in this paper that oscillations in the proto neutron star are excited by the turbulence of accreting matter , which is supposed to be induced by sasi .",
    "sasi is a non - local hydrodynamical instability that occurs in the accretion flow through the standing shock wave onto the proto neutron star  @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism is still controversial  @xcite , sasi is probably driven by the cycle of inward advections of entropy- and vortex - perturbations and outward propagations of pressure fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the prominent feature of sasi is the dominance of low @xmath1 modes both in the linear and non - linear regimes . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath93 mode is thought to be a promising cause for the proper motions of young pulsars . in this paper , we regard sasi as a source of pressure perturbations exerted on the surface of the proto neutron star , that is , @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ def_f ] ) .",
    "we employ the numerical results obtained by @xcite , in which we have done 2d axisymmetric simulations of the accretion flows through the standing shock wave onto the proto neutron star .",
    "the realistic equation of state by @xcite and the standard reaction rates  @xcite for the neutrino absorptions and emissions on nucleons were employed .",
    "the mass accretion rate and the neutrino luminosity are the parameters that specify a particular steady accretion flow and were held constant during the computations . the self - gravity of the accreting matter was ignored and only the gravitational attraction by the proto neutron star was taken into account .",
    "the mass of the proto neutron star was also set to be constant ( 1.4m@xmath94 ) so that we could obtain completely steady background flows , to which velocity perturbations were added initially .    in the following ,",
    "we use the results for the model with the mass accretion rate of @xmath950.19m@xmath94/s and neutrino luminosity of @xmath96erg / s , which are typical for the post bounce core around the shock stagnation .",
    "the neutrino spectra were assumed to take a fermi - dirac distribution with a vanishing chemical potential and a temperature of @xmath97mev for the electron - type neutrino and @xmath98mev for the electron - type anti - neutrino .",
    "the random velocity perturbation of less than @xmath99 was added to the radial velocity initially .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for more detailed formulations .",
    "we observed sasi growing exponentially in the linear phase that lasts for @xmath100100ms and then saturated to enter the non - linear phase .",
    "the @xmath93 feature was clearly seen in the non - linear stage for this model although other modes were also generated by non - linear mode couplings .",
    "we expanded the eulerian pressure perturbation at the inner boundary by the spherical harmonic functions .",
    "we used only the @xmath93 component in this study , since this was claimed to be the most important mode  @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of this component is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as can be seen",
    ", the pressure perturbation is actually a series of impulsive forces that last for quite short times .",
    "it should be noted that the linear analysis of sasi for this model gives the eigen frequency of @xmath101hz for the linear @xmath93 mode .",
    "the non - linear couplings broaden the spectrum both to the lower and higher frequencies .",
    "as seen later in section  [ result ] , the spectrum has most of the power in much lower frequencies than the typical @xmath0-mode frequencies of several hundreds hz , which leads to a severe impedance mismatch in exciting @xmath0-modes .    it should be mentioned that the model studied here is not fully self - consistent . for example , what we need in eq .",
    "( [ def_f ] ) is the lagrangian perturbation of pressure while what we obtained above is the eulerian perturbation .",
    "this is simply because the former is difficult to obtain from the numerical data .",
    "although they are different , rigorously speaking , we think that the difference will not change the outcome qualitatively , since it is the typical frequency and spectral feature of sasi that matters in this study .",
    "we should also bear in mind that the sasi spectrum employed in this study is just a single realization of essentially chaotic flows although we expect it is representative .",
    "finally , the spherically symmetric , stationary proto neutron star that is adopted as the unperturbed state in this study is briefly described .",
    "the model is based essentially on the results of detailed radiation - hydrodynamical simulation of core - collapse by @xcite , but we have modified it in the following way .    we have developed a numerical code to compute the long - term post - bounce evolution in the quasi - steady approximation  @xcite , the details of which will be published elsewhere . in this formalism , we solve separately but consistently three different regions in the collapsing star simultaneously : ( 1 ) the proto neutron star that cools in a quasi - static way .",
    "we calculate both the equilibrium configuration and the neutrino transport in it with matter accretion taken into account .",
    "( 2 ) the steady accretion flow from the standing shock wave down to the proto neutron star for the given neutrino luminosity obtained in the calculation ( 1 ) and matter accretion rate given by the next computation . (",
    "3 ) the dynamical implosion of the envelope toward the standing shock wave .",
    "the second and third regions are joined by the rankine - hugoniot condition at the shock wave consistently .",
    "the code can follow the spherically symmetric quasi - static evolutions for more than 10 seconds and we have confirmed that the evolution is well reproduced for the first second , for which the result of the detailed dynamical simulations is available . in this study , we utilize the proto neutron star , which is obtained in this approximation and is in hydro - static equilibrium at @xmath100360ms after bounce .",
    "physical quantities characterizing the proto neutron star model , that is , mass @xmath23 , radius @xmath24 , and kepler frequency @xmath102 are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the profiles of density , pressure , specific entropy , and electron fraction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] as a function of radius .",
    "it is noted that this spherically symmetric model contains a convectively unstable region around @xmath103 km .    here",
    "again , the proto neutron star model is not very consistent with the model for sasi .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , it is not our aim to construct a fully self - consistent model in this paper , where the elementary feature of the @xmath0-mode excitations is explored qualitatively from an experimental point of view . for that purpose ,",
    "the slight inconsistency in the current model does not matter .",
    "we first consider the oscillation properties of @xmath0-modes for the proto neutron star model described in the previous section . before giving the eigen functions , we look into the so - called propagation diagram ( see , e.g. , unno et al .",
    "1989 ) , which is useful to see where in the star the wave with a particular frequency @xmath104 can propagate .",
    "the diagram shows the square of the lamb frequency @xmath105 and the brunt - visl frequency @xmath106 as a function of the normalized radius @xmath107 . as explained in section [ form ] , since the waves can propagate when @xmath61 is satisfied , the region where this condition holds true is called the propagation zone , and the other regions in the diagram are referred to as an evanescent zone , in which the perturbations do not oscillate but grow or damp exponentially .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the propagation diagram for the present proto neutron star model , in which we take @xmath93 to calculate the lamb frequency and the frequency is normalized according to eq .",
    "( [ omgbar ] ) .",
    "the propagation regions can be classified into two categories : one is the @xmath0-mode propagation zone indicated as hatched regions and the other is the @xmath20-mode propagation zone shown as a cross - hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as mentioned already ,",
    "since the proto neutron star has a convective region around @xmath108 , which is an evanescent zone for @xmath0-modes , there are two disconnected @xmath0-mode propagation zones , one is near the center of the star and the other near the surface .",
    "this implies that a particular @xmath0-mode is almost trapped in one of these two disconnected @xmath0-mode propagation zones .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-modes for the current proto neutron star model are essentially divided into two classes , i.e. , what we refer to as the core @xmath0-modes ( @xmath109-modes ) and the surface @xmath0-modes ( @xmath110-modes ) , whose amplitudes of the eigen functions have a peak near the center and the surface of the proto neutron star , respectively .",
    "we now discuss the properties of the normal mode oscillations obtained numerically for the current proto neutron star model . in table",
    "[ table2 ] , we summarize the key quantities for several low - order @xmath0-modes : the normalized angular eigen frequencies , @xmath111 , the corresponding frequencies in hz , @xmath112 , the mode energies , @xmath41 , and the integral quantities , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ def_a ] ) and ( [ def_b ] ) .",
    "the last two are important in evaluating the excitations of @xmath0-modes by external perturbations in the next section .",
    "the mode energy gives us a rough measure of non - linear oscillations in the proto neutron star .",
    "note that we employ the normalization condition for the eigen functions , eq .",
    "( [ norm_eq ] ) , in evaluating the mode energy @xmath41 .",
    "as expected , the mode energy is of the order of @xmath113ergs .",
    "the typical frequency of low - order @xmath0-modes is several hundreds hz , and we can confirm that the numbers given in table  [ table2 ] are comparable with those found by @xcite .",
    "it should be also emphasized that these frequencies are much larger than the typical frequency , @xmath114100 hz , of sasi in the non - linear stage .",
    "it is also recognized in table  [ table2 ] that for @xmath115 the lowest mode is a surface mode and core modes and surface modes appear alternately as one goes to higher overtones .    in fig .  [ fig2 ] , the eigen functions , @xmath116 and @xmath117 in eqs .",

    ", the @xmath119- and @xmath4-modes are a typical surface and core @xmath0-mode , respectively .",
    "in fact , the eigen functions have a non - negligible amplitude either outside or inside the convection region , which is an evanescent zone for @xmath0-modes and located at @xmath120 km .",

    "although the general trend is that their absolute values decrease as the radial node number increases , there are exceptions that are critically important in determining which mode is most efficiently excited by external perturbations as explained below .",
    "now we move on to the excitation by accreting matter of the @xmath0-modes considered just above . as mentioned before , we assume in this study that the @xmath0-modes are excited by the pressure fluctuations around the surface of the proto neutron star , which are induced by sasi in the accretion flow . the pressure fluctuation @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ def_f ] ) is obtained from the numerical results on sasi and is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a power spectrum .",
    "it should be repeated that the major peaks of the spectrum are observed in the frequencies much lower than those of the low - order @xmath0-modes given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "in other words , the typical frequency of sasi , the driving force , is much lower than that of the low - order @xmath0-modes that should be excited in the proto neutron star .",
    "it is true that these numbers are dependent on the models of proto neutron star and sasi as well as eos employed , but we expect that the mismatch of the frequencies is a rather generic issue .    by making use of the pressure fluctuations shown in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we show the temporal evolution of the mode energy for the @xmath122-mode with @xmath93 . since the driving forces , that is , the pressure fluctuations induced by sasi are a collection of impulsive forces , the mode energy is fluctuating on a short time scale .",
    "it is clear , however , that the mode is growing for @xmath100100ms initially and then is saturated .",
    "the maximum value of the excited mode energy is @xmath123 for this mode , which is considerably smaller than the typical energy of non - linear oscillations , @xmath124erg , given in table  [ table2 ] . in this sense ,",
    "the excitation of the @xmath0-modes is inefficient , at least for the present model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the severe mismatch in the frequencies of the driving force , sasi , and the excited @xmath0-modes .",
    "hence it is more appropriate to refer to what we see here as the forced oscillation rather than as the excitation .",
    "it is noted , however , that the eulerian pressure perturbations at @xmath125 km are found to be of the same order as those found in @xcite .",
    "the maximum values of the mode energy for other @xmath0-modes , @xmath126erg , are even smaller than that of the @xmath122-mode with @xmath93 for the proto neutron star model considered here .",

    "this apparent inefficiency of the @xmath0-mode excitations is a direct consequence of the mismatch of the frequencies of the @xmath0-modes and sasi .",
    "it is noted , however , that what is important for the acoustic mechanism may not be the mode energy .",
    "in fact , the @xcite mentioned that the @xmath0-mode oscillations acted like a transducer that transformed the gravitational energy of accreted matter to the energy of out - going sound waves . in the present formulation , unfortunately , it is in principle impossible to obtain the energy that will be transferred to the out - going acoustic waves .",
    "however , we may be able to infer it as follows . in the growth phase that lasts for @xmath100100ms",
    ", the energy of accreting matter , or the work done by the external pressure perturbation in the present model , is transferred to the mode energy , as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . after saturation , on the other hand , the mode energy is almost unchanged . in this phase , then , it may be that the energy of the accreting matter is emitted just at the same rate as the accumulation rate .",
    "if this is really the case , we can estimate that the emitted energy , possibly as out - going acoustic waves , will be @xmath131erg / s , which may not be a bad estimate , provided , in general , the explosion is considerably delayed ( @xmath132500ms ) in the acoustic mechanism .",
    "it is obvious , however , that more elaborate formulation of the problem , which would include the out - going waves , is required .",
    "numerical approaches from an experimental view point will be also useful  @xcite .",
    "there are many other improvements remaining to be done .",
    "as repeated in the text , we have not attempted to make the model fully self - consistent in this paper , since the qualitative understanding of the @xmath0-mode excitations by sasi is the focus of the paper .",
    "however , the dependence of the results on the proto neutron star model , eos , the progenitor model that determines the accretion rate , and so forth should be investigated in addition to making the model more self - consistent , all of which are currently under way .",

    "<S> the so - called `` acoustic revival mechanism '' of core - collapse supernova proposed recently by the arizona group is an interesting new possibility . aiming to understand the elementary processes involved in the mechanism , we have calculated the eigen frequencies and eigen functions for the @xmath0-mode oscillations of a non - rotating proto neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-modes have relatively small eigen frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> since there is a convective region inside the proto neutron star , the eigen functions are confined either to the exterior or interior of this evanescent region although some fraction of eigen functions penetrates it because of their long wave lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the possible excitation of these modes by the standing accretion shock instability , or sasi , is discussed based on these eigen functions . </S>",
    "<S> we have formulated the forced oscillations of @xmath0-modes by the external pressure perturbations exerted on the proto neutron star surface . </S>",
    "<S> the driving pressure fluctuations have been adopted from our previous computations of the axisymmetric sasi in the non - linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> we have paid particular attention to low @xmath1 modes , since these are the modes that are dominant in sasi and that the arizona group claimed played an important role in their acoustic revival scenario . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is the index of the spherical harmonic functions , @xmath2 . although the frequency spectrum of the non - linear sasi is broadened substantially by non - linear couplings , the typical frequency is still much smaller than those of @xmath0-modes , the fact leading to a severe impedance mismatch . as a result , the excitations of various @xmath0-modes are rather inefficient and the energy of the saturated @xmath0-modes is @xmath3erg or smaller , with the @xmath4 mode being the largest in our model . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 mode has two radial nodes and is confined to the interior of the convection region . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transfer rate from the @xmath0-modes to out - going sound waves is estimated from the growth of the @xmath0-modes and found to be @xmath5erg / s in the model studied in this paper . </S>"
