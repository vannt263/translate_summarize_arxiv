    "despite their different evolutionary phases , b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) and yellow hypergiants ( yhgs ) share a number of common properties regarding their circumstellar environments . both types of stars experience phases of strongly enhanced mass - loss , and the released material accumulates in ( multiple ) shells , bipolar nebulae , and/or disc - like structures , often veiling the central object .",
    "moreover , the physical conditions in the envelopes of these stars are ideal for molecule and dust condensation .",
    "warm molecular gas is obvious from co band emission , and the dust is traced by its infrared excess emission . while the enhanced mass - loss and eruptions in yhgs are probably caused by an increased pulsation activity , the physical mechanism leading to the formation of the dense winds and keplerian discs and rings observed in b[e]sgs is yet unknown , although pulsations might play a role as well .",
    "the evolutionary state of b[e]sgs is also still unclear .",
    "based on the observed enrichment in @xmath0c in their discs , proposed that b[e]sgs have just evolved off the main sequence . on the other hand ,",
    "their dense dusty environments seem to speak in favour of a post - red supergiant ( post - rsg ) evolutionary phase .",
    "yhgs may have passed through the rsg phase and evolve back to the blue , hot side of the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) . on their journey , they encounter the yellow void region , in which their envelopes become unstable and are successively ejected during a series of outbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the progenitor stars of b[e]sgs spread over the full mass range of massive stars ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) , yhgs are only found in the mass range 25m@xmath3m@xmath2",
    "nevertheless , it has been suggested that yhgs may be evolving toward the b[e ] supergiant phase @xcite .",
    "such a possible evolutionary link in this specific mass range should be investigated .",
    "during the years 20102015 , we carried out an optical spectroscopic survey of a large sample of galactic northern emission - line stars in diverse evolutionary states ( pre - main sequence stars , classical be stars , b[e ] stars including two b[e]sgs , compact planetary nebulae , and yhgs ) .",
    "this survey was aimed at identifying characteristic emission features that help to study the structure and kinematics of dense circumstellar environments .",
    "motivated by the results from previous studies , we focused on the strategic forbidden emission lines of [ oi ] and [ caii ] , whose appearance requires high - density environments combined with large emitting volumes , conditions which are typically met in geometrically thick and dense circumstellar discs @xcite .",
    "the observations were obtained using the coud spectrograph attached to the perek 2-m telescope at ondejov observatory @xcite .",
    "spectra were taken in three different wavelength regions : around h  @xmath4 ( 62506760 , @xmath5 13000 ) , in the region of the [ caii ] @xmath67291 ,  7324 lines ( 69907500 , @xmath5 15000 ) , and in the region of the caii ir triplet ( 84708980 , @xmath5 18000 ) .",
    "the h  @xmath4 region also encloses the two [ oi ] @xmath66300 , 6364 lines .",
    ".identification of disc tracers in b[e]sgs ( top ) and yhgs ( bottom ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sgvsyhg ]    the survey contains four yhgs , which we monitor to study variations in their environments and to trace their outburst activity during their journey through the yellow void instability region .",
    "these are discussed in the following in comparison to the two b[e]sgs ( table[tab : sgvsyhg ] ) , which were presented and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the objects are listed in table[tab : sgvsyhg ] together with a brief summary of the important spectral features .",
    "portions of the optical spectra of the yhgs covering the strategic lines are shown in fig.[fig1 ] in comparison to the spectrum of the a[e]sg star 3pup .",
    "our yhg sample splits into two categories , hot and cool .",
    "we define hot yhgs as those with spectral types a outside outburst .",
    "two of our stars , v1302aql and v509cas , fall into this group , while the other two objects , @xmath7cas and v1427aql , belong to the group of cool yhgs .",
    "these are characterized by spectral types f outside outburst .",
    "we identified the [ caii ] lines in all stars of our yhg sample , but the [ oi ] lines only in the hot yhgs .",
    "in addition , only the hot yhgs display the caii triplet lines in emission . to understand this behaviour ,",
    "we recall that the upper levels , from which the [ caii ] lines emerge , are the lower levels to which the triplet lines decay . in addition , the upper levels of the forbidden lines can be populated collisionally from the ground level .",
    "the fact that we observe the triplet lines in emission only in the hot yhgs indicates that the excitation mechanism of the [ caii ] lines is different in the two groups of stars , meaning that in the cool yhgs only collisional level excitation is at work .",
    "moreover , the low effective temperature of the cool yhgs translates into a cooler temperature of the stars environment , which suppresses effective collisional population of the levels of both caii and oi .",
    "this explains why the [ caii ] lines are much weaker and the [ oi ] lines are even absent in the spectra of these stars .",
    "@xmath7cas is famous for its outbursts ( or shell episodes ) , during which the star ejects large amounts of material ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aret et al . , this volume ) , however , no large - scale nebulosity has been detected @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for v1427aql , which has a clearly detached large - scale dust shell .",
    "not much is known about the shape of the environments of these two objects on small scales .",
    "the profiles of their [ caii ] lines are single - peaked in both cool yhgs ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . hence , based on our data we have no information in the kinematics in their [ caii ] line - forming regions .",
    "the presence of both sets of forbidden lines in the two hot yhgs indicates that the physical conditions in their environments could be similar to those in the b[e]sgs .",
    "the kinematics obtained from the [ oi ] and [ caii ] line profiles of the b[e]sg stars v1478cyg and 3pup agrees with an origin of the lines in keplerian rotating rings @xcite .",
    "thus , the same scenario might also hold for the hot yhgs .",
    "the object v1302aql is surrounded by a large - scale spherical shell , a possible remnant from the previous rsg state .",
    "it is famous for its extreme infrared excess indicating large amounts of warm dust , and it loses mass at very high rate in an axisymmetric wind @xcite .",
    "moreover , a disk - like structure , embedded in the innermost shell , was proposed by , and an orientation of the star close to pole - on was suggested by @xcite",
    ". inspection of its forbidden emission lines ( fig.[fig1 ] ) reveals that all profiles are very narrow and single peaked . despite the lack of kinematical information , such profiles are in agreement with their formation in the nearly pole - on seen disk .",
    "alike @xmath7cas , v509cas displays no evidence for large - scale shells or ejecta @xcite , indicating that no high mass loss events took place prior to 500 - 1000 years ago . during the years 19601980",
    ", the star was practically the spectroscopic twin of @xmath7cas , because it displayed the same emission and absorption features , varying with the pulsation phase .",
    "it also underwent similar outbursts with the appearance of co emission , which turned into absorption and then disappeared with the expansion and dilution of the ejected material @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath7cas , from 1980 on v509cas started to gradually heat up until about 2001 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "concerning the structure of the small - scale environment , not much is currently known .",
    "the forbidden lines in our spectra ( fig.[fig1 ] ) show clearly double - peaked profiles for the [ caii ] lines , while the [ oi ] lines appear single peaked at our spectral resolution .",
    "this behaviour is also seen in the b[e]sgs and might be assigned to a ( keplerian ) rotating disc or rings , in which the [ caii ] lines are formed closer to the star than the [ oi ] @xmath86300 line .",
    "if true , v509cas would be the second yhg with clear indication for an inner disk .",
    "the fact that the hot yhgs in our sample seem to have disk - like structures , whereas the cool ones lack such evidence , might indicate a drastic change in the mass - loss behaviour during the passage of the star through the yellow void from spherical to axisymmetric mass - loss .",
    "as pulsations are believed to be the main mechanism responsible for enhanced mass loss and eruptions in yhgs , this would require a change in the pulsation habit of the stars , which might be checked based on long - term observing campaigns .    during the past few decades , v1302aql @xcite and v509cas displayed a considerable increase in their effective temperature , which seems to have slown down or even stopped .",
    "@xcite reported that the kinematic picture and effective temperature of v1302aql have been stable during 20012014 .",
    "our spectra from 2015 show that the effective temperature of v509cas has remained at the same level as in the beginning of 2001 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "these findings may indicate that these objects are approaching the high - temperature boundary of the `` first '' instability region in the yellow void .",
    "such a conclusion is in line with the current position of the stars in the hrd ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the presence of discs around these hot yhgs has further implications . as these objects will continue to lose mass during their passage through the second part of the yellow void instability domain",
    ", the accumulation of material in the equatorial plane might continue .",
    "as soon as the star will reach the blue , stable edge of the yellow void , it could have deposited enough material into the disk ( or rings ) to appear as a b[e]sg .",
    "such an evolutionary link was already suggested for v1302aql by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but in light of the new proposition of a keplerian disk or rings around v509cas based on the profile shapes of its forbidden emission lines , it seems to be a valid suggestion even for a larger sample of hot yhgs ."
