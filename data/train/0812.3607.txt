    "an important quantity characterizing the performance of a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme is the maximum amount of channel noise which can be tolerated before the protocol fails to produce a secure key .",
    "this threshold has clear implications for qkd as a potentially - realizable technology and not just as a possibility inherent in the formalism of quantum mechanics",
    ". it also relates to an important issue of principle , namely , the connection between quantum mechanics and privacy .",
    "what aspects of quantum mechanics are responsible for the possibility of key distribution and other cryptographic protocols ?",
    "determining the threshold , or at least bounding it , gives us insight into this issue .",
    "particular properties of quantum states and channels which are sufficient for generating privacy in some way lead to lower bounds , while identifying properties necessary for privacy leads to upper bounds .",
    "one such property is the symmetric extendibility of bipartite quantum states .",
    "suppose that two honest parties alice and bob share a state @xmath0 from which they would like to extract a secret key using one - way public communication from her side to his .",
    "this task is impossible should there exist a tripartite state @xmath1 such that the @xmath2 marginal state is identical to the @xmath3 marginal @xmath4 .",
    "if such a state exists it can always be chosen to be symmetric between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. ,  the state is invariant when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are swapped .",
    "such a tripartite state is called a symmetric extension of the original state , and the equality of the marginals means that the extra system @xmath6 essentially functions as a copy of system @xmath5 . assuming the worst - case scenario that an eavesdropper eve holds @xmath6 , whatever process bob uses to create an error free bit string after receiving the communication from alice",
    "can also be performed by eve , and thus the bit string can not be private @xcite .",
    "the question of symmetric extendibility is relevant in many areas of quantum information theory , from bell - inequalities @xcite to quantum channel capacity @xcite . in qkd",
    ", the necessary condition of not having a symmetric extension has been translated into upper bounds on the key rate and threshold noise rate for one way procedures in  @xcite .",
    "a considerable advantage of this approach stems from the fact that the upper bounds are determined without having to construct concrete eavesdropping attacks .",
    "moreover , for systems described by hilbert spaces of modest dimension , symmetric extensions can be efficiently constructed  when they exist  by means of semidefinite programming .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of two - way communication and use the symmetric extension to derive attack - independent upper bounds for the bb84  @xcite and six - state  @xcite schemes . at first glance ,",
    "symmetric extensions appear to be irrelevant to the problem , since the two - way nature of the communication creates an asymmetry between the honest and dishonest parties  eve can not pretend to be one of the honest parties . however , every two - way communication procedure consists of alternating rounds of one - way communication , which must eventually terminate if the protocol is to establish a secret key that can be used in other applications .",
    "the final step thus involves only one - way communication , and the question of symmetric extendibility again becomes relevant . from this point of view , it becomes clear that the goal of the two - way communication is to _ break _ any existing symmetric extension of the input state .    to avoid confusion ,",
    "we distinguish between a qkd _ protocol _ , a qkd _ scheme _ , and the various _ procedures _ such as advantage distillation , error correction , and privacy amplification . by a qkd scheme , we mean the generation of correlated data by distributing quantum particles and measuring them . for simplicity we will also include the parameter estimation and sifting in the definition of the scheme .",
    "including the sifting means that bb84 @xcite and sarg04 @xcite are different schemes , even though the signal states and measurements are the same .",
    "for a given scheme , the key distillation procedures following it can be chosen in different ways which give different thresholds .",
    "we call the whole process a qkd protocol , so that at the end of the protocol the parties have a secret key that is ready for use .    given a particular two - way procedure , then , the question of symmetric extendibility leads to an upper bound on the noise threshold given by the noisiest state for which the procedure just fails to break the extension .",
    "generally one must resort to finding an approximate symmetric extension by solving the semidefinite program numerically .",
    "for the well - known bb84  @xcite and six - state  @xcite schemes , however , the relevant states can be assumed without loss of generality to be diagonal in a basis of maximally entangled states : the so - called bell basis . by making use of the symmetries of the bell states ,",
    "we can answer the question of symmetric extendibility by solving the semidefinite program analytically , which then leads to exact upper bounds for the tolerable error rates .",
    "for the two - way procedure outlined by chau  @xcite , we show that the upper bound for the two schemes meets the lower bound given therein and that this procedure is optimal for a wide range of two - way procedures .",
    "this agrees with the results reported by acn _",
    "et  al_.  @xcite , who based their upper bound on an explicit eavesdropping attack .",
    "our results are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : se ] , we examine in detail the role played by the symmetric extension in two - way qkd protocols . in sec .  [",
    "sec : bell ] we review the formulation of the symmetric extension problem as a semidefinite program ( sdp ) , simplify , and solve it for bell - diagonal states and give an analytic expression for the boundary of extendible bell - diagonal states . section [ sec : qkd ] describes chau s two - way communication procedure and shows that above the known lower bound on the threshold , the procedure fails to break the symmetric extension and can therefore not lead to a secret key .",
    "we also discuss variations of this procedure which turn out to be equivalent for distillability . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we sum up and discuss some open questions .",
    "one goal of the portion of a qkd protocol involving two - way communication is to transform a state having a symmetric extension into one which does not . in a prepare and measure ( p&m ) scheme ,",
    "there is never an actual bipartite entangled state , but any such scheme can be modeled as an entanglement - based scheme where alice prepares an entangled state and sends half of it to bob . when alice measures her half of the entangled state , this effectively prepares the other half in one of the signal states of the p&m protocol  @xcite .",
    "eve may interfere with the transmitted signal in any manner of her choosing , so after making their respective measurements , alice and bob compare a portion of the data in order to determine  at least roughly ",
    "what particular quantum state @xmath0 they share .",
    "this state is the starting point for our analysis and is any state obeying @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the povm elements of alice s and bob s respective measurements and @xmath10 are the probabilities with which alice and bob obtain outcomes corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "any subsequent processing of the measurement data is then modeled as a coherent processing on the quantum states with any classical communication corresponding to measurement outcomes .",
    "this allows us to track the effective state throughout the protocol .",
    "now we can investigate which two - way processing procedures can break symmetric extensions . by making a few assumptions on the form of the procedure",
    ", we can simplify the problem considerably .",
    "assume that each round of one - way processing is performed on blocks with a finite number of systems , such that the output is considered as a single system in the next round . as we are not concerned with the rate of distillation ,",
    "only whether the state is at all distillable or not , we are led to the following two simplifications .",
    "first , we only need to concern ourselves with filtering operations  quantum operations defined by a single kraus operator  which do not always succeed when applied to a state .",
    "there is a corresponding kraus operator for failure , which makes the operation trace - preserving , but we discard the failure outcomes and therefore a filter is in general not trace - preserving . if @xmath0 is the state of the block before postprocessing , the unnormalized state after bob applies the filter @xmath11 is @xmath12 and the filter satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "if an operation with more than one kraus operator is able to break the symmetric extension  that is @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) has no symmetric extension  then because of convexity at least one of the @xmath16 must be without symmetric extension , so the filter @xmath17 alone will break the extension .",
    "second , we can reduce the finite number of one - way rounds to only two , for the following reason .",
    "assume that the final round of communication is from alice to bob .",
    "bob can start the procedure already at his last round by guessing ahead of time what alice s messages related to that block would have been and perform the corresponding local operations .",
    "usually this guess will be wrong and alice will tell bob to discard those blocks in the final round . for the tiny fraction of the blocks where bob guessed correctly , alice can proceed with her last round .",
    "this means that if the symmetric extension can be broken during a two - way procedure , it must also be possible to break it with a single filter on a block of copies of bob s system .",
    "bell - diagonal states are two - qubit states that are diagonal in the basis of maximally entangled states @xmath18 , @xmath19 . such states can be produced by sending half of the maximally entangled state @xmath20 through a pauli channel with error probabilities @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 errors respectively .",
    "this results in the state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 . for compactness",
    ", we will also denote this as @xmath29 where the index @xmath30 runs over the set @xmath31 or equivalently @xmath32 .    in the six - state and bb84 qkd schemes considered here",
    ", the effective quantum states describing the systems held by alice and bob can be taken to be bell diagonal for the following reason .",
    "first , alice and bob discard all data from mismatched bases , and they can assume the worst case scenario which is that the corresponding outcomes are completely uncorrelated .",
    "this implies @xmath33=0 $ ] for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the pauli operators .",
    "further , alice and bob randomly ( but jointly ) decide which state in each basis corresponds to which bit value , so the correlations in each basis are characterized by a single error rate @xmath37 for @xmath38 . from this condition",
    ", it follows that @xmath39 =   { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\rho^{ab } ( \\mathbbm{1}^a \\otimes \\sigma_i^{b } ) ] = 0 $ ] for @xmath40 , and this leaves only @xmath41 , and it is easy to verify that this means the state is bell diagonal . in the six - state scheme , there are three bases , so the corresponding error rates determine the bell - diagonal state completely . in the bb84 case ,",
    "the error rate in the @xmath42 basis is not known , leaving an equivalence class of possible states .",
    "the bell - diagonal states have a number of appealing and useful properties .",
    "for instance , it is possible to reduce any bipartite qubit state to the bell - diagonal form by `` twirling , '' choosing a pauli @xmath36 and applying @xmath43 on the state @xcite .",
    "generic two - qubit states can also be filtered to the bell - diagonal form with a two - side filtering @xcite .",
    "finally , any two - qubit state where both reduced states are maximally mixed is bell - diagonal with the right choice of local basis @xcite , and a local change of basis can also rearrange the @xmath44 in any order .    for our purposes , a parametrization different from the @xmath44 will be useful .",
    "the analysis of both symmetric extension and key distillation is simplified using the following parameters :    [ eq : alpha - transformation ] @xmath45    which gives the inverse transformation    @xmath46    because of normalization , @xmath47 for all probability vectors .",
    "so all bell - diagonal states are uniquely defined by the coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "the maximally entangled states are in these coordinates @xmath49 : @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "the convex hull of these four points is a tetrahedron , which represents the set of bell - diagonal states .",
    "this region is defined by the four inequalities @xmath53 each corresponding to a particular eigenvalue being non - negative .",
    "recall that a state @xmath0 has a symmetric extension if there exists a state @xmath1 which is such that @xmath54 = \\rho^{ab}$ ] and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the unitary operation swapping @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the question of whether or not @xmath0 has a symmetric extension can be formulated as a semidefinite program ( sdp ) @xcite : a convex optimization of a linear function over the convex cone of positive matrices .",
    "these can be efficiently solved numerically for low - dimensional systems using interior point algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the following discussion is adapted from  @xcite .",
    "consider the following maximization , a semidefinite program : @xmath57,\\nonumber\\\\ \\text{subject to } & { \\mathrm{tr}}\\ , [ \\widetilde{l}_i^{abb'}x^{abb'}]={\\mathrm{tr}}[l_i^{ab}\\rho^{ab}],\\nonumber\\\\ & x^{abb'}\\geq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free variable to be optimized , @xmath58 , is an operator on @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is a basis for traceless operators on @xmath61 .",
    "further , @xmath62 for @xmath63 the quantum operation symmetrizing systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath64 using the swap operator @xmath56 .",
    "if the optimum value of the objective function is nonnegative , a suitable multiple @xmath65 @xmath66 of @xmath67 can be added to @xmath58 in order to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath68=1 $ ] , and the extension is then given by @xmath69 .",
    "this symmetrization ensures that @xmath55 . to see that the constraints on @xmath58 in the sdp ensure that @xmath54 = \\rho^{ab}$ ] , we use the facts that for any operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we have that @xmath72 = { \\mathrm{tr}}_c[(m^{ab } \\otimes \\mathbbm{1}^c ) n^{abc}]$ ] and that for any @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 = { \\mathrm{tr } } [ \\texttt{sym}_{bc}(p^{abc})q^{abc } ] $ ] .",
    "we then get that for all @xmath76 , @xmath77\\\\ & = { \\mathrm{tr}}[(l_i^{ab } \\otimes \\mathbbm{1}^{b ' } ) \\texttt{sym}_{bb'}(x^{abb'})]\\\\ & = { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\texttt{sym}_{bb'}(l_i^{ab } \\otimes \\mathbbm{1}^{b ' } ) x^{abb'}]\\\\ & = { \\mathrm{tr}}[l_i^{ab } \\rho^{ab}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality is from the constraint of the sdp .",
    "since @xmath60 is a basis for the traceless operators on @xmath61 , we therefore have that the traceless part of @xmath78 $ ] is equal to the traceless part of @xmath0 .",
    "also , @xmath79 = { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\rho^{ab } ] = 1 $ ] , so @xmath54 = \\rho^{ab}$ ] .",
    "if the maximum value is negative , no positive semidefinite extension can be constructed because if @xmath1 were a symmetric extension of @xmath0 , the choice @xmath80 would satisfy the constraints and give the objective function a value of 0 .",
    "to every sdp , there is an associated dual sdp which for the symmetric extension problem is somewhat easier to work with . the dual of eq .",
    "is @xmath81,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eqn : primalproblem } \\text{subject to } & \\widetilde{k}^{abb'}\\geq 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are free variables to be optimized .",
    "we refer to this optimization as the _ dual problem _ and the original optimization as the _ primal problem_. should @xmath0 have a symmetric extension , @xmath85={\\mathrm{tr}}[\\widetilde{k}^{abb'}\\rho^{abb'}]\\geq 0 $ ] , since the trace of the product of two positive operators is non - negative .",
    "thus a sufficient condition for @xmath0 _ not _ to be extendible is for the minimum of @xmath85 $ ] to be negative . as we discuss below , this condition is also necessary , due to a property known as _ strong duality_.    _ weak duality _ holds that the optimum value of the primal problem is always less than the optimum of the dual , which follows from the positivity constraints , @xmath86-(1-{\\mathrm{tr}}[x^{abb'}])\\\\ = { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\widetilde{k}^{abb'}x^{abb ' } ] \\geq 0 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the equality follows from @xmath85   = { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\widetilde{k}^{abb'}\\rho^{abb ' } ] = { \\mathrm{tr}}[\\widetilde{k}^{abb'}(x^{abb ' } + t \\mathbbm{1}^{abb'})]$ ] and @xmath87 = { \\mathrm{tr}}[t \\mathbbm{1}^{abb'}]$ ] .",
    "strong duality is the statement that the optimum values of the primal and dual problems are equal .",
    "sufficient conditions for strong duality are known . in particular ,",
    "a semidefinite program is said to be _ strictly feasible _ if the constraints can be satisfied by a matrix that is positive definite rather than just positive semidefinite .",
    "the strict feasibility of either the primal or dual semidefinite programs is sufficient to guarantee strong duality ( theorem 3.1  @xcite ) .",
    "if both the primal and the dual are strictly feasible then we are also guaranteed that there exist matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 that satisfy the constraints and attain the optimum of the primal and dual program , respectively , ( theorem 3.1  @xcite ) .",
    "the dual problem is obviously strictly feasible just by taking @xmath90 . on the primal side ,",
    "note that there must be some , not necessarily positive , @xmath58 meeting the constraints , since these underdetermine the components . as the constraints only involve the traceless part of @xmath58 , a suitable multiple of the identity @xmath67",
    "can always be added to ensure positivity . from strict feasibility",
    ", we obtain the sufficiency condition that @xmath91)>0 $ ] implies @xmath0 is extendible which defines a hyperplane in the set of positive operators separating the given state @xmath0 from the convex set of extendible states @xcite .",
    "strict feasibility implies that we only need to consider hermitian @xmath92 for which @xmath93 . ] .",
    "moreover , when the optima are equal , @xmath94=0 $ ] , and hence @xmath95",
    ". this condition is termed _ complementary slackness _ and will play an important role in the analytical solution .",
    "now consider the dual form of the sdp , [ eq .  ( [ eq : sdpdual ] ) ] . by exploiting the symmetry of the problem",
    ", we can find an analytic solution .",
    "the method for dealing with symmetry follows the general prescription of gatermann and parrilo  @xcite , but takes advantage of several special properties of this problem . because @xmath0 is bell diagonal , it is invariant under conjugation by pauli operators @xmath96 .",
    "this induces a symmetry of the objective function , since @xmath97={\\mathrm{tr}}[k\\rho]$ ] for any @xmath98 . moreover , the constraint @xmath99 is equivalent to @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the set of allowable @xmath11 is invariant under arbitrary conjugation by pauli operators and since they all yield the same value of the objective function , we can focus on those formed by the convex combination @xmath101 without loss of generality . since @xmath102 is a `` twirl '' of @xmath11 , it is also bell diagonal : @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath104 satisfy @xmath105 , since @xmath106 = { \\mathrm{tr}}[(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\sigma_i)k(\\sigma_i \\otimes \\sigma_i)^\\dagger ] = 1 $ ] , but not necessarily @xmath107 .",
    "this simplifies the objective function @xmath85 $ ] to @xmath108 with the additional constraint @xmath109 .",
    "next , we would like to use the symmetry of @xmath102 to simplify the constraint @xmath110 .",
    "for readability , we will  in this and the next two paragraphs  write the pauli operators as @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , and tensor products such as @xmath114 as @xmath115 . observe that @xmath116 inherits invariance under the operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 from @xmath102 .",
    "we can simplify the calculation by observing that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are logical operators for the bit - flip code .",
    "because of the symmetry , it will be necessary for @xmath116 to be proportional to the identity on the code space .",
    "@xmath116 has a symmetry under swapping @xmath5 and @xmath6 that we will also wish to take advantage of .",
    "we can proceed by identifying three `` logical '' or encoded qubits @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 on the hilbert space @xmath122 , such that the form of @xmath116 is simpler when expressed in the computational basis of @xmath123 .",
    "the encoded @xmath111- and @xmath113-operators on the logical qubits are @xmath124 note that with these definitions swapping @xmath5 and @xmath6 induces a swap on @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is simple to verify that the pauli operators on different logical qubits commute and that @xmath111 and @xmath113 anticommute on the same logical qubit .",
    "they therefore define a valid encoding , and the encoded product vectors @xmath125 are the eight simultaneous eigenvectors of the encoded @xmath113 operators , @xmath126    since @xmath116 is invariant under the operators @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we can immediately infer that @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath116 is by definition invariant under swapping the @xmath128 systems , and swapping @xmath128 is the same as swapping @xmath129 .",
    "this means that @xmath130 must be block diagonal with the support on the triplet and singlet subspaces .",
    "since @xmath102 is bell diagonal and @xmath63 is a linear superoperator , we can write @xmath131 . converting the terms @xmath132 into operators on the logical qubits can be accomplished by writing it out in the computational basis and using the relations .    alternatively , the conversion can be done by noticing that @xmath133 and @xmath134 are encoded @xmath113 and @xmath111 operators for logical qubits @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath135 is on the + 1 eigenspace of both @xmath136 and @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 . for @xmath139",
    ", we use that @xmath140 = @xmath141 , and since @xmath142 commutes ( anticommutes ) with @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath140 is on the @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) eigenspace of @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 . similarly , @xmath146 and @xmath147 correspond to @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . applying the swap symmetrization @xmath63 to @xmath150",

    "first , each of the terms has the form @xmath151 , where @xmath152 has support only on the triplet subspace .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the @xmath153 matrices are given by @xmath154 in the basis @xmath155 .",
    "the semidefinite program now becomes @xmath156 where @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath159 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the latter constraint can be eliminated by a further change of variables according to eq .   for both @xmath160 and @xmath161 , so that @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the latter constraint now becomes simply @xmath164 , and only @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 remain as free variables .",
    "the objective function becomes @xmath168 . instead of minimizing this directly ,",
    "we multiply by 4 and subtract the constant term @xmath169 .",

    "because of the minimization , finding an @xmath172 that satisfies the constraints and such that the objective function is less than @xmath144 is sufficient to show that the state does not have a symmetric extension",

    "for the two vectors @xmath218 , this gives the two possible matrices @xmath219 since the second column is proportional to the first , the matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if the lower right @xmath209 block is .",

    "if on the other hand , one or more of the constraints are satisfied , there is no contradiction and the state could have a symmetric extension .",

    "the @xmath113 which is positive semidefinite will therefore satisfy all the constraints of the primal sdp , and since it gives a value of the objective function which is less than or equal to @xmath176 , the state must have a symmetric extension .    altogether , we have shown that if any of the conditions , , or are satisfied , the state has a symmetric extension , otherwise it does not .",

    "the two - way procedure to distill secret key from quantum correlations in a prepare and measure scheme invented by gottesman and lo @xcite was proven by chau @xcite to work for bell - diagonal states with error rates that satisfy @xmath231 this corresponds to a quantum bit error rate ( qber ) of 27.64% for the six - state scheme ( @xmath232 ) and 20% for bb84 ( @xmath233 , @xmath234 ) . in this section ,",

    "if the parity is equal , the first pair is kept .",
    "this step requires two - way communication since both parties need to know if they should keep the first pair .",
    "the p - step works on three bit pairs .",
    "the output bit on each side is the parity of the three bits .",
    "this does not require any communication at all , but it simulates a phase error correction step where two qubits are measured to give a phase error syndrome which is sent from alice to bob for comparison .",

    "they keep the first bit if all the parities are equal , otherwise they discard the block .",
    "given the announced parities , there are only two possible bit strings compatible with the announcements , namely , the correct string and the inverted string .",
    "it is easy to see that when the block size for cad is @xmath294 , it is equivalent to @xmath295 successful rounds of b - steps ( when the whole block is discarded if any of the b - steps fail ) . to make sure that even for @xmath296 cad can not break symmetric extension for any states",
    "were b - steps fail , we can compute the output state after cad .",
    "the input state is @xmath293 copies of a bell - diagonal state , which we think of as a maximally entangled state @xmath20 which has a probability @xmath160 for having suffered a @xmath36 error on bob s qubit .",
    "the output qubit has a bit error ( either @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) iff all the qubits in the block had a bit error and it has no bit error iff no qubit in the block had a bit error .",
    "the other bit error patterns are detected and the block is discarded .",
    "the output qubit has a phase error ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) if an odd number of input qubits had a phase error , and no phase error if an even number of input qubits had a phase error .",

    "this gives the following generalization of eqs .",
    ":    @xmath305    where the sum of these probabilities gives the probability for cad to succeed . from this",
    ", it follows directly that @xmath306 , so having the liberty to choose block sizes other than @xmath307 does not help if @xmath242 .",
    "another observation is that the announcement of any @xmath308 independent parity bits on a block of @xmath293 bits is equivalent to performing cad on a subset of @xmath309 of those bits .",
    "this can be seen simply by counting the number of possible strings . on the block of @xmath293 bits , there are @xmath310 possible strings .",
    "each announced parity bit halves this number , so after @xmath308 parity bits there are only two possible strings left .",
    "any bits that are equal in the two strings are therefore completely revealed by the announcement .",
    "the remaining @xmath311 bits are all different and the cad on those @xmath311 bits is the same as announcing that we have one of those possible substrings .",
    "hence , nothing that generates a bit from @xmath293 bits by announcing @xmath308 independent parity bits can break the symmetric extension .",
    "we have characterized the bell - diagonal states that have a symmetric extension . using this",
    "we have shown that the failure of chau s procedure to distill key from certain entangled states can be understood in terms of failure to break a symmetric extension .",
    "also , some simple variations of the b - steps are shown to be equivalent with respect to distillability .",
    "the natural question now is if any other modification of the procedure can distill key from these states .",
    "bae and acn @xcite attempted to improve the thresholds by adding noise in the beginning of the procedure , allowing coherent quantum operation on one side or measuring in a different basis , but without success .",
    "portmann  @xcite investigated bb84 with the bit error detection using random parities but could only prove security up to a qber of 16.9% .",
    "we believe that the symmetric extension can be a useful tool for narrowing down which type of postprocessing , if any , can distill a secret key beyond current thresholds .    in the analysis , we have depended on the fact that the state after sifting can be considered to be bell - diagonal , when one only considers the quantum bit error rate in the different bases . while the state really is bell - diagonal for a pauli channel , it may be different in general and this would show up as correlations in the data where alice and bob measure in different bases . for other protocols , such as sarg04 @xcite and protocols based on spherical codes  @xcite , the sifting works as a filter so the state will not be bell diagonal even for a pauli channel . in these cases , the twirling procedure may actually turn a state without symmetric extension into one that has .",
    "any two - qubit pure state can be written in the bell - basis @xmath312 and by choosing @xmath313 , twirling will give a bell - diagonal state with eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "if those @xmath44 are chosen such that the bell - diagonal state has symmetric extension and the pure state is not a product state , the twirling will introduce a symmetric extension that was not there to begin with .",
    "the most extreme example of this is when @xmath314 .",
    "then the pure state is maximally entangled and since the correlations are in the wrong bases , the twirled state is maximally mixed .",
    "a natural question is then what we can say about the symmetric extension for more general states , and this will be considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
