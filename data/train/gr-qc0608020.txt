    "each of these is an algebraic condition restricting the spin tensor to have 3 fewer independent components .",

    "furthermore , since we are interested in the massless limit of the mathisson - papapetrou equations , and since the mass of the particle is defined by @xmath15 , the massless limit would imply @xmath16 , so we assume this to be true here .",
    "mashhoon @xcite found tulczyjew s condition @xmath7 to be inconsistent if @xmath17 is also null : @xmath18 . while we could examine this condition for the nonnull case",

    "for example , tod , de felice and calvani @xcite consider @xmath17 to be timelike assuming that it represents the total energy - momentum of the particle while they do not impose any causality condition on the world line @xmath9 , which plays the role of a mere mathematical tool \" to perform the multipole reduction ; on the other hand according to mashhoon @xcite , @xmath17 can be considered to be analogous to a canonical momentum for the particle , in which case there is no reason to prefer a particular causality character for it , while the world line @xmath9 must be timelike in the massive case or null in the massless case because it is a world line intimately associated with the test particle location .",
    "this uncertainty in the model itself , i.e. , the uncertainty in the sc , has to be considered as a limitation of our description of spinning test particles in general relativity .",

    "note that the spin vector depends on the scale of @xmath8 and hence on the parametrization chosen for the null world lines to which it is tangent .    in the present paper , using the newman - penrose ( np ) formalism , we derive the equations of motion for a massless spinning test particle in any algebraically special vacuum spacetime for the special case in which the multipole reduction world line is aligned with a principal null direction of the spacetime .",
    "this leads to very simple equations which are straightforward to solve .",
    "explicit solutions corresponding to some familiar petrov type d and type n spacetimes ( including the schwarzschild , kerr , c metric , kasner , and single exact gravitational wave spacetimes ) are derived and discussed . finally , motion along null circular orbits is also studied and explicit solutions in black hole spacetimes are presented .",
