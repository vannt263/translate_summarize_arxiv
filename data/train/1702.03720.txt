    "the mu2e experiment at fnal  @xcite aims to observe the charged - lepton flavor violating neutrinoless conversion of a negative muon into an electron . the conversion results in a monochromatic electron with an energy slightly below the muon rest mass ( 104.97 mev ) .",
    "two major elements of the detector system are the straw tube tracker and the crystal calorimeter . the calorimeter  @xcite should confirm that the candidates reconstructed by the extremely precise tracker system are indeed conversion electrons while performing a powerful @xmath2/e particle identification .",
    "moreover , it can provide a seed for the track search and a high level trigger for the experiment independently from the tracker system .",
    "the calorimeter should also keep functionality in the highest irradiated areas where the background delivers a dose of about 100 krad and a fluence of about 10@xmath3 neutrons/@xmath4 1-mev@xmath5 in the hottest area , while working in the presence of a 1 t axial magnetic field .",
    "these requirements translate to a design of a calorimeter with large acceptance , good energy resolution o(5@xmath6 ) and a reasonable position ( time ) resolution better than 1 cm ( 0.5 ns ) .",
    "the baseline version of the calorimeter is composed of two disks of inner ( outer ) radius of 37.4 ( 66.0 ) cm assembled from about 1350 undoped csi crystals of @xmath7 @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "each crystal is read out by two large area silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) arrays .",
    "the undoped csi emission spectrum peaks at 310 nm with a decay time constant of about 30 ns  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the undoped csi are a reasonable match to the mu2e requirements : light yield ( 2000 photons / mev ) , radiation length ( 1.9 cm ) and molire radius ( 3.6 cm ) .",
    "time resolution better than 0.5 ns has been recently measured with an undoped csi calorimeter at 100 mev using a pmt - based readout combined with a signal waveform digitization at 125 msps  @xcite .",
    "the tests discussed in this paper are motivated by the development of a new generation of uv - extended sipm  @xcite from hamamatsu that improves the photo - detection efficiency ( pde ) close to the peak in the wavelength emission spectrum of undoped csi .",
    "this is obtained by replacing the epoxy resin with a silicon protection layer .",
    "a dedicated beam test was carried out during april 2015 at the beam test facility ( btf ) in frascati ( italy ) where time and energy measurements have been performed using a low energy electron beam , in the energy range [ 80,120 ] mev .",
    "the calorimeter prototype consisted of nine @xmath9  @xmath8 undoped csi crystals wrapped in 150 @xmath2 m of tyvek^^ , arranged into a @xmath0 matrix . out of the nine crystals ,",
    "two were produced by filar optomaterials  @xcite , while the remaining 7 came from isma  @xcite .",
    "each crystal was previously tested with a @xmath10na source to determine its light output ( lo ) and longitudinal response uniformity ( lru ) , with the results  @xcite :    * a lo of about 90 pe / mev , when read out with a uv - extended pmt r2059 by hamamatsu  @xcite coupled through an air gap ; * a lru corresponding to a lo variation at both ends of the crystals less than @xmath11 .",
    "each crystal was coupled to a large area @xmath12 mm@xmath13 spl tsv sipm ( mppc ) from hamamatsu  @xcite by means of the rhodorsil 7 silicon paste  @xcite .",
    "spl stands for `` silicon protection layer '' , while tsv for `` through silicon via '' and indicates a new technique used for building the sipm that is characterized by a lower noise and a higher fill - factor .",
    "the operating voltage was set at 55 v for each mppc , about 3 v above the breakdown voltage , corresponding to an average gain of @xmath14 and a pde of about @xmath15 at 300 nm .",
    "each mppc is composed of an array of 16 single sipm , each one read out with its own anode .",
    "a front - end electronics ( fee ) board was developed to form an analog sum of the pulses from several anodes .",
    "this board provides also a local hv regulation and an amplification by a factor of 8 .",
    "photosensor signals coming from the crystals and from a pair of scintillating counters used for triggering were read out with 12 bit , 250 msps waveform digitizer boards , v1720 from caen  @xcite .",
    "the coincidence of the signals from two @xmath16  @xmath8 plastic scintillating counters , crossed at 90 degrees , was used for triggering on the incoming beam .",
    "in addition , another coincidence of the signals from two @xmath17 @xmath8 scintillating counters , one above and one below the array as shown in figure  [ fig : setup ] , was used to provide a cosmic ray trigger .",
    "two configurations , schematically shown in figure  [ fig : configurations ] , were studied during the test :    1 .",
    "beam at 0 degrees with respect to the prototype front face , defined as the side opposite to the photosensors ; 2 .",
    "beam at 50 degrees with respect to the prototype surface .        configuration ( ii ) was motivated by the fact that the expected average incidence angle of a signal electron in mu2e is about 50 degrees . with the prototype rotated by 50 degrees",
    ", data were taken in three different beam impact points , as shown in figure  [ scan_50_deg ] :    * on the edge of the crystal ( 1 , 0 ) ; * 7.7 mm from the edge ; * 15.4 mm from the edge .        the channel numbering convention used in the analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : crystal - numbering ] .",

    "the target attenuates the intensity and , in cooperation with a slit system and a bending dipole , allows to select various configurations of energy and intensity . in our test",
    ", we reduced the intensity to provide an average multiplicity of 0.8 e@xmath19 per pulse in the 80 - 120 mev region .",
    "the btf repetition rate is 50 hz , with a bunch width of around 10 ns .",
    "the beam energy spread is excellent at high energy but degrades at lower energies . in our previous test  @xcite , we have measured an energy spread of 4.5% at 100 mev . for the result reported here",

    "a waveform sampling readout with 250 msps allows an accurate analysis of the signals , which is useful in mu2e to resolve the pileup of hits . the total charge and the time of the detected pulses were reconstructed as follows .",
    "the charge was estimated by numerical integration of the waveform ; two time windows of 400 ns were used as integration gates in order to guarantee the full integration of the signals .",
    "the first gate was used to estimate the pedestal @xmath25 at early time , where no pulses were present , while the second gate , around the signal peak , was used to integrate the signal charge @xmath26 .",

    "the scintillating counters had signals with a leading edge of about 15 ns ( 3 digitized samples ) , and a total width shorter than 100 ns . since the asymmetric log - normal",
    "is defined by 4 parameters , the fit range should be wider than 15 ns .",
