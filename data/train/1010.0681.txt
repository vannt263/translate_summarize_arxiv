    "in recent years , there has been considerable interest in string cosmology .",
    "cosmic strings are topologically stable objects which might be found during a phase transition in the early universe ( kibble @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic strings play an important role in the study of the early universe .",
    "these arise during the phase transition after the big bang explosion as the temperature goes down below some critical temperature as predicted by grand unified theories ( zeldovich et al .",
    "@xcite ; kibble @xcite ; everett @xcite ; vilenkin @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed that cosmic strings give rise to density perturbations which lead to the formation of galaxies ( zeldovich @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations suggest that cosmic strings can not be wholly responsible for either the cmb fluctuations or the observed clustering of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cosmic strings have stress - energy , and couple to the gravitational field .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the gravitational effects that arise from strings .",
    "the pioneering work in the formulation of the energy - momentum tensor for classical massive strings was done by letelier @xcite who considered the massive strings to be formed by geometric strings with particle attached along its extension .",
    "first used this idea in obtaining cosmological solutions in bianchi - i and kantowski - sachs space - times .",
    "stachel @xcite has studied massive string .",
    "the present day universe is satisfactorily described by homogeneous and isotropic models given by the frw space - time .",
    "but at smaller scales , the universe is neither homogeneous and isotropic nor do we expect the universe in its early stages to have these properties .",
    "homogeneous and anisotropic cosmological models have been widely studied in the framework of general relativity in the search of a realistic picture of the universe in its early stages . although these are more restricted than the inhomogeneous models which explain a number of observed phenomena quite satisfactorily .",
    "a spatially homogeneous bianchi model necessarily has a three - dimensional group , which acts simply transitively on space - like three - dimensional orbits .",
    "here we confine ourselves to models of bianchi - ii .",
    "asseo and sol @xcite emphasized the importance of bianchi type - ii universe .",
    "bianchi type - ii space - time has a fundamental role in constructing cosmological models suitable for describing the early stages of evolution of universe .",
    "roy and banerjee @xcite have dealt with locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) cosmological models of bianchi type - ii representing clouds of geometrical as well as massive strings . wang @xcite studied the letelier model in the context of lrs bianchi type - ii space - time .",
    "recently , pradhan et al . @xcite and amirhashchi and",
    "zainuddin @xcite obtained lrs bianchi type ii cosmological models with perfect fluid distribution of matter and string dust , respectively .",
    "belinchon @xcite studied bianchi type - ii space - time in connection with massive cosmic string and perfect fluid models with time varying constants under the self - similarity approach respectively .",
    "recently , tyagi and sharma @xcite have investigated string cosmological models in bianchi type - ii space - time .    motivated by the above discussions , in this paper",
    ", we have investigated a new class of bianchi type - ii cosmological models for a cloud of strings by using the law of variation for generalized mean hubble s parameter .",
    "this approach is different from what the other authors have adapted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the metric and the field equations are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 deals with exact solutions of the field equations with cloud of strings .",
    "physical behavior of the derived model is elaborated in detail . finally , in section 4 , concluding remarks are given .",
    "we consider totally anisotropic bianchi type - ii line element , given by @xmath0 where the metric potentials @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of @xmath4 alone .",
    "this ensures that the model is spatially homogeneous .",
    "the einstein s field equations ( in gravitational units @xmath5 ) read as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the einstein tensor .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath8 for a cloud of massive strings and perfect fluid distribution is taken as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the isotropic pressure ; @xmath11 is the proper energy density for a cloud strings with particles attached to them ; @xmath12 is the string tension density ; @xmath13 is the four - velocity of the particles , and @xmath14 is a unit space - like vector representing the direction of string .",
    "the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath14 satisfy the conditions @xmath16    choosing @xmath14 parallel to @xmath17 , we have @xmath18    here the cosmic string has been directed along z - direction in order to satisfy the condition @xmath19 . as a result , the off - diagonal component of einstein tensor , viz .",
    ", @xmath20 vanishes . a detailed analysis about the choice of energy - momentum tensor for bianchi type - ii models",
    "is given by saha @xcite .",
    "if the particle density of the configuration is denoted by @xmath21 , then @xmath22    the einstein s field equations ( [ eq1a ] ) for line element ( [ eq1 ] ) with energy - momentum tensor ( [ eq2 ] ) , lead to the following set of independent differential equations : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26    here , and in what follows , an over dot indicates ordinary differentiation with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the energy conservation equation @xmath27 , leads to the following expression : @xmath28 which is a consequence of the field equations ( [ eq7])-([eq10 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq7])-([eq10 ] ) are four equations in six unknown parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "two additional constraints relating these parameters are required to obtain explicit solutions of the system .",
    "first , we utilize the special law of variation for the hubble s parameter given by berman @xcite , which yields a constant value of deceleration parameter . here",
    ", the law reads as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants .",
    "such type of relations have already been considered by berman and gomide @xcite for solving frw models .",
    "later on , many authors ( see , kumar and singh @xcite , akarsu and kilinc @xcite and references therein ) have studied flat frw and bianchi type models by using the special law for hubble s parameter that yields constant value of deceleration parameter .    considering @xmath32 as the average scale factor of the anisotropic bianchi - ii space - time , the average hubble s parameter may be written as @xmath33    equating the right hand sides of ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , and integrating , we obtain @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants of integration .",
    "thus , the law ( [ eq13 ] ) provides power - law ( [ eq16 ] ) and exponential - law ( [ eq17 ] ) of expansion of the universe .    following pradhan and chouhan @xcite",
    ", we assume that the component @xmath38 of the shear tensor @xmath39 is proportional to the expansion scalar ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this condition leads to the following relation between the metric potentials : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive constant .",
