    "@xcite reported dft cluster calculations for mean , which nicely showed the saturated of the free nh - vibrations with increasing cluster size . for reasons discussed above the failure of the ff simulation in predicting the ir spectrum does not come unexpectedly",

    "overall , dftb performed rather well in describing the potential energy surface related to hb motion in tean . in gas as well as liquid phase ,",
    "dftb potential energy curves along the nh - bond coordinate have been rather close to high - level ccsd(t ) data in the thermally accessible range .",
    "further , comparison with dft results for a hexamer cluster yielded a favorable agreement in bond distance correlations , which supports the conclusion that dftb reliably describes the energetics of a wider range of hb geometries .",
    "based on these encouraging findings , dftb liquid phase md simulations have been performed and compared to results obtained using an established force field .",
    "geometric correlations between bond distances of the hb were analyzed within an approach widely used by limbach and coworkers , which is based on pauling s bond order theory .",
    "the distribution of hb geometries indicated weak correlations , thus pointing to a medium to weak hb . interestingly",
    "the bond order parameters are not much different from those obtained for nho hbs of non - ionic systems .",
    "in contrast ff simulations did not show any signature of correlations .",
    "concerning ir spectra , ff and dftb results show rather pronounced differences , which can be traced to the poor description of the potential energy surface provided by the force field .",
    "dftb spectra have been disentangled according to contributions from strongly and flexibly h - bonded ion pairs . in the spectral range of the nh - stretching vibrations",
    "this yielded a bimodal distribution of intensities according to the hb strength . in the total absorption spectrum",
    "the nh - stretching features are hidden underneath the ethyl and methyl group absorption .",
    "an even more pronounced bimodal behavior has been found in the far ir region .",
