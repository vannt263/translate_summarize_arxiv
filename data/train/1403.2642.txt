    "data - driven materials science has gained considerable traction over the last decade or so .",
    "this is due to the confluence of three key factors : 1 ) improved computational methods and tools ; 2 ) greater computational power ; and 3 ) heightened awareness of the power of extensive databases in science @xcite .",
    "the recent materials genome initiative ( mgi ) @xcite reflects the recognition that many important social and economic challenges of the 21st century could be solved or mitigated by advanced materials .",
    "computational materials science currently presents the most promising path to the resolution of these challenges .",
    "the first and second factors above are epitomized by _",
    "high - throughput _ computation of materials properties by _ ab initio _ methods , which is the foundation of an effective approach to materials design and discovery @xcite .",
    "recently , the software used to both manage the calculation work - flow and perform the analyses have trended toward more public and user - friendly frameworks .",
    "the emphasis is increasingly on portability and sharing of tools and data @xcite .",
    "similar to the effort presented here , the _ materials - project _ @xcite has been providing open access to its database of computed materials properties through a restful api and a _ python _ library enabling ad - hoc applications @xcite .",
    "other examples of online databases for materials properties include that being implemented by the engineering virtual organization for cyber design ( evocd ) @xcite , which contains a repository of experimental data , materials constants and computational tools for use in integrated computational material engineering ( icme ) .",
    "the future advance of computational materials science would rely on interoperable and federatable tools and databases as much as on the quantities and types of data being produced .",
    "a principle of high - throughput materials science is that one does not know _ a priori _ where the value of the data lies for any specific application .",
    "trends and insights are deduced _ a posteriori_. this requires efficient interfaces to interrogate available data on various levels . we have developed a simple web - based api to greatly improve the accessibility and utility of the aflowlib database @xcite to the scientific community . through it ,",
    "the client can access calculated physical properties ( thermodynamic , crystallographic , or mechanical properties ) , as well as simulation provenance and runtime properties of the included systems . the data may be used directly ( e.g. , to browse a class of materials with a desired property ) or integrated into higher level work - flows .",
    "the interface also allows for the sharing of updates of data used in previous published works , e.g. , previously calculated alloy phase diagrams , thus the database can be expanded systematically .",
    "[ fig1 ]     the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the aflowlib libraries are presented in section [ aflowlibraries ] .",
    "a new materials identifier constructed to navigate the libraries is introduced in section [ materials_identifier ] .",
    "the data provenance and access format schemes are explained in sections [ data_provenance ] and [ data_formatting ] .",
    "the access syntax and its various options are described in section [ table_properties ] .",
    "a few examples for the use of the api and two computer scripts are given in section [ examples ] .",
    "the strategy for updates is mentioned in section [ updates ] . a brief conclusion is included in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "at its core , aflowlib consists of a coordinated set of libraries of first - principles data describing thermodynamic , structural , and other materials properties of alloy systems ( figure 1 ) . from the top , it is administered through a large sql database @xcite organized in _ layers _",
    "( reminiscent of other more developed computer interfaces , i.e. , ieee - posix @xcite ) .",
    "each layer consists of searchable entries called ` aflowlib.out ` . the sql interface is called the _ zero - layer _ ( figure 2 ) because of its structural immanence .    in this _",
    "layered _ organization , each ` aflowlib.out ` can be the child of an ` aflowlib.out`-parent or the parent of an ` aflowlib.out`-child .",
    "each ` aflowlib.out ` is identified by a name and an address .",
    "the first is the auid ( flowlib nique entifier  ` $ auid ` ) , while the second is the aurl ( flowlib niform esource ocator  `",
    "$ aurl ` ) .",
    "the structure is summarized in figure 1 .",
    "the current implementation of aflowlib includes three layers that can be navigated using control keywords and absolute paths .",
    "* _ project - layer .",
    "_ this layer contains information about the project to which the data belongs .",
    "for example , for searches in alloys , the project s aurl could be of the type ` server : aflowdata/ ` followed by lib1_raw , lib1_lib , lib2_raw , lib2_lib , lib3_raw , or lib3_lib corresponding to the single element , binary and ternary libraries of post- or pre - processed data respectively . for http access @xcite , the aurl would be translated from ` $ aurl = server:/directory/ ` into ` $ web = http://server / directory/ ` .",
    "other translations are considered for future implementations .",
    "an example of ` aflowlib.out ` for the _ project - layer _ is depicted in figure 3(a ) ( with ` server = aflowlib.duke.edu ` ) . * _ set - layer .",
    "_ this layer contains information about one or more systems calculated in one or more different configurations ( e.g. , various structural prototypes , different unit cells required for phonons calculations using the finite difference method , etc . ) .",
    "an example of ` aflowlib.out ` for the _ set - layer _ is depicted in figure 3(b ) . to facilitate reproducibility , species making up",
    "the ` $ aurl ` might include a subscript or postfix indicating the pseudopotential type .",
    "for example , in searches in this layer where the user is interested in the ag - ti system , the aurl could be of the type $ aurl = server : aflowdata / lib2_raw / agti_sv/. here the `` ` _ sv ` '' in ` ti_sv ` indicates the `` sv '' type of pseudopotential in the quantum code used for the calculation , in this case vasp @xcite .",
    "other identifiers may be used to indicate pseudopotentials used in , for example , quantum espresso ( qe ) @xcite or for potentials coming from other ultrasoft pseudopotential libraries @xcite . *",
    "_ calculation - layer .",
    "_ this layer contains information about one system calculated in one particular configuration ( e.g.  agti in configuration ` $ prototype=66 ` ( c11@xmath0 @xcite ) ) . for entries in this layer ,",
    "the aurl could be of the type $ aurl = server : aflowdata / lib2_raw / agti_sv/66/. this ` $ aurl ` points to an ` aflowlib.out ` describing this specific structure properties .",
    "an example of ` aflowlib.out ` for the _ calculation - layer _ is depicted in figure 3(c ) . the calculated geometry ( here `` ` 66 ` '' ) is one of the strings comprising the aflow prototypes database .",
    "the prototypes database acts as a look - up table to common _ strukturbericht _ designations @xcite and may also refer to geometries included in the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", a legitimate entry would be something like ` ... /agti_sv",
    "/ icsd_58369.ab/ ` , where the structure composed of ag and ti is calculated in the configuration defined by ` $ prototype = icsd_58369 ` , and the postfix ` .ab ` indicates the species ordering : e.g. ` .ab ` or ` .ba ` for ag and ti in ` a``b ` or ` b``a ` positions , respectively . for ternaries the postfix is a combination of ` a , b ,",
    "c ` , where indices can be repeated to create binaries ( e.g.  ` aab ` ) .",
    "furthermore , the non - element ` x ` can be included to indicate vacancies in sublattices ( e.g. from heusler to half - heusler systems @xcite ) .",
    "valid ` $ prototype ` choices also include strings of the type `` ` f123 ` '' following the enumeration scheme of hart and forcade @xcite . here the characters ` f ` , ` b ` , ` h ` , ` s ` indicate cc , cc , cp , and imple cubic structures respectively .",
    "the number that follows designates the enumerated prototype .",
    "the complete list of structure designations can be accessed with the command `` aflow --protos '' or by consulting the online links .",
    "the options are illustrated in the aflow manual @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that while the operations of concatenating ` strings ` to ` $ aurl ` are reminiscent of a unix computer file - system , the final ` $ aurl ` is not necessarily served as a directory or a file .",
    "in fact , a _ computer daemon _ ( process running in background ) dynamically serves multiple file - system directories for the same http - translated ` $ aurl ` .",
    "the implementation was so chosen in order to better use the _ calculation - layer _ data belonging to different _ project - layers _ and to allow an ` $ aurl ` to contain multiple servers : e.g. $ aurl = server1,server2:somewhere1/agti_sv/,somewhere2/agti_sv/. in future updates of the aflowlib.org api , the latter collection will allow users to download agti s data from ` server1 ` and ` server2 ` concurrently and transparently .",
    "[ fig2 ]     [ fig3 ]",
    "following the spirit of the digital object identifier ( doi ) @xcite every entry in our database is identified by an alpha - numeric string called an auid ( flowlib nique entifier  ` $ auid ` ) . in future publications , we will use the auid as a permanent string to the correct aurl , which might get relocated across servers . by giving a short auid",
    ", the user can identify 1 ) web locations for the deliverables , 2 ) appropriate points of contact ( name , emails or other means of identifying corresponding authors ) , and 3 ) copyright and publication date .",
    "we have chosen this linked approach so that future databases and expansions of the current ones ( e.g. , locations , servers , personnel , etc . ) will not affect the retrieval of the objects .",
    "a simple web - form will be offered to the community to insert auids and to retrieve the information .",
    "the auid is constructed from a 64-bit crc checksum ( cyclic redundancy check @xcite ) of concatenated input and output files .",
    "for example , the bcc ag - ti structure ` 66 ` described above would be accessed using the auid `` $ auid = aflow:448e178e19e9e973 '' .",
    "the negligible probability of duplicates with this checksum length , and the opportunity of adding a  void character \" to the input files ( a grain of salt ) guarantee the uniqueness of the auid and its expandibility for many years to come .",
    "we welcome other groups to set up versions of auids and to communicate with us the necessary identification data so that our consortium can offer web links to entries beyond the ones prepared by its current members .",
    "reproducibility is a key tenet of the scientific method , but replication occurs rarely . as experiments become more complex and costly this problem will only worsen .",
    "a particular advantage of simulated experiments is that they are uniquely suited for reproducibility .",
    "imagine a scenario in which the original experimenter publishes his / her executable workflow with the necessary input data .",
    "then , anyone wishing to validate or build upon those results does so with a single command on a system with access to the appropriate software .",
    "this could be done so that all the software tools , input and output data are maintained remotely , lowering cost , improving ecological sustainability ( saving electricity ) and increasing collaboration .",
    "in reality , such a framework is not yet available and its implementation is not so straightforward . despite the potential advantages of computational science in the realm of reproducibility ,",
    "the crucial data provenance is often completely neglected . an overall culturally - driven disincentive to the actual reproduction of experiments",
    "is pervasive .",
    "fortunately there are indications that this problem is being recognized and addressed @xcite .",
    "aflowlib data is reproducibly structured  the workflow and input parameters",
    "are defined by the aflow software and a single master input file ` aflow.in ` , leading to easily reproducible input parameters . in the case of density functional theory - based simulations ,",
    "this includes essential calculation parameters such as the * k*-mesh density , the energy cut - off , the exchange correlation potential , the _ ab initio _",
    "software used , and the geometry of the structures . combining the parameters contained in this file with other provenance related data ( calculation time , memory , code , etc . ) , the aflow - api provides _ curated and reproducible data_.",
    "data access can be obtained at any level through the api with the appropriate aurl strings , currently translated into web inquiries .",
    "web forms such as the one shown in fig 2 allow the user to search within a project for data fitting specified criteria .",
    "alternatively , access through the api is supported by several data formats : `` html '' @xcite , `` json '' @xcite , `` dump '' , `` php '' @xcite , `` text '' , and `` none '' .",
    "* `` html '' * ( default ) : $ aurl/?format = html .",
    "* `` json '' * ( javascript syntax ) : $ aurl/?format = json .",
    "* `` dump '' * ( php constructs ) : $ aurl/?format = dump .",
    "* `` php '' * ( valid php syntax ) : $ aurl/?format = php .",
    "* `` text '' * ( no syntax ) : $ aurl/?format = text .    * `` none '' * ( no output ) : $ aurl/?format = none .",
    "the format option is intended for use on the level of the entry returning the whole aflowlib.out . for any given property in the set of keywords contained in the entry ,",
    "the mode is currently to return a simple byte sequence with no formatting . attempting to format a single property returns the full property set in the specified format .",
    "for example , the aurl $ aurl/?density returns the density of the specified structure .",
    "more specifically , for $ aurl = aflowlib.duke.edu : aflowdata / lib2_raw / agti_sv/66/?density it returns `` 6.54346 '' .",
    "however , ... /agti_sv/66/?density&format",
    "= html is equivalent to ... /agti_sv/66/?format",
    "= html , returning the full set of entry properties .",
    "`` html '' is primarily for interactive use where keywords and files can be promptly explored with web browsers ; `` json '' and `` php '' are valid language syntaxes to facilitate the data access by programmed codes ; `` dump '' allows the user to access in his / her own method ; `` text '' returns the entry in a single line with the keywords separated by `` link:|[| ] '' so that other databases can be built on top of aflowlib.org ; and `` none '' may be useful as a method to test the existence of an aurl or for debug purposes .",
    "clear attribution of contributed data is essential for the development of distributed databases comprising inputs from a wide network of contributors .",
    "aflow facilitates attribution with the auid , a unique and persistent identifier , that includes the author , laboratory , group , and affiliation as data entry fields .",
    "the shared content in the database is simple to reduce or augment according to a contributor s preference and the attribution is ensured by the unique identifier and contributor labels that are accessible with the aflowlib - api .",
    "the structure of the aflowlib database is _ federated _ : autonomous members of the consortium ( with distinct geographical locations and affiliations ) are able to transparently contribute to a composite database , preserving ownership and claim over the substance of their data .",
    "the underlying meta - data schema of the contributed data are consistent by production , to ensure the clarity and searchability of the composite database .",
    "a contributor to the consortium begins by downloading the latest version of the aflow binary ( as of writing this paper this is version 30825 ) and interfacing with a quantum code .",
    "aflow is currently configured to run vasp automatically .",
    "pre- and post - processing is functional for both vasp and quantum espresso so that agnostic standardization of inputs and outputs between the two codes can be obtained .",
    "the layered and reentrant structure of the aflowlib api allows the manipulation of data coming from different sources and databases , e.g. the _ materials project _ @xcite . in order to facilitate this future extension ,",
    "special keywords are introduced here to identify the source ( $ aurl/?data_source ) and the translated syntax of the information ( $ aurl/?data_language ) .",
    "we foresee a global common interface where users can approach heterogeneous data and applications to leverage the efforts of different consortia .",
