    "a real equally weighted pure state ( rew ) is a superposition of all basis states with real amplitudes and equal probabilities .",
    "recently , it has been systematically proven that rews have a one - to - one correspondence with the quantum hypergraph states or graph states@xcite @xcite . thus a rew can be described by a mathematical hypergraph ,",
    "namely , a graph where at least one of its edges connecting more than two vertices ; or a ` usual ' graph with two vertex edges . a hypergraph state can be described by a non - local stabilizer , in contrast to a usual graph state which is described by a local stabilizer whose observables are simple tensor products of pauli matrices",
    ". there are a large number of hypergraph states even for a system of a few qubits .",
    "then the local equivalence of hypergraph states is an important problem in applying hypergraph states for quantum information processing . for the local equivalence of arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states ,",
    "the local polynomial invariants have been introduced @xcite and the necessary and sufficient conditions have been proposed @xcite . however , a more practical way is to use the entanglement to characterize the local equivalence of states . in this paper , we will study the local equivalence of all the four qubit hypergraph states and classify the states with their geometric measure of entanglement supplemented with bipartite entanglement entropy , both of them are easily calculable .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath0 is composed of a set @xmath1 of @xmath2 vertices and a set of hyperedges @xmath3 the hyperedge set @xmath4 consists of @xmath5hyperedges ( hyperedge connecting @xmath6 vertices ) for @xmath7 the rank of a hypergraph is the maximum cardinality of its hyperedges . the @xmath5hyperedge neighborhood @xmath8 of the vertex @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 hyperedge . the neighborhood @xmath13 of the vertex @xmath9 is @xmath14",
    ". we also use @xmath13 to denote the corresponding set of neighbor hyperedges . to associate the hypergraph state with the underlying mathematical hypergraph",
    ", we assign each vertex a qubit and initialize each qubit as the state @xmath15 ; each @xmath5hyperedge represents the @xmath5body interaction among the corresponding @xmath6 qubits . the hypergraph state related to the hypergraph",
    "@xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath5qubit control @xmath19 gate such that @xmath20 , and leaves all the other components of the computational basis unchanged .",
    "the rank of a hypergraph state is the rank of it corresponding hypergraph",
    ". we will refer rank @xmath21 or higher hypergraph state as true hypergraph state ( hereafter a hypergraph state refers to a true hypergraph state ) .",
    "hypergraph states can also be put into stabilizer formalism @xcite as graph states can .",
    "the difference is that the stabilizer operators for a graph state are the product of local pauli operators , while the set of stabilizer operators for a hypergraph state consists nonlocal control phase gate operators . given a general hypergraph , for any vertex @xmath9 , the stabilizer operator is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pauli @xmath24 operator ( bit flip ) of vertex @xmath9 .",
    "the hypergraph state @xmath25 is stabilizes by an abelian stabilizer group with generator set @xmath26 @xcite , namely , @xmath27    considering the local equivalence ( denoted as @xmath28 ) of the hypergraph states , we have @xmath29 since @xmath23 is a local operator . using ( [ aee1 ] ) and ( [ aee2 ] ) ,",
    "we have @xmath30 hence applying all the control @xmath19 operation containing in the neighborhood of a vertex to a hypergraph state , we obtain a locally equivalent hypergraph state . in the underlying mathematical hypergraph ,",
    "the transform of hyperedge set produced by @xmath23 is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the symmetric difference , that is , @xmath33 the local equivalence ( [ aee3 ] ) is a very useful tool in classifying the hypergraphs .",
    "as an example , suppose there be a four vertex hypergraph @xmath16 with @xmath34 , the local equivalent hypergraph @xmath35 with @xmath36 can be deduced by applying local operator @xmath37 of the fourth qubit to the hypergraph state .",
    "then @xmath38 hypergraph @xmath35 is shown as @xmath39 in fig .",
    "1 . in fact we can remove all the @xmath40 hyperedges for an @xmath2 vertex hypergraph of rank @xmath2 by applying pauli @xmath23 operators .",
    "we also have @xmath41 for @xmath42 is the pauli @xmath19 operator ( phase flip ) of vertex @xmath43 .",
    "the transform of hyperedge set produced by @xmath42 is @xcite @xmath44 that is , a loop is added to ( removed from ) vertex @xmath9 when there is nt ( is ) a loop .",
    "the unitary operator corresponds to a loop @xmath45 on vertex @xmath9 is @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we can also define hypergraph basis states @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a bit string with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 then all the local @xmath19 equivalent hypergraphs can be written in the form of @xmath51",
    "the entanglement measures for a multipartite quantum pure states are the schmidt measure @xcite , the ( logarithmic ) geometric measure @xcite , the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , the logarithmic robustness @xcite and so on .",
    "the later three measures are equal for graph states@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they are not equal for a ( true ) hypergraph state . geometric measure is the easiest one to be calculated among these three entanglement measures for the multipartite entanglement .",
    "an iterative algorithm was derived for the entanglement of a graph state @xcite .",
    "the algorithm can also be applied to a hypergraph state after a slight modification . thus we will use geometric measure to study the entanglement property of four qubit hypergraph states and classify the states by their entanglement values .    for a four qubit hypergraph state , the iterative algorithm of the geometric measure",
    "is as follows : let the hypergraph state be @xmath52 its closest product state be @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 the overlap amplitude ( inner product ) of the hypergraph state and its closest product state is @xmath56 the lagrange multiplier method of maximizing @xmath57 subject to the conditions @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) gives the iterative equations @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the normalization . by solving the equations we obtain the closest product state @xmath62 .",
    "as far as @xmath63 is determined , it follows the overlap amplitude @xmath64 of a give hypergraph state @xmath65 and the geometric measure of entanglement of @xmath66 is @xmath67    exact expression of the entanglement values for some of the hypergraph states can also be obtained based on the numeric calculation of the closest product states . as an example , let us consider the @xmath68 ( in fig .",
    "2 ) hypergraph state which is the direct product of @xmath69 with @xmath70 the later is the hypergraph state of a three qubit hypergraph with a @xmath71hyperedge and without further two vertex edges .",
    "the closest state of @xmath72 is assumed be @xmath73 due to the symmetry of the three qubits , where @xmath74 with normalization @xmath75 denote @xmath76 then the iterative equation is @xmath77 numeric calculation shows that @xmath78 eventually converges to a real number in a few steps regardless its randomly chosen initial complex value .",
    "thus we arrive at the algebraic equation @xmath79 the solution of which is @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 the geometric measure of the state @xmath83 is @xmath84    the relative entropy of entanglement is @xmath85 for a pure state @xmath83 where @xmath86 belongs to the fully separable state set .",
    "however , the full separability for a generic three qubit system is unknown .",
    "hence the relative entropy of entanglement is not available .",
    "the entanglement is lower bounded by the entanglement of a bipartition of the hypergraph state , this is due to fact that the fully separable state set is the subset of the biseparable state set .",
    "the minimization over a larger set will give a lower value .",
    "the bipartite relative entropy of entanglement @xmath87 is simply the minimal entanglement entropy of all the bipartitions for the pure symmetric state @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the reduced state by tracing the second and the third qubits , where @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath92 the relative entropy of entanglement is larger than the geometric measure for the three qubit hypergraph state .",
    "for the four qubit system , we have rew states @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a four bit string and @xmath95 is a boolean function , i.e. @xmath96 @xmath97 the coefficient @xmath98 can be @xmath99 for each @xmath94 .",
    "the state @xmath100 is uniquely defined by the function @xmath101 via the signs ( either plus or minus ) in front of each component @xmath94 of the computational basis .",
    "it is clear that we have @xmath102 different expressions of the coefficient series . up to the overall phase",
    ", the total number of rew states is @xmath103 there is a one - to - one correspondence between an rew state and a hypergraph state or graph state .",
    "the number of @xmath9 vertex hyperedges is @xmath104 .",
    "the number of four qubit hypergraph states with a four vertex hyperedge ( rank @xmath105 ) is @xmath106 , which is a half of the the total number of rew states .",
    "applying the pauli @xmath42 operator to a hypergraph state gives rise to a one - vertex hyperedge ( namely , the loop ) on the @xmath107 vertex of the underlying hypergraph .",
    "we then remove all the loops of a hypergraph by applying proper pauli @xmath19 operators to obtain the standard hypergraph ( hypergraph free of loops ) . on the other hand , all the three vertex hyperedges within the four vertex hyperedge",
    "can be removed by applying the pauli @xmath23 operators to the hypergraph states .",
    "hence we will consider the standard hypergraphs with two vertex edges and an overall four vertex hyperedge for the four qubit hypergraph states .",
    "the number of these hypergraphs is @xmath108 up to local equivalence of the pauli @xmath23 operators and @xmath42 operators .",
    "permutational symmetry of the vertices leads to further reduction of @xmath108 hypergraphs to @xmath109 hypergraphs as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the geometric measure and bipartite entanglement are listed in table i.    * table i. * the geometric measure of entanglement ( @xmath110 ) and bipartite entanglement of four qubit rank 4 hypergraph states . here",

    "each of the rank @xmath105 hypergraphs in section [ sec1 ] has a characteristic value of geometric entanglement .",
    "hence these @xmath109 hypergraph states are confirmed to be all locally inequivalent due to their different values of geometric entanglement .",
    "the entanglement entropy alone is not a good indication for local inequivalent even considering all possible bipartitions .",
    "we can see that @xmath126 and @xmath127 hypergraph states are not discriminated by the series of bipartite entanglement entropy .",
    "the spectra of bipartite entanglement entropy for @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 and @xmath131 hypergraph states are identical or identical under the permutation of qubits .",
    "the geometric entanglement of @xmath132 hypergraph state coincides with that of @xmath133 however , they are discriminated by their entanglement entropy .",
    "the rank @xmath21 hypergraphs in section [ sec2 ] are all different by their geometric entanglement values except for three cases where further consideration of entanglement entropy is necessary .",
    "the three cases are that the values of geometric entanglement of @xmath134 and @xmath135 hypergraph states are equal ; the values of geometric entanglement of @xmath136 and @xmath137 hypergraph states are equal ; the values of geometric entanglement of @xmath138 @xmath139 and @xmath140 hypergraph states are also equal .",
    "further discriminations are carried out by their bipartition entanglement entropy .",
    "we conclude that there are @xmath141 locally inequivalent four qubit hypergraph states , @xmath109 of them are rank @xmath142 and @xmath143 of the them are rank @xmath144 they can be discriminated by geometric entanglement supplemented with bipartition entanglement entropy .",
    "local pauli equivalence together with permutation symmetry are enough in discriminating inequivalent four qubit hypergraph states ( it may not be true for hypergraph states with more qubits ) . further local clifford equivalence such as local complimentary transform is not necessary ( it is also limited to four qubit hypergraph states ) , although it is a powerful tool in discriminating local inequivalent graph states .",
