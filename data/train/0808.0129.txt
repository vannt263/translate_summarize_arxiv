    "the photometric variability of vw  lmi ( hip  54003 , hd  95660 , sp . type f3 - 5v , @xmath5=8.0 ) , was found by the hipparcos mission @xcite , where it was correctly classified as a w  uma - type eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.477547 days .",
    "the first ground - based photometric observations of the system obtained in 1999 and 2000 ( taken in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 johnson filters ) were published by @xcite .",
    "analysis of these light curves @xcite lead to the photometric mass ratio @xmath8 = 0.395 and inclination @xmath9 = 72.4and contact configuration for the system .",
    "later @xcite presented new @xmath10 photometry and its preliminary analysis . assuming convective envelopes for both components and the temperature of the primary as @xmath11 = 6700 k the authors estimated the mass ratio as @xmath12 , and inclination around 70 .",
    "fourier analysis of its hipparcos light curve ( hereafter lc ) presented by @xcite yielded quite different parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath9 = 72.5  and fill - out factor @xmath14 .",
    "the discovery of the second ( non - eclipsing ) binary in vw  lmi by @xcite makes all previous photometric solutions almost useless due to strong light contribution of the second pair of about @xmath15 ( at the maximum brightness of the contact pair ) which was not taken into account .",
    "@xcite presented long - term spectroscopy ( 209 spectra taken between 1998 and 2005 ) of the system obtained at david dunlap observatory ( hereafter ddo ) which enabled to disentangle all three orbits in this tight multiple system : the contact binary with the @xmath0 = 0.4775 days period is orbiting another binary with @xmath16 days in a relatively tight , 355-days , mutual orbit . using preliminary inclination angle of the contact - binary orbit found by photometric analysis , @xmath17 = 80.1@xmath18",
    ", the authors determined masses of all components and found that the orbits of the binaries are not coplanar . light - time effect ( hereafter lite ) with peak - to - peak range of @xmath19 = 0.0074 days",
    "was predicted to be seen in the minima of the contact pair as a result of the mutual revolution of the binaries .",
    "the lite was found in published minima by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding orbital parameters , @xmath20 = 0.0037(4 ) days , @xmath21 = 353(2 ) days , @xmath22 = 0.5(2 ) and @xmath23 = 2.8(4 ) rad , are rather preliminary due to few available minima .",
    "the eccentricity corresponding to their orbital solution is much higher than predicted spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of vw  lmi was estimated as f5v by @xcite , while observed tycho-2 @xmath24 = 0.21 and 2mass @xmath25 =",
    "0.34 colors correspond to f2v spectral type .",
    "both determined spectral type and colors refer to the whole quadruple system .",
    "vw  lmi is tightest quadruple system known @xcite .",
    "also it has the shortest period of the outer orbit within multiple systems harboring contact binaries .",
    "the ratio of the outer orbital period and orbital period of the non - eclipsing pair is only about @xmath26 = 44.5 hence we can expect secular orbital changes on the timescales as short as decades .",
    "the chances of resolving of components ( binaries ) by either speckle or long - baseline interferometry are rather meager : the maximum angular separation of the components was estimated to be only about 10mas @xcite .",
    "astrometric observations of vw  lmi do not indicate its multiplicity .",
    "goals of the present paper are as follows : ( i ) to present and analyze new photometric and spectroscopic observations , ( ii ) to perform simultaneous solution of lite using both minima times of the contact binary and radial velocities ( hereafter rvs ) of the individual components , ( iii ) to assess possibility of the tidal disturbances of the inner orbits and resulting precession , ( iv ) determine absolute parameters of all four components .",
    "to secure as many minima times as possible , photometry was performed at several observatories in slovakia and germany . since the system was too bright for most of the instruments equipped with ccd cameras , photolenses were extensively used and on larger telescopes , the observations were mostly performed in the johnson @xmath6 filter which enabled reasonable exposure times .",

    "the reasons for negative detection in the hipparcos astrometry are very probably two ( i ) the orbital period is close to one year and orbital wobble mimics parallactic motion and changes apparent annual parallax ( ii ) hipparcos astrometry refers to the photocenter of vw  lmi which substantially decreases the astrometric wobble .",
    "ecliptical latitude of vw  lmi is about @xmath100 = 22.325 .",

    "the solving of the orbit might be complicated by variability induced motion ( vim ) caused by light changes of the eclipsing pair .",

    "<S> tightest known quadruple systems vw  lmi consists of contact eclipsing binary with @xmath0 = 0.477551 days and detached binary with @xmath1 = 7.93063 days revolving in rather tight , 355.0-days orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents new photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding 69 times of minima and 36 disentangled radial velocities for the component stars . </S>",
    "<S> all available radial velocities and minima times are combined to better characterize the orbits and to derive absolute parameters of components . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of the quadruple system was estimated at 4.56 m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the detached , non - eclipsing binary with orbital period @xmath3 = 7.93 days is found to show apsidal motion with @xmath4 years . </S>",
    "<S> precession period in this binary , caused by the gravitational perturbation of the contact binary , is estimated to be about 120 years . the wide mutual orbit and orbit of the non - eclipsing pair </S>",
    "<S> are found to be close to coplanarity , preventing any changes of the inclination angle of the non - eclipsing orbit and excluding occurrence of the second system of eclipses in future . </S>",
    "<S> possibilities of astrometric solution and direct resolving of the wide , mutual orbit are discussed . </S>",
