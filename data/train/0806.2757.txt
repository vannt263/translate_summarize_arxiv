    "the three - body faddeev equations  @xcite in the continuum put three - body scattering on a firm mathematical basis . the complicated asymptotic boundary conditions in configuration space  @xcite are fully included . at the time of their formulation",
    "the computer power , however , was insufficient to solve them directly given local two - body forces .",
    "therefore one started with forces of finite rank ( the simplest being a rank one separable force ) , which turns the three - body problem in a partial wave basis into a finite set of coupled integral equations in one variable - and thus feasible at that time .",
    "nevertheless the way it was formulated in momentum space the free three - body propagator lead to a complicated singularity structure of the integral kernel , namely to logarithmic singularities , whose position depend on the external variable - so called moving singularities  @xcite . in order to avoid this obstacle",
    "the path of integration in the kernel is moved into the complex plane ( contour deformation ) , which imposes of course conditions on the analytical properties of the two - body separable forces .",
    "the need , however , for using the realistic two - body forces , which are dominantly local , enforced their expansion into a series of finite rank forces  @xcite , which was tedious and finally overcome by integrating the logarithmic singularities directly on the real momentum axis  @xcite .",
    "it took until the eighties  @xcite that fully realistic two - body forces could be handled , now in a set of coupled integral equations in two variables .",
    "that approach was based on spline interpolations  @xcite , which allowed to integrate analytically over the interpolated faddeev amplitudes under the integral . in this manner in the three - nucleon system the realistic high precision nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces  @xcite together with three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) of various types  @xcite can be handled in a fully reliable manner  @xcite .",
    "these studies are a basic foundation for testing nuclear forces and triggered a tremendously rich set of neutron - deuteron ( nd ) and proton - deuteron ( pd ) experiments all over the world .",
    "a representative set can be found in  @xcite .",
    "especially the need of 3n forces in conjunction with current two - nucleon ( 2n ) forces was firmly established  @xcite . in recent years",
    "that interplay of 2n and 3n forces has been substantiated by the theoretical insights into nuclear forces gained through effective field theory for @xmath0 s and nucleons ( @xmath1 s ) constrained by chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of controlling the 3n continuum in the faddeev scheme opened the door to evaluate reliably the final state ( initial state ) interaction in photon induced processes on @xmath2 ( pd capture processes )  @xcite .",
    "this provides important insight into the electromagnetic nucleonic current operator , the interplay with 3n forces and into properties of electromagnetic nucleon form factors .    despite",
    "that achieved technical status of controlling the integral faddeev kernel in the three - body continuum it would be desirable to avoid those logarithmic singularities totally . a suggestion in that direction",
    "was undertaken in  @xcite where , however , the presence of the virtual state pole of the 2n t - matrix in the state @xmath3 caused problems .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to establish a definite solution of that long lasting technical challenge with the moving logarithmic singularities by formulating the three - body faddeev kernel in the continuum in such a manner that only trivial poles occur in one variable , which can be handled as easily as in the 2-body lippmann schwinger equation .    in section",
    "ii we give a brief reminder of our standard approach followed by the discussion of all possible alternative choices of variables in the intermediate state integral of the faddeev integral kernel .",
    "one of them sticks out which is free of all technical difficulties and will be displayed in detail . in section iii",
    "we compare numerical results for 3n scattering in the old and new approach using modern high precision nn forces .",
    "the great simplification achieved with the novel approach shows up also in case of finite rank 2-body forces as displayed in section iv .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "we use the notation detailed in  @xcite . the nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) breakup amplitude is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are standard jacobi momenta , @xmath7 the sum of a cyclical and anticyclical permutation of 3 particles and @xmath8 the initial product state of a deuteron and a momentum eigenstate of the projectile nucleon .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 obeys our standard faddeev type equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 2n off - shell t - operator and @xmath12 the free 3n propagator . introducing the momentum space 3n partial wave basis @xmath13 and projecting ( [ t ] ) on these states we get @xmath14    the kernel part @xmath15",
    "can be evaluated using the completeness of the states @xmath16 as @xmath17    here we use the balian - berzin  @xcite approach to calculate the permutation matrix element @xmath18 ( see appendix for details ) @xmath19    moreover the 2-body t - matrix conserves the spectator momentum @xmath20 and all discrete quantum numbers except the orbital angular momentum @xmath21 : @xmath22    finally we extract the deuteron pole in the channels @xmath23 which contain the 2-body @xmath24 states .",
    "thus we define @xmath25 for the deuteron quantum numbers @xmath26 and keep @xmath27 as it is otherwise .",
    "that pole property obviously carries over to the @xmath28-amplitude and we define just for the @xmath23 channels @xmath29    using all that the coupled set ( [ tproj ] ) is for @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and for @xmath33 @xmath34    the shifted @xmath35 and @xmath36 arguments are @xmath37    we are left in eqs .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqb ] ) with four integrations over @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where any two of them can be performed analytically using the two @xmath40-functions .",
    "thus there are six possibilities , which we regard now in turn and we discuss the advantages or disadvantages to use them .",
    "apparently it is sufficient to discuss only the kernel parts and moreover just one , say in ( [ eqa ] ) , which we shall denote just by `` the kernel '' .",
    "the resulting form of `` the kernel '' is @xmath43    this is our standard approach  @xcite . for @xmath44",
    "the integration over @xmath39 leads to logarithmic singularities depending on @xmath45 and @xmath46 - the so called moving singularities .",
    "nevertheless the advantage is , that the complex @xmath47-dependence of @xmath48 can be properly mapped out .",
    "that nontrivial dependence of the @xmath49-amplitude arises from the property of the 2n t - matrix in the state @xmath50 and from the 3n breakup threshold behavior  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron pole at @xmath51 can be taken care of in the @xmath52-integration using e.g. a subtraction method .",
    "we rewrite the @xmath40-functions in ( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqb ] ) as follows @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57    the resulting form of `` the kernel '' is @xmath58 with @xmath59    the two @xmath60-functions define the domain d for the integrations over @xmath61 and @xmath52 which is an open rectangular region in the @xmath62 plane restricted by the straight lines @xmath63 and @xmath64 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "the integrations over @xmath65 and @xmath52 in ( [ kii ] ) split now in the following way @xmath66 for the channels @xmath67 different from @xmath68 only a simple pole in the @xmath69 variable occurs , positioned at @xmath70 and therefore of concern only for @xmath71 . at @xmath72 or @xmath73",
    "there is no pole since the @xmath74 integral vanishes .",
    "for the channels @xmath75 the @xmath47- integral contains the deuteron pole at @xmath76 . if @xmath77 does not coincide with the limits of integration @xmath78 and @xmath79 that integral generates a smooth function of @xmath35 . in case",
    "it coincides , however , logarithmic singularities occur .",
    "their positions are determined by @xmath80 we can avoid them in the following manner .",
    "the product of the free propagator and the deuteron pole term can be written as @xmath81 where we used ( [ eq.17 ] ) .",
    "this provides separation of the free propagator and the deuteron pole singularities .",
    "thus for the @xmath82 channels alone one has the contribution to `` the kernel '' @xmath83\\label{eq.22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first part has only the free propagator singularity in the @xmath65 variable like the part for the channels @xmath84 different from @xmath85 in ( [ eq.18 ] ) and in the second part we change the order of integrations . thus ( [ eq.22 ] ) yields the contribution to `` the kernel '' from @xmath86 channels @xmath87    now in the second part the @xmath65-integration yields a smooth function in @xmath52 and the deuteron singularity in the @xmath52-integral is a simple pole .",
    "altogether `` the kernel '' ( [ eq.18 ] ) is @xmath88    it is the best form out of the six possible ones for the numerical performance .",
    "also the complex q - dependence of the @xmath89-amplitude near @xmath90 in the channels @xmath91 containg the @xmath3 two - body component can be properly mapped out like in case [ sub1 ] .",
    "we choose one @xmath40-function in ( [ eqa ] ) as in ( [ pi1 ] ) and the other one as @xmath93    this leads to `` the kernel '' @xmath94 with @xmath95    the two @xmath60-functions define the domain d for the integrations over @xmath96 and @xmath52 which is an open rectangular region in the @xmath97 plane restricted by straight lines @xmath98 and @xmath99 and which leads to the integrals    @xmath100    one can proceed analogously like in [ sub2 ] and would arrive also at a form free of logarithmic singularities .",
    "the form [ sub2 ] might appear , however , more favorable since each propagator appears only with one integration variable .",
    "we keep the first @xmath40-function in ( [ eqa ] ) as it is and rewrite the second one as @xmath101    the resulting form of `` the kernel '' is @xmath102 with @xmath103    this form appears quite complicated in the pole structure of the free propagator as well as for the deuteron pole and the @xmath104 virtual state pole singularity close to @xmath90 and we do not consider it further .",
    "we rewrite the first @xmath40-function in ( [ eqa ] ) as @xmath105 and keep the second as @xmath106    thus @xmath107 is always greater equal zero .",
    "it is zero for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "`` the kernel '' is @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112    though the free propagator singularity is again a simple pole in @xmath65 a two - fold integration in the @xmath28-amplitude is required .",
    "this appears to be a disadvantage ( though surmountable ) against the case [ sub2 ] .",
    "however , in the deuteron pole both integration variables @xmath113 and @xmath39 occur , which is quite unfavorable .",
    "the first @xmath40-function in ( [ eqa ] ) is taken as in ( [ pi1 ] ) and the second one as @xmath114    it results in `` the kernel '' @xmath115 with @xmath116    though the free propagator singularity is just a simple pole in one variable in the deuteron pole both integration variables @xmath117 and @xmath54 occur , which is less favorable .",
    "we conclude that case [ sub2 ] is clearly the most favorable choice and we compare in the next section results for different 3n observables choosing our standard approach , case [ sub1 ] , and that new one , case [ sub2 ] .",
    "since the complicated singularity pattern in the old approach exists only for @xmath118 we applied the new approach only there and kept the old one for @xmath119 , where only a simple deuteron pole is present .",
    "we used the cd  bonn  @xcite potential restricted to act in the two - nucleon partial wave states with total angular momentum @xmath120 . in fig .",

    "using the choice [ sub2 ] simplifies the treatment of the 3n continuum in case of finite rank 2-body forces also very significantly since there are no longer logarithmic singularities . for the sake of a simple notation we keep only s - waves and restrict the 2-body force to act only in the states @xmath3 and @xmath122",
