    "one plausible explanation is that the stellar content of galaxies is embedded in a dark halo .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ; copi et al .",
    "1995 ) predicts a larger number of baryons than what is seen ( persic & salucci 1992 ) , and so dark baryons hidden in gaseous or compact objects ( carr 1994 , gerhard & silk 1996 ) could explain , at least in part , the dark galactic haloes .    in 1986 , paczyski proposed microlensing techniques for measuring the abundance of compact objects in galactic haloes .",
    "the lmc stars are favourable targets for microlensing events searches . since 1990 and 1992 , the eros ( aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ) and macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 ) groups have studied this line of sight .",
    "the detection of 10 microlensing events has been claimed in the large mass range @xmath3 ( aubourg et al .",
    "1993 , alcock et al .",
    "this detection rate , smaller than expected with a full halo , indicates that the most likely fraction of compact objects in the dark halo is @xmath4 ( alcock et al .",
    "concurrently , the small mass range has been excluded for a wide range of galactic models by the eros and macho groups .",
    "objects in the mass range ( @xmath5 ) could not account for more than 20% of the standard halo mass ( alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the meantime ,",
    "the duo ( alard et al . 1995 ) , macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) and ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1995 ) groups look towards the galactic bulge where star - star events are expected .",
    "the detection rate is higher than expected from galactic models ( see for instance evans 1994 , alcock et al .",
    "1995 , stanek et al .",
    "the events detected in these two directions demonstrate the efficacy of the microlensing techniques based on the monitoring of several millions of stars .",
    "the detection of a larger number of events is one of the big challenges in microlensing searches .",
    "this basically requires the monitoring of a larger number of stars .",
    "the pixel method , initially presented by baillon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , gives a new answer to this problem : monitoring pixel fluxes . on images of galaxies ,",
    "most of the pixel fluxes come from unresolved stars , which contribute to the background flux .",
    "if one of these stars is magnified by microlensing , the pixel flux will vary proportionally .",
    "such a luminosity variation can be detected above a given threshold , provided the magnification is large enough . unlike other approaches ( namely star monitoring and differential image photometry , see below ) , the pixel method _ does not _ perform a photometry of the stars but is designed to achieve a high efficiency for the detection of luminosity variations affecting unresolved stars .",
    "this means that we will work with pixel fluxes and _ not _ with star fluxes .",
    "a theoretical study of the pixel lensing method has been published by gould ( 1996b ) .",
    "this pixel monitoring approach has two types of application .",
    "firstly , it allows us to investigate more distant galaxies and thus to study other lines of sight .",
    "this has led to observations of the m31 galaxy . the agape team ( ansari et al .",
    "1997 ) has shown that this method works on m31 data , and luminosity variations compatible with the expected microlensing events have been detected but the complete analysis is still in progress ( giraud - hraud 1997 ) . a similar approach , though technically different , called differential image photometry is also investigated by the vatt / columbia collaboration ( crotts 1992 , tomaney & crotts 1996 ) .",
    "some prospective work has also been done towards m87 ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "the second possibility is to apply pixel microlensing on existing data , thus extending the sensitivity of previous analyses to unresolved stars .",
    "this is precisely the subject of this paper and of the two which will follow : we present the implementation of the pixel method on ccd images of the lmc .",
    "we have applied for the first time a comprehensive pixel analysis on existing lmc images collected by the eros collaboration . with respect to previous analyses ( queinnec 1994 , aubourg et al .",
    "1995 , renault 1996 ) , our analysis of the same data using pixel monitoring allows us to extend the mass range of interest up to @xmath6 and to increase the sensitivity of microlensing searches . on these images ,",
    "a large fraction of the stars remains unresolved : typically 5 to 10 stars contribute to 95% of the pixel flux in one square arc - second .",
    "since this approach potentially uses all the image content ( and not only the resolved stars ) , the volume of the data to handle is much larger .",
    "hence we perform this first exploratory analysis on a relatively small data set : 0.25 deg@xmath7 covering a period of observation of 120 days , which corresponds to 10% of the lmc ccd data ( 91 - 94 ) .",
    "this paper is the first of a series of three , describing the data treatment ( this paper ) , the microlensing search ( melchior et al .",
    "1998a , hereafter paper ii ) and a catalogue of variable stars ( melchior et al . 1998b , hereafter paper iii ) . in the companion papers ( papers ii and iii )",
    ", we show how the data treatment described here to produce pixel light curves allows us to perform analyses that increase the sensitivity to microlensing events and variable stars with respect to the star monitoring analysis applied on the same field : an order of magnitude in the number of detectable luminosity variations is gained .    to discover real variations , the images and light curves have to be corrected for various sources of fake variabilities , such as geometrical and photometric mismatch , or seeing changes between successive images .",
    "the construction of light curves cleaned from these effects is the subject of this first paper .",
    "if the flux of a given star contributes to the pixel flux , the latter can be expressed as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the flux of the given star , @xmath10 the fraction of the star flux that enters the pixel , hereafter called seeing fraction and @xmath11 corresponds to the flux of all other contributing stars plus the sky background .",
    "if this particular star exhibits a luminosity variation , then we will be able to detect it as a variation of the pixel flux : @xmath12 provided it stands well above the noise .",
    "actually , this pixel flux is affected by the variations of the observational conditions and our goal here is to correct for them .",
    "we discuss the level of noise achieved after these corrections and include this residual noise in error bars .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section : data ] , we start with a short description of the data used . in sect . [ section : align ] , we successively describe the geometric and photometric alignments applied to the images .",
    "we are thus able to build pixel light curves and to discuss their stability after this preliminary operation . in sect .",
    "[ section : meanimage ] , we average the images of each night , thus reducing the fluctuations due to noise considerably . in sect .",
    "[ subsection : stabi ] , we consider the benefits of using super - pixel light curves . in sect . [ section : seecorr ] , we correct for seeing variations and obtain light curves cleaned from most of the changes in the observational conditions . at this stage ,",
    "a level of fluctuations smaller than 2% is typically achieved on the super - pixel fluxes . in order to account for the noise present on the light curves , we estimate , in sect .",
    "[ section : opteb ] , an error for each super - pixel flux .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ section : simu ] that the light curves of super - pixels , resulting from the complete treatment , reach the level of stability close to the expected photon noise .",
    "they are therefore ready to be used to search for microlensing events and variable objects , as presented in the companion papers ii and iii .",
    "the data have been collected at la silla eso in chile with a @xmath13 cm telescope ( @xmath14 ) equipped with a thick ccd camera composed of @xmath15 ccd chips of @xmath16 pixels with scale of @xmath17/pixel ( arnaud et al .",
    ", 1994b , queinnec , 1994 and aubourg et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the gain of the camera was @xmath18adu with a read - out noise of 12 photo - electrons .",
    "for the 1991 - 92 campaign only 11 chips out of 16 were active .",
    "due to technical problems , we only analyse 10 of them .",
    "the monitoring has been performed in two wide colour bands ( arnaud et al . , 1994a ) .",
    "exposure times were set to 8 min in red ( @xmath19 nm ) and 15 min in blue ( @xmath20 nm ) . as the initial goal was to study microlensing events with a short - time scale ( aubourg et al .",
    "1995 ) , up to 20 images per night in both colours are available . a total of 2000 blue and red images were collected during 95 nights spread over a 120 days period ( 18 december 1991 - 11 april 1992 ) .",
    "the combined ccd and filter efficiency curves as shown in grison et al .",
    "( 1995 ) lie below 15% in blue and below 35% in red .",
    "bias subtraction and flat - fielding have been performed on - line by the eros group .",
    "the seeing varies between @xmath21 and @xmath22 arc - second with a mean value of @xmath23 arc - second ( typical dispersion @xmath24 arc - second ) .",
    "it should be emphasised that the observational strategy ( exposure time ) has been optimised for star monitoring . in other words",
    ", this means that the photon noise associated with the mean flux ( typically 280 adu per pixel in red and 100 adu in blue ) is relatively large : 6.6 adu in red and 3.8 adu in blue . to apply the pixel method to this data set , we take advantage of the large number of images available per night , increasing the signal - to - noise ratio with an averaging procedure .",
    "the procedures described below are performed with respect to a reference image .",
    "the correspondence between the flux measured on these images and the magnitude , deduced from grison et al ( 1995 ) , is as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the flux of a star in adu in the blue and red respectively .",
    "note that the zero point is about the same in the two colours , whereas the background flux is much larger in red than in blue .",
    "the correspondence with the johnson - cousins system can be found in grison et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the aim of the whole treatment presented below is to obtain pixel light curves properly corrected for variations of the observational conditions .",
    "the peida package used by the eros group was adapted for pixel monitoring .",
    "this treatment is applied to the first ccd campaign ( 1991 - 92 ) of the eros group on the lmc bar , i.e. 10% of the whole data set analysed in renault ( 1996 ) .",
    "the alignments described in this section are needed in order to build pixel light curves from images that are never taken under the same observing conditions .",
    "firstly , the telescope never points exactly twice in the same direction so that the geometric alignment must ensure that the same area of the lmc contributes to the same pixel flux , through the entire period of observation . secondly , photometric conditions , atmospheric absorption and sky background light change from one frame to another .",
    "the photometric alignment corrects for these global variations .",
    "errors affecting pixel fluxes after these corrections are a key issue as discussed through this section .",
    "it is not obvious how to disentangle the various sources of error introduced at each step , in particular after the geometric alignment .",
    "global errors for each pixel flux , including _ all _ sources of noise , will be evaluated in sect .",
    "[ section : opteb ] .      between exposures ,",
    "images are shifted by as much as 40 pixels and this displacement has to be corrected , in order to ensure that each pixel always covers the same area of the lmc . as emphasised below , errors affect the pixel flux after the geometric alignment and two components can be distinguished . the first one , resulting from the uncertainty in the parameters of displacement , turns out to be negligible , whereas the second one , introduced by the linear interpolation , is a more important source of noise . in this sub - section",
    ", we give a qualitative overview of these sources of errors .",
    "this study , based on synthetic images , allows us to disentangle errors due to the geometrical alignment from other effects present on real images , because the position and content of unaligned synthetic frames are known by construction .",

    "are also taken into account as far as their amplitude remains small ( otherwise the corresponding images are removed from further consideration ) .",
    "a series of mock images synthesised with the parameters of real images ( geometric displacement , absorption , sky background and seeing ) allows us to estimate the mean error on the pixel position to be @xmath29 pixel .",
    "similar estimates have been obtained by the eros group ( ansari , private communication ) on real data .",
    "this introduces a small mismatch between pixel fluxes : in first approximation , the error on the flux is proportional to the pixel area corresponding to the difference between the true and the computed pixel position .",
    "[ [ linear - interpolation . ] ] linear interpolation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    [ pg : phys ] once the parameters of displacement are estimated , pixel fluxes are corrected with a linear interpolation . this interpolation is necessary in order to monitor pixel fluxes , and to build pixel light curves .",
    "we use synthetic images to understand qualitatively the residual errors .",
    "two sets of blue images are simulated with the identical fluxes ( new moon condition ) and seeings ( 2.5  arc - second ) but shifted with respect to one of them ( the `` reference '' image ) .",
    "a linear interpolation is applied to each of these images in order to match the position of the reference . in case of pure translation ,",
    "the corrected flux is computed with the flux of the 4 pixels overlapping the pixel @xmath30 on the reference frame : the areas of these intersections with this pixel @xmath30 are used to weight each pixel flux .",
    "the square of the variable @xmath31 , depending upon @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the displacement in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions , @xmath36 is the sum of the square of these overlapping surfaces .",
    "it characterises the mixing of pixel fluxes produced by this interpolation : the smaller @xmath31 is , the more pixels are mixed by the interpolation .",
    "figure [ fig : trans4 ] displays an estimate of the residual errors affecting pixel fluxes for different displacement parameters , and shows a correlation of the errors with the variable @xmath31 .",
    "the first set of images , simulated without photon noise , shows errors on pixel fluxes due to linear interpolation smaller than 5.5 adu ( about 4.5% of the mean flux ) .",
    "the second set of images , simulated with photon noise , allows us to check that the photon noise adds quadratically with the `` interpolation '' noise and that residual errors are smaller than 7 adu .",
    "the correlation observed on this figure between the error @xmath37 and the variable @xmath31 can be understood as follows : when @xmath31 decreases , the interpolated image gets more and more degraded , and the interpolation noise increases while the poisson noise is smeared out .",
    "this residual error is strongly seeing dependent .",
    "if the above operation is performed on an image with a seeing of @xmath38 arc - second , the residual errors are as large as 10% of the mean flux : the larger the seeing difference , the larger the residual error .",
    "as the seeing of raw images varies between @xmath21 and @xmath22 arc - second , this makes a detailed error tracing very difficult .",
    "the psf is also slightly widened due to the re - sampling , but this effect remains small compared to other sources of psf variability , and is largely averaged out when summing over the images of a night ( see sect .",
    "[ section : meanimage ] ) .",
    "changes in observational conditions ( atmospheric absorption and background flux ) are taken into account with a global correction relative to the reference image .",
    "we assume that a linear correction is sufficient : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the pixel fluxes after and before correction respectively .",
    "the absorption factor @xmath42 is estimated for each image with a peida procedure , based on the comparison of star fluxes between this image and the reference frame ( ansari , 1994 ) .",
    "a sky background excess is supposed to affect pixel fluxes by an additional term @xmath43 which differs from one image to another .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdc ] , we plot the absorption factor ( top ) and the sky background ( bottom ) estimated for each image with respect to the reference image as a function of time .",
    "the absorption can vary by as much as a factor @xmath38 within a single night . during full moon periods",
    ", the background flux can be up to 20 times higher than during moonless nights , increasing the statistical fluctuations by a factor up to 4.5 .",
    "however , this high level of noise concerns very few images ( see fig .  [ fig : fdc ] ) , and only about 20% of the images more than double their statistical fluctuations . despite their large noise , full moon images improve the time sampling , and at the end of the whole treatment , the error bars associated with these points are not significantly larger than those corresponding to new moon periods , except for a few nights .",
    "we note the presence of a variable spatial pattern particularly important during full moon periods .",
    "this residual effect , probably due to reflected light , can be eliminated with a procedure similar to that applied to the agape data , as described by ansari et al .",
    "we calculate a median image with a sliding window of @xmath44 pixels on the difference between each image and the reference image .",
    "it is important to work on the difference in order to eliminate the disturbing contributions of stars , and to get a median that retains only large - scale spatial variations .",
    "we then subtract the corresponding median from each image , to filter out large - scale spatial variations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : clavap ] , we show a light curve before and after this correction . above , the pixel light curve presents important systematic effects during full moon periods , effects which have disappeared below , after correcting for these large - scale variations .",
    "after these alignments , we eliminate images whose parameters lie in extreme ranges .",
    "we keep images which have no obvious defects and parameters in the following range :    * absorption factor : + @xmath45 ; @xmath46 * mean flux ( adu ) : + @xmath47 + @xmath48 * seeing ( arcsec ) : + @xmath49 ; @xmath50    this procedure rejects about 33% of the data .",
    "we are now able to build pixel light curves , made of about 1000 measurements spread over 120 days .",
    "the stability can be expressed in term of the relative dispersion @xmath51 measured for each light curve , where @xmath52 stands for the mean flux and @xmath37 for the dispersion of the light curve .",
    "this dispersion gives us a global estimate of the errors introduced by the alignments , combined with all other sources of noise ( photon noise , read - out noise  ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] , we present the histogram of this dispersion for one @xmath53 patch of one ccd field , which shows a mean dispersion of 9.1% .",
    "we estimate the contribution of the photon noise alone to be as high as 7% .",
    "with such a noise level , dominated at this stage by photon counting and flux interpolation errors , one does not expect a good sensitivity to luminosity variations .",
    "fortunately , various improvements described in the following ( namely the averaging of the images of each night , the super - pixels and the seeing correction ) will further reduce this dispersion by a factor of 5 .",
    "the motivation of this pixel analysis is to increase the sensitivity to long duration events ( @xmath54 days ) in the mass range where all the known candidates have been observed .",
    "it is crucial to note that a sampling rate of 1 measurement per day is sufficient .",
    "the numerous images available each night ( up to 20 per night ) allow us to reduce the noise discussed in sect . [",
    "sec : err ] , by co - adding them , and are very useful for the error estimation as emphasised in sect .",
    "[ section : opteb ] .",
    "we average the images of each night . during the night",
    "@xmath55 , we have , for each pixel @xmath30 , @xmath56 measurements of flux ( @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ) .",
    "the number of measurements @xmath56 available each night is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbima ] and ranges between 1 and 20 with an average of 10 .",
    "the mean flux @xmath59 of pixel @xmath30 over the night is computed removing the fluxes which deviate by more than @xmath60 from the mean , in order to eliminate any large fluctuation due to cosmic rays , as well as ccd defects and border effects .",
    "note that , due to this cut - off , the number of measurements @xmath56 used for a given night can differ from pixel to pixel .",
    "figure [ fig : cl1 ] shows the result of this operation on a typical pixel light curve .",
    "the dispersion in the data on the top panel ( a ) is reduced and included in the error bars ( see in sect .",
    "[ section : opteb ] ) as shown on the bottom panel ( b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cl2 ] shows the same operation applied to a pixel light curve exhibiting a long time scale variation .",
    "one can notice that uncertainties in the data during full moon periods are not systematically larger than those corresponding to new moon periods .",
    "figure [ fig : stabpm ] displays the histogram of relative stability for the resulting light curves , for the same area as for fig . [",
    "fig : stab ] . a mean dispersion of 3.9%",
    "is measured : the noise is thus reduced by more than a factor 2 .",
    "photon noise is estimated to be 3.3% .",
    "thanks to this procedure the psf of the composite images will tend towards a gaussian .",
    "this thus removes the inhomogeneity in the psf shape that can be observed on raw images .",
    "in particular , the seeing on these composite images becomes more homogeneous with an average value of @xmath61 arc - second in red and @xmath23 arc - second in blue and a quite small dispersion of 0.25 arc - second .",
    "the seeing dispersion is divided by a factor 2 with respect to the initial individual images , whereas the average value is similar .    to summarise",
    ", this procedure improves the image quality , reduces the fluctuations that could come from the alignments and removes cosmic rays .",
    "so far we have worked with elementary pixel light curves .",
    "pixels which cover 1.21@xmath621.21  are much smaller than the typical seeing spot and receive on average only 20% of the flux of a star , whose centre lies in the pixel .",
    "a significant improvement on the light curves stability can be further achieved by considering super - pixel light curves .",
    "super - pixels are constructed with a running window of @xmath63 pixels , keeping as many super - pixels as there are pixels , and their flux is the sum of the @xmath64 pixel fluxes .",
    "these super - pixels have to be taken large enough to encompass most of the flux of a centred star , but not too large in order to avoid surrounding contaminants and dilution . as such",
    ", their size should be optimised for this dense star field given the seeing conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : patch ] illustrates the different super - pixel sizes that can be considered .",
    "the expected signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio is proportional to the ratio of the seeing fraction to the super - pixel size ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "going from @xmath66 to @xmath67 super - pixels increases the seeing fraction by more than a factor 3 . then increasing the super - pixel size further increases the seeing fraction substantially less than the fluctuations of the sky background .",
    "figure [ fig : erf ] displays the variation with seeing of the signal to noise ratio for different super - pixel sizes .",
    "it is clear that @xmath67 super - pixels offer the best s / n ratio for our configuration .",
    "as discussed by ansari et al ( 1997 ) , the alternative that consists in taking the average of the neighbouring pixels weighted with the psf is not appropriate here , as it amplifies the fluctuations due to seeing variations .",
    "figure [ fig : stabi1 ] shows the relative dispersion affecting the super - pixel fluxes for ccd  3 : we measure in average 2.1% in blue and 1.6% in red , which corresponds to about twice the estimated level of photon noise ( 1.1% in blue and 0.7% in red ) .",
    "the comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : stabpm ] shows that the dispersion is reduced by a factor smaller than @xmath68 because of the correlation between neighbouring pixels .",
    "this stability can be improved even further by correcting for seeing variations .",
    "despite of the stability discussed above , fluctuations of super - pixel fluxes due to seeing variations are still present . for a star lying in the central pixel ( of the @xmath69 super - pixel ) , on average",
    "70% of the star flux enters on average the super - pixel for a gaussian psf , but this seeing fraction is correlated with the changing seeing . in this sub - section ,",
    "we show that this correlation is linear and can be largely corrected for .",
    "depending on their position with respect to the nearest star , super - pixel fluxes can significantly anti - correlate with the seeing if the super - pixel is in the seeing spot , or correlate if instead it lies in the tail of a star .",
    "a correlation coefficient for each super - pixel @xmath30 can be defined using the usual formula : @xmath70 where @xmath52 and @xmath71 are the mean values of the super - pixel flux @xmath59 and seeing @xmath72 on night @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrsee ] , we show the distributions of correlation coefficients @xmath73 in blue ( left ) and in red ( right ) for each super - pixel @xmath30 .",
    "these histograms look quite different in both colours but both distributions have a peak around @xmath74 .",
    "this peak , which corresponds to the anti - correlation with seeing near the centre of resolved stars , is expected due to the large number of resolved stars .",
    "it is higher in red than in blue , which is consistent with the eros colour - magnitude diagram where most detected stars have @xmath75 ( renault 1996 ) .",
    "the correlation with seeing expected for star tails ( @xmath76 ) is less apparent .",
    "however , a clear excess at high values of @xmath77 ( around @xmath78 ) appears in red , again consistent with the eros colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure [ fig : clsee1 ] gives an example of such a correlation .",
    "the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clsee1 ] displays the scatter diagram of one super - pixel flux versus the seeing , corresponding to a correlation coefficient @xmath79 . despite the intrinsic dispersion of the measurements ( which could be large in particular when a temporal variation occurs ) ,",
    "a linear relationship is observed",
    ". the bottom left panel displays the light curve of this super - pixel .",
    "this seeing correction is aimed at eliminating the effect of the seeing variations and to obtain pixel light curves that can be described as the sum of a constant fraction of a centred star flux and the background ( see eq .  [ eq : phipix ] ) .",
    "the variation of the super - pixel flux can be interpreted as a variation of the flux of this centred stars ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : delphipix ] ) .",
    "however it is clear that the super - pixel flux contains the flux of several stars and that we are not doing stellar photometry , but rather super - pixel photometry .",
    "the idea is to correct for the behaviour described in sect .",
    "[ sect : correl ] using a linear expression : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the estimate of the slope for each super - pixel and @xmath82 is the corrected flux . in the following , @xmath59 will stand for this corrected flux .",
    "figure [ fig : erf2 ] shows that the seeing fraction of a given star varies linearly with seeing , and hence justifies this correction .",
    "if several stars contribute to the super - pixel flux , their contribution will add up linearly , because the flux of the background @xmath11 ( eq . [ eq : phipix ] ) can be written as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 refers to the stars whose fluxes enter the super - pixel , @xmath85 is the seeing fraction of each of these stars , @xmath86 their flux , and @xmath87 the sky background flux that enters the super - pixel .",

    "the improvement on the overall relative stability remains modest , because most light curves _ do not _ show a correlation with the seeing and _ do not _ need a correction .",
    "the importance of the seeing correction as a function of the correlation coefficient @xmath77 can be more precisely quantified .",
    "figure [ fig : parabolla ] displays for both colours the ratio @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the dispersion measured along the super - pixel light curves _",
    "after _ the seeing correction , and @xmath90 the one measured _ before _ the correction , as a function of the initial correlation coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "it can be shown that , if the slope @xmath91 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : see ] is measured with an error @xmath92 , then the following correlation is expected : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the dispersion of the seeing .",
    "this correlation shows that the stronger the correlation with seeing , the more important the seeing correction is .",
    "the dispersion of the measurements can be reduced up to 40% for very correlated light curves .",
    "the limitation of this correction comes from the errors @xmath95 which explain why most points are slightly above this envelope .",
    "when @xmath96 , most points in fact lie above 1 , in which case the `` correction '' worthens things .",
    "therefore we do not apply the correction to light curves with @xmath97 .",
    "as the seeing is randomly distributed in time , the above correction will not induce artificial variations that could be mistaken for a microlensing event or a variable star .",
    "one can wonder however what happens to the super - pixel flux when the flux of the contributing star varies . in this case , the slope @xmath42 of the correlation between the flux and the seeing does change , thus resulting in a lower correlation coefficient . in extreme cases ,",
    "when the correction coefficient is small ( @xmath96 ) , the correction is thus not appropriate and not applied .",
    "[ sect : resi ] the seeing correction is empirical , and can be sensitive to bad seeing determination due to inhomogeneous seeing across the image or a ( slightly ) elongated psf .",
    "part of these problems is certainly due to the atmospheric dispersion , as mentioned by tomaney & crotts ( 1996 ) .",
    "this phenomenon correlates with air mass , and affects stars with different colour differently .",
    "this is a serious problem for pixel monitoring as we do not know the colours of unresolved stars .",
    "figure [ fig : angair ] ( a ) displays the air mass towards the lmc as a function of time for the images studied ( before the averaging procedure ) , and shows , besides a quite large dispersion of air mass during the night , a slow increase with time .",
    "all the measurements have an air mass larger than @xmath98 , and half of them have an air mass larger than @xmath21 , producing non negligible atmospheric prism effects because of the large passband of the filters . according to filippenko ( 1982 ) , photons at the extreme wavelengths of our filters would spread over @xmath99 to @xmath100 arc - seconds in blue depending on the air mass , and over @xmath101 to @xmath102 arc - second in red .",
    "while the psf can be well approximated by a gaussian ( residuals @xmath103 3% ) , a more careful study shows that the psf is elongated with @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the dispersions along the minor and major axis of the ellipse .",
    "however the fact that the psf is elongated does not affect the efficacy of the seeing correction : on the one hand , for the central part of the stars , a similar seeing fraction enters the super - pixel for a given seeing value ; whereas on the other hand , for pixels dominated by the tails of neighbouring stars , the correlation of the flux with seeing will be slightly different , but the principle remains the same .",
    "as the psf function rotates up to 20@xmath107 during the period of observation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angair ] ( b ) ) , this could affect the super - pixels whose content is dominated by the tail of one star and could produce spurious variations correlated with the angle of rotation .",
    "fortunately , this rotation is small and we estimate that even in this unfavourable case it can not produce fluctuations of the super - pixel flux larger than 3% , which can be disturbing when close to bright stars .",
    "we expect this will produce the kind of trends that can be observed in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clsee3 ] and [ fig : clsee5 ] .",
    "_ however this can not mimic any microlensing - like variation .",
    "_    we reach a level of stability close to photon noise , and this stability can be expressed in terms of detectable changes in magnitude : taking into account a typical seeing fraction @xmath108 for a super - pixel , and assuming a total background characterised by a surface magnitude @xmath109 in blue and @xmath110 in red , stellar variability will be detected 5 @xmath37 above the noise if the star magnitude gets brighter than @xmath111 in blue and @xmath112 in red at maximum . with the pixel method ,",
    "our ability to detect a luminosity variation is not hindered by star crowding as we do not require to resolve the star , whereas for star monitoring , the sample of monitored stars is far from complete down to magnitude 20 .",
    "although the dispersion measured along the light curves gives a good estimate of the overall stability , we can refine it further and provide an error bar for each super - pixel flux .",
    "[ section : error ] as explained in previous sections , it is not straightforward to trace the errors affecting pixel fluxes through the various corrections . errors are estimated here in a global way for each pixel flux , `` global '' meaning that we do not separate the various sources of noise .",

    "the dispersion of the flux measurements performed over each night allows the computation of an error associated with the averaged pixel flux .",
    "we discuss how this estimate deviates from gaussian behaviour , and which correction can be applied .",
