    "many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) predict new massive , neutral gauge particles called @xmath3 bosons ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of a @xmath4 resonance has become a matter of high priority to particle physics , because it could reveal many features about any underlying unified theory .",
    "indirect searches for these neutral bosons have been carried out at lep by looking for mixing with the @xmath1 boson @xcite .",
    "experiments into directly producing @xmath4 bosons are being performed at the tevatron @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the potential for discovering @xmath4 particles at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been explored in the @xmath5 tev range @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the search for this particle using the planned international liner collider ( ilc ) has also been explored @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical models which predict a @xmath4 mass in the tev range , where the most popular are the @xmath6 motivated models @xcite , the left - right symetric model ( lrm ) @xcite , the @xmath4 in little higgs scenario @xcite , and the sequential standard model ( ssm ) , which has heavier couplings than those of the sm z boson . searching for @xmath4 in the above models",
    "has been widely studied in the literature @xcite and applied at lep2 , tevatron and lhc ( a recent review on the current status of @xmath7 physics can be found in @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "a string inspired model was recently proposed which predicts a single extra @xmath4 boson with specific couplings to the standard model matter @xcite .",
    "this minimal quiver standard model ( mqsm ) is the simplest quiver gauge theory that both contains the standard model and which could arise as the low - energy effective gauge theory of a perturbative d - brane model in string theory .",
    "stacks of n coincidental d - branes can give rise to gauge groups of the form @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( those with a large @xmath11 limit ) , and strings stretching between these branes carry charges in the bifundamental representations of these groups ( a review of string constructions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "quiver diagrams give a pictorial representation of these setups .",
    "the quiver diagram assigns a graph with marked edges to a given field theory .",
    "the nodes represent gauge groups and the edges represent matter with fundamental or antifundamental representations of the gauge group at each end of the edge ( these are some of the low lying open string states connecting the stacks of branes ) .",
    "an edge with two ends of the same group is a tensor with two indices ( each of which can be fundamental or antifundamental ) under the gauge group .",
    "the effective low energy theory of this effective brane - world scenario is a quiver gauge theory with only bifundamental matter fields . simply enumerating the smallest possible quivers shows that the simplest example of a quiver gauge theory that could come from a d - brane model is the one shown in figure 1 with gauge group @xmath12 , which we will call the mqsm . in the figure , each node represents a gauge group and each arrow a fermion transforming in the bi - fundamental representation of the nodes to which it is attached .",
    "the higgs can also be accommodated as an extra scalar field , shown as a dashed line in the figure .",
    "the labels of the edges indicate the corresponding matter field names in the ordinary standard model ( @xmath13 indicate the quark doublets , @xmath14 indicate the lepton doublets , etc ) .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 groups arise from systems with unoriented strings .",
    "these are also usually called orientifolds .",
    "this enables us to obtain the right hypercharges for both right and left - handed quarks with only 3 total gauge groups , because the string modes for up and down quarks might have different orientations at the non qcd end .",
    "a summary of one generation of the particle spectrum is given in table 1 .",
    "a careful analysis of the anomalies of the theory shows that one of the two overall @xmath17 s is the standard hypercharge , and the orthogonal combination is anomalous . in a pure gauge theory",
    ", this would be a serious problem .",
    "however in the context of an effective d - brane model this mixed anomaly is cancelled by a green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "this requires an extra axionic particle which arises from the closed string gravity sector and which transforms inhomogeneously under the gauge transformations .",
    "this has the side - effect of giving an explicit mass term for the associated gauge boson which is dependent on the specifics of the background geometry of the string theory .",
    "hence the mqsm has one single particle beyond the standard model , a massive neutral gauge boson .",
    "these extra @xmath7 bosons can not be avoided in d - brane models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the anomaly cancellation mechanism requires dimension five operators in the lagrangian , so a direct observation of such a @xmath7 particle would predict a low string scale in order to unitarize the theory at higher energies .    this model has a number of phenomenological advantages which makes it interesting to study .",
    "first , it is extremely simple , with only a single extra particle beyond those in the sm , which enables calculations to be done exactly . second , it has only two unknown parameters , the mass of the @xmath18 and the mixing angle between the two @xmath1 s ( which are related to the green schwarz mass term and string energy scale in the underlying theory ) .",
    "third , unification of the extra @xmath17 factor with the color @xmath19 causes the @xmath7 to be leptophobic , which allows it to remain phenomenologically viable at tev scale masses even after electroweak constraints are taken into account .",
    "we will explain this fact later on .",
    "in this work we report a phenomenological study of the mqsm neutral boson .",
    "first , we consider indirect limits at the @xmath1 resonance obtaining allowed regions for the @xmath20 mixing angle and the @xmath4 mass .",
    "the above analysis is performed through a @xmath21 statistics at @xmath22 c.l .",
    ", including correlation data among the observables .",
    "later , we search for @xmath4 bosons in di - electron events produced in @xmath23 and @xmath24 collisions at fermilab - tevatron and cern - lhc colliders , respectively .",
    "we also search for event signals in the top channel at lhc .",
    "the standard model group @xmath25 can be accommodated in a two - node quiver model that is only a product of two groups . however ,",
    "the matter content can not , as the leptons are doublets under @xmath26 and are not charged under color .",
    "this means that in d - brane models we need to extend the gauge group of the standard model .",
    "the minimal extension requires us to enlarge the gauge group by the smallest amount possible , giving a gauge group @xmath12 , i.e. the model has three stacks of branes .",
    "the other possibility of @xmath27 can not accommodate right handed quarks with different hypercharge .",
    "the insight that the @xmath28 weak group can be described as @xmath26 in string models has been advocated in @xcite , as this reduces the required number of higgs doublets to generate all yukawa couplings at tree level .    using this gauge group",
    "there is only one choice for the left handed quark doublet @xmath13 , a bifundamental @xmath29 .",
    "since we know the right handed quarks have different hypercharge we make @xmath30 transform as @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "as described in @xcite , if we make the right handed quarks appear as two index representations of @xmath19 ( like they do in @xmath34 gut models ) , the yukawa couplings for some of the quarks are forbidden .",
    "our choice also eliminates the cubic non - abelian anomaly for the @xmath35 stack .",
    "the lepton doublet @xmath14 is @xmath36 , which leaves only the right handed electron to fit .",
    "the @xmath37 needs to come from strings stretched between the @xmath17 stack and itself , giving a field in a @xmath38 representation ( for a @xmath8 stack , these are in the symmetric representation ) .",
    "finally , we can have a scalar higgs field with the appropriate quantum numbers coming from strings stretching between the @xmath26 and @xmath17 stacks .",
    "the quiver summarizing the spectrum is in table 1 .",
    "@xmath39    in the end , we have mixed anomalies between the two @xmath17 s and the @xmath40 groups .",
    "it is simple to show that the combination @xmath41 has no mixed anomaly , and as expected , the hypercharge @xmath42 is anomaly free .",
    "however , the @xmath43 ( gauged baryon number ) is not anomaly free , and we expect this anomaly to be canceled by a green - schwarz mechanism , where an extra coupling to a ramond - ramond two - form field or axion to the anomalous @xmath17 will cancel the anomaly and give a mass to the @xmath17 .",
    "this massive @xmath17 gauge boson is the only extra particle beyond the standard model which this model predicts , and its mass is dependent on the specific geometry of the string construction .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the axionic field participating in the anomaly cancellation mechanism is the following @xmath44 here @xmath45 is dimensionless and @xmath46 are coefficients determined by the anomaly , while the vector field @xmath47 is the one that has mixed anomalies . in the above equation @xmath48",
    "has canonical normalization , hence the power of @xmath49 in the mixing term with the axion . under gauge transformation of @xmath50",
    ", we have that @xmath45 transforms as @xmath51 , so the dimension five axionic coupling to the rest of the gauge degrees of freedom is not gauge invariant .",
    "the anomaly cancels when the one loop effective action induced from integrating out the fermions is added to the tree level dimension five axionic coupling term , and the mixing between @xmath45 and @xmath48 is taken into account .",
    "there is an equivalent formulation in terms of an antisymmetric two - index tensor , described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "if one restores units to have @xmath45 canonically normalized , we find that the mass of @xmath48 is @xmath52 and that the dimension five operator related to the anomaly is suppressed by @xmath53 .",
    "when counting loops , this classical term in the action should be counted as a one loop term ( the extra powers of @xmath49 guarantee this ) .",
    "if tree level renormalizable decays are available , the high dimension operators are suppressed by @xmath54 and their contributions to decay rates can be ignored in a first approximation . at that stage",
    "we can also choose the unitary gauge condition @xmath55 .",
    "then we have a standard massive vector field with prescribed couplings to matter .",
    "the effective theory will break down at the scale @xmath56 .",
    "also notice that since we only have one higgs doublet , all of the yukawa couplings are fully constrained by experimental data . in our construction",
    "all coupling constants of the model , except for the mass of the extra vector particle , are fixed by the standard model coupling constants . in this sense ,",
    "our minimal model has only one free parameter and is very predictive .",
    "these need to be matched at the string scale .",
    "renormalization group running changes the low energy values of coupling constants and adds some small dependence on the uv details of the string model .",
    "thus , for the purposes of this paper we will allow three parameters to vary freely to model these effects : the mass of the new gauge boson , the mixing angle between that boson and the original @xmath1 , and the @xmath57 parameter which describes the deviation of the neutral current lagrangian from the standard model . a benchmark model would have the string scale at 10 tev ( the scale at which coupling constants are matched to the string relations ) and the mass of the @xmath7 at 1 tev .",
    "we would then have to account for running of the coupling constants and mixings between 10 tev and 1 tev before comparing to data .",
    "we will often refer to this benchmark point to make estimates .",
    "looking at the quiver and table for the mqsm , we see that the field content is identical to the standard model , with the exception of one extra gauge boson corresponding to the extra @xmath17 in the @xmath35 gauge group . in the following",
    ", we will call the gauge bosons corresponding to the @xmath19 part of the @xmath35 , @xmath58 , where @xmath45 runs from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the gauge boson for the @xmath17 part of @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath62 will likewise be the gauge bosons for @xmath63 , with @xmath45 running from @xmath59 to @xmath64 , and @xmath65 will be the gauge boson for the additional @xmath17 group .",
    "the gauge couplings will be called @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the @xmath68 and @xmath17 gauge groups respectively .",
    "also note that the gauge coupling for the @xmath61 field ( the extra @xmath17 from the @xmath35 ) is actually @xmath69 , because of the difference in the canonical normalization of @xmath19 and @xmath17 . as discussed above in the calculation of the mixed anomalies of this theory ,",
    "there is one combination of the @xmath61 and @xmath65 fields which is anomaly free that we will associate with the hypercharge .",
    "accounting for differences in the canonical normalization of @xmath19 and @xmath17 , we find that the correct combination is      here , we have abbreviated @xmath71",
    ". we will continue to use this and @xmath72 for the various angles we will need in the following calculations .",
    "likewise , there is the orthogonal combination which is anomalous , and has an explicit mass term in the lagrangian from the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism :      notice that this process lets us determine the hypercharge coupling constant .",
    "we find that @xmath74 since experimentally we have that @xmath75 is substantially smaller than @xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the mixing angle @xmath78 is fairly small .",
    "consequently , the field @xmath79 is mostly aligned with @xmath80 and it couples to quarks with strength comparable to @xmath81 , while it couples to leptons with a coupling proportional to hypercharge .",
    "the coupling to leptons scales like @xmath82 , and it is numerically very suppressed .",
    "this means that the branching fraction of @xmath79 decaying into leptons is very small compared to the branching fraction into hadrons .",
    "this is also the way that @xmath79 couples to the higgs .",
    "both @xmath88 and @xmath89 go to @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is chosen so that the @xmath1 s have canonically normalized kinetic terms , as will be show below .",
    "we need to invert the eigenstates , and we find that                      and we have defined @xmath99 .",
    "this is almost identical to the standard model , except with an additional @xmath7 term in the covariant derivative and @xmath100 interaction . to calculate the weak neutral current interaction lagrangian ,",
    "we need to find      using the definitions of @xmath102 and @xmath103 found above , we find that @xmath104 where we ve defined @xmath105 as usual , and we take @xmath106 as the electric charge , with @xmath107 .",
    "note that as the mass of the @xmath7 goes to @xmath108 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 go to @xmath91 .",
    "it s clear that in this limit the first two terms reduce to the normal ones for the standard model .",
    "also note that only the quarks have @xmath109 .                with @xmath115 the usual sm neutral couplings and @xmath116 a new `` quiver '' term given in tab .",
