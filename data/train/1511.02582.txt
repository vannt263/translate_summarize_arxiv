    "in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with u(1 ) symmetry , the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite , driven by topological defects , appears , and it has been studied in many systems , such as superfluid helium films  @xcite , superconducting films  @xcite , two - dimensional melting  @xcite , trapped atomic gases  @xcite , surface roughening  @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular situations , the bkt phase exists as an intermediate temperature phase .",
    "there have been scenarios for the phase transitions of the two endpoints of the intermediate bkt phase : ( i ) jose , kadanoff , kirkpatrick and nelson studied the bkt phase under discrete clockwise ( @xmath1 symmetry breaking ) perturbation by a renormalization group analysis  @xcite .",
    "they showed dual bkt transitions between a low - temperature ordered phase and a high - temperature disordered phase , where the @xmath1 perturbation for @xmath2 on the u(1 ) system becomes irrelevant for a temperature range below the critical temperature of the u(1 ) system .",
    "the critical exponents of the spin correlation function @xmath3 , defined as @xmath4 , were estimated to be 1/4 and @xmath5 at the high and low end points of the intermediate phase , respectively .",
    "following studies have obtained supporting results  @xcite .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 symmetry on phase transitions , especially @xmath6 case , have been studied extensively .",
    "( ii ) in studies of 2d melting , the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young theory  @xcite presented the case of successive two kinds of bkt transitions with respect to the translational and orientational orders .",
    "( iii ) recently , however , bernard and krauth found another scenario with a first - order phase transition at the high - temperature endpoint of the bkt phase ( hexatic phase ) and a bkt transition at the low - temperature endpoint  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the ordering process of the triangular ising antiferromagnet with next - nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interactions ( tiaff ) has been studied in the picture of case ( i )  @xcite .",
    "this model has six - fold degeneracy of the ground state and the six plaquette states @xmath7 ( instead of red and blue molecules , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are allocated in fig .",
    "[ fig_plaquette ] ( a ) ) are mapped to six state clock modes .",
    "an intermediate bkt phase has been observed between ferrimagnetic and disordered phases , while the model without the next nearest neighbor interaction does not exhibit any phase transition at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "recently , as a new aspect of phase transition , we have studied the effect of elastic interactions in the context of the spin - crossover ( sc ) material , in which the high spin ( hs ) and low spin ( ls ) states are expressed by an ising spin .",
    "this material has attracted much attention in their potential applications to photo memory devices , etc . by making use of the nature of photoinduced phase transitions @xcite    taking into account the molecular size difference between hs and ls molecules and the lattice deformation due to the difference",
    ", we have found that the elastic interaction plays an essential role in ordering process  @xcite : the elastic interaction is relevant and its effective long - range nature is important in the ferromagnetic - like ordering  @xcite , where volume fluctuation exists , while it is irrelevant in the antiferromagnetic - like ordering  @xcite , in which two ordered states have the same volume .    here",
    "we study the effect of the elastic interaction on the tiaff model , which is a prototype modeling for triangular sc materials with frustration . in this work we present a new scenario of criticality for the endpoints of the bkt phase : a second - order transition with a new universality class at the low - temperature endpoint and a bkt transition at the high - temperature endpoint .",

    "thus the ground state entropy depends on the configuration of group a or b. in the present work , however , we performed simulations of the elastic model , decreasing the temperature slowly to obtain the ferrimagnetic - like ordered state , and we observed almost equal frequency for configurations of a and b. this indicates that at the finite temperatures , all the six states are nearly degenerate . here the system does not choose the b type ferrimagnetic - like state by the order by disorder mechanism .",
    "the dependence of the frequency for configurations a and b on the cooling procedure will be reported elsewhere . in secs  [ sec_lrnature ] and [ sec_exponents ] , we also find that the infinite - range model ( [ ham_prime ] ) , in which the six states are definitely degenerate , exhibits the same type critical behavior .",
    "thus we concluded that the six states of the elastic model can be regarded to be degenerate at the lower critical point ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "moreover , the coincidence of the critical behavior in both models indicates a new universal criticality , as we show in the following sections .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the tiaff model shows dual bkt transitions , and there exists an intermediate bkt phase ( @xmath97 ) between the ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
