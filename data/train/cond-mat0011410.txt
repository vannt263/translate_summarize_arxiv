    "in these notes we discuss some of the recent advancements in the theory of the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "in particular , we address some of the main steps in the development of a theory@xcite that combines the _ instanton vacuum _",
    "approach for spin polarized , free electrons@xcite with the _ finkelstein _ treatment of the coulomb interactions@xcite in the disorderd systems .",
    "the electron gas with an infinitely ranged interaction potential is , in many ways , very different from what we know about the theory of free electrons .",
    "this class of problems belongs to a different universality class of quantum transport phenomena and it is characterized by a typical interaction symmetry which we name @xmath0 invariance@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 invariance is intimidly related to the electrodynamic @xmath1 gauge invariance and it has major consequences for the renormalization of the theory@xcite .    the main physical objective of our theory is to unify the different aspects of ( abelian ) quantum hall states that have originated from different sources and that have been studied over the years independently .",
    "they include the quantum critical behavior of the quantum hall plateau transitions@xcite , composite fermion theory or the chern simons mapping between integral and fractional quantum hall states@xcite , the luttinger liquid theory of quantum hall edge excitations@xcite , as well as the stability or robustness of the quantization phenomenon due to the disorder @xcite . for a detailed exposure",

    ", the superscripts represent the replica indices ( @xmath3,@xmath4 where @xmath5 at the end of all calculations ) and the subscripts denote the matsubara frequency indices ( @xmath6 where the cut - off @xmath7 is sent to infinity in the end ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath8 generally obey the constraints    @xmath9 and they can be represented by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is unitary and @xmath12 is a diagonal matrix    @xmath13 in order to fascilitate a discussion of the electrodynamic @xmath1 gauge invariance of the theory , we generally follow a very specific cut - off procedure in frequency space and a very specific set of algebraic rules for matrix manipulation which we term @xmath14 algebra@xcite .",
    "for example , if we write the matrix @xmath8 in the form @xmath15 then the @xmath16 matrix is generally taken as a _ small _ matrix in frequency space , i.e. its matrix elements are non zero only for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 . in different words , the unitary rotation @xmath11 mixes amongst ( positive and negative ) frequencies with a _ small _ cut - off ( @xmath19 ) whereas the @xmath1 gauge transformations generally involve _ large _ matrices with a _",
    "large _ cut - off ( @xmath7 ) in frequency space .    by employing distinctly different cut - offs @xmath20 and @xmath7 in matsubara frequency space , both of which are sent to infinity in the end , the problem of electrodynamic gauge invariance simplifies dramatically@xcite .",
    "physically , the cut off procedure is motivated by the vastly different energy scales that generally characterize the elastic scatering processes ( @xmath21 ) on the one hand , and the bandwidth of the electron gas on the other .",
    "however , the rules of @xmath0 algebra can be shown to have a quite universal significance for disordered electron systems .",
    "for example , it successfully descibes the dynamics of chiral edge excitations in quantum hall systems .",
    "it has been used as a microscopic basis for deriving , from first principles , the complete luttinger liquid theory of edge excitations for abelian quantum hall states@xcite .",
    "we generally need the introduction of two more ( _ large _ ) matrices .",
    "first , the diagonal matrix @xmath22    @xmath23 which is the matrix representation of ( imaginary ) time derivative . secondly , there are the off diagonal matrices @xmath24",
    "@xmath25 which are the generators of the @xmath1 gauge transformations . for more details on the rules of @xmath0 algebra and various algebraic identities",

    "the compact notation of the last line indicates that the expression is invariant under @xmath1 gauge transformations ( @xmath0 invariance , see section 4 ) .",
    "this expression generally acts as a single operator under renormalization group transformations@xcite .",
    "the non linear @xmath26 model part and @xmath30 represent , together , the effective action for a system with infinitly ranged electron - electon interactions .",
    "the coulomb potential appears explicitly only in higher dimensional ( irrelevant ) terms ( @xmath33 ) which are usually discarded .",
    "however , these higher dimensional operators turn out to be _ dangerously _ irrelevant and it is generally important to also take the term @xmath33 ( the socalled coulomb term ) into account .",
    "this part of the action can be written as    @xmath34=\\pi t\\int d^{2}xd^{2}x^{\\prime } \\sum_{\\alpha , n}{\\rm tr }   { \\rm i}_{n}^{\\alpha } q({\\bf x } ) u^{-1}({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}^{\\prime } ) { \\rm tr } { \\rm i}_{-n}^{\\alpha } q({\\bf x}^{\\prime } ) , \\label{4}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath35 in this expression @xmath36 represents the thermodynamic density of states and @xmath37 is the bare coulomb interaction in two dimensions .      the theory , as it stands , contains only four quantities for which one needs to compute the quantum corrections , i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath32 and @xmath40 . as is well known , the quantity @xmath39 , multiplying the topological charge @xmath41    @xmath42    is not affected by the perturbative quantum theory and will be dealt with at a later stage .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 , the other hand , remains strictly unrenormalized and this statement , as it has turned out from the microscopic derivation of the action , should be imposed as a general constraint on the quantum theory@xcite ( see also section 7 ) .",
    "this leaves us with two non trivial renormalizations in perturbation theory , i.e. the inverse coupling constant @xmath38 and the interaction amplitude @xmath32 . the complete list of renormalization group @xmath43 and @xmath44 functions in @xmath45 dimension is given by@xcite    @xmath46    here",
    ", we have written @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the linear dimension of the system .",
    "these results are quite similar to those of the classical heisenberg ferromagnet and the physics of the electron gas in @xmath45 dimension can be obtained following the ( in many ways ) unique field theoretic methodology of dealing with goldstone modes .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that the physics of interacting systems is very different from that of free electron localization .",
    "free electron formalisms , unlike the finkelstein formalism , has @xmath8 martrix field variables which usually have two frequencies only , i.e. the advanced and retarded ones@xcite .",
    "a formal but general way of describing the crossover between the single particle and many body formalisms is obtained by varying the frequency cut - off @xmath19 in the @xmath8 matrix fields , from unity to infinity . by varying the value of @xmath19 ,",
    "the theory changes fundamentally .",
    "the most dramatic effect of putting @xmath49 is that the ultraviolet singularity structure of theory ( i.e. the @xmath43 function ) completely changes@xcite .",
    "the presence of the singlet interaction term @xmath30 now implies that the problem generally belongs to a different universality class of quantum transport phenomena .",
    "since there is no fermi liquid principle for the _ disordered _ electron system with an infinite range interaction potential , it is necessary to reconsider the topological concept of a @xmath50 or instanton vacuum which previously was introduced and investigated for the free electron theory alone@xcite .",
    "along with the renormalization behavior , also the structure of the operators of the theory change as the cut off @xmath19 is being sent to infinity@xcite . a new , previously unrecognized notion of _ interaction symmetries",
    "_ now becomes an integral part of the problem .",
    "these symmetries ( @xmath0 invariance , section 4 ) are intimidly related to the electrodynamic @xmath1 gauge invariance and much is yet to be learned about the behavior of the theory in the strong coupling regime .    before elaborating on symmetries and gauge invariance , however , we wish to first address some of the general ideas that are associated with the perturbative renormalization group results of the previous section .",
    "notice that on the basis of the @xmath43 function or asymptotic freedom alone , one generally expects that the interacting electron gas , in two spatial dimensions , behaves _ quasi metallic _ at short distances but it eventually enters a strong coupling phase with a massgap ( an _ insulating _ phase ) , as the lengthscale is increased .",
    "the renormalization of the interaction terms @xmath30 and @xmath33 , i.e. the @xmath44 and @xmath51 functions , generally determine the _ dynamical _ scaling in the problem , i.e. the temperature and frequency dependence of physical obsevables , and this includes the non - fermi liquid behavior of quantities like the specific heat@xcite .",
    "the result of the @xmath44 indicates that the singlet interaction term @xmath30 plays formally the role of an _ order parameter _",
    "( i.e. the spontaneous magnetization ) in the context of conventional critical phenomena phenomenology .",
    "physically it means that the theory generates a ( coulomb ) gap in the density of states that enters in the expression for the specific heat@xcite .",
    "this result is quite different from what one is used to in the theory free electron localization , or in the theory with a finite value of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , such free particle concepts like anomalous or _ multi fractal _ fluctuations in the local density of states are no longer valid in the theory with coulomb interactions .",
    "the physics of the @xmath44 functions is generally very different .    in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted the results for the anomalous dimensions @xmath44 and @xmath51 versus @xmath52 .",
    "we see that in the weak coupling or small @xmath52 regime , the @xmath53 dominates the @xmath54 indicating that the coulomb term @xmath33 is irrelevant .",
    "however , with the @xmath54 function remaining fixed at the value @xmath55 , as mentioned before , there is likely to be a point on the @xmath52 axis beyond which the @xmath54 dominates the @xmath53 function .",
    "this means that upon entering the strong coupling regime , the roles of @xmath30 and @xmath33 get interchanged and the dynamics of the insulating phase is now entirely determined by the coulomb term @xmath33 .",
    "this dangerously irrelevant behavior of @xmath33 has not been recognized previously but obviously plays a fundamental role in the theory of metals and insulators .",
    "this notion can not be obtained in any heuristic or phenomenological fashion , but it clearly affects the way in which we are going to look upon the complications of the theory in dealing with the quantum hall effect .",
    "for example , if the quantum critical singularities of the quantum hall plateau transitions@xcite are appropriately described by the non - perturbative behavior of the @xmath56 and @xmath44 functions of the finkelstein theory@xcite , then this critical behavior is certainly very different from the main expectations of the free particle approximation . unlike the free particle problem which effectively lives in two spatial dimensions alone ,",
    "the finkelstein theory contains the time variable as an extra non - trivial dimension .",
    "this not only destroys any hope of finding an exact ( conformal ) scheme of critical indices , but also invalides any explicit or implicit attempt of employing fermi liquid ideas for quantum hall systems in the presence of the coulomb interactions .",
    "@xmath0 invariance @xcite is one of the most important interaction symmetries of disordered systems .",
    "it means that the action for systems with an infinite range interaction potential ( like the coulomb potential ) is invariant under spatially independent @xmath1 gauge transformations .",
    "such gauge transformations can be represented by a ( _ large _ ) unitary matrix @xmath57    @xmath58 where the @xmath59 are the frequency components of the imaginary time quantity @xmath60 .",
    "the statement of @xmath0 invariance can now be written as    @xmath27=s[w^{-1}qw].\\ ] ] @xmath0 invariance is generally violated by systems with a finite range interaction potential , or free electron systems .",
    "one can show that these systems map , under the action of the renormalization group , back onto the free electron theory and , therefore , fermi liquid ideas can be applied in this case .",
    "the concept of @xmath0 invariance implies that only the quantities and correlations that are @xmath0 invariant have a simple infrared behavior that generally can be handled with the methodology of the renormalization group .",
    "it also implies that the _ dynamical scaling _ of physical observables like the conductances can only be extracted from the theory if @xmath0 invariance is respected by the renormalization scheme that one chooses .",
    "for example , the momentum shell or background field methodology generally violate @xmath0 invariance and this complicates the computation of e.g. the ac conductances",
    ".    on the other hand , the partition function itself , or the response to electromagetic fields , generally respects statement of @xmath0 invariance .",
    "it is therefore important to study @xmath0 invariant quantities in general and see @xmath0 algebra at work .",
    "if , for the sake of simplicity , we first consider the theory for weak static magnetic fields , then the various pieces of the action , in the presence of scalar and vector potentials , can be written in a transparant fashion as follows@xcite    @xmath61&=&\\frac{\\sigma _ { xx}^{(0)}}{8}{\\rm tr}\\left [ d_{\\mu } , q\\right ] ^{2 } -\\frac { \\sigma _ { xy}^{(0)}}{8}\\varepsilon _ { \\mu \\nu } { \\rm tr } q\\left [ d_{\\mu } , q\\right ] \\left [ d_{\\nu } , q\\right ]   , \\\\",

    "as a simple check of the above formulae , we compute the gauge invariant electromagnetic response at a tree level , for the case @xmath69 . we obtain    @xmath70= \\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{\\alpha , n}\\int \\frac{% d^{2}p}{(2\\pi ) ^{2}}\\frac{\\sigma _ { xx}^{(0)}}{8}\\left [ \\delta _ { \\mu \\nu } -% \\frac{p_{\\mu } p_{\\nu } } { p^{2}+4\\omega _ { n}u^{-1}(p)/\\sigma _ { xx}^{(0)}}% \\right ] \\frac{(e_{\\mu } ) _ { n}^{\\alpha } \\overline{(e_{\\nu } ) _ { n}^{\\alpha } } } { % \\omega _ { n}}.   \\label{7}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the electric field .",

    "the tree level response therefore reproduces the well known results of the theory of metals .",
    "we have computed the complete response to extenal electromagnetic fields with quantum corrections and checked the gauge invariance at a one loop level .",
    "the analysis is rather lengthy and the details will be reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we present , instead , the final result for the continuity equation which can be written in frequency and momentum notation as follows    @xmath79    here , @xmath80 is the _",
    "renormalized _ longitudinal conductivity which is expressed as @xmath81 plus quantum corrections . furthermore ,",
    "@xmath82 the renormalized diffusive coefficient and @xmath83 .",
    "it is important to remark that the static ( @xmath84 ) limit of this expression has an important general significance for the renormalization of the theory .",
    "notice that by putting @xmath85 , the expression only contains the thermodynamic quantities such as @xmath86 , the thermodynamic density of states , @xmath87 , which is the derivative of the electron density with respect to the static external @xmath67 , as well as the bare coulomb interaction @xmath88 .",
    "this form of the static response can be shown to be quite generally valid , independently of the effective action of the @xmath8 field variables .",
    "this means that the thermodynamic quantities @xmath86 , @xmath89 as well as @xmath88 generally do not acquire any quantum corrections and this statement can be imposed as an important general constraint on the quantum theory .",
    "notice that this constraint does not involve the quantities @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the interaction amplitude @xmath92 which do not appear in the expression for static response .",
    "these quantities are therefore the only ones for which quantum corrections are possible ( and do occur ) in general .",
    "the results of the previous section imply that a general quantum theory of physical observables can be formulated and expressed in terms of @xmath0 invariant correlations of the @xmath8 field variables . for example , the linear response to an external electric field can be generally expressed in terms of a quantity @xmath93 ( kubo formula ) as follows    @xmath94 \\left [ { \\rm i}% _ { -\\eta } ^{\\alpha } , q\\right ] \\right\\ } \\right\\rangle + \\frac{\\sigma _ { xx}^{(0)2}}{16\\eta d}\\int_{x^{\\prime } } \\left\\langle { \\rm tr}\\left\\ { \\left [   { \\rm i}_{\\eta } ^{\\alpha } , q\\right ] \\partial _ { \\mu } q\\right\\ } { \\rm tr}\\left\\ { \\left [ { \\rm i}_{-\\eta } ^{\\alpha } , q\\right ] \\partial _ { \\mu } q\\right\\ } \\right\\rangle \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this result , when evaluated perturbatively @xcite , is of the general form @xmath95 .",

    "we mention that the list of effective parameters @xmath93 and @xmath96 can also be extended to include an effective quantity @xmath97 which is associated with the interaction amplitude @xmath32 .",

    "the non - perturbative contributions from a topologically nontrivial sectors of the theory ( instantons ) have formally the same structure as those obtained in the theory of free electrons @xcite . since the analysis is rather involved @xcite , we simply present the most important results as illustrated by the renormalization group flow lines in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 conductance plane in fig .",
    "2 .    the general consequences of the coulomb interactions for the quantum critical behavior of the plateau transitions will be reported elsewhere . on the other hand ,",
    "there is the problem of _ robust _ quantization of the hall conductance which is represented in fig . 2 by the strong coupling fixed points at integer values of @xmath91 . this aspect of the theory can obviously not be obtained from any analysis in the weak coupling regime , either perturbative or non - perturbative , and it generally requires a more explicit knowledge of physics of incompressible the quantum hall states .",

    "it is important to remark that by extending the instanton vacuum approach to include the effective action for edge excitations in the quantum hall state @xcite , the significance of @xmath0 invariance has now also been demonstrated in the otherwise forbidden strong coupling regime of the finkelstein theory .",
