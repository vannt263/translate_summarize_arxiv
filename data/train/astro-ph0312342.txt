    "a significant fraction of type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show ` soft x - ray excess emission ' above a power - law continuum , usually identified as the steepening of the x - ray continuum below @xmath11 .",
    "this soft excess emission was first observed by _ heao-1 _ ( pravdo et al .",
    "1981 ) , and _ exosat _ ( arnaud et al . 1985 ; singh et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the number of agn with soft x - ray excess emission or ` ultra soft agn ' increased dramatically with the launch of _",
    "rosat_. boller , brandt , & fink ( 1996 ) showed that agn with steepest soft x - ray spectra in the _ rosat _ band tend to lie at the lower end of the h@xmath12 line width distribution .",
    "these agn with fwhm@xmath13 are classified as the narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) galaxies ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , and are distinguished from the bulk of the seyfert  1 galaxies ( ` broad - line seyfert  1s ' or bls1s ) .",
    "nls1s also have strong optical fe   emission .",
    "detailed x - ray study of nls1s was carried out with _ asca _ which confirmed the soft x - ray emission and , in addition , showed that the @xmath14 continuum slope too is steeper and anti - correlated with the fwhm of the h@xmath12 line ( brandt , mathur , & elvis 1997 ; leighly 1999b ; vaughan et al.1999b ) .",
    "_ asca _ observations also showed that many nls1s have fe  k@xmath6 line arising from highly ionized iron , and hence the accretion disks of nls1s must be ionized ( dewangan 2002 , and references therein ; see ballantyne , iwasawa , & fabian 2001 for ionized reflection model for nls1s ) .    during the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ era",
    ", nls1s drew attention of most workers due to the extreme variability of their strong soft x - ray emission .",
    "nls1s are the most extreme x - ray variable objects among the radio - quiet agn .",
    "nls1s frequently exhibit rapid ( doubling time scales of a few hundred seconds ) and/or large ( up to a factor of 100 ) amplitude x - ray variability ( e.g. , boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ; dewangan et al .",
    "2001,2002 ) .",
    "the excess variance for nls1s is typically an order of magnitude higher than that observed for bls1s .",
    "( leighly 1999a ; turner et al 1999 ) .",
    "the strong soft x - ray emission of nls1s is usually attributed to the intrinsic emission from viscous accretion disks ( pounds et al .",
    "however , the variability of the soft x - ray emission has been found to be faster than the characteristic time scales for an accretion disk ( boller et al .",
    "the fastest time scales for an accretion disk are the thermal time scale , @xmath15 , on which thermal instabilities grow , and the sonic time scale , @xmath16 , on which the sound waves cross the disk . in the above",
    ", @xmath6 is the viscosity parameter ( shakura & synyaev 1973 ) , @xmath17 is the angular velocity and @xmath18 is the height scale of the disk .",
    "these time scales are about a factor of two larger than the observed variability time scale for the nls1 galaxy iras  13224 - 3809 ( boller et al .",
    "the same is true for many nls1 galaxies .",
    "this apparently argues against the accretion disk origin for the strong soft x - ray emission and the nature of the soft x - ray excess emission remains uncertain .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ grating spectroscopy of nls1s have revealed that the soft x - ray excess emission is a smooth continuum component rather than a blend of emission / absorption features ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ; collinge et al 2001 ; gondoin et al .",
    "2002 ; page et al .",
    "it is not clear whether the rapid variability of the smooth soft x - ray emission is due to the variability of the soft excess emission above and over the power - law or it is the underlying power - law component which is varying rapidly .",
    "based on a 10  day _ asca _ observation of iras  13224 - 3809 , dewangan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that the rapid variability in the soft x - ray band is likely to be due to the rapid variability of the power - law emission and there may not be intrinsically rapid variability in the soft excess emission above the power - law .",
    "this observation , if confirmed further , will have profound effects on constraining models for x - ray emission of nls1s .",
    "however , this requires time resolved x - ray spectroscopy with short time scales which was not possible with the earlier x - ray observatories .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ having the largest collecting area and broad bandpass is the most suitable for the above purpose .    in this paper",
    ", we present results based on an _ xmm - newton _ observation of i  zw  1 , including time resolved spectroscopy on time scales of @xmath19 , comparable to the dynamical time scale for a keplerian accretion disk @xmath20 .",
    "i  zw  1 is the prototype nls1 galaxy .",
    "its optical spectrum shows exceptionally narrow balmer emission lines ( fwhm@xmath21 ; boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "i  zw  1 is well known for its strongest optical and uv fe   emission ( boroson & green 1992 ; laor et al .",
    "its high absolute luminosity ( m@xmath22 for h@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) makes it the nearest quasar ( @xmath25 ) and is also called as the ` narrow - line quasar '  a high luminosity version of the nls1 galaxies .",
    "i  zw  1 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) on 22 june 2002 using the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , and the optical monitor ( om ) instruments .",
    "the epic mos @xcite , and pn @xcite cameras were operated in small , and large window modes , respectively , to alleviate pileup of photons from the source .",
    "the epic cameras used the medium optical blocking filter .",
    "the raw events were processed and filtered using the most recent updated calibration database and analysis software ( sas v5.4.1 ) available in october 2003 .",
    "events in the bad pixels and those adjacent pixels were discarded .",
    "only events with pattern @xmath26 ( single and double ) for the pn and @xmath27 for the mos were selected .",
    "examination of pn light curve extracted from the full field but above @xmath28 showed flaring particle background in two observation intervals of about @xmath29 .",
    "these intervals were excluded from the rest of the analysis .",
    "this resulted in ` good ' exposure time of @xmath30 for the pn and @xmath31 for the mos cameras .",
    "source photons were extracted from the pn and mos data using a circular region of radius @xmath32 centered at the source position .",
    "associated background photons were extracted from source free regions near the source .",
    "the total number of net source photons is @xmath33 detected with the pn and @xmath34 detected with each of the mos cameras .",
    "x - ray light curves of i  zw  1 were extracted from the pn and mos data using a circular region of @xmath32 centered at the source position and in the soft ( @xmath35 ) , hard ( @xmath14 ) , and full ( @xmath36 ) bands .",
    "the soft and hard bands were chosen to separate approximately the two spectral components  a power - law and a soft excess component generally observed from nls1 galaxies ( see e.g. , leighly 1999b ) .",
    "the time bins with sizes of @xmath37 are at least @xmath38 exposed in all the light curves .",
    "background light curves were extracted from source free regions with the same bin sizes , exposure requirements , and in the same energy bands as for the source light curves .",
    "the background light curves were subtracted from the respective source light curves after appropriate scaling to compensate for the different areas of the extraction regions .",
    "the three light curves extracted from the pn and mos data , were combined to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "is the hardness ratio defined as the ratio of count rates in the @xmath14 and @xmath35 bands .",
    "it is evident that x - ray emission from i  zw  1 varied strongly during the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the light curves show trough - to - peak variations by a factor of @xmath41 in the full band , @xmath42 in the soft band , and @xmath43 in the hard band .",
    "the most remarkable variable event is a large x - ray flare which started at @xmath44 after the beginning of the observation and lasted for about @xmath45 . during this flare",
    "the full band count rate increased from @xmath46 to @xmath47 in just @xmath48 .",
    "the count rates quoted above were calculated as the mean of at least three data points .",
    "the soft and hard band light curves show similar variability pattern and appear to be correlated . to quantify this correlation and to search for any possible time lag , we have calculated cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the hard band light curve with respect to the soft band light curve . for this purpose we utilized pn and mos light curves with time bins of @xmath49 created in a similar way as described above .",
    "the ccf was calculated using the ftools program crosscor .",
    "the ccf is plotted in figure  [ f3 ] with time bins of @xmath50 , which shows strong correlation between the soft and hard band light curves without any significant delay .",
    "we also examined ccfs with smaller time bins and found no time lag between the two light curves .    despite the strong correlation between the soft and hard band light curves",
    ", the x - ray flare has different amplitude of variability in the soft and hard bands .",
    "the flare is more intense in the hard band ( an increase in count rate by a factor of @xmath51 ) than in the soft band where the count rate increased by a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "this is reflected in an increased hardness ratio during the flare ( see fig .",
    "it appears that the hardness ratio generally follows the variations in the count rate in any band .",
    "this is obvious in figure  [ f2 ] where the hardness ratio is plotted against the count rate in the full band .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows that the x - ray emission from i  zw  1 hardens with x - ray intensity .",
    "the trend in the hardness ratio with count rate tells us that the total counts in the @xmath14 band increases more than that in the @xmath35 and nothing about the @xmath14 or @xmath35 spectral change .",
    "photon energy spectra of i  zw  1 and associated background spectra were accumulated from the epic pn and mos data using the same source and background extraction region described above .",
    "the pulse invariant channels were grouped such that each spectral bin contained at least 80 and 30 counts in the case of pn and mos spectra , respectively .",
    "the epic responses were generated using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "the first order rgs1 and rgs2 spectra of i  zw  1 were extracted using source regions in dispersion / spatial coordinates that contained @xmath53 of the point source events .",
    "the corresponding background spectra were generated using the entire regions of ccd arrays but excluding @xmath54 of the point spread function along the spatial direction .",
    "rgs response matrices were calculated using the sas task rgsrmfgen .",
    "both the rgs spectra were binned to 5 channels , a further grouping ( a minimum of 5 counts per spectral channel ) was applied to avoid zero counts in any channel .",
    "all the spectral fits were performed with the xspec package ( version 11.2 ; arnaud 1996 ) and using the @xmath55-statistic for the epic spectra and c - statistic for the rgs spectra .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the quoted errors on the best - fit model parameters were calculated for the @xmath53 confidence level for one interesting parameter i.e. , @xmath56 or @xmath57 .      at first the mos and pn spectra",
    "were fitted separately to check for the possible uncertainties due to cross - calibration problems .",
    "we found generally good agreement between mos2 and pn cameras ( @xmath58 ) in the @xmath59 bands , however , mos1 results in a flatter ( @xmath60 ) spectrum .",
    "these discrepancies are consistent with that found by molendi & sembay ( 2003 ) . in the @xmath61 band , mos1 spectrum is flatter ( @xmath62 ) than pn spectrum , while mos2 data agrees well with the pn data ( @xmath63 ) . therefore we present the spectral results obtained by fitting the same model jointly to the pn and mos2 data while allowing the relative normalizations to vary . however , pn and mos data do not agree below @xmath64 .",
    "similar discrepancies at low energies have been found for pg  1211 + 143 ( pounds et al .",

    "therefore , we fixed the column density to the galactic value and added an additional photoelectric absorption model at the source redshift to our two component model .",

    "the best - fit model and the unfolded spectrum are shown in figure  [ f6 ] .",
    "due to the contribution of the ionized reflection in the soft x - ray band , the strength of the blackbody component is weaker in model 2 compared to that derived in model 1 .",
    "inverse compton scattering of soft photons by hot electrons , possibly located in a corona above the disk , can produce approximate power - law continuum .",
    "the primary continuum emission of agn is a comptonized spectrum not an exact power law .",

    "the soft x - ray excess component is modeled by ionized reflection and a weak blackbody component . since the thermal comptonized spectrum is an approximate power - law , we further investigate the significance of the weak blackbody component after replacing the power - law component in model 2 by a comptonization model .",
    "we used the thermal comptonization model comptt ( titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the temperature of the seed photons ( @xmath122 ) , assumed to follow a wien law , the optical depth of the scattering region ( @xmath123 ) , the electron plasma temperature ( @xmath124 ) , and a parameter defining the geometry ( a disk or a sphere ) . in the following , we consider the disk geometry .",

    "a corona with two electron populations with distinct temperatures can give rise to both a soft x - ray excess and a power - law .",
    "it is likely that the surface of an accretion disk is ionized , the outermost layers may contain thermal electrons in addition to the hotter electron population above the disk in the corona . under such conditions",
    ", the cool disk photons will be first comptonized by the cooler of the electron population at the surface of the disk , giving rise to the soft excess emission below @xmath11 .",

    "we investigated if such a process is a viable model for the x - ray spectrum of i  zw  1 .",
    "first , we tried to fit the power - law component with the comptt model . a combination of a blackbody , comptt , a gaussian line , and an edge model provided a good fit ( @xmath131 for 779 dof ) .",

    "strong variation is present only for the flux . to quantify these variations we performed spectral fitting of the time selected spectra .",
    "we used the model 1 ( a combination of a blackbody + power law + gaussian line multiplied by galactic , intrinsic absorption and an iron k - edge models ) and fitted the 4 time - selected epic spectra .",
    "it was not possible to constrain both the gaussian line and iron k - edge for individual spectra .",
    "therefore , we fixed the line energy and width of the gaussian line and the parameters of the edge model to be the same as the best - fit values derived for the mean spectrum .",

    "we fixed the parameters of the iron line and edge to be the same as that derived for the mean spectrum . in order to investigate which model parameter or parameters differ most significantly between the two flux states , we tied all the model parameters for the high flux state to that of low flux state and untie the parameters step - by - step .    the best - fit model with the same model parameters for the two flux states is not a good fit ( @xmath163 for @xmath164 dof ) .",
    "varying the power - law normalizations independently resulted in an acceptable fit ( @xmath165 for 1280 dof ) . untying the photon indices further improved the fit ( @xmath166 for @xmath167 dof ) , with significantly different best - fit photon indices of @xmath168 ( high flux state ) and @xmath169 ( low flux state ) .",
    "we also varied the blackbody normalization independently , the fit did not improve further ( @xmath170 for @xmath171 dof ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the blackbody normalization did not vary between the two flux states and tied the parameter again in the following analysis .",

    "i  zw  1 was fainter by a factor of @xmath206 during the _ asca _ observation .",
    "true to the nature of nls1 galaxies , i  zw  1 showed rapid and large amplitude x - ray variability during the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "x - ray emission from i  zw  1 increased by @xmath207 in @xmath48 only , corresponding to a change in the @xmath10 luminosity of @xmath208 .",
    "this is a remarkable variability for a radio - quiet quasar as the time scale is a factor of @xmath209 shorter than the dynamical time scale for a @xmath210 schwarzschild black hole .",
    "such variability is rare among radio - quiet quasars .",
    "other radio - quiet quasars to show such rapid and large amplitude variability are phl 1092 ( brandt et al .",
    "1999 ) , rx j1334.9 + 3759 ( dewangan et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the major consequence of rapid and large amplitude variability is that the source has to be emit very efficiently .",
    "it is possible to calculate the efficiency of conversion of rest mass into energy using simple arguments originally due to fabian ( 1979 ) .",
    "if the x - ray emitting region is an accreting spherical cloud of ionized hydrogen , then there is a limit on the radiative efficiency , @xmath211 , given by @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the change in luminosity in the rest - frame time interval @xmath214 .",
    "first , we convert the change in the combined pn@xmath215mos count rate into change in the luminosity by using a constant conversion factor of @xmath216 , derived from the time averaged pn@xmath215mos count rate and the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the change in the count rate of @xmath217 over @xmath218 ( @xmath219 in the rest frame ) corresponds to a rate of change of luminosity , @xmath220 .",
    "this gives a lower limit to the efficiency , @xmath221 .",
    "this efficiency can be compared with the maximum efficiency possible for a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath222 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) and a kerr black hole ( @xmath223 ; thorne 1974 ) .",
    "thus the rapid flare observed from i  zw  1 is consistent with that expected for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "our time resolved spectroscopy has revealed that the soft x - ray excess emission , presumably arising from an accretion disk , did not vary appreciably during the giant flare seen in fig .",
    "the rapid and large amplitude variability is consistent with a flaring of the power - law component alone .",
    "the primary power - law emission of radio - quiet agn is thought to be the result of comptonization of soft photons from the disk by hot , relativistic electrons in a region , the geometry of which is not clear at present .",
    "the possibilities are  ( @xmath72 ) an extended corona above a cold accretion disk ( e.g , haardt & maraschi 1991 ) , ( @xmath224 ) non - thermal electrons at the base of a jet , and ( @xmath225 ) thermal electrons in the innermost regions of an accretion disk . in the first case",
    ", rapid and large amplitude variability can be produced by magnetic flares arising from the surface of the disk . in the second case , ejection of a relativistic plasma blob as a jet would produce the giant flare with power - law spectral shape . in the third scenario , it is difficult to produce giant and rapid flares .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the first two possibilities in the absence of wide band x - ray spectrum up to several hundred kev .",
    "however , a kerr black hole is not required in any of the two possible scenarios .",
    "magnetic flares can be produced on very short time scales as the reconnection time scale can be very short ( merloni & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "there is a clear evidence for a change in the hardness ratio with total count rate ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the full band x - ray spectrum of i  zw  1 hardens with increasing flux .",
    "a detailed time - selected spectral analysis revealed that hardening of the full band spectrum as suggested by the hardness ratio is due to the increase in the power - law normalization and a steady soft excess component .",
    "our flux - selected spectroscopy has revealed that the power - law component became stronger and slightly flatter in the flaring or high flux state .",
    "thus the change in the hardness ratio is not only due to the variations in the @xmath14 band flux but also due to hardening of the primary power - law .",
    "the spectral hardening of i  zw  1 with increasing flux is in sharp contrast with that observed from many seyfert galaxies , which generally show spectral steepening with increasing flux ( turner 1987 ; singh et al . 1991 ; turner et al .",

    "georgantopoulos & papadakis ( 2001 ) found similar behavior in a number of seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "to explain such spectral variability , mchardy et al.(1998 ) and shih et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed a two component model , consisting of a soft component with constant spectral shape but variable flux and a hard component with constant flux , so that the soft component dominates the spectrum at high fluxes and overall spectrum becomes steeper . using a long _ xmm - newton _ observation , fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) showed that the spectral variability of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , on time scales of @xmath226 , is characterized by a soft varying component which is a power - law with constant slope and a hard constant component produced by very strong reflection from a relativistic disk .",
    "in contrast , in the case of i  zw  1 , it is the soft component with constant flux and the hard component with variable flux resulting in spectral hardening .",
    "the observed @xmath14 spectral steepening with flux has been attributed to the change in the shape of the comptonized spectrum possible due to compton cooling by increased seed or soft photon flux from the disk ( haardt , maraschi , & ghisellini 1997 ) or due to increasing covering fraction of the corona resulting from correlated magnetic flare or reconnection events ( thunder - cloud model of merloni & fabian 2001 ) . obviously both the scenarios are not applicable to the spectral behavior of i  zw  1 .",
    "the soft excess emission did not increase with flux during the flare , implying that there was no change in either the seed photons from the disk or reprocessed emission by the disk .",
    "the soft excess emission attributed to the intrinsic disk emission and reprocessed emission simply did not appear to respond the large x - ray flare .",
    "this is possible if the flare emission was beamed away from the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray flare and accompanied spectral hardening of i  zw  1 is suggestive of a generation of a new population of hot or relativistic electrons without an increase in the covering fraction of the corona",
    ". this new population must be short - lived and beamed away from the disk .",
    "this is possible if the new population is ejected from the base of a jet and may be part of a discrete jet . the x - ray flaring",
    "then could be due to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process as in the case of radio - loud agn .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarities of the differences between the x - ray spectra of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn and that of i  zw  1 in the low flux and high flux states .",
    "the high resolution soft x - ray spectrum of i  zw  1 , obtained with the rgs , is featureless and smooth .",
    "we did not detect any emission or absorption features below @xmath227 , the region of the spectrum usually affected by the warm absorbers .",
    "the rgs spectrum of i  zw  1 supports the earlier observations with _",
    "letg and _ xmm - newton _ rgs that the soft x - ray excess emission of nls1 galaxies is featureless and smooth ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ; collinge et al 2001 ; gondoin et al . 2002 ; page et al .",
    "although the soft x - ray excess emission above a power - law continuum is well described by a blackbody component , its temperature is too high for the intrinsic emission from an accretion disk .",
    "the temperature of a standard thin accretion disk is @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath230 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath231 ( peterson 1997 ) .",
    "the temperature at the last stable orbit ( @xmath232 ) for a schwarzschild black hole is @xmath233 for a black hole mass of @xmath234 accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "this is an upper limit to the disk temperature , because @xmath235 , and outer regions of the disk will have lower temperatures .",
    "a more realistic model involving ionized reflection in addition to the blackbody and power - law components describes the @xmath0 spectrum well .",
    "the reflection component fits the iron edge and contributes significantly to the soft excess emission thereby reducing the strength of the blackbody component .",
    "however , the blackbody temperature is still too high for an accretion disk .",
    "the primary x - ray continuum of seyfert type agn is thought to arise from thermal comptonization of soft photons from the disk by the hot electrons in the corona ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ) .",
    "such a comptonized spectrum deviates from the power - law form at low energies , in addition to the high energy cut - off , due to the maxwellian distribution of hot electrons ( see e.g. , titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , power - law is not an appropriate continuum to characterize the soft x - ray excess component . in the case of i",
    "zw  1 , the soft x - ray excess emission above a ` thermally comptonized continuum ' is well described by ionized reflection and blackbody .",
    "most importantly the temperature of the blackbody ( @xmath236 ) is consistent with that expected for the inner regions of an accretion disk around a @xmath237 black hole .",
    "thus the soft x - ray emission of the proto - type nls1 galaxy i  zw  1 is not unusual in terms of strength , temperature or variability time scale .",
    "we detected an iron k@xmath6 line at @xmath75 and an iron k - edge at @xmath238 .",
    "both the features arise from he - like iron and suggest that the accretion disk of i  zw  1 is ionized .",
    "evidence for ionized accretion disks have been found in many nls1 galaxies e.g. , ton  s180 ( vaughan et al . 2002 ; comastri et al . 1998 ) mrk  335 ( gondoin et al . 2002 ) , akn  564 ( vaughan et al . 1999 ) and are consistent with the general picture that accretion disks of agn with steep x - ray spectrum are ionized ( dewangan 2002 ) .",
    "the ionization stage of photo - ionized material is determined by the ionization parameter , @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the luminosity of ionizing photons , @xmath241 is the density of the material , and @xmath114 is the distance of the material from the ionizing source ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) . for standard thin disks , matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that the ionization parameter strongly depends on the accretion rate relative to the eddington rate , @xmath242 . in order to ionize he - like iron ,",
    "@xmath243 should be at least @xmath244 or @xmath245 ( matt et al .",
    "this result is consistent with the best - fit value of the ionization parameter derived from ionized reflection model .",
    "these observations have important implications to the nature of the soft x - ray excess emission as reflection from ionized material contributes substantially in the soft x - ray band , as revealed in the case of i  zw  1 .",
    "we presented timing and spectral characteristics of the proto - type nls1 galaxy i  zw  1 based on an _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the main results are as follows .    1 .   the @xmath246 spectrum of i  zw  1 , obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , consists of four intrinsic spectral components , namely a steep ( @xmath247 ) primary continuum , a soft x - ray excess component described by a blackbody ( @xmath236 ) and ionized reflection from the disk , iron features  k@xmath6 line and k - edge both from he - like",
    "iron arising due to reflection of the primary continuum , and an intrinsic photoelectric absorption component .",
    "i  zw  1 showed a large x - ray flare with changes in the luminosity @xmath8 on a time scale of @xmath248 . the radiative efficiency , @xmath249 , inferred from the flare is consistent with x - ray emission outside the last stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "x - ray spectrum of i  zw  1 hardened with flux during the observation .",
    "this behavior is uncommon among seyfert galaxies .",
    "the hardening of the @xmath10 is not only due to increase in the hard ( @xmath14 ) band flux but also due to hardening of the power - law component at higher fluxes .",

    "<S> we present results based on an _ xmm - newton _ observation of the prototype narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxy i  zw  1 performed in june 2002 . the @xmath0 spectrum is well described by a steep power - law ( @xmath1 ) and a weak soft blackbody component ( @xmath2 ) below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - ray excess emission is featureless and contributes only @xmath4 to the total x - ray emission in the @xmath5 band . </S>",
    "<S> there are tentative evidences for an iron iron k@xmath6 line and an iron k edge , both from high ionized he - like iron . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 continuum of i  zw  1 can be explained in terms of a blackbody ( @xmath7 ) , thermal comptonization and its reflection off the surface of an ionized accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we note that characterizing the soft excess copmonent ` above a power law continuum ' may not be appropriate due to the low energy curvature of a comptonized spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray emission from i  zw  1 was highly variabile during the observation . </S>",
    "<S> i  zw  1 showed a large , symmetric x - ray flare during which the x - ray luminosity increased by @xmath8 in an interval of @xmath9 only . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectral variability was unusual during the flare . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the general observation of spectral steepening with flux from seyfert galaxies , there is a clear evidence for hardening of the @xmath10 spectrum of i  zw  1 with increasing flux . </S>",
    "<S> this hardening is due to a stronger and slightly flatter power - law component at higher flux without any change in the soft x - ray excess component . </S>",
    "<S> the large flare , the accompanying spectral flattening , and the steady nature of the soft excess component may be due to an additional flatter power - law component during the flare possibly arising as a result of ejection of electron plasma and the ssc process . </S>"
