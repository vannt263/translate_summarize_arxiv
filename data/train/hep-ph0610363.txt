    "the standard model of the particle physics has been found to be in a good agreement with the experimental observations with almost a high precision . however , except for the higgs boson of the standard model which has not been observed yet , there are some other problems which directs physicists to a beyond standard model theory .",
    "some of the problems are mentioned below : gravitational interactions are not included in the standard model , within the standard model there is no candidate for the dark matter and there are some problems with the divergence of higgs mass .    presently , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the main candidate for the unified theory beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the mssm contains a two - higgs doublets sector in which one doublet couples to the up - type quarks and neutrinos and the other doublet couples to the down type quarks and charged leptons @xcite .",
    "search for supersymmetry in the nature is one of the main tasks of the experiments at colliders and non - accelerator experiments .",
    "however , there are still no any direct indications on the existence of supersymmetry satisfying all theoretical and experimental requirements .",
    "the scale of supersymmetry breaking might be around 1 tev which allows the tevatron and the lhc to explore supersymmetry .",
    "the mssm has been predicted the existence of the charged higgs boson .",
    "there have been many searches for the charged higgs boson at the lep and the tevatron and search for charged higgs is one of the main tasks at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath5 pairs , with theoretical production cross section of 6.7 pb ( at the tevatron ) and 830 pb ( at the lhc ) , may offer a large source of charged higgs production .",
    "if kinematically allowed , the top quark can decay to @xmath6 , competing with the sm decay mode @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism not only provide a large production rate , in particular at the lhc , but also a clean signature for the light charged higgs @xcite .",
    "the results of direct and indirect searches for the charged higgs at the lep and the tevatron excluded the region of @xmath8 gev / c@xmath9 ( assuming @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and the very low values of @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the dependency of the _ asymmetry _ or _ spin correlation coefficient _ of the charged lepton produced from a charged higgs in the decay of a polarized top quark on the mass of the charged higgs and @xmath1 .",
    "asymmetry of the charged lepton is strongly dependent on @xmath13 and @xmath1 and could be used in separation of the signal from backgrounds in the experimental searches and for extracting some bounds on the ( @xmath4 ) plane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 gives a brief description of the top quark spin correlations at hadron colliders .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to present the results of @xmath14 .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion in the standard model with the mass of  175 gev / c@xmath9 .",
    "such a large mass leads to a very short life time ( @xmath15s ) which is one order of magnitude smaller than the qcd hadronization time scale ( @xmath16s ) . therefore ,",
    "unlike the other quarks it decays before hadronization and its spin information is transferred to its final products .",
    "the dominant sm decay chain is @xmath17",
    ".    the angular distributions of the final products of a spin - up top quark are simply linear in the cosine of the decay angles : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle between the _ i_th decay product and the spin vector of the top quark in the rest frame of the top quark and @xmath20 is called _ asymmetry _ or _",
    "spin correlation coefficient_. the charged lepton and the down type quarks are maximally correlated with the top quark spin with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that top quarks produced at hadron colliders are scarcely polarized . as a result , the correlations between top spin and anti - top spin in the @xmath5 is considered @xcite . in order to illustrate we consider the dileptonic decay of the @xmath5 events in hadron colliders :",
    "@xmath22 the double differential angular distribution of the leptons coming form the top and anti",
    "- top in the ordinary sm is @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24@xmath25 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath26 in the rest frame of the @xmath27 and the @xmath27 direction in the @xmath5 center of mass .",
    "@xmath28 is the number of top pair events where both quarks have spin up or spin down and @xmath29 is the number of top pair events where one quark is spin up and the other is spin down .",
    "eq.([spintt ] ) shows the strong dependence of the experimental observable , @xmath30 , to the asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) . for the @xmath5 production at the tevatron and the lhc ,",
    "the sm predicts @xmath32 , respectively . in @xcite , it has been shown that @xmath30 will be measured very precisely at the lhc .",
    "the lagrangians describing the @xmath33 and @xmath34 vertices in the mssm read as follows @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the chiral projection operators , v@xmath37 is the ckm element which is set to one in the rest of this work . because charged higgs couplings are proportional to fermion masses , the decays to the third generation of the quarks and leptons are dominant . in particular , for the light charged higgs coming from a top quark when @xmath1 is large enough ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , which is an apparent breakdown of the @xmath40 universality @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : br ] shows the branching fractions of the charged higgs boson as a function of @xmath1 corresponding to four different values of the charged higgs boson mass @xcite .    using the lagrangians from eq.([lag ] ) , the squared matrix element for the reaction @xmath41 has the following form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fermi constant , @xmath44 is the polarization four - vector of the top quark , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the charged higgs mass and the full width of the charged higgs , respectively .    after following the same method as used in @xcite and performing some algebra the double differential @xmath47 , energy - angular , distributions in the point - like four fermion limit",
    "is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the energy of the charged lepton , and @xmath51 is the angle between the spin of the top quark and the momentum of the lepton in the rest frame of the top quark . in deriving eq.([dwidth ] ) , the narrow width approximation of the charged higgs has been used : @xmath52 it is more useful to express the eq.([dwidth ] ) in the following way : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , _ correlation coefficient _ or _ asymmetry _ , is : @xmath55    in the ordinary standard model and in the limit of vanishing the lepton masses , @xmath31 is independent of @xmath56 and is equal to one @xcite . as a result of eq.([dwidth1 ] ) , the angular distribution of the final charged lepton in the decay of a polarized top via a charged higgs is linear in cosine of the decay angle , the same form as the ordinary standard model , except for the case that @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , an interesting observation is that when @xmath58 the angular distribution of the final charged lepton is not linear in @xmath59 and is constant .    according to eq.([dwidth ] ) and eq.([dwidth1 ] ) the asymmetry , @xmath31 ,",
    "depends on the charged higgs mass and @xmath1 .",
    "after integration over @xmath56 in eq.([dwidth ] ) @xmath31 can be extracted , fig.[fig : corrcoef ] shows the dependence of the @xmath31 on the @xmath45 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that there is a significant difference from the standard model .",
    "according to the recent searches for the light charged higgs in @xmath60 @xcite , the most dangerous background is @xmath61 ( with at least one @xmath62 decaying leptonically ) .",
    "fig.[fig : spin ] , shows the distributions of the eq.([spintt ] ) for the standard model case in the dileptonic decay mode ( left ) , for the @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( the middle distribution ) and the distribution in the right side shows the difference of the middle and the left distributions . according to the right distribution in fig.[fig : spin ] , in the case of @xmath63 events prefer to be in the regions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 rather than the standard model case .",
    "therefore , constructing the distribution of eq.([spintt ] ) and applying some optimal cuts on the @xmath68 and @xmath69 might suppress the @xmath70 background and leads to a better significance and cleaner signal in the searches for the charged higgs produced in the @xmath5 .",
    "measurement of the @xmath30 in eq.([spintt ] ) can help to achieve some new bounds on the ( @xmath4 ) plane .",
    "the angular distribution of the produced charged lepton ( @xmath71 ) in the decay of a polarized top quark via a charged higgs was studied . the same as the standard model , this distribution is linear in cosine of the angle between the spin of the top and the momentum of the charged lepton except for the case of @xmath72 .",
    "the asymmetry , which is somehow experimentally observable , is dependent on the @xmath13 and @xmath1 and differs from the standard model value significantly . in the study of the light charged higgs generated from @xmath5 at the hadron collider , in particular at the lhc with a lot of @xmath5 events ( eight millions per year ) ,",
    "the @xmath5 spin correlation can help seriously to suppress backgrounds .",
    "it also might be useful to obtain bounds on the ( @xmath4 ) plane .",
