    "on the other hand , photons and neutrinos , which are generated in the sources , can be more beamed and coincident with their activities . for transients , due to the difficulty in revealing the sources with uhecrs , it is more favorable to detect photons and neutrinos .",

    "( 2004 ) . for the uncertain crb , we take the high crb model in protheroe & biermann ( 1996 ) , but we also consider cases without the crb .    first , to see basic features of the emission from structured regions , we consider a steady source using an analytical injection spectrum",

    "note that the tev emission is observed as a point source since @xmath105 ( while the almost steady and unbeamed , synchrotron pair halo emission could be expected at @xmath82  gev ) .",
    "next , we take grbs as examples of transient sources . for steady sources , the emission may be contaminated by other emissions from the source and runaway uhecrs , whereas it makes a unique signal for transients owing to @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the source duration . to evaluate @xmath41 accurately and discuss detectability in more detail",
    ", we here calculate primary spectra of pionic @xmath0 rays leaving the source using a detailed numerical code for the @xmath10 reaction  @xcite , where spectra of generated and runaway @xmath0 rays are obtained , taking account of @xmath48 in the emission region  @xcite .",
    "calculations are first executed in the comoving frame , and then transformed to results in the observer frame .",
    "we assume the @xmath108 spectrum of protons escaping from the acceleration zone , with given @xmath109 ( that is limited by @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the parameter of the acceleration region , @xmath112 ) .    in figure  3 , we show energy fluences of @xmath0 rays for @xmath113  erg ( which is consistent with the uhecr energy budget @xmath114 and the local hl grb rate @xmath115 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , with different strengths of the structured egmf .",
    "using @xmath116 , we also calculate fluences of @xmath0 rays received in @xmath117  yr , and we obtain @xmath118 in the tev range .",
    "the fluxes averaged over @xmath117  yr are @xmath119 ( and fluxes at earlier times are larger , @xmath120 at @xmath121  yr after the burst , and intrinsically harder ) , while the cta sensitivity for integration time of 50  hr is @xmath122 at @xmath3  tev  @xcite , so synchrotron pair echoes from hl grbs at @xmath123 are detectable with follow - up observations .",
    "the high altitude water cherenkov experiment ( hawc ) has lower sensitivity ( @xmath124 for one - year observation ) but will also be helpful for closer bursts .",
    "the results agree with analytical estimates , and higher - energy @xmath0 rays have shorter time spreads while @xmath3  gev @xmath0 rays can not be observed by _ fermi _ because they are suppressed by long time delays .",
    "note that prompt emission from the source ceases after @xmath125  s , whereas almost steady synchrotron emission induced by uhecrs escaping from the source is negligible since its flux ratio to the uhe - photon - induced synchrotron emission is @xmath126 ( at @xmath127  tev ) for uhecr production with @xmath128 . here",
    "mpc is the energy loss length of @xmath130  ev protons .",
    "as suggested in murase et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , low - luminosity ( ll ) grbs such as grb 060218 ( @xmath131  mpc ) and grb 980425 ( @xmath132  mpc ) may be more important as local uhecr sources , since they are dimmer but more common than hl grbs  @xcite . in figure  4 , we show @xmath0-ray fluences for @xmath133  erg ( implied by their local rate , @xmath134 ; liang et al . 2007 ) . expected fluences for a burst at 20  mpc ( e.g. , in the virgo cluster ) are @xmath118 , so the synchrotron signal can be seen by cta for nearby bursts as in the case shown in figure  3 .    we have considered that @xmath0 rays are attenuated in voids .",
    "this is reasonable for gev - tev @xmath0 rays from transients , since some lower limits ( @xmath135  g ) are strong enough  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( and strong @xmath136 seems favored for hl grbs to be uhecr sources ; murase & takami 2009 ) , or the ic emission may be suppressed by isotropization via plasma instabilities .",
    "but , we show the ic cascade for generality .",
    "its flux ratio in the tev range is @xmath137 , so the ic pair echo from the void region can be important if @xmath138  g. also , the ic pair echo induced by runaway uhecrs is less significant , since its flux ratio to the uhe - photon - induced synchrotron pair echo is at most @xmath139 ( depending on the uncertain escaping fraction and beaming of uhecrs ) , which will even be smaller when @xmath140  g.    note that time spread of cascade uhe photons is much shorter , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , so they may be detected for nearby transient sources  @xcite .",
    "( the diffuse uhe photon background is dominated by cosmogenic uhe photons produced by runaway uhecrs , due to @xmath143 , and consistent with the pao limits . )",
    "results are also shown in figure  4 , taking account of escape from the structured region ( while murase 2009 simply assumed that @xmath144 of @xmath0 rays are lost ) .",
    "uhe photons and accompanied uhe pairs may pass another structured region , including the local supercluster , and/or our galaxy , where we expect further synchrotron pair echo emission , which enhances detectability .",
    "we studied effects of the magnetized environment embedding uhecr accelerators , and then showed that uhe photon beams inevitably lead to synchrotron emission .",
    "in particular , any uhe @xmath0-ray burst or flare should produce a characteristic echo with @xmath145 \\ll \\delta t_{\\rm cr}$ ] in the tev range , from the immediate environment , galaxy groups and clusters , filaments , and all corresponding sites surrounding the source .",
    "note that our results are conservative in that the fluxes can be higher if @xmath0 rays are attenuated by possible additional photon fields in the immediate environment .",
    "the signal is detectable by future hawc and cta . for the echo , observations with other wavelengths and messengers",
    "are relevant to trigger coordinated search ( especially for cta ) and estimate source parameters .",
    "then detecting a @xmath146  yr transient in the tev range may suggest the accelerator in the magnetized regions with @xmath147  mpc .",
    "observing synchrotron spectra and light curves can also provide invaluable information on the egmfs as well as properties of the sources .",
    "importantly , the signal is useful to identify _ distant extragalactic accelerators _ beyond @xmath148  mpc , and it will favor powerful @xmath9  ev proton accelerators over heavy ion sources  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible to consider the galactic transient origin for heavy nuclei around @xmath149  eev , but the emissions from their extragalactic counterparts are weak  @xcite .",
    "synchrotron pair echo emission induced by runaway uhe photons from transients becomes more prominent than other emissions , after @xmath107 ( for source emission including hadronic and leptonic @xmath0 rays ) , since @xmath86 is shorter than @xmath150 ( for synchrotron emission induced by runaway uhecrs ) .",
    "it is applicable to uhecr production associated with agn flares ( @xmath151  s ) , grb prompt emission and afterglows . though grb afterglow emission may last longer , its flux declines with time as @xmath152 after @xmath153  s and @xmath154 after the jet break time of @xmath3  day  @xcite , so the pair echo can be dominant and the temporal behaviors are distinguishable . for steady sources ,",
    "discrimination would be harder , but the source emission will be more variable and the almost steady uhecr - induced emission may be less relevant if most uhecrs are isotropized or cooled before they escape .    discriminating between the synchrotron and ic pair echoes would also be possible .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum typically has @xmath155 as distinct from the hard ic cascade spectrum ( see figure  4 ) , @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( where @xmath158 is the cutoff by the cmb or cib ) . also , @xmath86 is generally different from @xmath159 .",
