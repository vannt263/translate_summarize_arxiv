    "clusters of galaxies are filled with an x - ray emitting icm .",
    "the icm is not only a dominant baryon component in the nearby universe but also contains comparable or much amount of heavy elements than those in galaxies .",
    "therefore , the distribution and composition of metals in the icm is essential for understanding the history of metals in galaxies and clusters .    following early measurements , _ asca _ and",
    "_ bepposax _ observations have revealed several important properties of the icm metallicity .",
    "these include fe abundance increases around cd galaxies ( e.g. fukazawa 1998 ; de grandi and molendi 2001 ) and variations in si / fe ratio within a cluster ( e.g. finoguenov et al . 2000 ) and among clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations with higher capability should improve the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "in particular , thanks to the high spectral resolution ( rgs ) and better sensitivity ( epic ) in the soft x - ray band , significant improvement of the o abundance determination is expected .",
    "the o abundance is crucial to understand the origin of the icm metal since o is expected to be produced mostly by sne ii .",
    "early results from _ xmm - newton _ of srsic  159 - 03 , a  1835 , a  1795 , and a  496 were reported in kaastra et al .",

    "we present new results of abundance measurements .",
    "table  [ ttamura - b3_tbl : sample ] summaries our sample .",

    "our measurements of the elemental abundances along with the _ xmm - newton _ results of m87 ( bhringer et al .",
    "2001 ) are summaried in fig .",

    "main results are followings .    1",
    ".   the average ( and standard variance among clusters ) of the o / fe ratio around the cd galaxy are 0.5 ( and 0.16 ) times the solar value , respectively .",
    "2 .   those of the o / fe , ne / fe , si / fe , s / fe , and ( ar = ca)/fe in the outer region of clusters are 0.80 ( 0.17 ) , 0.7 ( 0.6 ) , 1.11 ( 0.29 ) , 1.06 ( 0.24 ) , and 1.2 ( 1.0 ) solar , respectively . these variances among clusters are comparable to the statistical errors and insignificant .",
    "3 .   there is significant change in the o / fe ratio between the center and outer regions of clusters .",
    "fukazawa et al.(1998 ) measured si and fe abundances in @xmath0 40  clusters excluding the central cool region .",
    "they reported that the si / fe ratio varies depending on the icm temperature ; groups and poor clusters ( @xmath1  kev ) have si / fe of @xmath0 1 solar , while rich clusters exhibit a higher value of 23 solar . since our sample consists of groups and poor clusters ( 1.24  kev ) , our results of si / fe @xmath0 1 solar is roughly consistent with the asca measurements .",
    "we interpret our new abundance measurements along with other _ xmm - newton _ results . here",
    "we assume that the distribution of the abundance ratios in the icm have not change since the ejection of those metals from galaxies .",
    "however , we should note that the change in si / fe ratio among clusters from the asca results suggests that a large amount of @xmath2-elements such as o , si , and s have selectively escaped from the gravitational potential in poorer systems ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the result ( 2 ) indicates that in member galaxies in the clusters metal has been enriched in a similar way to that in solar neighborhood , and then ejected into the intergalactic space .",
    "then , we compare the observed abundance ratios among o , si , s , and fe with a mixture of sn ia and sn ii prediction in fig .",
    "[ ttamura - b3_fig : sniaii ] .",
    "this comparison indicates that the observed o : si : s : fe ratio is consistent with a sn ia originating fe mass fraction of 0.60.8 ( or equivalently a sn ia / sn ii frequency ratio of 0.20.7 ) .",
    "how about the cluster center ?",
    "the result ( 3 ) implies that there are at least two different origins for the metals in the icm , irrespective of any theoretical model for the metal production .",
    "an increase of the relative contribution from sne ia in the cd galaxy to the metal production towards the center is one possibility .",
    "this is because a sn ia is supposed to produce o / fe ratio smaller than the solar value .",
    "in fact , fukazawa et al . (",
    "1998 ) found that the excess fe mass around the cd galaxy in general can be produced by the standard sn ia rate over a hubble time .",
    "the abundances of other elements such as si and s at the cluster center , which is not addressed here , are important to examine this idea more quantitatively ( fukazawa 1998 ; finoguenov et al .",
