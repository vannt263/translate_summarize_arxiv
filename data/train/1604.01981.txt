    "it has infinite number of branches distinguished by a subscript @xmath19 , especially @xmath20 is called the principal branch . if @xmath21 , then for @xmath22 , @xmath23 has two possible real values as shown in fig .",

    "the branch satisfying @xmath24 is designated by @xmath25 and the branch satisfying @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the concept of branches has been discussed in @xcite and hence not included here .",
    "in this section , we extend the applicability of the approach presented in @xcite from second order to _ _ n__th order system .",
    "we propose a new class of systems which can be transformed into the cc form of tds using state variable transformation to exploit these results .",
    "for this first we define the cc form of tds .",
    "a tds ( [ eq1 ] ) is said to be in cc form if @xmath28 is in companion form and @xmath29 has all its rows zero except for the _ _ n__th row and is represented as @xmath30    in @xcite , it is shown that the eigenspectrum of a second order tds in the cc form , can be associated with only real branches of lambert w function .",
    "these results have been extended for a _ _ n__th order system and stated in the form of a theorem .",
    "for this , we assume that ( [ eq4 ] ) is real and in companion form .",
    "the whole eigenspectrum of the system ( [ eq1 ] ) can be associated with only two real branches , @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the lambert _ w _ function if it is in cc form .    using the structure of @xmath2 in ( [ eq6 ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath9 , for any given @xmath33 , has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 are scalars",
    ". based on the value of the element @xmath36 there are two possible cases : +    @xmath37    * case 1 : @xmath38 * + the matrix lambert w function of @xmath13 is obtained as @xmath39 @xmath40 therefore , matrix lambert _ w _",
    "function of matrix @xmath13 , is the @xmath13 matrix itself multiplied by a scalar constant @xmath41 . using ( [ eq8 ] ) , @xmath10 is written as ( [ eq9 ] ) , and given in ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "@xmath42 * case 2 : @xmath43 * + when @xmath43 , then by using the following property @xmath44 we have @xmath45 .",
    "hence , @xmath10 is given as @xmath46 furthermore , the concept used here is to perform the steps given in section 1 , in reverse order to attribute branch index @xmath47 . for this purpose",
    "we first formulate a real matrix @xmath10 , which can be written in terms of its eigenvalues as @xmath48 where @xmath49 + @xmath50 , + @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite . comparing ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , yields + @xmath53 for real @xmath10",
    ", @xmath13 is real .",

    "the change of variables is represented by a linear transformation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the state vector in the transformed domain .",

    "obtains @xmath82 where @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents any value .",
    "finally , from ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) , we observed that @xmath85 has a structure @xmath86 , which is the cc form of time delay systems .",
    "the above analysis shows that after transforming the system ( [ eq21 ] ) into the cc form all the characteristics roots can be computed using only real branches of the lambert w function corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is illustrated by an example in the subsequent section .",
    "the above results are used to design a stabilizing controller by assigning a subset of eigenvalues of the closed loop system in the subsequent section .      controller design for time delay systems based on eigenvalue assignment",
    "has already been discussed in @xcite , but in this approach , to find the auxiliary matrix @xmath7 is difficult and also , it is a hit and trial approach to find the controller @xmath87 , with a specific set of initial conditions .",
    "these issues can be bypassed by the approach presented here .",
    "consider a time delay system with input delay @xmath88 with feedback control @xmath89 the closed - loop system is written as @xmath90 the solution matrix is written in terms of lambert _ w _ function as @xmath91 where @xmath92 . to assign the desired eigenvalues of tds in left half of the complex plane , controller gain @xmath87",
    "is obtained by the following algorithm    select desired characteristic roots @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "create a matrix @xmath10 using ( [ eq12 ] ) , so that it returns selected eigenvalues .",
    "obtain @xmath95 from ( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "compute @xmath13 from step 3 .",
    "substitute @xmath96 in @xmath92 and then compare both sides of it to obtain @xmath87 .",
    "this approach fixes the @xmath33 matrix for a subset of eigenvalues , hence resolves the trouble of selecting appropriate auxiliary matrix .",
    "the controller gain is the only parameter to be found instead of @xmath87 and @xmath33 of the eigenvalue assignment method . since it is a straight - forward method , therefore , no need of hit and trial using different sets of initial conditions to assign the selected eigenvalues at desired locations @xcite .    using algorithm 1 ,",
    "a subset of closed loop characteristic roots can be placed at desired locations .",
    "but it does not guarantee the overall stability of the system . in the literature",
    ", it is reported that the roots corresponding to the principal branch of lambert w function gives the rightmost root which determines stability .",
    "however , recent study of @xcite claims that for the systems in cc form several roots are associated with the principal branch and practically , it is hard enough to identify that which one is the rightmost among them . therefore , the lambert w function based method alone , is not well suited to guarantee the stability .",
    "hence , in the present study , stability is investigated with the help of nyquist plot which guarantees the stability by ensuring that the roots placed at desired locations using the approach presented above are rightmost one and is given in the following subsection .      system ( [ eq1 ] ) is stable , if all the roots of characteristic polynomial @xmath97 , have negative real parts .",
    "stability of this system is investigated using the following definition which is based on the nyquest stability criteria for time delay systems@xcite .",
    "a linear - time - invariant system with delay is said to be asymptotically stable if and only if the nyquist plot of @xmath98 does not encircle the origin of the complex plane , where @xmath99 is the degree of @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 , then @xmath102 if and only if @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 is the rightmost root if it satisfies the following conditions    * the nyquist plot of @xmath105 passes through the origin , and * the nyquist plot of @xmath106 does not encounter the origin of the complex plane for every small @xmath107 .    therefore ,",
    "if the nyquist diagram does not encircle the origin , then it is confirmed that the rightmost root that guarantee the stability has been computed correctly .",
    "this approach is demonstrated in following illustrative examples .",
    "* example 1 : * consider a time delay system which is not in cc form , with matrices given as @xmath108 the state variable transformation matrix @xmath75 is @xmath109 and the transformed system into the cc form is obtained as @xmath110 in pursuance of obtaining an analytical estimate of @xmath33 , we use reverse - engineeringapproach , as in the proof of theorem 1 . for this ,",
    "first the roots of the system are obtained using qpmr algorithm @xcite .",
    "let the dominant roots of the system be @xmath111 .",
    "corresponding to these roots @xmath10 matrix is @xmath112 from ( [ eq41 ] ) we have @xmath113 , which is the range of the principal branch of the lambert w function .",
    "therefore , there exists a matrix @xmath13 for which ( [ eq41 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath31 , and that matrix is @xmath114 since @xmath2 and @xmath115 are singular matrices , hence there are infinite number of @xmath116 matrices that satisfy ( [ eq42 ] ) for @xmath31 .",
    "one of such matrices is @xmath117 the difficulty of making initial guess for auxiliary matrix @xmath116 has been resolved using this method .",
    "if this value of @xmath116 is taken as starting value while solving nonlinear equation ( [ eq5 ] ) using lambert w function based method for @xmath31 then corresponding @xmath10 matrix and its eigenvalues are obtained after few iterations , and computation time is very small approximately less than @xmath118 or @xmath119 sec .",
    "+ now let us choose some other characteristic roots as @xmath120 .",
    "corresponding to these roots @xmath10 matrix is @xmath121 from this we have @xmath122 , which is the range of the @xmath31 branch .",
    "therefore , matrix @xmath115 for which ( [ eq43 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath31 , is @xmath123 using this @xmath124 matrix is obtained as @xmath125 which is a solution to ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath126 . choosing initial conditions close to this matrix assures convergence to this solution .",
    "[ eigen ] shows some characteristic roots of the system in example 1 , computed using @xmath31 & @xmath32 branches .         +",
    "thus it is shown that how the whole eigenspectrum of a class of systems with the structure specified in ( [ eq21 ] ) is analysed using only two branches of the lambert w function and the appropriate initial conditions for the solution of the nonlinear equation ( [ eq5 ] ) are obtained .",
