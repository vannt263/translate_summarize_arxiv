    "from the theoretical side , the most interesting problem in medium energy physics is the mechanisms of strong qcd . particularly , explicit glue tests qcd s strong gluonic interactions . the spectroscopy of the new states of matter with explicit glue , called _ gluonic hadrons _ , is essentially unknown . within the taxa of possible gluonic hadrons ,",
    "charmonium hybrids are under better theoretical control , due to heavy quarks , and experimentally cleaner , due to smaller widths , than light flavour hybrids .",
    "glueball masses are well known theoretically , and there is the possibility that glueballs may be narrow in experiment .",
    "the kinematics of a @xmath1 with energy @xmath3 colliding with a @xmath4 at rest are expressed by @xmath5 with @xmath6 the centre - of - mass energy and @xmath7 the mass of the proton .",
    "an immediate application of this formula is that for @xmath8 gev , @xmath9 mev .",
    "as we shall see , this is perfectly sufficient for the study of hybrid charmonia and multi - gev glueballs .",
    "the main qualitatively - new physics of interest above this @xmath6 region are the lowest - mass experimentally - undiscovered baryons with new flavours : double - charmed baryons .",
    "these will have @xmath10 mev , so that @xmath11 gev .",
    "also of interest are the lowest - mass new - flavoured mesons : bottom - charm mesons . here",
    "@xmath12 gev  @xcite and @xmath13 gev .",
    "it is clear that there are vast energy deserts between @xmath3 of 10 gev , 27 gev and 86 gev .",
    "the competition for the physics program outlined here comes from the proposed glue / charm factory at gsi darmstadt , where @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "these are charm - anticharm - glue composites . many quenched lattice - qcd mass predictions for unmixed hybrid charmonium are available .",
    "hence masses are under theoretical control .",
    "the quantum numbers of the eight low - lying hybrids are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "decays are under less control , although there is a fairly general selection rule stating that the low - lying hybrid charmonia do not decay to @xmath19 and have only small decays to @xmath20 . these final states are called _",
    "open charm_. the selection rule holds for ozi - allowed decay with nonrelativistic quarks .",
    "the @xmath21 pair is assumed to be created with nonrelativistic spin 1  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of meson decay strongly supports spin 1 pair creation .",
    "the specific case of the @xmath22 hybrid is particularly interesting .",
    "its decays to @xmath23 are forbidden by general principles due to quantum numbers . the threshold for one orbitally - excited and one ground - state charmed meson , the @xmath24 threshold , is at 4290 mev . below this threshold hybrid charmonium",
    "is narrow .",
    "total widths for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states have , for example , been estimated as respectively @xmath27 mev below the threshold  @xcite . the main conclusion to draw",
    "is that there is a strong possibility that hybrid charmonia are narrower than the @xmath28 mev/@xmath29 widths of conventional charmonia in the same mass region  @xcite .",
    "the most obvious search channel is the decay of hybrid charmonium to conventional charmonium and light hadrons .",
    "this final state signals the @xmath30 nature of initial state .",
    "the most easily detected conventional charmonium is the @xmath31 with a substantial branching ratio into dileptons  @xcite .    in @xmath32 annihilation at lear",
    "there are indications that the light - flavour hybrid - meson candidates @xmath33 and @xmath34 are produced with substantial cross sections @xcite , comparable to or slightly less than conventional mesons .",
    "this is the main production process studied to date where hybrid mesons are significantly produced , underscoring the utility of @xmath32 annihilation as a choice for hybrid production .",
    "these are gluonic composites without quark content .",
    "good quenched lattice - qcd mass predictions are available for unmixed glueballs , providing theoretical control .",
    "unmixed glueballs are believed to be narrow because the process whereby @xmath21 pairs are created to enable decay into mesons is forbidden by the ozi rule .",
    "i shall outline three further reasons to believe that multi - gev glueballs are narrow .",
    "firstly , the flattening of the linear confining potential between quarks due to pair creation at large @xmath21 separations implies that there are no light - flavour conventional mesons @xmath35 mev/@xmath29 in mass  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the mixing of glueballs with charmonium is likely to be small due to the penalty incurred by the creation of a @xmath30 pair .",
    "these arguments suggest that the glueball will not mix substantially with light - flavour conventional mesons or charmonia .",
    "thirdly , as will be demonstrated below , most multi - gev glueballs in the mass region of interest do not decay to two other glueballs because of quantum numbers .",
    "the above strongly argue that multi - gev glueballs are narrow .",
    "the main fly in the ointment is the possibility of mixing with light - flavour hybrid mesons .",
    "the production of the glueball candidate @xmath36 in @xmath32 annihilation at lear is substantial , comparable to other mesons , but weaker than , for example , the @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath32 annihilation is well suited for glueball production .",
    "in fact , it is commonly thought to be a `` glue - rich '' process .",
    "the main focus of this paper will be on hybrid charmonium .",
    "the discussions of hybrid charmonium and the glueball are somewhat different because hybrid charmonium s telltale decay to @xmath31 and light hadrons is so different from the purely light - hadron decays expected for the glueball .",
    "as we shall see , there is also a large difference in production cross sections .",
    "when a list of the possible @xmath0 of conventional mesons is made , there are certain @xmath0 s which are not possible .",
    "these `` exotic '' @xmath38 immediately indicate that the state is not a conventional meson . in the mass region of interest , it is most likely to be hybrid charmonium or a glueball , or possibly a four - quark state ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the detection of a @xmath0 exotic state must hence be assigned the highest priority in the search for gluonic mesons .",
    "the advantage is that they can not mix with conventional mesons .",
    "the flip side of the coin is that the @xmath0 must be established experimentally , _",
    "i.e. _  one needs detailed angular distributions and preferably a full partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) .",
    "a search for @xmath0-exotic states would unambiguously isolate gluonic mesons .",
    "however , the second program represents substantially higher cross sections and does not absolutely require partial - wave analysis ."
