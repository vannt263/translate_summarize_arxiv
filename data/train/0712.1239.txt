    "the enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with heavy elements has , over the past decade , become a key tool in understanding star and galaxy formation by providing a fossil record of metal formation and galactic feedback .",
    "absorption line spectroscopy has revealed , among other findings , that the low - density ( @xmath10 ) intergalactic medium ( igm ) , as probed by the ly@xmath11  forest and through , , , , , , and other transitions , is at least partly enriched at all redshifts and densities probed .",
    "in particular , recent studies indicate that :    * when smoothed over large ( @xmath12  kpc ) scales , the abundance of carbon decreases as gas overdensity @xmath13 does and has a scatter of @xmath14dex at fixed density .",
    "there is carbon in at least some gas at all densities down to at least the mean cosmic density , with the median carbon metallicity obeying [ c / h ] @xmath15 at @xmath16  ( schaye et al .  2003 , hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "* on smaller ( @xmath17  kpc ) scales the distribution of metals is less well known , but observations suggest that the metals may be concentrated in small , high - metallicity patches @xcite .",
    "* there is no evidence for metallicity evolution from redshift @xmath18 to @xmath19  @xcite and metals exist at some level at @xmath20  @xcite .    in connection with this",
    "observed widespread distribution of metals , a general picture has emerged that galactic winds  driven largely from young and/or starburst galaxies  have enriched the igm .",
    "the same feedback may account for the dearth of low - luminosity galaxies relative to the halo mass function  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also for the mass - metallicity relationship of galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a detailed understanding of the various feedback processes is lacking and there are still open questions and controversies concerning the time and relative importance of the various enrichment processes , and concerning the implications for galaxy formation .",
    "both theoretical modeling and observations of intergalactic ( ig ) enrichment are now advancing to the point where comparison between the two can provide crucial insight into these issues , but this comparison is not without problems .",
    "two key difficulties concern the ionization correction required to convert observed ionic abundances into elemental abundances .",
    "first , while the oft - studied ions and are observationally convenient , they are poor probes of hot ( @xmath21k ) gas , because the ion factions /c and /si both fall dramatically with temperature .",
    "thus , the hot remnants of fast outflows might be largely invisible in these ions .",
    "second , the dominant uncertainty in both the absolute and relative abundance inferences stems from uncertainty in the spectral shape of the ultraviolet ionizing background radiation ( uvb ) .",
    "analysis of oxygen , as probed by , has the potential to shed light on both problems : this ionization state becomes prevalent in some of the very phases in which and become rare , and its abundance depends on the uvb shape differently than those of other ions , helping break the degeneracy between abundances and uvb shape .",
    "the challenge posed by is that at @xmath22 it is strongly contaminated by both ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath23 lines , making its identification and quantification difficult .",
    "previous studies of high-@xmath24 oxygen enrichment using line fitting  @xcite or pixel statistics  @xcite have reliably detected oxygen in the igm , and quantified its abundance in relatively dense gas , but have not assessed the oxygen abundance with a very large data sample , at very low - densities , or in a unified treatment with other available ions .",
    "here we extend to our application of the  pixel optical depth \" technique  ( e.g. , aguirre , schaye & theuns , hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to a large set of high quality vlt / uves and keck / hires spectra .",
    "the results , when combined with previous studies of and  @xcite and of and  ( aguirre et .",
    "2004 ; hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , give a comprehensive observational assessment of ig enrichment by carbon , silicon and oxygen , with significantly reduced uncertainties due to the uvb shape , as well as new data on the importance of hot , collisionally ionized gas .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows . in   [ sec - data ] and  [ sec - overview ] we briefly describe our sample of qso spectra .",
    "the analysis method is described briefly in  [ sec - overview ] and then in greater depth in the remainder of  [ sec - meth ] , with heavy reference to papers i , ii and iii . the basic results are given in  [ sec - resrel ] and discussed in  [ sec - discuss ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ sec - conc ] .",

    "this was found to result in smaller errors than using the full region .",

    "the basic method for analysis of each qso spectrum is as follows :    1 .",
    "optical depths due to ly@xmath11  ( @xmath35   ) absorption are recovered for all pixels in the ly@xmath11  forest region , using higher - order lyman lines to estimate optical depths for saturated pixels .",
    "the pixel optical depth at the corresponding wavelengths of the metal lines  ( @xmath36 ) ,  ( @xmath37 ) , and  ( @xmath38 ) are recovered , making several corrections to reduce contamination and noise .",
    "the recovered optical depth in one transition is compared with that of another , by binning the pixels in terms of the optical depth of , , or , and plotting the median ( or some other percentile of ) optical depth of .",
    "a correlation then indicates a detection of  absorption .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oviscat ] .    as was done in papers ii and iii ,",
    "an identical analysis is applied to synthetic spectra generated using a cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation , kindly provided by tom theuns . for each observed quasar",
    "we generate 50 corresponding simulated spectra with the same noise properties , wavelength coverage , instrumental broadening , and pixel size as the observed spectra . for each uvb model (",
    "of which several are used ; see below ) the carbon distribution as measured in paper ii , and the value of [ si / c ] from paper iii , are imposed on the fiducial spectra .",
    "an oxygen abundance is assigned by assuming a _ constant , uniform _ value of [ o / c ] .",
    "ionization balances are calculated using cloudy(version 94 ; see ferland et al .",
    "1998 and ferland 2000 for details ) .",
    "a direct comparison of the results from these simulated and observed spectra allows for inferences about the distribution of oxygen , carbon , and silicon .",
    "the same simulation was used in papers i (  3 ) , ii , and iii , to which the reader is referred for details .",
    "this study employs the identical uvb models used in papers ii (  4.2 ) and iii , excluding model `` qgs3.2 '' .",
    "all models are from haardt & madau ( 2001 , hereafter hm01 ) .",
    "these have been renormalized ( by a redshift - dependent factor ) such that the simulated spectra match the observed evolution of the mean ly@xmath11 absorption ( paper ii ) .",
    "the fiducial model , `` qg '' , includes contributions from both galaxies ( with a 10% escape fraction for ionizing photons ) and quasars ; `` q '' includes only quasars ; `` qgs '' is an artificially softened version of qg : its flux has been reduced by a factor of ten above 4  ryd .",
    "the uvb used in the simulation only affects the igm temperature , and was chosen to match the measurements by  @xcite .",
    "a major source of error in  optical depths is continuum fitting in the  absorption region , where contamination by ly@xmath11  and ly@xmath23  lines is heavy . to make this fitting as accurate as possible , and to furnish an estimate of the continuum fitting error , we have applied the following procedure to the region analyzed for  absorption ( in the case of observed spectra , this was done after the spectra",
    "had been continuum fitted by eye as described in paper ii  2 ) :    1 .",
    "the spectral region is divided into 20  ( rest - frame ) segments .",
    "2 .   in segments with large unabsorbed regions , an automatic continuum fitting algorithm",
    "is applied ( see  5.1 of paper ii ) , in which pixels @xmath39 below the continuum are iteratively removed .",
    "3 .   in segments without large unabsorbed regions , we identify small unabsorbed regions or regions absorbed only in ly@xmath23 ; the latter are identified by superimposing the region of the spectrum corresponding to ly@xmath11 absorption .",
    "the continuum level of the segment is fit by minimizing the deviation of identified unabsorbed regions from unit flux , and deviation of the ly@xmath23  regions from the corresponding scaled ly@xmath11 features .",
    "a spline is interpolated between the fits to all segments and the spectrum is rescaled by this spline .",
    "this procedure was applied to all observed spectra as well as to to one simulated spectrum per observed spectrum , where a 10 - 20% error in the continuum was introduced on scales of 1 , 4 and 16 segments .",
    "the median absolute errors remaining after blindly fitting the continua of the simulated spectra are given in table [ tbl : sample ] as an estimate of continuum fitting errors in the corresponding observed spectra .",
    "because the procedure is not fully automatic , we were unable to apply it to all of the simulated spectra .",
    "the region redwards of ly@xmath11  was fit in both simulated and observed spectra using the procedure described in  5.1 step i of paper ii .",
    "continuum fitting errors are much smaller for this region ( @xmath400.01@xmath41 ) .",
    "after continuum fitting the spectra ,  ( ly@xmath11 ) optical depths @xmath9 are derived for each pixel between the quasar s ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath23 emission wavelengths , save for regions close to the quasar to avoid proximity effects ( see  2 ) . if ly@xmath11 is saturated ( i.e. , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the flux and noise arrays , see paper i ,  4.1 ; paper ii ,  5.1 , step 2 ) , higher - order lyman lines are used to estimate @xmath9 .",
    "corresponding , , and  optical depths ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) are subsequently derived for each  pixel .",
    "we exclude regions of the quasar spectrum that are contaminated by absorption features that are not included in our simulated spectra , such as ly@xmath11  lines with damping wings . for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "corrections are made for self - contamination and contamination by other metal lines , as described in paper i ,  4.2 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oviscat ] , when plotting each percentile in @xmath45 absorption against absorption in some other ion , the correlation disappears below some optical depth @xmath48 ( corresponding to a value @xmath49 in the other ion ) that is determined by noise , continuum fitting errors , and contamination by other lines .",
    "these effects may then be corrected for by subtracting @xmath48 from the binned optical depths , thus converting most points below @xmath49 into upper limits .",
    "for each realization and for each percentile , we compute @xmath48 as the given percentile of optical depth for the set of pixels with optical depth @xmath50 .",
    "we use values @xmath51 when binning in or , and of @xmath52 when binning in , as we never see a correlation extending below these values .. for ovi the correlations are generally less strong than for civ and we fix @xmath49 `` by hand . '' ]    the error on @xmath48 for an individual realization is computed by dividing the spectrum into 5  segments , then bootstrap - resampling the spectrum by choosing these chunks with replacement , and finally computing the variance of @xmath48 as computed from 100 such resampled spectra . when the realizations are combined , @xmath53 is instead computed as the median among the realizations , and the error on this value is computed by bootstrap - resampling the realizations . for further details",
    "see paper ii ,  5.1 , step 4 and paper iii ,  3.4 .    as noted above , ly@xmath11  and higher lyman",
    "transitions heavily contaminate the  absorption regime .",
    "this can add substantial error in the recovered @xmath45 .",
    "two corrections are made to minimize this contamination .",
    "first , after recovering @xmath9 and @xmath45 , an initial correction is made for contamination by higher - order  lines by subtracting @xmath54 where _ f _ is the transition oscillator strength , @xmath55 is the redshifted lyman @xmath11 wavelength corresponding to ly@xmath56 absorption observed at wavelength @xmath57 and _ i _ corresponds to first five higher order lyman lines ( i.e. , ly@xmath23  @xmath58 through ly@xmath59 @xmath60 ) .",
    "a second correction is made by taking the minimum of the  doublet , @xmath61 where ` a ' and ` b ' denote the stronger and weaker doublet components , respectively .",
    "these corrections are described in detail in paper i ,  4.2 .",
    "another potential contamination issue is that due to strong ly@xmath11  or ly@xmath23  absorption , some higher percentiles in  absorption can become dominated by saturated pixels , so that the particular value of the percentile is determined by the contaminating lines rather than by the  distribution . to remove these unreliable percentiles from consideration ,",
    "the average noise @xmath62 is calculated for saturated  pixels and is converted into a maximum optical depth ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "after optical depths are binned , those percentile bins with @xmath64 are excluded from the analysis .      because there is substantial processing of the recovered  optical depths , it is important to test how efficiently the true  optical depths are recovered by our procedures .",
    "to do so , simulations were produced just as described in ",
    "[ sec - overview ] , but with ( effectively ) perfect resolution , no noise , and only  @xmath65 absorption ( and hence no contamination or self - contamination ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : true_rec ] the recovered  pixel optical depths are plotted against these `` true '' optical depths for a set of 60 simulated spectra , for two representative qsos ( see paper i for more such tests ) .",
    "of particular note is the efficacy of subtracting the `` flat level '' @xmath48 as described in the preceding section .",
    "ideally , @xmath48 would be determined using pixels with negligible absorption ; this is possible in the present case ( as the true optical depths are known ) and corresponding results are shown in the left panels . in a realistic case , a proxy for  must be used ; in the right panels of fig . [",
    "fig : true_rec ] ,  is employed and @xmath48 is computed using all pixels with @xmath66 . in both cases ,",
    "the subtracted @xmath48 values are shown as horizontal dashes on the right axes of fig .",
    "[ fig : true_rec ] .",
    "overall , we find that using @xmath9 to calculate @xmath67 is effective at recovering @xmath68 for the 31st and median percentiles ; for higher percentiles the recovery is accurate only at higher @xmath45 , but the large ` scatter ' indicates that this is random , rather than systematic error .      in papers i and ii",
    "it was shown from simulations that there exists a tight correlation between @xmath9 and the absorbing gas density and temperature , which could be used to predict an ionization correction ( i.e. , the ratios of /o and /h ) as a function of density ; for details see   6 in paper i and   5.1 in paper ii .",
    "as noted in papers ii and iii , this works well for  and less well for , due to their mild and strong ionization correction dependence on @xmath9 , respectively .    in the upper panel of figure [ fig : ionpred ]",
    "we provide a contour plot of the logarithm of the predicted fraction of  ions versus temperature and density .",
    "the middle and lower panels show @xmath69 for [ o / c]=0 , and @xmath70 for [ o / h]=0 , respectively .",
    "for photoionized gas ( @xmath71 ) the fraction is highest for @xmath72 , and only weakly dependent on the temperature .",
    "however , for higher densities ( and @xmath73k ) , the fraction falls quickly , resulting in a very large ionization correction for  saturated pixels . at the same time , the fraction at high density increases with @xmath74 for @xmath75k , so that collisionally ionized gas might be detected relatively easily .",
    "therefore at high @xmath9 , collisionally ionized  gas can easily swamp photoionized .",
    "this can be seen most clearly in the bottom panel , which shows that for fixed [ o / h ] and density , @xmath8 increases quickly at @xmath75k , particularly if the density is high . because our @xmath76 relation is dominated by photoionized gas ( with @xmath77 ) , the effects of collisionally ionized gas are potentially important and are discussed at length in   [ sec - collisional ] below .",
    "the strategy employed here is to employ our fiducial ionization corrections as in papers ii and iii , but to recognize that at high - density , the results may be significantly affected by collisionally ionized gas .",
    "it is important to note that the importance of collisionally ionized gas may be underestimated by our simulation , because we did not include a mechanism for generating galactic winds , which could shock - heat the gas surrounding galaxies .",
    "our simulation does , however , include heating by gravitational accretion shocks .    once the ionization correction has been determined , and corrected  optical depths and recovered  optical depths @xmath9 have been obtained , the oxygen abundance can be calculated : @xmath78   =   \\log \\left ( { \\tau_{\\rm ovi } \\over \\tau_{\\rm hi } }   { ( f\\lambda)_{\\rm hi } \\over ( f\\lambda)_{\\rm ovi } }    { n_{\\rm o } \\over n_{ovi}}{n_{\\rm hi } \\over    n_{h}}\\right ) - ( { \\rm o / h})_\\odot , \\label{eq : metallicity}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the oscillator strength and rest wavelength of transition @xmath56 , respectively ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83   , @xmath84   ) , and we use the solar abundance @xmath25 ( number density relative to hydrogen ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "an example of the results from this analysis applied to the observed spectrum of q1422 + 230 is shown in figure [ fig:1422ioncorr ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : trueinvsumm_o6 ] we show a test in which we have generated simulated spectra using the `` qg '' ionizing background , recovered optical depths , and applied the just - described ionization correction to recover the oxygen abundance .",
    "the true metallicity is given by the carbon distribution of paper ii ( for the qg background ) , with a fixed [ o / c]=@xmath85 ( i.e. , [ o / h]=-3.15 + 0.65@xmath13 ) , and is shown on the plot as a dashed line . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the abundance recovery is promising : it overestimates by less than 0.3 dex , and the dependence of @xmath13 is reproduced",
    ". however , the overestimation appears to increase for @xmath87 , reaching approximately 1 dex for the highest overdensity bin .",
    "the difference in the high- versus low-@xmath13 gas can probably be attributed to the collisionally ionized gas residing in and around dense regions , due to gravitational accretion shocks .",
    "we should thus keep in mind that we expect to overestimate the oxygen abundance associated with strong  absorbers .",
    "our basic result will be an estimate of [ o / c ] for the low - density igm as a whole , computed using four different but consistent methods , which we describe in turn .      to extract as much information as possible from our data we have , as in papers ii and iii , combined the data points obtained from our entire sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : o_c.fwd.zbin ] shows @xmath88 versus  @xmath89 , in bins of @xmath24 . to generate these points , we begin with @xmath45 values binned in @xmath47 for each qso , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : oviscat ] for q1422 + 230 .",
    "we then subtract from each the `` flat level '' @xmath48 for that qso to adjust for noise , contamination , etc .",
    "( see   [ sec - overview ] ) , then divide by the central value of the @xmath47 bin .",
    "these points , gathered from all qsos , are rebinned by determining , for each @xmath47 bin in fig .",
    "[ fig : o_c.fwd.zbin ] , the best constant - level @xmath90-fit to all of the points in the specified redshift bin .",
    "the errors represent 1- and 2-@xmath44 confidence intervals ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) on this fit .",
    "the plotted lines indicate corresponding optical depths from synthetic spectra drawn from the simulation , using several uvb models , the corresponding [ c / h ] distributions as determined in paper ii , and a constant [ o / c ] value determined as follows . for each background ,",
    "we generate simulated @xmath93 points in the same way as we did for the observations , but averaging over 50 simulated realizations as described in    [ sec - overview ] .",
    "we then calculate a @xmath90 between all valid observed original ( not rebinned ) points and the corresponding simulated points . because we use 50 simulated realizations , the simulation errors are almost always negligible compared to the observed errors , but they are still taken into account by calculating the total @xmath90 using the formula : @xmath94^{-1 } , \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 and @xmath44 is the error in this quantity .",
    "we then add a constant offset to the simulated points ( which corresponds to scaling [ o / c ] ) such that @xmath90 is minimized . in each panel",
    "the lines connect the scaled , rebinned simulation points .",
    "the first evident result is that @xmath96 and appears to be at most weakly dependent on @xmath97 , from @xmath98 to 0 .",
    "this is unlike @xmath46 , which increases by @xmath992 dex in this @xmath47 regime ( paper ii ) . at the lowest densities the data exhibits a decline . comparing these panels suggest there is little dependence on redshift in this interval",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : o_c.fwd.dbin ] , which show @xmath100 versus @xmath24 in bins of @xmath47 : there is no evidence , in either the simulated or observed points , for evolution in @xmath93 for 1.5@xmath1013.5 .",
    "the observed trends in @xmath102 are reproduced well by the simulations .",
    "therefore , because @xmath93 scales with [ o / c ] , the offset in @xmath93 obtained by minimizing the @xmath90 ( eq .  [ eq : chi2 ] ) against the observations can be used to reliably compute the best fit [ o / c ] . as an example , for our fiducial uvb model qg , the simulated spectra were generated with [ o / c]=0.65 and best fit by an offset of @xmath103dex ( implying a best - fit [ o / c]=0.66 ) , with @xmath104=42.7/82 . as we found in paper ii and for q1422 + 230 above",
    ", the reduced @xmath90 is somewhat low .",
    "this is due to a slight overestimate of the errors at low-@xmath47 ( paper ii ) and to the fact that the data points are not completely independent ( because single absorbers contribute to multiple data points ) .",
    "the fitted [ o / c ] values and corresponding @xmath105 , are listed in table  [ tbl : allfits ] , with errors computed by bootstrap - resampling the quasars used in the @xmath90 minimization . for our fiducial model , qg , the best fit [ o / c]@xmath106 .",
    "the quasar - only background q ( which is probably too hard ; see paper ii ) gives a much lower value of [ o / c]@xmath107 .",

    "[ o_h.inv.zbin ] . combining these possible sources , we estimate probable systematic errors of @xmath166dex in our basic [ o / c ] and [ o / h ] values ; this uncertainty may be somewhat greater in subsets of the data , particularly at high - density .",
    "it is important to emphasize that each quoted result is sensitive to , and applies to , only a certain range of gas densities . at the upper end , our results nominally concern gas of up to @xmath167 , though ( as noted at length above ) the high-@xmath9 range of our data is likely to be affected by collisional ionization .",
    "that range is , however , not dominant : we have checked that if all pixels with @xmath168 are excluded from the analysis , the results given for [ o / c ] in columns 2 and 4 of table  [ tbl : allfits ] change only within the quoted errors .",

    "thus our results provide indirect constraints on [ o / c ] and [ o / si ] down to @xmath175 .    however , there are important caveats .",
    "first , the quoted results pertain to the the full density range probed and thus are not necessarily very sensitive to the lowest densities .",
    "second , because the pixel method only works if the element on the x - axis is more easily detectable than the element on the y - axis , direct measurements of [ o / c ] and [ o / si ] from @xmath93 and @xmath150 are dominated by much higher - density that gives @xmath176 ; thus while these results are consistent with our indirect constraints , they do not address the ( somewhat implausible ) possibility that at low densities o , si , and c come from completely different gas phases . on the other hand , at _ high _ densities it is quite possible that ovi and siiv emission are dominated by different phases , so the indirectly inferred [ si / o ] values are probably both reliable and well - measured only in the moderate density range @xmath177 .",
    "although mass or volume filling - factors corresponding to these results are not well constrained ( see , e.g. , schaye & aguirre 2005 ) , the forewarned reader can convert the density range @xmath5 correspond to into a volume using paper ii .",
    "the best fitting metallicities and corresponding @xmath90/d.o.f .  from papers ii , iii and this work are shown in table  [ tbl : allfits ] for each uvb model .",
    "two interesting results stand out .",
    "first , for all uvb models carbon is underabundant relative to both silicon and oxygen ( being only marginally consistent with solar for uvb model q ) .",
    "second , all abundance ratios are sensitive to the uvb shape . a harder uvb results in a lower inferred [ o / c ] but a higher inferred [ si / c ] , making the [ si / o ] ratio particularly sensitive to the spectral hardness of the uvb .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the inferred [ si / o ] ratio to the spectral shape of the uv background makes it possible to constrain feasible uvb models by making only weak assumptions about the [ si / o ] ratio .",
    "since si and o are both @xmath11 elements , they are expected to trace each other relatively well .",
    "for example , using the nucleosynthetic yields of and and a @xcite initial mass function from @xmath178 , the [ si / o ] ratio of the ejecta of a population of age @xmath179  yr is predicted to be about 0.12 and -0.03 for stars of solar and 1 percent solar metallicity , respectively .",
    "this agrees well with observations of metal - poor stars , which find [ si / o]@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "tallying the results of this work with those of papers ii and iii yields [ si / o]@xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 for uvb models qg , q , and qgs , respectively .",
    "thus , our preferred model , qg , is nicely consistent with the expectations , but models q and qg lead to inferred [ si / o ] ratios that are highly inconsistent with both nucleosynthetic yields and observations of metal - poor stars .",
