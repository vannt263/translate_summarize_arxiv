    "collective bosonic modes can modify the low - energy electronic properties on the characteristic energy scale of these bosonic excitations .",
    "well understood are the significant mass enhancement@xcite and the kinks in the electronic dispersion@xcite in materials with strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "these kinks are abrupt changes of the slope of the electronic dispersion which occur at energies of the order of the debye energy which is much smaller than the fermi energy in such systems .",
    "in this paper we study kinks in the electronic dispersion which are related to emergent collective bosonic modes of the purely electronic system rather than by a coupling to external bosons such as phonons .",
    "it was shown by byczuk et al . in the framework of dynamic mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft )",
    "that such kinks are a generic feature of strongly interacting systems and require no externally coupled bosons.@xcite their argument resides on the structure of the dmft equations and the spectral density of the local propagator .",
    "our work supplements the mathematical argument in ref .   by the physical picture that",
    "the _ internally generated _ emergent collective modes provide the bosons which generate the kinks in the dispersion .",
    "this point of view has been already put forward for the half - filled case where the physical situation is particularly clear.@xcite we will show that in the model studied below these collective modes are spin fluctuations of local moments formed due to the strong local coulomb interaction . in the mott insulating phase ,",
    "stable local moments are generated which tend to form magnetically ordered phases due to residual spin - spin interactions . in the metallic phase , however , these local moments are completely screened at zero energy and the spin fluctuations at intermediate energies live only for a finite time because they decay into particle - hole pairs ( landau damping ) .",
    "we call the spin fluctuations appearing as resonances emergent modes because they become long - lived for even larger interaction in the insulating phase .",
    "photoemission experiments support our view in antiferromagnetic@xcite and in ferromagnetic systems.@xcite    as will be shown , there exist two conditions for the kinks to appear in the dispersion relation .",
    "for one , strong emergent collective modes ( spin fluctuations ) must be present in the system .",
    "this is signaled by a pronounced maximum in the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility at a finite energy @xmath0 .",
    "for another , the energy scale for charge excitations @xmath1 must be much larger than the characteristic spin - excitation energy , i.e.   @xmath2 . here",
    ", the energy scale for charge excitations is set either by a single - particle energy or the characteristic scale for collective charge excitations , depending on which is smaller .",
    "both criteria are met in strongly correlated metallic systems close to a mott - insulator transition .",
    "the term `` collective bosonic modes '' in solid - state systems usually refers to dispersive , i.e. , wave - vector dependent , excitations such as ( para-)magnons or charge density waves .",
    "such modes are characterized by the momentum dependent spin- and charge - susceptibilities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it may be put forward that in dmft no true collective modes exist because they do not propagate properly .",
    "indeed , in the strict limit of infinite dimensions collective two - particle properties are local because they are momentum - independent except for some momenta of measure zero .",
    "@xcite yet we do not adopt this puristic view and stick to the wording of collective bosonic modes for three reasons .",
    "first , spin- and charge fluctuations are two - particle properties and as such comprise at least two elementary fermionic excitations so that they are collective and bosonic in this sense .",
    "second , even in the strict dmft , the spin- and charge - susceptibilities are true lattice quantities involving all lattice sites .",
    "otherwise , their imaginary parts would show only one or two @xmath5 peaks instead of broad continua , see for instance ref .  .",
    "third , generically the dmft is taken as an approximation to finite dimensional systems .",
    "then , the susceptibilities acquire a non - trivial @xmath6-dependence through the inner momentum and frequency sums in the bethe - salpeter equations , even though the irreducible two - particle vertex is assumed to be local . @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extract the characteristic energy scales relevant for the dispersive collective modes from the local susceptibilities @xmath7 because they readily reflect these energy scales and can be obtained in dmft from the effective impurity model .",
    "we investigate the low - temperature phase of the hubbard model away from half filling using the dmft with three different impurity solvers in order to be able to clearly separate physical features from possible algorithmic artifacts .",
    "we employ two numerical renormalization schemes , namely the density - matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) and numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) as well as a diagrammatic approach , the so - called enhanced non - crossing approximation ( enca).@xcite the results of all three algorithms agree very well .",
    "the remaining differences can be understood on the basis of the known strengths and weaknesses of the approaches .",
    "the prevailing effect of the interaction is a significant renormalization of the bare electron mass due to correlations .",
    "the fermi liquid theory@xcite connects this mass renormalization to a fundamental energy scale @xmath8 below which the fermi liquid picture of renormalized weakly interacting , long - lived quasiparticles applies . in strongly correlated electron systems",
    "the properties of these renormalized quasiparticles may differ dramatically from those of non - interacting electrons as exemplified in heavy fermion systems.@xcite    the article is laid out as follows . the model and the relevant theoretical background",
    "are described sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",

    "[ sec : low - energy - scale ] .",
    "we will explicitly show that @xmath8 also occurs as energy scale in the dynamic spin susceptibility but not in the local charge susceptibility .",

    "@xcite when applied in finite dimensions , the major approximation of dmft consists in treating all non - local correlations in a mean - field manner while the correlated local dynamics is faithfully retained .",

    ".    then , the local green function of the lattice problem reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath23 the bare dispersion .",
    "this local lattice propagator equals the local green function of an effective single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xmath24 embedded in a medium characterized by the hybridization function @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the embedding medium is a dynamic medium and it is not independent from the solution of the siam , but it has to be determined self - consistently as in any generic mean - field approach .    for a given guess for the hybridization function the local green function is determined by a suitable numerical algorithm which is commonly referred to as the employed ` impurity solver ' .",

    "a multitude of different impurity solvers for treating this model exists such as iterative perturbation theory,@xcite exact diagonalization@xcite or several variations of quantum monte - carlo schemes.@xcite in this work , we employ the enhanced non - crossing approximation , the numerical renormalization group , and the dynamic density - matrix renormalization group as impurity solvers and compare their results .",

    "while magnetic properties , i.e. , the magnetic susceptibility , are described excellently , charge fluctuations are not as well accounted for.@xcite in the spectral functions , where spin and charge fluctuations contribute equally , this leads to an overestimation of the height of the many - body resonance at the fermi level at too low temperatures .",
    "the dynamic charge susceptibility is overestimated for very low frequencies .",
