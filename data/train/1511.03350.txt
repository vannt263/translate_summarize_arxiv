    "energy harvesting is a promising approach for realizing self - powered wireless networks .",
    "a wireless device equipped with energy harvesting capability may extract energy from natural or man - made sources such as solar radiations , wind , radio frequency ( rf ) signals , indoor lighting , etc .",
    "@xcite . energy harvesting could potentially transform both infrastructure - based as well as ad hoc wireless networks .",
    "for instance , in cellular systems , energy harvesting could help reduce the operating expenditures for the cell - sites , reduce the carbon footprint as well as facilitate cell - site deployment @xcite .",
    "similarly , energy harvesting is also closely related to the internet of things @xcite , which broadly is a network consisting of everyday objects such as machines , buildings , vehicles , etc .",
    "many of these _ smart _ objects will contain low - power wireless sensors that communicate with other devices and/or a cloud / control unit .",
    "energy harvesting can potentially enhance the battery lifetimes while simplifying the network maintenance ( for instance , with an energy harvesting device , no human intervention would be needed for battery replacement ) , thus providing the much - needed autonomy for sustaining such networks@xcite .",
    "energy harvesting devices need new communication protocols . due to limited energy storage capacity and depending on the type of harvesting ,",
    "the energy availability at the device varies over time .",
    "this leads to a model where energy arrivals are bursty .",
    "several papers have proposed optimal transmission policies assuming causal or non - causal knowledge about energy arrivals for different setups ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "for example , a point - point link @xcite , an interference channel @xcite , and a broadcast channel @xcite have been considered .",
    "while prior research has mostly considered simple information - theoretic setups , some recent studies have investigated the network - level dynamics in large _ non - cooperative _ wireless networks powered by energy harvesting @xcite .",
    "stochastic geometry is emerging as a popular tool for analyzing a variety of setups ranging from ad hoc , to cognitive and cellular networks .",
    "it often leads to tractable analytical models that yield general performance insights , thus obviating the need of exhaustive simulations @xcite .",
    "the performance of ad hoc networks was characterized using metrics such as outage probability and transmission capacity @xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been applied to single and multi - tier cellular networks under different assumptions about cell association , scheduling and power control @xcite .",
    "multi - cell cooperation has been analyzed for different cooperation models in @xcite .",
    "for example , dynamic coordinated beamforming was treated in @xcite , random clustering with intercell interference nulling was considered in @xcite , and pairwise cooperation with limited channel knowledge was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "similarly , joint transmission without prior channel knowledge and/or tight synchronization has also been considered @xcite .",
    "none of the aforementioned work@xcite on _ cooperative _ networks , however , considers energy harvesting .",
    "stochastic geometry has been used to analyze energy harvesting systems .",
    "large - scale self - powered ad hoc networks have been analyzed in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the network model consists of a large number of energy harvesting transmitters , where each transmitter has a dedicated receiver located a fixed distance away .",
    "leveraging tools from stochastic geometry and random walk theory , spatial throughput was derived by optimizing over the transmission power .",
    "for a similar setup , the authors in @xcite derived the transmission capacity for a random access network by optimizing over the medium access probability .",
    "self - powered heterogeneous cellular networks have been considered in @xcite . in @xcite , base - station availability ( i.e. , the fraction of the time it can remain on ) was analytically characterized using tools from random walk theory and stochastic geometry .",
    "the work in @xcite and @xcite , however , does not consider any node cooperation or joint transmission at the physical layer .",
    "cooperative / joint transmission seems particularly attractive for energy harvesting networks , as it could compensate for the performance loss due to uncertain energy availability at the transmitters .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a large - scale network of transmitters and receivers , where a receiver node is jointly served by a cluster consisting of its @xmath0 closest self - powered transmitter nodes .",
    "this model is attractive for many scenarios involving energy harvesting wireless communications such as self - powered sensor networks , self - powered wireless hotspots , and other iot - inspired applications of the future@xcite .",
    "we provide a tractable framework to characterize the system performance as a function of key parameters such as the cluster size , the energy harvesting capability , the transmitter / receiver densities and other network and channel parameters .",
    "we model the locations of the transmitters and receivers using independent poisson point processes ( ppps ) .",
    "to reap the benefits of cooperation , the transmitters are grouped into clusters such that all the in - cluster transmitters jointly serve a common receiver , which is subjected to interference from the out - of - cluster nodes .",
    "channel acquisition and node coordination , which is formidable even for conventional networks , is typically exacerbated with energy harvesting nodes .",
    "this motivates us to adopt non - coherent joint transmission as the cooperation model .",
    "the performance of such a _ cooperative _ self - powered wireless network in a stochastic geometry framework has not been analyzed in the literature .",
    "the proposed analytical model captures the key interplay between the cluster size and the transmitter and receiver densities .",
    "note that a transmitter cluster may have multiple candidate receivers , only one of which will be served in a given resource .",
    "we therefore consider a performance metric that captures the two key events influencing the overall performance : ( i ) a receiver is selected for service ( modeled via cluster access probability in section [ secclus ] ) , and ( ii ) the transmission is successful ( modeled via link success probability in section [ seclink ] ) .",
    "for the former , we propose an analytical approximation for the cluster access probability in terms of the cluster size and the ratio of the transmitter and receiver densities .",
    "for the latter , we derive simple analytical expressions that characterize the link performance as a function of system parameters ( e.g. , energy harvesting rate , energy buffer size , transmitter density ) , channel parameters and cluster geometry , while accounting for the heterogeneous network interference . leveraging these results ( each being a novel contribution in itself )",
    ", a closed - form analytical expression is derived for the overall performance metric , and validated using simulations .",
    "we also investigate the impact of cluster size , energy harvesting rate and energy buffer size on the overall performance .",
    "our findings suggest that ( i ) there is an optimal cluster size that maximizes the overall performance given the density parameters ; ( ii ) the optimal cluster size increases with the ratio of transmitter and receiver densities and typically ranges from 1 to 3 ; ( iii ) a relatively small energy buffer size ( typically large enough to store 10 or fewer transmissions in the considered setup ) is sufficient for extracting performance gains ; and ( iv ) the utility of having a large energy buffer increases with the energy harvesting rate as well as with the cluster size when the density ratio is sufficiently large . our analytical model is applicable to a general class of networks , with the traditionally - powered cooperative and non - cooperative networks as special cases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is described in section [ secsys ] . using tools from stochastic geometry ,",
    "the analytical expressions for the considered performance metrics are derived in section [ secstoch ] .",
    "section [ secsim ] presents the simulation results and section [ secconclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we now describe the energy harvesting model , the underlying assumptions about the considered network , and the cooperation scenario .",
    "we consider a large wireless network consisting of transmitters that are equipped with energy harvesting modules ( e.g. , rf energy harvesting ) .",
    "the energy arrivals are assumed to be random and independent across nodes .",
    "none of the transmitters are privy to any non - causal information about energy arrivals .",
    "we now describe the energy harvesting model for an arbitrary transmitter equipped with an energy buffer of size @xmath1 .",
    "the energy arrives at the buffer with rate @xmath2 following an independent and identically distributed ( iid ) bernoulli process , i.e. , with probability @xmath2 , one unit of energy arrives at the buffer in time - slot @xmath3 , while @xmath4 is the probability that no energy arrives at the buffer in that slot .",
    "a node may choose to transmit with fixed power @xmath5 if it has sufficient energy in the buffer .",
    "no power control is assumed , therefore each transmission depletes the buffer of @xmath5 units of energy .",
    "the energy arrivals are modeled using a birth - death markov process along the lines of @xcite . for medium access ,",
    "we consider a slotted aloha based random access protocol where in each time - slot , a node ( having sufficient energy ) accesses the medium with probability @xmath6 independently of other nodes .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the probability that a node has the requisite amount of energy available in the buffer of size @xmath8 .",
    "then , @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 denotes the state ( i.e. , energy level ) of the buffer at time @xmath3 .",
    "we now define @xmath11 , the transmission probability of an arbitrary node , and express it as a function of system parameters .",
    "[ lem1 ] for energy arrivals with rate @xmath12 , finite energy buffer of size @xmath1 , and channel access probability @xmath13 , it follows that @xmath14 in steady state , where @xmath15 for the case @xmath16 .",
    "it can be proved by solving the balance equations for the resulting markov chain ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath17 since @xmath18 , where @xmath19 corresponds to the case when the node is powered by conventional power sources .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 is fixed throughout the network .",
    "therefore , the transmission probability of a node varies as a function of the energy harvesting rate and buffer size . in other words ,",
    "the higher the @xmath11 of a node , the more superior the energy harvesting capability ( i.e. , harvesting rate and/or buffer size ) .",
    "note that lemma 1 has been specialized for the case @xmath16 for simplicity .",
    "for other values of @xmath5 , it is possible to solve the balance equations of the corresponding markov chain to calculate @xmath7 .      in our setup , a cluster of @xmath0 ( self - powered ) cooperating transmitters ( txs ) jointly serve a desired receiver ( rx ) or user over the same time - frequency resource block .",
    "we assume that each user is served by the @xmath0 closest txs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : netmodel ] ) .",
    "the tx locations are drawn from a homogeneous ppp of intensity ( density ) @xmath20 , which we denote as @xmath21 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath22 as the tx tier .",
    "similarly , the user locations are modeled using another ppp @xmath23 of intensity @xmath24 , which is assumed to be independent of @xmath22 . when there are multiple candidate users seeking a given tx cluster , we assume that a user is selected uniformly at random for service each time - slot ( see section [ secclus ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the txs in @xmath22 are active with a transmission probability @xmath25 ( lemma [ lem1 ] , section [ seceh ] ) .",
    "for example , when a tx has no candidate user in @xmath23 ( i.e. , void cell ) , it may still transmit to ( wirelessly ) charge other inactive users , or to serve other opportunistic users in the network ( performance characterization of such users , though , is not the focus of this work ) .",
    "consider an arbitrary user in @xmath23 being jointly served by its @xmath0 closest txs in @xmath22 .",
    "due to concurrent transmissions , it is subjected to co - channel interference from the out - of - cluster nodes . in general , we expect such a network to consist of nodes with different physical parameters ( e.g. , energy harvesting capability ) and random locations ( e.g. , due to unplanned deployments ) . to model this heterogeneous network interference , we consider @xmath26 additional tiers of nodes , where the nodes in tier @xmath27 are located according to a homogeneous ppp @xmath28 of intensity @xmath29 , independently of other tiers . for compactness , we also introduce an alternative notation for the nodes in tx tier @xmath22 .",
    "specifically , the subscript 0 is used while referring to the quantities of nodes in the tx tier when confusion might arise , e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . note that each class of nodes may differ in terms of energy harvesting rate @xmath32 , energy buffer size @xmath33 ,",
    "transmit power @xmath34 , and intensity @xmath29 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume the transmit power of the tx tier to be normalized to unity .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 also corresponds to the normalized transmit power of tier @xmath27 , where the normalization is done with respect to the actual transmit power of the tx tier .",
    "all the nodes are assumed to be equipped with single antennas .",
    "all the nodes are assumed to employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) for communication .",
    "we consider a transmission scheme where a group of @xmath0 cooperating txs jointly transmit the same data to a given user over the same time - frequency resource block . given the challenges associated with channel acquisition , none of the transmitting nodes are assumed to have any instantaneous channel knowledge .",
    "the considered joint transmission scheme is simple as it does not require joint encoding at the cooperating transmitters . to further reduce the coordination overhead",
    ", we do not assume any tight synchronization among the in - cluster txs .",
    "the user , however , is required to know the composite downlink channel from the in - cluster transmitters for coherent detection .",
    "the signals transmitted by the cooperating txs superimpose non - coherently at the receiver , resulting in a received power boost .",
    "moreover , interference seen by the user is treated as noise for the purpose of decoding .",
    "we now describe the channel model .",
    "let @xmath35 be the channel power gain for the link from a tx @xmath36 in @xmath22 to the given user .",
    "we consider a rich scattering environment where all the links experience iid narrowband rayleigh fading such that the small - scale fading power is exponentially distributed , i.e. , @xmath37.17ex@xmath38 .",
    "leveraging slivnyak s theorem @xcite , we consider a typical user located at the origin , and characterize the performance in the presence of co - channel interference and noise .",
    "note that the timing offset between cooperating transmitters causes the received signal power to vary substantially across a large number of subcarriers within the coherence bandwidth ( particularly when the timing offset and coherence bandwidth are assumed to be relatively large ) .",
    "therefore , we can consider the average received power across these subcarriers for analysis ( along the lines of @xcite ) .",
    "with such a non - coherent joint transmission scheme ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) for details ) , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the user can be expressed as @xmath39 where the bernoulli random variable @xmath40 models the uncertainty due to bursty energy arrivals at the transmitter such that @xmath41=p_{\\text{tr},i}$ ] and @xmath42=1-p_{\\text{tr},i}\\triangleq q_{\\text{tr},i}$ ] for the in - cluster txs ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 denotes the pathloss exponent , while @xmath45 gives the variance of the receiver noise , which we assume to be zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 denotes the aggregate interference power observed at the receiver . for analytical tractability",
    ", it is assumed that the signals transmitted by the interfering nodes superimpose non - coherently at the receiver , which would typically be the case .",
    "the aggregate interference power @xmath46 can be expressed as where the first term @xmath47 accounts for the in - network or intrinsic interference due to the out - of - cluster txs in @xmath22 . here ,",

    "note that for the interfering tiers , we use a slightly modified notation by including @xmath51 in the subscript to denote a node @xmath36 that belongs to the interfering tier @xmath52 . as done for the tx tier @xmath22",
    ", we can similarly define @xmath53=p_{\\text{tr}}^{(m)}$ ] for the nodes in tier @xmath27 .",

    "similarly , the multi - tier approach allows capturing the heterogeneity in out - of - cluster nodes .",
    "furthermore , all the interfering txs can be assumed to have the maximum harvesting rate / buffer size to get a lower bound on performance .    _",

    "this observation also holds for theorem 2 .",
    "theorem 1 is general in that it is applicable to any given absolute cluster geometry .",

    "we next study how the energy harvesting parameters limit the outage performance .",
    "we first consider how outage probability varies as a function of energy buffer size . to get general performance insights",
    ", we use the asymptotic outage probability @xmath208 , which defines an upper limit on performance given the energy harvesting parameters and cluster size . note that similar insights can be obtained if the analysis is particularized for a given outage threshold @xmath143 using ( [ d3 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] , the asymptotic outage probability @xmath209 is plotted against the energy buffer size @xmath8 ( in log scale ) for various values of the cluster size @xmath0 .",
    "we see that outage can be considerably reduced by increasing the buffer size until a limit , beyond which the curves tend to flatten out .",
    "the existence of this outage probability floor follows from corollary 5 , and the floor value is specified by ( [ floor1 ] ) .",
    "it appears that appreciable performance gains can be extracted with a relatively small buffer size .",
    "moreover , the benefits of having a high - capacity energy buffer tend to increase with the cluster size as depicted by the increasing steepness of the slopes ( when @xmath8 is small ) as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this interplay between cluster and buffer size also suggests that the extent of cooperation could influence the design of energy harvesting devices , even though the energy harvesting process is assumed to be independent across the cooperating txs .",
    "in addition , we observe that the outage is reduced by roughly an order of magnitude with every addition in the cluster size .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : d ] , the asymptotic outage probability @xmath209 is plotted against the energy harvesting rate @xmath2 for various values of energy buffer size @xmath8 .",

    "[ fig : d ] also corroborates the previous observation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : c ] ) that substantial performance can be extracted by using a relatively small buffer size .",

    "third , the overall performance improves with the buffer size and the energy harvesting rate .",

    "<S> a large - scale wireless network with energy harvesting transmitters is considered , where a group of transmitters forms a cluster to cooperatively serve a desired receiver amid interference and noise . to characterize the link - level performance , </S>",
    "<S> closed - form expressions are derived for the transmission success probability at a receiver in terms of key parameters such as node densities , energy harvesting parameters , channel parameters , and cluster size , for a given cluster geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is further extended to characterize a network - level performance metric , capturing the tradeoff between link quality and the fraction of receivers served . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the analytical model . </S>",
    "<S> several useful insights are provided . </S>",
    "<S> for example , while more cooperation helps improve the link - level performance , the network - level performance might degrade with the cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that a small cluster size ( typically 3 or smaller ) optimizes the network - level performance . furthermore , substantial performance can be extracted with a relatively small energy buffer . moreover , the utility of having a large energy buffer increases with the energy harvesting rate as well as with the cluster size in sufficiently dense networks .    </S>",
