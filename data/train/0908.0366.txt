    "@xcite within one - electron theory , @xcite photoinduced charge transfer ( pict ) , which lies at the heart of organic photovoltaics , involves the photoexcitation of either the donor ( d ) pcp or the acceptor ( a ) fullerene , followed by a single - step electron ( hole ) transfer from the lowest antibonding ( highest bonding ) molecular orbital ( mo ) of the optically excited d ( a ) to the lowest available mo of a ( d ) .",
    "recent research by many groups have , however , detected an interfacial excited - state charge transfer complex ( hereafter exciplex ) below the optical gaps of both d and a upon photoexcitation .",

    "we present here a many - electron theory of pict between derivatives of poly - paraphenylenevinylene ( ppv ) and c@xmath1 , focusing on the nature of the exciplex wave function , the difference between ground- and excited - state charge transfers and the photophysics of the exciplex .",
    "one goal of our work is to give consistent explanations of perplexing experiments in pcp - fullerene da blends .",
    "a second broader goal is to show that there exists a universality in the photophsyics of films of single - component pcps ( refs .",
    "28 and 29 ) with no identifiable donor and acceptor constituents on the one hand , and blends on the other . as in the blends , there occurs an interfacial excited - state charge transfer complex below the strong optically allowed state also in the single - component systems .",

    "differences in the photophysics of the two different kinds of intermolecular species can be rationalized within this context .    the bulk of the experimental works in blends have been limited to investigations of radiative and nonradiative couplings between the exciplex and the ground state , focusing on absorption , photoluminescence ( pl ) and electroluminescence ( el ) . in general ,",
    "these studies indicate the occurrence of the exciplex below the optical states of both components , with weak radiative coupling to the ground state , but do not usually give the degree of charge transfer , hereafter ionicity , of the exciplex",

    "@xcite much additional information is , however , obtained from ultrafast spectroscopy that detects photoinduced absorptions ( pa ) .",
    "ultrafast spectroscopy of films of single - component pcps , for example , had early on found evidence for interchain species , @xcite the nature of which has been of continuing interest.@xcite remarkable advance in ultrafast spectroscopy of single - component pcps was achieved recently by sheng _ et al .",
    "_ , who extended the pa studies to the previously inaccessible mid infrared region , and in addition to the pa expected from the exciton ( labeled pa@xmath2 by the authors ) found pa bands p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 at energies where charged polarons are expected to absorb .",

    "this apparent contradiction has been resolved in theoretical work that has shown that the pa in films of single - component pcps originates from both the optical exciton and a bound charge transfer exciton ( ctx ) that occurs below the exciton .",
    "@xcite the ctx is a quantum - mechanical superposition of the intrachain exciton and the interchain coulombically bound polaron pair , and exhibits picosecond ( ps ) pa at energies characteristic of both the neutral exciton and charged polarons . @xcite the absence of irav is due to the _ symmetric _ nature of the polaron - pair contribution to the ctx , with the probability of either chain being charged positively or negatively being exactly equal .",

    "@xcite recall , for example , that pa at energy nearly the same as pa@xmath2 occurs from the ctx in single - component systems .",
    "@xcite in the following , we arrive at consistent explanations of the above apparently contradictory experimental observations , from calculations within the same theoretical model that was previously used for meh - ppv films alone .",

    "we also explain the absence of the pa@xmath2 band following below - gap excitation and give a plausible explanation for the rapid decay of the same upon above - gap excitation .",
    "we extend our previous pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) calculations @xcite to an idealized 1:1 ppv - c@xmath1 blend , which we approximate by a planar capped ppv oligomer 8 units long , and a c@xmath1 molecule whose nearest carbon atoms are located 0.4 nm below the plane of the ppv .",
    "we have considered three different geometries , with ( i ) a pentagonal face of the c@xmath1 molecule parallel to the ppv plane and located symmetrically below the central ethylenic bond ( see fig.[blend ] , geometry i ) , ( ii ) the same pentagonal face now positioned below and parallel to a phenyl ring in the ppv oligomer ( see fig.[blend ] , geometry ii ) , and ( iii ) a symmetric configuration with the ethylenic bond in the center of the 8-unit ppv occurring above the bond common to two hexagons in the c@xmath1 molecule ( see fig.[blend ] , geometry iii ) .",
    "the parallel orientation of a face or bond of c@xmath1 with the plane of ppv is necessary to obtain the significant intermolecular charge transfer that is implied by experiments , viz . , emission from the exciplex @xcite and pa even upon below - gap excitation .",
    "@xcite the three geometrical arrangements chosen , however , give large variations in intermolecular coulomb interactions and electron hoppings ( see below ) .",

    "taken together , the large @xmath44 and the degeneracies indicate that higher - order ci can be performed here only by imposing severe cutoffs in the number of excited configurations that are retained , which in turn would lead to strong loss of precision in our computational results .",

    "as suggested from experiments ( see above ) , a larger @xmath48 , and therefore smaller @xmath49 become necessary . with geometries ii and iii , this is achieved with @xmath64 , only slightly different from the @xmath51 needed with geometry i. as seen in fig.[geom - comparison ] , the energy locations of the pa bands from the exciton and the exciplex are very weakly affected by the geometry change . the effect on the intensities of the absorptions ,",
    "in particular , the absorptions from the exciton , is stronger .",
    "this is to be expected from the large intermolecular hoppings in geometries ii and iii .",
    "we have already presented the implications of our results for ground state absorption and pl in the previous section .",
    "our determination that the lowest exciplex in ppv - c@xmath1 is nearly completely ionic agrees with the conclusion of osikowicz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite our conclusion that there occur multiple exciplexes in ppv - c@xmath1 agrees with the conclusion of drori _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite our interpretations of the transient absorptions that result from above- and below - gap excitations @xcite are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "the figure is not arrived at from the theoretical calculations alone as the rates of various intermediate nonradiative processes indicated in the figure can not be obtained theoretically .",
    "our conclusions are rather reached by combining arguments that follow from experiments as well as the calculations reported in the previous section .",
    "the high pump energy ( 3.1 ev ) of the above - gap excitation @xcite can take the system to the continuum band of ppv , @xcite albeit with small cross - section , generating some mobile polarons directly .",
    "in addition , absorption can also occur to the lowest c@xmath9 states , which are at this energy and are weakly dipole coupled to the ground state ( strong molecular absorptions in c@xmath1 occur at much higher energy ) . in either case",
    ", there is rapid nonradiative decay to the lower - energy ppv@xmath7c@xmath1 exciton and the exciplex .",
    "the rate of this ultrafast decay can not be estimated theoretically but it is easily seen from considerations of energy that no other explanation of the experiments is possible . recall that all three pa bands p@xmath2 , pa@xmath2 , and p@xmath3 are seen at zero time delay . @xcite the pa band pa@xmath2 has previously been seen in solutions as well as films of pure ppv derivatives @xcite and has also been theoretically analyzed as the excitation from the ppv optical exciton to the ma@xmath62 .",
    "@xcite we have not found any pa at this energy from ppvc@xmath9 or ppvc@xmath8 states . considering all of the above pa@xmath2",
    "can only be an excitation from the ppv@xmath7c@xmath1 exciton .",
    "in contrast , pa bands p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 are never seen in solutions , and hence can not involve excitations from the neutral ppv chain . as mentioned above ,",
    "we see complete absence of pas from the c@xmath14 component of the exciplex .",
    "the only possibilities are then that these are free polaron absorptions or absorptions from the ppv@xmath13 component of the exciplex state .",
    "the similarities in the p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 bands obtained from above - gap and below - gap excitations , observed experimentally , show that these are absorptions from the exciplex .",
    "the absence of the pa@xmath2 band in the above - gap pa at later times @xcite is therefore an unambiguous signature that pa now is from the exciplex alone , which , as seen in figs .  5 ,",
    "does not absorb at energy pa@xmath2 .",
    "pa resulting from below - gap excitation is also from the same exciplex .",
    "we have already pointed out that the scaled calculated energy of the exciplex is close to that determined by drori _",
    "_ @xcite as in the case of single - component pcps , pa bands p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 originate from a bound state .",
    "this explains the immobility of the `` polarons '' noted by drori _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite especially upon below - gap excitation .",
    "the irav accompanying the pas p@xmath2 and p@xmath3 is due to the asymmetric nature of the exciplex wave function . unlike in the ctx in pure meh - ppv",
    ", the ppv molecule in the exciplex has a definite charge ( positive ) and the coupling between the electronic and vibrational modes is nearly the same as in an isolated chain with a localized defect . while it is not clear whether the charge transfer pa - located energetically between p@xmath2 and pa@xmath2 is seen experimentally in the blend of meh - ppv and c@xmath1 , @xcite we point out that holt _",
    "claim to have observed precisely this absorption in a blend of meh - ppv and acceptor 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone ( tnf ) ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "tnf is a stronger acceptor than c@xmath1 , and hence leads to even larger homo - lumo offsets than in ppv - c@xmath1 .",
    "larger offsets in turn enhance the ct energy further , thereby probably leading to a larger splitting between p@xmath2 and ct , which is necessary to observe a distinct ct band in pa .        in summary , ground state optical absorptions , as well as ps pas in blends of ppv derivatives and fullerenes can be understood within the standard ppp model , with the intermolecular dielectric screening @xmath49 as an adjustable variable .",
    "pa experiments find complete absence of the pa@xmath2 band upon below - gap excitation , indicating nearly completely ionic character of the lowest exciplex .",
    "we find nearly completely ionic lowest exciplex for many different relative orientations between the ppv and c@xmath1 molecules , varying @xmath49 very slightly .",
    "the relative orientations of the ppv oligomer and c@xmath1 have minor consequences on the overall energy locations of the pa bands .",
    "we emphasize that in contradiction to some recent proposals , the photophysics of the blend can not be understood in the context of ground - state charge transfer .",
    "mulliken s original theory of ground state charge transfer @xcite assumed that the intramolecular excitations are very high in energy and the donor - acceptor complex can be described using only two basis functions , neutral da and ionic d@xmath13a@xmath65 .",
    "this two - state approximation breaks down when either or both the optical excitations d@xmath7a and da@xmath7 are close in energy to d@xmath13a@xmath65 , as is true in complexes involving pcps .",
    "the ctx in pure pcps and the exciplex in blends both arise predominantly from excited - state charge transfer , involving d@xmath13a@xmath65 and the intramolecular excitations .",
    "the key difference between the ctx and the exciplex is that the former is predominantly neutral and the latter is ionic .",
    "we have found in both single - component systems and blends a charge transfer pa distinct from p@xmath2 and pa@xmath2 . whether this pa will be seen in systems other than meh - ppv :",
    "tnf is of interest . also of interest",
    "are the high - energy exciplex states of fig.[eng - spctrm](a ) with lower ionicities and hence stronger electronic couplings with the optical exciton in the pcp .",
    "these are also expected to be electronically coupled to extended states involving more distant molecules in a multilayer system .",
    "@xcite we are currently investigating model multilayer systems theoretically .     and pa@xmath66 bands , calculated using sci and qci.,width=316 ]",
    "we are grateful to a. shukla and z. wang for help with computations , and to z. v. vardeny and l. j. rothberg for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf under grant no .",
    "we report here sci and qci calculations of pa for an artificial da complex consisting of a pair of ppv3 oligomers , one of which can act as a donor in the excited - state , while the other behaves as an acceptor .",
    "we achieve this by adding a term @xmath67 to @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ h_intra ] .",
    "we assume a perfectly stacked cofacial dimer , as in our earlier work for single - component systems , @xcite and limit @xmath47 = 0.1 ev to nearest interchain neighbors ( note that the difference between sci and qci arises from the coulomb interactions alone and @xmath47 plays a weak role ) . as with the ppv - c@xmath1 calculations with geometry i , we choose an intermolecular distance of 0.4 nm and @xmath51 . with the total number of carbon atoms @xmath68 ,",
    "qci is feasible ; the dimension of the qci hamiltonian matrix is 1833276 . with @xmath690.185",
    "ev the energy offset between the hartree - fock homo levels is 0.37 ev , equal to the offset between the homos of ppv and c@xmath1 in fig.[hfmo ] . with these parameter sets ,",
    "the correlated energy spectrum near the optical edge is very similar to that in ppv - c@xmath1 : the lowest excited - state is the exciplex with ionicities of 0.95 with sci and 0.93 with qci , and the optical exciton is 0.88 ev above the exciplex . meaningful comparisons of pa calculations for the two cases can therefore be done .    in fig.[appdx1 ] , we show the calculated pa bands from the exciplex and exciton , using both sci and qci .",
    "the final states of pa bands labeled p@xmath2 from the exciplex have ionicities 0.91 and 0.80 , within sci and qci , respectively .",
    "thus both the initial and final states here are predominantly ionic .",
    "the pa bands from the exciton , pa@xmath66 , in contrast , have final - state ionicities of 0 and 0.28 within sci and qci , respectively .",
    "as expected the initial and final states here are predominantly covalent .",
    "as seen in fig.[appdx1 ] , p@xmath66 and pa@xmath66 bands within sci occur at energies @xmath6 1.12 and 0.74 ev , respectively .",
    "their proximity is similar to that in ppv - c@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ pa - absorption](a ) , with the slightly higher energy of p@xmath2 here ascribed to the large intraband gaps in the short ppv3 oligomer . as fig.[appdx1 ] also shows , the energies of the pa bands originating from the exciplex show relatively modest shifts between sci and qci .",
    "in contrast , pa originating from the exciton is affected very strongly . thus while p@xmath66 red - shifts weakly from 1.12 to 1.01 ev , pa@xmath66 displays an enormous blue - shift from 0.74 to 1.73 ev , such that it now appears considerably above p@xmath66 .",
    "as claimed in sec.[sec : results ] , these results are actually to be anticipated from earlier calculations on the nature of the ma@xmath62 two - photon state , and provide the justification for our rigidly blue - shifting the calculated pa@xmath66 band of ppv - c@xmath1 in fig.[pa - absorption](b ) while leaving the energy location of p@xmath66 intact .",
