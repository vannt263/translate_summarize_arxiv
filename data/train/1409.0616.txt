    "the gapless energy spectrum of graphene  @xcite enables using single- or multiple graphene - layer ( gl ) structures for different terahertz ( thz ) and infrared ( ir ) photodetectors based on involving the interband transitions  @xcite ( see , also   refs  @xcite ) , where different thz and ir photodetectors based on gls were explored ) .",
    "the interband photodetectors use either the gls serving as photoconductors or the lateral p - i - n junctions . in the latter case , the electrons and holes are generated in the depleted i - region and move to the opposite gl contacts driven by the electric field in the depletion region  @xcite .",
    "the multiple - gl structures with the lateral p - i - n junctions can consist of either several non - bernal stacked twisted ) gls as in ref .",

    "such heterostructures have recently attracted a considerable interest and enabled several novel devices being proposed and realized  @xcite .",
    "the gl - photodetectors , especially those based on the multiple - gl structures , can combine a high responsivity with a relatively low dark current at elevated temperatures ( up to room temperatures ) .",
    "this is because the dark current in the photodetectors in question is mainly determined by the absorption of the optical phonons .",
    "since the optical phonon energy @xmath3 in gls is rather large ( about 0.2  ev ) , the number of optical phonons is small even at the room temperature .",
    "this results in a low thermal generation rate .",
    "the mechanisms of the thermal generation associated with the absorption of the acoustic phonons and the auger processes are forbidden due to the features of the gl energy spectrum .",
    "however , the interband tunneling in strong lateral electric fields in the i - region can lead to an enhanced generation of the electron - hole pairs and an elevated dark current limiting the photodetector detectivity  @xcite .",
    "effective thz detection can be achieved in the lateral diodes with the absorbing gl source and drain sections separated by an array of grapnene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , which form the potential barriers for hot electrons injected from the source to the drain  @xcite .",
    "as shown in this paper , an effective thz detection can be achieved in the photodetectors based on double - gl and cascade multiple - gl structures with the vertical transport of hot electrons over the barrier layers .",
    "we propose and evaluate such thz detectors operating in the regime of the thermionic emission of hot electrons from gls and their vertical transport over the barrier layers .",
    "the advantages of the thz detectors under consideration include high responsivity and detectivity in a wide spectral range at room temperature and a relatively high - speed operation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the device structures under consideration and the gld operation principle . section iii deals with general formulas for the dark current and photocurrent associated with the thermionic emission of electrons from gl and controlled by their capture into gls . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the variations of the electron temperature in gls cause by the intraband ( drude ) absorption of the incident thz radiation . in sections",

    "the double - glds consist of only the top and bottom gls serving as the emitter and collector , respectively ( no inner gls ) . in the multiple - glds , the inner gls clad by the emitter and collector gls are disconnected from the contacts . in the double - glds ( with a single barrier ) ,",
    "the bias voltage @xmath4 applied between the top and bottom gls induces the negative electron charge in the emitter gl the equal positive charge in the collector gl .",
    "if the equilibrium electron concentration is low and the bias voltage is sufficiently strong , the hole gas will be formed in the collector gl . in glds with multiple - gl structures ,",
    "the inner gls remain quasi - neutral , so that the electron gas in each gl is formed primarily due the n - type doping , whereas the top and bottom gls can be charged due to the bias voltage .",

    "it is assumed that the glds under consideration are irradiated by the normally incident thz photons with the energy @xmath5 .",
    "the operation of glds is associated with the electron heating due to the intraband absorption ( drude absorption ) and the interband absorption ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) of the incident radiation resulting in an increase of the thermionic current over the barrier layers .",
    "thus , the proposed glds are the barrier hot - electron bolometers . in glds with the double - gl structures , the electrons entering from the emitter gl and exiting to the collector gl support the lateral current flowing via the contacts , so that the carrier densities in the gls are maintained . in the multiple - gl structures , the electron density in each gl between the emitter and collector gls is maintained due to the balance between the electrons leaving and entering gls via the adjacent barriers due to the thermal emission and the capture processes . if the probability of the capture of an electron crossing a gl is smaller than unity , the gld operation can exhibit the effect of photoelectric gain .",

    "( 12 ) ] and the same factor @xmath194 for qw - structures with gaas qws , one can find the ratio of these factors at the equal electron density @xmath6 and momentum relaxation time @xmath37 is given by @xmath195 where @xmath196 and @xmath144 are the effective and fictitious electron masses in qws and gls , respectively . for gaas qws and gls with @xmath197  mev ,",
    "these masses are approximately equal to each other .",
    "this implies that the thz power absorbed in qws and gls are close .",
    "however , the electron energy relaxation time in gls is longer than that in gaas - qws and other standard semiconductor qws .",
    "this is mainly due to relatively large optical phonon energy in gls . indeed , using eq .",
    "( 14 ) and assuming that @xmath198  ps at the room temperature we obtain @xmath199  ps , while for gaas ( @xmath200  mev and @xmath201  ps ) , inas ( @xmath202  mev and @xmath203  ps ) , and insb ( @xmath204  mev and @xmath205  ps ) qws one obtains @xmath206 , 0.93 and 3.93  ps , respectively .",
    "longer electron energy relaxation time corresponds to more effective heating of the electron gas and , hence , higher responsivity .",
    "an other factor promoting higher responsivity ( and detectivity ) of glds is the possibility to achieve higher photoelectric gain due to smaller values of the expected capture parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the thz qwps using the direct intersubband photoexcitation from qws require the heterostructures with rather small band off - sets ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "they exhibit a modest responsivity ( about few tens of ma / w or less  @xcite ) with @xmath208 cm hz@xmath113/w at @xmath209  k  @xcite . hence , in the few - thz range , glds surpass qwps",
    ". glds with the grating using the plasmonic effects although should exhibit advantages over qwps in the range 6 - 10 thz ( see above )",
    ". additional advantages of glds might be associated with better heat removal conditions  @xcite than in the case of different a@xmath0b@xmath1 devices .",
    "due to a substantial progress in fabrication and experimental studies of the multiple - gl structures with the inter - gl barrier layers made of transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the realization of the proposed glds appears to be feasible .",
    "in particular , similar gl - structures with five periods and 20  nm thick barriers  @xcite and with ten periods  @xcite were demonstrated .",
    "we proposed thz glds based on the double - gl and multiple - gl structures with the barrier layers made of ws@xmath2 exploiting the enhanced thermionic electron emission from gls due to the intraband ( drude ) absorption , developed the device model , and calculate the gld responsivity and detectivity at the room temperature .",
    "we demonstrated that glds , especially , those based on the multiple - gl structures can exhibit fairly high responsivity and detectivity surpassing hot - electron detectors based on the standard heterostructures .",
    "the main advantages of glds are associated with relatively long electron energy relaxation time and the pronounced effect of photoelectric gain at a low capture probability of the electron capture into gls .",
    "as shown , glds using the resonant electron heating associated with the plasmonic effects and glds exploiting the electron heating due to the interband absorption can also operate in the far- , mid , and near - ir ranges of the radiation spectrum .",
