    "nano - mechanical resonators are attracting interest in various areas of physics .",
    "because they are small and their vibrations can be strongly underdamped , even a small perturbation can lead to a detectable change of their frequency .",
    "this can be used for charge @xcite and mass @xcite sensing , high resolution magnetic force microscopy , @xcite and other measurements , see refs .   and papers cited therein .",
    "the analysis of the frequency change usually relies on the assumption that the properties of the system do not change during the measurement .",
    "for example , in mass sensing it is assumed that the massive particle attached to the resonator does not move .",
    "the motion would lead to variations of the vibration frequency in time .",
    "this is because the resonator displacement in the vibrational mode depends on coordinates , for example , for the fundamental mode of a doubly clamped nanobeam it is maximal at the center , whereas for a cantilever it is maximal at the apex .",
    "the larger the displacement at the particle location the stronger is the particle - induced frequency change.@xcite if the motion is random , there emerge frequency fluctuations , which broaden the spectrum of the resonant response .",
    "the effect of frequency fluctuations on the spectrum of an oscillator has been well understood in the limit where the correlation time of such fluctuations @xmath0 is small . in the limit @xmath1 ,",
    "if the fluctuations are gaussian , they lead to diffusion of the oscillator phase , keeping the oscillator power spectrum lorentzian , cf . ref .  .",
    "the effect of gaussian fluctuations with a finite correlation time has been also discussed in the literature , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "in the context of nanoresonators , an important role can be played also by random frequency jumps due to molecule attachment and detachment .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we consider the effect of phase fluctuations due to continuous in time random frequency variations , which are generally non - gaussian .",
    "a simple physical mechanism of such variations is diffusion of a massive particle along a nanoresonator .",
    "we develop a general method for describing the susceptibility of the oscillator with continuously fluctuating frequency .",
    "one might think that this susceptibility could be described by weighting a partial susceptibility for a given frequency ( with the imaginary part described by a lorentzian ) with the probability density to have such frequency .",
    "however , susceptibilities with close frequencies interfere ; in other words , to find the susceptibility one should add the amplitudes rather than the cross - sections of the corresponding transitions .",
    "we develop a method that takes this interference into account .",
    "we then apply the results to models of interest for particles diffusing along nano - resonators .",
    "another question of interest is the interrelation between the power spectra and the susceptibilities of underdamped oscillators in the presence of nonequilibrium frequency fluctuations .",
    "we provide the conditions of applicability of the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation , including the case of oscillators with weakly nonlinear restoring force and nonlinear friction .",
    "we also address the question of where the effects of oscillator decay and thermal fluctuations , on the one side , and of its frequency fluctuations , on the other side , can be considered independently .",
    "this analysis provides a link to the classical work on the lineshape of magnetic resonance in the presence of transition frequency fluctuations , where different methods were developed.@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the model , a single mode resonator with a massive particle diffusing along it .",
    "we assume that the vibrations do not affect the diffusion , that is , there is no back - action .",
    "we introduce the concept of partial susceptibility density ( psd ) for a given particle position and find it in the limiting cases of slow and fast frequency fluctuations . in sec .",

    "[ sec : unconfined_diffusion ] the psd is found in the form of a continued fraction for diffusion along a doubly - clamped nanobeam . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fdt ] we study the connection between the susceptibility and the power spectrum and find the conditions where the averaging over frequency fluctuations can be done separately from the averaging over thermal fluctuations of the oscillator . in sec .",

    "as mentioned above , for concreteness we assume that they are caused by a particle absorbed on the vibrating nanobeam or trapped in the microchannel inside the vibrating cantilever and diffusing along the nanoresonator .",

    "if @xmath13 is the particle position along the nanoresonator , we can write @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath16 can be called mass responsivity function ; it arises because the frequency change depends on the relative amplitude of the vibrational mode at the location of the particle @xcite .",
