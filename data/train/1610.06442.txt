    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) are collective oscillations of electrons occuring at the interface of materials .",
    "more than hundred years after their discovery @xcite , spps have promoted new applications in many fields such as microelectronics @xcite , photovoltaics @xcite , near - field sensing @xcite , laser techonology @xcite , photonics @xcite , meta - materials design @xcite , high order harmonics generation @xcite , or charged particles acceleration @xcite .",
    "most of these applications are based on expensive noble metals such as gold , silver or platinum , as these materials greatly support the plasmonic phenomena , exhibit very small ( plasmonic ) losses and the experimental results match well with the associated theory @xcite .",
    "although there were numerous studies addressing spps in lossy materials @xcite , some specific aspects remain to be investigated .    in this paper , a mathematical condition for spp excitation at flat interfaces is provided .",
    "this approach includes the widely accepted theory but reveals a wider ( material dependent ) domain of spp excitation than predicted by the existing literature .",
    "the importance of the terms originating from losses is underlined and complemented by formula of the spp near - field period and lifetime .",
    "at a planar interface between two different materials , the electric field components ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic field components ( @xmath1 ) can be calculated by solving the helmholtz equation for transverse magnetic ( tm ) and transverse electric ( te ) boundary conditions @xcite . for the geometry provided in fig .",
