    "the physics of unrestricted three - dimensional incompressible fluid flow is mathematically encoded in the corresponding set of navier - stokes equations ( nse ) governing the time evolution of velocity ( momentum ) @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 in three dimensional euclidean space . letting @xmath3 denote the velocity of an incompressible fluid at the position @xmath4 and and time @xmath5 ,",
    "essentially newton s law of motion may be cast as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a positive ( viscosity ) parameter , @xmath8 @xmath9 is the ( vector ) _ laplacian _ operator , and @xmath10 is an ( external forcing ) function with values in @xmath11 . more generally ( [ nseqn ] ) may be posed on a domain in @xmath11 with boundary .",
    "however for convenience in this paper we will consider the free - space model without boundary or an external force .",
    "the term @xmath12 represents the acceleration of a fluid parcel within a lagrangian reference frame .",
    "in particular , the non - linearity @xmath13 is intrinsic to this description of the flow and can not be eliminated .",
    "the viscous force @xmath14 is the result of a linearization of stress - strain forces between fluid parcels composing the fluid , and the _ divergence - free _",
    "condition @xmath15 provides conservation of mass ; also referred to as _",
    "incompressibility_. the pressure gradient term @xmath16 is a fourth unknown in the set of four equations describing the @xmath17 coordinates of velocity @xmath18 and the scalar pressure @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for more background on the physical derivation of the navier - stokes equations .    the unique determination of @xmath1 from the given viscosity parameter @xmath7 , external forcing @xmath10 ( in our case @xmath19 ) , and initial data @xmath20 is an obvious question for both the physics and the mathematics of fluid flow . after more than one - hundred years of research",
    "it remains unknown whether smooth initial data @xmath21 leads to the existence of unique smooth ( regular ) solutions , valid for all time .",
    "it is believed that mathematical progress on this issue is closely connected to understanding the physical phenomenon of _ turbulence_. as a consequence , the resolution of the uniqueness and regularity problem for the navier - stokes equations ranks among the most important open problems of contemporary applied and theoretical mathematics .",
    "the current state of the regularity issue may be viewed through the prism of natural scaling ( symmetry ) peculiar to of the navier - stokes equations as follows    @xmath22    the quantities of the flow ( typically represented by certain norms of @xmath23 ) that preserve this scaling are called _ critical _ , the ones that grow as @xmath24 are _ super - critical _ , and the ones that decrease are _ sub - critical_. for example , since the pioneering work of leray in the 1930 s ( see @xcite , which still remains a benchmark for the regularity problem ) , it is known that nse possess global - in - time weak solutions that are bounded in @xmath25 . if we re - scale the @xmath25-norm of @xmath23 according to the scaling above we obtain @xmath26 and so @xmath27 is a super - critical quantity . yet , according to leray s result , the solution is regular as long the @xmath25 norm of the ( vector ) gradient remains bounded : @xmath28 i.e. leray s regularity condition is sub - critical .",
    "more modern regularity criteria still suffer similar scaling defects : the escauriaza , seregin and verk criterion involving boundedness of the @xmath29-norm ( see @xcite ) , as well as the koch and tataru condition of smallness of the initial data in the bmo@xmath30 functional space ( @xcite ) , are each critical in nature .",
    "this gap between what is known for the solutions of nse ( all of which are super - critical ) and the sufficient conditions for regularity , is one of the manifestations of the important role scaling plays in the nse well - posedness problem .",
    "there is a growing consensus that functional and harmonic analysis techniques alone would not be sufficient to break the regularity problem by obtaining a super - critical condition for well - posedness .",
    "specifically , there are examples on nse - like systems that blow - up in finite time despite many functional properties characteristic to nse ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests a necessity of developing new approaches to understand nse and non - linear systems in general .",
    "in particular , our results suggest that the stochastic multiplicative cascade framework introduced by le jan and sznitman ( @xcite ) may provide new insights into the nse regularity problem . indeed ,",
    "in this note we establish a new scaling - critical condition for uniqueness of solutions , as well as provide evidence of a connection between the issue of uniqueness and natural scaling of the nse .",
    "a natural way to explore the role of scaling in the theory of nse is to consider _ scaling - invariant _ or _ self - similar _ solutions , i.e. the solutions satisfying    @xmath31    leray @xcite observed that if @xmath32 is a self - similar solution to ( [ nseqn ] ) , then upon choosing @xmath33 for fixed @xmath34 , one has @xmath35 where @xmath36 leray himself had the idea to use this self - similarity ( backwards in time , with @xmath37 ) to produce an example of blow - up in the nse problem .",
    "this was eventually proved impossible due to the work of tsai ( @xcite ) , as well as neas , rika , and verk ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite ) who established that backward - in - time the only self - similar solution is @xmath38 .",
    "study of forward in time self - similar solutions , particularly of equation ( [ lerayeqtn ] ) , revealed several important existence and uniqueness as well as regularity results ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , meyer ( @xcite ) provided a framework of constructing solutions that are unique in a weak @xmath29-space starting from `` small '' initial data .",
    "we note that the self - similar solutions must invariably posses singularity at the origin , as they are homogeneous functions of degree -1 .",
    "the weak-@xmath29 space is a natural functional space for such functions .",
    "later gruji ( @xcite ) showed that the solutions built by meyer are in fact smooth ( outside the origin ) .",
    "more recently , jia and verk ( @xcite ) proved existence of smooth solutions for ( [ lerayeqtn ] ) , without a smallness assumption , pointing to a potential for lack of uniqueness of self - similar solutions for ` large ' initial data and showing a pathway of how such solutions might be used to produce blow - up in navier - stokes equations .",
    "cannone and karch ( @xcite ) also argued for the connections between the theory of self - similar solutions with large initial data and possible emergence of singularities in the nse .",
    "the fact that self - similar solutions could be used to prove / disprove well - posedness for general nse is another manifestation of the particular importance of scaling symmetries in the navier - stokes equations .      in this paper",
    "we seek to provide an approach to both self - similar , as well as general nse problems that could shed light into the specific issue related to this natural scaling , to be referred to as _ symmetry breaking _ , namely :    _ is the uniqueness of solutions to nse tied to the uniqueness of self - similar solutions ? _",
    "if the solutions to ( [ lerayeqtn ] ) are unique , yet the solutions to ( [ nseqn ] ) are not , then we have a manifestation of symmetry breaking in nse , signaling that a possible lack of well - posedness could be the result of a mechanism that magnifies / creates deviations from natural scaling present in the initial data . on the other hand ,",
    "if the uniqueness for ( [ lerayeqtn ] ) is closely tied to the uniqueness in ( [ nseqn ] ) , then the well - posedness problem is essentially connected to the natural symmetries of navier - stokes equations .",
    "thus , the notions of scaling invariance and self - similarity , considered from the perspective of symmetry breaking , provide the central focus of the present paper .",
    "we consider this issue in the framework of le jan - sznitman stochastic multiplicative cascades , developed in @xcite , combined with the idea of majorizing kernels , introduced in @xcite , to investigate existence and uniqueness of a mild solutions to the nse ( see ( [ mildnse ] ) below ) . in this framework",
    ", a multiplicative cascade process is associated to the mild formulation of nse in fourier space , and a solution is recovered form the initial data via an expected value of a certain recursive product along a generated tree .",
    "the space of initial data allowed is in part governed by the choice of the majorizing kernel ( see section [ sec2 ] for details ) .    in order to guarantee finiteness of the tree , a _ thinning procedure _",
    "is usually employed .",
    "the thinning , which involves a chance of artificially terminating a branch , is guaranteed to generate a finite cascade , producing a unique mild solution to nse , but at an expense of shrinking the smallness condition on the initial data .",
    "in contrast to the classical le jan - sznitman approach , we will not employ a thinning procedure to terminate the cascade ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "elimination of thinning is a step towards accommodating wider families of initial data by relaxing , and eventually removing the aforementioned smallness condition .",
    "however , in the absence of thinning , one has to deal with a possibility of the formation of infinite cascade trees in finite time ",
    "the phenomenon called _ explosion _ , and our main object of study .",
    "in particular , we will not be concerned with the issue of existence of mild solutions built with such procedure ( the solution is guaranteed to exist as long as the cascade is non - exploding and the associated expected values are finite  see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "also , we will not study regularity properties of such solutions ( a difficult question , especially for more general spaces of initial data ) . instead , our goal is to show that the _ explosion _ phenomenon in such cascades can be used as a _ surrogate for uniqueness _ for the solutions of the nse in a certain functional class , allowing us to classify the associated uniqueness problems by the corresponding explosion time random variables .",
    "specifically , we use this approach to study two families of nse initial data : one governed by the bessel majorizing kernel ( [ bessel_kernel ] ) ( in which case we are able prove the non - explosion ) , as well as the dilogarithmic kernel ( [ dilog_kernel ] ) ( which allows for a much wider space of initial data , but with a more nuanced explosion problem ) .",
    "we also adapt this approach to the study of scaling - invariant solutions ( see section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "this forces a very different choice of the scaling parameter @xmath39 ( see ( [ self - sim_scaling ] ) ) than the one in ( [ lerayscaling ] ) , partly because the problem is posed in the fourier setting .",
    "nevertheless we show that the self - similar mild formulation we use  ( [ mildssns ] ) , and the leray equation ( [ lerayeqtn ] ) are in fact equivalent ( proposition [ prop : leray_eq ] ) .",
    "moreover , although the resulting cascade is quite different from the general nse case described in section [ sec2 ] , the dilogarithmic density appears naturally in the context of scaling - invariance ( see ( [ mildssns ] ) ) .",
    "the explosion problems themselves are defined in terms of the _ explosion time _",
    "random variables in both non - symmetric and scaling - invariant cases ( see definitions [ expltime ] and [ selfsimilarexplosion ] )  _ critical _ ( with respect to the scaling ) quantities . using the le jan - sznitman martingale argument , we show that in the case of general nse , the non - explosion of the associated multiplicative cascade provides a _ scaling - critical sufficient condition for uniqueness _",
    " see proposition [ prop : uniq ] and remark [ crit_cond ] .",
    "a natural question is to compare the case of dilogarithmic majorizing kernel in general , non - symmetric setting to the scaling - invariant case . while we were unable to fully resolve the associated explosion problems , the main conclusion of this analysis ",
    "see theorem [ thm : main ] ",
    "is that at the level of cascades ,    _ the explosion problem is the same in both self - similar and general case ( in dilogarithmic settings ) .",
    "_    this result provides evidence for a lack of symmetry breaking in the navier - stokes problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sec2 ] we will use the le jan - sznitman cascade without thinning , together with the idea of majorizing kernels , to formulate an explosion problem ( definition [ expltime ] ) closely connected to the issue of uniqueness of solutions to the mild nse formulation ( [ mildnse ] )  see proposition [ prop : uniq ] .",
    "two particular kernels are considered ( see ( [ bessel_kernel ] ) and ( [ dilog_kernel ] ) ) . in the case of bessel kernel , @xmath40",
    ", we can prove the non - explosion ( see theorem [ th : nonexplosionbessel ] in the appendix ) . in the case of less restrictive dilogarithmic kernel , @xmath41",
    ", we prove that the explosion is related to the uniqueness property of a certain solution to a non - linear pde ( see proposition [ prop : pside ] ) .    in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "an analogous procedure will be employed to arrive to an explosion problem in the self - similar case ( definition [ selfsimilarexplosion ] ) . in particular , we relate the solutions obtained with this method to the solutions of the above - mentioned leray equation ( proposition [ prop : leray_eq ] ) , and prove ( theorem [ thm:0 - 1 ] ) that the explosion itself is a zero - one event ( i.e. it is essentially deterministic ) .",
    "we also show in theorem [ thm : main ] that this explosion event has the same distribution as the explosion in the dilogarithmic case described in section [ sec2 ]  the evidence towards similarity between the two uniqueness problems .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to comparison of the general and self - similar cases from the point of view of the symmetry breaking question , and discusses some open problems .    finally , section [ appendix ] is the appendix containing the proofs of the technical results related to the bessel and dilogarithmic random walks , which appear in the functional settings adopted in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "it is worth noting here that _",
    "dilogarithmic random walk _",
    "( which arises naturally in the context of this paper ) appears to be a new multiplicative stochastic process that may be of broader interest , e.g , see @xcite for other occurrences of the dilogarithmic distribution in physics .",
    "next , we will describe the mathematical framework we use to analyze the existence and uniqueness problem for the navier - stokes equations more precisely , by specifying the meaning of solution .",
    "due to lack of existence results for smooth ( classical ) solutions , the notion of solution in the _ weak sense _ is frequently used , where derivatives are in the distributional sense , as this allows one to search among functions @xmath23 that are locally square - integrable in space .",
    "namely , a divergence - free vector field @xmath42 is called a weak solution if for all @xmath43  smooth , divergence - free functions with compact support , @xmath44 under the implicit assumptions on @xmath23 that make the integrals above valid . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the ( complex ) @xmath25 inner product .",
    "this definition was introduced by leray to provide a mathematical framework that would accommodate the possibility that velocities may not be smooth at some small setof points where `` turbulence '' is present .",
    "indeed , leray s approach is proven to produce solutions that are are smooth except possibly a singular set of one - dimensional hausdorff measure zero ( see @xcite ) .    taking fourier transform in @xmath46 in the equation above",

    "the stochastic cascade framework in fourier space was introduced in @xcite for the analysis of ( [ mildnse ] ) .",
    "the basic ingredients of the recursively defined stochastic object ( cascade ) associated with the problem ( [ mildnse ] ) consists of ( i ) a continuous time binary branching markov process in three - dimensional fourier wavenumber space , and ( ii ) an algebraic operation @xmath63 defined in .",

    "the random events of either dying or splitting occur with equal probabilities and independently of @xmath65 . in the case of a split",

    "we will refer to @xmath40 as the _ bessel majorizing kernel _ , and to @xmath41 as _ dilogarithmic majoring kernel_. the connection with bessel and dilogarithmic distributions will be given in propositions [ besselbmc ] and [ dilogbrw ] ( see also remark [ rem : dilog ] ) .",
    "we define the conditional densities : @xmath79    if the particle dies , the ( fourier transformed ) forcing term , evaluated at its parent mode and appropriately scaled , is attached to the terminal node .",
    "otherwise , if branching occurs this rule is repeated from each of the nodes at respective frequencies @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the focus of the present article is the unforced ( @xmath82 ) equation ( [ nseqn ] ) , in which case such a convention may be viewed as a thinningoperation , that may not be necessary so long as there are only finitely many branches by any finite time @xmath83 . if thinning is applied , however , then the associated genealogical tree is that of a critical binary galton - watson process and therefore in fact almost surely finite , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "to be clear , in the case of no - forcing ( @xmath84 ) the le jan - sznitman algorithm results in a _ thinning _ of the full binary tree that may be ignored so long as the branching process is _ non - explosive_. this observation will be elaborated upon as a point of focus in the present paper .    the algebraic operation @xmath63 is applied to a vector - valued function of the offspring @xmath85 , provided by the initial data @xmath86 , at each node of the genealogical tree having parental wavenumber @xmath59 as defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the projection of @xmath53 onto the plane orthogonal to @xmath59 .",

    "<S> thus , if the explosion event of the self - similar cascade is probabilistically different from the explosion event for the general , non - symmetric cascade in appropriate settings , then we would have a manifestation of symmetry breaking in the navier - stokes uniqueness problem  the scaling - invariant case being qualitatively different . </S>",
    "<S> while we are only able to prove partial results related to the associated explosion problems , the main conclusion of this paper is that the self - similar ( scaling - invariant ) explosion and the general , non - symmetric explosion ( in appropriate functional settings ) are the same , suggesting that scaling symmetry may be directly involved in the eventual solution of the outstanding navier - stokes well - posedness problem . </S>",
