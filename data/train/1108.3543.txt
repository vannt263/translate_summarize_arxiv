    "despite the immense successes of laser deceleration and cooling for atoms , the direct application of these methods to molecules has been extremely limited , due to the absence of true two - level cycling transitions even in the simplest of diatomic molecules . instead",
    ", the explosive recent growth of activity on cold and ultracold molecules has relied on indirect methods including photoassociation , magnetoassociation , buffer - gas cooling , and others @xcite .",
    "the sole exception is the very recent demonstration of 1-d cooling and laser deceleration for srf molecules in the near - cycling @xmath0 transition @xcite .",
    "this was accomplished by using numerous repumping frequencies to recover molecules lost by radiation to the wrong vibrational , fine - structure , or hyperfine level , thus permitting the thousands of excitation - decay cycles required to achieve a significant radiative force .    in this paper",
    "we examine the prospects for greatly enhancing the radiative force on molecules by utilizing the optical bichromatic force ( bcf ) , in which many stimulated cycles of excitation and emission occur for each radiative cycle .",
    "there are numerous diatomic molecules with near - cycling transitions for which laser deceleration and cooling should be at least marginally practical @xcite , many of them polar molecules that are of particular interest at ultracold temperatures because of their strong anisotropic interactions @xcite .",
    "if a bcf enhancement of the radiative force by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude can be obtained , the task becomes far easier . as a representative example , we examine in some detail the requirements for decelerating a beam of calcium monofluoride molecules .",
    "we select caf as a prototype molecule both because it has an easily - accessible near - cycling transition and because it is well - suited to studies of ultracold molecular physics and chemistry .",
    "its excited - state spectrum has been studied very extensively , particularly in rydberg states @xcite , which should greatly facilitate future high - resolution experiments on laser - cooled beams or trapped samples of this species .",
    "in addition to calculations for caf , we also report experimental tests in atomic helium of one of the key requirements , the production of bichromatic forces in a multi - level system with several simultaneously cycling transitions , not all of which contribute to the force .     from resonance at @xmath1 .",
    "for large molecular velocities @xmath2 , doppler offsets of @xmath3 must also be added .",
    "the frequency pairs at @xmath4 give rise to a series of rf beat notes , each with a pulse area of approximately @xmath5 .",
    "alternating cycles of excitation from the right and stimulated emission from the left produce a large decelerating force directed to the left .",
    "the direction is controlled by the relative phase of the beat notes from the right and the left . ]    of the several configurations utilizing two - frequency beams that can yield rectified optical forces @xcite , it is well - established that the counterpropagating - beam bcf configuration shown in fig .",
    "1 works best for deceleration and cooling of a two - level system @xcite . here",
    "a pair of oppositely directed two - color beams is configured so that in the frame of a moving atom or molecule , the doppler - shifted frequencies in each beam are @xmath6 , thus creating a pair of counterpropagating beat note pulse trains . if the laser power is chosen so that the area of each rf beat - note pulse is approximately @xmath5 , the atom or molecule will experience a sequence of alternating excitations and stimulated de - excitations .",
    "a large deceleration results if the excitations come from the right - hand beam and the de - excitations from the left .",
    "if the beat notes have a relative rf phase of @xmath7 , heuristic arguments suggest that the correct sequence occurs on average 3/4 of the time , while the incorrect sequence , leading to acceleration , occurs 1/4 of the time . numerical calculations and experiments support this argument .",
    "if the cycling rate is fast compared to the radiative decay time , the average force can greatly exceed the ordinary radiative force .",
    "this concept was pioneered both experimentally and theoretically in the late 1980 s and 1990 s , largely by the group of yatsenko @xcite and by grimm and coworkers @xcite , who ultimately slowed a cesium atomic beam to 8 m / s @xcite .",
    "more recently the metcalf group at stony brook has extensively investigated the bcf on metastable atomic helium ( he * ) beams .",
    "they have demonstrated both transverse collimation and longitudinal slowing by 325 m / s in a region just a few centimeters long @xcite and devised improved theoretical treatments .",
    "however , bcfs have not so far been used to produce ultracold atoms for magnetic or optical trapping .    in view of this long and mostly successful history",
    ", it seems odd that bcf decelerators have found only limited use . in the case of alkali atoms",
    ", this is largely because direct or indirect vapor - cell loading often eliminates the need for a decelerator , and it is not particularly difficult to construct a zeeman slower when one is needed .",
    "another consideration is that it was technically difficult until recently to produce high - power cw laser beams at multiple frequencies with good control over the relative rf phase .",
    "there appears to be just one previous attempt to apply a bcf - like force to a molecule , a 1994 experiment in which counterpropagating mode - locked pulse trains produced a small transverse deflection in a na@xmath8 beam @xcite , with a total momentum increment up to @xmath9 that was limited by unwanted optical pumping into dark states . in that work ,",
    "the time sequencing of counterpropagating pulse pairs played a similar role to the phase shift between beat notes in the counterpropagating - beam bcf of fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_concept ] .    assuming that technical problems such as optical pumping can be overcome ,",
    "the force multiplication offered by the bcf at large detunings @xmath10 is even more attractive for near - cycling molecular transitions than for atoms , because the available interaction time is generally constrained by out - of - system radiative decays . in section [ sec : bcf ] of this paper , we discuss general considerations governing bcfs in a molecular transition , and in section [ sec : caf ] we consider the specific example of caf , still with an emphasis on readily generalizable approximations . in section [ sec : he ] we present a simple experimental test of the bcf in a multilevel atomic system , metastable he * atoms illuminated by @xmath5-polarized light .",
    "these experiments test both the feasibility of using the bcf in a multilevel system and the sensitivity of the force to energy level shifts away from the laser center frequency @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we begin with a summary of the basic bcf parameters for a two - level system , then discuss the modifications necessary for a near - cycling transition that may also contain multiple internal levels .",
    "for the two - level case , both the heuristic argument given above and theoretical dressed - atom treatments @xcite show that the maximum attainable bichromatic force for a two - level atom is given approximately by @xmath11    this is larger than the radiative force @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "the optimal rabi frequency for each beam is @xmath14 , slightly larger than the @xmath5-pulse condition of @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding laser irradiance for each beam is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ordinary saturation irradiance at resonance @xcite and @xmath18 is the upper - level decay rate .",
    "numerical calculations and experiments also show that the bcf has a much wider velocity range than the radiative force , @xmath19 compared with @xmath20 for a two - level system .",
    "clearly it is advantageous to use large detunings @xmath10 , but a practical limit is set by the quadratic scaling of the required laser power in eq . [ eq : irrad ] , which will eventually outstrip any available laser resources . in actual practice detunings of @xmath21 have been used successfully for metastable he atoms , although at @xmath22 we have seen evidence that the force begins to lose the symmetric velocity profile characteristic of rectified optical forces @xcite .",
    "another important property of the bcf is that it usually has a rather sharp lower velocity limit , which gives rise to cooling of the velocity distribution in addition to slowing , because the slowed molecules will `` pile up '' at the lower velocity limit .",
    "this is apparent , for example , in the results reported in ref .",
    "bcf cooling is the primary topic of a recent discussion by metcalf @xcite , who also mentions briefly the possibility of applying counterpropagating - beam bcfs to molecules .",
    "we now turn to the case of a near - cycling transition , initially without considering its degeneracy .",
    "a typical example is the @xmath0 , ( @xmath23 ) band in mgf , caf , or srf , for which the franck - condon factors are in the range @xmath24 @xcite , so the molecules will be lost to out - of - system decay in about @xmath25 spontaneous decay cycles unless additional repump lasers are added . in this case the above relations are still valid , but the maximum bcf momentum transfer will generally be limited by the time @xmath26 until an out - of - system decay occurs . to determine @xmath26 for a molecule with spontaneous decay lifetime @xmath27 and franck - condon factor @xmath28 , an estimate is needed for the probability @xmath29 that the molecule is in the excited state . for a single laser beam at the optimal irradiance @xmath30 ,",
    "this would be @xmath31 , but for a full four - beam bcf configuration the situation is more complicated .",
    "the bichromatic beat - note phase shift of @xmath7 corresponds to the condition that the molecules follow dressed - atom trajectories comprised primarily of the ground - state wave function @xcite , but the exact value of @xmath29 will depend on averaging over velocity profiles and laser mode profiles . here",
    "we will assume that @xmath32 , near the center of the possible range , and the loss - limited interaction time is given by @xmath33    the maximum possible velocity decrease from the bcf is given by the smaller of @xmath34 from eq .",
    "[ eq : range ] and the value obtained if deceleration continues for the full available time @xmath26 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of the molecule . in the two - level case",
    "this simplifies to @xmath37    = 1 level of the @xmath38 , @xmath39=0 ground state of caf to @xmath40=1/2 in the @xmath41 , @xmath42=0 state .",
    "the corresponding transition in srf was used for laser cooling in ref .",
    "the ground - state fine structure and hyperfine structure give rise to a total of 12 @xmath43 and @xmath44 levels , not shown . in traditional notation",
    "@xcite this is a combination of the near - degenerate @xmath45(0.5 ) and @xmath46(1.5 ) branches . ]      in any real molecular transition , the effects of small internal splittings and degeneracies must also be considered , including fine structure ( fs ) and hyperfine structure ( hfs ) as well as the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "for example , the caf and srf molecules each have nuclear and electronic spins @xmath49=@xmath50=1/2 , leading to structure such as that shown in fig . [",
    "fig : p_branch ] for caf .",
    "the analogous rotationally closed system in srf was used in recent demonstrations of doppler and sisyphus cooling @xcite . in either species , the upper - state hfs is negligibly small , but still gives rise to four near - degenerate @xmath43 sublevels , and the @xmath51  =  1 lower state has four well - separated hfs levels with a total of 12 @xmath48 sublevels . to achieve doppler and sisyphus cooling @xcite ,",
    "the states are intentionally mixed using a combination of zeeman mixing and several repumping frequencies that are introduced using electro - optical modulators .",
    "a vibrational repumping laser is also used to extend the value of @xmath26 .",
    "the net effect is to introduce a degeneracy that reduces the two - level radiative force , because the molecules spend only about 1/7 of their time in the less numerous sublevels of the excited state @xcite .",
    "there are two important differences between the bcf case and that of doppler cooling : first , the large rabi frequency used for the bcf causes power broadening that can make many or all of the fs and hfs levels nearly resonant , reducing the need for added repumping frequencies .",
    "second , a new problem arises because the transitions between the various sublevels have varying rates that can easily span an order of magnitude @xcite , and some will be detuned from exact resonance , so not all of them can simultaneously be driven at the optimal rate for the bcf .    to account for these effects",
    ", the results of the preceding section must be modified .",
    "the excited - state probability @xmath29 , previously taken to be @xmath52 , is estimated using a weighted degeneracy factor that has the same two - level limit , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the degeneracy of the excited state , @xmath55 is the degeneracy of the ground - state levels that are active in the bcf , and @xmath56 is the degeneracy of `` dark '' ground state levels that are populated but do not participate in the bcf .",
    "there is a certain arbitrariness to the method used for adjusting the excited - state fraction to a slightly non - statistical value , since for a strongly coupled multilevel system , the actual value is determined by system - dependent coherent cycling .",
    "we use the @xmath57 weighting because it correctly treats the effects of weakly - coupled dark levels on a system with multiple decoupled two - level cycles , such as the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_branch ] .",
    "repumping of these dark levels is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : repumping ] .    for the bichromatic force",
    ", the level - averaged cycling rate is reduced if only a fraction of the ground - state levels are active , again requiring a weighted degeneracy factor .",
    "an additional `` force reduction factor '' @xmath58 is introduced to account for possible further reductions in the bcf due to variations in line strength and frequency shifts from level to level , @xmath59 the degeneracy factor is again chosen to describe a system with multiple decoupled two - level cycles , and system - dependent deviations due to interference in multilevel coherent cycling are taken to be part of @xmath58 . the loss time is still given by eq .",
    "[ eq : t_loss ] , and the velocity change @xmath60 by the smaller of eqs .",
    "[ eq : range ] and [ eq : dv_loss ] , providing that the revised values of @xmath29 and @xmath61 are used .",
    "the ordinary radiative force is also reduced , although in this case the impact of degeneracies and dark states is purely statistical : @xmath62    to deal with the negative impacts of degeneracies and inexact rabi frequencies , at least three experimental schemes are possible , any of which might be preferable depending on the particular level structure and experimental objectives for a specific molecule :    \\(1 ) ignore the degeneracy , apart from adding a small magnetic field to circumvent optical pumping into coherent dark states , as in ref .",
    "a significant average bcf is still be possible , because as long as the bichromatic beat notes are phased properly the resulting force is always positive or zero , never negative , even for grossly incorrect values of the laser frequencies and the rabi frequency . assuming the force is applied for many radiative cycles",
    ", each molecule will spend some of its time in the sublevels for which the bcf is near - optimal , and every molecule will see the same time - averaged force . a complete quantitative model would require extending the numerical methods of refs .",
    "@xcite to a multi - level set of optical bloch equations ( obes ) tailored to each specific system",
    ". however , two - level obe simulations are sufficient to establish the tolerance of the bcf to non - ideal configurations .",
    "the results of such calculations for non - optimal rabi frequencies are shown in fig . 1 of ref . @xcite and fig .",
    "62 . of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicating that substantial forces are still produced for variations of up to about 20% .",
    "we have used similar numerical modeling to investigate the effects of frequency shifts away from the nominal resonant frequency @xmath1 , an issue that has not previously been studied .",
    "our modeling shows that as the shift increases , the bcf force profile always retains about the same velocity range , but the average force is reduced .",
    "table [ tbl : etavals ] shows the calculated force reduction factor @xmath58 as a function of the shift , measured as a fraction of the bichromatic detuning @xmath10 . in section [ sec : he ] we describe an experimental test in metastable atomic helium .    .[tbl",
    ": etavals]calculated force reduction factors @xmath58 for eq .",
    "[ eq : fb ] , for levels shifted from the laser center frequency @xmath1 .",
    "shifts are tabulated as a fraction of the bichromatic detuning @xmath10 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a separate variation of the experiment , we have also specifically tested the effects of frequency shifts in the pure two - level configuration , using an arrangement slightly different from fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] . for this measurement a small bichromatic detuning @xmath63 mhz was used so that the fiber amplifier could be omitted .",
    "the bichromatic slowing parameters were experimentally optimized with @xmath64 light , and then the laser center frequency @xmath1 was offset by using an aom in each of the two - color beams .",
    "we characterized the efficiency of bcf slowing by measuring the depletion dip in the velocity profile , at the velocity that corresponding to the minimum of the dip for zero shift .",
    "table [ tbl : he*_shifted ] shows the results , which show only minor effects until the shift reaches 0.4 @xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with the calculated force reduction factors @xmath58 in table [ tbl : etavals ] , because the interaction length was about 3 - 4 times the bcf slowing distance , meaning that the velocity profiles should not be much affected until the force is reduced by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "table [ tbl : etavals ] indicates that this should occur for shifts exceeding about 0.3 @xmath10 , where a sudden decline in the depletion dip is indeed observed .",
    "the most important aspect of this test , though , is not the onset of the decline so much as the demonstration that for shifts below 0.3 @xmath10 the bcf works well .",
    "this explicitly verifyies our expectation that the bcf will be robust against small molecular frequency splittings .",
    "it appears practical to use the bcf to obtain order - of - magnitude enhancements over the radiative force on diatomic molecules .",
    "the necessary conditions are that ample laser power is available , that the small - scale spectroscopic structure due to fine and hyperfine structure is not excessively complex , and that the rotational branch selected for bcf excitation is well - isolated from other branches involving the same upper and lower levels .",
    "specific calculations for the @xmath0 transition in caf show considerable promise for bcf deceleration and cooling on the @xmath65 branch of the ( 0 - 0 ) band , including the ability to decelerate an initially cryogenic beam to a stop if a vibrational repumping laser is used .",
    "operation with faster initial velocities may be possible by incorporating refinements such as properly phased multipass beams and coherent repumping .",
    "we demonstrate with an atomic helium experiment that the bcf is not greatly impacted by the presence of multiple , simultaneously - cycling transitions , by using @xmath5-polarized light to simultaneously drive three magnetic sublevels of the @xmath66 transition . in this example a substantial bcf is obtained even in the presence of strong off - resonant coupling to the nearby @xmath67 state , which produces large level - dependent frequency shifts .",
    "we also remark that the conditions for significant transverse deflection and cooling are much less stringent than for longitudinal deceleration , and the bcf has considerable promise as a method for producing state - selected molecular beams by deflection using long - pulsed lasers , even for transitions that are not close to meeting the near - cycling condition .",
