    "the success of employing simple ideal hydrodynamics @xcite in describing the large values of the elliptic flow @xmath4 measured in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite indicates that thermal equilibration of the produced quark gluon system occurs on a short time scale and that the equilibrium is maintained until the hadronization .",
    "it is of great interest to understand what mechanisms drive the system to equilibrium . while coherent quantum effects like color instabilities @xcite may play a role at the very early stage when the system is super dense , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) bremsstrahlung processes are essential for momentum isotropization of quark gluon matter @xcite when the matter becomes more dilute due to the strong longitudinal expansion .",
    "the importance of pqcd bremsstrahlung was first raised in the `` bottom - up '' scenario @xcite , which describes the thermal equilibration of a color glass condensate @xcite characterized by a saturation scale @xmath3 .",
    "the main idea of the `` bottom - up '' scenario is that while the hard gluons with transverse momenta of order @xmath3 degrade as the condensate evolves in space time , soft gluons with transverse momenta much smaller than @xmath3 are populated due to pqcd @xmath5 bremsstrahlung .",
    "soft gluon production dominates the early stage of equilibration and a strong parametric enhancement of the soft gluon number has been predicted . within a short time",
    "scale the soft gluon number becomes comparable to the initial number of hard gluons .",
    "as soon as the radiated soft gluons achieve thermal equilibrium and build up a thermal bath , the hard ones begin to loose their energy to the thermal bath and subsequently thermalize on a later time scale .",
    "a parametric time scale for overall thermalization is given by @xmath6 @xcite .    because color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite is proposed as a possible initial state of the quark gluon matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions , its thermalization is a highly interesting topic .",
    "for instance , the thermalization of an idealized form of color glass condensate @xcite was studied by bjoraker and venugopalan by @xcite solving the landau transport equation .",
    "serreau and schiff also investigated the same topic in @xcite where they used the relaxation time approximation to simplify the collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "a conclusion , which can be drawn from the two studies , is that pqcd @xmath7 collisions are not sufficient to achieve thermal equilibrium .",
    "hence , the inelastic @xmath8 processes are needed as emphasized in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .    the role of the pqcd @xmath8 processes for thermal equilibration employing the color glass condensate initial condition is investigated in the present work for the first time within a full 3 + 1 dimensional transport calculation using the parton cascade bamps @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung processes indeed lead to rapid thermalization . in this paper",
    "we focus on how thermalization occurs in bamps calculations .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether the `` bottom - up '' scenario is realized as the proper way to describe thermalization of cgc , which may be formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "note that the back reactions of the bremsstrahlung , i.e. , @xmath1 processes , are consistently incorporated in bamps , whereas they are missing in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "this , which is shown in our results , leads to a different thermalization picture from the one suggested by the `` bottom - up '' scenario .",

    "the main feature of bamps is the implementation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 processes in a consistent manner , which is based on the stochastic interpretation of interaction rates @xcite .",

    "bamps subdivides space into small cells , which are regarded as the local positions where interactions may occur .",
    "the smaller the cells the more local interactions can be realized . however , smaller cells contain fewer particles and thus lead to larger uncertainties in the extraction of @xmath13 .",

    "note that the divergence of the flow velocity can be better extracted from the simulations because it relates to the transport collision rate , as derived in @xcite .    due to large numerical uncertainties the entropy density",
    "it is difficult to extract @xmath40 from the simulations .",

    "the entropy density calculated in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) is , thus , larger than the true value in the simulations .",
    "figure [ etaovers ] shows the @xmath10 ratio in the calculations with @xmath90 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath91 , respectively .     and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    ", height=264 ]    before @xmath108 fm / c the values of @xmath10 are not reliable because at early times the gluon system is far from equilibrium and , thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eta ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) are not valid . from @xmath108 fm",
    "/ c on the @xmath10 ratio is nearly constant and has a weak dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath168 , which is exactly the same as that obtained in full 3 + 1 dimensional bamps calculations with @xmath90 and minijets type initial conditions for au+au collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "this verifies that the @xmath10 ratio determines the behavior of the late dynamics and , thus , depends only on the coupling @xmath9 , but not on initial conditions . moreover , the @xmath10 ratio obtained is small and close to the lower bound from the ads / cft conjecture @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath10 ratio corresponds to the efficiency of the pqcd @xmath8 processes in thermal equilibration , because the @xmath10 ratio is inversely proportional to the total transport collision rate and the transport collision rate of @xmath8 processes is @xmath169 times larger than that of @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "using the parton cascade bamps , we have studied the thermalization of potential color glass condensates , which might be appropriate for the initial conditions of high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the main emphasis is put on the comparison of the thermalization observed in our calculations to that in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "we found that several aspects of the real thermalization might be different compared to the `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "the difference arises because the back reactions of bremsstrahlung , @xmath84 processes , play a significant role .",
    "they are completely absent in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "first , the radiation of gluons is hindered by @xmath84 processes according to detailed balance .",
    "therefore , for the idealistic form chosen for cgc , the total gluon number will increase unless @xmath170 is very large , which is not realistic at rhic and lhc .",
    "we showed that for realistic initial conditions the total gluon number decreases early in the expansion . an exorbitant increase in soft gluons , as predicted in the `` bottom - up '' scenario ,",
    "is not possible .",
    "thus , no thermal bath of soft gluons will be built up .",
    "second , thermal equilibration of soft and hard gluons occurs roughly on the same time scale due to @xmath60 and @xmath84 processes , respectively .",
    "the energy flows into both the soft and hard sectors at the same time , which is potentially similar to the phenomenon of  avalanche  as observed in the field isotropization driven by the plasma instability .",
    "this behavior contradicts the `` bottom - up '' picture where soft gluons form a thermal bath and thermalize first whereas hard gluons loose energy to the thermal bath and , thus , thermalize later .    finally , the time scale of thermalization is determined for various values of @xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "it spreads from @xmath171 fm / c to @xmath172 fm / c for @xmath93 gev and @xmath173 . in agreement with the `` bottom - up '' scenario",
    ", the thermalization time proves to be proportional to @xmath174 , however , its proportionality to @xmath175 is not seen , but is much weaker : @xmath176 .    after being thermalized",
    "the gluon system shows quasi - hydrodynamical behavior : the cooling due to expansion is observed in the steepening of the transverse momentum spectra . to see how viscous the system is , we extracted the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density and obtained @xmath177 for @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath10 ratio has a weak dependence on @xmath3 and is close to the lower bound from the ads / cft conjecture .",
    "thus , the considered gluon system acts as being strongly coupled .",
    "the quick thermalization and the smallness of the @xmath10 ratio observed in the present calculations with the cgc initial conditions are consistent with the findings from the previous studies @xcite using the glauber - type minijets initial conditions .",
    "this demonstrates that independent of the chosen initial conditions , the pqcd bremsstrahlung processes ( and the back reactions ) dominate the dynamical equilibration and then keep the system behaving like a nearly perfect fluid .",
    "the higher order processes such like @xmath178 and @xmath179 will certainly lead to a larger total transition rate , however , their contributions are suppressed by higher order of @xmath180@xcite .",
    "further investigations are needed to quantify these contributions .",
    "the cgc initial conditions presented in this paper are idealistic .",
    "more realistic initial conditions in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions can be obtained by considering high momentum jet like partons(minijets)@xcite .",
    "this will modify the thermalization picture presented in this paper : @xmath1 interaction may become less dominant at the early stage of the thermal equilibration , however , it would not affect our conclusion that thermalization in the hard and soft sectors proceeds on the same time scale .",
    "a study will be presented elsewhere .",
