    "the @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem states that the global @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories are finite beyond the one - loop approximation . this theorem was first enunciated in @xcite for the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang",
    " mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "the unconstrained @xmath0 superfield formulation of the hypermultiplet was constructed in @xcite , where it was used for proving the finiteness of the @xmath2 sym theory . on its basis",
    "the detailed proof of the @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem was given in @xcite .",
    "using this theorem it is possible to obtain that @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories are finite if their one - loop @xmath3-function vanishes @xcite .",
    "a proof of the @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem based on the harmonic superspace approach was given in @xcite .",
    "deriving the non - renormalization theorem one implicitly assumes existence of a regularization which does not break the gauge symmetry and @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "however , a construction of a regularization which satisfies these requirements is not evident @xcite .",
    "in particular , the standard dimensional regularization breaks supersymmetry , and supersymmetric theories are mostly regularized by using its special modification , which is called the regularization by means of dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "however , the dimensional reduction is inconsistent from the mathematical point of view @xcite . in principle , it is possible to remove the inconsistencies , but the price is the loss of manifest supersymmetry @xcite . as a consequence , supersymmetry can be broken by quantum corrections in higher loops @xcite .",
    "in particular , the explicit calculations made in @xcite and subsequently corrected in @xcite show that for the @xmath0 sym theory supersymmetry is really broken by quantum corrections in the three - loop approximation if the regularization by means of dimensional reduction is used .",
    "this implies that in this case the assumptions used in the proof of the non - renormalization theorem are broken due to the loss of manifest supersymmetry .",
    "thus , the dimensional reduction can not be considered as a completely satisfactory regularization for supersymmetric theories and the proof of the non - renormalization theorem contains a hole . the purpose of this paper is to remove this hole and to justify finally the @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem .",
    "we would like to pay attention that there exists a consistent regularization convenient for using in gauge theories .",
    "it is called the higher covariant derivative regularization @xcite . for @xmath4",
    "supersymmetric gauge theories such a regularization can be formulated in terms of @xmath4 superfields @xcite , so that @xmath4 supersymmetry is a manifest symmetry at all steps of quantum calculations .",
    "this regularization appears to be very convenient for explicit computing the quantum corrections ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and for proving some general statements , such as deriving the novikov - shifman - vainshrein - zakharov ( nsvz ) beta - function @xcite and nsvz - like relations in all orders of the perturbation theory @xcite or constructing in all orders the nsvz - scheme @xcite . in particular",

    "@xmath0 supersymmetric theories can be certainly considered as a special case of @xmath4 supersymmetric theories with extra hidden on - shell @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "however , it is unclear from the very beginning that the @xmath4 higher covariant derivative regularization will preserve the above hidden supersymmetry .",
    "the first attempt to construct a version of the higher derivative regularization for the @xmath0 sym theories was made in @xcite , but the invariant higher derivative term was not written explicitly .",
    "the problem was again addressed in @xcite , where the higher covariant derivative regularization was constructed for an arbitrary @xmath1 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "however , the formulation in terms of @xmath4 superfields which was used in @xcite although preserve manifest @xmath4 supersymmetry , does not allow to preserve the hidden @xmath4 supersymmetry at all stages of quantum corrections calculating , because the gauge fixing term and ghosts have only manifest @xmath5 supersymmetry .",
    "it looks like the gauge fixing condition in terms of @xmath4 superfields is incompatible with hidden supersymmetry . as a result , a removal of the above hole in the proof of the @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem requires the additional study .",
    "it is clear that the most natural way to carry out such a study should be based on a formulation of the @xmath0 supersymmetric theories in terms of unconstrained @xmath0 superfields where @xmath0 supersymmetry will be manifest .",
    "it is known that the manifest @xmath0 supersymmetric formulation of the @xmath0 theories is given in the terms of the @xmath0 harmonic superspace @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , using this formalism it is possible to construct the @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge fixing procedure .",
    "that is why in this paper we formulate the higher covariant derivative regularization for @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories in @xmath0 harmonic superspace . as a result",
    ", we obtain a version of the higher covariant derivative regularization which allows to calculate quantum corrections in a manifestly @xmath1 supersymmetric way .",
