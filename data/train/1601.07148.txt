    "the data are that of the upper curve of fig .",
    "[ fig.robeta ] .",
    "we do not see a monotonous decreasing of entropy as the order parameter increases , as in fig .",
    "[ fig.sal ] ; rather , we see a behavior that is more rich and complex , similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig.robeta ] .",
    "note that every half loop of fig .",
    "[ fig.robeta ] appears here as a loop where the entropy increases and decreases . for every @xmath56",
    ", the maximum of @xmath128 corresponds to a minimum of the entropy . for large @xmath56",
    ", the passage @xmath182 occurs with very little change in entropy ; as @xmath56 becomes small the change demands a large variation in the entropy .",
    "this change in entropy as we change @xmath7 , for fixed @xmath6 , i.e. , a fixed  temperature  , is the latent change in entropy for a phase transition .",
    "the transition here is not only the order - disordered transition , but also , the order - order transition when we move from a pattern of @xmath111 crests to a pattern of @xmath183 crests .",
    "one major question is `` are these values for the order parameter , fig .",
    "[ fig.robeta ] , and entropy fig .",
    "[ fig.sro ] , one possible reality or spurious results from the model ? ''",
    "if one thinks about an ecological model out of equilibrium , where growth , competition , diffusion , dispersion , and nonlocality are present , it is quite reasonable to obtain multiple possible values for entropy .",
    "one value is obtained for each @xmath56 , i.e. , for each given possibility of a stationary mode . in dynamical evolution , the possibility of transition from one stationary structure to another is easier if many possibilities exist .",
    "part of the diversity and complexity we see in nature is exhibited in this simple model .",
    "we now turn to the central problem in the analysis of pattern formation .",
    "why should a biological system make a pattern ?",
    "our model allows us to obtain answers from a simple perspective .",
    "it is well established that nature favors diversity . in addiction it would be expected that patterns would reduce the entropy of the system .",
    "this is exactly what we find here . moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ romin ] ) , as well in figs .",
    "[ fig.map ] , [ fig.roal ] , and [ fig.robeta ] , it is clear that @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the existence of patterns means that a large number of individuals can live in a given ecological niche , i.e. , a number larger than that provided by a uniform density .",
    "thus , it would be expected that if we have an evolutionary population dynamics , where the systems can choose through natural selection of @xmath61 they will evolve to choose values for these parameters such that @xmath185 is large , where @xmath186 . thus , as shown by this minimal model , this could be a good reason for nature to make patterns .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath187 , then @xmath188 , and therefore the integral in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) is always negative .",
    "thus @xmath180 must be a decreasing function of @xmath128 .",
    "we also note that @xmath189 implies @xmath190 . consequently ,",
    "as the entropy is a decreasing function of @xmath128 , and since any pattern will have @xmath191 , we conclude that patterns will necessarily satisfy @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , this confirms mathematically the rule we have previously established that for nature to have more individuals in a given domain it has to create patterns .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a nonlinear integro - differential equation with double nonlocal terms for the population density function . in this formulation , we have two kernels and two correlation lengths @xmath6 for growth , and another one , @xmath7 , for competition .",
    "we have numerically solved this equation studied in detail how the population density evolves to a state of inhomogeneous density ( pattern ) or to a uniform density ( no pattern ) .",
    "we also obtained analytical solutions for the steady state as a cosine function for three peaks or more , and for two peaks as a double gaussian .",
    "the cosine type solutions are surprising for this complex nonlocal nonlinear integro - differential equation .",
    "we study the stability of the modes for a given density @xmath34 , and we have described how a transition from @xmath56 to a @xmath111 crests occurs as the competition parameter decreases .",
    "the breaking of the mode stability does not lead us to a bifurcation , rather to the addition of a new crest .",
    "this is similar to a recently observed phenomenon in nonlinear optics @xcite known as a pick adding .",
    "we define an order parameter @xmath128 that exhibits some very rich phenomena .",
    "the evolution of @xmath128 with @xmath6 is similar to the evolution of the order parameter in the liquid - vapor transition with temperature .",
    "the evolution of @xmath128 with @xmath7 shows that not only do the transitions between order and disorder occur , but also that the transition from a pattern of @xmath56 crest to a pattern of @xmath192 crest may occur , if the latent entropy conditions are appropriated .    finally , we believe that these results strengthen the relationship between patterns formation and phase transitions in complex systems with many phases , such as water @xcite , as we have mentioned before .",
    "the possibility of analysis of systems in higher dimensions , e.g. , @xmath193 , and , non - stationary states @xcite , and , the inclusion of noise @xcite , and competition between several species @xcite show that we are just at the beginning , and further investigations in this area will likely lead to further important breakthroughs .",
