    "attractive forces between colloidal particles , ranging in size from nanometers to microns , can be finely controlled in the laboratory through surface functionalization or addition of depletants , leading to a wide range of phases and dynamical behaviors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the inter - particle attraction range @xmath0 is much smaller than the particle diameter @xmath1 , the dynamical arrest of phase separation leads to the formation of colloidal gels  arrested , space - spanning structures  even at low particle volume fractions @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "gels form when particles are quenched into the liquid - gas phase - separation region of the phase diagram , and spinodal decomposition arrests  @xcite ; they have been observed experimentally in colloids and proteins  @xcite , and in computer simulations@xcite .",
    "the structure of these gels depend on @xmath2 , @xmath0 and the strength of the attraction  @xcite , and can form sparse , ramified semi - solid structures .    for dispersions of conducting particles , tuning the inter - particle attractions can alter the bulk electrical properties of the system  @xcite , for example enhancing electrical conductivity in colloidal fluids  @xcite by lowering the mean distance required for electrons to tunnel between particles",
    "if this enhanced tunneling were to persist or be amplified in the deeply - quenched region as well , this might provide a new route to designing materials with novel combinations of electrical and mechanical properties , such as new highly - conductive semi - solid materials which could have important practical applications in energy storage and transport .    in this article ,",
    "we explore how the gelation of conducting colloidal particles affects overall electrical conductivity , where electron tunneling between particles is the principal mechanism of electrical conductivity .",
    "we find using molecular dynamics computer simulations that the tunneling conductivity @xmath3 in the arrested gel phase depends only weakly on @xmath2 , and remains relatively high even for @xmath2 as low as @xmath4% . in this regime",
    ", we also find that @xmath3 is only moderately affected by varying @xmath5 by as much as one order of magnitude , where @xmath6 is the characteristic tunneling decay length .",
    "in addition , we perform the same analysis for gel structures formed in an experimental colloidal system with short - ranged , attractive depletion interactions ; we find a similar shortening of the relevant tunneling distances as the system evolves towards the arrested gel state .",
    "our results demonstrate that conduction via tunneling in gels of conducting colloidal particles can occur using realistic assumptions of microscopic parameters , opening up the possibility of creating new , lightweight , highly conductive materials with novel mechanical and electrical properties .",
    "our simulations comprise a colloidal system of @xmath7 conducting monodisperse spherical particles dispersed in an continuous insulating medium , with volume fraction @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the sphere diameter , @xmath9 is the number density and @xmath10 is the box size .",
    "we assume that the conductance between any two particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 is dominated by electron tunneling processes , with conductance @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the closest distance between particle surfaces , @xmath16 is the center - to - center distance between particles , @xmath6 is the tunneling decay length , and @xmath17 is a prefactor that we define so that the conductance between two touching colloids is @xmath18 .",
    "the potential barrier separating conducting and insulating phases determines @xmath6 , which typically ranges from a fraction of a nanometer to a few nanometers  @xcite .",

    "in particular , short - ranged attractive colloidal spheres are in an equilibrium fluid phase for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the critical value at the critical point of the gas - liquid phase separation  @xcite .",
    "because all short - range potential shapes yield the same thermodynamic behavior  @xcite , we select a square - well ( sw ) model of the interaction of the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the dimensionless potential range and depth . as in eq .",

    "in this regime , sw fluids of conducting particles display enhanced conductivity @xmath3 , relative to the hard - sphere case , as @xmath33 is decreased  @xcite .",
    "the inter - particle attraction enhances conductivity by drawing the particles closer together : the population of particles with separations lower than @xmath35 increases , thereby promoting short - length tunneling processes , which result in larger @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , in attractive colloidal fluids where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath3 is relatively large and depends only weakly on @xmath2 for @xmath39.@xcite    when @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , short - ranged attractive colloids undergo phase separation and can arrest to form gels : spanning structures that may sustain shear stresses even at low @xmath2  @xcite . in these gel configurations ,",
    "larger tunneling conductivities might be expected relative to the fluid phase at the same @xmath2 , as the mean separation between the particles forming the gel network falls below @xmath35 ; however , knowledge of potential range alone is insufficient to predict the conductivity level of the system , as previously shown for sw fluids of conducting colloids  @xcite . instead , the full interplay between tunneling , attraction and structure must be considered .",
