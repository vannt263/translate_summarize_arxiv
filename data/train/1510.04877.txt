    "the duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) equation is a first - order relativistic theory for the description of spin @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 bosons with a similar form as the dirac equation .",
    "substantiated on imbert s experiments @xcite , which suggested strong classical and quantum contradictions for longitudinal plane waves displacement , de broglie states that a possible non - zero rest mass to photons would be the right interpretation for that phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in fact , de broglie also suggested that the photon should be formed by the combination of two leptons and such a combination should be responsible for assign a mass to photon .",
    "driven by this idea and with a deep knowledge on the algebraic structure of dirac s equation ( relativistic equation for spin @xmath6 particle ) , de broglie begins his search of a first - order equation in the hope of obtaining an equation for a massive particle of spin @xmath5 , his massive photon @xcite .",
    "petiau was the first to obtain the matrix algebra of dkp @xcite ) , five dimensions ( representing particles of spin @xmath4 ) , and a trivial representation without physical meaning of one dimension @xcite . ] . simultaneously and",
    "completely unaware to the work of petiau , kemmer wrote the second - order proca equations and the klein - gordon - fock ( kgf ) equation as a set of coupled first - order equations .",
    "kemmer then conjectures about the existence of a matrix form describing this system of coupled equations , on which irreducible representations representing particles of spin @xmath4 ( scalar particles ) and spin @xmath5 ( vectorial particles ) .",
    "duffin develops the desired algebra for kemmer s theory @xcite .",
    "the dkp formalism allows an unified treatment of the scalar and vector fields and the wealth of couplings in the dkp formalism made the theory initially well received ; in fact , due to its unique algebraic structure this formalism enjoys a plenty of couplings incapable of being expressed in the theories of kgf and proca @xcite .",
    "however , the equivalence of dkp and kgf in the free and minimal electromagnetic coupling cases @xcite , both in classical and quantum pictures , led to a decreased interest in dkp theory .",
    "although the kgf formalism is apparently simpler when compared to the algebraic treatment of the dkp theory in a classical picture , this point of view changes dramatically in a quantum picture : the similar form between the dkp and dirac lagrangian expressions allows a very simplified mechanism to study scalar phenomena , once the mimetism with dirac theory can be used to understanding of the physical meaning of all the quantities obtained from the dkp theory @xcite .    in the last years",
    "the dkp theory has been studied on qcd at large and short distances by gribov @xcite , in the scattering @xmath7-nucleus kmais , covariant hamiltonian dynamics @xcite , in generalization to curved space - time @xcite , in a five - dimensional galilean covariance 5d , in the context of classical gauge invariance @xcite , in the epstein ",
    "glaser causal method @xcite and so on .",
    "although the extensive research concerning the dkp theory within the framework of gauge theory , it is desirable to consider its interaction with distinct gauge fields .",
    "it is a well - known fact that maxwell s electrodynamics is considered as being one of the most successful physical theories ; despite that , the research in pursuing gauge - invariant alternatives extensions in order to supplement it is an ongoing subject of study @xcite . among the several features that",
    "these variants are endowed , the main difference between these theories is due to the nonlinearity of the field equation , e.g. born - infeld and euler - heisenberg lagrangians , while the linearity of the field equation with higher - order derivatives , e.g. bopp - podolsky @xcite .",
    "it is a well - known fact that higher - order derivative ( hd ) theories have ostro , ref15 , in the light of effective field theory @xcite , better renormalization properties than the conventional ones - gravity @xcite ] .",
    "one of the most interesting contributions to show the effectiveness of the hd terms in field theory is the bopp - podolsky electrodynamics , a generalization of the maxwell electromagnetic field .",
    "moreover , the ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the podolsky lagrangian is the only linear generalization of maxwell electrodynamics that preserves invariance under @xmath8 .",
    "an important feature concerning the bopp - podolsky electrodynamics is the gauge fixing , i.e. on how to fix the correct physical degrees of freedom , since the usual lorentz condition is not suitable .",
    "it was shown in the ref .",
    "galvao that the natural condition in the bopp - podolsky electrodynamics is the generalized lorentz condition , @xmath9=\\left ( 1+a^{2}\\square \\right ) \\partial ^{\\mu } a_{\\mu } $ ] .",
    "however , there are alternative gauge conditions that allow the same identification , in particular , and in order to preserve the order of the field equation , the so - called non - mixing gauge term @xcite , @xmath9=\\left ( 1+a^{2}\\square \\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\partial ^{\\mu } a_{\\mu } $ ] , which is a pseudo - differential operator @xcite .",

    "it was shown in these series of papers that the podolsky photon has the quality of controlling uv divergencies , leading to an almost finite theory , since the finiteness depends on the divergence degree of the diagram . further analysis with bopp - podolsky electrodynamics",
    "were realized at thermodynamical equilibrium @xcite , with boundary conditions @xcite , and in the presence of external sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in previous analysis the authors have determined a bound for the free parameter @xmath11 gev bufalo2 , daniel .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that higher - derivative theories have a hamiltonian which is not bounded from below @xcite and that the addition of such terms leads to the existence of negative norm states ( or ghosts states ) jeopardizing thus the unitarity @xcite . despite the fact that many attempts to restore the unitarity by means of overcoming these ghost states , no one has been able to give a general method to deal with them @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , recently in ref .",
    "@xcite a procedure was suggested for including interactions in free hd systems without breaking their stability , remarkably it was shown that the dynamics of the gqed is stable at both classical and quantum level .",
    "therefore , based on the positive aspects and outcome of both bopp - podolsky electrodynamics and dkp theory , it is rather natural a systematic study of their interaction .",

    "was performed , showing that the respective original counter - terms are sufficient to absorb all the primitive divergences .",
    "the information gathered from the study of the radiative corrections of gsdkp@xmath10 can be compared with the results for gsqed@xmath10 @xcite .",

    "what is interesting to note is that gsqed@xmath216 has two vertices and gsdkp has just one , this fact makes the analysis of higher loops apparently much easier in the framework of dkp theory rather than in the scalar qed .",
