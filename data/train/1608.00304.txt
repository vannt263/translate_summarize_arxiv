    "near - field wireless power transfer ( wpt ) has drawn significant interests recently due to its high efficiency for delivering power to electric loads without the need for any wire .",
    "inductive coupling ( ic ) @xcite is the conventional method to realize near - field wpt for short - range applications typically in a couple of centimeters .",
    "the wireless power consortium ( wpc ) that developed the `` qi '' standard @xcite is the main industrial organization for commercializing wireless charging based on ic .",
    "recently , magnetic resonant coupling ( mrc ) @xcite has been applied to significantly enhance the transfer efficiency as well as range for wpt compared to ic , thus opening a broader avenue for practical applications . in mrc",
    "enabled wpt ( mrc - wpt ) , compensators each being a capacitor of variable capacity are embedded in the electric circuits of the power transmitter and receiver to tune their oscillating frequencies to be the same as the frequency of the input voltage / current source to achieve resonance . alternatively , resonators each of which constitutes a simple rlc circuit resonating at the source frequency can be deployed in close proximity of the coils of the off - resonance power transmitter and receiver to help efficiently transfer power between them . with mrc , the total reactive power consumption in the system is effectively minimized due to resonance and thus high power transfer efficiency is achieved over longer distance than ic @xcite .",
    "the preliminary experiments in @xcite show that mrc enables a single transmitter to transfer @xmath0 watts of power wirelessly with @xmath1@xmath2 efficiency to a single receiver at a distance of about @xmath3 meters . formed after the merging between alliance for wireless power ( aw4p ) that developed the `` rezence '' specification and power matters alliance ( pma ) , airfuel alliance is the main industrial organization for promoting wireless charging based on mrc @xcite .",
    "the rezence specification advocates a superior charging range , the capability of charging multiple devices at the same time , and the use of two - way communication via e.g. bluetooth between the charger unit and devices for real - time charging control .",
    "these features make rezence and its future extensions a promising technology for wireless charging systems .    in the current rezence specification , one transmitter with a single coil",
    "is used in the power transmitting unit , i.e. , only the single - input multiple - output ( simo ) mrc - wpt is considered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wpttable](a ) .",
    "although this centralized wpt system performs well when the receivers are all sufficiently close to as well as perfectly aligned with the transmitter , the power delivered to a receiver decays significantly as it moves more distant away from the transmitter or misaligns with its orientation .",
    "this thus motivates distributed wpt where the single centralized transmitter coil is divided into multiple coils each with smaller size ( radius ) and these coils are placed in different locations to cover a given region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wpttable](b ) . by coordinating the transmissions of multiple coils via jointly allocating their source currents , in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that their induced magnetic fields can be directed more efficiently toward one or more receivers at the same time , thus achieving a _",
    "magnetic beamforming _ gain in a manner analogous to multi - antenna beamforming in the far - field wireless communication and power transfer @xcite .",
    "in addition , distributed wpt significantly shortens the distance from each receiver to its nearest transmitter(s ) compared to centralized wpt , thus achieves more uniform charging performance in the region .",
    "the optimal magnetic beamforming design in multiple - input single - output ( miso ) mrc - wpt systems has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite has formulated a convex optimization problem to jointly optimize the source currents at all transmitters to maximize the wpt efficiency subject to that the deliverable power to the receiver load is fixed . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite has jointly optimized the transmitter currents to maximize the deliverable power to a single load by considering a sum - power constraint for all transmitters as well as practical peak voltage and current constraints at each individual transmitter . recently",
    ", selective wpt has also been proposed for simo mrc - wpt systems in @xcite .",
    "this technique delivers power to only one selected receiver ( i.e. , receiver selection ) at each time to eliminate the magnetic cross - coupling effect among different receivers and hence achieve more balanced power transfer to them , assuming that their natural frequencies are set well separated from each other .",
    "alternatively , @xcite has proposed to jointly optimize the load resistance of all receivers in a simo mrc - wpt system to manage the magnetic cross - coupling effect and further alleviate the near - far issue by delivering balanced power to all receivers regardless of their distances to the power transmitter .",
    "the selective wpt technique has also been utilized in miso mrc - wpt systems where one transmitter is selected at each time ( i.e. , transmitter selection ) to deliver wireless power to a single receiver @xcite . in general",
    ", selective wpt requires a simpler control mechanism than magnetic beamforming , while its performance is also limited since only one pair of transmitter and receiver is allowed for power transfer at each time .",
    "in contrast , magnetic beamforming enables multiple transmitters to send power to one or more receivers simultaneously by properly assigning the currents in the transmitters and/or resistance values in the receivers , thus in general achieving better performance than transmitter / receiver selection .",
    "the studies in @xcite have shown promising directions to improve the efficiency as well as performance fairness in mrc - wpt systems , but all of which have assumed that the transmitters and receivers are at given locations in a target region . in practice , a wireless device ( e.g. , mobile phone ) is desired to be freely located in any position in the region ( e.g. , above a charging table ) when it is being charged , for more convenience of its user . in this case , given fixed locations of the transmitters in a msio mrc - wpt system , the deliverable power at a single receiver can fluctuate significantly over its locations .",
    "such power fluctuation degrades the quality of service , since the power requirement of the receiver load may not be satisfied at all locations in the region , even when magnetic beamforming is applied to dynamically adjust the magnetic fields according to the instantaneous location of the receiver .",
    "this thus motivates our work in this paper to optimize the transmitter locations and magnetic beamforming jointly in a miso mrc - wpt system to achieve the maximum and yet uniformly deliverable power in the region .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    * first , we formulate the magnetic beamforming problem for a miso mrc - wpt system with distributed transmitters to maximize the deliverable power to a single receiver subject to a given transmitters sum - power constraint , by assuming that the power transmitters and receiver are all at fixed locations .",
    "we derive the closed - form solution to the magnetic beamforming problem as a function of the mutual inductances between the transmitters and the receiver .",
    "our solution shows that the optimal current allocated to each transmitter is proportional to the mutual inductance between its coil and that of the receiver .",
    "for the special case when the transmitters are sufficiently separated from each other , we show that the optimal magnetic beamforming reduces to the simple transmitter selection scheme @xcite where all power is allocated to the single transmitter that has the highest mutual inductance with the receiver . * to demonstrate the performance gain of magnetic beamforming , we compare it to an uncoordinated wpt system with equal current allocation over all transmitters @xcite , as well as the transmitter selection scheme .",
    "furthermore , we compare the performance of distributed wpt with magnetic beamforming versus centralized wpt subject to the same total size of transmitter coils .",
    "* next , with the optimal magnetic beamforming solution derived , we formulate the node placement problem to jointly optimize the transmitter locations to maximize the minimum deliverable power to the receiver over a given one - dimensional ( 1d ) target region , i.e. , a line of finite length where the receiver can be located in any point in the line . although the formulated problem is non - convex , we propose an iterative algorithm for solving it approximately by leveraging the fact that the transmitters should be symmetrically located over the mid - point of the target line to maximize the minimum deliverable power .",
    "we present extensive simulation results to verify the effectiveness of our proposed transmitter location optimization algorithm in improving both the minimum deliverable power as well as the average deliverable power over the target line as compared to a heuristic design that uniformly locates the transmitters .",
    "* at last , we extend the node placement problem to the general two - dimensional ( 2d ) region case , i.e. , a disk in 2d with a finite radius . using an example of five transmitters ,",
    "we show that the design approach for the 1d case can be similarly applied to obtain the optimal locations of the transmitters under the 2d setup with magnetic beamforming to maximize the minimum deliverable power over the target disk by exploiting its circular symmetry .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the system model .",
    "section iii formulates the magnetic beamforming problem and presents its optimal solution .",
    "section iv formulates the node placement problem for the 1d target region case , and presents an iterative algorithm for solving it .",
    "section v presents simulation results for the 1d case .",
    "section vi extends the node placement problem to the 2d target region case with an example of five transmitters .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section vii .",
    "in this paper , we consider a miso mrc - wpt system with @xmath4 identical single - coil transmitters , indexed by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and a single - coil receiver , indexed by @xmath7 for convenience .",
    "it is assumed that all the transmitters and receiver are each equipped with a bluetooth communication module to enable information exchange among them to achieve coordinated wpt @xcite .",
    "each transmitter @xmath5 is connected to a stable energy source supplying sinusoidal voltage over time given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a complex number denoting the steady state voltage in phasor form and @xmath10 denotes its angular frequency .",
    "note that @xmath11 represents the real part of a complex number . on the other hand",
    ", the receiver is connected to an electric load , e.g. , the battery of a mobile phone .",
    "let @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , denotes the steady state current in transmitter @xmath5 .",
    "this current produces a time - varying magnetic flux in the transmitter coil , which passes through the receiver coil and induces time - varying current in it .",
    "we denote @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , as the steady state current at the receiver .    for the time being , we consider the case of 1d region for wpt , which is a straight line of finite length @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , the receiver can move horizontally along the line with its x - coordinate satisfying @xmath19 , which lies in the @xmath20 plane with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : miso - linear ] . note that @xmath23 denotes the absolute value of a real / complex number .",
    "the transmitters are installed at fixed locations along the line that is in parallel with the target line in the @xmath24 plane with @xmath25 .",
    "this 1d target line model is mainly used for the purpose of exposition , while it may be also applicable to practical scenarios such as a magnetic train that moves over segments of tracks each equipped with a number of distributed wireless power transmitters for charging the train .",
    "let @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) denote the location of transmitter @xmath5 ( receiver ) over the x - axis . in this paper , we consider that @xmath26 s are symmetric over @xmath30 . that such symmetric structure of the transmitters maximizes the minimum power deliverable to the receiver over the target line .",
    "] hence , we consider the following two cases for the symmetric deployment of the transmitters .",
    "* case @xmath31 : @xmath32 is even . in this case , let @xmath33 and we set @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",

    "denote @xmath45 as the resistance of the load at the receiver .",
    "accordingly , we use @xmath46 to represent the total ohmic resistance of the receiver . by assuming that the coil of each of the transmitters as well as the receiver consists of multiple closely winded turns of round - shaped wire , we obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) are the average radius of the coil of each transmitter ( receiver ) , the radius of the wire used to make the coil , the ohmic resistivity of the wire , and the number of turns of the coil , respectively . furthermore , we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59n / a@xmath60 is the magnetic permeability of the air @xcite . the capacities of compensators are then chosen such that the natural frequencies of the transmitters and receiver become the same as the source angular frequency @xmath61 @xcite , i.e. , we set @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "the integration terms in ( [ eq : h_nk ] ) and ( [ eq : h_n0 ] ) can be computed numerically , while there are no closed - form analytical expressions for them .    in practice",
