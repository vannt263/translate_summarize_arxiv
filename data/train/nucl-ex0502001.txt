    "the purpose of rhic is to map the phase structure of qcd .",
    "so far the community has concentrated on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions at @xmath6 gev in the hope of finding the quark gluon plasma .",
    "brahms special contribution has been to study the hadrons produced in these collisions over a broad range of @xmath0 and rapidity .",
    "the distribution of particles in rapidity and @xmath0 may give information on the transverse and longitudinal flow while the mix of different kinds of particles may tell us about the  quark chemistry \" of the system .",
    "it is on this aspect of the bulk behavior that we shall concentrate in this paper .",
    "brahms has measured particle spectra over a very wide range of rapidity and @xmath0 .",
    "our @xmath3 spectra are summarized in fig .",
    "[ dndy ] , which shows the rapidity densities , dn / dy , and the mean transverse momenta , , for @xmath7 , p and @xmath8 as a function of rapidity @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 and @xmath8 the yields peak at y=0 and drop significantly at higher rapidities .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 yields are nearly equal while an excess of @xmath12 over @xmath13 is observed that increases with rapidity .",
    "the mean @xmath0s , , for all particles decline slowly with rapidity .",
    "we have fitted the spectra themselves to the  blast wave \" model in order to estimate the transverse flow and kinetic freeze - out temperature @xcite .",
    "we find that the flow decreases with rapidity while the kinetic temperature tends to increase @xcite .",
    "traditionally thermal analyses have assumed that there is only one source in heavy ion collisions and have used particle yields integrated over all phase space as input . at rhic several groups have shown that such models can give an excellent description of a large number of particle ratios at _ mid - rapidity _ the use of mid - rapidity ratios has been justified on the grounds that there is a boost invariant region near y=0 .",
    "such a hypothesis implies that there is a different source away from mid - rapidity .",
    "we have investigated this idea by fitting our particle yields at several different rapidities to a chemical model @xcite .",
    "data at various rapidities .",
    "the curves are the one sigma contours.,width=288 ]    figure  [ tvmub ] shows that as y increases both the baryo - chemical potential and ( to a lesser extent ) the chemical freeze - out temperature increase .",
    "this may suggest that the system has fewer degrees of freedom at higher rapidities .",
    "figure  [ tvmub ] suggests that chemical freeze - out temperature changes more slowly with rapidity than the baryo - chemical potential .",
    "it is possible that this is also true as we change the collision energy ?",
    "figure  [ kmpvpmp ] shows the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ratios measured by brahms for @xmath3 and @xmath5 collisions at several rapidities .",
    "lower energy results are also shown .",
    "both the @xmath3 and @xmath5 results can be described by a power law , @xmath16 with @xmath17 for @xmath5 and @xmath18 for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "preliminary @xmath3 data from @xmath19 gev are also consistent with this fit @xcite .     and @xmath15 ratios for central @xmath3 and @xmath5 collisions .",
    "the na44 and na49 the results are for central pbpb collisions.,width=288 ]    recasting the power law fit in terms of chemical potentials gives @xmath20 independent of temperature .",
    "if we take this seriously then we should be able to predict the correlation between other strange particle ratios and @xmath21 just by counting the number of strange and non - strange quarks .",
    "for example @xmath22 and @xmath23 figure  [ xiomega ] shows the predictions of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as well as preliminary @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratios from na57 ( @xmath249 and 17gev ) and star ( @xmath2463 , 130 and 200gev ) @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the prediction and data is very good .",

    "the bands represent the error on the determination of @xmath27 from the brahms data.,width=336 ]",
    "thermal descriptions are a powerful way to describe @xmath3 collisions .",
    "chemical analysis of our particle yields hint that both the baryo - chemical potential and the chemical freeze - out temperature increase with rapidity .",
    "one could interpret this in terms of the system becoming less partonic ( with consequently fewer degrees of freedom ) at higher rapidities . at this stage however the data are also consistent with a constant temperature at different rapidities .",
    "the change of baryo - chemical potential seems to dominate the rapidity ( and energy ) dependence of the particle ratios .",
    "however the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is different for @xmath5 and heavy ion collisions .",
    "this may be an effect of the small size of the @xmath5 system .",
    "for central @xmath3 ( @xmath28 ) collisions the relationship @xmath20 derived from brahms data gives a good description of hyperon ratios .",
