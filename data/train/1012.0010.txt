    ", we derive @xmath173  k also accurately due to the large number of observed lines . in the case of @xmath6 , @xmath174",
    "k but this time the uncertainties are large since we have only observed two weak lines .",
    "the diversity of rotational temperatures indicate that these species are out of lte , at least in regions @xmath142 and @xmath150 , which dominate the molecular absorption .",
    "the results support a 3:1 ortho - para ratio for the polyacetylenes , i.e. , the ratio expected under lte conditions .",
    "this fact implies that the formation of polyacetylenes occurs in warm regions as suggested in previous works ( e.g. , c01a ; c04 ) , where the ortho - para ratio of the new molecules is given by the spin degeneracy .",
    "taking into account that the rotational contants of the polyacetylenes are small compared to the kinetic temperatures prevailing in the emitting regions , we do not expect ortho - para conversions even though they are not strictly forbidden , contrarily to the case of h@xmath26 at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , our result also points out that other processes capable of producing ortho - para conversions such as ( @xmath159 ) proton exchange with atomic hydrogen , ( @xmath160 ) collisions with paramagnetic molecules or ions such as h@xmath175 , h@xmath176 , or h@xmath177 , and ( @xmath178 ) spin inversion processes on the dust grain surfaces @xcite , are inefficient in the innermost cse .",
    "the @xmath5 column density in the cse is @xmath179  @xmath14 coming 45% from region @xmath142 , 30% from @xmath150 , and 25% from @xmath151 .",
    "the contribution from the agb - cse ( region @xmath180 ) is negligible .",
    "the averaged column density in the hvg is @xmath181  @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the total column density is @xmath182  @xmath14 , in good agreement with @xmath183  @xmath14 , the value derived by c01a from their low spectral resolution sws / iso observations ( see table  [ tab : parameters ] for an error estimation ) .",
    "in addition , the column density that we propose for the cse agrees with results of the time - dependent chemical models developed by @xcite , which bracket it in the range @xmath184  @xmath14 , depending on the evolution degree of the envelope .",
    "it is possible to estimate the @xmath5 abundance ratio between the clumps expanding in the hvg and the gas in the innermost cse and to compare this result with those of @xcite .",
    "assuming a characteristic length in the line of sight @xmath185  @xmath87 , the averaged gas density in the clumps is @xmath186  @xmath187 .",
    "hence , as the @xmath5 density in the innermost cse is @xmath188  @xmath187 , the ratio is @xmath189 . following the results by @xcite , this lower limit in the ratio",
    "would be achieved after @xmath190  yr of evolution .",
    "however , the age of crl618 as a ppn has been estimated in several hundreds of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath7 column density in the cse is @xmath191  @xmath14 ( 35% from region @xmath142 , 60% from @xmath150 , and 5% from @xmath151 ) , again with insignificant contribution from the agb - cse ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "as we do not see @xmath7 in the hvg , the total column density is that derived for the cse which is a factor @xmath192 larger than @xmath193 @xmath14 , suggested by c01a .",
    "the difference between both values is probably due to the large psf of iso compared to that of irtf ( @xmath194 and @xmath195 at @xmath196 m , respectively ) . in this case",
    ", our result is very similar to @xmath197  @xmath14 , the maximum abundance for @xmath7 according to the model of w03 for the evolution of the cse .",
    "as the abundance of @xmath7 in the hvg is much lower than in the innermost cse , we estimate the @xmath7 abundance ratio between the clumps and the innermost cse in a factor @xmath198 .",
    "this upper limit supports the results by @xcite , which suggest a ratio @xmath199 for clumps aged between 100 and 1000  yr .",
    "this period of time and that derived from the @xmath5 results suggest that a faster chemistry could be needed to better reproduce our results .",
    "however , the discrepancies between their results and ours could have to do with differences in the gas density , directly related to the adopted distance to the star , or different simplifications regarding the detailed physical structure of ppn ( see more complex models in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for @xmath8 ,",

    "there is no detectable contribution to the observed @xmath8 lines from region @xmath151 and from the hvg .",
    "hence , the total column density is in good agreement with the value of @xmath201  @xmath14 , derived by c01a .",
    "the maximum column density proposed by w03 ( @xmath202  @xmath2 ) is similar to our result but somewhat lower .",
    "it might indicate that the model developed by these authors needs to be slightly improved as far as the interaction between polyacetylenes and dust grains or unconsidered chemical reactions involving polyacetylenes are concerned .    finally , the column density of @xmath6 in the cse is @xmath179  @xmath14 and the averaged column density in the hvg is @xmath203  @xmath14 .",
    "both results are affected by a large error due to the weakness of the observed lines .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the total column density is @xmath204  @xmath14 ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) , in good agreement with @xmath205  @xmath14 proposed by c01a but smaller than the value of @xmath206  @xmath14 , derived by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy existing with the latter result can be attributed to @xmath6 molecules known to exist in the cold region @xmath180 ( agb - cse ) , unobserved through infrared observations . as in the case of @xmath7 ,",
    "the maximum column density expected by w03 is similar but larger than that derived by us , suggesting that their model works also fine for @xmath6 .",
    "the abundance of @xmath9 estimated from the results by c01a and that proposed by w03 and c04 suggests that the @xmath9 @xmath47 band should be observed in our spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , we have not found any pattern of lines that could be assigned to this species .",
    "the telluric contributions to the raw spectra of crl618 were removed by dividing the latter by the corresponding spectra of the bn object , free of intrinsic molecular lines in the observed frequency range .",
    "further corrections were performed to mend minor instrumental features from the spectra . therefore , we are sure we did not accidentally remove any broad feature such as the @xmath9 band . the upper limit to its total column density , calculated by assuming a peak intensity for the @xmath47 band lower than 10% the continuum , and the same excitation temperatures and coexisting with @xmath8 , is @xmath207  @xmath14 .",
    "this value is lower than the column densities of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the cse by a factor @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively .",
    "the abundance ratio @xmath57/[{\\ensuremath{\\textnormal{c}_4\\textnormal{h}_2}}]$ ] in the torus is @xmath211 , compatible with a region where the abundances have reached the steady state ( c04 ) .",
    "the abundance ratios in each region ( @xmath142 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 ) are @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , respectively .",
    "the abundances in @xmath142 seem to be in steady state while in @xmath151 they are still evolving . in region",
    "@xmath150 the ratio is very low indicating variations in the abundances , likely related to condensation onto dust grains or involvement in chemical reactions still unconsidered in the current chemical models .",
    "the ratio @xmath215/[{\\ensuremath{\\textnormal{c}_6\\textnormal{h}_2}}]\\simeq 2.3 $ ] , in good agreement with the results suggested by c04 for evolving abundances .",
    "the @xmath8 lines are too weak to derive reliable ratios for each region in the torus .",
    "the protoplanetary nebula smp lmc 11 , located in the large magellanic cloud , is known to display several bands in absorption arising from @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this fact suggests that the chemistry in its cse is very similar than in crl618 .",
    "hence , a comparison between these two sources could contribute interesting clues to a future chemical model of smp lmc 11 .",
    "the observations carried out in the infrared by @xcite towards smp lmc 11 show a wide absorption in the continuum ranging from @xmath216 to @xmath217 m , formed by the blending of several hundreds of lines of @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and other abundant molecules such as c@xmath218h@xmath218 . from this feature",
    "can be inferred that @xmath5 is more abundant than in crl618 , even as much as in irc+10216 ( with a column density @xmath219  @xmath14 ; f08 ) , where a broad absorption at @xmath220 m was also observed @xcite .",
    "the presence of strong hot bands such as @xmath221 , @xmath115 ( at @xmath222 m ) , and @xmath223 ( at @xmath224 m ) in absorption indicates that the vibrational temperature in the innermost cse should be @xmath225  k , i.e. , between those of crl618 ( with weak hot bands ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1](a ) ) and irc+10216 ( with strong hot bands ; f08 ) .",
    "this excitation would be probably caused by a somewhat strong infrared radiation field produced by the warm dust , as in the case of irc+10216 ( e.g. , f08 ) .",
    "concerning the rest of the polyacetylenes , the lower abundance ratio between @xmath8 and @xmath7 in smp lmc 11 than in crl618 suggest than the former source is chemically less evolved than the latter ( w03,c04 ) , in agreement with @xcite . to date , it has been impossible to clearly detect @xmath9 towards crl618 .",
    "however , the great resemblance in their chemistry and the good agreement between observations and chemical models suggest that @xmath9 could be built - up from @xmath8 in the cse of both sources .",
    "@xcite compare in their figure 2 two low resolution mid - infrared spectra of crl618 and smp lmc 11 .",
    "these spectra seem to share a weak unidentified feature at @xmath226 m , between the bands @xmath227 and @xmath228 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively",
    ". this feature could be the q branch of the @xmath9 band @xmath229 , several times stronger than @xmath47 at room temperature @xcite .",
    "it should be observed in the future with higher spectral resolution to assess whether it can be assigned to the @xmath229 band of @xmath9 .",
    "the recent discovery of c@xmath30 and c@xmath31 @xcite strongly support the growth mechanism for carbon clusters proposed by c04 . in his models , carbon clusters",
    "where produced from the photodissociation of polyacetylenes and , although limited to c@xmath230 , the predicted abundances for these large carbon species is very large .",
    "in this paper , we present high - resolution mid - infrared observations towards the ppn crl618 .",
    "the sampled spectral range ( @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xmath2 ) observed with the high resolving power spectrograph texes allow us to resolve bands @xmath33 and @xmath37 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , in addition to several lines of bands @xmath112 and @xmath113 of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these rich data have enabled the modeling of the useful ro - vibrational line profiles of these molecular species to estimate their abundances and the physical conditions of the gas and the dust throughout the inner circumstellar envelope .      *",
    "our results support the chemical model suggested by w03 and c04 for the polymerization of @xmath5 ; * most of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 are in the inner cse .",
    "the rest come from several dense clumps located in the high velocity gas ; * @xmath7 and @xmath8 are formed in the innermost cse .",
    "their abundances seem to be negligible in the clumps since the emission from these molecules is undetectable in our spectrum ; * we are not able to detect any trace of the @xmath9 band @xmath47 , expected to fall in the observed range .",
    "this implies an even lower abundance for this species compared to previously suggested values .",
    "an upper limit to its column density has been estimated ; * there exist large differences between the excitation temperatures ( vibrational and rotational ) of @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 which indicate that the inner cse is out of lte .",
    "in addition , the results of this work demonstrate the power of ir observations in the determination of the abundances and physical conditions of the gas in complex structured environments such as the innermost envelopes of the evolved stars .",
    "further improvements in the search for @xmath9 will be made in the future by observing crl618 and smp lmc 11 at @xmath226 m with the echelon - cross - echelle spectrograph ( exes ) mounted on the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) .",
