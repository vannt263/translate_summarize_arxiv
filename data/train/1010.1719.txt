    "the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is very dense , filled with condensates made of composite quark and gluon configurations .",
    "these condensates are believed to be at the origin of two of the most prominent nonperturbative phenomena of the strong interaction , namely the generation of hadronic masses and the confinement of color charge .",
    "for example , the formation of the chiral quark condensate , @xmath1@xmath2 per light quark flavor ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and maybe @xmath5 ) , breaks the chiral invariance of the qcd lagrangian and generates constituent light - quark masses of @xmath6mev , compared to the bare quark masses of @xmath7 - 10mev in the lagrangian .",
    "the origin of confinement is less well understood ; an intuitive ( and theoretically viable  @xcite ) picture is that of a dual superconductor , where the condensation of color - magnetic monopoles forces color - electric into quasi - one - dimensional configurations , the color - electric flux tubes ( strings ) generating the confining potential between two static color charges .",
    "since condensates are not directly observable , one has to infer their presence and properties via their excitations . in the qcd vacuum",
    "these are nothing but the hadron spectrum .",
    "a particularly instructive example is the vector ( @xmath8 ) spectral function which is accurately measured in electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_probe ] . ] .     as a function of center - of - mass energy .",
    "right panel : schematic diagram of the phase structure of qcd indicating hadronic matter at low temperature ( @xmath9 ) and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath10 ) , and transitions into a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high @xmath9 and into color - super - conducting ( csc ) phases at high @xmath10 ( small @xmath9 ) . for each of these 3 regions the lowest dimension",
    "quark condensates and expected degrees of freedom are indicated .",
    "the idea is to infer these properties by using the vector spectral function shown in the left panel as a probe.,height=340 ]    the upper panel nicely illustrates a decomposition into a nonperturbative regime at masses below @xmath111.5gev and a perturbative regime above . in the former , the spectral strength is concentrated in the formation of the low - mass vector mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) with dynamical mass while the latter is characterized by a continuum shape whose strength coincides with that of a perturbative @xmath14 final state ( the subsequent formation of the multi - hadron final state appears to have little impact on the cross section ) and @xmath15 families ) prevail , encoding information on the confining force . ] .",
    "an analogous pattern is observed in the spacelike regime ( negative @xmath16 ) , as probed , e.g. , in electron scattering off the proton : jlab data for the @xmath17 structure function  @xcite show a gradual transition from a nucleon - resonance dominated regime at low @xmath18 to a structureless ( perturbative ) continuum for @xmath19gev@xmath20 , in agreement with the universal form measured in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "a central objective in nuclear physics is the exploration of matter aggregates governed by the strong force , i.e. , its phase diagram , schematically depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_probe ] . at high temperature ( and baryon chemical potential )",
    "asymptotic freedom of qcd predicts the bulk medium to be a weakly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons ( modulo colorsuperconducting quark pairing at a cold fermi surface ) .",
    "thus , hadronic spectral functions should be close to their perturbative form , with no more resonant correlations .",
    "for the vector spectral function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_probe ] this implies that the resonance peaks have melted into a structureless continuum ( signaling chiral restoration and deconfinement ) .",
    "a key question is how this transition is realized , in particular when passing through phase changes of the medium .",
    "this is the main idea of vector - meson spectroscopy of hot and dense matter .",
    "the vector channel is unique since it directly couples to ( real and virtual ) photons which can carry undistorted spectral information from the interior of strongly interacting systems in the laboratory ( nuclei , heavy - ion collisions ) : the em mean - free - path is much larger than the system size , @xmath21 .    in the following sections we review calculations of @xmath0-meson spectral functions in hot and dense hadronic matter , discuss their applications to dilepton production experiments in photon - nucleus and ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) , and elaborate connections to thermal lattice qcd .",
    "the final section contains conclusions .",
    "starting point for the description of vector - meson spectral function in hadronic matter is a realistic model in vacuum . for the @xmath0-meson , on which we will focus here , this requires to compute its coupling to 2-pion states to properly describe @xmath22-wave @xmath23 phase shifts and the pion em formfactor in the timelike regime  @xcite .",

    "however , the relatively large @xmath0 3-momenta relative to the nucleus ( @xmath43gev , inherited from the incoming photon energies ) cause a reduction of medium effects since ( a ) a significant portion of @xmath0 s decay outside ( or in the surface region ) of the nucleus , leading to average densities at the decay point of @xmath44 for @xmath45fe , and ( b ) the broadening of the spectral function decreases with increasing 3-momentum  @xcite .",

    "however , in the low - mass region , the thermal dilepton yield is not very sensitive to the boltzmann factor , but rather to the 4-volume of emission .",
    "the latter is much smaller in the qgp than in the hadronic phase , and this is the ultimate reason that qgp emission can not compete with thermal hadronic emission at masses around 0.3gev .",
