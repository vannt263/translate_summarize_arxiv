    "experimental determination of fission barrier height in mass a @xmath2 200 continues to be a challenging problem .",
    "accurate knowledge of fission barrier height is vital not only to understand the heavy ion induced fusion - fission dynamics and prediction of super heavy elements , but also other areas , such as stellar nucleosynthesis and nuclear energy applications as well . in the actinide region ,",
    "the fission barrier heights are comparable to the neutron separation energies and could be determined accurately from the measured fission excitation functions , which exhibit a characteristic rise at the barrier energy followed by a flat plateau . in the a @xmath2 200 mass region ,",
    "fission barrier heights are much higher than the neutron separation energies .",
    "most of the measurement of fission cross sections in this mass region are performed at energies much higher than the fission barrier , where there are other open channels and a statistical description is essential .",
    "although a number of studies have been made , there are still ambiguities in choosing various input parameters for the statistical model analysis . according to the statistical model of compound nucleus decay , the probabilities of decay to different channels",
    "are governed by the transmission coefficient and relative density of states ( phase space ) .",
    "the nuclear level density depends of the level density parameter ( @xmath3 ) related to the single particle density near the fermi surface and the available thermal energy ( u ) .",
    "the ground state shell corrections in the nuclei around the doubly closed shell nucleus @xmath4pb ( z=82 , n=126 ) are large and its damping with excitation energy has to be incorporated properly in the statistical model analysis .",
    "the nuclear level density of a shell closed nucleus shows same energy dependence at high excitation energy ( @xmath5 40 mev ) as that of nuclei away from shell closure , if the excitation energy is measured from the liquid drop surface , indicating the complete washing out of the shell corrections at those energies  @xcite . at intermediate energy",
    "the dependence is phenomenologically described in terms of energy dependent level density parameter approaching asymptotically to the liquid drop value  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological description of gradual damping of the ground state shell correction with excitation energy was obtained by examining the density of neutron resonances situated near the neutron threshold ( @xmath2 8 mev ) .",
    "recently , it has also been studied by measuring evaporation spectra in @xmath4pb region  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge about the shell corrections at the saddle point in a @xmath2 200 is obscure .",
    "the heavy - ion induced fission excitation functions are not sensitive to the correlated variation of the fission barrier height and the ratio of the level density parameter at the saddle point to that at the equilibrium deformation ( @xmath6 )  @xcite . however , the pre - fission neutron multiplicity ( @xmath7 ) data is sensitive to this correlated variation and hence it could be used to constrain the statistical model parameters . however , the measured @xmath7 can have dynamical contribution , which should be taken care of",
    ". analysis @xcite of the fission and evaporation residue cross - sections along with pre - fission neutron multiplicities data for @xmath8c+@xmath9pt system required large shell corrections at the saddle point and yielded fission barriers much smaller ( 13.4 mev ) than those ( @xmath2 22 mev ) obtained for same compound nuclei from the analysis of light ion induced reactions . in the analysis ,",
