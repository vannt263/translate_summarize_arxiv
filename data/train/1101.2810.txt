    "after the recent experiment e821 at the brookhaven national laboratory , a world average of @xcite @xmath9 has been achieved with a precision of 0.54 parts per million .",
    "various groups have computed the theoretical value of @xmath10 in the standard model ( sm ) , i.e. @xmath11 . the uncertainty in computing the @xmath11 is largely coming from the hadronic loop corrections . for a review on the calculational methods and results of @xmath11 ,",

    "the plots we have presented on the allowed parametric space of the parameters , @xmath117 , @xmath116 , @xmath26 and @xmath106 , are for some specific values of the soft parameters and also for some allowed range of the bilinear parameters @xmath67 and @xmath45 . in this sense",

    "but , we have described some generic features of the neutrino masses and the @xmath71 and how they play a part in setting bounds on the model parameters .",
    "specifically , we have found that in the brpv supersymmetric model , depending on the soft parametric values , the constraints due to neutrino masses and the @xmath71 can put certain limits on the parameters @xmath135 , but not on the parameter @xmath117 .",
    "one of the uses of our scanning procedure is that the allowed parametric space we get on the @xmath116 , @xmath26 and @xmath106 , can set upper and lower bounds on the chargino masses of this model .",
    "indeed , given the data from collider experiments , the results of this scanning procedure can be used to probe the supersymmetric particle spectrum of this model .",
