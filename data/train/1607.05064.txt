    "[ prop : ex_infty ] for the considered channel , we have @xmath46 .",
    "consider first the minimization of the quadratic form @xmath47 and note that the @xmath48 matrix with elements @xmath49 , call it @xmath50 , is the @xmath6-fold kronecker power of the @xmath51 matrix @xmath52 as observed by jelinek @xcite , if @xmath53 is a positive semidefinite matrix , so is @xmath50 . in that case",

    "furthermore , in this case the convexity of the quadratic form and the symmetry of @xmath53 imply that the uniform distribution is optimal .",

    "we prove that @xmath65 and then show that @xmath66 , which implies @xmath67 . to prove this , observe that the minimum of @xmath47 is non - decreasing in @xmath68 , and hence for @xmath64 @xmath69 where the last step is obtained using the definition of @xmath70 and equation  ( [ eq : ex_pos_semidef ] ) . to prove that @xmath66",
    ", simply evaluate the function @xmath71 when @xmath72 is the indicator function of shanon s zero - error code of length two for the pentagon .",

    "note in particular that , for @xmath77 , @xmath74 coincides with the simple random coding bound @xcite , while it is infinite for @xmath79 as implied by the known existence of zero - error codes at those rates @xcite .",

    "theorem [ th : gv - lower ] proves that @xmath82 for the considered channel and hence it offers a second disproof of the conjecture , which only uses an elementary extension of the gilbert - varshamov procedure carefully tuned for the particular case at hand .",
    "we finally comment the bound stated in proposition [ prop : straight_line ] showing how it is derived and why it is not trivial to improve it .",
    "for the particular channel considered , the sphere packing bound is essentially trivial ; it states that @xmath83 above capacity , that is @xmath84 , while @xmath85 below capacity . on the other hand ,",

    "finding good upper bounds on @xmath2 in the range @xmath87 appears to be a difficult problem . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the most effective bound to date is obtained as follows .",
    "for @xmath88 at least two codewords are confusable and , from the point of view of these two codewords , the channel is like a binary erasure channel .",
    "hence , in the extreme case when the two codewords are confusable but they differ in all positions , the probability of error is just the probability that all symbols are erased , that is @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that @xmath90 for @xmath88 . using the straight line bound",
    "@xcite we deduce the result of proposition [ prop : straight_line ] .",
    "we observe that we have considered the optimistic condition where all confusable pairs of codewords differ in all possible positions .",
    "this may look too optimistic , but we point out that any sequence is confusable with @xmath91 other sequences which differ in all single position from the considered one .",
    "so , it is not obvious at all how we can improve the bound by reasoning along this line .",
    "we would need to prove that for @xmath88 there are sequences which are both confusable and differ only in a fraction @xmath92 of the positions .",
    "this is precisely what we will do using a linear programming approach in section [ sec : converse - proof ] .",
    "we upper bound the error probability for a random code by using a standard union bound on the probability of confusion among single pairs of codewords .",
    "the code is built using a gilbert - varshamov - like procedure , though we exploit carefully the properties of the channel to add some structure to the random code and obtain better results than just picking random independent codewords .",
    "consider a code with @xmath5 codewords @xmath93 .",
    "let us first consider the probability @xmath94 that a codeword @xmath95 sent through the channel is incorrectly decoded as a second codeword @xmath96 .",
    "this is possible only if the two codewords are confusable , which means that their coordinates are all pairwise confusable . as for the problem of discriminating among these two codewords ,",
    "the channel is equivalent to an erasure channel with erasure probability @xmath0 .",
    "so , the sequence @xmath97 can be incorrectly decoded as sequence @xmath98 only if all differences are erased , which happens with probability @xmath99 .",
    "so , we have @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the hamming distance",
    ". we can rewrite this in a simpler form if we introduce a notion of distance @xmath102 @xmath103 and then extend it additively to sequences in @xmath104 @xmath105 using this definition we can rewrite @xmath106 the average probability of error can then be bounded using the union bound as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the spectrum of the code @xmath109    consider now linear codes of length @xmath110 with @xmath111 generator matrix of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the @xmath114 identity matrix and @xmath115 is a @xmath116 matrix .",
    "we will study the family of random codes obtained when @xmath115 is a random matrix with uniform independent entries in @xmath117 .",
    "note that this corresponds to taking @xmath118 randomly shifted versions of the @xmath6-fold cartesian power of shannon s zero - error code of length 2 @xcite .",
    "since we focus on linear codes , the @xmath108 s take the simpler form @xmath119 , where we set @xmath120 , the weight of the codeword ( and similarly @xmath121 ) .",
    "we now proceed to the study of @xmath122 .",
    "we can decompose any information sequence @xmath123 in two parts , @xmath124 , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "so , for the study of @xmath108 we need only consider the cases @xmath140 .",
    "consider first the case when @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath142 then @xmath143 while if @xmath144 then @xmath145 is infinite .",
    "so , if @xmath141 one choice of @xmath146 gives no contribution to @xmath132 while all other choices lead to @xmath137 , and hence give no contribution to @xmath108 for any finite @xmath147 .",
    "consider then the case of a component @xmath148 .",
    "it is not too difficult to check that one choice of @xmath146 in @xmath149 gives @xmath150 , one gives @xmath151 and @xmath152 or vice - versa , and the remaining one gives @xmath153 .",
    "so , if @xmath148 one choice of @xmath146 contributes @xmath154 to @xmath132 , one choice of @xmath146 contributes @xmath155 , while all other choices lead to @xmath137 , and hence give no contribution to @xmath108 for any finite @xmath147 .",
    "so , for a fixed @xmath156 of hamming weight @xmath157 , and for a fixed @xmath158 , there are @xmath159 vectors @xmath134 which give codewords @xmath160 of weight @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath162 is the number of sequences @xmath163 which lead to a @xmath156 of hamming weight @xmath157 , then we have @xmath164 but @xmath162 is now simply the spectrum of the linear code with generator matrix @xmath115 , and it is known from the gilbert - varshamov procedure that as we let @xmath6 and @xmath165 grow to infinity with ratio @xmath166 , matrices @xmath115 exist for which @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the gilbert - varshamov bound at rate @xmath169 determined implicitly by the relation @xmath170 defining @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , the probability of error is bounded to the first order in the exponent by the largest term in the sum  ( [ eq : sumerlb ] ) as @xmath174 } [ \\log(5)(r-1)+h_2(\\delta)+2\\delta \\\\+\\delta h_2(\\tau)-(\\delta+\\delta\\cdot\\tau ) ] + o(1)\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the maximum over @xmath175 is obtained by maximizing @xmath176 , which gives @xmath177 , independently of @xmath178 .",

    "so , the maximizing @xmath178 is @xmath183 if @xmath184 and @xmath168 otherwise . combining these facts , after some computation we find @xmath185 considering that the block length is @xmath186 and the rate of the global code is @xmath187 , after some simple algebraic manipulations we obtain the claimed bound .",
    "the upper bound we derive here is based on bounding the maximum probability of error over all codewords @xmath188 , which in turn we bound in terms of the minimum distance of codes for the distance measure introduced in the previous section .",
    "note in particular that we have @xmath189 indeed , if there is no pair of confusable codewords , then the inequality is trivial , while if codewords @xmath139 and @xmath190 are confusable , any ( possibly randomized ) decoder will decode in error with probability at least @xmath0 either when codeword @xmath139 or codeword @xmath190 is sent .",
    "so , we can bound the reliability as @xmath191 the rest of this section is devoted to bounding the minimum distance .",
    "in particular we prove that codes for which @xmath192 have rate @xmath193 upper bounded as @xmath194 note that theorem [ th : elp ] follows from equations  ( [ eq : etod])-  ( [ eq : r_lp_rlp ] ) .",
    "our bound is based on @xmath195 functions and delsarte s linear programming bound @xcite , but it is easier to describe it in terms of fourier transforms .",
