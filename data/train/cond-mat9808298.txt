    "it is clearly shown by experimental data that underdoped cuprates exhibit a large suppression of low energy spectral weight at temperatures higher than the superconducting ( sc ) critical temperature , which constitutes the so called pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "early evidence came from a number of probes , such as nmr , infrared reflectivity , and specific heat@xcite , while recent angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments have added qualitatively new information , and attracted considerable attention to this phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the picture that emerges from arpes data is that of a highly anisotropic pseudogap , for @xmath1 , which in magnitude and angular dependence resembles the superconducting gap below @xmath2 and smoothly evolves into it as the temperature is lowered . with increasing underdoping , the interplane anisotropy of these materials increases@xcite",
    ", @xmath3 goes down , and the amplitude of the gap and the temperature @xmath4 , at which the pseudogap opens , increases , thus widening the extent of the pseudogap phase .",
    "moreover the temperature @xmath4 , and the strength of the pseudogap feature , are strongly dependent on the region of the fermi surface that is probed , being quite enhanced close to the @xmath5 point and vanishing along the diagonal direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "these measurements have spawned a number of theoretical interpretations , and no consensus has yet being reached .",
    "theoretical models span a wide range of possible mechanisms , including rvb - like pairing of chargeless spinons@xcite , antiferromagnetic correlations@xcite , and preformed pairs@xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the effects of dimensionality@xcite and intra - plane anisotropy on the properties of the pseudogap .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show under what general conditions an observable pseudogap can be expected as a precursor of superconductivity in the weak to intermediate coupling regime , and to demonstrate the crucial role of both in plane and interplane anisotropy in determining the properties of the pseudogap .",
    "we adopt a procedure for obtaining an analytical estimate of the electron self energy in the renormalized classical regime of the pairing fluctuations , which is similar to the one adopted by vilk et .",
    "this procedure is justifiable up to intermediate coupling .",
    "first we find that a very weak pseudogap exists in the spectral function @xmath6 even in a perfectly isotropic three dimensional ( 3d ) superconductor but it is of a very different nature from the one found in exactly two spatial dimensions , and even very close to the transition temperature it would be practically unobservable at present day resolution . by contrast , for highly anisotropic materials , the size of the pseudogap well above the sc critical temperature becomes almost the same as in the ordered state . therefore ,",
    "unless strong coupling is invoked , a high interplane anisotropy is required to make the pseudogap observable .",
    "the condition for having a strong quasi-2d pseudogap effect in @xmath7 can be expressed as : @xmath8 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the k - dependent value of the zero temperature gap amplitude , and @xmath11 @xmath12 is a dimensional crossover frequency which involves both the interplane anisotropy through the pairing correlation length anisotropy ratio @xmath13 , and the in plane anisotropy of the fermi velocity @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 is the brillouin zone boundary in the direction of the anisotropy axis ) .",
    "second , we find that all the properties of the pseudogap , and in particular its temperature evolution , are strongly affected by the ratio @xmath16 , which depends on the particular point probed on the fermi surface .",
    "we find that this dependence on the in plane anisotropy naturally accounts for the arpes observation of fermi arcs in the pseudogap regime , and also the apparently different line shape and temperature dependence of the pseudogap at different points on the fermi surface .",
    "in particular , we explain the experimental observation that the pseudogap seems to fill up close to the @xmath17  point , and to close in for points close to the zone diagonal .",
    "we evaluate the effects of pairing fluctuations on the electronic self - energy of anisotropic superconductors in the one loop approximation .",
    "the expression for the self energy has the form :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the effective coupling constant@xcite between electrons and pairing fluctuations , @xmath20 the volume of the reciprocal lattice primitive cell , @xmath21 the energy dispersion relative to the chemical potential , and @xmath22 the pairing susceptibility . in this formula and",
    "what follows we have set the in plane lattice constant @xmath23 as the unit of length , the interplane lattice constant as @xmath24 , and we also consider natural units : @xmath25 .    in the critical regime close to the sc instability , the pairing susceptibility @xmath26 is strongly peaked at @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "it is this peak in the pairing susceptibility that gives rise to the pseudogap effect . for the purpose of this work",
    ", it will be sufficient to assume that for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the crossover temperature to the critical regime , @xmath26 can be approximated in the neighborhood of @xmath31 by the following lorentzian form :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the pairing susceptibility for non - interacting electrons at the crossover temperature , @xmath34 is the in plane coherence length , and @xmath35 the microscopic diffusion constant .",
    "two other fundamental quantities appear in this expression : the in plane correlation length @xmath36 which diverges at the transition temperature , and the anisotropy parameter @xmath37 which expresses the interplane anisotropy . in the pairing channel , the expansion for @xmath38 can also contain a real linearly dependent frequency term , @xmath39 .",

    "in which the @xmath43 term is dominant has being considered in references@xcite .    in mean field theory ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath45 diverges as @xmath46 .",
    "however , mean field theory violates the mermin - wagner theorem@xcite , and therefore can not give a viable description of the effects of pairing fluctuations in low dimensional systems .",
    "in order to go beyond mean field theory we will utilize the fluctuation - dissipation theorem :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the local pairing@xcite operator and @xmath49 indicates thermodynamic averaging . in order to satisfy the mermin - wagner theorem , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fluctuationdissipationtheorem ] ) must remain finite ( the mean field assumption leads to a divergence in 2d@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the phase fluctuation scenario consists in having a state with a non - zero local superconducting pairing amplitude , but no off diagonal long range order due to thermal fluctuations in the phase of the order parameter .",
    "it is important to realize that the locally ordered part of the pairing amplitude can not be simply identified with the full correlator in equation ( [ fluctuationdissipationtheorem ] ) because the latter quantity is large and nonzero even in the non - interacting system . in order to make the connection between the local pairing amplitude in the pseudogap regime and the integral of @xmath50",
    ", we first note that monte carlo simulations@xcite show that the temperature dependence of the quantity @xmath51 goes through a minimum at some crossover temperature @xmath30 , and below @xmath30 it increases as if it were in the ordered state . clearly",
    "this growth of the @xmath52 correlator with decreasing temperature is due to the contribution of thermal critical fluctuations .",
    "we thus identify the local superconducting pairing amplitude with the almost singular contribution of the classical fluctuations to the correlator @xmath53 : @xmath54 = \\widetilde{\\delta } _ { cl}^{2}\\left ( t\\right ) \\qquad t < t_{x }   \\label{classicalfluctuations}\\ ] ] where we will assume that @xmath55 has the same temperature dependence as the bcs superconducting gap function and vanishes at the mean field critical temperature @xmath56 .",
    "more specifically , as it will be clear later from the expression for the self - energy in the pseudogap regime , @xmath57 .",
    "we also note that having the crossover temperature to the pseudogap regime of the order of @xmath56 is consistent with _ _  _ _ recent data@xcite which show @xmath58 .",
    "since the largest contribution in the frequency integral comes from @xmath59 in the critical regime ( @xmath60 ) , eq .",
    "( [ classicalfluctuations ] ) can be approximated by :    @xmath61    here @xmath62 is a momentum space cutoff .",

    "unless otherwise stated ( in particular all figures have being generated by choosing @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ) .    from equation ( [ correlationlength ] ) we can find the superconducting transition temperature , by letting @xmath80 :    @xmath81 ^{-1}\\frac{% \\delta ^{2}\\left ( t_{c}\\right ) } { \\delta ^{2}\\left ( 0\\right ) } t_{0 } \\label{criticaltemperature}\\ ] ]    this is still an implicit equation for @xmath3 , but it clearly shows two important points .",
    "first , @xmath82 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath66 , and as the interplane anisotropy increases ( @xmath83 ) , the critical temperature approaches zero logarithmically in @xmath66 , therefore satisfying the mermin - wagner theorem . clearly in this limit ,",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition may set in at some finite temperature , but we will not consider this possibility here and we will assume that the sc critical temperature due to 3d effects is higher then @xmath84 .",
    "second , for any finite value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath85 , @xmath3 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath71 , saturating at @xmath56 for @xmath86 .",
    "that is , in the weak coupling limit , the temperature range of the pseudogap phase is very small even for quasi 2d materials , while for intermediate coupling , the temperature range of the pseudogap phase can be appreciable .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate the imaginary part of the self energy .",
    "close to the sc transition temperature , classical fluctuations give a dominant contribution to the self energy .",
    "we can therefore approximate eq .",
    "( [ generalselfenergy ] ) with its classical part @xmath87 . using ( [ generalselfenergy ] ) , ( [ generalsusceptibility ] ) , and @xcite the imaginary part of the self energy @xmath88 can be evaluated analytically :    @xmath89   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this expression we have taken into consideration only the most important contribution coming from the pole in @xmath26 at @xmath90 . moreover , we expanded the single particle energy up to first order in @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is on the fermi surface and we use inversion symmetry to set @xmath94 ) , and integrated in momentum space using the cutoff @xmath62 .",
    "notice that this momentum integration is essential in order to account for the effect of dimensionality . indeed , neglecting the @xmath91 dependence in the greens function in eq .",

    "the real part of the self energy @xmath96 can be obtained numerically for arbitrary @xmath66 by using the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "notice that in the strictly two dimensional case ( @xmath97 ) , the real and imaginary part of the self energy can both be expressed analytically@xcite .",
    "we will start our study of the effect of dimensionality by analyzing the spectral function when the pseudogap effect is the most noticeable , that is at @xmath99 where the correlation length @xmath100 . at exactly the phase transition",
    "the self - energy is singular , and this leads to a pseudogap at @xmath101 .",
    "however , as we will see below , the qualitative shape of the spectral function and the strength of the pseudogap differ dramatically in 2d and 3d .    in fig.([sf_vf=5_g=0.01.1_t0=1 ] ) the spectral function @xmath102 is plotted for three distinct values of the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath103 ) , with each curve plotted at the respective sc transition temperature @xmath104 , all other parameters being the same . the spectral function in 2d , @xmath105 , is simply given by two sharp peaks located at @xmath106@xcite .",

    ", this may still correspond to a minimum in @xmath162 , but the pseudogap is quickly suppressed as @xmath163 is further reduced from @xmath164 .",
    "figures ( [ sf_g=0_vf=1.20_t0=1].a ) and ( [ sf_g=0_vf=1.20_t0=1].b ) are examples of the temperature evolution of the spectral function provided by this model",
    ".    the dimensional crossover energy , and its relation with the gap amplitude @xmath165 , still determine the behavior of the self energy and hence of the spectral function of the material .",
    "we have already noticed in the previous section that , for @xmath117 and @xmath166 , the self energy of the anisotropic superconductor at the transition temperature @xmath82 coincides with that of the two - dimensional one , and therefore if @xmath167 the values of the spectral function in these two cases coincide except in a narrow range of excitation energies @xmath168 .",
    "this behavior persists as the temperature is increased above @xmath82 .",
    "this is because the correlation length in the third dimension , @xmath169 , decreases much faster ( by a factor of @xmath170 ) than the in plane correlation length @xmath45 , and eventually becomes smaller than the interplane separation @xmath171 , thus reducing the material to a stack of nearly independent two dimensional planes .",
    "therefore , at temperatures high enough that @xmath172 , while still @xmath173 @xmath23 , the relation : @xmath174 is valid for all excitation energies and not only for @xmath175 as we found at @xmath99 .",

    "however in fig .",
    "( [ sf_g=0_vf=1.20_t0=1].a ) another interesting feature is evident : the separation of the peaks as the temperature is increased increases a little at first before it starts to collapse .",
    "it can be shown that this effect is a consequence of our assumption that @xmath199 is given by the bcs expression , which is almost constant at temperatures @xmath200 .",
    "a relaxation of this assumption could eliminate the effect .",
    "further investigation of this effect would require a more accurate model for @xmath199 , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have demonstrated that classical pairing fluctuations give rise to a pseudogap phenomenon in the limit of small to intermediate coupling strength .",
    "however , in both 2d and 3d , the dimensionality plays a crucial role in the strength , shape , and temperature dependence of the pseudogap . in three dimensional isotropic or weakly anisotropic systems ,",
    "the effect is very weak .",
    "the magnitude of the pseudogap just above the transition temperature is reduced from its @xmath201 value at least by a factor of the order of @xmath202 , which in the case of an isotropic superconductor would be of the order of @xmath203 , and its temperature range is quite small .",
    "large values of the coupling strength are therefore necessary to observe a pseudogap in a material with small anisotropy . on the other hand , in two dimensions , or for relatively high anisotropy ,",

    "significantly smaller than @xmath205 , the pseudogap is describable in terms of the two dimensional limit , while for @xmath66 essentially larger than @xmath206 , the anisotropic three dimensional limit is proper .",
    "furthermore , the in plane anisotropy plays a crucial role in determining the temperature range of the pseudogap through the ratio @xmath198 , so that close to the @xmath17 point , the fermi velocity is small ( van hove point ) and @xmath4 is large , while for points on the fermi surface for which the ratio @xmath198 is small , the pseudogap has a smaller range .",
    "the parameters characterizing the underdoped cuprates , namely high anisotropies , large superconducting gap amplitudes , and small correlation lengths , put these materials in the 2d limit , and our results are in rather good qualitative agreement with experiment .",
