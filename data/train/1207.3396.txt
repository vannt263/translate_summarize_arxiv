    "quasars are distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with emission seen across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to x - rays . the optical emission from quasars is thought to be dominated by the radiation from the accretion disk around supermassive black holes , while the radio emission is dominated by the plasma outflowing from the black hole / accretion disk systems .",
    "because of this , different but complementary information can be gathered from both photon energy ranges regarding the cosmological evolution of agn .",
    "it is therefore important to determine in detail the redshift evolutions of quasars in both radio and optical regimes .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",

    "we present the results from a much larger dataset consisting of the overlap of first with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 @xcite quasar catalog , which contains a factor of @xmath2 more objects and spans redshifts from 0.065 to 5.46 .    in the literature ,",

    "this simple form may be modified for optical data by the presence of emission lines , as in this work .",
    "in general , the determination of the lf and its evolution requires analysis of the bi - variate distribution @xmath12 .",
    "the first step of the process should be the determination of whether the variables of the distributions are correlated or are statistically independent .",

    "one must determine not only the correlations between the redshift and individual luminosities ( i.e. the two luminosity evolutions ) but also the possible intrinsic correlation between the two luminosities , before individual distributions can be determined .",
    "knowledge of these correlations and distributions are essential for not only constraining robustly the cosmological evolution of active galaxies , but also for interpretation of related observations , such as the extragalactic background radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a related question is the distribution of the ` radio - loudness parameter ' , @xmath15 , for the quasar population , defined as the ratio of the 5 ghz radio to 2500  optical luminosity spectral densities , and the distinction between so - called ` radio loud ' ( @xmath16 ; rl for short ) and ` radio quiet ' ( @xmath17 ; rq for short ) quasars .",

    "it should be noted that j07 used the sdss data release 3 , so our realization with the same matching criteria , even with the additional @xmath31 magnitude cut and no objects without radio detections , results in more objects ( j07 have 2566 objects ) .",

    ". we will refer to this as the canonical sample , and base our analysis primarily on it , while comparing to results we obtain with the fiducial sample , which as discussed below are quite similar . in the canonical sample 4466 ( 82% ) have @xmath16 .",
    "the major changes from the fiducial catalog to the canonical one are that some optical objects with multiple radio matches in the fiducial sample are reduced to having only single matches in the canonical sample , with a corresponding reduction in radio flux , while a small number of objects drop out entirely , having had multiple matches within @xmath52 but none within @xmath51 .",
    "the fiducial sample and canonical sample are nearly identical in their redshift distribution , and the average radio luminosity differs only slightly , being 10% lower in the canonical sample .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "hereafter r06 , e.g. figure 8 of that work , the sdss optical quasar sample contains significant biases in the redshift distribution due to emission line effects and the differing flux limits at @xmath32 .",
    "we have reduced the later effect by using only the universally flux - limited @xmath31 sample , and the former by adopting the full @xmath55 power law continuum _ plus _ emission line k corrections presented in r06 and discussed in  5 and table 4 of that work .",
    "the methods of this work can then account for any bias resulting from emission line effects , as long as they are included in the conversions from luminosity to flux , i.e. in the k corrections .",

    "figure [ sed ] shows the radio loudness parameter @xmath0 versus redshift for the canonical dataset , while figure [ lvsl ] shows the radio luminosity versus the optical luminosity for different redshift bins .",
    "the lf gives the number of objects per unit comoving volume @xmath57 per unit source luminosity , so that the number density is @xmath58 and the total number is @xmath59 . to examine luminosity evolution , without loss of generality , we can write a lf in some waveband @xmath3 as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe the luminosity evolution and comoving density evolution with redshift respectively and @xmath63 stands for parameters that describe the shape ( e.g. power law indices and break values ) of the @xmath3 band lf . in what follows",
    "we assume a non - evolving shape for the lf ( i.e. @xmath64 const , independent of @xmath65 and @xmath14 ) , which is a good approximation for determining the global evolutions . once the luminosity evolution @xmath61 is determined using the ep method we can obtain the mono - variate distributions of the independent variables @xmath66 and z , namely the density evolution @xmath62 and `` local '' lf @xmath67 .",

    "we have verified the form of equation [ altevolution ] as a good fit to the evolution by considering the optical evolution in the large parent optical only sample in narrow redshift bins with the appropriate simple form of equation [ levolutionold ] and then verifying the form of the cumulative evolution over a larger range .",

    "we would expect that if the truncations and correlations have been properly accounted for by the methods of this work , @xmath79 as determined from the simultaneous radio and optical dataset should match that as determined from the parent optical only dataset , which is shown to be the case ( see  [ evsec ] ) .",
    "we discuss the determination of the evolution factors @xmath72 with the ep method , which in this parameterization becomes a determination of @xmath80 , in ",
    "[ evsec ] . the density evolution function @xmath62 is determined by the method shown  [ dev ] .",

    ", determination of the evolution of the lf of extragalactic sources for any wavelength band except optical involves a tri - variate distribution because redshift determination requires optical observations which introduces additional observational selection bias and data truncation . thus ,",
    "unless redshifts are known for all sources in a radio survey , we need to determine the combined lf @xmath82 from a tri - variate distribution of @xmath14 and the fluxes in the optical and radio bands .",
    "if the optical and radio luminosities were statistically independent variables , then this lf would be separable @xmath83 and we would be dealing with two bi - variate distributions .    however , the luminosities in the different wavebands may be correlated .",
    "the degree and form of the correlation must be determined from the data , and as described below , the ep method allows us to determine whether any pair of variables are independent or correlated .",
    "once it is determined that the luminosities are correlated ( see  [ roevsec ] ) , the question must be asked whether this luminosity correlation is intrinsic to the population , or induced in the data by flux limits and/or similar luminosity evolutions with redshift .",

    "[ evsec ] below , ep also prescribe a method to determine a best fit value for the index @xmath91 which orthogonalizes the new luminosities .",
    "given the correlation function we can then transform the data ( and its truncation ) into the new independent pair of luminosities @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    at the other extreme ,",
    "if the correlation between the luminosities is entirely induced , then the lfs are separable as described above and the analysis can proceed from there . as mentioned , we will consider both possibilities here .",
    "it turns out that the results obtained in both cases are very similar , implying that the luminosity - redshift correlations in the analyzed sample are much stronger than any intrinsic luminosity - luminosity correlations ( if present ) .",
    "further mechanics of the procedure for intrinsically correlated luminosities is discussed in the appendix .    in this work",
    "we are also interested in the distribution of radio loudness parameter @xmath0 , specifically its de - evolved value @xmath94 . in the case of uncorrelated radio and optical luminosities or an induced , non - intrinsic radio - optical luminosity correlation ,",
    "the local distribution of @xmath45 , denoted hereafter as @xmath95 , can be constructed from the local optical and radio luminosity functions as in equation [ gtrue ] , with the redshift evolution function    @xmath96    in the case of an intrinsic radio - optical luminosity correlation , @xmath97 and the evolution @xmath98 can be constructed by equations [ localr ] and [ rexp ] given in the appendix .",

    "for all these reasons , we believe that applying a universal @xmath51 matching radius criterion in assigning first counterparts to the sdss bona fide _ quasar _ sources is more appropriate , while @xmath52 criterion for multiple matches has a high probability of including radio flux from objects unrelated to the optical quasar that they are supposedly linked to .",
    "quasars are seen to exhibit positive luminosity evolution in both wavebands , with stronger positive evolution in radio than optical .",
    "the differential evolution can be seen in the evolution of @xmath205 as shown in figure [ psir ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the results presented for a combined firstxposs - i dataset in qp1 , but in likely disagreement with j07 which claimed that the fraction of rl quasars decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "however , @xcite have noted that the fraction of rl quasars may increase with redshift and @xcite reached the same conclusion by computing radio and optical lfs at different redshifts .",
    "@xcite also found that the rl fraction of quasars may modestly increase at high redshift , and the conclusions of @xcite favor @xmath0 increasing with redshift .",
    "we note that a trend toward increasing radio loudness with redshift is visible to the eye even in the raw observed data as in figure [ lvsl ] , although this data suffers from biases so that the true evolution of @xmath0 can only be recovered with an analysis method such as employed here .",
    "we attribute our apparent disagreement with the j07 result to three causes : 1 ) they present one particular moment of the @xmath0 distribution  the``radio loud fraction ''  in bins , while we are presenting the distribution itself , so direct comparison is rather difficult , 2 ) they are calculating this fraction by including optical sources that have no radio detection , which is a potentially correctable bias , and 3 ) they are not including the effect of neglecting sources that are radio bright enough to appear in first but do nt appear in the sdss quasar sample that they use .",
    "there are potentially many agn sources in the first catalog that are not present in the sdss quasar sample , due to their low optical fluxes .",
    "the sample used in j07 to calculate the radio loud fraction in bins would be missing this population of sources with detectable radio emission but lower optical fluxes than would allow an sdss detection or classification as a quasar source , while we have used an analysis which takes both flux limits properly into account .",
    "while for the joint dataset the present work has used only quasars detected in both radio and optical and including both optical - color - selected and radio - match - selected sources , j07 used as their sample quasars detected in optical regardless of a radio detection and their quasars were selected based solely on optical color .",
    "stepping back , there are four basic options when constructing a combined optical - radio dataset of quasars for an analysis of the radio loudness distribution and its evolution , given that many more confirmed quasars have an optical detection than a radio one :    i. quasars detected in both radio and optical    \\ii .",
    "quasars detected in optical regardless of a radio detection    a. optical quasar candidates selected for followup based on either optical colors or presence of a radio match    b. optical quasar candidates selected for followup based only on optical colors    under the above rubric , we have used ia for the joint radio - optical dataset , while j07 used iib .",
    "we believe that while using option ii is appropriate to investigate the optical luminosity function and its evolution , such a dataset is not appropriate for investigating the radio loudness distribution and its evolution . this is because with such a dataset one will always be introducing a bias by not including objects bright in radio but dim in optical , and at the same time , not being able to say if such a population exist at all by means of some censored data method",
    ". the situation could be different if one were able to select two quasar samples based separately on the radio and optical data , down to given radio and optical flux limits of the surveys , and then to match the two samples forming a master - list with both radio and optical fluxes provided for each object included . only then",
    "non - detections in either radio or optical bands could be considered , and the censored data method could be applied ( see in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however since an optical identification is needed to claim a quasar nature of a source the first place , this is not possible , so in using an only optically detected set one will be always biased against a radio - loud population . on the other hand , if , as in the present work , one uses option i , and then analyzes the data in such a way as to take the flux limits into account , an unbiased reconstruction of the intrinsic properties of the population can be achieved .    the question of whether option a or b is most appropriate is less straightforward",
    "however , quasar optical color may be correlated with radio loudness @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , then by selecting quasars based on the optical colors solely , one may introduce some bias when dealing with the radio loudness distribution and evolution .",
    "option ia means that the color criterion is not important : by including only those quasars which are detected in radio , and by allowing for radio - selected optical quasar candidates , we basically end up with a radio - selected ( and not color - selected ) and radio and optical flux limited sample of quasars .",
    "our results favor a single population of quasars with no bi - modality in the radio loudness parameter for the range of @xmath0 considered here , in agreement with the conclusions of qp1 .",
    "some physical implications of a single population in this range of @xmath0 are discussed in that work , including that there is thus no evidence for the existence of two physically different population of quasars with respect to the radio / jet production efficiency .",
    "although it is a somewhat different issue , there have also been studies of radio populations investigating the distribution of quasars , seyferts , and other types of agn in the plane of radio loudess versus accretion rate ( note that by definition all the quasars accrete at high and very high rates , unlike radio galaxies or seyferts ) .",
    "these results indicate that there may be two ` tracks ' in the space , characterized by a similar non - monotonic dependence of the radio loundess parameter on the eddington ratio , but differing in normalization , and corresponding to what might be considered as a rl population hosted exclusively by elliptical galaxies , and a rq population of agn hosted by both types of galaxies @xcite .",
    "such studies were however done  and in fact had to be done  on incomplete and inhomogeneous samples of agn , and were claimed to depend on whether core or total radio luminosities are used ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the host - related bimodal distribution of radio loudness in the entire agn population is however distinct from the main problem addressed in this work , dealing strictly with a well - defined population of quasar - type agn ( for which , notably , we use the first  i.e. the total  radio fluxes ) . and in particular , the conclusion that there is no radio bimodiality for the quasar population does not contradict the findings presented in @xcite , as these authors emphasized that while a complete sample of elliptical - hosted agn ( including quasars ) is expected to show continuous distribution of the radio loudness down to the `` radio quiet '' regime , the point is that the spiral - hosted agn do never reach high values of the radio - loudness parameters ( i.e. , values comparable to those of radio galaxies ) , even though at very low accretion rates they are often characterized by @xmath230 ( see section 3 of that work and the discussion therein ) .",
    "in  [ rdist ] we explored additional arguments against the presence of a bi - modality in @xmath0 at lower values of @xmath0 , below those considered in this analysis .",
    "the caution to the above conclusion is that the sample analyzed here is dominated by rl objects , as we do not , for the reasons discussed above , consider sdss quasars with no detected first counterparts .",
    "figure [ lvsl ] indicates that with this sdss @xmath25 first dataset we are sensitive to regions where additional rq objects would lie were they to exist ( e.g. below the @xmath208 line and above the @xmath231 lines in that figure ) but there does not appear to be an overabundance of those objects .",
    "however , we can not formally exclude the possibility that there may be a population of very radio quiet quasars which would form a separate branch in figure [ psir ] were the abscissa extended to the left , resulting in a bi - modal distribution of radio loudness for the entire quasar population .",
    "such a numerous population of very radio - quiet quasars , even if absent in the first database , would not be missed in deeper radio surveys probing sub - mjy flux levels .",
    "in fact , @xcite have used evla observations to detect 179 sdss dr7q quasars in the range @xmath232 in their field down to a 6 ghz flux limit of 20 @xmath233jy .",
    "they claim to detect almost every quasar ( 97% ) in the field in radio , and construct the 6 ghz radio luminosity function with the @xmath234 method .",
    "their radio luminosity function is well fit with two populations , one with radio emssion dominated by agn central engine emsision , and one with radio dominated by star formation .",
    "the later becomes prominent at luminosities below @xmath235 erg s@xmath28 hz@xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to radio luminosities just below those probed in this analysis , as can be seen in figure [ psirad ] , and would imply a two population model with the more rq population dominating at @xmath236 and below , although without a dip at @xmath194 .",
    "@xcite claim no bimodality in the @xmath237 radio loudness parameter with x - ray selected sample with @xmath238 down to @xmath239 mjy .",
    "the @xcite result disfavors a large population with values of @xmath0 below @xmath240 that would cause a bi - modality in @xmath0 , based on a volume - limited sample probed to low radio fluxes .",
    "both of these works claim evidence for a low radio flux population of quasars where the radio emission is significantly enhanced or even dominated by star formation activity in the host galaxies .",
    "this is largely a different issue than the `` traditional '' bimodality question in quasars , i.e. as to whether there is a two - component shape to the radio loudness distribution centered around @xmath208 .    the measured @xmath241 distribution of extragalactic radio sources at low fluxes , together with the limiting level of the extragalactic radio background @xcite and the quasar optical lf",
    "as constructed here , could in principle provide further constrains on the distribution of the radio - loudness parameter at very low values of @xmath0 .",
