    "the higgs sector in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model contains charged higgs - bosons as well as additional neutral higgs - bosons @xcite . among the latter is a pseudoscalar particle usually denoted @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the production cross section for the @xmath0 in the process @xmath1 .",
    "contributions to this process arise from triangle and box diagrams .",
    "the triangle contributions consist of diagrams in which the @xmath0 and photon are on - shell external particles and the remaining particle is a virtual photon or @xmath4 in the @xmath5-channel . since @xmath6 is in the physical region , the photon pole contribution dominates the @xmath4 pole contribution in this set of diagrams @xcite .",
    "moreover , because of the off - diagonal structure of the @xmath0 couplings to other bosons , the particles in the loop are either quarks , leptons or charginos . here",
    ", we present the top quark , bottom quark , tau lepton and the two chargino contributions to the photon pole amplitude .",
    "the box diagrams have a more complex particle structure , with leptons , charginos , neutralinos and scalar leptons in the loops . like the @xmath4 pole ,",
    "these diagrams are non - singular at @xmath6 , and should not contribute a sizable correction to the photon pole terms .",
    "they are not included in the present calculation .",

    "the chargino coupling constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the elements of two @xmath27 unitary matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 which diagonalize the chargino mass matrix @xmath30 , where @xcite @xmath31 and are chosen to ensure that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive . for illustrative purposes , we assume that the symmetry breaking parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real and consider two cases : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the couplings in these cases are @xmath36 for @xmath34 , and @xmath37 for @xmath35 . notice that , these couplings are symmetric in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and , unlike the @xmath0-top coupling",

    "the presence of the @xmath48 in eq.([msq ] ) means it is necessary to introduce a cutoff in the calculation of the total cross section .",
    "one approach to obtaining a finite cross section is use the effective photon or weizscker - williams approximation for the exchanged photon @xcite .",
    "here , we integrate the exact amplitude and impose an angular cutoff . the expression for the total cross section",
    "is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an angular cutoff .",
    "we investigated the effect of varying @xmath51 by comparing the standard model cross section with and without the @xmath4 exchange .",
    "for @xmath52 as large as @xmath53 , the @xmath4 contribution is only 3%-4% of the total .",
    "the result scales approximately as the logarithm of @xmath50 , and we use @xmath54 in the figures .    to complete the calculation of the cross section for the @xmath55 process , it is necessary to fold the cross section , eq.([sigma ] ) , with the distribution @xmath56 of backscattered photons having momentum fraction @xmath57 @xcite to obtain @xmath58 with @xmath59 . here",
    ", we have taken the usual upper limit on the allowed @xmath57 value , @xmath60 .",
    "this cross section is plotted in fig.(1 ) for @xmath34 and in fig.(2 ) for @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed line in each panel is the contribution from the top and bottom quarks and the tau lepton . for large @xmath24 ,",
    "the tau contribution is important .",
    "this is illustrated in the @xmath61 panel of fig.(1 ) , where the dot - dashed line is the contribution from the top and bottom quarks . in fig.(1 ) , the solid lines are @xmath62 gev and @xmath21 the largest value consistent with the constraint @xmath63 , which is needed to ensure that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real . similarly , in fig.(2 ) , the solid lines correspond to @xmath62 gev and @xmath21 the largest value consistent with @xmath64 . unlike the @xmath34 case , when @xmath35 it is possible for @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be equal for @xmath65 provided the @xmath66 .",
    "these values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are within the range of chargino masses found in studies of minimal supersymmetric models @xcite . in most cases",
    ", the inclusion of the chargino contribution leads to a significant increase in the cross section , especially for the larger values of @xmath24 .    to assess the observability of this process , we assume that the dominant @xmath67 decay is @xmath68 . for @xmath69 , this ignores some contribution from chargino pair decay , but this is relatively small since in all but one of the examples we consider the lowest chargino mass exceeds @xmath70 gev .",
    "even above the top threshold , @xmath71 decay dominates when @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are the cross section for the direct production of a background @xmath71 of invariant mass @xmath73 in @xmath74 collisions subject to an angular cut on the @xmath75 and @xmath76 direction relative to the that of the incident photon in the @xmath74 center of mass .",
    "we find that an angular cut of @xmath77 on both the @xmath75 and the @xmath76 reduces the background @xmath71 cross section by about a factor of 10 while leaving the @xmath71 signal from @xmath0 decay essentially unchanged .",
    "more restrictive cuts on the @xmath75 and @xmath76 angles can further suppress the background , but at the expense of a significant decrease in the signal @xcite .",
    "the cut shown appears to be optimal .",
    "we would like to point out that the @xmath55 cross sections calculated here are very likely to be much larger than those of the related process @xmath78 at 500 gev .",
    "we have checked this for the production of the standard model higgs - boson using the complete ( standard model ) calculation of @xmath79 @xcite and the photon pole contribution to @xmath80 . at an @xmath81 center of mass energy of 500 gev",
    ", we find the cross section @xmath82 for the production of a 200 gev @xmath83 is 0.08 fb , whereas @xmath84 fb for the same higgs - boson mass .",
    "this enhancement is implicit in a previous calculation of scalar higgs - boson production @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the weizscker - williams approximation is used for the @xmath5 channel photon together with the on - shell @xmath85 amplitude .",
    "this is essentially equivalent to setting @xmath86 in the parentheses of eq.([sigma ] ) and using @xmath87 as the cutoff in the remaining integral @xcite .",
    "our comparison of the approximate results of ref.@xcite with an exact calculation suggests that the weizscker - williams approach tends to overestimate the cross section .",
    "apart from minor variations depending on how the calculation is performed , it is nevertheless true that the @xmath5 channel cross section is substantially larger than its @xmath88 channel counterpart .",
    "the production of @xmath0 has also been investigated in @xmath89 collisions @xcite . in this case , the background arises from the process @xmath90 and it is effectively suppressed by imposing an angular cut . with our choice of chargino masses , a comparison of the @xmath61",
    "cross sections in @xmath74 production and @xmath89 production @xcite reveals a larger signal in the @xmath91 mode .",
    "both channels are likely to be important in searches for the @xmath0 .    to the extent that the photon pole contribution can be isolated , this method of searching for the @xmath0 has the advantage that the contributions from supersymmetry are significant and limited to one type supersymmetric particle .",
    "should one observe a cross section larger than any standard model prediction , the case for the presence of chargino contributions is rather strong .",
