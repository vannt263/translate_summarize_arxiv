    "anisotropic flows in heavy ion collisions @xcite , which have been studied extensively at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( ) , are sensitive to the properties of produced matter .",
    "this sensitivity not only exists in the larger elliptic flow tean , kolb , huov , zhang99,moln1,lin:2001zk , gyulv2,voloshin03 but also in the smaller higher - order anisotropic flows kolb99,teaney99,kolb00,kolb03,star03,chen04,kolb04 .",
    "furthermore , scaling relations among hadron anisotropic flows are observed in the experimental data @xcite , and they are shown in theoretical models to relate to similar scaling relations among parton elliptic flows @xcite .",
    "these studies have , however , mainly focused on hadrons at mid - rapidity where odd - order anisotropic flows vanish in collisions of equal mass nuclei .",
    "recently , anisotropic flows at finite pseudorapidities have also been measured in au + au collisions at .",
    "the experimental results show that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend strongly on the rapidity star03,phobos02,manly03,tonjes04,oldenburg04,back04 , and this has so far not been reproduced by theoretical models @xcite .",
    "these new experimental data thus offer the opportunity to test the validity of theoretical models and to study the dynamics and properties of produced matter at large rapidity in heavy ion collisions at .    in the present work , we shall use a multi - phase transport ( ) model , that includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions @xcite , to study the pseudorapidity dependence of anisotropic flows @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 of charged hadrons in heavy - ion collisions at .",
    "both the default version and the version with string melting , i.e. , allowing hadrons that are expected to be formed from initial strings to convert to their valence quarks and antiquarks @xcite , will be used .",
    "the latter was able to explain the measured @xmath4 dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3 of mid - rapidity charged hadrons with a parton scattering cross section of about @xmath6 .",
    "we find in the present study that the same parton cross section fails to reproduce recent data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 at large pseudorapidity in au + au collisions at @xmath7 .",
    "these data are explained instead by the default scenario without string melting .",
    "our results thus suggest that a pure partonic matter is formed only near midrapidity during the early stage of these collisions , and the matter at large pseudorapidity remains dominated by strings .",
    "we also give predictions on the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 at forward pseudorapidity .",
    "the model @xcite is a hybrid model that uses minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes in the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( ) model @xcite as the initial conditions for modeling heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "time evolution of resulting minijet partons is then described by zhang s parton cascade ( ) @xcite model . at present , this model includes only parton - parton elastic scatterings with an in - medium cross section given by : @xmath11where the strong coupling constant @xmath12 is taken to be @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the effective screening mass @xmath16 depends on the temperature and density of the partonic matter but is taken as a parameter in for fixing the magnitude and angular distribution of parton scattering cross section .",
    "after minijet partons stop interacting , they are combined with their parent strings , as in the model with jet quenching , to fragment into hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model as implemented in the program @xcite .",
    "the final - state hadronic scatterings are then modeled by a relativistic transport ( ) model @xcite .",
    "the default model @xcite has been quite successful in describing measured rapidity distributions of charge particles , particle to antiparticle ratios , and spectra of low transverse momentum pions and kaons @xcite in heavy ion collisions at the super proton synchrotron ( ) and .",
    "it has also been useful in understanding the production of @xmath17 @xcite and multistrange baryons @xcite in these collisions .    since the initial energy density in au + au collisions at",
    "is much larger than the critical energy density at which the hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma transition would occur @xcite , the model has been extended to convert the initial excited strings into partons @xcite . in this string melting scenario , hadrons ( mostly pions ) , that would have been produced from string fragmentation , are converted instead to valence quarks and/or antiquarks with current quark masses .",
    "interactions among these partons are again described by the parton cascade model .",
    "since there are no inelastic scatterings , only quarks and antiquarks from the melted strings are present in the partonic matter .",
    "the transition from the partonic matter to the hadronic matter is then achieved using a simple coalescence model , which combines two nearest quark and antiquark into mesons and three nearest quarks or antiquarks into baryons or anti - baryons that are close to the invariant mass of these partons .",
    "the present coalescence model is thus somewhat different from the ones recently used extensively @xcite for studying hadron production at intermediate transverse momenta . using parton scattering cross sections of @xmath18-@xmath6 , the model with string melting is able to reproduce both the centrality and transverse momentum ( below @xmath19 @xmath20 ) dependence of the elliptic flow lin:2001zk and pion interferometry @xcite measured in au+au collisions at @xmath21 at ackermann:2000tr , starhbt01 .",
    "it has also been used for studying the kaon interferometry in these collisions @xcite .",
    "we note that the above cross sections are significantly smaller than that needed to reproduce the parton elliptic flow from the hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "the resulting hadron elliptic flows in the model with string melting are , however , amplified by modeling hadronization via quark coalescence molnar03 , leading to a satisfactory reproduction of experimental data .",
    "and @xmath22  in central au+au collisions at @xmath23  agev .",
    "solid curves are from default ampt model , while dotted and dashed curves are from ampt model with string melting using parton cross section @xmath24  mb and 10 mb , respectively",
    ". experimental data from the brahms collaboration @xcite are squares for pions and triangles for kaons . ]",
    "we first show in fig.[pty ] the pion and kaon transverse momentum spectra at rapidity @xmath25 and @xmath22 in central au+au collisions at @xmath7 agev . compared to experimental data from the brahms collaboration brahms , shown by squares for pions and triangles for kaons ,",
    "the default model shown by solid curves reproduces them well , but the model with string melting , on the other hand , gives a smaller inverse slope parameter for both parton cross sections of @xmath26 mb ( dotted curves ) and @xmath6 mb ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the reason that hadron transverse momentum spectra are softened in the string melting scenario is due to a softer initial parton spectra obtained from converting hadrons to quarks and antiquarks , and the small current quark masses that make their transverse momentum spectra less affected by radial collective flow than hadrons in the default model . since",
    "hadron anisotropic flows are given by ratios of hadron momentum distributions in the transverse plane , the model with string melting is expected to give a reliable prediction @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flows @xmath27 of particles are the fourier coefficients in the decomposition of their transverse momentum spectra in the azimuthal angle @xmath28 with respect to the reaction plane @xcite , i.e. , @xmath29   \\label{dndphi}\\]]because of the symmetry @xmath30 in the collision geometry , no sine terms appear in the above expansion . for particles at midrapidity in collisions with equal mass nuclei ,",
    "anisotropic flows of odd orders vanish as a result of the additional symmetry @xmath31 .",
    "the anisotropic flows generally depend on particle transverse momentum and rapidity , and for a given rapidity the anisotropic flows at transverse momentum @xmath4 can be evaluated according to @xmath32where @xmath33 denotes average over the azimuthal distribution of particles with transverse momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the anisotropic flows @xmath27 can further be expressed in terms of the single - particle averages : @xmath34where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the projections of particle momentum in and perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "from minimum bias events of au + au collisions at @xmath37  agev in the string melting scenario with parton scattering cross sections @xmath38  ( open squares ) and @xmath6  ( solid squares )  mb as well as the scenario without string melting ( triangles ) .",

    "[ v1yh ] , we show the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath0 for charged hadrons from minimum bias events of au + au collisions at @xmath39 by using the string melting scenario with parton scattering cross sections @xmath26 ( open squares ) and @xmath6 ( solid squares ) and the scenario without string melting ( default model , triangles ) . also included in fig .",
    "[ v1yh ] are recent data from the star collaboration ( circles ) @xcite .",
    "both scenarios can reproduce approximately the data around the mid - pseudorapidity region , i.e. , @xmath0 is flat ( essentially zero ) around mid-@xmath40 . for @xmath0 at large @xmath41 , the string melting scenario with both parton scattering cross sections @xmath26 and @xmath6 underestimates significantly the data . on the other hand , the scenario without string melting seems to give a good description of @xmath0 at large @xmath41 .",
    "our results thus indicate that the matter produced at large @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) at initially consists of mostly strings instead of partons .",

    "[ v2yh ] , together with preliminary data from the phobos collaboration ( stars ) @xcite and the star collaboration ( circles ) @xcite .",
    "one sees that the string melting scenario with @xmath44 @xmath6 ( solid squared ) describes very well the data on @xmath1 around mid-@xmath40 ( @xmath45 ) while it overestimates the data at large pseudorapidity .",
    "surprisingly , the calculated results with @xmath44 @xmath6 are similar to the prediction from the hydrodynamic model that includes the `` thermalization coefficient '' correction @xcite .",
    "the overestimation of @xmath1 for charged hadrons at large pseudorapidity ( @xmath46 ) obtained with @xmath44 @xmath6 may be due to the constant parton scattering cross section used in the calculations .",
    "as shown in eq.([crscp ] ) , the parton scattering cross section depends on the gluon screening mass and is thus temperature and density dependent . since the dynamics of partonic matter at different rapidities may not be the same in heavy ion collisions at",
    ", different parton cross sections may have to be used .",
    "comparison between theoretical results and the experimental data on elliptic flow indicates that a larger @xmath44 @xmath6 is needed at midrapidity but a smaller @xmath44 @xmath22 ( open squares ) gives a better description at large pseudorapidity .",

    "[ vnpte4 ] ( a ) is non - zero and changes from negative to positive values at a balance transverse momentum of about @xmath54 /_c_. this feature implies that charged hadrons with lower and higher transverse momentum move preferentially towards the negative and positive transverse flow direction , respectively , consistent with that seen in the hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
