    "among biopolymers , gelatin gels have received great attention @xcite because of their numerous applications in pharmaceutical , photographic and food industries . when a semi - diluted gelatin solution is cooled below room temperature ,",
    "the coils start to form triple helices and progressively a connected network is built .",
    "the triple helices are reminiscent of the structure of native collagen , which gave origin to gelatin by means of a denaturation process .",
    "the gel is thermoreversible , i.e. by raising the temperature the sol state is recovered .",
    "biodiversity due to chemical composition of the native collagen , molecular weight distribution , solution properties such as concentration or ph , influences the temperature of helix formation in the physical gel @xcite .",
    "the shear modulus shows universal scaling behavior with a critical exponent @xmath0 close to 2 versus the distance from the critical concentration of helices @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gelatin solutions show an even richer phenomenology since chemical gelation or a combination of chemical and physical gelation can be observed . in fact",
    ", if the system is kept above the helix formation temperature , amino - acids present along the gelatin chain can react with cross - linking molecules added to the solution . in this case",
    "helices can not form and a permanent network appears due to cross - links between reactant and chains , leading to the onset of an elastic response . recently",
    ", extended studies have been performed on systems of gelatin in solution with bisvinylsulphonemethyl ( bvsm ) reactant @xcite , able to establish double covalent bonds with the lysine , the hydroxylysine and possibly with other amine groups of gelatin chains .",
    "the chemical reaction is schematically shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the influence of various parameters , as gelatin or reagent concentration and solution ph , on bond formation was investigated .",
    "for instance , increasing the ph activates more amine groups able to react with bsvm along the gelatin chains .",
    "microcalorimetry measurements were able to monitor the development of the chemical reaction in time by detecting the exothermic enthalpy change during the formation of @xmath1 bonds .",
    "then the kinetics of cross - link formation was found to follow a double exponential decay with two characteristic times , whereas a simple exponential decay was detected at low ph .    however , when counting the number of cross - links binding bvsm and gelatin , the method could not discriminate between bonds established by free reactants with a chain and bonds leading to a bridge between two gelatin chains , nor else bonds leading to a loop within a chain .",
    "this lack of information on the kinetics leading to the gel formation crucially affects the characterization of the gel structure and therefore its mechanical properties .",
    "finally it may reflect onto the location of the gelation threshold and the determination of the critical exponent of the elastic modulus ( the critical behavior of the shear modulus was measured at low frequency , giving a critical exponent @xmath2@xcite , close to the expected value for the vulcanization of long chains ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a deeper comprehension of the bond formation kinetics is essential , requiring alternative investigations .",
    "in particular the primary question is to understand how the two time scales controlling the kinetics depend on the formation of single - bonds and bridges between the cross - linkers and the chains , or else to loops within the chains .",
    "moreover it would be crucial to understand how these time scales are related to the properties of the gelatin solution ( concentration , ph ... ) and of the cross - linking molecules ( concentration , reactivity ... ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the role of concentration and reactivity of cross - linking molecules in the kinetics of bond formation , by complementing the experimental observations with a numerical study . in gelling systems numerical approaches to the study of rheological and dynamical properties have revealed to be extremely useful for a better understanding of experimental data @xcite .",
    "both monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations have been applied in the last years to the study of different chemical gelation processes @xcite .",
    "here we have used monte carlo simulations on the cubic lattice of a simple model to analyze the kinetics of bond formation in chemical cross - linking of a gelatin solution .",
    "we have considered a solution of polymer chains at different concentrations .",
    "reactant monomers can diffuse in the solution forming bonds with the active sites along the chains , producing the cross - linking . within this approach",
    "we have followed the kinetics of the gel formation varying the gelatin concentration , the cross - linker concentration and its bonding probability ( i.e. reactivity ) .",
    "our data reproduce extremely well the experimental findings .",
    "they show that the two time scales detected in the experiments correspond respectively to the average time of forming single bonds reactant - chains and bridges chains - chains via cross - linkers .",
    "the ratio of these two characteristic times controls the kinetics of the bond formation : varying the concentration and the cross - linker reactivity strongly affect this ratio and therefore the kinetics of the gelation process .    the paper is organized as follows : in sect.[exp ] the results of microcalorimetry measurements are presented , whereas in section [ num ] the numerical study is described and the results on bond formation are discussed .",
    "finally in section [ bond ] the kinetics of bond formation is analyzed and the concluding remarks are given in section [ conclu ] .",
    "in experiments , the kinetics of the reaction between amine groups of gelatin chains and bvsm has been monitored by microcalorimetry measurements .",
    "the gelatin sample is a photographic grade of gelatin extracted from lime processed ossein with an average molecular weight @xmath3 , an index of polydispersity @xmath4 and an isoelectric point @xmath5 .",
    "the granules contain approximately @xmath6 humidity and the concentrations are corrected accordingly .",
    "the bvsm can create covalent @xmath1 bonds with amine groups of gelatin chains , so that a permanent network is formed at @xmath7 , where the triple helices structure of gelatin gels does not form .",
    "d. hellio - serughetti and m. djabourov @xcite analyzed the relation between elastic properties and system parameters was analyzed .",
    "the exothermal reaction between amine groups and bvsm has been monitored by measuring the enthalpy change .",
    "we have performed several experiments at temperature @xmath8 , using solutions with different concentrations of gelatin and reactant , for different values of ph . in fig.[fig2 ] we plot the released heat @xmath9 as a function of time for a solution with gelatin concentration @xmath10 , bvsm concentration @xmath11 and @xmath12 . normalizing the released heat by the enthalpy change @xmath13 due to the formation of one @xmath1 bond , the curve represents at any time the total number of bonds formed between gelatin chains and bvsm .    ,",

    ", width=340 ]    it is worth to notice that microcalorimetry experiments do not allow to discriminate between single - bonds and bridges or loops within a chain , where only bridges between different chains contribute to the increase of connectivity in the system . for this reason computer simulations are a fundamental step for a deeper understanding of the kinetics of bonds formation .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations on a cubic lattice of a system made of bi - functional monomers , i.e. the reactant and linear chains , which are represented by a sequence of @xmath26 linked monomers .",
    "one monomer of the chain models a kuhn segment @xcite , and therefore represents more units .",
    "the length of a kuhn segment in a gelatin chain has been measured @xcite to be of the order of @xmath27  , corresponding to about @xmath28 amino - acids .",
    "as compared to the experiments , our chains correspond to shorter gelatin chains , containing only about @xmath29 amino - acids .",
    "each monomer occupies simultaneously the eight sites of the lattice elementary cell and , to take into account the excluded volume interaction , two occupied cells can not have any site in common .",
    "some monomers along the chain are active sites which may bind to the reactant in order to compose complex clusters of chains leading to the formation of a gel .",
    "the active sites are tetra - functional .",
    "two bonds are formed with the neighbors along the chain and two are not saturated at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "the number of active sites per chain , @xmath30 , corresponds to a fixed ph of the solution .",
    "in fact , in experiments the increasing of the ph activates more amine groups able to react with the bvsm along the chain , therefore in simulations @xmath30 could be varied to study the effect of the ph .",
    "although the number of amine groups in a gelatin chain actually linked to reactant can not be measured experimentally , it is estimated that at most a fraction of @xmath31 can react .",
    "therefore we have performed most of the simulations for @xmath32 , which corresponds to a fraction of @xmath6 of active amino - acids in our chain .",
    "chains are randomly distributed on the lattice and diffuse via random local movements . the excluded volume interaction and the self avoiding walk condition for polymer clusters restrict the possibility of monomer movements : to satisfy these two requirements the bond lengths vary into a set of permitted values according to bond - fluctuation dynamics @xcite . on a cubic lattice",
    "the allowed bond lengths are @xmath33 . at each monte carlo step the time is increased by @xmath34 and one random move is selected on average for each monomer : if the move satisfies the bond - fluctuation dynamics and excluded volume conditions , it is executed , otherwise it is rejected . these simple laws for local movements give rise to a dynamics which takes into account the main features of the real dynamics of polymer molecules @xcite .    after chains have diffused and reached equilibrium , we add the reactant to the system and let the solution diffuse towards the stationary state .",
    "due to the diffusion of cross - linkers and chains , when a reactant finds a nearest neighbor unsaturated active site , a bond may form .",
    "the process goes on until all the possible bonds are formed .",
    "the bond formation may request to overcome a free energy barrier @xcite , depending on the nature of the solution , the active sites and the reactant .",
    "in particular , it may depend on some specific local orientation of the molecules , some restriction on the value of the angle between two bonds , due to the rigidity of the @xmath1 link , or else may be affected by variations of the effective reactivity of the cross - linker . in our model",
    "we have taken into account these effects in the following way : the first bond of a reactant monomer is formed along lattice directions as soon as there is a neighboring active site .",
    "the second bond is formed with probability @xmath35 , since a reactant monomer is expected to have less chance to react when is already bonded to a chain , compared to when it is free . in the same spirit of reaction",
    "limited aggregation models @xcite , @xmath36 is an independent parameter which influences the time of formation of bridges between gelatin active sites .",
    "the value of @xmath36 should be determined by the features of cross - linking reagent . moreover , although varying the bridge probability @xmath36 does not affect the gelation transition , it has a crucial effect on the velocity of the reaction , which can be easily enlightened in the numerical simulation as discussed later .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the model for different lattice sizes ( @xmath37 ) , where the unit length is the lattice spacing @xmath38 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the chain concentration @xmath39 and the cross - linker concentration @xmath40 are defined as the ratio between the number of monomers / reactant and the maximum number of monomers @xmath41 in the system .",
    "using the percolation approach we identify the gel phase as the state in which there is a percolating cluster , which spans the whole system @xcite . for a fixed set of parameters we generate a number of configurations of the system and",
    "monitor the reaction . in order to locate the gelation transition we analyze the percolation probability @xmath42 , defined as the fraction of configurations leading to a percolating cluster , and we identify the transition with the line @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "in fact , one could expect different regimes depending on the chains concentration .",
    "indeed , if decreasing of the number of active sites will in general correspond to an increase of @xmath96 , the effect of this variation on @xmath91 is likely to strongly depend on chain concentration . at high concentration of chains , if the number of active sites per chain decreases below a certain level , we expect that these will be surrounded by many other sites of the same chain which are not active . as a consequence , due to excluded volume effects",
