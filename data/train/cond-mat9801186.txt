    "when speaking of the isotope effect ( ie ) in superconductors , one generally considers the influence of isotopic substitution on the superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 . in systems",
    "where the pairing mechanism is at least partly mediated by the electron - phonon interaction @xmath2 depends on phonon energies .",
    "thus , replacing one element by its isotope will affect @xmath2 via the change in phonon frequency . in a series of recent papers@xcite",
    "we have shown that besides this most simple case , there are a number of other factors , not related to the pairing mechanism , that can strongly affect the isotope coefficient ( ic ) of @xmath2 .",
    "the influence of the proximity effect , the presence of magnetic impurities and non - adiabaticity were specifically studied .",
    "several experiments were proposed for conventional superconductors and the oxygen ie in high-@xmath2 materials was discussed . in the latter case",
    "it was experimentally shown ( see e.g.  refs .   and references therein ) , that the value of the isotope coefficient of @xmath2 ranges from almost zero to values above @xmath4 , depending on the doping process . the theory developed in ref .   allowed us to present a systematic description of all experimental data collected to this day on the oxygen isotope effect of @xmath2 in yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 related systems .",
    "we stress here the fact , however , that the theory is not restricted to high-@xmath2 materials , but applies to conventional superconductors as well .",
    "the influence on the ie of factors not related to the pairing mechanism@xcite raises the question , whether besides @xmath2 , there are other superconducting properties that also display these new effects . in the present paper we focus on one of the fundamental parameters , the penetration depth , and demonstrate that , indeed , it can display a non - trivial dependence on isotopic substitution .",
    "the treatment is based on our previous analysis in ref .   that focused on the unconventional isotopic dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "after isotope substitution in a superconductor ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the ionic mass ) , the value of the critical temperature is shifted : @xmath10 .",
    "as is known , the isotope coefficient @xmath11 is defined by the relation @xmath12 and is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "suppose now that the superconductor is perturbed by some external factor as e.g.  the presence of magnetic impurities or a normal film ( proximity effect ) .",
    "superconducting properties are affected by these factors .",
    "for example , @xmath14 and , as a consequence , the dependency of the new critical temperature on the ionic mass ( @xmath15 ) will also be changed ( @xmath16 , see refs .  ) .",
    "this not only affects the isotope effect of @xmath2 but also , e.g. , the ie of the penetration depth .    in the following , we are concerned with the isotopic dependence of the penetration depth . by analogy with @xmath2",
    ", we define the new isotope coefficient @xmath17 by the relation @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is determined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the shift of the penetration depth induced by isotopic substitution .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : na ] is concerned with the non - adiabatic ie , whereas secs .",
    "[ sec : mi ] and [ sec : prox ] address the impact of magnetic scattering and the proximity effect on the ic , respectively .",
    "an interesting property of the two latter factors affecting the ie is that the isotope coefficient appears to be _",
    "temperature dependent_. we not only demonstrate here that such effects exist but that they are also sizeable . moreover , we argue that the measure of the ic can be used to probe the presence of non - adiabaticity , magnetic impurities or the proximity effect in superconductors .",
    "the theory leads us to propose several experiments for conventional and high - temperature superconductors .",
    "we also discuss how recent experiments done on high-@xmath2 superconductors@xcite can be described by our theory .",
    "the theory for the non - adiabatic ie of @xmath2 has recently been proposed@xcite and applied to describe the oxygen ic in high - temperature superconductors@xcite as well as properties of manganites@xcite .",
    "we show in this section that other quantities like the penetration depth @xmath0 of a magnetic field can be affected by isotopic substitution through this non - adiabatic channel .",
    "let us describe the main concept of the non - adiabatic ie introduced in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) .",
    "consider a system composed of a conducting system and a charge reservoir ( as for example the cuo@xmath5 plane and the buffer layer of a cuprate high-@xmath2 superconductor ) and assume that there is a charge transfer between these subsystems .",
    "in general , the reservoir  conducting - layer charge - transfer process occurs through a group of atoms located in both subsystems and/or bridging the two .",
    "for example , the charge transfer between the cuo@xmath5 plane and the reservoir ( cuo chain for ybco , bio plane for bi - based oxides , etc ... ) occurs through the apical oxygen .",
    "the electronic degeneracy and the corresponding jahn - teller instability of the group of atoms leads to the crossing of electronic terms . because of the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation for these atoms , the electronic and ionic degrees of freedom can no longer be considered as decoupled .",
    "the potential energy surface considered as a function of the ionic coordinate is composed of two electronic terms with two close minima .",
    "for example , the motion of the apical oxygen which is a lighter ion of the cu - o - cu jahn - teller complex is characterized by two minima ( a more detailed discussion is given in refs .  ; experimental evidence of these minima can be found in refs .  ) .",
    "note that each of these terms can be considered in the harmonic approximation .",
    "the `` double - well '' is thus not related to the anharmonicity of the lattice , but to the non - adiabatic behaviour of the group of ions involved in the charge - transfer process . in a qualitative picture , the charge transfer between the conducting and the reservoir subsystems will involve the tunneling of the ionic complex between the two minima and , as a consequence , the density of charge carriers in the conducting subsystem will depend on the ionic masses .",
    "properties depending on the charge - carrier density @xmath1 will thus be ionic mass dependent ( @xmath21 ) and exhibit an isotope effect .    in order to consider the jahn - teller crossing ( where the adiabatic approximation is not applicable )",
    "it is convenient to use the so - called diabatic representation ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in this representation",
    "one can show@xcite that the energy level splitting has the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 @xmath24 is the electronic part of the hamiltonian and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the electronic wave function ( with electronic coordinates * r * ) depending parametrically on the nuclear coordinates * r * and @xmath28 is the vibrational wave functions . the last equality in eq .  ( [ h12 ] ) was obtained because @xmath29 ( @xmath26 ) is a slow varying function of * r * and can thus be evaluated at @xmath30 , the crossing of electronic terms .",
    "@xmath31 does not depend on the ionic masses .",
    "on the other hand , the important franck - condon factor @xmath32 depends on the lattice wave functions @xmath33 and thus on ionic masses @xmath9",
    ".    the reservoir  conducting - layer charge transfer is accompanied by a change of electronic terms and can be visualized as a multi - step process .",
    "first , the charge carrier can move from the reservoir to the group of ions ( e.g.  from the chains to the apical oxygen in ybco ) . then ,",
    "the complex tunnels to the other electronic term ( @xmath34 ) . as a final step",
    ", the charge carrier can hop to the conducting layer .",
    "we emphasize that this charge transfer is a dynamical process and leads to a stationary state in the sense that the charges oscillate in time between the reservoir and the conducting subsystems , with a frequency given by eq .",
    "( [ h12 ] ) .",
    "since the ionic masses affect @xmath32 , and thus @xmath35 , different isotopic masses imply different values of the characteristic charge - transfer frequency .",
    "this in turn affects the charge - carrier concentration @xmath1 .",
    "the isotope coefficient of @xmath2 can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the usual ( bcs ) phonon contribution ( @xmath38 is a characteristic phonon energy ) and the non - adiabatic contribution is given by : @xmath39 where the parameter @xmath40 has a weak logarithmic dependence on @xmath9 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "( [ tcna ] ) shows that the ic of @xmath2 depends on the doping of the conducting layer and on the relation @xmath41 .",
    "this result was used in ref .   to analyse the ie of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "let us now focus on the non - adiabatic ie of the penetration depth . as shown above",
    "( see also refs .  ) , non - adiabaticity for doped materials such as cuprates , leads to the dependence of the charge - carrier concentration @xmath1 on the ionic mass @xmath9 , that is @xmath42 . in the weak - coupling london limit",
    "the penetration depth is given by the well - known relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the effective mass .",
    "@xmath45 is the superconducting density of charge carriers , related to the normal density @xmath1 through @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath47 is a universal function of @xmath48 .",
    "for example , for conventional superconductors , @xmath49 near @xmath2 , whereas @xmath50 near @xmath51 ( in the absence of magnetic impurities ; their influence is discussed at the end of this and in the following sections ) . note that the relation @xmath52 is also valid in the strong - coupling case ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "we can now determine the isotope coefficient @xmath17 of the penetration depth from the relation ( [ london ] ) : @xmath53 because of the relation @xmath54 , one has to distinguish two contributions to @xmath17 .",
    "there is a usual ( bcs ) contribution , @xmath55 , arising from the fact that @xmath47 depends on ionic mass through the dependency of @xmath2 on the characteristic phonon frequency . indeed",
    ", isotopic substitution leads to a shift in @xmath2 and thus in @xmath0 , which might be noticeable near @xmath2 ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : discna ] ) . in this paper , however , we focus on the non - trivial manifestation of isotopic substitution , arising from the isotope dependence of the charge - carrier concentration @xmath1 .    from eq .",
    "( [ betans ] ) and the relation @xmath54 it follows that @xmath56 where @xmath57 note that @xmath58 is the _ normal_-state charge - carrier concentration .",
    "thus , unlike @xmath55 ( which depends on @xmath59 ) , the non - adiabatic coefficient @xmath60 does _ not _ depend on parameters characterizing the superconducting state .",
    "this effect should be observed near @xmath51k , where @xmath55 is negligibly small .",
    "+ comparing eq .",
    "( [ tcna ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ betana1 ] ) one infers that @xmath61 and thus establish a relation between the non - adiabatic isotope coefficients of @xmath2 and @xmath0 : @xmath62 this result holds for london superconductors .",

    "it is interesting to note that @xmath60 and @xmath63 have opposite signs when @xmath64 ( which corresponds to the underdoped region in high-@xmath2 materials ) .",
    "in later sections we will discuss the influence of magnetic impurities on the isotope effect of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we note here that in the presence of magnetic impurities the relation @xmath54 remains valid , but @xmath65 depends now on the direct scattering amplitude @xmath66 defined in sec .",
    "[ subsec : mit0 ] ( this results , e.g. , in the inequality @xmath67 in the gapless regime ) . as a consequence ,",
    "magnetic impurities affect @xmath55 in eq .",

    "( [ ictcna ] ) unchanged .      the value of the parameter @xmath68 ( see eq .",

    "experiments have been performed on ybco@xcite and la@xmath73sr@xmath74cuo@xmath75@xcite ( lsco ) which indicate that the meissner fraction ( and thus the penetration depth ) indeed displays an isotope shift .",
    "unfortunately , the measurements on ybco have been done near @xmath2 where _ any _ superconductor ( conventional or high-@xmath2 ) displays an isotope shift of @xmath0 through the dependency @xmath76 and corresponds thus to the usual bcs ie ( this is the contribution @xmath55 arising through @xmath65 as discussed in the last section ; see also ref .  ) . the bcs isotope coefficient of @xmath0 ( near @xmath2 )",

    "this statement is valid if one is interested in determining the non - adiabatic contribution to the ic @xmath17 but is not general .",
    "as will be shown below , it is for example possible to extract the influence of magnetic impurities on the ie even near @xmath2 .    the situation with the measurements of ref .",
    "is different .",
    "the experiments@xcite done on lsco were obtained near @xmath51 and reflect the unconventional dependence @xmath81 ( the bcs contribution to the ic of @xmath0 vanishes at these temperatures ) .",
    "the shift has been measured near @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    near the concentration @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath2 experiences a small depression as a function of doping @xmath84.@xcite although several explanations have been proposed ( as , e.g. , the presence of electronic inhomogeneities , a change of the electronic density of states due to lattice distortions , impurity scattering , magnetic ordering , etc ... @xcite ) the presence of the dip is not well understood yet .",
    "the choice of this concentration is thus unfortunate and inappropriate for the study of the ie .",
    "it was argued@xcite that there is no influence of isotopic substitution on the charge carrier concentration @xmath1 near @xmath82 and that @xmath1 can therefore not depend on the ionic mass .",
    "to support this idea the influence of isotopic substitution on the structural ( tetragonal to orthorhombic ) transition temperature @xmath85 was studied@xcite .",
    "the assertion is based on the assumption that @xmath85 depends solely on @xmath1 , that there is a monotonic relation between @xmath85 and @xmath1 with non - zero slope and a one - to - one correspondance between @xmath1 and @xmath84 .",
    "however , the experiments performed on lsco @xcite show that the hole concentration @xmath1 dependency of @xmath2 and @xmath85 as well as the relation @xmath86 are not well established , especially in the region of the dip .",
    "the structural phase transition temperature @xmath85 has also only been measured at three points in the vicinity of the dip@xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 has an unexpected behaviour it would be of interest to study the detailed dependency @xmath87 in this region .",
    "furthermore , as known from other high - temperature superconductors ( as , e.g. , ybco ) it is unlikely that the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath84 is linear .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis of the ic from eqs .",
    "( [ tcna ] ) and ( [ ictcna ] ) does not require any assumption on the relation @xmath86 since we rely solely on the experimental relation as obtained , e.g. , from @xmath88sr experiments ( in this case one has @xmath89 ; see ref .  ) .",
    "in short , since the structural and electronic properties are not well understood in the region around @xmath82 , it does not allow a conclusive statement on the ie of @xmath0 .",
    "the only experimental result@xcite that can be discussed , and that does not contain the bcs contribution is the one done at @xmath83 ( for lsco ) . using eq .",

    "indeed , it is of the same order as @xmath60 for oxygen - depleted ybco .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in both these materials the reservoir - cuo@xmath5-plane charge transfer involves the same group of ions including the apical oxygen .",
    "the larger value for lsco can be traced back to the fact that in ybco one has taken into consideration the presence of magnetic impurities ( which also enhances the ic ) , whereas in lsco there is no indication of the presence of significant quantities of such impurities.@xcite@xmath93    one notes further that the ic of @xmath0 is much larger in ybco and lsco than in yprbco .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy can be twofold . on the one hand , the charge - transfer channel is different in yprbco from the two other materials@xcite ( e.g.  it does not involve the apical oxygen ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentration of magnetic impurities is higher in yprbco than in ybco ( and lsco ) .",
    "this was taken into account in the calculation of @xmath63 and influences the value of @xmath60 in ybco related systems as well",
    ". a larger part of the ic is thus due to the magnetic impurities in yprbco ( see ref .   for a detailed study of the interplay between non - adiabaticity and magnetic impurities ) .",
    "one should add that the experiment determining the ic through magnetic susceptibility measurement@xcite is rather inaccurate .",
    "more reliable data could be obtained by measuring the penetration depth shift using microwave measurements or the josephson effect .",
    "it would be interesting to perform experiments on the systems discussed above that display the non - adiabatic charge - transfer channel .    as stressed earlier and according to the analysis of ref .",
    "one has , however , to include the contribution of magnetic impurities to describe correctly the ie of @xmath2 in some of the high-@xmath2 superconductors .",

    "on the other hand , contrary to the case of magnetic impurities alone ( fig .",
    "2 ) , there is a qualitative difference ( besides the opposite signs ) between the ic of @xmath2 and @xmath0 taken as a function of @xmath2 and in the presence of non - adiabaticity . to understand this , one has to come back to eqs .",
    "( [ icmi])-([r0 ] ) .",

    "it turns out that @xmath150 and @xmath151 are never more than several percents apart from each other for given @xmath141 and @xmath2 .",
    "the shape of @xmath146 in the presence of non - adiabaticity and magnetic impurities is thus mainly determined by the difference @xmath152 [ where @xmath153 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ictcmi ] ) and @xmath154 by eq .",
    "( [ tcna ] ) ] . using a polynomial expansion of @xmath41 ( as done in ref .  )",
    "one can show that @xmath11 saturates with decreasing @xmath2 [ @xmath155 , with @xmath68 defined in eq .",
    "( [ tcna ] ) ] , whereas @xmath153 increases as @xmath156 in the same limit ( see ref .  ) . thus , at high impurity doping , the behaviour of @xmath146 is dominated by the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ ictcmi ] ) , that is by the magnetic impurities . in the opposite low doping regime",
    ", @xmath146 is dominated by the non - adiabatic part in @xmath153 and @xmath11 . accordingly",
    ", @xmath146 behaves similarly near optimal @xmath2 and near the 60k plateau ( in ybco ) , where @xmath157 is small .",
    "thus , as can be seen on fig .",
    "3b , @xmath146 behaves approximately as @xmath158 in these regions but is smaller by an amount approximately equivalent to @xmath11 .",
    "as one gets away from the plateaus , the magnetic impurity part of @xmath159 becomes dominant , leading to a departure from the behaviour of @xmath63 .",
    "the fact that @xmath146 is mainly determined by @xmath160 ( instead of @xmath161 for the ic of @xmath2 ) explains why the change of curvature of @xmath146 ( see fig .",
    "3b ) takes place at higher @xmath2 s ( lower magnetic impurity concentrations ) than the ic of @xmath2 , @xmath153 ( see also fig .  2a of ref .  ) .",
    "the change of curvature should be measurable since the precision of measurements increases with decreasing doping@xcite .",
    "accordingly , the effect should also be observable for oxygen - depleted ybco for @xmath2 near its optimal value and below but near the 60k plateau .",
    "we have not calculated the penetration depth ic for oxygen - depleted ybco near @xmath2 because the dependencies @xmath162 ( the spin - flip scattering amplitude as a function of oxygen doping ) and @xmath86 are not well known for this material .",
    "this was not a major problem for the calculation of the ic @xmath153 of @xmath2 , because @xmath153 is mainly determined by the non - adiabatic channel in the regime where the experiments were performed and is affected by magnetic impurities in the higher doping ( i.e.  lower @xmath2 , away from the plateaus ) regime ( see eq .",
    "( [ ictcmi ] ) and ref .  ) . however , it might be of importance for the calculation of the ic of @xmath0 because of the more complicated structure of the relation @xmath163 .",
    "this case is discussed in more detail in ref .  .",
    "finally , one should note that there is no apparent reason for the ic of @xmath0 to be restricted to values below @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the calculations show that at high enough dopant concentration , the effect should be very large ( this is also true at @xmath51 as shown in the next section ) .      since we want to determine solely the contribution of non - adiabaticity and magnetic impurities to the ic , one is interested in eliminating the presence of the bcs contribution caused by the factor @xmath47 and the usual isotopic dependence of @xmath2 .",

    "one possibility is to use different films , another is to modify the quality of the @xmath204 interface .",
