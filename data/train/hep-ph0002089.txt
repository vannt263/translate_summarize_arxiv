    "within the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath4 violation is caused by a non - zero complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "while the experimentally observed indirect @xmath4 violation in the neutral kaon system , @xmath18 , can be accommodated in the sm , it is still an open question whether the sm description of @xmath4 violation is consistent with the new experimental result on direct @xmath4 violation , @xmath19 , since the theoretical prediction of its precise value suffers from large hadronic uncertainties @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the baryon asymmetry of the universe has been generated via baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition , the ckm mechanism of @xmath4 violation can not account for the observed amount of baryon asymmetry .",
    "this feature could be a hint of the existence of @xmath4-violating sources outside the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "important tests of the sm are provided by flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) reactions involving @xmath0 decays @xcite , thus offering an opportunity to search for supersymmetric extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "there are at present only a few fcnc processes which have been observed experimentally , but the situation will change considerably after the completion of @xmath0 factories in the near future .    in this work ,",
    "we analyse the exclusive decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the context of supersymmetry ( susy ) with minimal particle content and r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the inclusive reaction @xmath22 within supersymmetric models has been extensively studied in and , more recently , in .",
    "new physics effects in the exclusive channels have been investigated in .",
    "we place particular emphasis on @xmath4-violating effects associated with the partial rate asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath5 decays as well as the forward - backward asymmetry of the @xmath23 . within the sm these effects turn out to be unobservably small ( @xmath24 ) in the decays @xmath6 @xcite , and amount to only a few per cent in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , in models with new @xmath4-violating phases in addition to the single phase of the ckm matrix , larger effects may occur due to the interference of amplitudes with different phases .",
    "the purpose of the present analysis is to explore @xmath4-violating observables in the aforementioned fcnc reactions that could provide evidence of a non - standard source of @xmath4 violation , and hence may be useful in analysing supersymmetry in future collider experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we exhibit the various mixing matrices of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the presence of additional @xmath4-violating phases .",
    "within such a framework we discuss different scenarios for the susy parameters . in ,",
    "we are primarily concerned with the short - distance matrix element and wilson coefficients governing @xmath1 in the mssm .",
    "we also briefly describe an approximate procedure to incorporate quark antiquark resonant intermediate states ",
    "namely @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 family  which enter through the decay chain @xmath27 . section [ decays : exc ] is devoted to the exclusive decay modes @xmath20 and @xmath28 , where formulae are given to calculate @xmath4 asymmetries which can be determined experimentally by measuring the difference of @xmath0 and @xmath5 events . in , we present our numerical results for @xmath4-violating observables in the non - resonant domain @xmath8 , taking into account experimental bounds on rare @xmath0 decays such as @xmath14 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in .",
    "the analytic formulae describing the short - distance effects in the presence of susy as well as the explicit expressions for the form factors are relegated to the appendices .",
    "in the mssm , there are new sources of @xmath4 violation . in general , a large number of @xmath4-violating phases appear in the mass matrices as well as the couplings . after an appropriate redefinition of fields",
    "one ends up with at least two new @xmath4-violating phases , besides the phase of the ckm matrix and the qcd vacuum angle , which can not be rotated away .",
    "for instance , in the mssm with universal boundary conditions at some high scale only two new physical phases arise ; namely @xmath29 associated with the higgsino mass parameter @xmath3 in the superpotential and @xmath30 connected with the soft susy - breaking trilinear mass terms .    in order to fulfil the severe constraints on the electric dipole moments ( edm s ) of electron and neutron ,",
    "one generally assumes that the new phases are less than @xmath31 .",
    "since there is no underlying symmetry which would force the phases to be small , this requires fine - tuning .",
    "of course , one can relax the tight constraint on these phases by having masses of the superpartners in the @xmath32 region ; this heavy susy spectrum may , however , lead to an unacceptably large contribution to the cosmological relic density .",
    "it has recently been pointed out by several authors that it is possible to evade the edm constraints so that phases of @xmath13 still remain consistent with the current experimental upper limits .",
    "methods that have been advocated to suppress the edm s include cancellations among different susy contributions @xcite , and nearly degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations while being consistent with naturalness bounds .",
    "the latter can be realized within the context of so - called ` effective susy ' models @xcite , thereby solving the susy fcnc and @xmath4 problems .",
    "to get an idea how supersymmetry affects @xmath4 observables in rare @xmath0 decays , we will consider as illustrative examples the following types of susy models :    mssm coupled to @xmath33 supergravity with a universal susy - breaking sector at the grand unification scale .",
    "effective susy with near degeneracy of the heavy first and second generation sfermions . in the present analysis , we restrict ourselves to the discussion of flavour - diagonal sfermion mass matrices  that is",

    "in we have adjusted the phase of the @xmath3 parameter in such a way that @xmath39 is real at tree level , thereby ensuring that the vev s of the two higgs fields are real . consequently , the mass matrix becomes real and can be reduced to a diagonal form through a biorthogonal transformation @xmath40 . at the tree level , i.e.  @xmath41 in ,",

    "this leads to the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) inspired model , commonly referred to as the constrained mssm @xcite . in this model",
    "one assumes universality of the soft terms at some high scale , which we take to be the scale of gauge coupling unification , @xmath79 , implying that ( i ) all gaugino mass parameters are equal to a common mass @xmath80 ; ( ii ) all the scalar mass parameters share a common value @xmath81 ; and ( iii ) all the soft trilinear couplings are equal to @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "the msugra model has only two new independent phases which are associated with the @xmath83 and @xmath82 parameters .",

    "the parameters at the electroweak scale are then obtained by solving the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) .",
    "a few remarks are in order here .",
    "first , the phases of the gaugino mass terms @xmath69 are not affected by the renormalization group evolution , and therefore the low energy gaugino mass parameters are real .",
    "second , the phase that appears together with the @xmath3 parameter does not run at one - loop level so that @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , to satisfy the constraints on the edm s of electron and neutron , @xmath85 has to be of @xmath31 unless strong cancellations between different contributions occur .",
    "third , solving the rge s for the evolution of the @xmath4-violating phase of the @xmath86-term yields a small value for @xmath87 , and thus is not constrained by the edm s @xcite .",
    "lastly , off - diagonal entries occur in the squark mass matrices due to renormalization group evolution of the parameters even in the absence of flavour mixing at the gut scale .",
    "however , these effects are found to be small and therefore the squark mass matrix is essentially flavour diagonal at the electroweak scale ( see also ) .      as an example of susy models with large cp phases , we consider the effective supersymmetry picture @xcite without assuming universality of sfermion masses at a high scale . within such a framework ,",
    "the first and second generation sfermions are almost degenerate and have masses above the @xmath88 scale , while third generation sfermions can be light enough to be accessible at future hadron colliders .",
    "consequently , fcnc reactions as well as one - loop contributions to the edm s of electron and neutron are well below the current experimental bounds .",
    "however , it should be noted that the edm s also receive contributions at two - loop level involving scalar bottom and top quarks that may become important for phases of order unity in the large @xmath89 regime @xcite . in our numerical work , @xmath90 is assumed to be in the interval @xmath91 .",
    "let us start with the qcd - corrected matrix element describing the short - distance interactions in @xmath92 within the sm .",
    "it is given by [ mael : short ] + & & - ] |l^ p_l l + ( c_10-c_10 ) |l^ p_r l } , where @xmath93 is the four - momentum of the lepton pair , and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) in the case of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) . in the sm , the wilson coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 are real with values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , and the leading term in @xmath102 has the form @xcite [ wilson : c9app ] = c_9 + ( 3 c_1 + c _ 2)\\{g(m_c , q^2 ) + _u}+ , where @xmath103 .",

    ", we will assume @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .",

    ", we will assume that in the presence of new physics there are no new operators beyond those that correspond to the wilson coefficients appearing in .",
    "( for a discussion of the implications of new operators for rare @xmath0 decays , see , e.g. , . ) thus , the effect of new physics is simply to modify the matching conditions of the wilson coefficients , i.e.  their absolute values and phases at the electroweak scale .    as a result ,",
    "we are left with additional susy contributions at one - loop level to the wilson coefficients @xmath98 , @xmath102 , and @xmath99 in .",
    "in fact , they arise from penguin and box diagrams with ( i ) charged higgs boson up - type quark loops ; ( ii ) chargino up - type squark loops ; ( iii ) neutralino down - type squark loops ; and ( iv ) gluino down - type squark loops .",
    "thus , the short - distance coefficients can be conveniently written as [ wilson : komplett ] c_i(m_w ) = c_i^(m_w ) + c_i^(m_w ) + c_i^(m_w ) + c_i^(m_w)+ c_i^(m_w ) ( i=7 ,  , 10 ) .",
    "the explicit expressions for the various wilson coefficients are given in appendix [ app : wilson ] .",
    "since we limit our attention to flavour - conserving effects in the squark sector , the neutralino and gluino exchange contributions in will be omitted in our numerical calculations .    for future reference , we parametrize the new physics contributions as follows : [ ratio : np - sm ] r_i = |r_i| e^i _ i , = , where @xmath114 is real to a good approximation within the models under study .      we have considered so far only the short - distance interactions . a more complete analysis , however , has also to take into account resonance contributions due to @xmath113 , @xmath115 , and @xmath112 intermediate states , i.e.  @xmath116 , and so forth .",
    "a detailed discussion of the various theoretical suggestions of how to describe these effects is given in .",
    "we employ here the approach proposed in which makes use of the renormalized photon vacuum polarization , @xmath117 , related to cross - section data ( s ) , with @xmath118 .",

    "4m_^2^d s , with @xmath119 denoting the principal value .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath26 family ( i.e.  @xmath120 ) the imaginary part of the one - loop function @xmath121 , , can be expressed as [ im : gmc ] g(m_c , s)=^j/(s ) , ^j/(s)(s)+ ( s ) , where the subscripts ` cont ' and ` res ' stand for continuum and resonance contributions respectively , while the real part is given by [ re : gmc ] g(m_c , s)= -(m_c / m_b)-+ p _",
