    "the general relativistic problem of motion , i.e. the problem of describing the dynamics of @xmath0 gravitationally interacting extended bodies , is one of the cardinal problems of einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "this problem has been investigated from the early days of development of general relativity , notably through the pioneering works of einstein , droste and de  sitter .",
    "these authors introduced the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation method , which combines three different expansions : ( i ) a weak - field expansion @xmath1 ; ( ii ) a slow - motion expansion @xmath2 ; and a near - zone expansion @xmath3 .",
    "pn theory could be easily worked out to derive the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximation , i.e. the leading - order general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity ( involving one power of @xmath4 ) . however , the use of the pn approximation for describing the dynamics of @xmath0 extended bodies turned out to be fraught with difficulties .",
    "most of the early derivations of the 1pn - accurate equations of motion of @xmath0 bodies turned out to involve errors : this is , in particular , the case of the investigations of droste  @xcite , de  sitter  @xcite , chazy  @xcite and levi - civita  @xcite .",
    "these errors were linked to incorrect treatments of the internal structures of the bodies .",
    "apart from the remarkable 1917 work of lorentz and droste  @xcite ( which seems to have remained unnoticed during many years ) , the first correct derivations of the 1pn - accurate equations of motion date from 1938 , and were obtained by einstein , infeld and hoffmann  @xcite , and eddington and clark  @xcite . after these pioneering works ( and the investigations they triggered , notably in russia  @xcite and poland ) , the general relativistic @xmath0-body problem reached a first stage of maturity and became codified in various books , notably in the books of fock  @xcite , infeld and plebanski  @xcite , and in the second volume of the treatise of landau and lifshitz ( starting , at least , with the 1962 second english edition ) .",
    "we have started by recalling the early history of the general relativistic problem of motion both because victor brumberg has always shown a deep knowledge of this history , and because , as we shall discuss below , some of his research work has contributed to clarifying several of the weak points of the early pn investigations ( notably those linked to the treatment of the internal structures of the @xmath0 bodies ) .    for many years , the 1pn approximation turned out to be accurate enough for applying einstein s theory to known @xmath0-body systems , such as the solar system , and various binary stars .",
    "it is still true today that the 1pn approximation ( especially when used in its multi - chart version , see below ) is adequate for describing general relativistic effects in the solar system .",
    "however , the discovery in the 1970 s of binary systems comprising strongly self - gravitating bodies ( black holes or neutron stars ) has obliged theorists to develop improved approaches to the @xmath0-body problem .",
    "these improved approaches are not limited ( as the traditional pn method ) to the case of weakly self - gravitating bodies and can be viewed as modern versions of the einstein - infeld - hoffmann classic work  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the need of considering strongly self - gravitating bodies , the discovery of binary pulsars in the mid 1970 s ( starting with the hulse - taylor pulsar psr  @xmath5 ) obliged theorists to go beyond the 1pn @xmath6 relativistic effects in the equations of motion .",
    "more precisely , it was necessary to go to the 2.5pn approximation level , i.e. to include terms @xmath7 beyond newton in the equations of motion .",
    "this was achieved in the 1980 s by several groups  @xcite .",
    "[ let us note that important progress in obtaining the @xmath0-body metric and equations of motion at the 2pn level was achieved by the japanese school in the 1970 s  @xcite . ]",
    "motivation for pushing the accuracy of the equations of motion beyond the 2.5pn level came from the prospect of detecting the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing binary systems , notably binary neutron star ( bns ) and binary black hole ( bbh ) systems .",
    "the 3pn - level equations of motion ( including terms @xmath8 beyond newton ) were derived in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s @xcite ( they have been recently rederived in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the 4pn - level dynamics has been tackled in  @xcite .    separately from these purely analytical approaches to the motion and radiation of binary systems , which have been developed since the early days of einstein s theory , numerical relativity ( nr ) simulations of einstein s equations have relatively recently ( 2005 ) succeeded ( after more than thirty years of developmental progress ) to stably evolve binary systems made of comparable mass black holes @xcite . this has led to an explosion of works exploring many different aspects of strong - field dynamics in general relativity , such as spin effects , recoil , relaxation of the deformed horizon formed during the coalescence of two black holes to a stationary kerr black hole , high - velocity encounters , etc . ;",
    "see @xcite for a review and @xcite for an impressive example of the present capability of nr codes .",
    "in addition , recently developed codes now allow one to accurately study the orbital dynamics , and the coalescence of binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "much physics remains to be explored in these systems , especially during and after the merger of the neutron stars ( which involves a much more complex physics than the pure - gravity merger of two black holes ) .",
    "recently , a new source of information on the general relativistic two - body problem has opened : gravitational self - force ( gsf ) theory .",
    "this approach goes one step beyond the test - particle approximation ( already used by einstein in 1915 ) by taking into account self - field effects that modify the leading - order geodetic motion of a small mass @xmath9 moving in the background geometry generated by a large mass @xmath10 . after some ground work",
    "( notably by dewitt and brehme ) in the 1960 s , gsf theory has recently undergone rapid developments ( mixing theoretical and numerical methods ) and can now yield numerical results that yield access to new information on strong - field dynamics in the extreme mass - ratio limit @xmath11 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "each of the approaches to the two - body problem mentioned so far , pn theory , nr simulations and gsf theory , have their advantages and their drawbacks .",
    "it has become recently clear that the best way to meet the challenge of accurately computing the gravitational waveforms ( depending on several continuous parameters ) that are needed for a successful detection and data analysis of gw signals in the upcoming ligo / virgo / geo/@xmath12 network of gw detectors is to combine knowledge from all the available approximation methods : pn , nr and gsf .",
    "several ways of doing so are a priori possible .",
    "for instance , one could try to directly combine pn - computed waveforms ( approximately valid for large enough separations , say @xmath13 ) with nr waveforms ( computed with initial separations @xmath14 and evolved up to merger and ringdown ) .",
    "however , this method still requires too much computational time , and is likely to lead to waveforms of rather poor accuracy , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .    on the other hand , five years before nr succeeded in simulating the late inspiral and the coalescence of binary black holes , a new approach to the two - body problem",
    "was proposed : the effective one body ( eob ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the basic aim of the eob formalism is to provide an analytical description of both the motion and the radiation of coalescing binary systems over the entire merger process , from the early inspiral , right through the plunge , merger and final ringdown .",
    "as early as 2000  @xcite this method made several quantitative and qualitative predictions concerning the dynamics of the coalescence , and the corresponding gw radiation , notably : ( i ) a blurred transition from inspiral to a ` plunge ' that is just a smooth continuation of the inspiral , ( ii ) a sharp transition , around the merger of the black holes , between a continued inspiral and a ring - down signal , and ( iii ) estimates of the radiated energy and of the spin of the final black hole .",
    "in addition , the effects of the individual spins of the black holes were investigated within the eob  @xcite and were shown to lead to a larger energy release for spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum , and to a dimensionless rotation parameter @xmath15 always smaller than unity at the end of the inspiral ( so that a kerr black hole can form right after the inspiral phase ) .",
    "all those predictions have been broadly confirmed by the results of the recent numerical simulations performed by several independent groups ( for a review of numerical relativity results and references see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that , in spite of the high computer power used in nr simulations , the calculation , checking and processing of one sufficiently long waveform ( corresponding to specific values of the many continuous parameters describing the two arbitrary masses , the initial spin vectors , and other initial data ) takes on the order of one month .",
    "this is a very strong argument for developing analytical models of waveforms .",
    "for a recent comprehensive comparison between analytical models and numerical waveforms see  @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we shall briefly review only a few facets of the general relativistic two body problem .",
    "[ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews dealing with other facets of , or approaches to , the general relativistic two - body problem . ]",
    "first , we shall recall the essential ideas of the multi - chart approach to the problem of motion , having especially in mind its application to the motion of compact binaries , such as bns or bbh systems .",
    "then we shall focus on the effective one body ( eob ) approach to the motion and radiation of binary systems , from its conceptual framework to its comparison to nr simulations .",
    "the traditional ( text book ) approach to the problem of motion of @xmath0 separate bodies in gr consists of solving , by successive approximations , einstein s field equations ( we use the signature @xmath16 ) @xmath17 together with their consequence @xmath18 to do so , one assumes some specific matter model , say a perfect fluid , @xmath19 one expands ( say in powers of newton s constant ) the metric , @xmath20 and use the simplifications brought by the ` post - newtonian ' approximation ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "then one integrates the local material equation of motion ( [ eq2.2 ] ) over the volume of each separate body , labelled say by @xmath24 . in so doing",
    ", one must define some ` center of mass ' @xmath25 of body @xmath26 , as well as some ( approximately conserved ) ` mass ' @xmath27 of body @xmath26 , together with some corresponding ` spin vector ' @xmath28 and , possibly , higher multipole moments .",
    "an important feature of this traditional method is to use a _ unique coordinate chart _ @xmath29 to describe the full @xmath0-body system .",
    "for instance , the center of mass , shape and spin of each body @xmath26 are all described within this common coordinate system @xmath29 .",
    "this use of a single chart has several inconvenient aspects , even in the case of weakly self - gravitating bodies ( as in the solar system case ) .",
    "indeed , it means for instance that a body which is , say , spherically symmetric in its own ` rest frame ' @xmath30 will appear as deformed into some kind of ellipsoid in the common coordinate chart @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , it is not clear how to construct ` good definitions ' of the center of mass , spin vector , and higher multipole moments of body @xmath26 , when described in the common coordinate chart @xmath29 . in addition , as we are possibly interested in the motion of strongly self - gravitating bodies , it is not a priori justified to use a simple expansion of the type ( [ eq2.4 ] ) because @xmath31 will not be uniformly small in the common coordinate system @xmath29 .",
    "it will be small if one stays far away from each object @xmath26 , but , it will become of order unity on the surface of a compact body .",
    "these two shortcomings of the traditional ` one - chart ' approach to the relativistic problem of motion can be cured by using a  _ multi - chart approach_.the multi - chart approach describes the motion of @xmath0 ( possibly , but not necessarily , compact ) bodies by using @xmath32 separate coordinate systems : ( i ) one _ global _ coordinate chart @xmath29 ( @xmath33 ) used to describe the spacetime outside @xmath0 ` tubes ' , each containing one body , and ( ii ) @xmath0 _ local _ coordinate charts @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ) used to describe the spacetime in and around each body @xmath26 .",
    "the multi - chart approach was first used to discuss the motion of black holes and other compact objects @xcite .",
    "then it was also found to be very convenient for describing , with the high - accuracy required for dealing with modern technologies such as vlbi , systems of @xmath0 weakly self - gravitating bodies , such as the solar system @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of the multi - chart approach is to combine the information contained in _",
    "several expansions_. one uses both a global expansion of the type ( [ eq2.4 ] ) and several local expansions of the type @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the ( possibly strong - field ) metric generated by an isolated body of mass @xmath27 ( possibly with the additional effect of spin ) .    the separate expansions ( [ eq2.4 ] ) and ( [ eq2.5 ] ) are then ` matched ' in some overlapping domain of common validity of the type @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) , where one can relate the different coordinate systems by expansions of the form @xmath41    the multi - chart approach becomes simplified if one considers _ compact _ bodies ( of radius @xmath42 comparable to @xmath43 ) .",
    "in this case , it was shown @xcite , by considering how the ` internal expansion ' ( [ eq2.5 ] ) propagates into the ` external ' one ( [ eq2.4 ] ) via the matching ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , that , _ in general relativity _",
    ", the internal structure of each compact body was _ effaced _ to a very high degree , when seen in the external expansion ( [ eq2.4 ] ) . for instance , for non spinning bodies , the internal structure of each body ( notably the way it responds to an external tidal excitation ) shows up in the external problem of motion only at the _ fifth post - newtonian _ ( 5pn ) approximation ,",
    "i.e. in terms of order @xmath44 in the equations of motion",
    ".    this _ `",
    "effacement of internal structure ' _ indicates that it should be possible to simplify the rigorous multi - chart approach by skeletonizing each compact body by means of some delta - function source .",
    "mathematically , the use of distributional sources is delicate in a nonlinear theory such as gr .",
    "however , it was found that one can reproduce the results of the more rigorous matched - multi - chart approach by treating the divergent integrals generated by the use of delta - function sources by means of ( complex ) analytic continuation @xcite . in particular ,",
    "analytic continuation in the dimension of space @xmath45 @xcite is very efficient ( especially at high pn orders ) .    finally , the most efficient way to derive the general relativistic equations of motion of @xmath0 compact bodies consists of solving the equations derived from the action ( where @xmath46 ) @xmath47 formally using the standard weak - field expansion ( [ eq2.4 ] ) , but considering the space dimension @xmath45 as an arbitrary complex number which is sent to its physical value @xmath48 only at the end of the calculation .",
    "this ` skeletonized ' effective action approach to the motion of compact bodies has been extended to other theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "finite - size corrections can be taken into account by adding nonminimal worldline couplings to the effective action ( [ eq2.7 ] ) @xcite .    as we shall further discuss below ,",
    "in the case of coalescing bns systems , finite - size corrections ( linked to tidal interactions ) become relevant during late inspiral and must be included to accurately describe the dynamics of coalescing neutron stars .    here , we shall not try to describe the results of the application of the multi - chart method to @xmath0-body ( or @xmath49-body ) systems . for applications to the solar system see the book  @xcite of v. brumberg ; see also several articles ( notably by m.  soffel ) in  @xcite . for applications of this method to binary pulsar systems",
    "( and to their use as tests of gravity theories ) see the articles by t.  damour and m.  kramer in  @xcite .",
    "before reviewing some of the technical aspects of the eob method , let us indicate the historical roots of this method .",
    "first , we note that the eob approach comprises three , rather separate , ingredients :    1 .    a description of the conservative ( hamiltonian ) part of the dynamics of two bodies ; 2 .",
    "an expression for the radiation - reaction part of the dynamics ; 3 .    a description of the gw waveform emitted by a coalescing binary system .",
    "for each one of these ingredients , the essential inputs that are used in eob works are high - order post - newtonian ( pn ) expanded results which have been obtained by many years of work , by many researchers ( see the review @xcite ) . however , one of the key ideas in the eob philosophy is to avoid using pn results in their original `` taylor - expanded '' form ( _ i.e. _ @xmath50 , but to use them instead in some _ resummed _ form ( _ i.e. _ some non - polynomial function of @xmath51 , defined so as to incorporate some of the expected non - perturbative features of the exact result ) .",
    "the basic ideas and techniques for resumming each ingredient of the eob are different and have different historical roots .    concerning the first ingredient , _",
    "i.e. _ the eob hamiltonian , it was inspired by an approach to electromagnetically interacting quantum two - body systems introduced by brzin , itzykson and zinn - justin  @xcite .",
    "the resummation of the second ingredient , _",
    "i.e. _ the eob radiation - reaction force @xmath52 , was initially inspired by the pad resummation of the flux function introduced by damour , iyer and sathyaprakash  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new and more sophisticated resummation technique for the ( waveform and the ) radiation reaction force @xmath52 has been introduced by damour , iyer and nagar  @xcite .",
    "it will be discussed in detail below .    as for the third ingredient , _",
    "i.e. _ the eob description of the waveform emitted by a coalescing black hole binary , it was mainly inspired by the work of davis , ruffini and tiomno  @xcite which discovered the transition between the plunge signal and a ringing tail when a particle falls into a black hole .",
    "additional motivation for the eob treatment of the transition from plunge to ring - down came from work on the , so - called , `` close limit approximation ''  @xcite .    within the usual pn formalism ,",
    "the conservative dynamics of a two - body system is currently fully known up to the @xmath53pn level @xcite ( see below for the partial knowledge beyond the @xmath53pn level )",

    "we mentioned in the introduction that gsf theory has recently opened a new source of information on the general relativistic two - body problem .",

    "the meaning for eob theory of this singular behavior of @xmath450 at the light - ring is discussed in detail in ref .",

    "@xcite so as to obtain the complete analytical expression of the 4pn - level contribution to the @xmath188 potential . specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the coefficient @xmath464 of @xmath465 in the pn expansion , of @xmath452 , @xmath466 was equal to @xmath467 with @xmath468 note that @xmath351 is _ no more than quadratic _ in @xmath79 , i.e. _ without _ contributions of degree @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",
    "[ contributions of degree @xmath469 and @xmath470 would a priori be expected in a 4pn level quantity ; see , e.g. , @xmath471 below .",

    "the fact that similar remarkable cancellations still hold , at the 4pn level , is a clear indication that the eob packaging of information of the dynamics in the @xmath452 potential is quite compact .",
    "by contrast , the pn expansions of other dynamical functions do not exhibit such cancellations .",
    "for instance , the coefficients entering the pn expansion of the ( gauge - invariant ) function @xmath474 relating the total energy to the frequency parameter @xmath475 , namely @xmath476 contain all the a priori possible powers of @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , at the 4pn level @xmath471 is a polynomial of fourth degree in @xmath79 .",
    "though the present work did not attempt to expound the many different approaches to the general relativistic two - body problem but focussed only on a few approaches , we hope to have made it clear that there is a _",
    "complementarity _ between the various current ways of tackling this problem : post - newtonian , effective one body , gravitational self - force , and numerical relativity simulations . among these approaches ,",
    "the effective one body formalism plays a special role in that it allows one to combine , in a synergetic manner , information coming from the other approaches .",
    "as we are approaching the 100@xmath477 anniversary of the discovery of general relativity , it is striking to see how this theory has not only passed with flying colors many stringent tests , but has established itself as an essential tool for describing many aspects of the universe from , say , the big bang to an accurate description of planets and satellites .",
    "though the two - body ( and , more generally , the @xmath0-body ) problem is one of the oldest problems in general relativity , it is more lively than ever . indeed",
    ", several domains of ( astro-)physics and astronomy are providing new incentives for improving the various ways of describing general relativistic @xmath0-body systems : the developement of ( ground - based and space - based ) detectors of gravitational waves , the development of improved techniques for observing binary pulsars , the prospect of observing soon ( with gaia ) a billion stars with @xmath478 arcsec accuracy , @xmath12 together with our esteemed friend and colleague victor brumberg , who pioneered important developments in relativistic celestial mechanics , we are all looking forward to witnessing new applications of einstein s vision of gravity to the description and understanding of physical reality .",

    "<S> the two - body problem in general relativity has been the subject of many analytical investigations . after reviewing some of the methods used to tackle this problem ( and , more generally , the @xmath0-body problem ) , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a new , recently introduced approach to the motion and radiation of ( comparable mass ) binary systems : the effective one body ( eob ) formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we review the basic elements of this formalism , and discuss some of its recent developments . </S>",
    "<S> several recent comparisons between eob predictions and numerical relativity ( nr ) simulations have shown the aptitude of the eob formalism to provide accurate descriptions of the dynamics and radiation of various binary systems ( comprising black holes or neutron stars ) in regimes that are inaccessible to other analytical approaches ( such as the last orbits and the merger of comparable mass black holes ) . in synergy with nr simulations , post - newtonian ( pn ) theory and gravitational self - force ( gsf ) computations , </S>",
    "<S> the eob formalism is likely to provide an efficient way of computing the very many accurate template waveforms that are needed for gravitational wave ( gw ) data analysis purposes . </S>"
