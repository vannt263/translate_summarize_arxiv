    "dislocation dynamics is a complex intermittent phenomenon involving the collective motion of many dislocations interacting between each other as well with obstacles eventually present in the material , like solute atoms or quenched dislocations from other glide planes @xcite .",
    "the long range stress produced by dislocations may lead to jamming and avalanche - like phenomena even in the absence of obstacles @xcite .",
    "the presence of obstacles changes the local properties of the host material , resulting in a pinning force on nearby dislocations @xcite .",
    "usually , this source of disorder for dislocations is taken to be quenched , so that its properties do not change within the relevant timescales of the system @xcite . however",
    ", under specific conditions , the mobility of solute atoms in metallic alloys @xcite , or oxygen vacancies in superconductors @xcite , plays an important role in the dynamics of these systems .",
    "here we are interested in studying the dynamics of interacting dislocations mediated by mobile impurities .",
    "the interplay between dislocations mutual interactions and pinning by mobile impurities is believed to be at the origin of plastic instabilities observed in metallic alloys under suitable loading conditions and temperature .",
    "one of the best studied forms of instability propagation is the portevin - le chatelier ( plc ) effect @xcite .",
    "when a specimen of a dilute alloy ( such as al or cu alloy , or mild steel ) is strained in uniaxial loading , the mechanical response is often discontinuous . in constant applied strain rate tests ,",
    "the stress versus strain ( or time , which is proportional to strain ) curves exhibit a succession of stress drops and reloading sequences ( serration ) .    from a dynamical point of view",
    ", the jerky or stick - slip behavior of stress is related to the discontinuous motion of dislocations , namely , the pinning ( stick ) and unpinning ( slip ) of dislocations . the classical explanation of the plc effect is via the dynamic strain aging ( dsa ) concept @xcite .",
    "it is based on the interplay between the diffusivity of solute atoms and dislocations that can be arrested temporarily at obstacles during their waiting time .",
    "thus , the longer the dislocations are arrested , the larger will be the stress required to unpin them . as a result ,",
    "when the contribution from aging is large enough , the critical stress to move a dislocation increases with increasing waiting time or decreasing imposed strain rate . when these dislocations are unpinned , they move at large speed until they are arrested again . at high strain rates ( or low temperatures ) , the time available for solute atoms to diffuse towards the dislocations in order to age them decreases and hence the stress required to unpin them decreases .",
    "thus , in a range of strain rates and temperatures where these two time scales are of the same order of magnitude , the plc instability manifests .",
    "the competition between the slow rate of aging and sudden unpinning of the dislocations , translates at the macroscopic level , into a negative strain rate sensitivity ( srs ) of the flow stress as a function of strain rate .",
    "this basic instability mechanism , used in most phenomenological models for the plc effect @xcite , is based on the behavior of individual dislocation and thus does not explain how dislocation motion can synchronize to yield macroscopic strain bursts .",
    "current theoretical approaches to models the plc effect are based on a mesoscopic descriptive level ( where coarse grained dislocation density is considered ) in which phenomenological parameters are needed to construct the relative dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "modeling plastic deformation phenomena taking into account inhomogeneity at the dislocation level offers fundamental advantages compared to continuum mechanics approaches .",
    "the discrete dislocation dynamical ( ddd ) approaches allow , for example , to account for the intrinsic length scales , such as the grain size , the mesh length of a dislocation network or the cross - slip height , which is necessary to understand the formation of spatial dislocation structures , as persistent slip bands @xcite , and plastic instabilities , as lders band and the plc effect @xcite .",
    "the problem of spatial and temporal coupling in heterogeneously deforming materials , and the associated length and time scales to be included in constitutive laws , is a central issue in current attempts to bridge a gap between dislocation based constitutive models and continuum mechanics .",
    "the general three - dimensional dynamical problem of dislocation lines interacting among each other is a complex problem due to the necessity to consider flexible lines conserving their connectivity and line length and take care of line interactions @xcite . in several instances , however , dislocations are arranged into regular structures that are amenable to analytical treatment and more efficient simulation approach .",
    "here we analyze the dynamics of the effective one - dimensional dislocation array called pileup interacting with mobile impurities .",
    "a slip band can be envisaged as a queue of dislocations , a pileup , pushed through a series of obstacles ( solute atoms or immobile dislocations from other glide planes ) . in our case",
    "the obstacles perform a diffusive motion due to thermal effects , and interact with dislocations .",
    "this system can be viewed as a coupled one - dimensional channels of particles @xcite , in which particles in one channel ( dislocations ) are driven by an external force and experience a drag from the undriven particles ( impurities ) in the other channel . in",
    "the following we discuss before the single dislocation in a cloud of mobile impurities problem , analyzed in ref.@xcite , and then we propose a generalization of the equations in the case of many interacting dislocations in a landscape of mobile impurities .",

[ fig2 ] ) , we argued that at low temperatures ( in fig.[fig2](c),(e),(f ) ) dislocations are completely pinned , and verified that by means of the formula @xmath92 $ ] previously obtained from the equations of motion imposing the condition of complete pinning . integrating the distributions of pinning centers , @xmath138 , for low temperatures , we can obtain the average number of pinning centers around dislocations that is @xmath145 which confirms directly that in these cases all pinning centers are pinning dislocations .",
    "computing the standard deviation of the average distribution in fig.[fig4 ] , confirms that when serration emerges , for @xmath88 , dislocations depin in a choerent way .",
    "indeed , in this case the standard deviation is big near the peak of the distribution , while is quite small away from it . in the cases in which serration is not observed , for @xmath146 , the standard deviation is almost constant in time and space . considering this result and",
    "that , in particular for @xmath147 , the time ratio @xmath125 ( see tab .  [ time_scales ] ) is the same as for the case @xmath88 , and that the average curve is constant in time , we can conclude that when serration disappear , this means that dislocations depin in a incoherent way ( at different times ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we can see a representative portion of dislocations and pinning centers motion in the case in which serration is not present ( a ) , and that in which it appears ( b ) .",
    "the dark lines are dislocations .",
    "they have a slope equal to @xmath90 , unless small deviations in correspondence of pinning centers ( the green lines ) pinning dislocations . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b the vertical dotted and dashed red lines correspond to times for which the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively .",
    "the minimum in the average stress correspond to many dislocations that are pinned , while the successive maximum to many dislocations that depin .",
    "these processes are also present at intermediate times , that cause the appearance of small oscillations in the average stress between a big peak and a big valley ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) ) .",
    "the dashed blu line , @xmath148 , indicates the drift of pinning centers that move with velocity @xmath149 .",
    "this drift is caused by the interaction with dislocations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we can see the entire dynamics of all dislocations in a case in which there is not serration ( a ) , and another in which it appears ( b ) . in particular , the term @xmath150 is subtracted to dislocation positions , so we have horizontal lines , while in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we have lines with a slope equal to @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the position of dislocations are rescaled in order to have that the average inter - distance between them is 0.5 instead of @xmath95 .",
    "this last rescaling has been done to evidence the fluctuations of dislocations position .",
    "like in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the vertical dotted and dashed red lines correspond to times for which the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively . from fig .",
    "[ fig6]b we can see essentially two interesting things : minimum and maximum values in the rescaled dislocations position correspond to maximum and minimum values in the average stress respectively ; and the fluctuation profile of the position of one dislocation ( in correspondence of serration ) can propagate with a velocity of @xmath151 .",
    "this last point means that when pinning centers start to clustering , they remain usually clustered during the entire dynamics .",
    "the dashed blue line @xmath152x=-0.875\\cdot10^{-4}x$ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b indicate this behavior of pinning centers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we display the superposition of fluctuations in the position of all dislocations , @xmath153 , in a case in which there is no serration ( a ) and another in which it appears ( b ) .",
    "these fluctuations has been obtained as : @xmath154 , where the time average is performed on the entire dynamics .",
    "we also display the average of all @xmath153 with the relative standard deviation , and the vertical dotted and dashed lines correspond to times for which the average stress has a minimum and a maximum respectively .",
    "we can see another time that the minimum and maximum values of the average fluctuation position correspond to the maximum and minimum in the average stress respectively .",
    "we investigated the dynamics of a dislocation assembly interacting with mobile impurities studying the case of a one - dimensional dislocation pileup . in order to connect this model to the plc effect",
    ", we studied the stress response of the system under an external constant strain rate .",
    "the free parameters of the system have been reduced to the driving velocity @xmath3 , that controls the imposed constant strain rate , the mobility ratio @xmath101 between dislocations and mobile impurities , and the temperature @xmath89 . to this end , we have employed an effective definition of temperature that should be valid except for low temperatures and high stresses . analysing the average stress of the system @xmath86 in the parameter space ( @xmath155 )",
    ", we found a region characterized by stationary fluctuations in the stress ( serration ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the interpretation for the onset of serration in the present model agrees with the general concept of dsa but takes explicitly into account the role of dislocation mutual interactions .",
    "the emergence of serration corresponds to the situation in which impurities diffuse at a rate that allows them to pin dislocations ( i.e. the capturing time @xmath122 is not too high ) . at the same time dislocations",
    "should be able to escape from pinning centers after an aging time @xmath123 which implies that @xmath123 is not too high , otherwise when dislocations unpin , they would move at large speed until they are arrested again and pinning centers will not be able to reach them , but also not too small , because in this case pinning centers will not be able to pin dislocations .",
    "serration correspond to the case in which the two characteristic time scales , @xmath123 and @xmath122 , are of the same order of magnitude ( see tab .",
    "[ time_scales ] ) .    from another point of view , the origin of serration , in a specific range of parameter values ( @xmath156 ) , is due to the localization of impurities in a limited number of clouds under the action of dislocation induced stresses and to the possibility for dislocations to escape from their pinning clouds without randomizing excessively the spatial distribution of impurities .",
    "the spatial localization of pinning centers is only possible due to the coherent action of several interacting dislocations .",
    "if we randomize the interaction between dislocations , for instance by choosing burgers vectors @xmath43 for each dislocation @xmath44 from a random distribution , serration disappears .",
    "spatial randomization of pinning centers results in an incoherent contribution to the total stress fluctuations of each dislocation and in the impossibility to form clouds of pinning centers and therefore in the disappearance of serration . only when the contribution of each dislocation to the total stress fluctuations are coherent , serration is observed .",
    "in order to extend the validity of the definition of temperature and generalize the present model , the following effects could be introduced : _",
    "i ) _ a viscosity therm for dislocations ; _ ii ) _ pinning centers with different mobilities .",
    "the last modification could give different type of serration like in experiments in which three types of bands can be identified ( type a , b , c ) @xcite .",
