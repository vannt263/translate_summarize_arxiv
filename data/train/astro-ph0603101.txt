    "intense astronomical interest has been focused on type ia supernovae since it was recognized long ago @xcite that they are good `` standard candles '' and hence are useful cosmological probes .",
    "the reliability of sne ia as distance indicators improved significantly with the realization that the luminosity at peak was correlated with the width of the light curve @xcite and hence that sne  ia are correctable candles in much the same way that cepheids are @xcite . with the discovery of the `` dark energy '' this interest has been further piqued @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we still do nt know what the stellar progenitors for sne ia are , nor how they evolve with redshift .",
    "in addition , hydrodynamical modeling of sne ia explosions has now entered the sophisticated realm of fully 3-d hydro models @xcite . in spite of the sophistication of the modeling , the enormous dynamic range involved in modeling the fully turbulent flame propagation still requires the use of sub - grid models , or direct numerical simulation of small portions of the star @xcite .",
    "in addition the 3-d models produce results that at first sight appear to be worse representations of the true phenomenon than the highly parameterized 1-d models .",
    "deflagration models in particular appear to lead to ejecta configurations where unburnt c+o is mixed with burned material in such a way that the spectra produced by these models would differ significantly with observations .",
    "@xcite showed that late - time spectra of a particular 3-d deflagration model would lead to strong [ c  i ] and [ o  i ] lines about 300 days after explosion that are unobserved in sne  ia .",
    "the propensity for 3-d deflagration models to leave unburned c+o in the center has led to the suggestion that a detonation to deflagration transition @xcite or a confined detonation @xcite is required to make the 3-d hydrodynamical models look more like the 1-d models which have stratified compositions .    clearly",
    "the goal of sne  ia explosion modeling is to perform full 3-d radiation hydrodynamics simulations with full reaction networks . given present computer resources such realistic calculations are not yet feasible .",
    "some parameterized 3-d synthetic spectral calculations have been performed @xcite , but calculations involving full detailed line and continuum nlte still can only be performed in spherical symmetry .",
    "in previous work we have studied the detailed nlte synthetic spectra of the parameterized 1-d model w7 @xcite as well as the synthetic spectra produced by 1-d delayed detonation models @xcite using the detailed generalized stellar atmosphere code ` phoenix `   @xcite . since that work , several improvements have been made to the ` phoenix `  code and more 1-d delayed detonation models have been calculated . in particular , more species have been added into nlte in ` phoenix ` , and the treatment of the large dynamic range required to treat multiple ionization stages in nlte has been improved through the use of up to 256-bit precision in solving the linear system for the rate equations , and in the eos , making use of the qd package @xcite .",
    "thus , up - to - date calculations should provide a better representation of the actual synthetic spectrum predicted by a particular hydrodynamical model .",
    "the hydrodynamic model we use is a somewhat modified version of the model presented in @xcite in that we have extended the c+o layer from 22,000  @xmath0to 30,000  @xmath0using a density law @xmath1 with @xmath2  @xmath0 .",
    "the extension is necessary in order to for the model to be optically thin in the uv and for it to reproduce the high velocity features that have been found in numerous sne  ia ( for example * ? ? ?",
    ". this extension does not affect the total mass of the model .",
    "consequently , it makes sense to reexamine the synthetic spectra of both w7 and modern delayed detonation models .",
    "here we focus on two particular delayed detonation models of @xcite 5p0z22.25 which has @xmath3 and 5p0z22.16 which has @xmath4 ( see table 2 of * ? ? ?",

    "they found that this model did a reasonably good job of reproducing the + 5 day spectrum of sn  1992a and the maximum light spectrum of sn  1981b , but they treated only ca  ii , mg  ii , and na  i in nlte .",
    "@xcite used the fully stratified w7 hydro model and improved gamma - ray deposition to model a time series of spectra of sn  1994d .",
    "the species treated in nlte were : h  i , he  i - ii , c  i , o  i , ne  i , na  i , mg  ii , si  ii , s  ii , ti  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii .",
    "they also used an earlier version of ` phoenix `  which did not handle the dynamic range associated with multiple ionization stages in nlte in as sophisticated a manner as does the current version . in that work",
    "they were able to obtain acceptable fits to sn  1994d with w7 , up until about march 18 ( -3 days ) .",
    "after that epoch the quality of the fits deteriorated significantly , and prior to march 15 , 1994 , the ca h+k feature was poorly fit by w7 .",
    "we have chosen to model the two supernovae that we had previously modeled , sn  1992a and sn  1994d , and the very well - observed sn  1999ee .",

    "this suggests that for spectra formation near maximum light the amount of nickel produced is not so important ( if there is enough energy to reach the luminosity required ) . for the slow decliner 5p0z22.25 , the lineshapes are overall not bad , but the continuum is too blue , particularly to the blue of ca  ii h+k",

    "the fit is not bad , the ca  ii h+k is too slow , but the overall continuum shape is reasonably well reproduced , for the 10,500  k model .",
    "it is possible that slow decliners have somewhat higher densities ( which leads to higher opacities and thus longer risetimes ) . to test this we calculated a uniform model but at an earlier time .",

    "although some of the lines are too narrow the fit is not bad , and the lines are forming at the right velocities .",
    "a model with an increased density can produce a reasonable fit .",
    "the narrowness of the lines in our synthetic spectrum is due to the choice of a steeper density profile , the lines could be made wider with a shallower density profile .",
    "the availability of an hst spectrum of sn  1992a provides a good opportunity to look at a broader wavelength range .",

    "the fit is adequate , the overall shape of the spectrum is well reproduced , but most of the lines and continua do not fit well .",
    "as we have showed above , the optical spectra of w7 are similar in many respects to those of the delayed - detonation models , nevertheless the distribution of the energy over a wider wavelength region is significantly different . figure  [ fig : w7_v_pah_day20 ] compares the day 20 spectra of w7 , 5p0z22.16 and 5p0z22.25 where all models have the same bolometric magnitude . clearly the w7 spectrum has a much smaller uv deficit than do the delayed - detonation models .",
    "this is illustrated in table  [ tab : mags ] where the absolute magnitudes in a wide range of photometric bands is listed . clearly w7 is much bluer than the delayed detonation models even though we have kept @xmath37 fixed .",

    "the densities in the inner parts are nearly identical for all the models , w7 exhibits a characteristic `` bump '' where the deflagration dies out around 15,000 @xmath0 , and the delayed detonation models have significantly higher densities than w7 in the outer parts .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamdep_w7_v_pah_day20 ] compares the gamma - ray deposition function at day 20 of w7 to 5p0z22.16 and 5p0z22.25 , except for the pronounced dip at the deflagration to detonation transition the shape of the deposition function is very similar to that of w7 , particularly for model 5p0z22.25 , which is about the same nickel mass as w7 .",
    "in fact it is interesting to note that we obtained our best fit to sn 1994d at maximum light with model 5p0z22.16 which has only about 0.27  @xmath48  of , not enough to produce the observed brightness of normal sne  ia .",
    "it is not easy to identify exactly why the si  ii line absorption trough is too blue in w7 ( and to a lesser extent in the delayed detonation models ) .",
    "it is tempting to point to the steep outer density gradient in w7 as the primary difference , however the uniform - composition models have an even steeper density gradient in the outer parts than does w7 and they in fact , fit the si ii feature best .",

    "the obvious difference between w7 and the other two models is that fe  iii / fe  ii and si  iii / si  ii strongly increases with velocity in w7 , whereas it is nearly flat in both the delayed detonation model and in the uniform composition model .",
    "@xcite found good fits to the si  ii @xmath7 feature of sn 2002bo near maximum light , using the density profile of w7 , but varying the compositions .",
    "they also found that they needed more iron in the outer parts of the atmosphere than w7 has .",
    "interestingly , even with a large number of parameters , they were nt able to well reproduce the sulfur `` w '' feature .",
    "@xcite use a parameterized schuster - schwarzschild model and the sobolev approximation and thus do not solve the full nlte radiative transfer problem .",
    "however , they have fit the composition structure of by running a very large set of models ( their code , with its simpler assumptions requires significantly less computer resources than do our models ) .",
    "thus , given the fact that that they have altered the abundances in the model to get the best fit , they still do not reproduce the sulfur w , which leads us to suspect that it is the density structure ( in a complicated combination with the abundances ) that produces this feature and that is just what we have attempted to describe in this work .",
    "both the blue color of w7 and the fact that higher ionization stages increase with velocity leads us to conclude that w7 is `` over - ionized '' .",
    "this is not due to increased gamma - ray deposition as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : gamdep_w7_v_pah_day20 ] , but rather due to the steep density fall - off , or more correctly the steep fall - off of iron in the outer parts of w7 .",
    "this steep fall - off in the iron abundance significantly reduces the uv deficit and thus there are more ionizing photons available to ionize the outer parts of the atmosphere .",
    "it is clear ( see for example figure  [ fig : w7_99ee_oct18_day20_uniform ] ) that the blue part of the spectrum is extremely sensitive to the outer boundary condition ( the total bolometric luminosity in the observer s frame ) , thus the failure to fit the si ii and s ii features seems to be generic to the models and not just an artifact of our choice of @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite found that si  iii was required in a velocity range from about 10,00017,000 @xmath0  and that si  ii was required from about 8,00022,000 @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppres_si ] shows that all the models have significant si  ii - iii all the way out to the outermost layers of the atmosphere .",
    "that si  ii @xmath7 forms at high velocity in w7 even though the ratio of si  iii / si  ii is increasing is not surprising .",
    "the lower level is at 8.2ev , so some ionization actually will strengthen this line .",
    "also , as we discuss in detail in a future publication ( s.  bongard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) the actual line profile of the si  ii @xmath30 and si  ii @xmath6 lines is more likely due to complex radiative transfer effects involving fe  ii and fe  iii lines .",
    "@xcite studied the early spectra of sn  2005cg and concluded that the triangular shaped si  ii@xmath7  feature was a unique prediction of the delayed - detonation models .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : w7_94d_mar21 ] clearly shows that w7 produces just such a line as late as maximum light . a direct confrontation of the spectra of w7 and the delayed - detonation models with the spectra of sn  2005cg will be the subject of future work .",
    "overall both the highly parameterized deflagration model w7 and the delayed detonation models that we have studied provide about equally good fits to spectra of normal sne  ia near maximum light .",
    "the quality of the fit to near maximum light spectra is not strongly dependent on the distributiion of nickel ( or gamma - ray deposition ) for the delayed detonation models ( although we have forced the models to have the `` right '' luminosity , which is not self - consistent ) .",
    "w7 produces spectra that are both too blue , and where the si  ii @xmath7 line ( the defining feature of sne  ia ) is significantly too fast .",
    "this appears to be due to the rapid fall - off in the amount of iron in the outer layers of w7 and can be remedied either by flattening the density profile , or by increasing the relative fraction of iron .",
    "our best fit model for the si  ii@xmath7  feature near maximum had uniform compositions and a steeper overall density decrease than w7 , which shows that the blue wing of the si  ii feature found in w7 is due to material at high velocity and can be supressed simply by removing that material . clearly",
    "successful hydrodynamical models of sne  ia require stratified compositions , nevertheless somewhat larger amounts of iron ( whether it be primordial or produced in the ejecta ) seem to help .",
    "the delayed detonation models did a better job at reproducing the observed position of the si  ii @xmath7 line and simply have a flatter density profile , so that may be an indication that flatter density profiles , as well as more iron in the outer layers is required .",
