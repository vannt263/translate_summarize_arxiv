    "in the milky way galaxy , 21 cm observations of neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) provide a unique probe of the structure and dynamics of the interstellar medium . @xcite and others have identified clumps of  emission with motions that are inconsistent with galactic rotation . formally , these high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are identified by either having a line of sight velocity , @xmath6 , greater than 90  kms@xmath1  with respect to the local standard of rest or else differ from the rotational velocity of the disk by greater than 50  kms@xmath1at a given galactic longitude .",
    "despite over 40 years of study , the origin of these hvcs remains a mystery .",
    "our position within the milky way s disk provides a unique perspective of their spatial distribution .",
    "however , because the clouds do not obey galactic rotation , distance measurements rely on the serendipitous position of stars and stellar spectroscopy to find distance brackets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or other coincidences , such as the association of the magellanic stream with the magellanic clouds , or the interaction of smith s cloud @xcite and the magellanic stream @xcite with the galactic disk",
    ". other hvcs may be tidal debris ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such coincidences yield distances to individual hvcs of order 10 kpc , but are quite rare and tell us little about the population as a whole .",
    "accurate distances to  clouds allow us to calculate their masses and to map their positions about the galaxy and thereby differentiate between several hvc formation scenarios , which in turn have implications for cosmology and structure formation , chemical enrichment , and halo dynamics .    to explain the pervasive structure of galactic hvcs across the sky , one must invoke multiple explanations .",
    "the magellanic stream is likely the result of tidal interactions with the large and small magellanic clouds . for other hvcs , @xcite and",
    "@xcite postulated that a galactic fountain mechanism could be responsible for raising hot gas into the galactic halo where it would cool , condense , and then rain back down on the disk .",
    "meanwhile , proposed that these  clouds are primordial left - overs that are just now being accreted by the milky way .",
    "this theory was revived recently by @xcite and who suggested that some types of hvcs were associated with low mass dark matter halos seen in models of @xmath7cdm galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "hvcs may also be produced by a cooling , condensing hot halo ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these theories have different predictions for the mass distribution , the vertical distance from the disk , and the metallicity for the clouds .",
    "but in either case , their presence would not be unique to our own galaxy : in order to gain insight into the galactic hvc population we observe other nearby spiral galaxies .    as the closest large spiral galaxy to the milky way ,",
    "m  31 is an excellent test bed in which to search for hvc analogs .",
    "@xcite find @xmath8 discrete objects within 50 kpc of the m  31 disk which range in  mass between @xmath9 and @xmath2 @xmath3  and can be characterized by a steep power law distribution .",
    "the authors suggest that these clouds may trace the dark matter halos around m  31 that are predicted from @xmath7cdm models .",
    "however , many of the clouds show velocity continuity implying that they may be tidal remnants associated with the stellar stream of m  31 , or part of the bridge between m  31 and m  33 .    observing edge - on galaxies",

    "studies of ngc  891 and other nearly edge - on galaxies imply that there is a significant link between the amount of star formation in the disk ( as measured by h@xmath15 or radio continuum ) , and the properties of the lagging halo , which is believed to be evidence for gas circulation by a galactic fountain ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in general , they find that the scale height and the velocity gradient decrease with increasing star formation rate . unfortunately , observations of edge - on galaxies are unable to tell us about either the position of clouds around the disk , or their vertical motion  the latter of which plays a part in identifying hvcs in the milky way",

    "given a healthy star formation rate , it would not be surprising to find evidence for a lagging  disk ; its inclination allows us to investigate the position and kinematics of clouds with respect to the galactic disk in simple rotation . with these observations we identify extraplanar  and hvc analogs associated with galactic fountains , galaxy formation , and tidal debris and use the characteristics of such hvcs to discriminate between their possible origins .",

    "however , the intensity weighted velocity map looks fairly well behaved ; there is no direct evidence that the galaxy has been disturbed by a strong encounter .",

    "in addition , in order to understand the quality of our assumption that the disk is flat and ideal , we re - fit the rotation curve allowing the inclination and the position angle to vary while keeping the rotational velocity fixed to the value found for each ring in the tilted ring model .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure [ rotcur ] show how the inclination and position angle , respectively , vary with radius . in these instances the rotational velocity for each ring is fixed to the value plotted in the top panel .",
    "there is evidence that ngc  2997 deviates from the ideal , flat disk .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ rotcur ] suggests that we were unable to fit a self - consistent rotation curve with a uniform position angle because it declines steadily with radius . in the tilted - ring model , inclination and rotation velocity",
    "are coupled through a @xmath41 term .",
    "this makes for a degeneracy between a flat inclination and falling rotation curve that is particularly strong for low inclination galaxies .",

    "the two bottom panels demonstrate the quality of our assumption that ngc  2997 is an ideal , flat disk .",
    "we keep all other parameters fixed but allow the inclination ( middle ) and position angle ( bottom ) to vary  the rotational velocity for each tilted ring is fixed to the value found in the top panel . the declining position angle with radius",
    "suggests we were unable to ft a self - consistent rotation curve . ]",
    "our deep observations of ngc  2997 show that the  gas is not confined to the thin disk . in p - v slices",
    "the contours of  emission show a shallow gradient towards the systemic velocity : a feature which has been identified in a small number of other galaxies and has been referred to as a `` beard '' .",
    "after modeling the dominant  component , we subtract the thin disk from the original data cube and find that @xmath43 @xmath3  of residual emission remains  about 18% of the total @xmath27  of the galaxy .",
    "this second component can be fit by a gaussian with a higher velocity dispersion than the thin disk ( @xmath26  kms@xmath1 ) which reflects the thermal motions of the gas convolved with a vertical velocity gradient @xcite .",
    "the peak velocity of the fitted gaussian resides closer to the systemic velocity of the galaxy than gas in the thin disk at the same radius . in other words , it appears to follow galactic rotation , but at slower rotational velocities .",
    "we fit a second rotation curve to the residual data by assuming that this thick disk has the same large - scale morphology as the thin disk , with the same systemic velocity ( 1089  kms@xmath1 ) , position angle ( 107@xmath44 ) and inclination ( 32@xmath44 ) . from figure [ rotcur2 ]",
    "we see that peaks in the two rotation curves roughly coincide with one another , implying that they are related , however the thick disk consistently lags behind that of the thin disk by @xmath31  kms@xmath1 .",
    "a similar lagging disk has been observed in ngc  891 ( @xmath45  kms@xmath1 ; @xcite ) and ngc  2403 ( @xmath16  kms@xmath1 ; ) .",
    "to understand this relation we also attempted to derive the thick disk rotation curve from the residual data without assuming it has the same properties as the thin disk .",
    "while we successfully fit a position angle ( @xmath46 ) , we were unable to find a consistent inclination .",
    "in ngc  2403 , @xcite show that a rotated position angle , such as this can be explained by an overall inflow of the anomalous gas .",
    "however , as we find no other evidence for radial gas motion when we include it in our models of ngc  2997 , we disregard it .",
    "we took this kinematic modeling a step further by adding a velocity gradient to the rotation curve as a function of height above the disk mid - plane .",
    "we followed similar procedures to those demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gipsy task galmod allows one to create a model data cube from user supplied parameters : the rotational velocity , the scale height and the surface density .",
    "a modified version of this task ( heald , 2008 , private communication ) includes two additional parameters to specify ( 1 ) the rate of change in velocity , @xmath47 , with height , @xmath48 , and ( 2 ) a cylindrical height above the disk at which the gradient begins , @xmath49 , such that the rotation of the gas is described by the following equations : @xmath50 we examined p - v slices along the galaxy s major axis to compare the models created from the modified galmod task with our data ( figure [ models ] ) .",
    "the cylindrical height was the easiest parameter to fit .",
    "it is defined as the distance from the mid - plane at which the velocity gradient begins . setting its value has the effect of imposing the velocity at which the peak of the emission occurs .",
    "for example , with a smaller cylindrical height the velocity gradient begins closer to the mid - plane and , for an inclined galaxy , the resulting sum of emission projected along the line of sight appears to shift towards lower velocities .",
    "a cylindrical height of @xmath51 kpc fits our data best .",
    "this is within the range of values derived for other galaxies : @xcite report values ranging from 0.4 kpc in ngc  4302 to 1.2 kpc in ngc  5775 using h@xmath15 kinematics of ionized gas ; while @xcite report a value of 1.3 kpc for ngc  891 in .",
    "the value of the scale height predominately influences the lowest level  contours of the p - v diagram .",
    "a large scale height places more emitting material at greater distances from the disk and , therefore , at lower velocities with respect to the rotational velocity at the mid - plane so the  contours become shallower toward the systemic velocity with increasing scale height .",
    "the best fit for the scale height is @xmath52 kpc .",
    "our errors are based on the resolution of parameter space sampled and the degree to which the models differed significantly by eye .",
    "the model is least sensitive to the velocity gradient , probably due to ngc  2997 s relatively low inclination and the low column density of the gas in the lagging disk . varying this value changes the gradient of the  contours in the model",
    ", however it does so less dramatically than varying the scale height .",
    "this , combined with the clumpiness of the  due to spiral arms and other features in the disk , make it difficult to estimate a good fit .",
    "we estimate the velocity gradient to be between @xmath0  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 .",
    "again , these values fall in the range reported for ngc  4302 ( @xmath53  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 ; @xcite ) , ngc  5775 ( 8  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 ; @xcite ) , and ngc  891 ( 15  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .     between the rotation curves",

    "the clouds we identify reside within 20 kpc from the center of the galaxy , which places them within the extent of the projected  disk , but outside the optical disk as it is seen in dss images ( figure [ moment ] ) , and they all have  masses of approximately @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "they were not detected by @xcite because of the low angular resolution of their parkes ( 14 ) and atca ( @xmath62 ) data .",
    "there are significant indications of a larger population of  clouds around ngc  2997 , however we are less confident in their identification because they are closer to our mass sensitivity limit and because of residual phase calibration errors in the data cube .",
    "in addition to the  clouds , there are two other prominent features of anomalous  we see in velocity channels : a `` spur '' of counter - rotating gas near the center of the galaxy and a `` tail '' of emission lagging in rotation , extending to the west from the north half of the galaxy . unlike the  clouds which are distinct , both of these features are connected to the main disk of the galaxy ( making it difficult to estimate their mass ) .",

    "the same feature looks like a shell of emission that is connected to the disk ( figure [ allslices]b , c & d ) .",

    "in addition to the thin disk of ngc  2997 , seen in most spiral galaxies , we have identified two additional  components that are not as ubiquitous : a lagging , thick disk and anamolous  clouds .",
    "the thick disk has a mass of @xmath43 @xmath3 , a broader velocity dispersion , @xmath26  kms@xmath1 , and lags behind the rotational velocity of the thin disk by @xmath31  kms@xmath1 .",
    "the anomalous  clouds are spatially or kinematically distinct from both  disk components .",
    "the clouds have individual masses between @xmath74@xmath3 , are offset from the disk by @xmath75  kms@xmath1and , in some instances , are counter - rotating . in this section we compare our results with the distribution of  observed around other galaxies , we speculate on the possible origins of ngc  2297 s hvc analogs , we discuss our results in the context of the local group hvcs , and we examine the effect of our distance estimate on our conclusions .",
    "ngc  2997 is one of the lowest inclination galaxies in which a lagging disk has been modeled .",
    "it is impossible to do this same decomposition for a face - on galaxy because the measured velocities contain no information on the rotation of the gas , but moderate to high inclination galaxies are well suited to this analysis .",
    "the velocity gradient we estimate for ngc  2997 , @xmath0  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 , appears to be typical of spiral galaxies for which deep observations reveal extended extraplanar gas .",
    "our findings are consistent with that seen in ngc  2403 where @xcite calculate the thick disk to have a mean rotation velocity @xmath16  kms@xmath1  lower than that of the thin disk , in ngc  4459 where find a thick disk that lags by @xmath76  kms@xmath1 , and in ngc  891 , where the velocity gradient ranges from 14 to 43  kms@xmath1  kpc@xmath1 depending on the location in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "ngc  6946 also has a similar lagging halo of cold gas @xcite .",
    "this range of values for the velocity gradient in spiral galaxies suggests that one might correlate it with star formation activity . @xcite",
    "have done a complementary study of three high inclination galaxies , ngc  5775 , ngc  891 , and ngc  4302 , in which they find that the magnitude of the velocity gradient , measured in ionized gas ( h@xmath15 ) , decreases with star formation activity , as measured in far infrared luminosity . for ngc  2997",
    ", we calculate a star formation rate of @xmath4 @xmath3  yr@xmath1 from 60 and 100 @xmath77 m iras fluxes ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath78 ghz fluxes ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is unclear how well ngc  2997 supports such a correlation : its values for the velocity gradient and scale height are close to the mean of those galaxies , while the star formation rate is a bit high .",
    "@xcite also suggest that the product of the velocity gradient and the scale height tends towards @xmath79  kms@xmath1 .",
    "we estimate @xmath80  kms@xmath1 , which is consistent with their suggestion .    from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the detection of a thick , lagging disk is consistent with the idea developed by @xcite in which the galactic hvcs are clouds condensing out of a hot galactic corona fed by supernovae in the disk . in his galactic fountain model ,",
    "gas blown out of the disk by star formation moves radially outward and slows down to conserve angular momentum as it moves vertically away from the mid - plane .",
    "if the observed lag is only due to conservation of angular momentum then , in the case of ngc  2997 , gas that lags by 60  kms@xmath1  behind a disk rotating at 200  kms@xmath1  originated 70% closer to the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , if hydrodynamic effects are important , the radial motion is less dramatic",
    ". cooling gas condenses out of the corona and moves inward again .",
    "evidence for radial inflow of @xmath81  kms@xmath1  has been observed in ngc  2403 @xcite and perhaps in ngc  4559 .",
    "we do not find evidence for radial inflow of  in ngc  2997 , but such a signature may be ambiguous due to the low inclination of the galaxy .",
    "radially infalling clouds would also be expected if these clouds originated in a cooling hot galactic halo that is at the virial temperature of the dark matter halo as proposed by @xcite , however holes in the  disk may be evidence that supernovae are responsible for circulating this gas .    in a number of cases where we see anomalous  clouds in p - v slices , we also see depressions in the  column density in the disk ( slices b & d ) .",
    "these  `` holes '' occur near the outskirts of the  disk , but outside of the optical disk , and we hesitate at calling them holes because they frequently occur between two  spiral arms",
    ". these may be sites where  has been blown out of the disk from supernovae , however one can not rule out that these may also be the result of a dwarf galaxy that has impacted the disk .",
    "for example , this may be the case for large holes in ngc  6946 @xcite and m  101 @xcite . in any case , it is interesting to note that all of the anomalous  we identify is coincident with the  disk and we do not find any large  clouds far from it .",
    "the large clouds of counter - rotating  gas and the `` spur '' can not be explained by a galactic fountain mechanism . while fountain gas lags behind the main disk in rotation , it will conserve angular momentum and so",
    "can not be counter - rotating .",
    "additionally , to eject clouds of @xmath2 @xmath3  from the disk at the observed velocity offsets requires an spatially and temporally coherent injection of @xmath82 ergs of energy .",
    "this corresponds to of order @xmath83 supernovae , assuming 10% efficiency .",
    "despite the star formation rate of ngc  2997 , this appears to be implausibly high . based on this energy argument , and their position with respect to the optical disk ,",
    "we conclude that these  features are more likely material being accreted by ngc  2997 , either out of a hot galactic halo @xcite , or are the remnants of a tidally disrupted gas rich dwarf galaxy .",
    "the maximum individual cloud mass from the @xcite simulations is @xmath84 @xmath3 , however they do not rule out the possibility of cloud complexes having higher masses .",
    "we estimate a lower limit for the total accretion rate of @xmath85 @xmath3  yr@xmath1 , which may help sustain the vigorous star formation rate , especially if it is augmented by gas from the lagging disk which one would expect to eventually fall back towards the mid - plane .",
    "features such as the asymmetry in the extended northwest spiral arm are usually interpreted as evidence for past interactions between galaxies , and there are two possible culprits .",
    "the nearest lgg  180 group galaxy is a dwarf galaxy , eso  434-g041 , which is @xmath86 kpc to the southeast .",
    "it is resolved in our atca observations , but lies outside the primary beam of the gmrt .",
    "ned lists another dwarf galaxy , eso  434-g030 , @xmath87 kpc to the southwest , but we do not see this galaxy in our data . assuming that the velocity differences in the plane of the sky are similar to the line - of - sight velocity differences between these galaxies and ngc  2997 , any encounter would have taken place @xmath62 gyr ago .",
    "while there are no apparent connections between these galaxies and ngc  2997 in , nor any optical signatures of disturbances in the dwarf galaxies , a past tidal event or interaction seems to be the most likely explanation for pulling such a large amount of  from the disk in such a coherent manner , causing the asymmetry . on the other hand",
    ", we do not believe that interactions are the most probable origin for the anamolous  clouds .",
    "similarly , the `` tail '' feature , on the northwest side of the galaxy , seems best explained by accretion  perhaps a dwarf galaxy that has been tidally disrupted as it passed near ngc  2997 .",
    "we have identified the most massive anomalous  clouds associated with ngc  2297 .",
    "these five clouds have masses of order @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum of cloud masses extends to lower masses but , in many cases , it is difficult to separate them as distinct from emission in the thick disk . nonetheless , we can still compare the clouds we have identified with those reported in the local group and around other galaxies .",
    "the  mass distribution of clouds in m  31 given by dm(@xmath27 ) @xmath88 @xmath27@xmath89d@xmath27 , allows us to estimate the total number of similar clouds we should expect to see around ngc  2997 .",
    "most clouds have masses in the range @xmath90 @xmath3  with only davies cloud having @xmath27  @xmath91 @xmath3",
    ". for sources smaller than our beamsize , seen by @xcite we would expect to detect about 10 of the m  31 hvc analogs at the 5@xmath20 level ( and about 4 above the 10@xmath20 level ) ; for those clouds that we could resolve , we lack the column density sensitivity to detect them .",
    "however , we already know from the observations of @xcite that there are no low column density   clouds residing off the disk of ngc  2997 .",
    "the hvcs discovered around m  31 in higher resolution images by have an average size of 1 kpc ( equivalent to the size of our beam at the distance of ngc  2997 ) and are below our detection limits .    with recently determined distant brackets to milky way hvcs",
    ", we can put our  clouds into a local context .",
    "for complex c , @xcite estimate @xmath27  to be @xmath92 @xmath3 .",
    "the  masses for four other clouds range from @xmath93 @xmath3   ( cloud g1 ) to @xmath94 @xmath3  ( complex gcp ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , at the distance of ngc  2997 , we are only sensitive to the most massive milky way hvcs for which distance measurements exist .",
    "however , we also see more massive features ( @xmath95 @xmath3 ) for which their are few counterparts around the milky way and m  31 .",
    "nonetheless , our discoveries are consistent with anomalous  clouds observed in other galaxies .",
    "the distribution of  clouds we find around ngc  2997 can be used to place limits on cosmological and large scale structure simulations for the number of small dark matter halos around massive galaxies .",
    "the  masses we calculate depend on the square of the assumed distance to the galaxy . however , local large scale structure results in an inaccurate distance estimate to ngc  2997 because its peculiar velocity is not dominated by hubble flow . unfortunately ,",
    "an attempt to correct for this , the velocity flow model of @xcite , is sparsely populated by galaxies in the volume around ngc  2997 , so we choose to calculate the distance to ngc  2997 using the tully - fisher relation ( hereafter tf )",
    ".    the tf relations based on near infrared observations may be the most reliable because they are less impacted by dust than optical magnitudes .",
    "we retrieved the 2mass j , h , and k - band magnitudes from ned and used the bias corrected tf parameters specific to sc galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 ) : @xmath96 to estimate the internal extinction , we interpolated between i and k bands to get values for j and h using the formulae in @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of the h  i profile ( @xmath97  kms@xmath1 ) comes from parkes observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pisano et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , corrected for instrumental effects , turbulent motions , cosmological broadening , and inclination as per the formula in @xcite . from these 2mass tf relations we derive a mean distance of @xmath5 mpc .",
    "this new distance estimate places ngc  2997 about 10% closer to the milky way than the estimates found on ned , corrected for peculiar velocity due to local density enhancements , and 18% closer than the velocity flow model of @xcite .",
    "this places somewhat tighter constraints on the fact that we do not see a large population of  clouds outside the disk of ngc  2997 .",
    "the anomalous  clouds within the disk , for which we calculate masses , become more consistent with those observed around m  31 and more consistent with the mass estimate for complex c in the milky way . despite this closer distance estimate",
    ", the difference between it and previous estimates is not enough to change the formation hypotheses for the individual clouds we identify .",
    "our observations of ngc  2297 reveal a galaxy with a lagging , thick disk and anamolous  clouds in the halo similar to other galaxies , such as ngc  2403 @xcite and ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a lagging disk , which may be caused by star formation activity , and the presence of large  clouds and counter - rotating gas from accretion show that many processes contribute to the distribution of this cold gas .",
    "we propose that the lagging disk is the result of a galactic fountain process in which gas is blown out of the disk by supernovae .",
    "this gas experiences a decreasing gravitational force as it moves away from the mid - plane , so it drifts radially outward . as a result",
    ", this gas rotates in the same sense as the thin disk , but at slower velocities to conserve angular momentum . from iras 60 and 100 @xmath77 m , and 1.4 ghz radio continuum fluxes",
    "we estimate fairly vigorous star formation rate in ngc  2997 of about 5 @xmath3  yr@xmath1 to support the renewal of this lagging disk . of the total   mass of the galaxy ,",
    "@xmath25% resides in this lagging disk .",
    "the most likely origin for the  clouds we discover is accretion from a hot galactic halo or from nearby dark matter halos .",
    "the  cloud masses are of order @xmath2 @xmath3 . from their velocity",
    "offset with respect to nearby disk gas , we estimate a kinetic energy for the clouds relative to the rotation of the disk of @xmath98 ergs and conclude that it is unlikely their presence is due to supernovae",
    ". meanwhile , the spur and tail may be the remnants of tidally disrupted gas rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "the anomalous we identify makes up approximately @xmath99% of the total  mass .",
    "finally , the asymmetry of ngc  2997 to the northwest appears best explained by a tidal interaction with another galaxy , although it is not obvious whom the culprit may be .",
    "the features we find are not out of line with those observed in the local group , nor compared to other galaxies for which similar observations and modeling have been done , although the clouds of ngc  2997 tend to be more massive than the clouds for which we have distance brackets in the milky way , even with an improved distance from the 2mass tully - fisher relations that place ngc  2997 @xmath100% closer . in spite of ngc  2997 s relative isolation , we believe that a number of dynamic processes contribute to the sum of extraplanar  gas , including star formation , accretion , and galaxy interactions .",
    "deeper observations of ngc  2997 as have been accomplished with ngc  891 would likely continue to reveal extended structure .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge george heald for sharing his modified gipsy task to model the lagging disk .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her useful comments and constructive criticism that contributed to the improvement of this paper .",
