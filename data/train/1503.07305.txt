    "the study of strange hadrons in nuclear collisions has since long been considered to be a good probe for the properties of dense hadronic matter @xcite . as",
    "strangeness in nuclear collisions has to be newly produced ( as @xmath5 pair ) , and the strange quark mass is significantly larger than that of the light quarks , it is possible to study near and sub - threshold production of strange hadrons in nuclear collisions at energies where systems of large net baryon density are created @xcite .",
    "the properties of such hot and dense systems are in the focus of current and planned experimental programs at the gsi / fair @xcite , nica @xcite and rhic facilities . because ab initio calculations of qcd ( for example lattice qcd ) are not applicable at such high baryon densities @xcite one has to rely on phenomenological models and comparisons to data to learn about the properties of the dense matter created in these experiments . for this purpose",
    "microscopic transport models are usually employed .",
    "several previous works found that the production rates and properties of kaons , for example are a promising probe to extract their medium interactions in low energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the before mentioned transport models successfully describe kaon production in low energy nuclear collisions by modifying the medium properties of strange hadrons .",
    "however an important difference to the urqmd model , which we will use in our study , is that in urqmd a significant larger number of high mass resonances is included .",
    "a rather phenomenological approach to strangeness production is the so called thermal model .",
    "this model is usually based on a ( grand)-canonical fit to experimentally measured particle ratios or yields and gives surprisingly good results for hadron production at high energies , i.e. @xmath6 gev ( see e.g. @xcite ) . at the low near and sub - threshold energies under investigation at the sis18 accelerator however",
    ", it was found that the thermal model has significant problems describing the set of strange particle ratios measured with the hades experiment @xcite .",
    "this poses the question whether one has to take into account new and interesting physics to describe strange particle production at these low beam energies .    in this work",
    "we will explore new mechanisms for the production of the @xmath0 meson and @xmath7 baryon in the microscopic transport model urqmd . in the urqmd model",
    "most of the particle production at lower beam energies @xmath8 gev takes place by resonance excitation and decay .",
    "therefore we explore new decays of the sort @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the most heavy resonances .",
    "evidence for such channels has recently been put forward in @xcite . as the experimental knowledge of these exotic decays of very heavy baryon resonances is scarce , one has to infer the decay probabilities indirectly .",
    "the probabilities for these decays can be fixed using near threshold production in elementary reactions .",
    "once the production probabilities are fixed we use these to estimate multi - strange hadron production in sub - threshold nuclear collision in order to determine baseline production estimates consistent with elementary reactions , i.e. vacuum physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we will discuss possible mechanisms of particle production in urqmd , with an emphasis on @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadrons .",
    "then we will outline how we introduce a new production channel for these hadrons through the decay of massive @xmath11 states .",
    "we will show how the introduction of these new decays can be used to describe elementary production cross sections near their threshold energies and finally study the effect of these production channels on the deep sub - threshold production of multi - strange hadrons in nuclear collisions .",
    "hadron production in the urqmd transport model @xcite proceeds through different channels : the excitation and de - excitation ( decay ) of hadronic resonances , the excitation and de - excitation of a string and the annihilation of a particle with its anti - particle .",
    "the probabilities of the different processes are governed by their reaction cross sections .",
    "these cross sections serve as input for the model and are , whenever possible , taken from experimental measurements of elementary ( binary ) collisions .",
    "for example the total and inelastic cross section of binary proton+proton collisions has been measured in many experiments over a wide range of beam energies @xcite ( see green circles and black squares in figure [ f0 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding green and black lines in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] serve as input for model .",
    "the difference between the total and elastic cross section therefore should correspond to the inelastic cross section . here again , many different reactions are possible . in urqmd the inelastic part of the nucleon+nucleon cross section ( up to a certain energy ) is described by resonance production channels .",
    "the possible channels of resonance excitations are divided into several classes :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 2 .",
    "@xmath13 3 .",
    "@xmath14 4 .",
    "@xmath15 5 .",
    "@xmath16 6 .",
    "@xmath17 7 .",
    "@xmath18    here @xmath19 could be any excited @xmath11 or @xmath20 state .",
    "since a large part of the channels are not known , or only measured within a limited energy interval one uses an effective parametrization of the different cross sections :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the average momentum of the in- and outgoing particles and @xmath23 are the spins of the outgoing particles .",
    "the matrix element @xmath24 is usually not known for all reactions but can be parametrized to fit experimental measurements , if available . a detailed description on how the elementary cross sections of processes 1 to 6 can be parametrized as well as comparisons with data is shown in detail in @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath18 has just recently been introduced into the model with : @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 was chosen such that the double resonance excitation is consistent with the total and inelastic ( total - elastic ) part of the p+p cross section .",
    "the contribution of double resonance excitation to the p+p cross section is depicted as the blue short - dashed line in figure [ f0 ] .",
    "however , at some center - of - mass energy resonance excitation becomes unable to describe the inelastic cross section measured in experiment .",
    "this increasing difference between the resonance channels and the inelastic cross section is filled with the string excitation channel , which is also shown in figure [ f0 ] as dashed grey line .",
    "one can see that the string channel starts to dominate particle production at beam energies above @xmath27 to @xmath28 gev .",
    "since we are interested in near and sub - threshold particle production the string channel is not relevant for most of the following results , whereas the resonance channels are essential for an understanding of the beam energies we will consider .",
    "another important channel for the description of strange particle production in nuclear collisions is the strangeness exchange reaction which can change the flavor content of a hadron .",
    "this includes reactions of the type @xmath29 as well as @xmath30 .",
    "such reactions are included in the urqmd transport approach , however it was shown that they are not sufficient to explain the large @xmath31 ratio in ar+kcl and p+nb reactions measured with the hades experiment ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "in fact the large @xmath31 ratio in near - threshold p+nb reactions , where strangeness exchange reactions can not contribute , indicates that @xmath7 production occurs as a single step ( direct production ) process .",

    "we also show the total inelastic ( red line ) cross section .",
    "the parts of the inelastic cross section which correspond to the string excitation ( grey dashed line ) and the double resonance @xmath18 channel ( blue dashed line ) are also shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "when discussing sub - threshold production of @xmath0 s and @xmath7 s in nuclear collisions one should note that there are two distinct mechanisms which allow for the production of hadrons with masses , higher than what would be energetically forbidden in elementary reactions :    1 .",
    "one is the fact that in a nucleus , the nucleons acquire a fermi momentum due to their bound state . because of the fermi momenta",
    ", the actual energy of two colliding nucleons will not be exactly the beam energy but a smeared out energy distribution .",
    "this allows for collisions of nucleons at energies higher than the actual beam energy .",
    "furthermore energy can be accumulated due to secondary interactions of already excited states , produced earlier in the collision @xcite .    as an example for deep sub - threshold production of multi - strange hadrons we will first investigate the production probability of resonance states with sufficiently high mass to produce a @xmath0 or @xmath7 in collisions of ca+ca ( corresponding to the ar+kcl collisions studied at the hades experiment ) . in such collisions , from the fermi momenta alone , about two percent of all primary @xmath32 collisions will have an invariant mass large enough to produce a @xmath0 meson , while essentially none has sufficient energy to produce a @xmath7 .",
    "even though a small fraction of initial collisions has sufficient energy to produce a @xmath0 , none can be produced at this energy through a string excitation because in the string picture a @xmath0 can only be created together with a @xmath33 pair , increasing the effective threshold for @xmath0 production by a string fragmentation by an additional 1 gev .",

    "it is clear from this figure that a substantial number of @xmath11 resonances with masses larger than the apparent threshold energy is produced in the nuclear collision .",
    "we also indicate , as vertical lines , the minimal mass a @xmath11 would need in order to decay into a final state with a @xmath0 ( red line ) or even @xmath7 ( black line ) . from this distribution",
    "we conclude that a moderate amount of excited states with sufficiently high mass are available that may produce @xmath0 mesons as well as @xmath7 baryons . in the",
    "following we explore decays of the most massive @xmath11 resonances implemented in urqmd , namely the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels , in order to describe the production of @xmath0 and @xmath7 particles near and below their elementary threshold energies .",
    "in particular we will use the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 states included in the urqmd model , as their decay channels are experimentally not well constrained and they have a sufficiently large mass .",
    "one should note that , by introducing these new decay channels we also naturally , through detailed balance relations , introduce reactions of the kind @xmath46 , where @xmath47 could be any meson that couples to the @xmath11 ( e.g. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) .",
    "such channels have been discussed in @xcite as possible sourced of @xmath0 mesons in nuclear collisions . in @xcite however , the authors determined the relevant cross sections from theoretical models and found that such processes can not fully account for the measured @xmath0 yield . here",
    "we take a different approach and extract the cross sections directly from the comparison with experimental data , i.e. the resonance production in p+p reactions .",
    "this has the advantage that we do not have to rely on the validity of certain model assumptions , while on the other hand we can not predict the @xmath0 meson production in elementary reactions from fundamental calculations .",

    "as a next step we need to determine the probability that a heavy baryonic resonance state decays into the specific final states introduced above . fortunately the anke experiment has recently published a set of data on the cross section of single @xmath0 production in near threshold @xmath52 collisions @xcite .",
    "these cross sections are shown in figure [ f2 ] as black squares . using these data we find , that a branching fraction of @xmath53 , for all the above mentioned @xmath11 resonances , provides a very good description ( red triangles ) of the measured @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "note that we only fit one parameter , the branching fraction , to obtain a description of the data for all three measured beam energies .",
    "one should further note that the extracted branching fraction of @xmath54 is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of other channels like the @xmath55 dacay and therefore compatible with the ozi supression factor experimentally extracted from the @xmath56 production ratio in @xmath52 collisions @xcite .",
    "+ as we discussed above , the new decay channel , through the detailed balance relations , introduced an inelastic @xmath57 absorption channel for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the cross section obtained from our fit is shown in figure [ f9 ] as red dashed line .",
    "the resulting absorption cross section is of the order of less than 1 mb , which is much smaller than what is usually obtained by different experiments .",
    "this apparent inconsistency will be discussed and resolved in section [ absorb ] .    determining a similar branching fraction of @xmath58",
    "is not as straight forward as it is with the @xmath0 decay .",
    "first one should note that the pole masses of all @xmath11 resonances in urqmd are below the threshold for this decay channel ( 2.3 gev ) and therefore the branching fraction will only be non - zero in the high mass tails of the resonances .",
    "secondly there exists no experimental data on @xmath7 production in elementary collisions near its production threshold .",
    "therefore we use the new hades data on @xmath7 production in p+nb reactions as a proxy for the unavailable elementary collision data to fix the @xmath58 branching fraction , as it is the dataset closest to an elementary reaction . to describe the measured production yield of @xmath1 s ( see table [ t1 ] ) we obtain a branching fraction @xmath59 for all @xmath11 states mentioned above , that have a sufficiently high mass for this decay .",
    "a branching fraction of @xmath60 appears to be large , however one should keep in mind that this branching fraction applies only in the high mass tails of the resonances and the integrated fraction is less than one percent .",
    "furthermore one expects that even higher mass resonances , not implemented in the model , do contribute stronger to the @xmath7 production and one can think of this large branching fraction as the effective summed - up contribution of these high mass resonances .",

    "having constrained the branching fractions in the previous section , we employ this new mechanism to estimate the production probabilities of @xmath0 s and @xmath7 s in nuclear collisions , particularly at sub - threshold energies .",
    "a ratio which has shown an interesting beam energy dependence , especially below the @xmath0 production threshold is the @xmath70 ratio , which is shown in figure [ f3 ] for nuclear collisions at different beam energies , measured by several experiments @xcite .",
    "results from our simulations for most central ( @xmath71 fm ) au+au collisions are shown as the red line .",
    "because the @xmath0 is an unstable particle it will never be directly measured in an experiment and therefore it is important to clarify how we define a measurable @xmath0 in our model simulation .",
    "we define a measurable @xmath0 , for all the following results , as a @xmath0 which has decayed into a kaon - anti - kaon pair and whose decay partners have not rescattered . with rescattering we strictly mean no elastic or inelastic scattering of the decay products , noting that there can be a small fraction of @xmath0 s which can be reconstructed even though their decay daughter had an elastic scattering .",
    "however , we expect this correction to be on the order of a few percent .    from the comparison in figure [ f3 ] , it is clearly visible that the qualitative behavior of the data , a rapid increase of the @xmath70 ratio for sub - threshold energies , is nicely reproduced in our simulations . also the value of the ratio is in nice agreement for beam energies at and above the hades ar+kcl data with @xmath34 a gev as well as the fopi results for ni+ni collisions at @xmath72 a gev",
    ". however , one also observes that above the low sps energy regime the present model underpredicts the @xmath70 ratio .",
    "this can be understood as a result of the above mentioned high threshold for @xmath0 production in the string break - up . because string excitation dominate the particle production at beam energies above @xmath6 gev",

    "of course if the non-@xmath0 @xmath63 production is changed .",
    "e.g. due to a modification of the exchange reaction cross section , then also the @xmath0/@xmath63 ratio will change , i.e. the @xmath63/@xmath76 and @xmath63/@xmath77 ratios , which should also change if only the @xmath63 inelastic cross section is modified . these ratios will be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "an even more stringent test of the new @xmath0 production process is the measurement of the @xmath0 production cross section or total multiplicity ( and not the ratio ) in the presented heavy ion experiments , which has been published for the ar+kcl collisions by the hades collaboration to be @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we obtain a total @xmath0 yield of @xmath79 which is in very good agreement with the hades data .    as already mentioned the ratio of @xmath70 not only depends on the production probabilities of the mesons but also on the absorption probability in the dense matter . the inelastic cross section for @xmath80 ( absorption ) implemented in urqmd",

    "it follows from the measured ( a fit to hera data @xcite ) strangeness exchange processes and resonance excitations .",
    "we find that the urqmd @xmath63 absorption cross section on protons is mainly consistent with the available data , while at very low relative momenta the inelastic @xmath80 cross section is smaller than what has been measured",

    "an important aspect of @xmath0 production in nuclear collisions is the possibility of medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson . a particularly interesting observable in this context",

    "the explanation of the strong suppression of the @xmath0 meson production in our approach can not be a large inelastic @xmath82 cross section ( which is of the order of @xmath88 mb while the elastic cross section is set to 5 mb ) . because the @xmath0 is hardly absorbed ( in our model ) in the nuclear medium it is in fact the heavy mother resonance of the @xmath0 which rescatters with another nucleon before it can decay into @xmath89 . during this inelastic",

    "<S> we present a possible explanation for the deep sub - threshold , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production yields measured with the hades experiment in ar+kcl reactions at @xmath2 a gev and present predictions for au+au reactions at @xmath3 a gev . </S>",
    "<S> to explain the surprisingly high yields of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadrons we propose new decay channels for high mass baryon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> these new decay channels are constrained by elementary @xmath4 cross sections , and @xmath1 production in p+nb . </S>",
    "<S> based on the fits to the elementary reactions one obtains a satisfactorily description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in deep sub - threshold ar+kcl reactions as well as the observed nuclear transparency ratio in proton induced @xmath0 production in cold nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the results implicate that no new medium effects are required to describe the rare strange particle production data in low energy nuclear collisions . </S>"
