    "the red colors can be caused by evolved stellar populations , dust , or a combination of both .",
    "it is difficult to assess the origin of the red colors from optical - to - nir photometry alone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the extension of photometric studies to the rest - frame nir wavelength regime helps : using irac on @xmath7 , @xcite distinguish the old from the dusty system much more reliably than was previously possible , and find that a significant part ( 30% ) of the drg sample is indeed best described by old and passively evolving stellar population models .",
    "this result is supported by the @xmath7 24 @xmath8 m imaging presented by @xcite , who find that 65% of the drgs host dusty star - forming stellar populations .",
    "similar findings have also been reported by @xcite and @xcite based on optical to mid - infrared photometry of the goods - south and north fields    although our insight in the nature of @xmath1 galaxies has significantly improved by the recent access to the rest - frame nir and ir wavelength regime , broadband photometric studies have their limitations .",
    "first , as spectral details get lost , the origin of the observed emission is uncertain .",
    "emission lines may affect the broadband fluxes , and a possible contribution by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is difficult to quantify .",
    "second , the modeling results suffer from degeneracies between age , dust and the star formation history , especially when no spectroscopic redshift is available .    the large samples of confirmed high - redshift galaxies available today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) give the impression that obtaining spectroscopic redshifts is relatively easy .",
    "the most efficient and popular technique in obtaining redshifts for large samples of high redshift galaxies is multi - object spectroscopy at optical wavelengths .",
    "however , as about 75% of @xmath9 galaxies with @xmath10 have @xmath11 @xcite , most are well beyond the limits of optical spectroscopy .",
    "thus nir spectroscopy is needed to obtain redshifts for these uv - faint galaxies .    for uv - faint passively evolving galaxies , which lack emission lines in their rest - frame optical",
    ", we are limited to the rest - frame optical stellar continuum to measure a redshift .",
    "the most easily detectable feature in the spectrum of evolved stars , and thus the best option to confirm redshifts of @xmath1 evolved galaxies , is the balmer/4000 break .",
    "the break is also a powerful diagnostic in stellar population studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for galaxies beyond @xmath12 the break shifts into the nir , where the combination of high sky background and strong atmospheric absorption bands complicates continuum studies of galaxies .",
    "recently new nir spectrographs on 8 - 10 meter class telescopes have improved our access to the nir regime significantly .",
    "this is demonstrated by the first possible detections of rest - frame optical breaks by @xcite and @xcite with keck / nirspec and subaru / cisco respectively .",

    "we observed the galaxies following an aba@xmath29b@xmath29 on - source dither pattern . in this way we can use the average of the previous and successive exposures as the sky frame .",

    "compared to the standard abba pattern , this method decreases the noise by about 13% in the sky - subtracted frames .",
    "we complemented the gnirs spectra with the spectrum of ms1054 - 1319 obtained with nirspec on keck @xcite .",
    "we observed ms1054 - 1319 during two runs using the n4 filter and medium dispersion mode ( 1.23 - 1.55 @xmath8 m , r=1600 ) , which is especially useful to target the region around the optical break for @xmath30 galaxies . the first run in january 2003 was characterized by cloudy weather and a typical seeing of 09 in @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the conditions during the second run in february 2004 were somewhat better with a seeing of 08 . to extend the wavelength coverage for this galaxy , we complement the n4 coverage by @xmath23 and @xmath18 band spectra obtained with nirspec on keck and isaac on the vlt .",
    "for details on these observations see table  [ obs ] .",
    "the nirspec and isaac spectra were taken at three dither positions ( abc ) , as the slit length of both instruments is longer than for gnirs .",
    "similar to the aba@xmath29b@xmath29 pattern we can use the average of the previous and following exposures as sky frame .",
    "all targets were acquired by blind offsets from nearby stars . with nirspec",
    "the alignment was checked and corrected if needed before every individual 900s exposure .",
    "furthermore , at each dither position a separate spectrum was taken of the offset star to determine the expected position of the object spectrum on the detector . as gnirs and isaac",
    "have better pointing stability there was no need for re - acquisition after each individual exposure , and acquisition checks were performed approximately every hour .",
    "the total exposure times of all objects and modes are listed in table  [ obs ] .    after each observing sequence , we observed an av0 star near the target .",
    "these spectra are used in the reduction to correct for detector response and atmospheric absorption .",
    "we note that other targets were also observed during these runs .",
    "however , the galaxies discussed here are the only ones for which we specifically attempted to measure the continuum rather than just emission lines .",
    "the reduction of the nirspec spectra of ms1054 - 1319 is described by @xcite .",
    "the isaac spectra of ms1054 - 1319 were reduced in a similar way as the nirspec spectra . for the gnirs data reduction of cdfs-695 and hdfs-5710",
    "we developed a suite of custom scripts to perform the following steps .",
    "we started the reduction by removing a bias pattern .",
    "the pattern repeats itself every 8 columns , differently in each quadrant .",
    "it was modeled by fitting a constant along the vertical direction in regions where no spectrum is present , and removed over the whole detector .",
    "we also corrected for persistence from the acquisition image on the detector .",
    "cosmic rays were removed as follows .",
    "first , we removed the sky from the science frames by subtracting the average of the previous and next exposure .",
    "for additional sky - subtraction we have to straighten the orders , which follow curved paths on the detector .",
    "we determined the position of the object spectrum in each row of each order by tracing the spectrum of a bright star .",
    "next , we straightened the orders by integer pixel shifts ( to retain the cosmic ray shapes ) , using the expected object positions .",
    "because of the small slit length , there is not enough ` empty ' sky left to remove the remaining sky by fitting lines along the spatial direction .",
    "however , the negative object spectrum should cancel its positive counterpart , and any residual sky was removed by requiring that the biweight mean @xcite along the spatial direction is zero at every wavelength .",
    "next , we run l.a.cosmic @xcite on the sky - free frames to identify the cosmic rays .",
    "the resulting cosmic ray masks were convolved by a boxcar to exclude neighboring pixels .",
    "the masks of the different orders were transformed back to the original shape of the spectrum without interpolation and combined to one cosmic ray mask for each individual exposure . throughout the following description",
    ", the cosmic ray mask will be transformed in the same way as the science frames .",
    "we continued with the original raw frames and performed the same steps as described above to remove the sky , only this time we allowed interpolation when straightening the orders . for each exposure and each order ,",
    "a 1d noise frame was made from the subtracted sky .",
    "this noise frame was used to identify dead and hot pixels , which were added to the mask .",
    "next , the orders of each frame were wavelength calibrated using arc lamp frames .",
    "the calibrations were checked and if necessary corrected using skylines .",
    "corrections for the instrumental response function and atmospheric absorption were applied by dividing by the response spectrum .",
    "this spectrum was created from the observed spectrum of an av0 star , which was divided by the spectrum of vega .",
    "residuals from balmer absorption features in the spectrum of the av0 star were removed by interpolation .",
    "the spectrum of the av0 star was reduced in the same way as the science frames .",
    "the different exposures were combined for each order , excluding cosmic rays and outliers as identified in the masks .",
    "finally the orders were combined , properly weighting overlapping regions using the response function . in the entire procedure pixels",
    "were interpolated only once , to minimize smoothing and noise correlations in the final frames .",
    "for all three galaxies the 1d spectrum was extracted by summing all lines ( along the wavelength direction ) with a mean flux @xmath31 0.25 @xmath32 the flux in the central row , using optimal weighting . in addition , a ` low - resolution ' ( binned ) spectrum was extracted as follows .",
    "the pixels were sampled along the wavelength direction in each line of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectrum using the biweight estimator .",
    "thus we created a binned spectrum for each line of the 2d spectrum .",
    "hereafter the lines with a mean flux @xmath31 0.25 @xmath32 the flux in the central line were added corresponding to their weighting factors .",
    "this procedure gives a higher s / n in the final low resolution spectrum than binning the original extracted 1d spectrum .",
    "regions with low or variable atmospheric transmission or with strong sky line emission were excluded . for cdfs-695 and",
    "hdfs-5710 observed with gnirs , we defined these regions as those with less than 5% of the maximum transmission and with sky line intensities of 30% or more of the strongest line . for ms1054 - 1319",
    "observed with nirspec and isaac , these criteria were @xmath3330% and @xmath3125% , respectively . for ms1054 - 1319",
    "the spectra were sampled in 30 pixel bins ( @xmath3480  ) , and the other two galaxies were sampled in bins of 50 pixels ( @xmath34250  ) . rather than to vary the number of pixels that contribute to each wavelength bin ( i.e. excluding bad wavelength regions ) , the width was adjusted such that each bin contains 30 or 50 ` good ' pixels .    for ms1054 - 1319",
    "we combined the nirspec and isaac spectra of different but overlapping wavelength coverages . adding 2d spectra",
    "would have decreased the s / n as there is a difference in seeing and sampling of instruments .",
    "instead we combined the different spectra in the following way .",
    "first , we extracted a low resolution spectrum for each individual 2d spectrum , by using the same bins and a common mask for excluding regions of poor atmospheric transmission or with strong sky lines .",
    "these spectra were scaled by minimizing @xmath35 in the overlapping regions and thereafter combined .",
    "these scaling factors were used to combine the ` high resolution ' 1d spectra as well .",
    "spectra of different wavelength coverages without overlapping regions were scaled using the total broadband @xmath23 and @xmath18 magnitudes . to scale the spectra , we modeled the continuum by fitting a straight line to the low resolution spectrum , excluding bins that may contain emission lines .",
    "the modeled continuum was converted to @xmath36 and thereafter convolved with the appropriate filter - curve and normalized using the emission line corrected total fluxes .",
    "the gnirs spectra of hdfs-5710 and cdfs-695 were scaled in the same way , but as the wavelength coverage is not divided over different bands , we used an error - weighted average scale factor obtained from the broadband @xmath23 and @xmath18 magnitudes to tie the spectrum to the broad band photometry . in this procedure , we did not use the broadband @xmath22 magnitude because the balmer/4000   break complicates the modeling of the continuum in this band .",
    "the 1d original and low resolution spectra are presented in fig .",

    "we only show the area around the break observed with nirspec , which has continuous coverage . for each galaxy",
    "an optical break is detected .",

    "there are even indications that some individual absorption features are detected for ms1054 - 1319 ( h@xmath37 and ca(h ) ) and cdfs-695 ( ca and h@xmath38 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectra of cdfs-695 and hdfs-5710 , observed with gnirs , decreases in the blue , which is reflected in the error bars in fig .",
    "the outliers bluewards of the break in cdfs-695 are caused by residual bias patterns which can not be properly removed .    in the spectrum of cdfs-695",

    "even ms1054 - 1319 , for which the properties are already well - constrained by the photometry , the spectrum decreases the 1@xmath80 confidence interval of age and @xmath77 by a factor 7 - 8 . and",
    "finally , for hdfs-5710 the largest gain is achieved by the better constrained redshift . also",
    ", solutions with @xmath77 longer than 700 myr are ruled out by the spectrum .",
    "the normalized @xmath35 values per degree of freedom for the fits to the broadband photometry are lower than those for the fits including the nir spectroscopy . however , the difference between the @xmath35 of the best fit and the 1@xmath80 and 2@xmath80 confidence intervals are smaller for fits including the nir spectra ( see table  [ mod ] ) , which result in the tighter constraints .",
    "one possible cause for the difference in minimal @xmath35 of the best photometric and spectral fits is that @xmath35 statistics are very sensitive to the data uncertainties .",
    "the photometric errors may be overestimated or the spectral errors may be underestimated .",
    "another cause could be template mismatch , which can become more problematic with more detailed spectroscopic information .    to test the robustness of our results we repeated the fitting procedure for ms1054 - 1319 , artificially decreasing the errors on the photometry by a factor of 2 and increasing the errors on the spectra by a factor of 2 .",
    "the allowed ranges for @xmath81 , age and @xmath77 are slightly increased and reduced for the spectra and photometry respectively , but even in this extreme case inclusion of the spectra still improves the constraints on the stellar populations .",
    "our fitting results show that including the nir spectra when fitting the broadband fluxes sets tighter constraints on stellar population properties and reduces degeneracies between age , extinction and the sfh .",
    "this is mainly due to the measurement of the shape and strength of the optical break .",
    "we conclude that the spectral shape in combination with the photometry is more powerful than the broadband photometry alone in tracing the properties of stellar populations in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the drgs studied here span a wide range in their derived properties , consistent with results of larger samples based on modeling of their broadband seds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their sfh , reddening and age are quite different , ranging from cdfs-695 which is about 0.2 gyr old and is forming a few hundred solar masses a year , to hdfs-5710 and ms1054 - 1319 which are both best fitted by a stellar population of 1.4 gyr old and are forming a few tens of solar masses a year .",
    "@xcite divided their drg sample into dusty starburst and `` red and dead '' galaxies based on the observed nir and ir colors ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "to compare the drgs presented in this work with those of @xcite , we measured the same colors by extrapolating the best spectral fit to the rest - frame nir .",
    "all three galaxies fall in the dusty star - forming part of the plot , although their locations move closer towards the `` red and dead '' part , when going from cdfs-695 to ms1054 - 1319 to hdfs-5710 .",
    "in the previous section we studied the spectra by comparing them to models .",
    "the break appeared to be the driving feature behind the improved modeling constraints . in this section , we take a different approach by measuring the break directly , and use this feature in combination with h@xmath3  to constrain the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "the balmer and 4000   break are often treated as one feature , owing to their similar locations and the fact that they partially overlap .",
    "however , the breaks originate from different physical processes , and behave differently as populations age .",
    "both breaks are due to absorption in the atmosphere of stars .",
    "the 4000  break arises because of an accumulation of absorption lines of mainly ionized metals .",
    "as the opacity increases with decreasing stellar temperature , the 4000   break gets larger with older ages , and is largest for old and metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "the metallicity is of minor influence for ages less than 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "there are several definitions introduced to quantify the strength of the 4000   break .",
    "@xcite proposed @xmath91 , which measures the ratio of the average flux density @xmath36 in the bands 4050 - 4250   and 3750 - 3950   around the break . because of the broad regions , this index is fairly sensitive to reddening by dust . to reduce this effect , @xcite defined a new index @xmath92 , based on smaller continuum regions ( 3850 - 3950  , 4000 - 4100  ) .",
    "the balmer break at 3646  marks the termination of the hydrogen balmer series , and is strongest in a - type stars",
    ". therefore the break strength does not monotonically increase with age but reaches a maximum in stellar populations of intermediate ages ( 0.3 - 1 gyr ) .",
    "the strength of the balmer sequence can be best measured from the individual balmer lines , such as h@xmath38 . however , as our spectra do not allow the measurement of this feature , we use the strength of the balmer break ( @xmath93 ) , which we define as the ratio of the average flux density @xmath36 in the bands 3500 - 3650   and 3800 - 3950   around the break .",
    "the large regions are not optimal , but are a trade - off between dust - dependence and having sufficient s / n using the spectra of high redshift galaxies .",
    "this index is also partially influenced by the 4000   break .",
    "nevertheless , the age - dependence of @xmath93 is very similar to that of h@xmath38 .",
    "we determined @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the three drgs .",
    "the average flux in the regions around the breaks is measured in the same way as we extracted the binned spectra . for",
    "ms1054 - 1319 it was impossible to measure the flux redwards of the 4000   break , as the defined region is entirely covered by an atmospheric band .",
    "therefore we measured @xmath91 and used the @xcite models to derive @xmath92 for this galaxy . when converting the indices we allowed an @xmath81  between 0 and 3 and all three star formation histories to determine the uncertainty .",
    "we note that this only slightly increases the uncertainty as for the measured break strength of ms1054 - 1319 the correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is not very dependent on dust or the star formation history .",
    "the break measurements are listed in table  [ diag ] and shown in fig .",

    "this figure is useful for discriminating between different star formation histories , as it provides a clear illustration that ( near-)constant star formation models are not able to produce a large break within 3 gyr .",
    "however , if a galaxy is extremely dusty , reddening can mimic a very large break .",

    "<S> we use near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini , nirspec on keck , and isaac on the vlt to study the rest - frame optical continua of three ` distant red galaxies ' ( having @xmath0 ) at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> all three galaxy spectra show the balmer/4000   break in the rest - frame optical . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum with an estimated accuracy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these redshifts agree well with the emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with h@xmath3  emission . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in the rest - frame uv , as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selected in optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we use the break , continuum shape , and equivalent width of h@xmath3  together with evolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age , star formation timescale , dust content , stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range of possible solutions for stellar population properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stellar populations differ greatly among the three galaxies , ranging from a young dusty starburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxy with a strong break and no detected line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the dusty starburst galaxy has an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1 @xmath4  m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the two most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3 - 1.4 gyr and stellar masses of 4@xmath4  m@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the large breaks for the two most evolved galaxies indicate that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) do not dominate the rest - frame optical continuum emission of these galaxies , while for the younger starburst a significant contribution from an agn can not be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthens our previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry . </S>",
    "<S> larger samples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starbursts and ( nearly ) passively evolving galaxies at @xmath6 . </S>"
