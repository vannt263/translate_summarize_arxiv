    "it is by now well - established that there is a strong stellar bar in the inner disk of the milky way .",
    "a central bar was first hypothesized by @xcite , although the observational evidence has only become overwhelming during the past decade ( e.g. , kuijken 1996 ) . near and far - infrared source count maps",
    "have led numerous authors to identify a triaxial bar roughly 35 kpc long , with its near side in the first quadrant of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ogle survey extended these maps of the inner galaxy to optical wavelengths and also found the bar morphology @xcite .",
    "recent work based on 2mass data @xcite shows the full bar quite clearly .",
    "dynamical arguments suggest that bars in galaxies may be triggered by satellites and companions , intrinsic halo asymmetry , or as a result of disk instability .",
    "once formed , bars may be important for driving the evolution of galaxies through global angular momentum redistribution and increased rates of gas transport to galaxy centers . as a result",
    ", barredness may affect a galaxy s star - formation history and nuclear activity .",
    "the dynamics of bars together with knowledge of bar ages may be crucial to understanding disk - halo interactions and merger histories . despite the wealth of data on bar morphologies , little",
    "is known of their ages , except for the statistical result that bar frequency appears to decline with redshift for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if the stellar populations of the milky way bar can be age - dated , then the approximate time of the triggering event can be established .",
    "this is a first step towards reconstructing the dynamical history of disk asymmetries in the galaxy .",
    "we know that infrared carbon ( ir  c ) stars reliably map out the milky way bar ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) . in  2",
    ", we briefly recapitulate the selection criteria for ir  c  stars that allow us to identify this population and to invert its magnitude distribution into a distance distribution . ",
    "3 describes the arguments for an intermediate age for the ir  c  stars .",
    "we argue that they are certainly younger than 6  gyr , and probably younger than 3  gyr , and therefore the bar must have formed more recently than these limits . in  4 , we discuss the implications of this result for studies of bar formation and suggest further work to refine our conclusion . in short ,",
    "if the milky way is typical , bars might be temporary features that can be successively re - excited during a galaxy s lifetime .",
    "carbon stars come in several flavors , differing in their colors and luminosities , evolutionary states , kinematics , and surface enrichment patterns .",
    "the brightest ( @xmath04 @xmath4 m@xmath5 @xmath4 @xmath06 ) , and reddest ( j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath6 1.2 ) c  stars are the classical n - type agb stars ; they are typified by irc  @xmath710216 ( cw  leo ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "the term `` c  star '' will be used to refer to these cool , luminous agb stars only ; the term `` ir  c  star '' will be used to refer to the subset of c  stars redder than ( j@xmath0k@xmath1)@xmath8 = 2 .",
    "the ir  c  stars may be identified , with care , in the 2mass ( j@xmath0k@xmath1 , k@xmath1 ) cmd @xcite .",
    "to illustrate , figure  1a shows the hess diagram of a 4 deg@xmath9 region of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "a detailed exploration of the 2mass view of the lmc has been made by @xcite , so we will only touch on the most prominent features here .",
    "the main ridgeline of stars extending up to k@xmath1  @xmath10 11 is the red giant and asymptotic giant ( agb ) sequence of the intermediate - age and old stellar population .",
    "the brighter plume reaching k@xmath1@xmath10 8 consists of red supergiants .",
    "the c  stars occupy a bilinear sequence redward of j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath10 1.4 , with a slope change at j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath10 2 .",
    "the redder sources are intrinsically similar to the warmer stars , but are enveloped in a thick shroud of dust .",
    "thus the extended c  star sequence lies nearly parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "the ir  c  star  branch of the 2mass cmd of the milky way is shown in figure  1b .",
    "the figure includes roughly 3 @xmath1110@xmath12 sources drawn from the entire sky excluding the magellanic clouds .",
    "the color - magnitude distribution is wider than that in figure  1a because of the large distance spread within the galaxy and the high number of deeply embedded sources in the larger galactic sample .",
    "an additional dispersion due to contamination by oh / ir stars must be present ; these have similar luminosities and near - ir colors to the ir  c  stars @xcite .",
    "spectra of stars in this region of the cmd have been obtained in the lmc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the outer galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the inner galaxy ( m. skrutskie , private communication ) . a high fraction of the measured stars have c - type spectra , with significant contamination by highly reddened ( e(b@xmath0v ) @xmath13 ) m  supergiants and oh / ir stars .",
    "we thus expect that a high fraction of the total number of color - selected sources are carbon - rich too .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes have shown @xmath14m@xmath15@xmath16 = @xmath07.6 @xmath17 1 for carbon - rich mira and sra variables @xcite .",
    "the lmc population has @xmath14k@xmath1@xmath16 = 10.8 and @xmath18 = @xmath170.6 , which yields @xmath14m@xmath15@xmath16 = @xmath07.7 for an assumed distance modulus of 18.5 mag .",
    "we are therefore confident that the galactic sample is similar to the lmc ir  c  stars .",
    "figure  1 shows that the k@xmath1  magnitude of the ir  c  stars , with an appropriate color correction , is stable enough to allow rough calculations of galactic structure .",
    "a least - squares fit to the ir  c  star  branch of the lmc yields a linear relation , @xmath19k@xmath1  = @xmath00.48  ( j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath0 2 ) . application of this shift to the individual k@xmath1  magnitudes reduces all ir  c  stars to a common basis from which their approximate line of sight distances can be derived .",
    "the result is shown in figure  2 , which shows the symmetric disk plus central bar morphology of the galaxy .",
    "our simple inversion distorts the image , although the bar signature is unambiguous .",
    "the width of the m@xmath15   distribution , due to pulsational variations and age / metallicity differences , stretches and twists the bar in figure  2 .",
    "we systematically account for these biases by using a bayesian parameter estimation for an exponential disk with a quadrupole bar . restricting the sample to @xmath20to minimize confusion error , and correcting for extinction @xcite",
    ", we find the most likely disk parameters to be : a scale length @xmath21 kpc , a bar radius of @xmath22 kpc , a position angle @xmath23 , and a relative bar strength of @xmath24 .",
    "the method and results will be further described in a later paper .",
    "the position angle and shape of the inferred bar are hatched in figure  2 .",
    "density cuts through the data along lines parallel and perpendicular to the sun - galactic center line are shown for comparison to the exponential scale length in figure  3 .",
    "the low sensitivity of ir colors to reddening ensures that the ir  c  star  sequence is relatively free from contamination for colors redder than j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath10 2.5 .",
    "even if large differential reddening is present , its effect should be small because the ir  c  star  sequence runs virtually parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "the striking symmetry of our inferred galactic disk shows that selection effects are not driving our result .",
    "whether a thermally pulsing agb star becomes a c  star depends on its initial mass and metallicity .",
    "theoretical calibration of the minimum mass ( and hence maximum age ) necessary for c",
    "star formation is uncertain due to the poorly understood physics of the dredge - up process @xcite . empirical determination of the age range for c  star formation has been hampered by the lack of massive ( @xmath25 m@xmath26 ) intermediate - age star clusters in the galaxy , and the age gap in large magellanic cloud clusters between 3 and 9 gyr @xcite .",
    "synthetic models put the lower mass limit for c  star production at 1.13 m@xmath26 for z = 0.004 , and 1.32 m@xmath26 for z = 0.008 ; these masses correspond to ages of 5.2 and 3.9 gyr , respectively @xcite .",
    "empirical evidence confirms the theoretical prediction for a diminishing probability of c  star formation with increasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the scale height of field c  stars to be similar to that of main - sequence f  stars , which have ages of roughly 13  gyr .",
    "star cluster ages are more easily measured ; figure  4 shows a sample of clusters in the milky way and the magellanic clouds whose c  star content is known .",
    "the clusters are sorted by age and m@xmath27 .",
    "solid and open symbols differentiate between clusters with and without ir  c  stars . for clusters with c  stars ,",
    "the approximate number is given in parentheses , with the total c  star population before the slash and the ir  c  star  population , where present , after .",
    "c  star content is taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the open and magellanic clusters .",
    "globular clusters do not contain c  stars @xcite .",
    "while many clusters aged younger than 2  gyr containing ir  c  stars have been omitted from figure  4 , we are unaware of _ any _ clusters older than 3.2  gyr containing or suspected of containing them .",
    "the oldest cluster in the galaxy thought to contain an ir  c  star  is trumpler  5 @xcite .",
    "trumpler  5 is aged 2.8 gyr , and membership of the ir  c  star , v493  mon , is not confirmed due to the lack of proper motion studies of the cluster .",
    "ngc  2121 , an lmc cluster aged 3.2  gyr , is the oldest cluster known to harbor an ir  c  star .",
    "metal - poor smc clusters as old as 57 gyr contain luminous c  stars , but none as red as j@xmath0k@xmath1  = 2 .",
    "the efficiency of c  star production dramatically drops with age among bright clusters : compare the c  star content of ngc  419 ( 1.6  gyr , 9 c  stars ) with ngc  416 ( 6.9  gyr , 1 c  star ) , and the globular cluster ngc  362 ( 12  gyr , no c  stars )",
    ".    perhaps ir  c  stars are born , but with reduced efficiency , at ages larger than 3  gyr ; the lack of bright clusters aged 35  gyr makes it difficult to tell",
    ". a stricter limit may be imposed by the lack of ir  c  stars in m32 .",
    "m32 is known to harbor a significant intermediate - age stellar population @xcite ; @xcite derive 35 gyr and z @xmath10 z@xmath26 .",
    "however , @xcite find that its jhk colors are dominated by early k  giants , and @xcite reports that m32 s agb terminates blueward of j@xmath0k = 1.5 .",
    "because of the high luminosity of m32 ( m@xmath27 = @xmath016.7 ) compared to a star cluster , its blue agb may be the strongest observational evidence for a cutoff in c  star production at approximately 3 gyr for populations of roughly solar metallicity .    in summary ,",
    "all empirical age estimates for ir  c  stars indicate ages less than about 3 gyr .",
    "this agrees with theoretical expectations for a shutdown of the c  star formation mechanism between 45 gyr for stars of magellanic cloud metallicity , and possibly younger ages for higher metallicities .",
    "the oldest known c  stars are roughly 6  gyr old , but the metallicity dependence of c  star formation and the lack of very red agb stars in m32 makes ages of 13  gyr much more probable .",
    "we have used 2mass data to trace the structure of the galactic disk and bar using the @xcite sample of ir  c  stars with ( j@xmath0k@xmath1 ) @xmath4 2 .",
    "the epoch of strong star formation along galactic bars is expected to be brief ( @xmath281  gyr * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to occur during their formation .",
    "little or no star formation is expected to occur within the bar once it has become well - established , and stars that subsequently form in the disk can not themselves join the bar .",
    "some support for this view comes from the observation that h ii regions are common in the bars only of late - type , active , or morphologically disturbed galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the progenitors of the ir  c  stars were born prior to or during the formation of the bar , and hence their lifetimes give an upper limit to the bar age .",
    "the oldest attested c  stars ( in smc clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath29 ) are 57  gyr old .",
    "if all the c  stars in the galactic bar were similar to the metal - poor smc stars , reddened into our color window , the bar could thus be as old as roughly 6  gyr . among the oldest star clusters with ir  c  stars",
    "are ngc  2121 ( lmc , 3.2  gyr ) , and _ possibly _ tr  5 ( milky way , 2.8  gyr ) .",
    "m32 appears not to contain ir  c  stars @xcite , and contains a large stellar population aged 35 gyr @xcite .",
    "we thus find it highly probable that the milky way bar is younger than 3  gyr .",
    "this time frame is intriguing , given the reports of a declining bar frequency among galaxies with redshifts @xmath3 @xcite , corresponding to lookback times of 56  gyr .",
    "few age estimates have been made for the milky way bar .",
    "@xcite ascribed an 89  gyr stellar population in baade s window to the bar , but the population s spatial distribution is not known , making the bar identification tentative . @xcite",
    "inferred an age of 7.5  gyr from oh / ir stars with m @xmath10 1.3  m@xmath26 ; updated theoretical models @xcite give 4.7  gyr for this mass .",
    "the main - sequence turnoff of a 3  gyr - old population should be readily traceable along the galactic bar from v @xmath1017 at the near end to v @xmath1019 at the far end ( modulo reddening differences ) .",
    "could the ir  c  stars be a trace population that wandered into the bar by chance ? the lmc has m@xmath30",
    "@xmath10 10@xmath31 m@xmath26 , and contains 2100 ir  c  stars . @xcite give m@xmath32 @xmath10 2 @xmath11 10@xmath31 m@xmath26 , and we find 5300 sources with j@xmath0k@xmath1  @xmath4 2 inside the bar radius . for reasonable rates of contamination by oh / ir stars , the bar seems to have an ir  c  starspecific frequency comparable to the lmc s , arguing against the idea that 2mass is seeing a trace young population within a much older bar .",
    "2mass observations of the lmc show that our color cut excludes roughly 75% of the n - type c  stars @xcite . if more of the c  stars could be traced ,",
    "an accurate estimate of the fraction of intermediate - age stars in the bar could be made @xcite .",
    "could the ir  c  stars be older than roughly 3  gyr ?",
    "membership studies for tr  5 and other potential c  star - bearing open clusters would help to empirically set the upper age limit for c  star formation .",
    "further study of m32 s agb , to definitively measure its red extent , could push the likely age of the bar upwards , if its j@xmath0k@xmath1  reaches @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "bar dust lanes can have high molecular gas content , yet low star - formation rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even in galaxies undergoing transient bursts ( e.g. , ngc  7479 ) ,",
    "the intensity of star formation along the bars is generally suppressed relative to that of the disk @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a bar contains a snapshot of the disk stellar population at the time of its formation .",
    "however , barred galaxies typically have enhanced star formation at the ends of their bars and in their nuclei .",
    "could these young stars join the bar as they form ?",
    "a star can only be trapped in the bar by losing angular momentum as its orbit passes through a resonance .",
    "this can only happen efficiently if the bar is actively evolving .",
    "the existence of a well - described molecular ring in the galaxy , presumably near corotation , suggests that our bar has a stable pattern speed , and therefore is not rapidly swallowing its own ends .",
    "bars are ubiquitous in numerical simulations ; detailed studies by many authors show that the quasistatic gas response agrees well with observed morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this morphological coincidence suggests that the bars are at least several rotation times ( @xmath341  gyr ) old , and that their pattern speeds are not rapidly evolving . on the other hand ,",
    "a concentrated dark matter halo can cause a bar to lose angular momentum through dynamical friction . @xcite",
    "have argued that bars such as the milky way s are strongly braked by this effect , which would imply rapid bar evolution .",
    "however , @xcite have hypothesized that a primordial bar that forms during the epoch of disk assembly will torque up the inner halo as it is braked , producing a core in the halo density distribution .",
    "this initial , transient bar paves the way for a long - lived , stellar bar , since the altered halo mass profile does not slow bars as efficiently .",
    "the genesis of the current milky way bar remains to be explained .",
    "tidal triggering by the lmc , the sagittarius dwarf , or a now - merged satellite is a plausible origin @xcite .",
