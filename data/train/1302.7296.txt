    "causality imposes constraints on systems that are strongly out of equilibrium by restricting the rate of change of correlation lengths to the relevant causal speed ( such as the speed of sound ) .",
    "this is particularly the case in the vicinity of symmetry - breaking continuous transitions where , adiabatically , correlation lengths become arbitrarily large .",
    "since such transitions take place in finite time , correlation lengths must remain finite .",

    "the correlation length @xmath28 that sets the scale for phase change along the ring is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are system - dependent and @xmath32 is the quench time ( the inverse quench rate through the transition ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath33 can be derived from critical exponents valid for the adiabatic transition and the out - of - equilibrium behaviour is thereby categorised by the equilibrium universality class of the system . for type - ii superconductors @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the mean - field approximation .",
    "there is a somewhat different viewpoint , predicated on the approximate gaussianity of fast quenches , explored several years ago by one of us ( rr ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , preliminary simulations which further support underlying gaussian behaviour were performed by us @xcite and this paper continues this analysis in two ways .",
    "firstly , we extend both the numerical simulations and the analytical approximations to see more closely the validity of simple gaussian assumptions .",
    "secondly we present new experimental data on the presence of fluxoid production in the presence of an external field , which go beyond the reach of the kz scenario , but for which gaussian assumptions give predictions .",
    "our starting point is the observation that we would get the same scaling behaviour ( [ xibar ] ) if we evaluated @xmath36 at @xmath37 and , indeed , it has been proposed that @xmath37 is as relevant a time as @xmath38 @xcite , but we know for other reasons that it is what happens after the transition is implemented that determines the relevant distance scales @xcite .",
    "this suggests defect formation as due to the growth of unstable long wavelength modes as the field is rolling off the hill which now denotes the unstable symmetry preserving vacuum , rather than through direct causal bounds .",
    "if , nonetheless , we take the kz scenario as a guide for the time @xmath38 at which defects form , then @xmath38 is much smaller than the time it takes for the order parameter field(s ) to experience the degenerate vacua .",
    "if they remain so close to the unstable vacuum that the non - linearities of the backreaction can be approximately ignored then the effectively linearised field equations give rise to gaussian field correlation functions . generally , these lead to the identical scaling behaviour ( 1 ) for fast quenches for large systems , both non - relativistic and relativistic @xcite . in practice , whatever the difference in language , our viewpoint is not very dissimilar from the kz picture , in that both our simulations and the many simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) demonstrating the validity of the scaling behaviour ( [ xibar ] ) are based on _ time - dependent _ ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory .",
    "it is these equations that we linearise to derive the gaussian results .",
    "having said that , there are two issues which force us to step outside the kz picture and it is here that the greater generality of our approach is crucial .",
    "the first is that , whereas the early universe can be taken as homogeneous to a very high degree , the same can not be said about laboratory systems .",
    "one step to limit inhomogeneity is to make the systems small .",

    "the gaussian approximation permits an analytic replacement to ( [ per0 ] ) and ( [ xibar ] ) for _ homogeneous _ small systems for which @xmath40 which is inaccessible to the kz picture .",
    "thus , what seems to be a problem is , in fact , an opportunity .",
    "we can use small annuli to cast the kz scenario in a different light and illuminate the gaussian approximation .",
    "secondly , the gaussian approximation has a further reach , to explicit symmetry breaking driven by the application of external fields , for which the kz scenario again offers little help .",
    "this is an interesting problem in its own right and experimentally is a serious problem because of the presence of stray fields in the laboratory . scaling behaviour ( [ xibar ] ) can only be demonstrated once external fields have been countered upon which , again , the gaussian approximation gives insight .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . for narrow rings",
    "we might hope that the system behaves one - dimensionally . in the next section",
    "we reexamine the gaussian approximation ( or rather , two closely related gaussian approximations ) both for large and small idealised 1d systems .",
    "we shall show later that numerical simulations provide strong support for gaussian behaviour , both in the power spectrum of field ordering and in the damping of fluxoid generation in small systems , an exercise begun in @xcite and developed considerably here .",
    "in particular , we explore the way the power of field fluctuations is driven into long wavelengths through the growth of unstable modes , in good accord with our gaussian expectations .    in the subsequent sections we briefly summarise earlier work of ours @xcite in which we simulated a 2d superconducting annulus embedded in 3d space , with a fully dynamical electromagnetic field in three dimensions .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for further details .",
    "surprisingly , we found that our results are , in key ways , indistinguishable from those of the 1d simulation and thereby , of the gaussian approximation .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of new experimental results for fluxoid production in an external field and show that it too , is explicable in terms of gaussian fluctuations . as we said earlier ,",
    "the experimental details are given in the appendix .",
    "unsurprisingly , 1d systems are the easiest for which to make analytic predictions and to implement numerical simulations . there are two strongly related variants of gaussian approximation that we shall consider ; each has its strengths .      our first gaussian approximation , first proposed in @xcite , has the advantage of being much simpler analytically , predicated on the perimeter rule ( [ per0 ] ) .",

    "the doubling of kz scaling exponents for fluxon production in annular josephson tunnel junctions is the most complicated of all . on the one hand , it can be understood as due to the fabrication of the junction , a proximity effect arising from the ( a priori undetermined ) deposition of non - superconducting metal on the oxide interface .",
