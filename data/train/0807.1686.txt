    "age is , arguably , the most difficult basic stellar quantity to estimate for low - mass field dwarfs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "yet , the temporal evolution of phenomena such as stellar activity , surface abundances , rotation , and circumstellar matter is of current interest and within observational means for nearby stars .",

    "field stars , however , are generally main sequence objects and , by definition , lack co - eval accompanying stellar populations that might enable accurate age dating via standard h - r diagram techniques . thus proxy indicators of age are necessary .      historically , a popular age estimator for field stars of roughly solar mass has been the @xmath1 index which measures chromospheric emission in the cores of the broad photospheric ca ii h & k absorption lines , normalized to the underlying photospheric spectrum .",
    "chromospheric activity is generated through the stellar magnetic dynamo , the strength of which appears to scale with rotation velocity @xcite . both chromospheric emission and rotation are observationally constrained to decay with age @xcite .",

    "we conclude the following regarding adopting a simple activity - age relation (  [ relation ] ) versus an activity - rotation - age prescription (  [ rossby ] and  [ gyro ] ) .",
    "first , among the six stellar samples ( four open clusters and two binary samples ) , the activity - rotation - age technique resulted in smaller age dispersions for 5 of the 6 samples ( the exception being m67 ) .",

    "the improvement among 3 of the clusters ( pleiades , uma , hyades ) was typically a @xmath310% reduction in the age dispersion , equivalent to removing a @xmath30.1 dex source of systematic error .",
    "the two binary samples show marked improvements in their age dispersions  most notably the dispersion in age estimates among the color - separated binaries was reduced significantly by using the activity - rotation - age technique rather than a simple activity - age relation .",
    "the results for m67 are somewhat perplexing , and hint that our activity - rotation - age technique is not adequately modeling this @xmath34-gyr - old group .",
    "this is not surprising given that half of the m67 sample is hotter / bluer than the sun , and as figure [ fig : bv_per ] suggests , _ the gyro relations are not well - constrained for late - f / early - g stars for ages older than the hyades .",
    "_ we conclude by stating that the activity - rotation - age technique appears to give slightly more consistent ages among the older samples tested than by using a simple activity - age relation .",
    "while a rigorous utilization of the revised age - deriving methods for studying the star - formation history of the solar neighborhood is beyond the focus of this study , we briefly discuss some implications of our results for a small volume - limited sample of solar - type dwarfs .",

    "the sample consists of the nearest known dwarfs with 0.5 @xmath2 @xmath2 0.9 mag ( the color region where both the @xmath1 calculations and revised gyrochronology relations are constrained ) .",
    "a few of the entries are unresolved multiples , sometimes containing two or even three solar - type stars ( e.g. i boo ) .",

    "similarly , the stellar birthrate during the past gyr appears unremarkable compared to the past @xmath36 gyr .",
