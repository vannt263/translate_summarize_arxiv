    "strongly interacting bosonic systems have attracted a lot of recent interest@xcite .",

    "the bosonic systems are either tightly bound composites of fermions that act like effective bosonic particles with soft cores , or correspond to bosonic excitations that have repulsive interactions .",
    "for this reason , these systems are modeled by soft - core bosons which are described most simply by the bose hubbard model .",
    "various aspects of this model were investigated analytically by mean - field theory @xcite , by renormalization group techniques @xcite and by projection methods @xcite .",
    "the bose hubbard model has also been studied with quantum monte carlo methods ( qmc ) by batrouni et al .",

    ", the mott phase diagram is obtained from a strong - coupling expansion that has the correct dependence on spatial dimensionality , is as accurate as the qmc calculations , and agrees with the known exact solutions .",
    "preliminary results for the pure case have already appeared@xcite .",
    "the bose hubbard model is the minimal model which contains the key physics of the strongly interacting bose systems  the competition between kinetic and potential energy effects .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the boson annihilation operator at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the hopping matrix element between the site @xmath3 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the local site energy , @xmath7 is the strength of the on - site repulsion , and @xmath8 is the chemical potential .",
    "the hopping matrix is assumed to be a real symmetric matrix @xmath9 and the lattice is also assumed to be bipartite ; _",
    "i.  e. _ , the lattice may be separated into two sublattices ( the @xmath10 sublattice and the @xmath11 sublattice ) such that @xmath4 vanishes whenever @xmath3 and @xmath5 both belong to the same sublattice ( in particular , this implies @xmath12 ) .",
    "the local site energy @xmath6 is a quenched random variable chosen from a distribution of site energies that is symmetric about zero and satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "the pure case corresponds to all site energies vanishing @xmath14 .",
    "the form of the zero temperature ( @xmath15 ) phase diagram can be understood by starting from the strong - coupling or `` atomic '' limit @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "the kinetic energy vanishes ( @xmath16 ) and every site is occupied by a fixed number of bosons , @xmath17 . in the pure case ,",
    "the ground - state boson occupancy ( @xmath17 ) is the same for each lattice site , and is chosen to minimize the on - site energy . if the chemical potential , @xmath18 , is parameterized in terms of the deviation , @xmath19 , from integer filling @xmath17",
    ", then the on - site energy is @xmath20 , and the energy to add a boson onto a particular site satisfies @xmath21 .",
    "thus for a nonzero @xmath19 , a finite amount of energy is required to move a particle through the lattice .",
    "the bosons are incompressible and localized , which produces a mott insulator . for @xmath22",
    ", the ground - state energies of the two different boson densities are degenerate [ @xmath23 and no energy is needed to add or extract a particle ; _",
    "i. e. _ , the compressibility is finite and the system is a conductor . as the strength of the hopping matrix elements increases , the range of the chemical potential @xmath8 about which the system is incompressible decreases .",
    "the mott - insulator phase will completely disappear at a critical value of the hopping matrix elements . beyond this critical value of @xmath4",
    "the system is a superfluid .    in the disordered case , a mott - insulating phase may or may not exist depending upon the strength of the disorder .",
    "the energy to add a boson onto site @xmath3 becomes @xmath24 , so that the system is compressible if a site @xmath3 can be found which satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "if the disorder is assumed to be symmetrically bounded about zero ( @xmath26 ) then a mott insulator exists whenever @xmath27 .",
    "the ground - state boson occupancy is uniformly equal to @xmath17 within the mott insulating phase which extends from @xmath28 ( when @xmath29 ) .",
    "once again , the bosons are incompressible within the mott phase and the system is insulating .",
    "as the hopping matrix elements increase in magnitude , the range of the chemical potential within which the system is incompressible decreases until the mott phase vanishes at a critical value of the hopping matrix elements .",
    "the compressible phase will typically also be an insulator and is called a bose glass@xcite , but it has been conjectured that in some cases the transition proceeds directly from the mott insulator to the superfluid@xcite .",
    "the phase boundary between the incompressible phase ( mott insulator ) and the compressible phase ( superfluid or bose glass ) is determined here in a strong - coupling expansion by calculating both the energy of the mott insulator and of a defect state ( which contains an extra hole or particle ) in a perturbative expansion of the single - particle terms @xmath30 . at the point where the energy of the mott state is degenerate with the defect state , the system becomes compressible . in the pure case ,",
    "the compressible phase is also superfluid , but in the disordered case , the compressible phase is a bose glass ( except possibly at the tip of the mott lobe)@xcite .",
    "there are two distinct cases for the defect state : @xmath31 corresponds to adding a _ particle _ to the mott - insulator phase ( with @xmath17 bosons per site ) ; and @xmath32 corresponds to adding a _ hole _ to the mott - insulator phase ( with @xmath33 ) bosons per site .",
    "of course , the phase boundary depends upon the number of bosons per site , @xmath17 , of the mott insulator phase .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath34 the mott - insulating state is given by @xmath35 where @xmath17 is the number of bosons on each site , @xmath36 is the number of sites in the lattice and @xmath37 is the vacuum state .",
    "the defect state is characterized by one additional particle ( hole ) which moves coherently throughout the lattice . to zeroth order in the single - particle terms the wave function for the `` defect '' state",
    "is determined by degenerate perturbation theory : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 is the eigenvector of the corresponding single - particle matrix @xmath40 [ @xmath41 with the lowest eigenvalue ( the hopping matrix is assumed to have a nondegenerate lowest eigenvalue ) .",
    "it is well known that the minimal eigenvalue of the single - particle matrix @xmath42 is larger than the sum of the minimal eigenvalue of the hopping matrix plus the minimal eigenvalue of the disorder matrix .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that as the system size becomes larger and larger , the minimal eigenvalue approaches the sum of the minimal eigenvalues of the hopping matrix and of the disorder matrix as closely as desired@xcite ( because of the existence of arbitrarily large `` rare regions '' where the system looks pure with @xmath43 or with @xmath44 ) .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the perturbative energy of each defect state becomes @xmath45 @xmath46 to first order in @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the minimal eigenvalue of the hopping matrix @xmath49 . in the case of nearest - neighbor hopping on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath50-dimensions ,",
    "the number of nearest neighbors satisfies @xmath51 and the minimal eigenvalue is @xmath52 .",
    "the boundary between the incompressible phase and the compressible phase is determined when the energy difference between the mott insulator and the defect state vanishes ( the compressibility is assumed to approach zero continuously at the phase boundary ) .",
    "thus two branches of the mott lobe can be found depending upon whether the defect state is an additional hole or an additional particle .",
    "the two branches of the mott - phase boundary meet when @xmath53 the additional one on the left hand side arises because @xmath19 is measured from the point @xmath54 . equation ( [ eq : critical condition ] ) may be used to estimate the critical value of the hopping matrix element beyond which no mott - insulator phase exists .",

    "the agreement of the strong - coupling expansion with the exact results is quite good .    as a general rule",
    ", the truncated strong - coupling expansions appear to be more accurate in _ lower _ dimensions , which implies that the density fluctuations of the bose hubbard model are also more important in lower dimensions .    at this point",
    "we turn our attention to techniques which enable us to extrapolate the strong - coupling expansions to infinite order in hopes of determining a more accurate phase diagram .",
    "the simplest method is called critical - point extrapolation .",

    "since the second- and third - order expansions are expected to be more accurate than the first - order calculation , we adopt the following strategy for performing the extrapolations : the results of the second- and third - order expansions are extrapolated to @xmath105 to determine the estimate for the critical point , and the results of the first , second and third orders are then extrapolated to @xmath106 in order to estimate the error in the critical point , and to test the linear - extrapolation hypothesis .",

    "examination of the exact result for infinite dimensions ( [ eq : inf - d delta ] ) leads one to propose the following ansatz for the mott lobe in @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are regular functions of @xmath55 ( that should be accurately approximated by their power - series expansions ) and @xmath113 is the critical exponent for the @xmath85-dimensional @xmath86 model . in the unconstrained - scaling - analysis extrapolation method the exponent @xmath113",

    "we expect in the region in between the ( first - order ) infinite - dimensional phase boundary and that of the ( second - order ) infinite - range - hopping model that the compressibility will be exponentially small , and will only become sizable as the second - order phase boundary is crossed .    because the mott - phase to bose - glass phase transition is first order for the disordered case , and since the bose - glass to superfluid transition is always second order ( because it involves a collective excitation that extends through the entire lattice ) , it is quite unlikely that there would ever be a region where the mott phase has a transition directly to the superfluid .",
    "_ the presence of the lifshitz rare regions strongly supports the picture that the mott phase is entirely enclosed within the bose - glass phase .",
    "_ this result is _ independent _ of any perturbative arguments , since the rare regions must dominate the mott to bose - glass transition in the exact solution too .",
    "finally , we calculate the dependence of the critical value of @xmath55 at the tip of the mott - phase lobe , as a function of the disorder strength @xmath62 .",
    "figure 8 plots this value of @xmath156 versus @xmath62 for the one- , two- , and infinite - dimensional cases .",
    "the plot is limited to the lowest mott - phase lobe with @xmath157 .",
    "since the one - dimensional mott phase lobes have a cusp - like behavior that is removed when disorder is added to the system , we expect @xmath158 to decrease very rapidly for small disorder .",
    "this effect is sharply reduced in higher dimensions . in the strong - disorder limit , the phase diagram is dominated by the first - order terms in the perturbative expansion , which have a trivial dependence on the dimensionality , but the slopes curves of the curves are unequal because @xmath159 depends strongly upon the dimensionality .",
    "we have developed a strong - coupling perturbation - theory approximation to the bose hubbard model on a bipartite lattice .",
    "the perturbative results can be extrapolated in a number of different ways which either do or do not take into account the scaling theory of the critical point at the mott tip .",
    "we find that a perturbative expansion thru third order rivals the accuracy of the qmc simulations , and is likely the best method for determining the mott phase boundary of these interacting bose systems .",
    "we treated two different cases : the pure case and the disordered case . in the pure case",
    "the tip of the mott lobe satisfies a scaling relation because it corresponds to a second - order phase transition in a @xmath160-dimensional xy model .",
    "this is because the compressible phase is also superfluid which implies there is a diverging length scale at the phase transition .",
    "calculations in the pure case are insensitive to finite - size effects . in the disordered case we argued that the tip of the mott phase lobe corresopnds to a first - order phase transition because the initial single - particle excitations are localized into the rare regions of the lifshitz tails for any bounded disorder distribution . as a result",
    "there is a kink in the mott phase boundary since the slope of @xmath146 has a discontinuous jump at the tip of the lobe . in this case",
    ", there are strong finite - size effects because `` typical '' disorder distributions on finite lattices do not have lifshitz tails .",
    "the results of these perturbative calculations have been compared to the available qmc simulations .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the two and are unable to determine which method is more accurate in a quantitative determination of the phase boundaries .",
    "the perturbation theory described here falls short in one aspect ",
    "it is unable to determine the bose - glass  superfluid phase transition in the disordered case .",
    "it is possible that such a calculation could be performed , but since the particle density at which it occurs is a priori not known , and since the superfluid susceptibility diverges in the bose - glass phase , such a calculation may be problematic .",
