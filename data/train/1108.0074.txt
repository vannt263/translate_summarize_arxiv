    "our main result shows that if @xmath14 is a @xmath38 cellular flow , then we see a sharp transition between the homogenization and averaging regimes at @xmath39 .    before stating our precise results ( theorems  [ thmevalstrongflow ] and  [ thmevalhomog ] below )",
    ", we provide a brief explanation as to why one expects the transition to occur at @xmath39 . for simplicity and concreteness",
    ", we choose the stream function @xmath40 , and define @xmath41 . even in this simple setting , to the best of our knowledge , the transition from averaging to homogenization has not been studied before .",
    "first , for any _ fixed _",
    "@xmath0 , we let @xmath42 denote the effective diffusion matrix obtained in the limit @xmath26 ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . if @xmath43 is the mean zero , @xmath44-periodic solution to @xmath45 then the effective diffusivity ( as a function of @xmath0 ) is given by  . as @xmath4 , the behaviour of the correctors @xmath43 is well understood  @xcite . except on a boundary layer of order @xmath46 ,",
    "each of the functions  @xmath47 become constant in cell interiors .",
    "using this one can show ( see for instance  @xcite ) that asymptotically , as @xmath4 , the effective diffusion matrix behaves like @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the identity matrix , and @xmath50 is an explicitly computable constant .",
    "consequently , if we consider  , with the dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit square , we expect @xmath51    on the other hand , if we keep @xmath24 fixed and send @xmath4 , we know  @xcite that  @xmath13 becomes constant on stream lines of @xmath52 . in particular ,",
    "because of the dirichlet boundary condition on the outside boundary , we must also have @xmath53 on the boundary of all interior cells .",
    "since these cells have side length @xmath24 , we expect @xmath54 matching   and   leads us to believe @xmath55 marks the transition between the two regimes .",
    "with this explanation , we state our main results .",
    "our first two results study the averaging to homogenization transition for the principal dirichlet eigenvalue .",
    "let @xmath3 be an even integer , @xmath56\\times[-l/2,l/2]$ ] be a square of side length @xmath3 , and @xmath57 be given .",
    "we study the principal eigenvalue problem on @xmath58 @xmath59 as both @xmath60 .",
    "we observe two distinct behaviors of @xmath61 with a sharp transition . if @xmath62 , then the principal eigenvalue stays bounded , and can be read off using the variational principle in  @xcite in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "this is the averaging regime , and exactly explains  . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath63 , then the principal eigenvalue is of the order @xmath64 .",

    "is satisfied and the principal eigenvalue behaves like that of the homogenized equation .    in the averaging regime ( theorem  [ thmevalstrongflow ] ) , the proof of the upper bound in follows directly using ideas of  @xcite .",
    "the lower bound , however , is much more intricate .",
    "the main idea is to control the oscillation of @xmath13 between neighbouring cells , and use this to show that the effect of the cold boundary propagates inward along separatrices , all the way to the center cell .",
    "the techniques used are similar to  @xcite .",
    "the main new ( and non - trivial ) difficulty in our situation is that the number of cells also increases with the amplitude .",
    "this requires us to estimate the oscillation of @xmath13 between cells in terms of energies localised to each cell ( proposition  [ ppntotalosc ] , below ) . here",
    "the assumption that @xmath3 is not too large comes into play . finally , the key idea in the proof is to use a min - max argument ( lemma  [ lmagi ] , below ) to show that @xmath13 is small on the boundaries of all cells .",
    "moreover , once smallness on separatrices is established , our proof may be modified to show that under a stronger assumption @xmath79 we have a precise asymptotics @xmath80 where @xmath34 is a single cell .",
    "this is the same as the variational principle in  @xcite .",
    "we remark however that  @xcite only gives   for fixed @xmath3 as @xmath4 .    turning to the homogenization regime ( theorem  [ thmevalhomog ] ) , we remark first that homogenization of eigenvalues has not been as extensively studied as other homogenization problems .",
    "this is possibly because eigenvalues involve the infinite time horizon .",
    "we refer to  @xcite that all study self - adjoint problems for some results on the homogenization of the eigenvalues in oscillatory periodic media .",
    "the extra difficulties in the present paper come both from two sources .",
    "first , since the problem is not self adjoint , a variational principle for the eigenvalue is not available .",
    "second , as @xmath0 and @xmath3 tend to @xmath81 , we do nt have suitable aprori bounds because either the domain is not compact , or the effective diffusivity is unbounded .",
    "our proof uses a multi - scale expansion to construct appropriate sub and super solutions .",
    "when @xmath0 is fixed , it usually suffices to consider a multi - scale expansion to the first corrector .",
    "however , in our situation , this is not enough , and we are forced to consider a multi - scale expansion up to the second corrector",
    ".    of course an asymptotic profile , and explicit bounds are readily available  @xcite for the first corrector .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , bounds on the second corrector as @xmath4 have not been studied .",
    "there are two main problems to obtaining these bounds .",
    "the first problem is appearance of that terms involving the slow gradient of the second corrector multiplied by @xmath0 .",
    "in general , we have no way of bounding these terms .",
    "luckily , if we choose our slow profile to be quadratic , then these terms idnetically vanish and present no problem at all !",
    "the second problem with obtaining bounds on the second corrector is that it satisfies an equation where the first order terms depend on @xmath0 .",
    "so one would expect the bounds to also depend on @xmath0 , which would be catastrophic in our situation .",
    "however , for elliptic equations with a _ divergence free _ drift , we have apriori @xmath10 estimates which are _ independent _ of the drift  @xcite .",
    "this , combined with an explicit knowledge of the first corrector , allows us to obtain bounds on the second corrector that decay when @xmath63 .",
    "the sub and super solutions we construct for eigenvalue problem are done through the expected exit time .",
    "since these are interesting in their own right , we describe them below .",
    "let @xmath82 be the solution of @xmath83 where @xmath14 and @xmath58 are as in .",
    "though we do not use any probabilistic arguments in this paper , it is useful to point out the connection between @xmath84 and diffusions .",
    "let @xmath85 be the diffusion @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a standard @xmath44-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "it is well known that @xmath84 is the expected exit time of the diffusion @xmath85 from the domain @xmath58 .",
    "numerical simulations of three realizations of @xmath85 are shown in figure  [ figdiff ] .",
    "note that for `` small '' amplitude ( @xmath88 ) , trajectories of @xmath85 behave similarly to those of the brownian motion . for a `` large '' amplitude ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "trajectories of @xmath85 tend to move ballistically along the skeleton of the separatrices .",
    "similar to the eigenvalue problem , the behaviour of @xmath84 is described by two distinct regimes with a sharp transition . if @xmath62 , then the stirring is strong enough to force the diffusion @xmath85 to exit @xmath58 almost immediately along separatrices . in this case , we show that @xmath90 on separatrices , and is bounded everywhere else above by a constant independent of @xmath0 and @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath63 , then the stirring is not strong enough for the effect of the cold boundary to be felt in the interior . in this case , it takes the diffusion @xmath85 a very long time to exit from @xmath58 , and @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "a numerical simulation showing @xmath84 in each of these regimes is shown in figure  [ fgrtau ] .",
    "the precise results are as follows .",

    "consequently , @xmath91 as @xmath2 , uniformly on compact sets .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ ppnexittimestrongflow ] is similar steps to that of theorem  [ thmevalstrongflow ] . for the proof of theorem  [ ppnexittimehomog ] ,",
    "as mentioned earlier , we need to perform a multi - scale expansion up to two correctors , and choose the slow profile to be quadratic .",
    "when the domain is a disk , a quadratic function is exactly the solution to the homogenized problem !",
    "this gives us a sharper estimate for @xmath84 .",
    "[ prop - disk]let @xmath103 be a disk of radius @xmath3 , and @xmath104 be the solution of in @xmath103 . if @xmath0 and @xmath3 satisfy the assumptions in theorem  [ ppnexittimehomog ] then @xmath105 where @xmath106 is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath3 . here",

    ". thus   immediately implies  .    by fitting a disk inside , and outside a square , proposition  [ prop - disk ] quickly implies theorem  [ ppnexittimehomog ] .",
    "further , since it is well known that the principal eigenvalue is bounded below by the maximum expected exit time , the lower bound in theorem  [ thmevalhomog ] also quickly follows from proposition  [ prop - disk ] .",
    "the upper bound is a little more technical , however , also uses proposition  [ prop - disk ] as the main idea .",
    "we mention that we have chosen to use the particular form of the stream - function @xmath110 simply for the sake of convenience .",
    "all our results may be generalized to other periodic flows with a cellular structure without any difficulty .",
    "we also believe that for other flows the transition from the averaging to the homogenization regime happens when the effective diffusivity @xmath107 balances with the domain size @xmath3 .",
    "that is , when the `` homogenized eigenvalue '' @xmath111 is of the same order as the `` strong flow '' eigenvalue : @xmath112 we leave this question for a future study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the averaging regime is considered in sections  [ sec : eigfast ] and  [ sec : exitfast ] .",
    "the former contains the proof of theorem  [ thmevalstrongflow ] and the latter of theorem  [ ppnexittimestrongflow ] .",
    "the rest of the paper addresses the homogenization regime .",
    "the key step here is proposition  [ prop - disk ] proved in section  [ sxnhomogexittime ] . from this , theorem  [ ppnexittimehomog ] quickly follows , and the proof is presented the same section .",

    "this gives a finite upper bound for @xmath61 that is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of the proof is as follows .",
    "the basic idea is that if the domain size @xmath3 is not too large , and the flow is sufficiently strong , the eigenfunction @xmath13 should be small not only near the boundary @xmath130 but also on the whole skeleton of separatrices inside @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the whole domain @xmath58 is essentially equivalent to a one - cell dirichlet problem , which gives the correct asymptotics for the eigenvalue for @xmath0 large . to this end",
    ", we first estimate the oscillation of @xmath13 along a streamline of @xmath14 inside one cell that is sufficiently close to the separatrix , and show that this oscillation is small : see lemma  [ lmaosconsep ] .",
    "next , we show that the difference of the values of @xmath13 on two streamlines of @xmath14 ( sufficiently close to the separatrix ) in two neighbouring cells must be small , as in lemma  [ lmaoscbetweencells ] below .",
    "these two steps are very similar to those in  @xcite , and their proofs are only sketched .",
    "now , considering the ` worst case scenario ' of the above oscillation estimates , we obtain a pointwise upper bound on @xmath13 on streamlines of @xmath14 near separatrices in terms of the principal eigenvalue @xmath61 , and @xmath131 : see lemma  [ lmagi ] .",
    "next , we show that the streamlines above enclose a large enough region to encompass most of the mass of @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we use the drift independent apriori estimates in  @xcite to obtain the desired lower bound on @xmath61 .      the basic reason behind the fact that the eigenfunction is constant on streamlines is the following estimate , originally due to s. heinze  @xcite .",

    "notice that @xmath570 , and on the top and bottom boundary we have @xmath571 and @xmath572 .",
    "thus @xmath573 so choosing @xmath559 large enough , we can ensure @xmath574 on the top and bottom of @xmath542 .    on the left of @xmath542",
    ", we have @xmath575 and @xmath576 .",
    "so @xmath577 , and choosing @xmath559 large we can again ensure @xmath574 on the left of @xmath542 .",
    "finally , on the right of @xmath542 , we have @xmath578 and @xmath579 , and we immediately see that for @xmath559 large enough , we have @xmath580 on the right of @xmath542 . thus @xmath557 satisfies the boundary conditions in  .    to see that @xmath546 also satisfies the boundary conditions in  , we need to bound the correctors appropriately .",
    "exactly as in the proof of lemma  [ lmasupsolbis ] , we obtain @xmath581 where @xmath106 is independent of @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath492 .",
    "we remark that the extra @xmath582 factor arises because derivatives of @xmath557 are of the order @xmath582 and they appear as multiplicative factors in the expressions for @xmath560 and @xmath562 .    consequently ,",
    "if @xmath431 is chosen to be larger than @xmath345 , we have @xmath583 since @xmath557 already satisfies the boundary conditions in  , this immediately implies that @xmath546 must also satisfy these boundary conditions .",
    "finally , since @xmath557 certainly satisfies  , it follows from   that @xmath546 also satisfies  .",
    "this proves the existence of @xmath546 .",
    "now , as remarked earlier , the only thing remaining to complete the proof of the lemma is to verify that if the rectangle @xmath542 , and the coordinate frame are both rotated arbitrarily about the center of the annulus , then there still exists a function @xmath546 satisfying   and   in new coordinates .",
    "this , however , is immediate .",
    "the new coordinates can be expressed in terms of the old coordinates as a linear function .",
    "consequently , our initial profile for @xmath557 will still be a _",
    "quadratic _ function of the new coordinates .",
    "of course , by the rotational invariance of the laplacian , it will also be harmonic , and the remainder of the proof goes through nearly verbatim .",
    "the only modification is that after the rotation the mixed derivative @xmath584 no longer vanishes , and the terms involving @xmath585 and @xmath586 do appear in and .",
    "however , they can be treated in an identical fashion , as in the proof of lemma  [ lmasupsolbis ] using the precise asymptotics for @xmath587 and @xmath358 from  @xcite .",
    "this concludes the proof .      for a given @xmath436 , let @xmath527 be the solution of @xmath588 then",
    ", we have @xmath589 and @xmath590 consequently @xmath591 , where @xmath523 is the solution of   on the annulus @xmath592 . thus applying lemma  [ lmaannexittime ] , we see @xmath593    the function @xmath527 decreases at most linearly with @xmath594 .",
    "this can be seen immediately from an asymptotic expansion for a super solution . indeed , starting with @xmath595 and choosing @xmath560 and @xmath562 as in the proof of lemma  [ lmaeta ]",
    ", we immediately see that @xmath596 we remark again that the extra @xmath597 factor arises from the gradient of @xmath557 .",
    "now by rotating the initial profile @xmath557 appropriately , we obtain the linear decrease @xmath598 as claimed .",
    "we claim that   and   quickly conclude the proof . to see this , note first that equation   and   immediately give @xmath599 however , since @xmath600 on @xmath601 , the maximum principle implies that @xmath503 can not attain it s maximum in the interior of the annulus @xmath601 .",
    "consequently   must hold on the interior of the _ entire _ annulus @xmath602 .",
    "now if we choose @xmath436 large enough so that @xmath603 , and then choose @xmath604 large enough so that @xmath605 , we see that @xmath503 is forced to attain it s maximum on the inner boundary @xmath496 , and the lemma follows immediately ."
