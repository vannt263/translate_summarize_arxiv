    "the framework of this article is the study of the deformations of a discrete subgroup @xmath10 of a lie group @xmath11 in a lie group @xmath12 containing @xmath11 .",
    "this question has been addressed in many different contexts .",
    "a classical example is the one where @xmath10 is a fuchsian group , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath10 is discrete , such deformations are called quasi - fuchsian . we will be interested in the case where @xmath10 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath15 and @xmath12 is the group @xmath16 ( or their natural projectivisations over @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ) .",
    "the geometrical motivation is very similar : in the classical case mentioned above , @xmath19 is the orientation preserving isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space @xmath20 and a fuchsian group preserves a totally geodesic hyperbolic plane @xmath21 in @xmath20 . in our case",
    "@xmath22 is ( a triple cover of ) the holomorphic isometry group of complex hyperbolic 2-space @xmath6 , and the subgroup @xmath15 preserves a totally geodesic lagrangian plane isometric to @xmath21 .",
    "a discrete subgroup @xmath10 of @xmath23 is called @xmath17-fuchsian .",
    "a second example of this construction is where @xmath12 is again @xmath16 but now @xmath24 . in this case @xmath11 preserves a totally geodesic complex line in @xmath6 .",
    "a discrete subgroup of @xmath11 is called @xmath18-fuchsian .",
    "deformations of either @xmath17-fuchsian or @xmath18-fuchsian groups in @xmath16 are called complex hyperbolic quasi - fuchsian .",
    "see @xcite for a survey of this topic .",
    "the title of this article refers to the so - called _ riley slice of schottky space _ ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "riley considered the space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of @xmath19 generated by two non - commuting parabolic maps .",
    "this space may be identified with @xmath25 under the map that associates the parameter @xmath26 with the conjugacy class of the group @xmath27 , where @xmath28,\\   \\left[\\begin{matrix } 1 & 0 \\\\ \\rho & 1 \\end{matrix}\\right]\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] riley was interested in the set of those parameters @xmath29 for which @xmath27 is discrete .",
    "he was particularly interested in the ( closed ) set where @xmath27 is discrete and free , which is now called the riley slice of schottky space @xcite .",
    "this work has been taken up more recently by akiyoshi , sakuma , wada and yamashita . in their book",
    "@xcite they illustrate one of riley s original computer pictures , figure 0.2a , and their version of this picture , figure 0.2b .",
    "riley s main method was to construct the ford domain for @xmath27 .",
    "the different combinatorial patterns that arise in this ford domain correspond to the differently coloured regions in these figures from @xcite .",
    "riley was also interested in groups @xmath27 that are discrete but not free . in particular , he showed that when @xmath29 is a complex sixth root of unity then the quotient of hyperbolic 3-space by @xmath27 is the figure - eight knot complement",
    ".      the direct analogue of the riley slice in complex hyperbolic plane would be the set of conjugacy classes of groups generated by two non - commuting , unipotent parabolic elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath16 .",
    "( note that in contrast to to @xmath19 , there exist parabolic elements in @xmath16 that are not unipotent .",
    "in fact , there is a 1-parameter family of parabolic conjugacy classes , see for instance chapter 6 of @xcite . )",
    "this choice would give a four dimensional parameter space , and we require additionally that @xmath3 is unipotent ; making the dimension drop to @xmath30 . specifically , we define @xmath31    following riley , we are interested in the ( closed ) subset of @xmath32 where the group @xmath33 is discrete and free and our main method for studying this set is to construct the ford domain for its action on complex hyperbolic space @xmath6",
    ". we shall also indicate various other interesting discrete groups in @xmath32 but these will not be our main focus .    in section",
    "[ section - coordinates ] , we will parametrise @xmath4 so that it becomes the open square @xmath34 .",
    "the parameters we use will be the cartan angular invariants @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the triples of ( parabolic ) fixed points of @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively ( see section [ sec - cartan ] for the definitions ) .",
    "note that the invariants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined to lie in the closed interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "our assumption that @xmath1 and @xmath2 do nt commute implies that neither @xmath35 nor @xmath36 can equal @xmath40 ( see section [ section - coordinates ] ) .    when @xmath35 and @xmath36 are both zero , that is at the origin of the square , the group @xmath33 is @xmath17-fuchsian .",
    "the quotient of the lagrangian plane preserved by @xmath33 is a hyperbolic three times punctured sphere where the three ( homotopy classes of ) peripheral elements are represented by ( the conjugacy classes of ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the space @xmath4 can thus be thought of as the slice of the @xmath16-representation variety of the three times punctured sphere group defined by the conditions that the peripheral loops are mapped to unipotent isometries .",
    "we can now state our main discreteness result .",
    "[ thm - main ] suppose that @xmath41 is the group associated to parameters @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the polynomial given by @xmath45 then @xmath10 is discrete and isomorphic to the free group @xmath46 .",

    ". now define horoballs @xmath50 and @xmath51 by applying the side pairing maps to @xmath48 .",
    "since every cycle in the graph gives rise either to the identity map or to a parabolic map , this process is well defined and gives rise to a consistent system of horoballs .",
    "therefore we can apply the poincar polyhedron theorem for the two limit groups . using the same arguments as we did for groups in the interior of @xmath7",

    "recall that the ( ideal boundary of ) the side @xmath56 is the part of @xmath57 which is outside ( the ideal boundary of ) all other isometric spheres .",
    "in this section , when we speak of sides and ridges we implicitly mean their intersection with @xmath58 .",
    "we will see that each isometric sphere in @xmath55 contributes a side @xmath56 made up of one quadrilateral , denoted by @xmath59 and one bigon @xmath60 .",
    "a very similar configuration of isometric spheres has been observed by deraux and falbel in @xcite .",
    "we begin by analysing the contribution of @xmath61 .",
    "[ prop - part - outside ] the side @xmath62 of @xmath53 has two connected components .    1",

    "to finish the proof , consider the involution @xmath75 defined in the proof of proposition [ prop - dec - st ] .",
    "( note that since @xmath76 this involution conjugates @xmath52 to itself . ) in heisenberg coordinates it is defined by @xmath77\\longmapsto [ -\\overline{z},-t]$ ] and is clearly a cygan isometry . as in proposition",

    "moreover , since it is a cygan isometry , @xmath75 preserves @xmath61 and interchanges @xmath82 and @xmath83 and thus it also exchanges the two curves @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "it is fixed by @xmath75 , and belongs to the common exterior of both @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
