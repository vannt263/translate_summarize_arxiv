    "the precession of magnetic moments in an applied magnetic field is relevant for many classes of materials studies .",
    "precession is usually observed through microwave absorption , as in electron spin resonance ( esr ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , or ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) , combining the response from all species present . in complex materials and heterostructures ,",
    "time - domain optical techniques have proven useful to separate precessional dynamics at different atomic sites through the photon energy dependence of the response .",
    "site - specific measurement of esr@xcite and nmr@xcite precession has been achieved in semiconductors using visible optical pump - probe techniques .",
    "fmr precession of ferromagnetic alloys and heterostructures is technologically important since it determines data rates ( switching speeds ) of spin electronics devices .",
    "the magnetic moments on @xmath4 and @xmath5 sites in a random ferromagnetic alloy @xmath6 are usually believed to be parallel and collinear , due to strong exchange forces , either in static equilibrium or precessional motion . however , noncollinear static moments are predicted as the ground state in random ni@xmath7fe@xmath8 alloy systems , particularly near @xmath9.@xcite the random site disorder plays a strong role in the reduction of collinearity , evidenced in the 30% reduction of exchange stiffness for @xmath10 ( ni@xmath11fe ) upon an order - disorder transformation.@xcite in ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 ( permalloy , ) total energy calculations predict a 1 - 2 @xmath3 average angle of moment noncollinearity at t=0.@xcite    the magnetization dynamics of ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 have been studied more intensively than those of any other alloy . given the noncollinear ground - state alignment predicted for ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 , it is natural to ask whether a small net misalignment of ni and fe moments may also exist in a low - energy configuration accessible at short times and finite temperatures .",
    "the different moments in the alloy ( 2.5 vs. 1.6 @xmath12/atom)@xcite and different effective gyromagnetic ratios @xmath13 in elemental crystals ( 2.20 vs. 2.11)@xcite of ni and fe suggest different natural angular velocities for the motion of elemental moments .",
    "an element - specific measurement of magnetization precession can provide a direct test for the presence of a phase lag between @xmath14 and @xmath15 in coupled motion .",
    "an element - specific measurement of ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) precession has not been available previously .",
    "an x - ray optical technique , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) , is a well - established , quantitative , element - specific measurement of magnetic moment@xcite ; however , its previously demonstrated time - domain extension shows resolution of @xmath16 .",
    "this has been sufficient to characterize 180@xmath3 reversal dynamics in buried magnetic layers@xcite , but is insufficient to characterize fmr precession at frequencies of @xmath17 .    .",

    "improved time resolution ( @xmath22 fwhm ) has been achieved in part through the use of a fast - falltime squarewave magnetic field pulse delivered through a coplanar waveguide ( cpw).@xcite we verify coupled precession of elemental moments within instrumental resolution .",
    "time - resolved xmcd ( tr - xmcd ) measurements were carried out at beamline 4-id - c of the advanced photon source in argonne , il .",
    "the circular dichroism signal was obtained in reflectivity at near grazing incidence ( see fig [ diag ] ) , using photon helicity @xmath23 switching ( @xmath24 ) at the elliptical undulator for fixed applied field @xmath25 .",
    "reflected intensity was read at a soft x - ray photodiode and normalized to an incident intensity at a reference grid .",
    "the measurement technique is photon - in / photon out and should therefore minimize artifacts from time - varying stray magnetic fields .",
    "time resolution was achieved through a pump - probe technique .",
    "fast fall - time magnetic field pulses ( pump ) were synchronized with variable delay to x - ray photon bunches from the aps storage ring ( probe . )",
    "the repetition frequencies of photon bunches and magnetic field pulses were both 88.0 mhz ( 11.37 ns period ) ; therefore , source or detector gating was not required .",
    "the magnetic field delivery configuration is similar to that used in a pulsed inductive microwave permeameter ( pimm ) .",
    "fast fall - time current pulses ( @xmath26 150ps ) were delivered from a commercial pulse generator and through a cpw located under the magnetic thin film , providing pulsed transverse fields @xmath2 10 oe in amplitude .",
    "pulses terminated into a 20 ghz sampling oscilloscope with 27 db attenuation for pulse waveform characterization or directly into a 50@xmath27 load during tr - xmcd measurement .",
    "the cpw center conductor was aligned along @xmath28 , generating pulse fields @xmath29 .",
    "orthogonal helmholtz coils apply longitudinal bias @xmath30 or transverse magnetic field bias @xmath31",
    ".    experimental system time resolution can be estimated by using the finite photon bunch length @xmath32 and the timing jitter in the current pulse delivery electronics @xmath33 .",
    "separate streak camera measurements provide rms bunch length @xmath34@xcite and sampling oscilloscope measurements provide rms timing jitter @xmath35 . adding these contributions in quadrature yields a net timing resolution of @xmath36 rms or 90 ps fwhm .",
    "the ni@xmath0fe@xmath1(50nm)/ta(2 nm ) thin film was deposited on the cpw using ion beam sputtering at a base pressure of 5@xmath3710@xmath38 torr .",

    "well - defined hard - axis loop behavior is shown with an anisotropy field @xmath20 of 11.8 @xmath52 1.0 oe ( fig [ calib ] , right ) ; the fe dichroism signal is roughly a factor of two larger than the ni dichroism signal , consistent with previous work@xcite and the smaller number of holes in ni .",

    "the pulse field @xmath60 was taken to be proportional to the transmitted current waveform @xmath61 at the oscilloscope ; scaling for the pulse was found by fitting the steady - state pre- and post - falling edge levels of magnetization angle @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , yielding maximum pulse field level @xmath18=7.2 oe .",

    "measured points for ni and fe are shown with the single - domain model fit.[diffangle ] ]    element - specific precession is shown in figure [ both - fe - ni ] .",
    "ni and fe moments are shown to precess together within instrumental resolution ( @xmath5245 ps ) . as the longitudinal bias field @xmath19 increases , the precessional frequency increases for both elements and there is no apparent development of a phase lag greater than experimental error .",

    "the measurement provides direct experimental confirmation that the net fe and ni elemental moments are collinear during precession at time scales exceeding 90 ps .",
    "it should be noted that this result could not have been easily determined without assumption from existing measurement techniques such as pimm or time - resolved magnetooptical kerr effect .",
    "the result indicates that the exchange force exceeds the tendency of moments on ni and fe to precess or relax at different rates .",
    "the time resolution of the experiment is on the order of the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath69 characterized for gd@xcite , 100 @xmath52 80 ps , which characterizes the direct spin - to - lattice relaxation channel ; these values are unknown for transition metals but can be expected to be within an order of magnitude .",
    "a tendency for fe and ni moments to relax at different rates is plausible based on the orbital to spin moment ratios @xmath70 of ni and fe characterized in ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 by xmcd , 0.12 and 0.08 respectively.@xcite    the prospect of partially - coupled motion is more likely in systems where exchange coupling is weaker and/or magnetic moments are more localized .",
    "transition - metal - rare - earth alloys , featuring lower curie temperatures and more isolated @xmath71-shells on the rare - earths , would be attractive systems to study using the technique .",
    "many rare - earth dopants in ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 have been found to increase the fmr loss@xcite , and tr - xmcd can test the possibility that some loss is carried by a phase lag between re and tm moments.@xcite similarly , the trilayer structures used in spin electronics ( e.g. nife / cu / cofe ) offer the possibility of continuous adjustment of interlayer coupling through the spacer thickness .",
    "finally , we note the possibility of additional studies through more detailed spectroscopic information .",
    "spin and orbital moment dynamics may be separated on individual elements through the use of sum rules .",
    "we take the point time resolution as that of the measurement ; it should be noted that edge resolution , with long enough averaging and continuous monitoring for drift of the pulse amplitude @xmath18 , could be improved .",
    "better control over pulse delivery jitter will allow a point resolution limited only by @xmath32 and longer averaging could allow edge resolution better than that of the lower bound of @xmath69 .",
    "we have separated ni and fe moment motion in ni@xmath0fe@xmath1 by tr - xmcd , demonstrating elemental resolution in ferromagnetic resonance up to 2.6 ghz . coupled motion of elemental moments",
