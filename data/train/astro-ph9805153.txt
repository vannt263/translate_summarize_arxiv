    "a significant fraction of nearby galaxies have strong , centrally concentrated infrared sources indicative of rapid star formation in their central few hundred parsecs ( rieke and lebofsky 1979 ; devereux , becklin , & scoville 1987 ) .",
    "these so - called starburst galaxies make a dramatic contribution to the star formation activity in the local universe ; heckman ( 1997 ) calculates that just four galaxies ( of which  is one ) are responsible for 25% of the high - mass star formation within 10  mpc .",
    "local starburst galaxies serve as a model for galaxy formation and evolution at higher redshifts .",
    "an understanding of how these events occur and evolve will require study over the full range of scale and age .",
    "at the same time , very detailed modeling is required of the nearest starbursts such as  to provide templates for models of less accessible systems .    has been observed extensively in all accessible spectral regions ( e.g. , radio : ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ; molecular line emission : mauersberger et al .",

    "the subsequent observations taken together have substantially expanded on our knowledge of the starburst phenomenon from the inputs to that model , demonstrating the presence of supernovae remnants and hii regions , young ultracompact star clusters , a hot superwind , and a host of other starburst phenomena .",
    "young starbursts , including , are characterized by high levels of interstellar extinction that can make properties deduced from optical measurements unrepresentative ( e.g. , rieke  1980 ; puxley 1991 ) .",
    "consequently , infrared measurements play a critical role in defining nebular properties , morphologies , rotation curves , and other parameters .",
    "we have added to the extensive infrared observations of this galaxy with the deep nir images covering a wide ( @xmath3 ) field , narrowband images in  and 2 , near- and mid - infrared spectra , and a high - resolution spectral map of 2 .    since the first models of m  82 and  ( rieke et al .",
    "1980 ) , evolutionary synthesis modeling has become an important component of starburst study ( e.g. , doyon , joseph , & wright 1994 ; leitherer & heckman 1995 and references therein ; schinnerer  1997 ) .",
    "we interpret the new infrared measurements with the other properties of  through a modern synthesis model ( rieke  1993 , hereafter rlrt93 ) . in this way",
    ", the behavior of  can be related consistently to that of other galaxies we have modelled as part of a comprehensive study of nearby starbursts : ngc  6946 ( engelbracht 1996 , hereafter errl96 ) and m  82 ( mcleod  ( 1993 ) ; rlrt93 ) ; a number of blue dwarf galaxies ( vanzi & rieke 1997 ) , and a sample of interacting galaxies ( vanzi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the  starburst is at a relatively late stage of development , during which the high rate of supernova explosions leads to behavior that places it as a transition object between pure starbursts and weak - liners .",

    "broadband images in the j , h , and k@xmath0 bands as well as narrowband images with 0.5% bandwidth filters tuned to  and the ( 1,0)s(1 ) line of 2  were obtained at the steward observatory 1.55 m telescope using a camera equipped with a nicmos3 array .",
    "the data were reduced as described in errl96 .",
    "the deep broadband images were flux - calibrated using the ukirt faint standard number 2 ( courteau 1994 ) .",
    "we calibrated the k@xmath0-band image to k - band magnitudes using the standard - star photometry , and will hereafter refer to this image as the k - band image .",
    "we have ignored the small color correction between the k@xmath0 and k band , since this correction is smaller than the photometric uncertainty .",
    "we present photometry of the nucleus in table  [ tbl : phot ] in several circular apertures , plus a region the size of our extracted slit aperture ( used to calibrate our spectra . )",
    "photometric errors were estimated from the dispersion in multiple measurements of the standard star at different airmasses and are typically 2% in the j and h bands and 4%-5% in the k band .",
    "the broadband images are presented in figure  [ fig : bbimages ] .",
    "the images have a scale of 09 per pixel and the coordinate system is plotted assuming that the intensity peak of the infrared images corresponds to the position of  quoted in ned ( nasa extragalactic database ) : @xmath4  45  059 , @xmath5  33  40 .",
    "this position closely matches the position of the k - band peak found by sams  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the narrow - band images are presented in figure  [ fig : nbimages ] .",
    "these images are the differences between the on - line and off - line images . in the same figure",
    ", we present @xmath6 and @xmath7 color maps of the nuclear region , which show that the galaxy colors become very red on the nucleus due to strong extinction .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectra of  in the j , h , and k bands at a resolution of @xmath8 with the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope using fspec , a near - infrared long - slit spectrometer ( williams 1993 ) .",
    "the slit was centered on the infrared peak of the galaxy with a slit - viewing infrared guide camera . observing and data - reduction techniques are as described in errl96 , with the exception that a more precise wavelength calibration was obtained using a set of numerically computed wavelengths for the oh airglow lines ( c. kulesa , private communication ) .    to correct the spectra for atmospheric absorptions , a spectrum of hr  173 , a g3v star about 2  away from ,",
    "was taken close in time to the galaxy observations and was divided into the galaxy spectrum .",
    "this step introduced spurious emission features into the spectrum due to intrinsic absorptions in the standard star . to correct for these features",
    ", we multiplied our galaxy spectrum by the high - resolution solar spectrum ( smoothed to our instrumental resolution ) obtained by livingston & wallace ( 1992 ) .",
    "most of the spectra were obtained with the slit oriented along the major axis of the galaxy , while two key grating settings which cover the ( 1,0)s(1 ) line of 2 , , and the ( 2,0 ) and ( 3,1 ) co bands were obtained with the slit oriented along the minor axis .",
    "the j , h , and k - band spectra are presented in figures [ fig : jspec ] , [ fig : hspec ] , and [ fig : kspec ] , respectively .",
    "each spectrum is the sum of 10 12 pixels along the slit , centered on the intensity peak .",
    "we have computed a 1-@xmath9 uncertainty for each point in the spectrum from the dispersion in the set of individual observations .",
    "this error spectrum is plotted above each flux spectrum . the flux scale for each spectrum",
    "was taken from the broadband images , using the 24@xmath1012  aperture in table  [ tbl : phot ] .",
    "we obtained additional spectra of  in the j and k bands at a resolution of @xmath1 1200 using the same instrument and telescope .",
    "the slit was again oriented along the major axis of the galaxy and we extracted a similar aperture from these spectra .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a similar fashion to the high - resolution spectra , with the exception that our standard star was hr  232 , an a3v , so the only correction for intrinsic absorption was to interpolate over the h lines .",
    "the use of a hotter standard star ( in which metal lines are presumably weak or undetectable at this resolution ) to correct these spectra allows us to confirm that our correction for the intrinsic absorptions ( other than h ) in the standard star used for the high - resolution data was accurate .",
    "the low - resolution spectra ( figures  [ fig : jspec - lr ] and [ fig : kspec - lr ] ) , while lacking some of the detail in the high - resolution ones , give access to several additional 2  and 2lines as well as some unidentified features in the j band .",
    "the strong features beyond 2.4  not marked as 2  lines are narrow telluric absorptions which are poorly sampled at our low resolution and which appear as emission features after the spectrum is divided by the standard star .",
    "all measurements taken from the near - infrared spectra are derived from the high - resolution spectra when possible .",
    "a difficulty with interpreting near - infrared spectra of starburst galaxies is that weak nebular emission lines are lost in the structure of the stellar absorption features . to counteract this problem ,",
    "we have used a library of stellar spectra ( to be published separately ) to model the galaxy continuum .",
    "we selected a suite of fifteen stars which minimized the residual continuum when subtracted from the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the resulting mix of stars is thus not optimized in a population synthesis sense , but was empirically chosen to be a good match to the galaxy continuum .",
    "we redshifted the stellar spectra to the galaxy velocity , broadened them to match the velocity dispersion in the galaxy ( see  [ sec : disp ] ) , scaled them , and subtracted them from the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectra of  are shown in the lower parts of figures  [ fig : hspec ] and [ fig : kspec ] .",
    "the h - band and k - band flux measurements of emission lines presented in this paper are taken from the continuum - subtracted spectra .",
    "we obtained spectra of the 4  10.5  line in  using the irshell spectrograph ( lacy et al .",
    "1989 ) on the nasa infrared telescope facility .",
    "the 10  long by 2  wide slit was positioned across the nucleus of the galaxy at pa=61 .",
    "additional spectra were measured with parallel slit positions , one slit width to either side of the nucleus .",
    "the 10@xmath1064 si : as array provided 1sampling along the slit and a spectral resolution of 30  .",
    "the seeing was poor and the sky was partly cloudy .",
    "dc sky levels were monitored to identify frames that were contaminated by clouds .",
    "a dome - temperature card , chopped against the sky , was used for flat - fielding , atmospheric correction , and fluxing ( lacy et al .",
    "the data were reduced using a software package developed by achtermann ( 1994 ) .",
    "we mapped the 2 12.8  emission from  by using irshell in scanning mode ( lacy & achtermann 1994 ) , sweeping the slit back and forth across the galaxy by 22 .",
    "the off - source positions at the ends of the scans were averaged to produce a sky frame .",
    "the data were combined to form a 22@xmath1022  by 64 spectral channel data cube .",
    "a position - velocity plot of the 2  line is shown in figure  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "the 2  has a spatial extent of 6  and a velocity width of 150  fwhm .",
    "the integrated 2  flux is 4.6@xmath110.1 @xmath10 10@xmath12  . for comparison , roche & aitken ( 1985 ) report a measurement of 3.3 @xmath10 10@xmath12  .",
    "the 4  spectra showed a compact ( 2@xmath102 ) continuum source with only a hint of line emission at a level of @xmath13  .",
    "since the 2  is spread over 6 spatial and 10 spectral pixels , we determined an upper limit of @xmath14  on the 4  flux by summing over 6 spatial rows ( see figure  [ fig : midir ] ) and 10 spectral pixels .",
    "the values of the parameters that characterize the  starburst are summarized in table  [ tbl : summ ] .",
    "they have been determined assuming a distance of 2.5 mpc ( de vaucouleurs 1978 ) , at the low end of the range of 2.5 - 3.5 mpc in the literature . as discussed in errl96",
    ", a small distance places the most conservative constraints on our starburst models .",
    "the reference aperture we will use is 75 in radius .",
    "we chose this radius because most of the 2 , , and 2  flux ( as measured in our spectra and narrow - band images ) and the radio flux ( as measured in the continuum observations of antonucci & ulvestad ( 1988 ) or turner & ho ( 1983 ) ) arise from within it .",
    "the 10 , 20 and 30maps of  from telesco , dressel , & wolstencroft ( 1993 ) as well as the far - infrared measurements by smith & harvey ( 1996 ) also show that most of the mid- and far - infrared flux is produced in this region .",
    "we can use line ratios from our spectra to determine the extinction .",
    "if the hydrogen recombination line ratios from table  [ tbl : hlines ] obey case b , a foreground screen model with @xmath15 can fit them ( c.f .",
    "calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) .",
    "( we have used an analytical fit to the rieke & lebofsky 1985 extinction law , the hummer & storey 1987 theoretical recombination line ratios , and have included an 8% uncertainty in the relative flux calibration in the line ratio uncertainties . )",
    "this fit roughly agrees with the strength ( beck & beckwith 1984 ) .",
    "however , the mm - wave h recombination lines still suggest that a significant amount of ionized gas may be hidden by extreme optical depths ( puxley et al .",
    "the ratio of 2(1.257 ) to 2(1.644 ) should be 1.35 according to the a - values of nussbaumer & storey ( 1988 ) , although this value is subject to some uncertainty .",
    "the observed value is @xmath16 ( table  [ tbl : felines ] ) , which implies @xmath17 , consistent with the estimate from the h recombination lines .",
    "the colors of our broadband images can also be used to estimate extinction .",
    "a typical evolved stellar population has @xmath6 and @xmath7 colors of 0.7 and 0.2 ( aaronson 1977 ) , and our starburst models ( rlrt93 ) show that the same is true for the starburst population . our spectra show that the near - infrared continuum is dominated by starlight , as the strengths of the absorption features are typical of a population of supergiants and are consistent between the h and k bands , thus arguing against veiling by a featureless continuum .",
    "therefore , we can assume that colors redder than nominal are purely due to reddening .    from table  [ tbl : phot ] ,",
    "the near - infrared colors in our 15reference aperture are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , implying color excesses of 0.39 and 0.46 , respectively . using an analytical fit to the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) extinction law and a foreground screen geometry for the dust",
    ", @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath21 magnitudes of visual extinction while @xmath22 implies  @xmath23 .",
    "the extinction values in the near - infrared bands implied by our @xmath7 color are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the extinction to the stars appears to be slightly smaller ( at @xmath13@xmath9 significance ) than that to the ionized region .",
    "if we adopt a more realistic dust geometry than a foreground screen , such as the `` starburst '' model of witt , thronson , & capuano ( 1992 ) , we obtain a better fit to the observed colors .",
    "the colors in the nuclear region of  are slightly redder than the most heavily extinguished models presented by witt , so we have used polynomial fits to extrapolate beyond their values .",
    "the models imply a total extinction to the center of the system , ( cen ) , of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , based on the @xmath6 and @xmath7 excesses respectively .",
    "although this model contains much more total dust than a foreground screen model , much of the light comes from relatively unextinguished stars , so that the implied average equivalent extinction is similar to the foreground screen case .",
    "the equivalent extinction values in the near - infrared are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 from the @xmath6 color and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 from the @xmath7 color .    since the equivalent extinction values in",
    "the near infrared are similar for the two dust geometries , the near infrared fluxes can be corrected reliably .",
    "we will adopt extinction values that are an average of those derived from the mixed model : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we have used the @xmath7 color map to deredden our k - band image .",
    "we assumed that the intrinsic @xmath7 color of the galaxy was 0.2 ( so that @xmath38 ) and converted the color excess to a dereddening map using the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) extinction law .",
    "the k - band image was then multiplied by the dereddening image to produce the extinction - corrected k - band image of the galaxy presented in figure  [ fig : deproj ] .",
    "we also deprojected the dereddened image by stretching it along the minor axis by a factor @xmath39 , where we have taken @xmath40 ( pence 1981 ) .",
    "the resulting image is also presented in figure  [ fig : deproj ] .      the high sensitivity and broad wavelength coverage of our near - infrared spectra",
    "has allowed us to measure seven 2  lines , listed in table  [ tbl : felines ] , allowing an estimate of the electron density in the 2-emitting region .",
    "we use the ratios @xmath41/@xmath42  and @xmath43/@xmath42  and the models of bautista & pradhan ( 1996 ) . in the range of interest ,",
    "the diagnostic ratios we have chosen are essentially independent of temperature .",
    "we have plotted the values of these two line ratios ( corrected for extinction ) as a function of density in figure  [ fig : feplot ] . for each curve , we have marked the range consistent with the observations as a shaded box , indicating a mean density of @xmath44 .    2  emission in starbursts is thought to arise predominantly from supernova remnants .",
    "for example , greenhouse  ( 1991 ) find peaks on bright radio compact sources in the 2  surface brightness in m  82 .",
    "however , these compact sources account for only a small fraction of the total 2  emission .",
    "forbes & ward ( 1993 ) find a correlation between nonthermal 6 cm emission and 2 .",
    "however , the trend line is offset from that for supernova remnants .",
    "vanzi & rieke ( 1997 ) explain this offset in terms of the short lifetime for the 2-emitting stage in a supernova remnant .",
    "our data add to the arguments favoring a supernova origin for the 2 , since the density we derive is in good agreement with that observed in the supernova remnants observed by oliva , moorwood , & danziger ( 1989 ) .",
    "vanzi & rieke ( 1997 ) used the observed supernova rate in m  82 to derive a relation between the 2  luminosity and the supernova rate . to apply this relation ,",
    "we correct our observed 2(@xmath451.644 ) flux ( from table  [ tbl : felines ] ) to a 15  aperture using the ratio of the k - band fluxes in the 15  and 24  @xmath10  12  apertures ( this scaling is reasonable because the k - band flux is dominated by cool supergiants which are the immediate precursors to the supernova remnants ) .",
    "we also correct for 1.33 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "we obtain a total 2  flux of @xmath46  , or a luminosity of @xmath47  erg / s .",
    "the vanzi & rieke relation then implies a supernova rate of 0.03 per year .",
    "if the 2-emitting phase of each supernova remnant lasts @xmath48 years , this rate implies that there are currently @xmath49 2-emitting supernova remnants in the nucleus of .",
    "ulvestad & antonucci ( 1997 ) find an upper limit on the supernova rate of 0.3  yr@xmath50 .",
    "the supernovae have also been modeled by colina & prez - olea ( 1992 ) , who estimate a rate of 0.05 yr@xmath50 , and by van buren & greenhouse ( 1994 ) and paglione et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who both find 0.08 yr@xmath50 . these estimates are all based on modeling supernova counts and hence are to first order distance - independent . the sn rate can also be estimated from other luminosities than that of 2 .",
    "for example , if we assume the nonthermal radio flux from turner & ho ( 1983 ) is entirely due to synchrotron emission from supernova remnants , we can derive a supernova rate of 0.03  yr@xmath50 using equation ( 8) of condon & yin ( 1990 ) .",
    "all of the other rate estimates are in satisfactory agreement with our estimate using the 2  emission . both of the luminosity - based estimates are lower than those from supernova counts by a factor of about two .",
    "although this difference is probably within the errors , if the galaxy were at 3.5  mpc ( within the uncertainty in distance ) , the luminosity - based rates would double and the agreement would be improved .      the difference in ionization potentials of s@xmath51 and ne@xmath52 makes the 4/2  ratio a sensitive indicator of the effective temperature of the uv radiation field .",
    "the ratio is also dependent on the relative abundances of sulphur and neon , but the strong temperature dependence should dominate in our data .",
    "we apply an extinction correction of  =  14  mag to the mid - infrared data , based on the /  data of rieke  ( 1980 ) .",
    "this large extinction only changes the 4/2  color by 0.26 dex ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) to log(4/2 )  @xmath53 , or a @xmath54 upper limit of @xmath55 .",
    "we compare these values to single star photoionization cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) models to determine effective temperatures as a function of ionization parameter , obtaining upper limits of 36000 k , 38000 k , and 49000 k respectively for logu  @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the weak detection of [ ] on the central slit position implies effective temperatures of 34400 k , 36000 k , and 42300 k for the respective logu values .",
    "the main problem with this technique is the strong dependence of the 4/2  ratio on ionization parameter .",
    "the lyman continuum flux is @xmath58  s@xmath50 ( see  [ sec : uvflux ] ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : nbimages ] , we see that all of the  flux comes from within a radius of 7 , or 90  pc . from heckman  ( 1990 )",
    ", the nucleus has an electron density of at least 600  @xmath59 and probably higher since dust would have hidden the nucleus at 6700   .",
    "an electron density range of 600 - 1000  @xmath59 gives @xmath60logu  @xmath61 .",
    "it would take a large amount of substructure in the nucleus with a density of n@xmath62  @xmath59 to give logu  @xmath63 .",
    "for the logu  @xmath64 and logu  @xmath65 cases , we examined a two star model , one star with t  =  t@xmath66 and the other with t  =  40000 k. we determined how bright the 40000 k star would have to be relative to the t@xmath66 star to alter the 4/2  ratio by 0.15 dex , or roughly 1@xmath9 .",
    "for the four cases : logu , t@xmath67 , 34400 ; @xmath601.5 , 36000 ; @xmath602.5 , 36000 ; @xmath602.5 , 38000 we found that the 40000 k star contributed the following percentages of the lyman continuum photons : 2.5 ; 7.4 ; 6.8 ; 31 .",
    "these percentages can be combined with the starburst models of section  [ sec : models ] to determine the age of the starburst . as discussed below",
    ", the effective temperature is unlikely to be as high as 38000  k , so a conservative upper limit to the ionizing flux contribution by stars hotter than 40000  k is probably 15% .",
    "vanzi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that the ratio hei(1.7)/br10 is useful to constrain the temperature of the hot stars because it is not heavily affected by reddening or electron temperature .",
    "our upper limit for the 1.7@xmath68 m hei line ( table  [ tbl : helines ] ) corresponds to an upper limit of hei(1.7)/br10 @xmath69 0.2 , placing an upper limit of @xmath137,000k on the stellar temperature exciting the ism .",
    "carral et al . (",
    "1994 ) use the far infrared fine structure lines to derive an effective temperature for the exciting stars of @xmath70k .",
    "thus , three independent means of estimating the temperature of the exciting stars from infrared spectra give consistent results of t@xmath71  k. the /h@xmath72 ratio would give a value a few thousand degrees higher than the infrared indicators .",
    "however , we show in section 5.4 that a significant portion of the  may be shock - excited in supernova remnants .",
    "also , at @xmath73 solar and higher metallicities , it is expected that /h@xmath72 and other optical indicators will overestimate the temperature of the photoionizing field for a variety of reasons , such as an increase in electron temperature due to depletion onto grains or to photoelectric heating ( shields & kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "our cloudy models show the infrared - line - derived temperatures to be virtually independent of electron temperature ( c.f .",
    "vanzi  1996 ) .      in a dusty region full of young stars ( such as a nuclear starburst )",
    "much of the stellar radiation is reprocessed by dust , so the far - infrared luminosity serves as a reliable estimate of the integrated output of the hot stellar population .",
    "we have estimated a luminosity of @xmath74  from measurements at 1.3 mm ( krgel  1990 ) , the submillimeter ( gear  1986 ) , the far - infrared ( smith & harvey 1996 , plus iras measurements from rice  1988 ) , and the mid - infrared ( rieke & low 1975 ) .",
    "the small - beam measurements by smith & harvey proved useful in determining the fraction of luminosity actually arising from the starburst , as the scans of rice  show that a non - negligible fraction of the far - infrared luminosity in  is due to a cool extended component . this value should be considered a lower limit to the total luminosity , since a significant amount of energy may be escaping perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we have computed a lower limit to the k - band luminosity of the underlying stellar component by fitting an exponential disk model to the k - band light at large radii ( c.f .",
    "forbes & depoy 1992 ) and computing the integrated light contribution of this model in the central 15 .",
    "the absolute k magnitude of this component is @xmath6018.3 , less than 15% of the total k - band light after accounting for extinction .",
    "virtually any more sophisticated model , such as allowing the old stars to be more centrally concentrated , will increase this proportion .    using bc@xmath75 and m@xmath76",
    ", we compute that the bolometric luminosity of the underlying population is less than @xmath77  , or less than 2% of the observed value , so we will ignore this small contribution to the total .",
    "however , we have subtracted the k flux from the older stars from the total to derive the expected starburst output at this wavelength , and it is this corrected value which appears in table  [ tbl : summ ] .",
    "an abundance of kinematic data exists for the nuclear region of .",
    "several rotation curves exist in the literature that have been obtained at radio wavelengths , in molecular emission lines such as co ( e.g. , mauersberger  1996 , canzian  1988 ) or cs ( peng  1996 ) or in hydrogen recombination lines ( anantharamaiah & goss 1996 ) .",
    "while most of these observations have high spectral resolution , they typically have poor spatial resolution and are not always useful for probing the dynamics very close to the nucleus .",
    "the data of anantharamaiah & goss are an exception  their data have a spatial scale similar to ours and indicate a mass of @xmath78  inside a radius of 5 , comparable to the mass we derive in the next section .",

    "this model falls short of the observational constraints , despite our conservatism in setting them .",
    "the model also makes the uncomfortable prediction that the star formation efficiency is 40 - 75% , assuming the mass not used to make stars is still in the form of molecular gas .",
    "we also attempted to model the starburst using an imf more biased towards the formation of massive stars .",
    "such a model produces much more luminosity for a given mass and should do a better job of fitting the observations of  while remaining within the mass constraint .",

    "the hatched region indicates the space in the ( mass , age ) plane that can be occupied by the model while still matching the observations . in this case , the primary constraints are the lower limits on the supernova rate and the uv flux and the upper limits on the k - band luminosity and the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the model falls a little short of meeting the constraints at @xmath110  a better fit occurs at 6 million years after the peak of star formation , using a mass of @xmath111  .",
    "however , the figure illustrates that no single burst model approaches the x - ray timing constraint ( at @xmath112  myr , 8  myr after the peak of star formation ) .",
    "we next explored the effect of varying the star formation history by adding a second burst .",
    "we have parameterized this second burst by a time delay ( @xmath113 t ) after the initial burst and a fraction ( f ) of the mass consumed by both bursts that goes into the second burst , so that f  =  0.5 implies identical masses for both bursts .",
    "although the additional parameters introduced by a two - burst model can help fit many constraints , they invariably require increased mass ( rlrt93 ) .",
    "consequently , since the imf3 model already used a lot of mass , we have not computed double burst models for it . in figure",
    "[ fig : models ] we display a model with two imf8 bursts of equal strength , separated by 25 million years . since we have diluted the mass available by putting it into two widely - separated bursts , this model requires a total mass of @xmath114  .",
    "the model achieves a good fit at a time of 34.5 million years .",
    "the two main advantages of this double - burst model are that there is adequate time for expansion of the x - ray superwind and that the supernova rate is in reasonable agreement with the target value .",
    "models with shorter time intervals between bursts predict supernova rates below the target value .",
    "although for convenience in modeling , we have used two separated bursts in this model , similar results would be obtained with other time dependencies for the star formation rate , so long as : 1 . ) a substantial portion of stars formed about 30 million years ago , so they can produce supernovae without ionizing flux ; and 2 . )",
    "the star formation rate has decayed rapidly for the last roughly 5 million years , so the correct ionizing flux can be produced without an excess of very hot stars .",
    "these three models only meet the temperature constraint with difficulty - if we reduce the allowed fraction of ionizing photons emitted by stars hotter than 40000  k from 15% to 10% , significantly more mass is required .",
    "the temperature constraint is satisfied trivially if we arbitrarily impose an upper - mass cutoff on the models .",
    "this explanation is unlikely , however , since observations of very young star formation regions always indicate that very massive stars are formed ( e.g. , conti , leitherer , & vacca 1996 ; leitherer  1996 ) . extending the duration of the burst of star formation , as in the model we present in the last panel ,",
    "only aggravates the temperature problem , as a larger fraction of the ionizing flux is produced by recently - formed massive stars .",
    "it might be thought that the dusty environments of starbursts would absorb hard uv photons and soften the ionizing spectrum .",
    "however , the absorption properties of dust are believed to _ harden _ the uv ionizing spectra ( aannestad 1989 ; shields & kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of extreme oxygen over abundance is a strong constraint on the shape of starburst imfs at the highest masses ( rltrt93 ) .",
    "the evidence from x - ray spectra that the oxygen may be underabundant relative to solar in  ( and m  82 ) ( ptak  1997 ) therefore may add a difficult constraint to the models , unless the amount of oxygen returned to the ism is lower than expected .",
    "although the case is not as definitive as in extreme galaxies like m  82 ( rlrt93 ) and ngc 1614 ( shier , rieke , & rieke 1996 ) , appears to be another example of a starburst that can not be modelled easily with a `` local '' imf such as that of scalo ( 1986 ) .",
    "imf8 was adopted for m  82 after consideration of a broad range of alternatives , and appears to be a satisfactory solution to this problem for also .",
    "the presence of a starburst imf biased toward high mass stars continues to be controversial ( e.g. , satyapal  1997 ) . however , many studies have fitted starburst observations with a `` salpeter '' imf , with a slope of -1.35 but with a turnover at low masses to satisfy observations of the local stellar population ( e.g. , conti , leitherer , & vacca 1996 ; satyapal  1997 ) .",
    "this imf is virtually identical in observable properties to imf8 and differs just as strongly from the imf of scalo ( 1986 ) !",
    "for example , if the `` salpeter '' imf adopted by satyapal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is normalized to imf8 through the requirement that the stellar populations have equal total mass , the two imfs are the same in the critical 15 - 30 m@xmath115 region except for a small difference in slope .",
    "the `` salpeter '' imf predicts a larger number of very massive stars than does imf8 , and would exacerbate the problem with oxygen abundance .",
    "there are substantial difficulties in determining the local imf , and the imf above @xmath116  in other environments shows substantial variations either from intrinsic differences or interpretive errors ( scalo 1998 ) .",
    "the debate about biased imfs in starbursts is therefore no longer very relevant .",
    "the most interesting development is how all investigators of starburst galaxies have converged on an imf very similar to imf8 of rlrt93 .",
    "a striking feature of the images in figure  [ fig : bbimages ] is the bright , elongated feature centered on the nucleus and oriented roughly east - west .",
    "this feature was first noted by scoville  ( 1985 ) , who describe it as a bar ; pompea & rieke ( 1990 ) found that it curves as it approaches the nucleus and suggested it might instead be inner spiral arms .",
    "our deep infrared images indicate that this apparent curvature arises from a zone of strong extinction . our dereddened k - band image presented in figure  [ fig : deproj ]",

    "the ring is also apparent in the deep h - band image from forbes & depoy ( 1992 ) , although they do not discuss it .",

    "thus , the configuration of molecular gas in the nucleus of  approximates the theoretical predictions that mutual torques between stellar and gas bars will allow the gas to lose angular momentum and sink into the nucleus , where it concentrates until instabilities set in that trigger a starburst .      in figure",
    "[ fig : pv ] we present position - velocity diagrams of some strong emission lines in .",

    "the 2  emission is distributed over a broader region still ( @xmath119  pc ) .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the starburst originally being fairly uniformly distributed around the nucleus , as indicated by the supernovae traced by 2 , but now being active primarily on the nucleus and to the northeast .",
    "they also indicate that the 2 emission is partially excited by a mechanism that extends outside the other starburst indicators , e.g. , molecular cloud collisions .",
    "the excitation mechanism of 2  in starburst galaxies is under debate .",
    "the strong uv flux should excite a significant amount of 2 . however , many of these galaxies display strong emission in the ( 1,0)s(1 ) line ( e.g. , goldader  1996 ) but not in other 2  lines , suggesting that collisional processes rather than fluorescent ones dominate ( c.f . , black & van dishoeck 1987 ) .",
    "one reason that uv - excited 2  is so difficult to detect is that its energy is emitted in a huge number of lines , whereas thermally excited 2  emits most of its luminosity in just a few . in low density gas ,",
    "fluorescent 2  emits just 1.6% of its infrared luminosity in the readily observed ( 1,0)s(1 ) line while thermally excited 2  emits 9% of its infrared luminosity in this line . despite the difficulties associated with detecting a number of very weak lines , fluorescent",

    "that is , the strength is also consistent with an origin predominantly in the same supernova remnants that produce the 2 , with additional h recombination emission from hii regions .",
    "the influence of supernovae on the observed emission line spectrum of  can be determined more quantitatively .",
    "we have determined an average supernova emission line spectrum by averaging the line strengths ( normalized to h@xmath134 ) for 32 supernova remnants measured by danziger & leibowitz ( 1985 ) , fesen , blair & kirshner ( 1985 ) , and blair & kirshner ( 1985 ) .",
    "similarly , an average ratio of 21.64@xmath68m/  can be determined for supernovae measured by oliva , moorwood & danziger ( 1989 ; 1990 ) .",
    "taking h@xmath134/   @xmath135 from case b , we find that /2  @xmath136 .",
    "relating these values through the h recombination lines is an essential step because of the differing geometries in the available optical and near infrared spectra . nonetheless , because of the relatively small amount of infrared data , the derived ratio is somewhat uncertain .",

    "standard nebular calculations for the relative strengths of photoionized lines in the optical ( we have used the work of shields & kennicutt ( 1995 ) , which includes the effects of dust in metal - rich hii regions ) .",
    "we assume a stellar temperature of 38,000  k ( the lowest for which shields & kennicutt give calculations ) and solar metallicity .",
    "we also use the /h@xmath134 ratio for the orion nebula to represent a typical hii region .",
    "the results of these predictions are summarized in table  [ tbl : nebular ] .",
    "the agreement between predicted and observed line ratios is well within the uncertainties . about 85% of the  and half of the",
    "are excited in the supernovae remnants , whereas most of the [ ] , [ ] , and h recombination are excited by photoionization .",
    "although the photoionized portion of the  will decrease rapidly with decreasing stellar temperature , the large portion of shock - excited  will maintain good agreement with the observations .",
    "if the intrinsic /2  ratio is a factor of 1.5 higher than we have used ( which is within our guess of the errors ) , the agreement between predictions and observations is improved and the /h@xmath72 ratio becomes almost independent of a decreased stellar temperature .",
    "thus , a combination of a metal - rich hii region photoionization model with the shocked optical line strengths predicted by assuming the 2  is produced by supernovae provides a satisfactory fit to all the liner - like characteristics of .",
    "this fit involves no free parameters , other than those determined independently of the liner characteristics .",
    "the filippenko & terlevich ( 1992 ) hot star photoionization model would predict that liners appear as a very early stage in a starburst .",
    "instead , we suggest that the liner characteristics emerge after the stars emitting most vigorously in the uv have died , so the hii region characteristics will fade sufficiently to reveal the supernova shock excitation .",
    "the decay time for ionizing flux in a starburst is only a few million years , whereas the supernova rate is maintained for about 30 million years .",
    "therefore , if the star - forming episodes in starbursts are typically short in duration , of order 20 million years , then there should be a significant population of objects in the transitional stage that produces liner characteristics . in agreement with this conclusion , we found in  [ sec : n253-models ] that starburst models with these characteristics give the best overall fit to the properties of .",

    "we have used these data and data from the literature to perform a detailed study of the interstellar medium and nuclear starburst in .",

    ") roughly two thirds of the infrared 2  luminosity is due to uv fluorescence .",
    "it is likely that significant fluorescent - excited components of 2  emission in other starburst galaxies have been missed because the distribution of emission over many relatively faint lines makes detection difficult in spectra of modest resolution and signal to noise .",

    "the line ratios can also be fitted by a combination of a photoionization model for metal rich hii regions excited by stars of @xmath1 38,000k , and the shock excited spectrum of supernova explosions occurring at the rate measured in the starburst .",

    "imf3 , which was assembled by rlrt93 to represent various representations of the local imf , is not satisfactory although it can not be ruled out as absolutely as for extreme galaxies like m  82 and ngc 1614 .",
    "imf8 is very similar to the modified salpeter imf that other workers have recently found gives a good fit in starburst galaxy models . due to the large variations or uncertainties in imfs above 1  ,",
    "it is no longer clear whether imf3 is a meaningful representation of the local stellar population to be compared with those in starbursts .",
    "the model giving the best fit assumes that the star formation is extended over 20 to 30 million years .",
    "a portion of the supernovae is associated with stars formed near the beginning of the burst , while the ionizing flux arises from the most recently formed stars .",
    "the rate of star formation must have declined rapidly during the last roughly 5 million years , to account for the absence of very hot stars .",

    "<S> we have obtained long - slit spectra of  in the j , h , k , and n bands , broadband images in the j , h , and k@xmath0 bands , narrowband images centered at the wavelengths of  and 2(1,0)s(1 ) , and imaging spectroscopy centered on 2(12.8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have subtracted a composite stellar spectrum from the galaxy spectrum to measure faint emission lines which otherwise would be buried in the complicated continuum structure .    </S>",
    "<S> we use these data and data from the literature in a comprehensive re - assessment of the starburst in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the 2  emission is predominantly excited by supernova explosions and show that the rate of these events can be derived from the strength of the infrared 2  lines . </S>",
    "<S> although the 2  emission superficially resembles a thermally excited spectrum , most of the 2  infrared luminosity is excited by fluorescence in low density gas . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the presence of a bar and also show that this galaxy has a circumnuclear ring . </S>",
    "<S> the relation of these features to the gaseous bar seen in co is in agreement with the general theoretical picture of how gas can be concentrated into galaxy centers by bars . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a strong upper limit of @xmath1 37,000k for the stars exciting the emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> we use velocity - resolved infrared spectra to determine the mass in the starburst region . </S>",
    "<S> most of this mass appears to be locked up in the old , pre - existing stellar population . using these constraints and others to build an evolutionary synthesis model , we find that the imf originally derived to fit the starburst in m  82 also accounts for the properties of ; this imf is similar to a modified salpeter imf . </S>",
    "<S> the models indicate that rapid massive star formation has been ongoing for 20 - 30 million years in that is , it is in a late phase of its starburst . </S>",
    "<S> its optical spectrum has characteristics of a transitional hii / weak-  liner . </S>",
    "<S> we model the emission line spectrum expected from a late phase starburst and demonstrate that it reproduces these characteristics .    </S>",
