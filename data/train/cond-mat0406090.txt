    "the effect of these pulses is additional field fluctuation which adds to the decoherence rate and makes qubit control impossible .",

    "the rate for controlling spectral diffusion is _ significantly faster _ than dipole - dipole coupling because hyperfine coupling ( absent from the second moment equation ) is very strong ( up to mhz ) and the spectral diffusion decay occurs due to the collective fluctuation of several nuclei under the field of the electron .",
    "we emphasize that the relative time scale for cpmg control of spectral diffusion and its dependence on the nuclear spin value @xmath17 that we have established here can only be derived by carefully considering the combined effect of hyperfine interaction and collective dipolar fluctuation of @xmath212 nuclear spins under the inhomogeneous hyperfine field produced by the electron , as we have done in this paper .",
