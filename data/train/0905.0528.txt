    "the @xmath4-matrix element of partial wave elastic scattering amplitude satisfies the following dispersive representation :  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11-th @xmath12 sheet pole contribution and @xmath13 denotes the contribution from cuts except the elastic one .",
    "the information from higher sheet poles is hidden in the right hand integral which consists of one part of the total background contribution .",
    "we have , @xmath14 where the ` left hand ' cut @xmath15 $ ] for equal mass scatterings and may contain a rather complicated structure for unequal mass scatterings .",
    "the right hand cut @xmath16 starts from first _",
    "inelastic _ threshold to positive infinity .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the dispersive representation for @xmath17 is free from the subtraction constant .",
    "@xcite the pku representation , eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) , is sensitive to @xmath4 matrix poles not too far away from physical threshold , hence providing a useful tool to explore the light and broad resonance @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the data",
    "fit it is found that crossing symmetry plays an important role in fixing the @xmath18 pole location .",
    "taking this fact into account  @xcite it gives the @xmath18 pole location at @xmath20 in good agreement with the determination using more sophisticated roy equation analysis .",

    "( [ separable ] ) to lass data  @xcite also unambiguously establish the existence of the @xmath19 meson with the pole location :  @xcite @xmath21 which are also in agreement with the later determination on @xmath19 pole parameters using roy  steiner equations .",
    "@xcite    the dispersion representation eq .",
    "( [ pku ] ) safely embeds chiral perturbative amplitudes into a unitarized scheme .",
    "this property is not always trivial in the practice of unitarization .",
    "for example , contrary to the input chiral perturbative amplitudes , pad approximants lead to completely different singularity structure in the vicinity of @xmath22  a region where the former ought to be trustworthy .",
    "the reliability of @xmath5pt predictions in the small @xmath23 region can be vividly seen in the i=2 @xmath24 wave amplitude .",
    "one may use @xmath5pt result to estimate the contribution of the left hand cut to the scattering length @xmath25 .",
    "the estimate is rough but gives a value qualitatively much larger in magnitude than @xmath25 extracted from experiment .",
    "this difficulty is resolved , recalling that @xmath5pt also predicts a virtual pole near @xmath22 , which contribution cancels a large amount of the cut contribution and leads to the correct prediction of @xmath25 .",
    "this example further illustrate that the singularity structure as predict by @xmath5pt in the vicinity of @xmath22 is indeed reliable and self - consistent .    the pku representation , eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) affords another interesting opportunity to study the relation between resonance parameters and low energy constants of the chiral lagrangian . on the @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) one may replace @xmath27 by @xmath5pt result at low energies , on the @xmath28 one does not know how many resonances are there , nevertheless one may formally make a threshold expansion to match the @xmath26 .",
    "in this situation the cut integrals in eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) are however difficult to calculate .",
    "so we firstly neglect completely the cut integrals and assuming there is only one pole on the @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) . under this approximation",
    "we can get a prediction on the resonance parameters expressed in terms of the low energy constants .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pole location is exactly the same as the prediction of [ 1,1 ] pad amplitude in the large @xmath29 and chiral limit . in my knowledge there",
    "had never been serious examination on what does the predictions of pad approximation mean in the literature . hence ref .",
    "@xcite provides a first understanding on this question : in the large @xmath29 and chiral limit the pole location as predicted by [ 1,1 ] pad approximant is equivalent to the approximation that : 1 ) neglecting crossed channel cut completely , 2 ) assuming single pole dominance in the @xmath24 channel .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that crossed channel cut contributions are _ not _ negligible .",
    "a direct consequence of neglecting the cut contribution is the violation of crossing symmetry as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "threshold expansion on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) ( the @xmath26 replaced by @xmath30 ) could provide useful relations between resonance parameters and low energy constants , if one can reliably estimate cut integrals in some way . fortunately , this can indeed be done in the large @xmath29 limit .",
    "in such a limit the eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) leads to the same result as the partial wave dispersion relation . hence eq .",

    "@xcite nevertheless due to its strong interaction nature , it is very difficult to solve this problem at fundamental level . on the other side",
    ", it is argued using the inverse amplitude method or chiral unitarization approach , that the @xmath60 pole is a ` dynamically generated ' resonance .",
    "@xcite yet the wording ` dynamically generated ' itself needs clarification ,  @xcite it can be understood from the discussion in section  [ pku ] and refs .",
    "@xcite that in the approach of unitarization of chiral perturbative amplitudes the @xmath60 pole does fall back to the real axis in the large @xmath29 limit .",
    "hence one has to put it explicitly in the lagrangian in the very beginning , therefore being ` fundamental ' .",

    "@xcite one may expect that the study of other light scalar resonances like @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 could shed some light on the understanding of @xmath60 .",
    "however , the inclusion of these resonances does not seem to be very helpful up to now , if not merely making the situation more complicated .",
    "there remains the hope in understanding better the property of @xmath60 through the study on the @xmath66 process , as emphasized by pennington ,  @xcite since the di - photon coupling of a resonance may be used as probe to investigate hadron internal structure at quark level .",
    "again unitarity plays a crucial role in such investigations .",
    "however the @xmath18 pole locates quite far away from the physical region , the di - photon coupling extracted as such is found not very stable .",
    "this problem is reinvestigated recently ,  @xcite where the fit to data at first step is up to 1.4gev , aiming at fixing the @xmath67-wave background .",
    "then a refined analysis is made by fitting data up to 0.8gev , using the @xmath3 scattering @xmath68 matrix obtained in ref .",

    "this further stresses the unconventional nature of the @xmath60 nature except the large width it has . the value of @xmath72 coupling is also given in ref .",
