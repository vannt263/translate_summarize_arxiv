    "the exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons has been investigated recently both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . in particular , the light vector mesons as @xmath5 and @xmath4 have not a perturbative scale associated to the process in photoproduction limit and so they test the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the transition between the perturbative hard treatment and the soft regime can be addressed by the so - called saturation approaches @xcite within the color dipole formalism @xcite . in those formalisms",
    "a saturation scale characterizes the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction . in such framework ,",
    "the typical scale driven the dynamics of light meson production is the saturation scale and the photons can be considered as color dipoles in the mixed light cone representation , where their transverse size can be considered frozen during the interaction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scattering process is characterized by the color dipole cross section describing the interaction of those color dipoles with the nucleon or nucleus targets .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath6 fluctuations , i.e. the color dipoles , of the incoming quasi - real photon interacts with the target via the dipole cross section and the result is projected in the wavefunctionof the observed hadron . at high energies , i.e. small-@xmath7 region ,",
    "it is expected a transition between the regime described by the linear dynamics of emissions chain and a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons turn out to be crucial .",
    "the transition is driven by the saturation scale @xmath8 , which is typically enhanced in the scattering on nuclei targets @xcite .",
    "the approach shortly described above has done a good job in describing the vector meson photo and electroproduction at the desy - hera energy regime considering a proton target ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "the possibility for investigation of the photo - nuclear production in similar energies was provided by the rhic measurements on @xmath5 and @xmath9 production considering the coherent gold - gold heavy ion collisions @xcite . for a long time",
    "has been proposed the analysis of coherent collisions in hadronic interactions as an alternative way to investigate the qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in coherent hadronic collisions is that the cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities achieved at rhic and lhc .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath10 or @xmath11 interactions at the lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the main point here is to investigate the robustness of the phenomenological models including the saturation phenomenon which have their parameters fixed by desy - hera data when extrapolated to the very high energy regime reached at the lhc .",
    "our goal in this work is to analyze the theoretical uncertainties on the predictions for the photoproduction of light vector mesons in coherent @xmath0 , pbpb and @xmath12pb collisions at the lhc using the color dipole approach .",
    "predictions for the rapidity distribution for @xmath3 and @xmath4 photoproduction will be furnished and an analysis on the uncertainties associated to the choice of vector meson wavefunctionand the phenomenological models for the dipole cross section is performed .",
    "moreover , we will present our predictions for the rapidity dependence of @xmath5 cross sections at lhc energy of 2.76 tev in coherent pbpb collisions , which is currently under analysis by the alice collaboration @xcite .",

    "the photon - pomeron interaction will be described within the light - cone dipole frame , where the probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair with transverse separation @xmath21 ( and momentum fraction @xmath22 ) long after the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron .",
