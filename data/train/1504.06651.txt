    "perhaps the most intriguing open question about venn diagrams is that of winkler @xcite : is every simple @xmath0-venn diagram _",
    "extendible _ to a simple @xmath2-venn diagram by the addition of a suitable curve ?",
    "winkler conjectured (  nervously \" ) that the answer is yes .",
    "an @xmath0-venn diagram is a collection of such curves with the further properties that the collection partitions the plane into @xmath3 connected non - empty regions , each region being formed by one of the @xmath3 possible intersections of the interior or exterior of each curve .",
    "simple venn diagram _ is one in which there are a finite number of intersection points and at most two curves pass through any given point . in this paper",
    "we will assume that all venn diagrams are simple .",
    "the figure below shows a @xmath4-venn diagram on the right .",
    "a venn diagram can be regarded as a planar graph in which the vertices are the points of intersection and edges are the segments of the curves between the vertices ; we call such a graph a _ venn graph_. the venn graph corresponding to the venn diagram to the right is shown on the left in the figure above .    in the venn graph context , winkler s question is equivalent to asking whether the planar dual of every simple venn diagram is hamiltonian .",
    "a hamilton cycle in the dual becomes the new curve .",
    "it is also natural to ask whether every venn graph is hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we introduce a much wider class of configurations of simple closed curves in the plane and prove that the graphs that arise from these configurations have connectivity of four .",
    "a theorem of tutte @xcite then implies that they , and hence venn graphs , are hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is concerned with collections of simple closed curves in the plane .",
    "as is well known , any simple closed curve partitions the plane into the curve itself , the _ interior _ of the curve , and the _ exterior _ of the curve .",
    "we will assume that the curves lie in _ general position _",
    ", meaning that they intersect at some finite number of points , at most two curves intersect at any point , and that each intersection is transverse ; that is , the curves cross each other when they intersect , no  kissing \" allowed .",
    "2-face _ in an embedding of closed curves is a face that is incident to exactly two curves .    with any collection of closed curves in general position",
    ", there is a natural way to associate a 4-regular plane graph whose vertices are the points of intersection and whose edges are the curve segments between the points of intersection . for a vertex @xmath5 on a curve @xmath6 , we may refer to @xmath5 s `` @xmath6 neighbours '' , meaning those two neighbours of @xmath5 that are also on @xmath6 .",
    "observe that the curves can be recovered from the graph since the intersections are transverse .",
    "in general it is difficult to determine if the graph is hamiltonian since iwamoto and toussaint have shown that the problem is np - complete @xcite .    in the case where the venn diagrams are not required to be simple ,",
    "chilakamarri , hamburger , and pippert @xcite showed them all to be extendible to a non - simple venn diagram .",
    "these same authors @xcite also showed that the venn graph is always 3-connected and similarly the venn dual is always 3-connected ( if there are more than 2 curves ) .",
    "we strengthen this result by showing that the connectivity of a venn graph is precisely 4 .",
    "bultena @xcite verified that winkler s conjecture is true for all venn diagrams with 5 or fewer curves .",
    "two notable properties of simple @xmath0-venn graphs for @xmath7 are the following : ( a ) there are no 2-faces ; ( b ) a curve is incident on a face at most once .",
    "in fact , for a general connected collection of curves , ( b ) implies ( a ) if @xmath7 ( draw a picture to convince yourself )",
    ". we will call property ( b ) the _ ufi _ property , an acronym for unique face incidence property .    a _",
    "v - graph _ is the graph of a collection of at least three topologically connected curves in the plane , lying in general position , and which satisfies the ufi property .",
    "our aim is to prove that every v - graph is 4-connected and then invoke a theorem of tutte @xcite to infer that v - graphs are hamiltonian .",
    "any 4-connected planar graph is hamiltonian .",
    "we make use of menger s characterization of @xmath8-connectivity : a graph is @xmath8-connected if and only if between every pair of distinct vertices there are at least @xmath8 disjoint paths .",
    "( disjoint here means that they have no intermediate vertices in common , although they share endpoints . )",
    "[ lemma : k - conn ] a connected graph is @xmath8-connected if and only if for all pairs of vertices @xmath9 at distance two from one another , there exist @xmath8 vertex - disjoint @xmath9-paths .",
    "* proof : * the  only if \" direction is obvious , so we consider the claim in the  if \" direction .",
    "suppose @xmath10 is graph , and all pairs of vertices at distance two in @xmath10 are connected by @xmath8 disjoint paths .",
    "let @xmath11 be a cut of minimum size in @xmath10 , and let @xmath12 be a vertex in @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath13 is connected , but the further removal of @xmath12 does disconnect the graph . therefore @xmath12 has a neighbour in each connected component of @xmath14 ; let @xmath15 and @xmath5 be two such neighbours in different components .",
    "hence @xmath15 and @xmath5 are at distance two from one another in @xmath10 , and so have at least @xmath8 disjoint paths between them .",
    "each of these disjoint paths contains at least one member of @xmath11 , so @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17    the connectivity of a v - graph is four .",
    "[ thm : vconn4 ]    * proof : * since a v - graph is 4-regular the connectivity can not be higher than four .",
    "we will show that the connectivity is at least 4 by using lemma [ lemma : k - conn ] .",
    "let @xmath10 be a v - graph , and let @xmath15 and @xmath5 be any two vertices at distance two in @xmath10 , with @xmath18 being a vertex that is a neighbour of both @xmath15 and @xmath5 .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    \\(a ) ( b )    vertex @xmath18 is the intersection of exactly two curves , call them red and green . without loss of generality , we consider the two cases , either @xmath15 and @xmath5 are both on the green curve ( case 1 ) , or alternatively , @xmath15 is on the green curve and @xmath5 is on the red curve ( case 2 ) .",
    "we show in either case that there are four disjoint @xmath9-paths in @xmath10 .",
    "* case 1 : * @xmath15 and @xmath5 are on the green curve .",
    "then @xmath18 has two remaining neighbours , call them @xmath19 and @xmath20 , on the red curve . since there are no 2-faces @xmath19 and @xmath20 are distinct from @xmath15 and @xmath5 ( and from each other ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : case1](a ) .",
    "we construct two vertex - disjoint @xmath9-paths in @xmath21 by traversing the edges along the perimeter of the four faces adjacent to @xmath18 : the @xmath22 path on one side of the green curve , and the @xmath23 path on the other side of the green curve . since these paths are on different sides of the green curve they are therefore vertex disjoint from each other , except in the endpoints .",
    "furthermore , by the ufi property , none of the edges on those paths are green , nor are any of the intermediate vertices incident to a green edge",
    ". therefore , there are two @xmath9-paths that are disjoint from those outlined above : the two paths constructed from the cycle of green edges .",
    "one path is @xmath24 and the other consists of the remaining edges along the green curve .",
    "see figure [ fig : case1](b ) .",
    "* case 2 : * @xmath15 is on the green curve and @xmath5 is on the red curve .",
    "let @xmath19 be @xmath18 s other red neighbour , and let @xmath20 be @xmath18 s other green neighbour .",
    "since there are no 2-faces , all four of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath15 , @xmath5 are distinct .",
    "see figure [ fig : case2](a ) .",
    "we construct two vertex - disjoint @xmath9-paths in @xmath21 by traversing the edges along the perimeter of the four faces adjacent to @xmath18 .",
    "call this perimeter the _",
    "@xmath18-face _ in @xmath21 .",
    "note , as before , that none of those edges is red or green .",
    "_ path a : _ use the non - red / green edges in the face of @xmath10 containing @xmath15 and @xmath5 . denote this path @xmath25 .",
    "_ path b : _ use the remaining edges in the @xmath18-face : @xmath26 .",
    "these two paths are vertex - disjoint except in their endpoints , as each non-@xmath9 vertex on path a is separated from any non-@xmath9 vertex on path b by either the red curve or the green curve or both .",
    "_ path c : _ follow the green curve from @xmath15 in the direction away from @xmath18 . since the green and red curves intersect at @xmath18 they must intersect again ; follow the green curve until the last red - green intersection . then follow the red curve towards @xmath18 until it hits @xmath5 .",
    "_ path d : _ use the two edge path @xmath24 .",
    "paths c and d are disjoint , as they contain disjoint parts of the green and red curves .",
    "they are disjoint from paths a and b as they visit only vertices on the green and red curves , while avoiding vertices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 .    in either of cases 1 or 2 above , there are four vertex - disjoint paths connecting @xmath15 and @xmath5 , an arbitrary pair of vertices at distance two from each other in @xmath10 . by lemma 1",
    ", this suffices to prove that @xmath10 is 4-connected .",
    "@xmath27    all v - graphs are hamiltonian .",
    "* proof : * from theorem [ thm : vconn4 ] , above , we have that v - graph is 4-connected ; and by definition , v - graphs are planar . by tutte s theorem ,",
    "every 4-connected planar graph is hamiltonian .",
    "therefore every v - graph is hamiltonian .",
    "since v - graphs generalize venn graphs we have the following :    the connectivity of a venn graph is four .",
    "furthermore , every venn graph is hamiltonian .",
    "the question of hamiltonicity remains open if the assumption that the venn diagrams are simple is lifted .",
    "we know of no non - simple venn diagrams that are not hamiltonian .",
    "thus in the spirit of winkler s conjecture , we ( nervously ) make the following conjecture .",
    "all non - simple venn diagrams are hamiltonian .",
    "algorithmically , it is worth noting that there is a linear time algorithm for finding a hamilton cycle in a 4-connected graph ; see chiba and nishizeki @xcite . since the problem of determining whether a collection of jordan curves in the plane in general position is hamiltonian is np - complete @xcite , it is interesting that the ufi property is enough to guarantee hamiltonicity .",
    "an easy example of a collection of curves that does not satisfy the ufi property and which are only biconnected is obtained by having two curves  weave \" back - and - forth across each other .",
    "such configurations have 2-faces .",
    "figure 7(c ) on page 186 in @xcite shows an example of a non - hamiltonian 3-connected configuration of curves in general position that is without 2-faces .",
