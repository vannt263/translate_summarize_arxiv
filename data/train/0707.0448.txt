    "the measurement of the strong - interaction energy - level shift and width of kaonic atom x - rays offers a unique possibility to precisely determine the @xmath1-nucleus strong interaction in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore many experiments have been performed to collect data on a variety of targets from hydrogen to uranium .",
    "it has been known that most of the available kaonic - atom data can be fitted fairly well for @xmath3 by optical - potential models @xcite with the exception of kaonic helium and oxygen .",
    "the strong - interaction shift of the @xmath4 level @xmath5 for kaonic @xmath0he has been previously measured in three experiments .",
    "note that @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy of the level with principal quantum number @xmath8 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the energy calculated using only the electromagnetic interaction ( em ) .",
    "the average of the three previous results gives @xmath11 ev @xcite , while most of the theoretical calculations give @xmath12 ev @xcite ( _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath13 ev @xcite ) .",
    "they disagree by more than five standard deviations , and this discrepancy is known as the `` kaonic helium puzzle '' .",
    "therefore an accurate re - measurement of the energy shift of the @xmath4 level of kaonic helium has been long awaited .    in the present experiment",
    "we have performed a measurement of the balmer - series x - rays of kaonic @xmath0he atoms , setting as our experimental objective a precision of @xmath14 2 ev , thus shedding new light on the kaonic helium puzzle .",
    "the experiment e570 was carried out at the k5 beamline of the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) .",
    "we accumulated data in two periods  520 hours in october 2005 ( cycle 1 ) and 260 hours in december 2005 ( cycle 2 ) .",
    "the experimental apparatus was essentially the same as that of the former kek - ps e549 experiment @xcite performed at the same beamline , except for the inclusion of x - ray detectors and energy calibration foils in the helium - target cryostat .",
    "a schematic view of the e570 setup around the target is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "the detailed description of the experimental setup is given in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the kaonic @xmath0he atoms were produced by means of the stopped-@xmath15 reaction using a superfluid @xmath0he target ( cylindrical shape 15 cm long and 20 cm in diameter at a density of 0.145 g/@xmath16 ) .",
    "incident negatively - charged kaons with momentum @xmath14650 mev/@xmath17 were degraded in carbon degraders , counted with beamline counters , tracked by a high - rate beamline drift chamber and stopped inside the @xmath0he target .",
    "the energy losses before stopping were measured in a set of scintillation counters , t0 .",
    "x - rays emitted from the kaonic @xmath0he atoms were detected by eight x - ray detectors which viewed the target from downstream through the 75 @xmath18m - thick mylar window of the target vessel .",
    "secondary charged particles produced in the kaon - absorption process following emission of kaonic x - rays were detected by charged - particle trigger / tracking systems placed on the left , right , top and bottom of the target .    in the present experiment ,",
    "a significant improvement over the past experiments was achieved by incorporating the following features :          as x - ray detectors , we employed eight silicon drift detectors ( sdds ) produced by ketek gmbh @xcite , each having an effective area of 100 mm@xmath19 and a 260 @xmath18m - thick active layer with an energy resolution of @xmath14190 ev ( fwhm ) at 6.4 kev , which corresponds to the kaonic - helium @xmath2 x - ray energy .",
    "the temperature of the sdds was kept at @xmath1483 k during the experiment by a connection to the thermal - radiation shield for the helium target cooled by liquid nitrogen .    in the sdd ,",
    "the electrons produced by an x - ray hit drift radially toward the central anode where they are collected .",
    "the small anode size ( and hence small capacitance ) is essential to realize the good energy resolution despite the large effective area .",
    "the energy resolution is about twice as good as that of the si(li ) x - ray detectors used in the previous three experiments .",
    "the time resolution is comparable with that of a si(li ) detector .",
    "the small anode area also makes it possible to reduce the active layer thickness , while the capacitance is still kept small .",
    "the thin active layer of 260 @xmath18 m ( less than 1/10th of the previously used detectors ) helps to reduce continuum background caused by the compton scattering occurring inside the detector .",
    "we required that the reaction vertices reconstructed from an incident kaon track and an outgoing secondary charged particle track should be within the target , which is called the `` fiducial volume cut '' .",
    "moreover , in - flight kaon decay / reaction events were rejected by applying a correlation cut between the @xmath20-coordinate of the reaction vertex and the energy loss in t0 . as a result",
    ", continuum background events were drastically reduced .",
    "the energy calibration was done by using characteristic x - rays induced by charged particles ( @xmath21 , which abundantly existed in the incident beam ) on high - purity titanium and nickel foils placed just behind the target cell .",
    "the energy of the kaonic - helium @xmath2 x - ray , @xmath146.4 kev , lies between the characteristic x - ray energies , 4.5 kev(ti ) and 7.5 kev(ni ) . to obtain high - statistics energy calibration spectra , we accumulated sdd self - triggered events together with the stopped-@xmath15 triggered events , which provide high - accuracy in - situ calibration spectra .    to avoid detecting the background characteristic x - rays from other than the titanium and nickel",
    ", high - purity aluminum foils were placed on all objects in the view of the sdds .",
    "figure  [ fig : t0verz ] shows the correlation between the @xmath20-coordinate of the reaction vertex and the light output of t0 .",
    "each component of the target assembly ( a carbon degrader , a target cell and sdds / foils ) is clearly seen .",
    "we applied a fiducial volume cut of @xmath22 cm on the @xmath20 coordinate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0verz ] , and of @xmath23 cm on the radius from the target center .",
    "slower incident kaons , which give larger light output on t0 , stop upstream in the target , while faster kaons ( hence smaller pulse height ) stop downstream .",

    "time resolution of the sdd after time - walk correction was @xmath14 160 ns ( @xmath24 ) at @xmath1483 k , which reflected the drift - time distribution of the electrons in the sdd .",
    "data within @xmath25 2 standard deviations from the average sdd hit timing were selected .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( a ) shows a typical x - ray spectrum for sdd self - triggered events , which is used for the energy calibration .",
    "characteristic x - ray peaks of titanium and nickel were obtained with high statistics .",
    "typical yields of titanium k@xmath26 peaks are 5 @xmath27 events per hour for each sdd . time - dependent gain drift was corrected about every 20 hours .",
    "the energy scale was calibrated by k@xmath26 lines of titanium and nickel with the well - known energies @xcite and intensity ratios @xcite of k@xmath28 and k@xmath29 .    after applying the event selections described above and calibrating the energy scale , we obtained x - ray energy spectra for stopped-@xmath15 triggered events shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "kaonic - helium @xmath2 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 transitions are clearly observed , while the ti and ni x - ray peaks are greatly suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( b ) and ( c ) respectively show the x - ray spectra taken in the runs in october 2005 ( cycle 1 ) and december 2005 ( cycle 2 ) . in cycle 1 , only 3 out of 8 sdds yielded useful data ; the faulty detectors were then replaced , and 7 sdds were functional in cycle 2 . in total , @xmath32 ( cycle 1 ) and @xmath33 ( cycle 2 ) events of @xmath2 x - rays were accumulated for each cycle .",
    "the total yields are approximately equivalent for both runs since the beam time of the october run was twice that of the december run . in comparison to the most recent measurement of the kaonic @xmath0he spectrum @xcite , we achieved @xmath142 times better energy resolution , @xmath143 times higher statistics , and @xmath146 times better signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "during the course of the present analysis of spectra from sdds , many fine details of the signal and calibration pulses were found necessary to attain ev accuracy and will be discussed extensively in a paper to follow . here",
    ", we briefly summarize the spectral fitting method with a sdd - response function studied in detail , and show the fit results .    for fitting the spectra of kaonic - helium x - ray peaks ,",
    "a convolution of a gaussian ( representing the detector response ) and a lorentz function ( natural width ) , `` voigt function '' , was adopted as the main - peak function , whereas a gaussian response was employed as a main - peak function for fitting the characteristic x - ray peaks since their natural width is much less than the energy resolution of the sdd .",
    "an energy - dependent experimental energy resolution was employed as is usually the case for silicon detectors : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the contribution of noise to the resolution ( independent of the x - ray energy ) , @xmath37 is the x - ray energy , @xmath38 is the fano factor ( @xmath39 0.12 for silicon ) , and @xmath40 is the average energy for electron - hole creation in silicon . here ,",
    "@xmath40 was fixed to be 3.81 ev , and @xmath38 and @xmath36 were introduced as free fit - parameters for the self - triggered - event spectra .",
    "because of the large incoherent ( compton ) total scattering cross section of liquid @xmath0he ( @xmath41 barn / atom at photon energies of @xmath1410 kev ) , a low - energy tail structure due to the compton scattering must be taken into account .",
    "the convolution of an exponential function with a gaussian was adopted as the spectral shape ( called the `` compton tail function '' ) .",
    "all parameters of the compton tail function relative to the main peak were estimated by fitting the simulated x - ray energy spectra smeared with a gaussian resolution function .",
    "the x - ray spectra were simulated with the geant code using the low energy compton scattering ( lecs ) package @xcite with a realistic setup of e570 and the measured stopped-@xmath15 distribution .",
    "we also have waveform data available from flash adcs ( fadcs ) , which were accumulated as well as ordinary comparator - type pulse - height adc data , although the fadc data are available only for about half of cycle 1 . using the waveform analysis ,",
    "it is shown that there is a non - negligible pileup effect due to the high - rate beam condition of e570 . the spectral function attributed to the pileup events",
    "could be estimated as a gaussian on the right flank of the main - peak function ( called the `` pileup gaussian '' ) .",
    "the mean and sigma parameters of the pileup gaussian were estimated using fadc data .",
    "there are many empirical investigations of the response function of silicon detectors using monoenergetic x - rays ( @xmath42 @xcite ) , and it is known that there is an exponential - like feature decreasing steeply in intensity towards lower energy on the left flank of the main - peak function ( called the `` tail function '' ) and a flat shelf - like feature which extends to near zero energy ( called the `` shelf function '' ) @xcite , due to electron transport processes and imperfections in the fabrication processes .",
    "these effects were also taken into account in the spectral fitting separately from the compton tailing effect in the liquid @xmath0he target mentioned above .",
    "the intensity ratios of these components ( pileup gaussian , tail and shelf functions ) to the main - peak component were estimated by fitting the high - statistics x - ray spectra for self - triggered events .",
    "the estimated intensity ratios were then fixed in the fits of the x - ray spectra for stopped-@xmath15 triggered events .",
    "resulting fit - lines are overlaid on the x - ray spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ( b ) and ( c ) with each contribution : main voigtian , compton tail function , pileup gaussian , tail function and shelf function .",
    "the fit residuals are also shown under each spectrum , with thin lines denoting the @xmath34 values of the data , where @xmath24 is the standard deviation due to the counting statistics . in the fits , the intensity and mean parameters for each kaonic helium x - ray transition are independent . as a result ,",
    "the kaonic @xmath0he x - ray energy of the @xmath2 transition was determined to be @xmath43 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "the quoted systematic error is a linear summation of the contributions from the intensity ambiguities of the compton tail , pileup , shelf and tail functions for kaonic - helium x - rays .",

    "these values are consistent with another recent calculation @xcite and differ slightly from the ones used in previous experiments @xcite .",
