    "we assume initially @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 so that @xmath95 and @xmath96 . while @xmath46 is much larger than unity , the rapid expansion of @xmath60 due to the large potential proportional to @xmath97 drives @xmath46 in feedback to drop very quickly to a small value of order one .",

    "the equation ( [ beq - osc ] ) gives the relation @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the oscillating @xmath3 field has the property @xmath104 and behaves like homogeneous and isotropic matter .",

    "these solutions are the solutions to the eqs .",
    "( [ eq - b])([eq - a3 ] ) for the specific initial conditions .",
    "however , the importance of these solutions , as noted in the paragraph above , arises from the fact that they are attractors , which means that after enough time the solutions with different initial conditions approach these solutions .",
    "we will confirm this through numerical analysis in the next subsection .",
    "the solution ( [ sol-1 ] ) applies for the brane tension dominated case where the dilaton potential is approximated by @xmath124 .",

    "when @xmath46 vanishes , the transition point at which @xmath129 starts to dominate over @xmath130 is at @xmath131 .",
    "thus , this solution describes the late time behavior of all the solutions with various initial conditions when @xmath4 is positive .",
    "it is very intriguing since we achieve the isotropic universe in the end .",
    "the anisotropy is the result of the non - vanishing @xmath3 field , whose coupling is dictated by the brane tension term .",

    "the rolling of the dilaton under the potential @xmath129 now forms the matter having the equation of state @xmath132 , thus giving marginal inflation .",
    "we have the second order differential equations for four variables @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",

    "@xmath146 must obey the constraint equation ( [ eq - constraint ] ) , but this does not fix the ratio @xmath147 .",
    "we choose the isotropic universe as a natural initial condition which leads to @xmath91 .",
    "since the dilaton potential is composed of exponential terms , the shift of the dilaton field by a constant can be traded for the redefinition of mass scale .",
    "we use this property to take the initial value of the dilaton to be zero without loss of generality . in our numerical analysis , we take the dimensionless time variable as @xmath148 where @xmath149 and use the variable @xmath150 with its initial value @xmath151 .",
    "this means that the proper time scale for the cosmological evolution is not @xmath152 , but @xmath153 . for convenience s sake",
    ", we take the initial time as @xmath154 .",
    "the other mass scale @xmath4 is also affected by this shift and we can treat it by replacing the parameter @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",

    "<S> the d - brane world is an idea that we are living on the d - brane imbedded in a 10- or 11-dimensional spacetime of string theories , aiming at the construction of realistic models from string theories . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the cosmological aspects of the d - brane world , focusing on homogeneous anisotropic cosmology driven by the dilaton and the ns - ns 2-form field which becomes massive in the presence of the d - brane . </S>",
    "<S> the dilaton possesses the potential due to the presence of the d - brane , various form field fluxes , and the curvature of extra dimensions . in the absence of stabilizing potential </S>",
    "<S> , we found the attractor solutions for this system which show the overall features of general solutions . in the presence of the non - vanishing ns - ns 2-form field , </S>",
    "<S> the homogeneous universe expands anisotropically while the d - brane term dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropy is recovered as the dilaton rolls down and the curvature term dominates . with the stabilizing potential for the dilaton , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy developed by the initial ns - ns 2-form field flux is erased as the ns - ns 2-form field begins to oscillate around the minimum , forming the b - matter , and the isotropic matter - dominated universe is obtained . </S>"
