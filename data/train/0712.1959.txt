    "the importance of computing delaunay triangulations of point sets in applications of science and engineering can not be overemphasized .",
    "a number of different algorithms have been proposed for their computations  @xcite . among them",
    "flip based algorithms are most popular and perhaps the most dominant approach in practice .",
    "the sheer elegance and simplicity of this approach make it attractive to implement .",
    "since the introduction of delaunay flips by lawson  @xcite for point sets in two dimensions , several important extensions have been made including higher dimensional point sets .",
    "given any triangulation of the convex hull of a point set in two dimensions , it is known that delaunay edge flips can convert the triangulation to the delaunay triangulation .",
    "the rule for delaunay edge flips is simple .",
    "first , check locally if the circumscribing ball of a triangle @xmath0 contains a vertex of another triangle @xmath1 sharing an edge @xmath2 with it .",
    "if so , replace @xmath2 with the other diagonal edge contained in the union of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "an elegant result is that this process terminates with the output as the delaunay triangulation  @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    ", the edge flips can be naturally extended to bi - stellar flips  @xcite .",
    "however , the approach extended by bi - stellar flips does not work in higher dimensions .",
    "already in three dimensions there are examples where the flipping process can get stuck  @xcite . notwithstanding this negative result , joe  @xcite showed how to construct delaunay triangulations by inserting points incrementally and applying bi - stellar flips after each point insertion .",
    "edelsbrunner and shah  @xcite extended this result to higher dimensional point sets and to weighted delaunay triangulations .",
    "recently , shewchuk  @xcite showed that a combination of flips and some other local operation called star splay can convert an ",
    "almost delaunay \" triangulation to the delaunay one quite efficiently .",
    "all the aforementioned results deal with full dimensional triangulations of a point set .",
    "an important case of triangulations which are not full dimensional is surface triangulations in three dimensions . given the increasing demand of computing surface triangulations that are sub - complexes of delaunay triangulations  @xcite , it is natural to ask if a surface triangulation can be converted to a delaunay one by edge flips and , if so , under what conditions .",
    "such a flip algorithm will be useful in many applications .",
    "for example , in geometric modeling , shapes are often represented with subdivision surfaces  @xcite or with isosurfaces  @xcite .",
    "these surfaces are not necessarily delaunay .",
    "if one can convert these surfaces to a delaunay one , a number of tools that exploit delaunay properties can be used for further processing .    in this work",
    "we address the question of delaunay flips in surface triangulations .",
    "notice that our goal is to convert a surface triangulation embedded in @xmath3 to another surface triangulation which is a sub - complex of the three dimensional delaunay triangulation of the vertex set .",
    "this is different from the framework considered elsewhere  @xcite where a triangulated surface endowed with a flat metric is converted into an intrinsic delaunay triangulation comprised of simplices ( not necessarily planar ) embedded in the surface . in this case",
    "the embedding of the surface in @xmath3 does not play any role whereas in our case the positions of the vertices in @xmath3 determine the delaunay flips .",
    "it turns out that dense surface triangulations are amenable to a simple edge flip algorithm .",
    "a triangulation is dense if it approximates a smooth surface with sufficient resolution .",
    "we show that a dense triangulation can be flipped to a delaunay triangulation if the density is uniform in some sense .",
    "the condition on uniformity depends on the density .",
    "the higher the density , the less stringent is the condition .",
    "the practical implication of this result is that reasonably dense triangulations can be converted to delaunay triangulations with a simple edge flip algorithm .",
    "such dense triangulations are numerous in practice .",
    "subdivision and isosurface meshes are two such examples .",
    "triangulations of moving vertices offer another such example  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the results in this paper have been used for a recent algorithm on maintaining deforming meshes with provable guarantees  @xcite .",
    "what happens if we do not have the uniformity condition ?",
    "we show that the flip algorithm still terminates but the output surface may not be delaunay . nonetheless , this surface is  almost delaunay \" in the sense that the diametric ball of each triangle shrunk by a small amount remains empty .",
    "bandyopadhyay and snoeyink  @xcite showed the usefulness of such approximate delaunay triangulations in molecular modeling . because of the approximate emptiness properties of the circumscribing balls of the triangles , these approximate delaunay triangulations may find other applications where exact delaunay triangulations are not required .",
