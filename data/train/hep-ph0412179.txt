    "numerous papers has been devoted to the study of meson spectra in the framework of the potential model . in most of these works , it is assumed that the quark interaction is dominated by a linear confinement potential , and that a supplementary short - range potential stems from the one - gluon exchange mechanism ( see for instance refs .",
    "the results obtained with these models are generally in good agreement with the experiments but the mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not be described without adding an appropriate flavor mixing procedure with supplementary parameters .",
    "on the other hand , blask _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed a non - relativistic quark model which describes quite well all mesons ( including @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and baryons composed of @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 quarks .",
    "the long - range part of their interaction is the usual linear confinement potential , but their short - range part is a pairing force stemming from instanton effects .",
    "this force presents the peculiarities to act only on quark - antiquark states with zero spin and zero angular momentum , and to generate constituent masses for the light quarks . the main problem of this model , and more generally of all non - relativistic models , is that the velocity of a light quark inside a meson is not small compared with the speed of light .",
    "this makes the interpretation of the parameters of such models questionable @xcite .    at present",
    ", several works have been devoted to the study of mesons with the instanton induced forces in the framework of relativistic or semi - relativistic models @xcite , but in all the cases constituent masses and coupling constants of the instanton induced forces have been considered has free parameters fitted to reproduce at best meson spectra .",
    "actually , these quantities can be calculated from instanton theory . in this work ,",
    "our purpose is to develop a semi - relativistic model for meson spectra including the instanton induced forces , but with parameters calculated , as far as possible , with the underlying theory .",
    "we will show that such a procedure is possible and gives very good results provided the quarks are considered as effective degrees of freedom with a finite size .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model is constructed and the various parameters are presented , including the quark size parameters . the numerical techniques and the fitting procedure for the parameters are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , where the results are analyzed and a further test of the model is achieved with the calculation of the electromagnetic mass differences .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "our models rely on the spinless salpeter equation .",
    "this equation is not a covariant one , but it takes into account the relativistic kinematics .",
    "it can be deduced from the bethe - salpeter equation by neglecting the retardation effects , the mixing with negative energy states and the spinor structure of the eigenstates .",
    "the spinless salpeter equation has been often used to describe meson spectra ( see for instance refs .",
    "this equation has the following form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the potential between the particles and where @xmath7 is their relative momentum .",
    "the vector @xmath7 is the conjugate variable of the inter - distance @xmath8 .    as usual",
    ", we assume that the isospin symmetry is not broken , that is to say that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks have the same mass . in the following , these two quarks will be named by the symbol @xmath9 ( for normal or non - strange quark ) .",
    "it is now well accepted that the long range part of the interquark interaction is dominated by the confinement .",
    "the best way to simulate this phenomenon in a semi - relativistic equation is to use a potential increasing linearly with the distance .",
    "with such an interaction , the regge trajectories of light mesons are well reproduced @xcite . moreover",
    ", lattice calculations also find that the confinement is roughly proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the short range part is very often a coulomb - like interaction stemming from the one - gluon exchange process .",
    "the idea is that , once the confinement is taken into account , other contributions to the potential energy can be treated as residual interactions .",
    "it is worth noting that the contribution of a constant potential is always necessary to obtain good spectra .",
    "finally , the central potential considered in our models is the so - called funnel potential @xcite @xmath11 despite its simple form , this potential was the first one which is able to reproduce the charmonium spectrum quite well @xcite .",
    "moreover , it gives very good results even in the light meson sector ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "experiment shows that vibrational and orbital excitations give much more contributions to the meson masses than variations of spin @xmath12 or total angular momentum @xmath13 in a multiplet . in this case , a spinless salpeter equation , only supplemented by the funnel potential , can yield very satisfactory results .",
    "nevertheless , the situation is completely different for the @xmath14 mesons for which the mass differences between @xmath15 and @xmath16 states is extremely large . for these mesons , another interaction must be taken into account in the model .",
    "the instanton induced interaction provides a suitable formalism to reproduce well the pseudoscalar spectrum .",
    "indeed it is possible to explain the masses of the pion and the kaon and to describe states with flavor mixing as @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons .",
    "the form of the interaction depends on the quantum numbers of the state @xcite .    * for @xmath17 or @xmath18 : @xmath19 * for @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 * for @xmath20 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 * for @xmath20 and @xmath25 : @xmath26    in the flavor space @xmath27 .",

    "this is a cutoff value for which the lnln - term in eq .",
    "( [ ins7 ] ) is still reasonably small compared with the ln - term .",
    "an interesting property of the instanton induced interaction is the renormalization of quark masses , as it gives contributions to the constituent masses .",
    "the expression of these contributions are given by @xcite @xmath41 and @xmath42 the instanton interaction is not necessarily the only source for the constituent masses @xcite .",
    "actually we introduce two supplementary terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 which can be added to the running masses .",
    "these terms are free parameters and are not dependent on the instanton parameters .",

    "the value of this ration is 1 .",
    "this last value corresponds to the minimum of the instanton density ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : d0 ] ) .",
    "thus we define the parameter @xmath56 by @xmath57.\\ ] ] in this work @xmath56 is a pure phenomenological parameter whose value must be contained between 0 and 1 . to save calculation times , we have calculated some values of @xmath58 functions for some given values of @xmath56 , and we use a spline algorithm to find others values . a good accuracy can be obtained since these functions and their derivatives are known .",
    "we have verified that the spline procedure allows an accuracy better than @xmath59 on values of quark masses and instanton coupling constants .",

    "[ fig : anxc ] .",
    "the quark masses used in our model are the constituent masses and not the current ones .",
    "it is then natural to suppose that a quark is not a pure point - like particle , but an effective degree of freedom which is dressed by the gluon and quark - antiquark pair cloud .",
    "as a correct description of this effect is far from being obvious , we use a phenomenological _ anstze _ , as it is the case in many other works ( see for instance refs .",
    "it seems natural to consider that the probability density of a quark in the configuration space is a peaked function around its average position .",
    "the form that we retain is a gaussian function @xmath65 it is generally assumed that the quark size @xmath66 depends on the flavor .",
    "so , we consider two size parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 for quarks @xmath9 and @xmath4 respectively . any operator which depends on the quark positions @xmath69 and @xmath70 must be replaced by an effective one which is obtained by a double convolution of the original bare operator with the density functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 . as",
    "a double convolution is a heavy procedure which generates very complicated form for the convoluted potentials , we assume that the dressed expression @xmath73 of a bare operator @xmath74 , which depends only on the relative distance @xmath75 between the quarks @xmath76 and @xmath77 , is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is also a gaussian function of type ( [ rhoi ] ) with the size parameter @xmath80 given by @xmath81 this formula is chosen because the convolution of two gaussian functions , with size parameters @xmath66 and @xmath82 respectively , is also a gaussian function with a size parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ gij ] ) .",
    "after convolution with the quark density , the funnel dressed potential has the following form @xmath83 + c,\\ ] ] while the dirac - distribution is transformed into a gaussian function @xmath84 despite this convolution , we will consider , for simplicity , that the instanton induced forces act only on @xmath14 states .",
    "the modification of the confinement potential seems very important but , actually , only its short range part is modified .",
    "it has little effect for a potential whose essential role is to govern the long range dynamics .",
    "it has been verified @xcite that the convolution of the linear potential could be neglected without changing sensibly the results , but we have nevertheless used the form  ( [ vfund ] ) to be consistent .",
    "the coulomb part of the interaction is transformed into a potential with a finite value at origin .",
    "this can be seen as a mean to simulate asymptotic freedom .",
    "it has also been noticed that the use of an error function remove the singularity of the spin - spin interaction , when this correction is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a quark size is only necessary , from a mathematical point of view , to avoid collapse of the eigenvalues due to the presence of a dirac - distribution in the instanton induced interaction .",
    "the definition of the size parameter @xmath80 is not obvious in the case of the non - diagonal term of the instanton induced interaction ( [ ins4 ] ) .",
    "this matrix element mixes @xmath85 and @xmath86 flavor states .",
    "so , what definition choose for @xmath80 , that we will note @xmath87 in this case ?",
    "a first possibility is to take @xmath88 as in the case of @xmath89 mesons .",
    "but we can also choose @xmath90 for instance .",
    "other choices are possible , but we only take into account these two definitions in the following .",
    "the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of our hamiltonian are obtained in expanding trial states in a harmonic oscillator basis @xmath91 .",
    "in such a basis , matrix elements of the potential are given by @xmath92 with @xmath93 the quantities @xmath94 are the talmi integrals , while the coefficients @xmath95 are geometric factors @xcite which can be calculated once for all .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is the oscillator length which fixes the scale of the basis states . with this parameter",
    "a dimensionless length @xmath97 can be defined . in our model",
    "all the talmi integrals for the potential part of the hamiltonian are given by analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the kinetics part can be calculated with numerical integrations , but we prefer to use another technique , much accurate and less time consuming . this method is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . we just give here the main hits of the procedure .",
    "we calculate the matrix elements of the operator @xmath98 in the oscillator basis ( this is an analytical calculation ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath99 is the corresponding matrix , @xmath100 the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of @xmath99 , and @xmath101 the transformation matrix ( @xmath102 .",
    "then the matrix elements of the operator @xmath103 , are contained in the matrix @xmath104 .",
    "this procedure is about six times faster than a numerical integration and gives a better accuracy .",
    "the utilisation of this procedure and the analiticity of the talmi integrals lead to very short time of calculation .",
    "a minimization with thirteen parameters lasts about 1020 minutes on a pentium 200 workstation .    at last",
    ", it is worth noting that all the results obtained with the technique described above have been verified with the three - dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to try to reproduce the spectrum of light mesons with a quite simple model .",
    "indeed we use only a central potential supplemented by an instanton induced interaction to describe the pseudoscalar sector .",
    "we need thirteen parameters to obtain a satisfactory theoretical spectrum .",
    "the instanton interaction is defined by six parameters : the current quark masses , the quark condensates for the flavors @xmath9 and @xmath4 , the qcd scale parameter @xmath39 , and the maximum size @xmath40 of the instanton .",
    "three parameters are used for the spin - independent part of the potential : the slope of the confinement @xmath105 , the strength @xmath106 for the coulomb - like part , and the constant @xmath107 which renormalize the energy .",
    "four supplementary parameters are introduced : the effective size of the quarks @xmath9 and @xmath4 , and two terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which contribute to the constituent quarks masses .    in our model ,",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath108 , @xmath12 and @xmath109 are good quantum numbers . for @xmath14 states ,",
    "the instanton induced interaction raises the degeneracy between @xmath15 ( pseudoscalar ) and @xmath16 ( vector ) mesons , but @xmath16 @xmath110-mesons , which differ only by isospin , have the same mass .",
    "this is in quite good agreement with the data . in the sector @xmath111 , instanton induced interaction vanishes and the potential is spin independent .",
    "consequently , states which differ only by @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath109 are degenerate . in first approximation",
    ", this corresponds also quite well to the experimental situation .    to find the value of the parameters ,",
    "we minimize a @xmath112 function based on the masses of 18 centers of gravity ( c.o.g . )  of multiplets containing well - known mesons ( see table  [ tab : meson ] ) : @xmath113 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath114 is the error on the experimental masses ( it is fixed at the minimum value of 10 mev ) . the quantum number @xmath115 ( vibrational or radial quantum number ) , @xmath108 , and @xmath12 of these mesons",

    "all these models have common features . for instance , it is always possible to obtain a quite good fit with a low current quark mass @xmath121 , in agreement with the bounds expected @xcite .",
    "the strange quark mass @xmath122 varies more significantly following the model , but its value is always reasonable @xcite .",
    "the qcd scale parameter @xmath39 is a very sensible parameter of our model since a small change can largely modify the quantities deduced from the instanton theory ( see eq .",

    ". values for the quark condensates are also reasonable @xcite . there is no direct measurement of the string tension parameter @xmath105 , but lattice calculations favor the value 0.20 gev@xmath123 with about 30 % error @xcite .",
    "our values are in good agreement with this prediction .",
    "the strength @xmath106 of the coulomb - like potential can strongly vary from one model to another ( see for instance ref .",
    "the values found in this paper are always less than 0.5 , which can be considered as an upper limit for relevant values . in model",
    "v , we have fixed @xmath124 as in the model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath112 obtained is not good ; this is essentially due to radial excitations : @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude that the coulomb - like potential must be taken into account and that instanton induced forces can not explain alone the short range part of the potential .",
    "actually , this remark is already mentioned in the ref .",
    "as we can see from table  [ tab : param ] , the constant potential is always necessary to obtain good spectra .",
    "its origin is not simple to explain .",
    "it can be considered as a mechanism linked to the flux - tube model of mesons @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "our models are not in very good agreement with this last prediction , as we can note deviation as large as 40 % .",
    "but we do not consider that it is as an important drawback of the models .",
    "there is no real estimation of the quark sizes .",
    "they are purely phenomenological parameters whose role is to take into account relativistic effects @xcite as well as sea - quark contributions . in all our models the size of the @xmath9-quarks @xmath67 is nearly a constant , around 0.70.8 gev@xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath9-quark size drops down to 0.6 gev@xmath129 in model v without the coulomb - like potential .",
    "this shows the strong influence of this interaction in determining @xmath67 .",
    "it is worth noting that the introduction of quark sizes modifies deeply the structure of the potential .",

    "this is no longer true if @xmath131 . the first definition of @xmath87 is chosen in model ii and we can remark that in this case the value of @xmath68 is significantly smaller than in other models , where the second definition is used .",
    "table  [ tab : param ] shows that the contributions of parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be quite large when they are not fixed in the minimization .",

    "model  iii has actually the lowest @xmath112 value that we have found but the constituent quark masses are so small that a generalization of this model to baryon spectra appears very problematic @xcite .    in all sets of parameters that we have determined",

    "this is consistent with the fact that the cutoff radius for the integration over instanton density must be small enough in order that the lnln - term in eq .",

    "it is worth noting that our models are optimized to reproduce meson mass spectra with an accuracy of around 10 mev , and not to obtain the best possible wave function .",
    "so , we consider that the results found are quite well satisfactory .",
    "we also tried to calculate the electromagnetic mass differences with the non - relativistic equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ hem ] ) , but the results obtained are very bad .",
    "for instance , isospin breaking between @xmath3 and @xmath2 quark can be found as large as 50 mev .",
    "we have found that the non - relativistic form of the electromagnetic spin - spin interaction is responsible of so poor results .",
    "this indicates that relativized forms of operators are important to obtain coherent results in semi - relativistic models .",
    "since the coulomb - like strong interaction is of pure vector type , a strong spin - spin interaction must be introduced if one wants to take into account the relativistic corrections of the strong potential .",
    "we can guess that the use of a relativized form will be highly preferable than the usual non - relativistic form .",
    "it is well known that the spinless salpeter equation supplemented by the so - called funnel potential can describe quite well the main features of the meson spectra @xcite .",
    "the mass differences between members of a @xmath108-multiplet are generally small with respect to vibrational and radial excitations . except in the pseudoscalar meson sector , the spinless approximation is then generally good .",
    "the instanton induced forces provide a satisfactory way to describe the structure of light s - wave mesons , including the annihilation phenomenon .",
    "several works are devoted to the study of meson spectra within relativistic or semi - relativistic models using instanton effects @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the instanton parameters are simply considered as free parameters to be fitted on data . in our paper , we try to calculate these parameters from the underlying theory .",
    "our model relies on the spinless salpeter equation supplemented by the usual funnel potential and an instanton induced force .",
    "thirteen parameters are necessary to completely fix the hamiltonian",
    ". this number could appear large , but six parameters are strongly constrained by experimental or theoretical considerations , namely , the current quark masses , the qcd scale parameter , the quark condensates and the string tension .",
    "the coulomb strength and the constant potential are unavoidable parameters of potential models .",
    "actually , the coulomb - like potential could be replaced by an interaction taking into account the asymptotic freedom , but it is a complication especially necessary when describing heavy meson spectra .",
    "the relevance of the remaining five parameters is most questionable .",
    "if quarks are considered as effective degrees of freedom , then a size as well as a constituent mass can be associated with a quark .",
    "generally , the quark size is described with a two parameter function of the constituent mass . as we consider only two different flavors , it is useless to introduce such a quark size parameterization .",
    "up to our knowledge , there is no reliable estimation of the quark size , but our values are in good agreement with values found in other works @xcite .",
    "the radial part of the instanton induced potential is a dirac - distribution , so it is necessary to replace this form by a short range potential peaked at origin .",
    "the introduction of quark sizes offers a natural way to realize that , without introducing a new free parameter which is the instanton range .",
    "the two dimensioned coupling constants of the instanton induced force are calculated from the instanton theory .",
    "this interaction generates also constituent masses for the light quarks .",
    "our work shows that other contributions must be added to explain the large constituent masses of @xmath9 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "these contributions which lay between 100 and 200 mev are quite large .",
    "it is possible to cancel them , but the price to pay is then to obtain unrealistic very small constituent masses .",
    "we consider that it is better to keep the large values of these contributions .",
    "their origin is not clear but sea - quark or relativistic effects could explain their presence .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 reflects the uncertainties about the form of the instanton density , which is known within the two - loop approximation .",
    "the values found in all models are consistent with the fact that the cutoff radius of the instanton size must be small .",
    "we have shown that the light meson spectra can be described by a semi - relativistic model including an instanton induced force whose characteristics are calculated from the underlying theory . moreover ,",
    "calculation of electromagnetic mass differences between mesons indicate that the wave function obtained are quite satisfactory .",
    "the next steps are to calculate meson widths and to generalize the model to baryons .",
    "such a work is in progress .",
