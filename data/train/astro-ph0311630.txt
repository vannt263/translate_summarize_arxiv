    "the definition of @xmath3 is not affected by the choice of this model .",
    "we use this procedure because in most cases the energy range of hete2 ( 2400 kev ) is not broad enough to determine good values of @xmath1 and the values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are less constrained if we use the band function [ band ] .     versus the break energy @xmath2,,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] [ alphaeo ]",

    "the two dotted lines represent the limits ( in terms of @xmath14 ) of the 3 populations .",

    "to this end we looked how grbs with known redshift would evolve on this diagram ( [ durete2 ] ) if their redshifts were increased to z = 10 .",
    "we added lines on figure [ durete1 ] which indicate the evolution of these grbs ( ie grb010921 z = .45 , grb020124 z = 3.2 , grb020813 z = 1.25 , grb021004 z = 2.31 , grb021211 z = 1.01 , grb030226 z = 1.98 , grb030323 z = 3.37 , grb030328 z = 1.52 , grb030329 z = .17 , grb030429 z = 2.65 ) .",

    "what we notice here is that these grbs have their total fluence which decreases while their softness increases with the redshift .",

    "this value is very small compared to the @xmath18 found for two bursts .",

    "the horizontal dashed lines represent the limits of the three classes .",
    "this figure first indicates that the softness is very well representative of the value of the @xmath3 .",
    "this is very important for spectral analysis indeed the @xmath3 is often hard to calculate because the value of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are sometimes not well constrained , especially for soft bursts which have their value of @xmath2 near the lower limit of the energy range of hete-2 ( for example grb010213 has @xmath19 kev and it is clear that the value of @xmath0 ca nt be well determinated and so the value of @xmath3 ) whereas the fluence in all energy ranges can always be calculated .",
    "this plot also shows that the distribution of @xmath3 covers a broad energy range similar to that covered by hete-2 from few kev to several hundred kev .",
    "in addition of the distribution found by batse which peaks at 200 kev hete-2 had allowed the detection of many bursts which have their @xmath3 lower than 50 kev .",
    "this makes this distribution very broad .",
    "grbs which have a low @xmath3 are associated with x - ray - rich grbs ( the middle part of the plot ) and x - ray - flashes ( the upper part of the plot ) .",
    "in this paper , we update the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the update consists of an increase of the number of grbs to 50 , and an analysis which is now based on joint spectra with both wxm and fregate data .",
    "joint spectra allow to study spectra from 2 kev to 400 kev and thus provide more accurate values of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and fluence ratios .",
    "+ the first important result of this study comes from the distribution of the spectral parameter @xmath0 which is fully in agreement with the predictions of the synchrotron shock model .",
    "+ we have also shown that the new class of `` soft '' grbs can not apparently be explained as high redshift grbs .",
    "but we have confirmed and extended the hardness - intensity correlation which strongly suggests that the three classes of grbs , x - ray - rich grbs and x - ray - flashes , which distinguish themselves by the values of their @xmath3 and their softness are all from the same phenomenon . more grbs and more broad energy coverage of grb missions will allow to refine these results and constrain models of the prompt emission of grbs ."
