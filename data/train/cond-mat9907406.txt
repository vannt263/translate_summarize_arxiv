    "notwithstanding theoretically , given heuristical arguments@xcite and numerical investigations ( e.g. the landauer conductance for quasiperiodic penrose lattices @xcite or kubo formula for 3d - quasiperiodic models @xcite ) yield to uncomplete understanding of the observed properties which range from anomalously metallic behaviors to insulating ones @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that a specific `` geometrical localization process '' takes place in quasicrystals ( sustained by critical states@xcite ) and that local disruptions of corresponding mesoscopic order reduce quantum interferences , resulting in an increase of conductivity .",
    "this issue has been takled for 1d quasiperiodic potential , tight - binding ( tbm ) as well as continuous kronig - penney models , and phason - type disorder has been shown to disclose manifestations of quantum interferences ( qie ) in quasiperiodic order @xcite .",

    "the effect of disorder on top of these states is thus a complicated issue and very scarce rigorous results are available in the litterature .",
    "attempts to rigorously establish analytical results in high - dimensional quasiperiodic systems have been facing some limitations despite encouraging early attempts @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we review exact results carried out on 1d umperfected quasiperiodic systems .",
    "we also give additional and complementary results to enlarge the understanding of an early study@xcite besides , the role of quantum interferences on both sides of the quasicrystalline mit for higher dimensional materials is outlined in a second part .",

    "introducing disorder could be done through typical randomizing of site or hopping energies , with the subsequent occurence of anderson localization in the infinite chain limit . for finite systems , localization lengthes",
    "may be much larger than the characteristic size so that conductance fluctuations as a function of energy of tunneling electrons ( from the leads to the system ) keep its self - similar nature and still follow power law behavior for system size studied in @xcite even when introducing disorder of @xmath1 of the total bandwith .",
    "however , the particular order sustaining long range quasiperiodicity suggest the possible presence of unique defects , known as phason - type defects . their geometrical definition and properties have been subjected to many studies@xcite , although some aspects remain controversial . from certain viewpoint",
    "it seems natural to consider how disruptions of quasiperiodic order inherent to such systems will degrade or improve transport properties .",

    "tight - binding models ( tbm ) of perfect quasiperiodic chains have been intensively worked out both analytically and numerically only for some given energies , but the results are supposed to have provided typical features of localization in quasiperiodic structures , such as power - law decrease of wavefunctions or power - law bounded resistances @xcite . however , if leading to interesting analytical results , tbm do not allow to simply investigate energy - dependent properties of quantum dynamics and electronic transport . following the works and discussions of kollar and sto@xcite , and m. baake et al.@xcite ,",

    "the landauer resistance of a finite chain n is given by @xmath34 where t is the fraction of tunneling electrons transmitted from the system to the leads , and r is the reflected one . for a tight - binding model one relates the resistance to the total transfer matrix elements : @xmath35 .",
