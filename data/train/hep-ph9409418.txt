    "nfc)@xcite at least three higgs doublets are needed for the scalar sector to allow @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "the effect can not be large in @xmath0 asymmetries in neutral @xmath2 decays or in @xmath0 violation in the @xmath6 system @xcite",
    ". however , there could be significant contributions to processes for which the sm prediction is small : the electric dipole moment of the neutron @xcite , @xmath0 asymmetries in top decays@xcite , and @xmath0 violation in semileptonic decays .",
    "as triple - vector correlation is odd under time - reversal , the experimental observation of such correlation would signal @xmath7 and  assuming @xmath8 symmetry ",
    "@xmath0 violation . in three body semileptonic decays the lepton transverse polarization is such an observable .",
    "it can not be generated by vector or axial - vector interactions only @xcite , so it is particularly suited for searching for @xmath0 violating mhdm contributions .",
    "the muon transverse polarization has been studied in @xmath9 decays @xcite . since in models with nfc scalars couple more strongly to heavier fermions , the expected signals are stronger in heavy quark decays @xcite .    for top",
    "decays the quark level description is valid , as the top quark is expected to decay before it hadronizes .",
    "this is , however , not the case for @xmath2 decays .",
    "recently , it has been observed that inclusive semileptonic decays of hadrons containing a single heavy quark allow for a systematic , qcd - based expansion in powers of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark limit coincides with the free quark decay model and there are no corrections to this result at order @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the leading nonperturbative corrections are of order @xmath11 and depend on only two hadronic parameters , which parameterize forward matrix elements of local dimension - five operators in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "these corrections have been computed for a number of processes @xcite .    using the combination of the operator product expansion and hqet , semileptonic",
    "@xmath2 meson decays into a tau lepton have been studied in the framework of the sm @xcite and mhdm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use this method to study the tau transverse polarization in the framework of mhdm .",
    "in addition to finding the correction to the spectator model result , this calculation has some interesting technical aspects .",
    "the nonanaliticity of the triple product correlation on the boundaries of the dalitz plot gives rise to infinities in the calculation .",
    "such divergencies do not appear in the calculations of either cross - sections or longitudinal polarization .",
    "we discuss their physical meaning and how to eliminate them .",
    "we consider a general multi higgs doublet model with nfc ( for a recent analysis and notation see @xcite ) . in order to have observable @xmath0 violation",
    ", the lightest charged scalar has to be much lighter than the heaviest one @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the all but the lightest charged scalars effectively decouple from the fermions .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the lightest charged scalar to up - type quarks , down - type quarks and charged leptons are determined by the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the running quark masses are denoted by an upper index @xmath13 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) gives the sm contribution , while the second one is that of the charged scalar .",
    "we neglect a term proportional to @xmath20 : first , it is suppressed by the mass ratio @xmath21 ; second , @xmath13 is bounded to be of @xmath22 , while @xmath12 can be large@xcite .    the tau transverse polarization , @xmath1 , in the decay @xmath15 is defined as the tau polarization component along the normal vector of the decay plane .",
    "it is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the tau spin three vector and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the three - momentum of the tau lepton ( hadron ) .",
    "we define @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) as the rate of finding the tau spin parallel ( anti - parallel ) to the normal vector of the decay plane . the total rate @xmath29 has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "we then have to calculate only @xmath30 .",
    "the techniques of the calculation are described in detail elsewhere @xcite , so we give only the necessary details , followed by the results of the computation .",
    "the asymmetry arises only from the interference between the @xmath31 mediated and the higgs mediated diagrams .",
    "the interference term in the hadronic current can be decomposed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 is the momentum of the lepton pair , and @xmath35 is the four - velocity of the decaying @xmath2 meson .",
    "we work in the @xmath2 rest frame , where @xmath36 is the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the tau spin projection is along the four - vector @xmath37,0)$ ] . upon contraction of the lepton current with @xmath38 , the term proportional to @xmath39 vanishes and the @xmath40 part yields the differential asymmetry @xmath41 where we defined dimensionless variables @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the energy of the tau ( neutrino ) .",
    "the ope yields for @xmath40 @xcite @xmath45\\ , \\delta^\\prime(\\hat z ) +    \\lo[4\\hqs-(x+y)^2]\\ , \\delta^{\\prime\\prime}(\\hat z ) \\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are parameters of the hqet , @xmath48 , and the prime means @xmath49 .    in order to obtain the total asymmetry we have to integrate ( [ difacp ] ) over @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52",
    "this integral diverges because the square root function is not analytic .",
    "the derivatives resulting from the @xmath53 and @xmath54 terms yield negative powers of the square root in ( [ difacp ] ) to be evaluated precisely at their pole .",
    "physically , the reason for this non - analyticity is that the orientation of the decay plane changes when the tau and the hadron momenta become collinear . at these points in phase - space ( corresponding to the boundary of the dalitz plot in the @xmath55 plane ) the decay plane is not well - defined , so neither is the transverse polarization . in order to regularize this divergence",
    ", we have to rely on the physical picture .",
    "experimentally the region near the boundary of the dalitz plot is not accessible : any finite resolution gives a region in which the transverse tau polarization is not measurable as even the decay plane can not be reconstructed .",
    "this suggests to regularize the divergencies by a simple cutoff , and then take the limit of the cutoff approaching the border of the dalitz plot .",
    "another possibility is to replace the square root by an analytic function , which means physically to make the flip of the orientation of the decay plane smooth .",
    "it is convenient to apply the following replacement @xmath56\\,,\\ ] ] and interchange the order of the integration with the @xmath57 limit .",
    "this procedure eliminates the infinities .",
    "in fact , this prescription is only sensitive to the derivatives of the regularized function at the points where the original square root function vanished ( these points constitute the border of the dalitz plot ) .",
    "since at these points all derivatives of ( [ reg ] ) vanish , this should reproduce the cutoff result .",
    "we checked that in the @xmath58 limit these two procedures indeed give identical results .",
    "( the calculation using a cutoff becomes unmanageable when we keep @xmath59 finite . )",
    "technically the replacement ( [ reg ] ) is much simpler than doing the full calculation with a cutoff .    after the integration we obtain for the @xmath0 violating asymmetry @xmath60 where @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ + { \\lo\\over 6m_b^2}\\ , c^3 & &    \\big[3(1-\\src)^2(8 + 5\\src+\\src^2 ) + 9\\srt(8 - 3\\src-4\\src^2-\\src^3 ) \\nonumber\\\\    & & + 4\\srt^2(8 - 9\\src-6\\src^2 ) + 9\\srt^3(1-\\src ) + 3\\srt^4 \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ + { \\lt\\over 2m_b^2}\\ , c^3 & &    \\big[3(-16 - 13\\src+9\\src^2 + 15\\src^3 + 5\\src^4 )    - 9\\srt(16 + 29\\src+20\\src^2 + 5\\src^3 ) \\nonumber\\\\    & & -4\\srt^2(2 + 45\\src+30\\src^2 ) + 45\\srt^3(1-\\src ) + 15\\srt^4 \\big ] \\bigg\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 .",
    "in the limit @xmath63 , corresponding to the free quark decay model , our results agree with ref.@xcite .",
    "( although ref.@xcite works in the tau rest frame , our definitions of the asymmetry are identical . )",
    "in our numerical analysis we use the same input parameters as in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us further define : @xmath64 the quantity @xmath65 enters the asymmetry @xmath66 through its numerator quadratically , and the denominator in a more complicated manner .",
    "the dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath67 is only through the total decay rate . in our analysis",
    "we use only the allowed values of @xmath65 and @xmath67 , and we discuss the present constraints on them below . by varying these parameters within their allowed ranges , we find the allowed values of @xmath66 as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "our result is given by the shaded region between the solid lines in fig .  1 .",
    "a few points are in order regarding this result :    @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath4 corrections to the free quark decay model decrease @xmath66 for all values of @xmath65 .",
    "the numerator is suppressed by about 25% .",
    "for small values or @xmath65 the denominator is also suppressed and the total correction is small . however , for large values of @xmath65 the total branching ratio is enhanced @xcite and @xmath66 can be suppressed by as much as 35% .",
    "@xmath69 . the uncertainty in our result ( corresponding to the width of the shaded region in fig .",
    "1 ) takes into account the theoretical uncertainties as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the improvement of our calculation over the spectator model originates from large @xmath4 corrections , and from using @xmath71 and @xmath59 as determined by the hqet rather than treating them as independent input parameters . to illustrate this",
    ", we plotted with dashed lines in fig .  1 the prediction of the free quark decay model corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 . even in the sm  fake \" asymmetries arise as a background due to @xmath0 conserving unitary phases from final state interaction ( fsi ) and from real intermediate states .",
    "these are expected to be less than 1% @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can be removed using the fact that asymmetries due to @xmath0 violating phases have different sign in @xmath2 and @xmath75 decays , while unitary phases yield asymmetries with the same sign @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our analysis we ignore them .",
    "the strongest bound on @xmath65 comes at present from the measurement of the ( unpolarized ) @xmath76 branching ratio . the total decay rate @xmath77 has the form @xmath78 where @xmath31 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) denotes the sm ( interference , higgs ) term .",
    "this is a circle in the complex @xmath81 plane , centered on the @xmath67 axis . in our analysis",
    "we set the value of @xmath67 to allow for maximal @xmath65 subject to the experimental constraint . from the measurements",
    "@xcite @xmath82 and using ref.@xcite we obtain at the @xmath83 level @xmath84    due to the negative sign of the interference term in ( [ rate ] ) , the strongest possible bound from the total branching ratio that can be obtained in the future is about @xmath85 .",
    "the longitudinal polarization of the tau in the same decay has a better sensitivity @xcite down to about @xmath86 .",
    "note , that from just one @xmath0 conserving observable no determination of @xmath65 is possible , since deviation from the sm prediction can also be induced by @xmath67 . in principle , however , by comparing two observables with different dependence on @xmath67 and @xmath65 one may be able to detect a nonzero @xmath65 .",
    "the purely leptonic decay @xmath87 is also sensitive to @xmath65 . using ref.@xcite and the recent aleph result @xcite @xmath88 together with the @xmath89 and @xmath90 bounds , we get @xmath91 due to the dependence on @xmath65 and the large theoretical uncertainties in the calculation we estimate that this bound can not become stronger in the future than @xmath92 .",
    "the bound on @xmath65 from @xmath1 of the muon in @xmath9 decays is obtained by converting the measured quantity , @xmath93 , to @xmath65 @xcite @xmath94 has been measured in both charged and neutral kaon decays .",
    "the background of these measurements due to @xmath0 conserving fsi phases are different . for the charged kaon decay @xmath95 ,",
    "fsi are second order in the electromagnetic interaction and therefore very small : @xmath96 @xcite . in neutral kaon decay @xmath97 ,",
    "there are two charged particles in the final state , and so fsi is first order in the electromagnetic interaction and can contribute to @xmath98 at the @xmath99 level .",
    "thus , in order to set a bound on @xmath65 we use @xmath100 instead of eq .",
    "( [ imbound ] ) , where @xmath101 @xcite . the pdg data @xcite @xmath102 yields at the @xmath83 level @xmath103 numerically , the bounds ( [ imrbound1 ] ) and ( [ imrbound2 ] ) are the same . however , we consider the bound ( [ imrbound2 ] ) less reliable as it is sensitive to the uncertainties in the form factors and in the fsi phases in @xmath104 decay .    in the near future",
    "the e246 experiment at kek will measure the transverse muon polarization in @xmath105 decay .",
    "they are aiming at a sensitivity to @xmath1 of about @xmath106 which corresponds to @xmath107  @xcite . from fig .",
    "1 we see that in order to achieve a better sensitivity to @xmath65 from the measurement of @xmath1 of the tau in @xmath76 decay , one needs to measure @xmath1 at an accuracy of better than @xmath108 .",
    "it is important whether @xmath1 of the tau can be reconstructed at all from its decay products in @xmath2 decays , either at lep , at @xmath2 factories , or in hadron colliders . to our knowledge , this issue is not yet settled and further experimental studies are called for .    one may naively expect that for the same @xmath0 violating parameters , the tau polarization in @xmath2 decays would be @xmath109 times larger than the muon polarization in @xmath110 decays .",
    "however , our calculation gives only about a factor of 40 enhancement .",
    "the scalar matrix element in exclusive @xmath110 decays is enhanced by a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "the finite mass effects in the phase space integrals reduce @xmath66 by about 45% in @xmath2 decays , while by only 30% in @xmath110 decays . finally , the @xmath4 corrections reduce @xmath66 in @xmath2 decays by up to 35% .",
    "in addition , the experimental measurement of the transverse muon polarization in @xmath110 decays is simpler than measuring the tau polarization in @xmath2 decays .",
    "thus we conclude that although most of the mhdm parameters are easier to probe in processes involving heavy fermions , it may be easier to constrain @xmath65 in kaon decays .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to ref.@xcite , which considers exclusive @xmath2 decays .",
    "there it was found that the allowed ranges for @xmath66 extend from @xmath112 in @xmath113 decay up to @xmath22 in the @xmath114 channel .",
    "we believe that the suppression that we found in the inclusive channel is likely to apply to the exclusive ones as well . on the one hand , it would be easier to measure @xmath66 in inclusive decays ( larger statistics , no need to reconstruct specific hadronic final states ) than in exclusive channels , and the exclusive calculation also suffers from larger theoretical uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , the results of ref.@xcite suggest that the asymmetry in the @xmath114 decay may be enhanced .",
    "finally , our analysis holds with minor modifications for inclusive @xmath115 and @xmath116 decays as well .",
    "however , the possible signals are smaller and harder to measure experimentally than in the @xmath15 and @xmath117 decay modes discussed above .",
    "we studied the transverse tau polarization asymmetry in inclusive @xmath15 decays in mhdm .",
    "we use the heavy quark expansion to incorporate the nonperturbative @xmath4 corrections . unlike previous cases , in the present calculation divergencies appear that have to be carefully removed .",
    "the @xmath4 corrections turn out to be important and reduce the asymmetry by as much as 30% in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "we studied the present and possible future experimental bounds on the @xmath0 violating parameter of the higgs sector , @xmath118 .",
    "the strongest bound comes at present from the measured @xmath15 branching ratio . in the future  even if a new source of @xmath0 violation will not be discovered by e246 at kek  the bound on the measurement of the muon transverse polarization in @xmath9 will provide the strongest constraint .",
