    "<S> in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , early stage multiple scatterings may lead to an increase of the color electric field strength . consequently , particle production - especially heavy quark ( and di - quark ) production - is greatly enhanced according to the schwinger mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we test this idea via the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd ) for au+au collisions at the full rhic energy ( @xmath0 agev ) . </S>",
    "<S> relative to p+p collisions , a factor of 60 , 20 and 7 enhancement respectively , for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is predicted for a model with increased color electric field strength .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 )    one of the major goals of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory is to explore the phase diagram of hot and dense matter near the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the qgp is a state in which the individual hadrons dissolve into a gas of free ( or almost free ) quarks and gluons in strongly compressed and hot matter ( for recent reviews on the topic , we refer to @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the achievable energy- and baryon densities depend on the extend to which the nuclei are stopped during penetration , thus on centrality and bombarding energy .    </S>",
    "<S> strange particles , especially multi - strange baryons ( which have more than one strange quark ) carry vital information about the collision dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> relative strangeness abundancies have been proposed as a powerful tool for searching the transition from hadronic matter to partonic matter in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . indeed , strangeness enhancement has be observed in heavy ion collisions at all collision energies with different colliding systems .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , measurements by the wa97 and the na49 collaborations clearly demonstrated the relative enhancement of the ( anti-)hyperon yields ( @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) in pb - pb collisions as compared to p - pb collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed enhancement increases with the strangeness content ( @xmath8 ) of the probe under investigation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the ( @xmath9)-yield the enhancement factor is as large as 15 .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of different mechanisms are under debate to understand this strong increase in strangeness production with centrality and beam energy :    * equilibrated ( gluon rich ) plasma phase : chemical and flavour equilibration times are predicted to be shorter in a plasma phase than in a thermally equilibrated hadronic fireball of @xmath10mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a dominant production mechanism for strangeness in an equilibrated gluon rich plasma phase ( hot glue scenario @xcite ) , might be the production of @xmath11 pairs via gluon fusion ( @xmath12 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this might allow for strangeness equilibration within the lifetime of the qgp , resulting in strong strangeness enhancement compared to hadronic scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> * baryon - junctions : a baryon junction exchange mechanism was proposed to explain valence baryon number transport in nuclear collisions . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was extended to study midrapidity ( anti-)hyperon production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that baryon junction - anti - junction ( j anti - j ) loops can indeed enhance anti - lambda , anti - xi , anti - omega yields at sps energies . </S>",
    "<S> while this mechanism leads to a reasonable description of central interactions , it can not explain the enhancement in the measured hyperon to anti - hyperon ratios with increasing centrality . </S>",
    "<S> * diquark breaking and sea - diquarks : a new version of the dual parton model , featuring an improved diquark breaking mechanism has been applied to explain the observed strangeness enhancement at the full sps energy @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the strange- and anti - baryon production invokes strings originating from diquark - antidiquark pairs in the nucleon sea to reproduces the observed yields of p and lambda and their antiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> however cascades are underestimated by 50% and omega s are underestimated by a factor five . agreement with measured data can only be achieved in this model if additional final state interactions among hadrons are taken into account . * </S>",
    "<S> strong color fields : another kind of string - hadronic models employs the schwinger mechanism @xcite of a fragmenting color field ( string ) directly </S>",
    "<S> . however , in central high energy heavy ion collisions the string density can be so high that the color flux tubes overlap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the superposition of the color electric fields yields an enhanced particle production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the heavy flavors and diquarks are dramatically enhanced due to a higher effective string tension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the strong color field leads to the enhancement not only of the heavy flavors and diquarks but also enhances the high @xmath13 tail of the transverse momentum distribution of all created particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , the changes in the final @xmath13 are rather moderate in aa collisions due to final state interactions @xcite . a consistent enhancement of hyperons and anti - protons is necessary to support this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown that this approach is consistent with the measured anti - proton and hyperon yields at sps energies , if rescattering effects are taken into account @xcite .    as a tool for our investigation of heavy ion reactions at rhic the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd 1.2 ) </S>",
    "<S> is applied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> urqmd is a microscopic transport approach based on the covariant propagation of constituent quarks and diquarks accompanied by mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it simulates multiple interactions of ingoing and newly produced particles , the excitation and fragmentation of color strings and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . at rhic energies , the treatment of subhadronic degrees of freedom is of major importance . in the urqmd model , </S>",
    "<S> these degrees of freedom enter via the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the leading hadrons of the fragmenting strings contain the valence - quarks of the original excited hadron . in urqmd </S>",
    "<S> they are allowed to interact even during their formation time , with a reduced cross section defined by the additive quark model , thus accounting for the original valence quarks contained in that hadron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those leading hadrons therefore represent a simplified picture of the leading ( di)quarks of the fragmenting string . </S>",
    "<S> newly produced ( di)quarks do , in the present model , not interact until they have coalesced into hadrons  </S>",
    "<S> however , they contribute to the energy density of the system . for further details about the urqmd model , the reader is referred to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the following two different scenarios will be explored in order to study the speculation of a string tension increase in heavy ion collision at rhic energies : urqmd calculations with the standard color flux tube break - up mechanism ( i.e. a string tension @xmath14  gev / fm ) will be contrasted by urqmd simulations with an in - medium @xmath15 increased to 3  gev / fm . according to the implemented schwinger mechanism for the string fragmentation ( @xmath16 denoting the ( ( di-)quark masses ) @xmath17 this results in an enhancement of the strangeness and diquark production probabilities to @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( for @xmath20  gev / fm ) compared to @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23  gev / fm . </S>",
    "<S> note that a decrease of the ( di-)quark masses due to chiral symmetry restoration may lead to a similar enhancement as the @xmath20  gev / fm scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rapidity ] depicts the particle rapidity distributions ( a , b ) and ratios from au+au ( b = 2  fm ) to p+p collisions ( c , d ) at the rhic full energy @xmath0agev . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols denote : @xmath24 ( full circles ) , @xmath25 ( full triangles ) , @xmath26 ( reversed triangle ) , @xmath27 ( full square ) and anti - protons ( open circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) shows the rapidity distributions with string tension @xmath28gev / fm ; ( b ) shows the same as ( a ) with @xmath29gev / fm . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) depicts the ratio @xmath30 of the particle yields per participant from central aa collisions over that of the p+p collisions with @xmath28gev / fm ; ( d ) same as ( c ) , however with @xmath29gev / fm for au+au .    </S>",
    "<S> a strong enhancement of the ( anti-)hyperon production compared to scaled pp interactions is predicted ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is purely due to rescattering between constituent ( di-)quarks and hadrons in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> if strong color fields , similar to pb+pb at sps @xcite , are present , the model predicts a dramatic enhancement in the multi - strange hadron production , up to a factor of 100 ( in case of the omega ) at midrapidity .    </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the hyperon yields is strongly dependent on the centrality of the events as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the symbols are : @xmath24 ( full circles ) , @xmath25 ( full triangles ) , @xmath26 ( reversed triangle ) , @xmath27 ( full square ) and anti - protons ( open circles ) .    the 4@xmath33 yields and ratios as a function of number of participants from au+au at the rhic full energy @xmath0agev increase rapidly with centrality ( a , b ) by two orders of magnitude when going from peripheral ( @xmath34 ) to central collision . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement itself is most pronounced when scaled with the number of participating nucleons @xmath35 and compared to p+p collisions at the rhic full energy ( c , d ) .    finally , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ probabity ] depicts an inside view into a central ( b=2  fm ) au+au collision at the full rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> open circles show the mass distribution of excited strings . </S>",
    "<S> filled circles and squares represent the probabilities of a @xmath36-[\\,\\overline 3\\,]$ ] string of a given mass to decay into @xmath1s with @xmath15 = 1 and 3 gev / fm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the string tension to @xmath20  gev / fm leads to a strong increase of the omega production over all inspected string masses ( compare full circle with full squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the probability to excite a string with a large mass is strongly suppressed , as can been seen by the exponential decrease of probabilities above excitation energies of 2  gev . therefore , most of the @xmath1 s are produced from rather low mass strings . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the expectations that early ( high energetic ) collisions lead to high mass excitations and give the major contribution to the multi - strange hyperon yield .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the urqmd model has been applied to au+au reactions at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> this model treats the dynamics of the hot and dense system by constituent ( di-)quark and hadronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> ( anti-)hyperon yields in central au+au collisions at the full rhic energy ( @xmath37  agev ) strongly enhanced in comparison to inelastic pp interactions at @xmath37  gev or peripheral au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement grows dramatically with the strangeness content of the hyperon . </S>",
    "<S> the present model predicts that strangeness enhancement occurs as a threshold effect already at rather small number of participants @xmath38 due to rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the string tension , similar to sps energies ( or reducing the effective masses of the constituent quarks to the current quark mass values yields large additional enhancement , which grows with the strangeness content even stronger : @xmath5 s are enhancement by a factor of 7 , while @xmath1 s are enhanced by a factor of 60 compared to pp . </S>"
