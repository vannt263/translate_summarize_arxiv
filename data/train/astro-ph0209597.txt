    "in recent years the traditional view of elliptical galaxies as simple systems of non interacting stars , devoid of interstellar matter , has radically changed .",
    "observations across the electromagnetic spectrum have demonstrated that the interstellar medium ( ism ) in elliptical galaxies contains substantial amounts of cold gas and dust in addition to hot gas , the dominant component .",
    "far - ir emission detected by the iras satellite and improved optical imaging of elliptical galaxies provide clear evidence for the presence of dust .",
    "however , estimates of the total amount of dust , as well as its origin and spatial distribution , remain uncertain and controversial .",
    "optical observations indicate dust masses that are one order of magnitude less than those inferred by iras . we have recently embarked on a program to study the infrared emission from early - type galaxies using the large database of observations taken by the iso satellite .",
    "our principal goals are to observe the spatial location and emission spectrum of dust throughout elliptical galaxies , and with this information , to determine the origin , evolution , and physical properties of dust in massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "iso provides a vast amount of data with good spatial resolution in the mid and far - ir for a large number of elliptical galaxies . a good fraction of these observations",
    "have been taken using isophot in several observing modes ( astronomical observing template ) , including the oversampled maps p32 , the p37/38/39 sparse maps and p22 multi - filter photometry data . here",
    "we present data from three very bright ellipticals located in virgo cluster : ngc4649 , ngc4472 , and ngc4636 .",
    "ngc4636 has been observed in the p37/39 aot mode at 60 , 100 , and 180 @xmath0 m .",
    "observations were made in each filter with one on - source single point staring mode and one off - source exposure .",
    "the background position was located @xmath1 north - east from the target , on blank sky position .",
    "data reduction and calibration were performed with the pia 9.1 package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reduction included correction for the non linear response of the detectors , readout deglitching , and linear fitting of the signal ramps .",
    "after resetting of all ramp slopes and subtracting the dark current , the flux densities were extracted using the power calibration of the reference lamps .",
    "after sky subtraction the on - source signal was corrected for the fraction of the point - spread function included within the detector s field of view .",
    "a color correction was applied assuming that the sed of the galaxy could be approximated by a blackbody curve with temperature of 30 k. we tested the c100 detector response on a number of galaxies observed in the same observing mode as ngc4636 .",
    "integrated fluxes from 8 ellipticals were compared to the iras values at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m . calibrated survey scans from the iras satellite were extracted using the scanpi software from ipac .",
    "a very good linear correlation between the iso and iras fluxes is seen at both wavelengths .",
    "ngc4649 and ngc4472 have been observed in p32 mode in three broadband filters at 60 , 90 and 180 @xmath0 m using the c100 and c200 detectors .",
    "the maps were obtained by scanning the spacecraft y and z axes in a grid of 4@xmath24 ( ngc4649 ) and 5@xmath24 ( ngc4472 ) points .",
    "the focal plane chopper was stepped at intervals of one - third of the detector pixel , at each raster position , providing a sky sampling in the y direction of 15 `` and 30 '' for the c100 and c200 detectors . to reduce the p32 data we used a dedicated software package developed at mpi kernphysik in heidelberg and supported by the vilspa iso data center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new routines allow a proper correction for transients in pht32 measurements .",
    "both ngc4472 and ngc4649 show no detectable emission at 60 , 90 , and 180 @xmath0 m .",
    "the maps reach the limiting sensitivity of the isophot instrument at a level of few tens of mjy and the 3@xmath3 upper limits are presented in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the 60 , 90 , and 180@xmath0 m maps for ngc4649 .",
    "the bright spiral companion ngc4647 , recorded at the edge of the maps , is well detected at all three wavelengths and is responsible for the high flux detection , erroneously attributed to ngc4649 , reported in literature from iras observations .",
    "in fact the angular resolution and beam size of the iras instruments were not able to disentangle the contribution of the two galaxies .",

    "mid - ir ( 6 - 15@xmath0 m ) iso observations of ngc4472 detect strong dust emission that can be understood as emission from circumstellar dust from mass - losing agb stars at or near the globally expected rate for this galaxy ( @xcite ) . since this dust should emit in the far - ir when it becomes interstellar",
    ", it may be significant that ngc4472 is not detected at @xmath11 m either by iso or iras ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now briefly describe an estimate of the far infrared emission from ngc4472 , assuming that the grains are dispersed in the hot interstellar gas before sputtering commences .",
    "first we calculate the temperature @xmath12 of dust grains of radius a ( in @xmath0 m ) at galactic radius @xmath13 and then determine the grain emissivity and luminosity for a distribution of initial grain sizes .",
    "since the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature is seen in emission in ngc4472 , we assume that all grains have properties similar to astronomical silicates ( @xcite ) . + the grain temperature is determined by both absorption of starlight and by electron - grain collisions : @xmath14 although we consider each type of heating separately .",
    "the mean intensity of starlight at wavelength @xmath15 ( in @xmath0 m ) is related to the b - band intensity @xmath16 and the sed @xmath17 taken from @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is found by integrating over a de vaucouleurs stellar profile with a `` nuker '' core of slope @xmath19 within @xmath20 ( @xcite ) . at a distance @xmath21 mpc ngc4472",
    "has an effective radius @xmath22 kpc and total stellar mass @xmath23 @xmath24 assuming @xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second term on the left represents heating by e@xmath26-grain collisions including a correction @xmath27 for small grains which do not completely stop the electrons ( @xcite ) . for astronomical silicate grains of radius less than @xmath28 m we can use the approximations @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for starlight heating the grain temperature @xmath31 k is independent of @xmath32 and varies from 26 k at 1 kpc to 16 k at 10 kpc . for e@xmath26-grain heating",
    "the grain temperature @xmath33 k varies as @xmath34 for @xmath35 m where @xmath36 but is independent of grain radius for @xmath37 m where @xmath38 .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated dust temperature profile for the starlight heating and the e@xmath26-grain heating . for ngc 4472",
    "the collisional heating dominates over the radiative heating for grain sizes @xmath39 @xmath0 m .",
    "the infrared emissivity from grains at galactic radius @xmath13 is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the planck function .    the total galactic luminosity at wavelength @xmath15 is @xmath55 and the observed flux at @xmath56 is @xmath57    figure 4 compares the computed far - ir spectra for the cases of stellar radiation heating and collisional heating with the three iso flux upper limits .",
    "the total ir emission ( not shown in the figure ) is the sum of the contribution of the two heating sources for each value of @xmath58 .",
    "grains with an initial mrn distribution having @xmath59 m are consistent with the null observations of ngc4472 in the far - ir .",
    "grains with radii less than about @xmath60 m experience stochastic temperature excursions , but this complication should not greatly change our estimated flux in figure 4 .",
    "we have assumed that the circumstellar dust observed in the mid - ir from ngc4472 ( @xcite ) ultimately becomes interstellar and is exposed to the mean galactic starlight and to bombardment by thermal electrons in the hot @xmath61 kev gas .",
    "grains receive somewhat more energy from electrons than from stellar photons .",
    "the calculated far - ir spectrum peaks at @xmath62 @xmath0 m , a spectral region not accessible to iras , but well covered by iso . however , the computed fluxes are below the observed upper limits if @xmath63 @xmath0 m .",
    "thus the iso upper limits do not strongly constrain the properties of dust in ngc4472 .",
    "we are currently developing a model for the far - ir emission for ngc4636 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this galaxy shows higher far - ir fluxes ( table 1 ) and should allow us to put strong constraints on the origin and the evolution of the intestellar dust .",
