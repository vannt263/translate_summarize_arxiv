    "within the standard picture of ` jet quenching ' in a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) the later materialization of the partonic jets are assumed to take place outside the fireball without any further interactions with the late stage dense hadronic environment .",
    "hence , measurements of jets seem to offer a direct access to probe the early stage when the deconfined matter is very dense .",
    "in fact , the phenix @xcite and star @xcite collaborations have reported a large relative suppression of hadron spectra for transverse momenta @xmath2 above @xmath6 which might point towards the creation of a qgp , since this suppression is not observed in d+au interactions at the same bombarding energy per nucleon @xcite .        on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear presently to which extent this suppression might be due to ordinary hadronic final state interactions ( fsi ) @xcite , too .",
    "we have recently proposed a scenario that ( in-)elastic collisions of ( pre-)hadronic high momentum states with the bulk of hadrons in the late fireball can also contribute significantly to the attenuation of the high transverse momentum hadrons at rhic ( for an illustration see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "the first idea is that most of the ( pre)hadrons stemming from a jet might still materialize in the dense system for transverse momenta up to 10 gev / c .",
    "indeed , the time for color neutralization of the leading particle due to gluon emission can be very small @xcite .",
    "the late hadronic final state interactions with the bulk of comovers then have a clear and nonvanishing effect in suppressing the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this comes about because ( in)elastic reactions of the ( pre-)hadrons with hadrons of the bulk system at the relevant energy scale @xmath4 of a few gev are strong and can not be described by pqcd methods . for a single collision",
    "the momentum degradation can be calculated via the folding equation @xcite @xmath7 in ( 1 ) @xmath8 indicates the probability that from a given particle @xmath9 with transverse momentum @xmath10 one gets a particle @xmath11 with transverse momentum @xmath2 , if the collision is taken with a target @xmath12 at rest .",
    "the folding matrix can be modeled via the fritiof scheme ; typical examples are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fmatr ] .",
    "such ( in-)elastic collisions are very efficient for energy degradation since many hadrons with lower energies are produced . on the average 1 to 2 such interactions can account already quantitatively for the attenuation of high @xmath2 hadrons at rhic @xcite .    hence , the hadronic attenuation has therefore to be addressed in more detail before conclusions on possible qcd effects in a deconfined qgp phase on the materializing jets can be drawn . for a quantitative analysis ( cf .",

    "color - neutral strings are assumed to be formed .",
    "the string ends are defined by the space - time coordinates of the constituents .",
    "these constituent quarks ( or diquarks or antiquarks ) are denoted as leading quarks that constitute the leading pre - hadrons .",
    "the time that is needed for the fragmentation of the strings and for the hadronization of the fragments is denoted as _ formation time _",
    "@xmath16 fm . due to time dilatation",
    "the formation time @xmath17 in any reference frame is then proportional to the lorentz @xmath18-factor .",
    "we assume that hadrons , whose constituent quarks and antiquarks are created from the vacuum in the string fragmentation , do _ not interact _ with the surrounding nuclear medium within their formation time @xmath17 . on the other hand , for the leading pre - hadrons , i.e.  those involving quarks ( antiquarks ) from the struck nucleons , we adopt a reduced effective cross section @xmath19 during the formation time @xmath17 and the full hadronic cross section later on",
    ". as it turns out @xcite , hadrons with transverse momenta larger than @xmath20 predominantly stem from the string ends and therefore can , in principle , interact directly with the reduced cross section ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , when turning to au+au collisions , the formation of secondary hadrons is not only controlled by the formation time @xmath21 , but also by the energy density in the local rest frame , i.e. , hadrons are not allowed to be formed if the energy density is above @xmath22 .",
    "the interaction of the leading and energetic ( pre-)hadrons with the soft hadronic and bulk matter is thus explicitly modeled to occur only for local energy densities below that cut .",

    "is incorporated via an increasing width @xmath26 in the string fragmentation function for a given number of previous collisions @xmath27 .",

[ fig7 ] shows our results for most central ( 5% centrality ) au+au collisions at for the nuclear modification factor @xmath30 we emphasize , that the cronin enhancement is visible at all momenta , but does not show up to be responsible for the peak structure in the enhancement around @xmath31 . as demonstrated in ref .",

    "hadron formation time effects do play a substantial role in the few @xmath32 region since heavier hadrons are formed earlier than light pions in the cms frame at fixed transverse momentum due to the lower lorentz boost .",
    "the interactions of formed hadrons after a formation time @xmath17 are not able to explain the attenuation observed experimentally for transverse momenta @xmath0 . however , the shape of the ratio @xmath33 in transverse momentum @xmath2 reflects the presence of final state interactions of formed hadrons in the @xmath34 range @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour for moderate transverse momentum has also been demonstrated in an exploratory urqmd simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as pointed out before",
    ", the suppression seen in the calculation for larger transverse momentum hadrons is due to the interactions of the leading ( pre-)hadrons with target / projectile nucleons and the bulk of low momentum hadrons . for the most central collisions ,",
    "still , the experimentally observed suppression can not fully be described by the ( pre-)hadronic attenuation of the leading particles .",

    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this observation implies , since more than 3/4 of the high @xmath2 hadrons are strongly absorbed , that the final high @xmath24 hadrons seen experimentally essentially stem from pre  hadrons that originate from a diffuse surface region of the expanding fireball .",
    "the latter pre ",
    "hadrons then evolve ( or fragment ) to the final hadrons dominantly in the vacuum and are accompanied by secondary hadrons , which - due to their large formation time - also hadronize in the vacuum .    in fig .",

    "side correlations are close to the near ",
    "side correlations observed for jet fragmentation in the vacuum .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the far - side correlations we get a @xmath560% reduction , but not a complete disappearance of the far - side jet as indicated by the experimental data @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we point out that ( pre- ) hadronic final state interactions are able to approximately reproduce the high @xmath2 suppression effects observed in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "this finding is important , since the same dynamics also describe the hadron formation and attenuation in deep ",
    "inelastic lepton scattering off nuclei at hermes @xcite appreciably well .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated , that the centrality dependence of the modification factor @xmath33 3 in au+au collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev is well described for peripheral and mid  central collisions on the basis of leading pre - hadron interactions @xcite . on the other hand , the attenuation in central au+au collisions is noticeably underestimated .",
    "a similar situation also holds for an analysis of the far - side correlations , which show a substantial , but not fully complete suppression in central collisions as indicated by the experimental data . from these observations",
    "one should conclude that there are some additional ( and earlier ) interactions of partons in a possibly colored medium that have not been accounted for in our present hsd transport studies .",
    "however , in any case , the final hadronic stage is rather opaque for high transverse momentum and jet - like ( pre-)hadrons .",
    "we note additionally , that the elliptic flow @xmath52 for high transverse momentum particles is underestimated by at least a factor of 3 in our transport calculations @xcite .",
    "moreover , also the experimental observation of having more protons than @xmath53 at moderate transverse momenta can not be explained within the present approach .",
    "this , however , is true also for the various parton jet  quenching models .",
    "we close in pointing out that further experimental studies on the suppression of high momentum hadrons from d+au and au+au collisions down to @xmath4 = 20 gev will be necessary to clearly separate initial state cronin effects from final state attenuation and to disentangle the role of partons in a colored partonic medium from those of interacting pre - hadrons in a color - neutral hot and dense fireball .",
