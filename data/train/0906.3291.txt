    "over the past decade , spatial substructure from tidally disrupted satellites has been discovered in the milky way s stellar spheroid @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that a more detailed accretion history of the milky way can be assembled by including the kinematics of the stars @xcite , since the kinematic signature of each tidally disrupted satellite remains long after the spatial density has become such a small fraction of the stellar halo density that the stream can not be identified from spatial information alone .",
    "recently , @xcite noticed a co - moving population of low metallicity blue horizontal branch stars ( bhbs ) with positions and velocities near , but not coincident with , the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal trailing tidal stream in the south galactic cap , while studying spectra of milky way stars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "the piece of this stream that nearly intersects with the sgr tidal stream is at @xmath2 and at a distance of 34 kpc from the sun , with a line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocity @xmath3 km s@xmath4 and metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath5 -2.0 ( see figures 13 and 17 of yanny et al .",
    "2009b ) . in this paper",
    ", we explore the extent and kinematics of this new stream .",
    "we first identify sdss / segue data release 7 ( dr7 ; abazajian et al . 2009 ) spectra that are likely to be associated with the new stream .",
    "figure 1 shows a color - magnitude diagram of all stellar objects in the south galactic cap with essentially zero proper motion and surface gravities of giant stars .",
    "most of these stars are members of the stellar halo .",
    "circled observations have the velocity and metallicity we expect for the new tidal stream .",
    "sdss / segue data has very complex criteria for selecting the stars for spectroscopic observation , so structure in the distribution of stars in figure 1 is dominated by selection effects . since it is not possible to know the velocity of a star and it is difficult to determine the metallicity of a star before the spectrum is obtained , the selection is blind to these two quantities ; therefore substructure can be identified by looking for regions of figure 1 in which the ratio of circled to uncircled points is high .",
    "the three boxes labeled blue horizontal branch ( bhb ; @xmath6 ) , red giant branch ( rgb ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and lower red giant branch ( lrgb ; @xmath9 ) in figure 1 have a relatively high fraction of stars likely to be in the tidal stream , and comparison with m92 and m3 fiducials @xcite , shifted to 34 kpc , shows that they are also likely to be from the same stellar population . from the bhb fiducials we extracted from the @xcite data and distance moduli from @xcite , we estimate the absolute magnitude of the bhbs in the color range @xmath10 , where most of the bhbs lie , is @xmath11",
    ".    we will later show that this tidal debris stream follows fairly constant galactic longitude , which will justify our current choice of plotting the velocities and apparent magnitudes of the stars as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "the upper panel of figure 2 shows the velocities of stars in the three color - magnitude boxes in figure 1 .",
    "the ones with lower metallicity are circled .",
    "the solid outline identifies stars with velocities of the sgr trailing tidal tail ( compare with law , johnston & majewski 2005 ; yanny et al .",
    "2009b ; @xmath12 ) .",
    "the dashed outline shows velocities of stars in the new stream . at higher galactic latitude we relied primarily on the locus of low metallicity rgbs to select the velocities of stars in the new stream .",
    "the new stream has lower metallicity than those of the sagittarius trailing tidal tail , as demonstrated by the fraction of larger to smaller , point - like symbols within the upper outlined region compared with the lower region with sgr velocities .",
    "we explore the distance to the tidal stream in the lower panel of figure 2 , which shows @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 for the stars in the upper plot that are likely stream members , and photometrically selected bhbs in the region of the newly identified cetus polar stream ( cps ) .",
    "we find an approximately linear relationship between @xmath13 and galactic latitude ( @xmath15 ) in this portion of the stream .",
    "distances were estimated and assuming @xmath11 .",
    "distance estimates are tabulated in table 1 , with only statistical errors included .",
    "distance errors may be systematically too high or too low by 10% , depending on the determination of the absolute magnitude of bhbs @xcite .",
    "the four panels of figure 3 show ( upper left ) an estimate of the positions of the f turnoff stars in the cps , and the positions of the photometrically selected bhb stars ; ( upper right ) the @xmath16 distribution of spectra with colors and magnitudes similar to those in the cps ; ( lower left ) the distribution of f turnoff stars in sgr and the cps , with the stars with cps velocities superimposed ; and ( lower right ) the same f turnoff stars with the stars with sgr stream velocities superimposed .",
    "note that there is an overdensity of photometrically selected bhb stars that lines up with the background - subtracted f turnoff star overdensity , and the cps velocity - selected bhb , rgb , and lrgb stars , running approximately along galactic latitude @xmath17 .",
    "stars that are velocity selected to be candidate sgr stream stars follow a different path in the sky , along the sgr dwarf tidal tail as tabulated in @xcite . although the two streams cross near @xmath1 , they are about @xmath18 apart at @xmath19 .",
    "the lack of significant numbers of colored points at @xmath20 or at @xmath21 ( where the sagittarius stream is located ) gives us confidence that this stream is not an artifact , and is distinct from the previously identified sagittarius trailing tail .",
    "the galactic longitude of the stream center in each of the four sdss stripes 76 , 79 , 82 , and 86 , was estimated by comparing the positions of the f turnoff stars , photometrically selected bhb stars , and velocity - selected bhb , rgb , and lrgb stars .",
    "one sigma errors were also estimated by eye .",
    "the stream centers and estimated errors are given in table 1 .",
    "to estimate the metallicity of the cps we histogramed spectroscopically selected candidate stream stars from figure 3 that have @xmath22 .",
    "the peak of the distribution for bhb , rgb , and lrgb stars is [ fe / h ] @xmath23 .",
    "the formal mean metallicity of the stars is [ fe / h ] @xmath24 .",
    "there is a population of lrgb stars that is higher metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath25 ) . if this population is removed , then the formal mean is [ fe / h ] @xmath26 .",
    "figure 17 of @xcite shows that the bhb stars in the cps are slightly more metal poor than those of the sgr dwarf trailing tidal stream , but both tidal streams may plausibly have a broad distribution of stellar ages and metallicities .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of the cps at four galactic latitudes , shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "in addition to the position , velocity , and distance of the stream as estimated from figures 2 and 3 , we list the approximate velocity dispersion of the line - of - sight velocities ( @xmath27 ) , and the number of spectra at each location . the velocity dispersion for each stripe 76 ,",
    "79 , 82 , and 86 is computed from the spectra with @xmath28 that are shown in the lower left panel of figure 3 , and tabulated in table 1 . since the intrinsic sdss / segue radial velocity errors are about 4 km s@xmath4 , the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the cps is about 4.5 km s@xmath4 in stripes 76 , 82 , and 86 , and about 10 km s@xmath4 in stripe 79 .",
    "the cetus polar stream solves a puzzle long pondered by the authors . in @xcite",
    "we discovered the sgr dwarf tidal tails along the celestial equator , including the trailing tidal tail in stripe 82 .",
    "we have always wondered why , in fig .",
    "3 of that paper , the bhb stars at @xmath29 in the south galactic cap appear offset in position in the sky from the sgr blue straggler ( bs ) stars that are two magnitudes fainter .",
    "the counts of bhb and bs stars , as defined by @xcite , along southern sdss stripes 79 , 82 , and 86 are presented in figure 4 . from this figure",
    ", we determine that many of the sdss bhb stars in the southern stripes that had previously been attributed to the sgr trailing tidal tail are actually in the cps .",
    "the ratio of bs ( higher surface gravity a - colored stars ) to bhb stars varies amongst globular clusters ( i.e. see figures 12 - 16 of an et al . 2008 ) , and can be used as an identifying marker in the halo to help separate two populations with distinct origins or evolutionary histories . from figure 4 , it is clear that the sgr trailing tidal tail has a much larger bs / bhb ratio than the cps .",
    "we fit an orbit to the four cps locations in table 1 , following the procedure used by @xcite and a spherical halo potential ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the average of the best fit orbit from five random starts of the fitting algorithm is shown by the solid black lines in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the formal chi - squared per degree of freedom for this orbit is 1.08 .",
    "varying the halo flattening from 0.3 to 1.25 does not significantly change the goodness - of - fit , and changes the best fit orbit by less than the formal errors .",
    "the cps stars in the lower left panel of figure 3 are spread over quite a range of galactic latitudes ( at least @xmath31 , or @xmath32 kpc ) , which argues in favor of a dwarf galaxy progenitor , though the low velocity dispersion ( @xmath33 km s@xmath4 ) argues for a diminutive dwarf galaxy or possibly a globular cluster .",
    "no known dwarf galaxies lie close to the best fit orbit , but the globular cluster ngc 5824 , at @xmath34 is located within @xmath35 of the orbit , at a very plausibly correct distance , and has a radial velocity that matches the predicted orbit radial velocity within one sigma .",
    "ngc 5824 has a well - populated bhb and a measured [ fe / h]=-1.85 .",
    "ngc 5824 measurements are taken from @xcite .",
    "additionally , the tidal distortion of ngc 5824 measured by @xcite and @xcite is aligned with the cps orbit .",
    "@xcite show that ngc 5824 has a central cusp ; this massive globular cluster could have once been a dwarf galaxy core @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it could be associated with the dwarf galaxy progenitor or be the sole progenitor .",
    "a previously unknown , low metallicity tidal debris stream is identified at @xmath0 and 34 kpc from the sun in the south galactic cap . although it is spatially coincident with the sgr dwarf trailing tidal tail at @xmath1 , the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] = -2.1 ) , ratio of bs / bhb stars , and velocities of the cetus polar stream stars are significantly different .",
    "some bhb stars that have been attributed to the sgr trailing tidal tail by previous authors are instead part of the cps .",
    "both the width of the tidal stream ( @xmath32 kpc ) suggests a dwarf galaxy progenitor , though the velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 km s@xmath4 ) opens the possibility for a globular cluster progenitor .",
    "the globular cluster ngc 5824 is located on the cps orbit with the correct radial velocity , distance , and plausible metallicity .",
    "it is additionally elongated along the orbit .",
    "ngc 5824 could be the progenitor , the core of a dwarf galaxy progenitor , or associated with a dwarf galaxy progenitor .",
    "this stream was discovered from a study of sdss / segue velocities , which allowed us to separate it from the sgr trailing tidal tail even though they intersect spatially .",
