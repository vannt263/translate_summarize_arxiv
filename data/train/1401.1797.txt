    "according to the principles of general relativity ( gr ) , the spacetime is a dynamical object which has independent degrees of freedom , and is governed by dynamical equations , namely the einstein field equations .",
    "this means that in gr the geometry is dynamically determined .",
    "therefore , the construction of a gauge theory of gravity requires an action that does not consider a fixed space - time background .",

    "if chern - simons theories are the appropriate gauge - theories to provide a framework for the gravitational interaction , then these theories must satisfy the correspondence principle , namely they must be related to general relativity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was recently shown that the standard , five - dimensional general relativity ( without a cosmological constant ) can be obtained from chern - simons gravity theory for a certain lie algebra @xmath5 .",
    "the chern - simons lagrangian is built from a @xmath5-valued , one - form gauge connection @xmath6 which depends on a scale parameter @xmath7 which can be interpreted as a coupling constant that characterizes different regimes within the theory .",

    "if we wish to find a spherically - and static - symmetric solution , then we must demand that the three fields satisfy this conditions . since",
    "a static space - time is one which posseses a timelike killing vector orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "these conditions are satisfied by the metric ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "we consider first the fields @xmath3 and @xmath30 ( through @xmath31 ) . in five dimensions the static and spherically symmetric metric",
    "is given by @xmath32where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "one can verify that the parametric lines of the coordinate @xmath38 , i.e. the lines on which the coordinates @xmath100 have constant values , are geodesics .",

    "it follows that the two regions  @xmath101 and @xmath103 do not joint smoothly on the surface @xmath98 .",
    "this can be see in a more striking manner if we consider the radial null directions , on which @xmath104 .",

    "the spherically - and static- symmetric metric is given by@xmath297where @xmath298    introducing an orthonormal basis ( @xmath299 ) : @xmath300 @xmath301    we can use cartan s first structural equation ( @xmath302 ) and the antisymmetry of the connection forms , @xmath40 , to find the non - zero connection forms .",
    "the calculations give:@xmath303    from cartan s second structural equation ( @xmath304 ) we can calculate the curvature matrix .",
    "the non - zero components are@xmath305    introducing ( [ a4 ] ) , ( [ a9 ] ) into ( [ a1.1 ] ) @xmath306    introducing ( [ a10 ] ) into ( [ a1 ] ) and considering the energy - momentum tensor as the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid at rest , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energy density and pressure we find @xmath307      if @xmath83 the field equation are given by @xmath308    consider the equation ( [ a14 ] ) .",
    "after multiplying ( [ a14 ] ) by @xmath309 we find @xmath310 integrating we have @xmath311    adding equations ( [ a15 ] ) and ( [ a16 ] ) we find @xmath312 and equation ( [ a16 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "now consider the equation ( [ a11 ] ) .",
    "after multiplying by @xmath309 we find@xmath313 integrating we have @xmath314 where @xmath54 is an integration constant and @xmath55 is the newtonian mass , which is defined as@xmath315 so that @xmath316 to eliminate the singularity at @xmath112 put @xmath317 then@xmath318      our interest is to compute the pressure and density of matter in a spherically symmetric , static star . since we are assuming spherical symmetry the metric will be of the form ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "let us recall that the energy - momentum tensor satisfies the condition @xmath319    if @xmath46 and @xmath320 we find @xmath321 so that @xmath322 expression known as _ hydrostatic equilibrium equation_.    from ( [ a12 ] ) and ( [ a24 ] ) we find @xmath323 introducing ( [ a26 ] ) into ( [ a27 ] ) we obtain the following equation@xmath324 which is the five - dimensional _ tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff _ equation . compare with the 4-dimensional case shown in equation ( 1.11.13 ) of the reference @xcite .",
    "we can resolve this equation for objects that are isentropic , that is , in which the entropy per nucleon does not vary throughout the it .",
    "for example , we have two very different kinds of star that satisfies this condition : ( i ) _ stars at absolute zero_. according to nernst s theorem , the entropy per nucleon will then be zero throughout the star and ( ii ) _ stars in convective equilibrium_. if the most efficient mechanism for energy transfer within the star is convection , then in equilibrium the entropy per nucleon must be nearly constant throughout the star .",
    "we also assume that the stars we consider have a chemical composition that is constant throughout .    with preceding assumptions ,",
    "the pressure @xmath325 may be expressed as a function of the density @xmath326 , the entropy per nucleon @xmath327 , and the chemical composition .",
    "so , with @xmath327 and the chemical composition constant throughout the star , @xmath49 may be regarded as a function of @xmath48 .    given an equation of state @xmath328 , we now formulate our problem as a pair of first - order differential equations for @xmath49 , @xmath55 and @xmath48 , the equation ( [ a28 ] ) and @xmath329 with an initial condition @xmath330 .",
    "in addition , it is necesary to provide other initial condition , that is , the value @xmath331 .",
    "the differential equations must be integrated out from the center of the star , until @xmath332 drops to zero at some point @xmath333 , which we then interpret as the radius of star .",
    "let us return to the problem of calculating the metric .",
    "once we compute @xmath48 , @xmath55 and @xmath49 , we can immediately obtain @xmath334 from equation ( [ a24 ] ) and @xmath335 from the equation ( [ a27 ] ) @xmath336 where we have set @xmath337 , condition consistent with the asymptotic limit from the exterior solution .",
    "so far we have interpreted the field @xmath11 as a field of matter whose nature has not been specified .",
    "we consider now the field @xmath11 . expanding the field @xmath11 in their holonomic index we have@xmath338    whether the space - time is static and spherically symmetric ,",
    "the field @xmath339 therefore must satisfy the killing equation @xmath340 for @xmath341 ( stationary ) and the six generators of the sphere @xmath342",
    "@xmath343    then , we have@xmath344    from ( [ treintay4 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) and replacing in the second field equation from ( [ 30 - 1 ] ) , we can see that@xmath345 and @xmath346",
    "however @xmath358 has been computed with help from the incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind .",
    "sadly , this way can not get the correct result for input data provided . to solve this problem",
    ", we can separate the non finite part from the integrand , we obtain @xmath359 so that we can immediately integrate to obtain @xmath360 where we define the following smooth function to be computed through numerical methods @xmath361                  you can note there is a minimum value for @xmath38 given by @xmath376{l^2(2r_0 ^ 2-l^2)}=\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{\\kappa_{e}}{6\\pi^2}m}$ ] that satisfies @xmath377 .",
    "so , we can write @xmath378 and separate this way @xmath379 where @xmath380    the calculations gives this results @xmath381 again , we have troubles with the computation of @xmath358 through incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind .",
    "we can use the same procedure from the preceding section .",
