    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extremely successful in describing all the interactions of elementary particles , apart from the gravitational interaction . a candidate for higgs boson , which is the only missing piece in the standard model of electroweak interactions , has been recently discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at the mass between @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the newly discovered boson at lhc is found to behave much like in many ways the standard model higgs particle , though there are a few anomalies in its decay modes such as the enhancement in the two photon channel or the suppression in the @xmath5 channel .    whether the anomalies hint new physics beyond the standard model or not is yet to to be seen .",
    "however , one strongly believes that there should be new physics beyond sm that necessarily contains new particles to explain naturally the unknown component of matter in the universe , dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the successful formation of large scale structures and the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background require a sizable density perturbation of dark matter in the much earlier epoch than the last scattering of photons .",
    "dark matters produced in the early universe survive until today and they show their existence in the several astrophysical phenomena such as galactic rotation curves , gravitational lensing  @xcite . the common solution for the origin of higgs and dark matter may lie in a new physics beyond the standard model",
    ".    models of technicolor ( tc ) theory  @xcite assume a new strong dynamics of new particles , called techni - fermions , at around @xmath6 to break the electroweak symmetry dynamically .",
    "higgs boson is then a bound state , constituted of techni - fermions , below the scale of techni - fermion condensation , induced by the new strong interaction .",
    "tc therefore solves the hierarchy problem naturally .",
    "depending on the tc dynamics , higgs boson could be a broad resonance around @xmath6 just like @xmath7 meson in qcd or a light and narrow bound state  @xcite , difficult to be distinguished from elementary higgs at low energy .",
    "the weak gauge bosons get the masses through higgs mechanism , when the tc becomes strong and techni - fermions condense , breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry spontaneously . for the sm",
    "fermion masses , however , one needs to introduce an additional new interaction , called extended tc ( etc ) interaction  @xcite , mediated by massive particles at some scale @xmath8 , much higher than the electroweak scale , to transmit the techni - fermion condensation to the sm fermions , yielding their masses through the induced yukawa couplings as in the sm  @xcite .    the original tc scenario based on a naive scale - up version of qcd",
    "was excluded : etc scale is required to be at least around @xmath9 - @xmath10  @xcite in order to suppress the induced flavor changing neutral currents between the sm fermions .",
    "compared to the scale of the techni - fermion condensate , such etc scale is , however , too high to generate enough mass to strange and other heavy quarks .",
    "this problem was solved , however , by modifying tc dynamics to be non - qcd like , generating a large anomalous dimension  @xcite for the techni - fermion bilinear @xmath11  @xcite , which enhances the techni - fermion condensate enough to account for sm fermion masses except top quark mass , for which one may introduce other mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the large anomalous dimension @xmath11 can indeed be realized when the tc gauge coupling @xmath12 exhibits almost nonrunning behavior in the chirally broken phase @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the critical coupling for the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the almost nonrunnning behavior actually implies the existence of a ` quasi ' infrared fixed point ( irfp ) , denoted as @xmath15 , known as the caswell - banks - zaks ir fixed point ( cbz - irfp )  @xcite , which is very close to but slightly larger than @xmath16 so that @xmath12 remains almost constant , @xmath17 , exhibiting an approximate scale symmetry for wide range of scales .",
    "but , at scales lower than the dynamical techni - fermion mass ( @xmath18 ) , the techni - fermions decouple and the tc coupling runs quickly toward infinity and confines techni - gluons .",

    "tc with such a ` quasi ' irfp is nowadays termed as walking tc ( wtc )  @xcite .",

    "current lattice simulations support both possibilities  @xcite .",
    "wtc has been shown by several theoretical approaches  @xcite to be compatible with the electroweak precision data and thus serve as a viable framework for physics beyond the sm .    if wtc is a model for new physics at tev , it is desirable to have a candidate for dark matter within the model .",
    "the lightest techni - baryon has been a popular candidate for dark matter  @xcite , since the lightest techni - baryon is absolutely stable up to the nonperturbative anomalous decay just like ordinary qcd baryons",
    ". the techni - baryons could be either fermionic or bosonic , depending on the number of tcs @xmath19 .",
    "this scenario , however , needs an extra mechanism , some like the techni - baryon asymmetry , to account for its abundance in the present universe .",
    "recently another interesting candidate for dark matter is proposed  @xcite : if the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is highly conformal , techni - dilaton ( td ) , the ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone boson , associated with spontaneously broken scale symmetry , is very light and weakly coupled to become a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "when the scale symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the techni - fermion condensation , by goldstone theorem wtc should have a dilaton as a nambu - goldstone boson associated with the scale symmetry . if wtc is extremely conformal , moreover , which can be achieved by adjusting the ` new physics ' such that the intrinsic ultraviolet scale of tc , @xmath20 , lies very close to the ir fixed point or @xmath21 ( see fig .",

    "we begin by defining the decay constant of td , @xmath22 , as @xmath53 or equivalently , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dilatation current and @xmath56 denotes the symmetric part of conserved energy - momentum tensor related to @xmath57 as @xmath58 . because the scale invariance is approximate , the td gets its mass @xmath0 : acting the derivative on the both sides of eq.([ftd : def ] ) or operating @xmath59 in eq.([ftd : def2 ] ) one gets @xmath60 where @xmath61 . assuming the hypothesis of partially conserved dilatation currents ( pcdc ) , we obtain an approximate relation that the divergence of dilatation current is proportional to an interpolating td field , @xmath62 with the td field @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 .",

    "the vacuum energy density contains all the contributions both from tc particles and sm particles . near the quasi ir fixed point , however , the perturbative contributions to the vacuum energy coming from both tc and sm particles are negligible because the beta functions almost vanish . on the other hand , because of the scale anomaly due to non - perturbative beta function , eq .",
    "( [ np ] ) , in the tc sector the vacuum energy gets contributions from the techni - gluon condensation ( see fig .",
    "[ np - vac ] ) : @xmath81        the vacuum energy density @xmath82 has been evaluated in refs .",
    "we here adopt an extremely walking case which is well simulated by nonrunning ( standing ) limit of @xmath83 . the vacuum energy @xmath82 is then calculated through the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis effective potential and is found to be dominated by the techni - fermion loop  @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively stand for the number of tc and that of techni - fermions . combining eq.([cjt ] ) with eq.([pcdc:0 ] ) we finally arrive at a concise pcdc formula , @xmath87 to which we will hereafter refer as the pcdc relation .    since the wtc yields @xmath11 for the techni - fermion bilinear operator @xmath88 , the induced four - fermi operator @xmath89 having @xmath90 becomes marginal as well as the tc gauge coupling @xmath12 in the sense of renormalization group analysis .",
    "the form of scale anomaly , hence the pcdc relation ( [ pcdc ] ) , should then be modified by the presence of the four - fermi interaction . as was briefly noted in sec .",
    "[ wtc ] , such four - fermi effects have been intensively studied through the analysis on the planar qed with nonrunning gauge coupling and four - fermion interactions added ( what is called gauged nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model )  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the vacuum energy density @xmath82 was explicitly computed in the gauged njl model with the nonrunning gauge coupling , so that the result essentially remains the same as in eq.([pcdc ] ) , @xmath91 . even for a perturbatively running case",
    ", it leads to essentially the same result on @xmath82 as that in eq.([pcdc ] )  @xcite within a 5% uncertainty .",
    "this reflects the fact that the mass and coupling of td are tied to the nonperturbative scale anomaly which has nothing to do with how the theory is perturbatively ( fully or almost ) scale invariant , as long as the dynamical fermion mass is generated in accord with  la miransky scaling ( [ miransky ] ) .",
    "following the standard procedure as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive the yukawa couplings between fermions and td arising from the techni - fermion condensation and etc contributions .",

    "the issue on the fermion mass generation is beyond the scope of this paper to be explored elsewhere .",

    "the forms of their potentials are thus quite different so could be testable at some future collider experiments having high luminosity .",

    "the couplings of composite higgs to the sm fermions and the longitudinal components of the @xmath119 and @xmath170 bosons are same as those of elementary sm higgs , since tc is constructed such that . however , its couplings to photons and gluons will be model - dependent",

    "come from the @xmath119 boson loop .",
    "but , in tc we do not know how big is @xmath176 , not to mention its sign . since the @xmath177 function of technicolor is small for wtc models , one may use the ladder approximation in calculating the tc contributions to the higgs coupling , neglecting the vertex corrections , which is tantamount to having massive techni - fermions in the loop for low external momenta .",

    "the most severe constraint would then come from neutron star cooling to give a lower bound on @xmath22 , @xmath407 .",
    "one can see , however , that this constraint is well satisfied if the lifetime of td is long enough for td to be a dark matter as in  eq .",
    "( [ lifetime ] ) : indeed , it just places a weaker upper bound on the td mass , @xmath408 , in contrast to the case of axion , which is due to the discrepancy between their energy densities , namely , @xmath409 and @xmath410 .",
    "since the light decoupled td has the extremely large decay constant @xmath411 gev and its lifetime has to be @xmath412s to be consistent with x - ray observation ( see fig .  [ xrb_td ] ) , it is unlikely that the td dark matter can be detected at collider experiments as in the case of invisible axions .",

    "the td detection experiments can be performed associated with the td - photon conversion , in a way similar to the axion case  @xcite : from eq .",
    "( [ gaugeint : anomalous ] ) the td coupling to two photons are read off as @xmath415 where @xmath416 and @xmath417 .",
    "this coupling is similar to that of axion except the essential fact that axion is a pseudo scalar and hence couples to photon via @xmath418 .",
    "one possible example of td detection experiments is the following : cosmic tds left over from the big bang may be detected using microwave cavity haloscopes similar to the axion case  @xcite .",
    "the tds drift through the microwave cavity in a strong static magnetic field and resonantly convert to microwave photons according to eq .",
    "( [ dgg ] ) .",
    "since td is a scalar particle , they will convert their energy into a te mode ( magnetic wave ) in the cavity .",

    "( [ power ] ) then reads @xmath429 this power is comparable to that of axion and it might be possible to detect cosmological tds in the cavity experiment with appropriate experimental device .",
    "to summarize , this paper explored a new dark matter candidate , light decoupled td , arising as a pseudo nambu goldstone boson in the almost conformal dynamics of wtc possessing the approximate scale invariance . the extremely wtc allows td to be extremely light with mass much smaller than the techni - fermion mass scale and its decay constant comparable with the cutoff scale of wtc .",
    "the light decoupled td was studied in detail explicitly by discussing cosmological productions of td , thermal and non - thermal productions , in the early universe .",
    "the thermal population is governed by single td production processes involving vertices breaking the scale symmetry ( see figs .  [",
    "leading - graphs - td ] and [ td - production ] ) , while the non - thermal population is accumulated via harmonic and coherent oscillations of classical td field similarly to cold axion dark matter case ( figs .",
    "[ ntp - contour ] ) .",
    "it was shown that the non - thermal population is dominant and large enough to explain the abundance of presently observed dark matter ( fig.[ntp - contour ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the thermal td population tends to be highly suppressed due to the large td decay constant ( fig .",
    "[ mf - mtd - tp ] ) .",
    "it was also clarified that several cosmological and astrophysical observations constrain the mass @xmath0 to be in a range , @xmath2 ev ( see figs .  [ geraci_td ] and [ xrb_td ] ) .",
    "the combined result of two cosmological productions including those constraints drew a conclusion that the light decoupled td can be a good candidate for dark matter with the mass around a few hundreds of ev for a typical model of wtc ( fig .",
