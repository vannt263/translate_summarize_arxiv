    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy is a powerful method for contemporary molecular characterization and diagnostics due to a superb spectroscopic resolution . by contrast , the sensitivity of nmr is low due to its reliance on the boltzmann polarization , which is @xmath0 even for the highest fields accessible with state - of - the - art superconducting magnets @xcite .",
    "the low sensitivity posits that a sufficiently large sample volume in high enough concentration is available , which presents a significant obstacle when delicate samples and nuclei with a low isotope abundance or low gyromagnetic ratio are involved . in order to circumvent the sensitivity limitations of nmr , hyperpolarization techniques that increase the polarization beyond the boltzmann level",
    " ideally approaching 100% polarization  are being widely explored . in particular , these include triplet dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) @xcite , dissolution dnp @xcite , optically pumped noble gases @xcite and semiconductors @xcite , and many varieties of those techniques @xcite .",
    "the main drawbacks of most hyperpolarization methods are a cost - expensive cryogenic hardware and an often - limited area of application .    a new concept for an inexpensive , room temperature polarizer is based on diamond crystals doped with nitrogen - vacancy defects ( nv centers ) @xcite . in a diamond polarizer",
    ", hyperpolarization is induced by optical pumping of nv defect spins using intense laser illumination .",
    "diamond polarizers are proposed to have many advantages , which include beside the room - temperature compatibility , rapid optical pumping , near - unity polarization , and no need for sample doping by radicals .",
    "in addition , the chemical inertness and stability of diamond makes the device potentially reusable for a large variety of liquid samples .",
    "the central bottleneck of diamond polarizers , however , is the transport of polarization from the defect spins within diamond to target spins outside of diamond .",
    "this step has to date only been demonstrated indirectly and on a few - spin scale @xcite . because the separation between source and target nuclear spins must be less than @xmath1",
    ", only defect centers located in the top surface layer contribute to the transfer .",
    "thus , even for high nv densities of order @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) @xcite the number of actively participating spins is low .",
    "one proposed remedy is to structure the surface so as to increase its effective surface area @xcite .",
    "another potential route for increasing hyperpolarization efficiency , explored here , takes advantage of abundant substitutional nitrogen defects ( p1 centers ) @xcite . rather than directly polarizing an outside analyte ,",
    "the polarization is first transferred to the large bath of nitrogen donor spins using a cross - relaxation process ( see fig . [",
    "fig : arrangement ] ) . since p1 centers can approach densities of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , the electronic spin polarization at the diamond surface can potentially be greatly increased .",
    "in addition , because p1 centers , in contrast to nv centers , do not require a preferential alignment with the external bias field , they are more suited for transferring polarization to outside nuclear spins .    in this paper , we investigate hyperpolarization of nitrogen donor spins in bulk diamond by _ in situ _ electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy .",
    "the hyperpolarization is induced by optical pumping of nv centers and cross - relaxation at the energy level matching of the two spin species at @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : arrangement]b ) .",
    "we observe that large polarization enhancement factors , exceeding 100 for nv centers and up to 25 for p1 centers , can be generated . in addition , we observe that the polarization enhancement unexpectedly saturates already at very low laser intensities , and far below the known saturation intensity for nv centers . by comparing the results to a kinetic model of spin populations we find that the anomalous saturation can be partially explained by charge state conversions of nv and p1 defects . to our knowledge , this study is the first demonstration of nitrogen donor hyperpolarization in the bulk .    ,",

    "next , the polarization is transferred to adjacent nitrogen defects ( @xmath9 , blue , spin @xmath10 ) using cross - relaxation mediated by the dipolar interaction ( solid arrows ) . only those @xmath11 centers whose symmetry axis is aligned with the external bias field ( @xmath12 $ ] ) are optically pumped and contribute to cross - relaxation .",
    "finally , the polarization is rapidly distributed in the nitrogen spin bath via spin diffusion ( dashed arrows ) .",
    "the polarization may later be transferred to target nuclear spins outside the diamond chip .",
    "this could be achieved either directly , using the integrated solid effect @xcite or the overhauser effect @xcite , or indirectly , via additional spin labels on the diamond surface @xcite or in the analyte .",

    "although the relaxation between the @xmath85 states is likely much slower , the assumption of equal relaxation rates allows for a simple analysis .",

    "we find that the model well describes the polarization enhancement of both spin species at low laser intensities , but that it can not account for the saturation observed for intensities above roughly @xmath65 .          in a second step",
    "we analyze whether charge state conversion processes between @xmath11 and neutral @xmath74 as well as between @xmath9 and ionized @xmath75 , which are known to be promoted by laser illumination @xcite , can be responsible for the anomalous saturation .",
    "charge state conversions work to reduce the absolute epr signal intensity through two effects .",
    "first , a significant accumulation of @xmath74 and @xmath75 depletes the sizes of the spin reservoirs .",

    "instead , we assume that the conversion from @xmath88 occurs via electron tunneling from a photo - excited @xmath11 to a nearby @xmath75 , and the reconversion via electron capture from the conduction band @xcite .",
    "the conversion between @xmath9 and @xmath75 is assumed to occur via a simple one - photon ionization and recombination process @xcite .    to account for charge state conversions we extend the model by the following four rate equations , @xmath89 where @xmath90 through @xmath91 are rate constants and @xmath92}/{[{\\mathrm{nv^-}}]}=r/4 $ ] ( because all nv orientations participate in charge transfer ) .",

    "a first case only takes @xmath63 charge state conversions into account but neglects @xmath64 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the second scenario includes both types of charge state conversions .",
    "because the rate constants @xmath90 through @xmath91 are not well known , we have tried a number of different parameter settings in order to best match the model to our data .",
    "the best effort result is given in table [ tab : model ] and the corresponding model curves are plotted as curves 3 and 4 in fig .",

    "we find that the extended model visibly improves the agreement with the experiment , and that both charge state conversion processes must be included to obtain a satisfactory agreement .",
    "the charge recombination rates that best match our experimental data are , however , much lower than the ones found in recent optical spectroscopy experiments @xcite . in addition",
    ", a significant discrepancy clearly remains for laser intensities above @xmath65 .",

    "while more work will be needed to explain the anomalous saturation behavior , we note that the effect could be accounted for by deep trap states formed by additional defects in the diamond crystals .",
    "these trap states would act as sinks and slowly deprive nv and p1 centers of their electrons . in order to be effective",
    ", the trap states would need to lie far below the conduction band so that they can not be excited by green laser illumination .",
    "there are several defects that could act as such trap states , such as di - vacancies formed during electron irradiation @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for a trap state hypothesis comes through recent photoconductivity measurement made by chen @xcite .",
    "there , an unexpected quenching of pulsed photocurrents by low - intensity laser illumination was observed .",

    "this would lead to a concurrent reduction of @xmath11 .",
    "chen  also observed that short , intense laser pulses could replenish the @xmath9 reservoir .",
    "pulsed laser excitation may therefore provide a means for also mitigating the anomalous saturation effect .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have demonstrated a method for polarizing nitrogen donors in bulk diamond through optical pumping of nv centers and cross relaxation . the polarization transfer between nv centers and nitrogen donors",
