    "a very interesting class of nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) is composed of a mesoscopic conductor , such as a quantum dot , point contact , or single electron transistor , coupled electrostatically to a nanomechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "such devices have potentially important applications as ultra - sensitive measuring devices  @xcite , as well as being interesting dynamical systems in their own right .",
    "a question of particular interest for these systems is under what circumstances the mechanical degrees of freedom require quantum mechanics for their proper description .",
    "when a resonator is coupled electrostatically to a mesoscopic conductor as a mechanically compliant voltage - gate , the position of the resonator affects the current flowing through the conductor and hence the latter can be used to monitor the motion of the resonator .",
    "however , the movement of electrons through the conductor necessarily acts back on the resonator affecting its dynamics in important ways . for weak electro - mechanical coupling ,",
    "the back - action of the conductor on the resonator is typically analogous to an equilibrium thermal bath  @xcite .",
    "the stochastic motion of electrons through the conductor gives rise to a force on the resonator which leads to fluctuations in its state that can be described by an effective temperature .",
    "furthermore , the conductor can also damp the oscillations of the resonator , so that it reaches a thermal - like steady state .",
    "the damping and heating effects of a conductor on a nearby nanomechanical resonator were first reported by mozyrsky and martin  @xcite who examined the quantum dynamics of a resonator coupled to a quantum point contact ( qpc ) . in this device",
    "@xcite the tunnelling matrix elements of a tunnel junction depend linearly on the resonator position .",
    "the back - action of the qpc on the resonator was obtained by tracing over all the electronic degrees of freedom to derive a reduced density matrix for the resonator .",
    "the resulting resonator master equation was found to be of the caldeira ",
    "leggett form and hence an effective temperature and damping constant arising from the back - action of the electrons could be ascribed to the resonator .",
    "the dynamics of a resonator coupled to a single electron transistor ( set ) has also been studied theoretically  @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "electrons tunnel sequentially through a metallic island or quantum dot gated by a mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "a classical master equation description of this system was proposed for this system in @xcite and it was found that the resonator dynamics could be described by a fokker - planck equation  @xcite with the set electrons again acting like a thermal bath . however , apart from weak electro - mechanical coupling , it was also assumed that the resonator moved very slowly on the time - scale of the electron tunnelling time and that the energy associated with the set bias voltage was much greater than the resonator quanta .",
    "a subsequent quantum mechanical study of the closely related system of a resonator coupled to a quantum dot  @xcite also showed that the back - action of the electrons could give rise to resonator damping , even without assuming a slow resonator or very high bias voltage , but with a very different rate to that found in the classical study .    in this paper",
    ", we begin from a microscopic description of the set - resonator system and proceed to derive reduced master equations which describe the dynamics of the resonator alone . by first tracing over the microscopic electronic levels , we obtain a master equation which describes both the resonator and the excess charge on the set island .",
    "we show that although this master equation is essentially equivalent to that proposed in the classical description  @xcite , it can nevertheless be used to investigate the interesting question of what happens when the resonator period matches the electronic tunnelling time . by solving equations of motion for the resonator moments",
    ", we find that the resonator is damped and reaches a thermal - like steady state even when the resonator period is of order or less than the electron tunnelling time , with maximum damping occuring when the electrical and mechanical time - scales are equal .",
    "having obtained a master equation describing the set island charge and resonator , we then go on to derive , via different approximations , two reduced master equations for the resonator alone . although the two reduced master equations have differences in form , we find that ( within their domains of validity ) they both lead to a description of the resonator dynamics which closely matches that obtained from the master equation for the resonator and set island charge . in this framework ,",
    "the two different expressions for the resonator damping obtained before in quantum  @xcite and classical treatments  @xcite emerge naturally as limiting values for the cases where the average tunnelling rate of the electrons is much less than the resonator frequency , and the opposite case where the resonator frequency is much smaller than the tunnel rate , respectively .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : meqn ]",
    "we outline the details of the nanomechanical - set system we consider and derive a master equation which describes the dynamics of the resonator and the excess charge on the set island for weak electro - mechanical coupling . in section [ sec : numresults ] , we obtain equations of motion for the charge and resonator moments and hence explore how the resonator dynamics depends on important parameters such as the ratio of the relevant electrical and mechanical time - scales . then , in section [ sec : cl ] , we trace over the set island charge to derive a reduced master equation for the resonator alone , and compare the resulting resonator dynamics with that obtained in the previous section .",
    "next , in section [ sec : rwa ] , we use a rotating wave approximation to obtain an alternative reduced master equation for the resonator which is valid in the limit where the resonator frequency is much higher than the electron tunnelling rate .",
    "again we compare the resonator dynamics predicted by this equation with the results of previous sections .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions and a brief discussion of our results .",
    "the appendices contain more details on certain aspects of the calculations .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator - set system we consider is shown schematically in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the set consists of a metallic island , with total capacitance @xmath0 , connected via tunnel junctions to two leads , with a bias voltage @xmath1 applied across it .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator is adjacent to the set island and is coated with a metal layer so that it forms a mechanically compliant voltage gate to which a voltage @xmath2 is applied .",
    "motion of the resonator modulates the gate capacitance and hence the charging energy of the set island , while changes in the charge on the set island modulate the equilibrium position of the resonator .",
    "the resonator has a mass @xmath3 and is treated as a single - mode harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath4 .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the effect of the set on the resonator and hence do not include any other influences on the resonator s dynamics in our description .    because the set is metallic , the island as well as the source and drain leads contain many ( microscopic ) electron energy levels .",
    "the source ( drain ) lead has energy levels @xmath5 and a chemical potential @xmath6 .",
    "the island has energy levels @xmath7 and we set its chemical potential to zero for simplicity .",
    "the resistances of the tunnel junctions , @xmath8 , are taken to be much larger than the quantum resistance , @xmath9 , so we can neglect higher order processes such as co - tunnelling  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the resonator is affected by the overall charge on the set island , rather than the details of which of the microscopic electron levels are occupied , hence we introduce the macroscopic charge operator , @xmath10 , for the total number of excess electrons on the set island . using this macroscopic charge variable",
    ", we can integrate over the microscopic electronic states , whilst still keeping track of the overall island charge  @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath11 , conjugate to @xmath10 , can be used to form the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 which increase and decrease the overall charge on the island respectively .",
    "the overall electrostatic energy of the set island is determined not just by the island charge , but also by the gate voltage ( which we write in dimensionless units as @xmath14 ) and the position of the resonator .",
    "we assume that the electro - mechanical coupling is weak , as has been the case in recent experiments  @xcite , and hence we consider only linear coupling between the set island charge and the resonator position  @xcite .",
    "bearing these details in mind , we write the hamiltonian for this system as  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the charging energy of the set island , @xmath17 is the resonator annihilation operator , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the annihilation operators acting on the electron levels in the two leads and the island of the set respectively , and @xmath20 are the tunnelling matrix elements between the microscopic states in the leads and the set island . the coupling between the set island charge and the resonator is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the shift in the equilibrium position of the resonator when an electron is added to the island ( which in turn depends on details such as the gate capacitance and voltage as well as the resonator - island separation  @xcite ) , and @xmath23 is the zero - point position uncertainty of the resonator  @xcite .    assuming that the charging energy of the set island , @xmath24 , is much greater than the thermal energy of the electrons , and that the drain - source voltage is not too large ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) , then only the two consecutive charge states @xmath26 closest to @xmath14 will be involved in the dynamics of the system . in what follows",
    "we will restrict the charge state basis to just these two states , and introduce the convenient operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "choosing the origin of the resonator s position coordinate so that @xmath30 corresponds to the equilibrium position when there are @xmath31 electrons on the set island , then the effective electrostatic energy of the set can then be written ( discarding constants ) as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 ranges from 0 to 1 and determines the difference in electrostatic energy of the two charge states .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( equation [ h1 ] ) is , apart from the leads , essentially that of the independent boson model@xcite and hence we make the canonical transformation usually applied to such systems to eliminate the term in the hamiltonian describing the set - resonator coupling .",

    ". of particular interest is the effect of varying the ratio of electrical and mechanical time - scales , @xmath101 , as only the regime @xmath102 was described for classical treatments of the system  @xcite .",

    "the average resonator position shows a clear initial transient before decaying exponentially as if it were a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the average set island charge , @xmath104 , relaxes on two time - scales : initially , the charge relaxes rapidly towards its steady state value over a time @xmath106 , it then undergoes weak oscillations ( following those of the resonator ) which are damped out slowly .",
    "although the dynamics of the resonator is qualitatively the same for the whole range of parameters we have studied , there are important quantitative differences . in figures [ fig : universal ] and [ fig : univ_freq ] we plot the damping rate and frequency shift ( extracted from fits to the average resonator position as a function of time ) for different choices of @xmath107 , @xmath63 and for a wide range of @xmath108 values .",
    "strikingly , we find that the data all fall very close to universal curves . when time is measured in units of the resonator period , the form of the universal curves for damping and frequency shift are determined by @xmath108 and @xmath109 which gives a measure of the set - resonator coupling strength compared to to the bias voltage .",
    "as we shall see later on , the universal curves emerge naturally from a reduced master equation for the resonator .    from figure",
    "[ fig : universal ] , we can see that the damping rate reaches a maximum when the resonator period matches the tunnelling rate , and drops to zero when the tunnelling rate is either much faster or much slower than the oscillator .",
    "we also note that the damping rate is proportional to @xmath108 for @xmath98 and inversely proportional for @xmath102 , with the latter matching the results obtained in previous classical treatments of the system  @xcite while the former is consistent with results found using a quantum treatment in @xcite .",
    "the frequency shift follows a different pattern , increasing monotonically with @xmath108 until saturating at a constant value for @xmath110 .",
    "physically , the frequency shift and damping of the resonator arise because the charge on the set is a function of both the resonator position and ( indirectly ) velocity and the resonator in turn experiences a force proportional to the charge on the resonator .",
    "thus the resonator - set coupling results in forces on the resonator proportional to its position ( frequency shift ) and to its velocity ( damping ) @xcite .",
    "the velocity dependent term is due to the fact that the set takes a finite amount of time to respond to the resonator .",
    "if the set responds instantly ( which is equivalent to taking the limit @xmath111 , ) there is no damping .",
    "conversely , if the set takes an essentially infinite amount of time to respond to the resonator position ( i.e.  in the limit @xmath112 ) , then the damping must also disappear .",
    "the second moments of the resonator can also be calculated from equation [ eq : cmeqn ] , and solved to find the steady state variances of the resonator .",

    "note that these expressions for the steady state variances are not valid for arbitrarily small voltages ( and hence do not violate the uncertainty relations ) as they were derived assuming a bias voltage large enough to ensure that no back - tunnelling occurs .",
    "specifically , equation ( [ eq : variances ] ) is valid for @xmath118 ) and @xmath119 , and for weak electro - mechanical coupling .",
    "in section [ sec : meqn ] we traced over the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom to obtain a master equation for a system consisting of the resonator and the macroscopic charge of the set island .",
    "a natural further step is to trace over the remaining electronic degree of freedom and hence obtain a reduced master equation for the resonator alone  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this reduced master equation is that it gives a compact description of the resonator dynamics and makes clear the analogy between the effect of the set electrons and a thermal bath .    in order to trace over the macroscopic charge variable",
    ", we treat the set as the bath and make many of the same kinds of assumptions as were used in deriving equation ( [ eq : cmeqn ] ) ( details of the calculation are given in [ app : cl ] ) . in particular , we assume that the tunnelling rate , @xmath120 , is fast compared to the rate of change of the resonator s reduced density matrix in the interaction picture ( markov approximation ) . whilst we can not be completely sure when such an approximation is valid before carrying out the calculation , we can judge its validity by comparing the predictions of the resulting master equation with those of equation ( [ eq : cmeqn ] ) described in the previous section .",
    "it is also necessary to assume that the coupling is weak compared to the bias voltage ( born approximation ) , @xmath121 , but this is not restrictive given the weak - coupling assumption used in the derivation of equation ( [ eq : cmeqn ] ) .",

    "such differences must be interpreted as artifacts of our born - markov approximations . however , in the limit @xmath130 these values converge to the same limits as before .",
    "having compared the steady state properties of the resonator given by the reduced master equation with the ` true ' values given by the master equation for the resonator and set island charge , we now compare the dynamics . in figures [ fig : universal ] and [ fig : univ_freq ] we plot the analytic caldeira - leggett values of frequency shift and damping [ equations ( [ eq : freqcl ] ) and ( [ eq : gamacl ] ) ] together with values extracted from numerical integrations of the full master equation .",
    "the analytic results match up very well with the numerics in the weak electro - mechanical coupling limit .",
    "furthermore , this good agreement extends over the whole range of @xmath108 showing that our markov approximation remains valid even for @xmath131 .",
    "although the reduced master equation successfully describes the long - time dynamics of the resonator , it fails to capture certain transient features which are present in the numerics over time - scales of order the electron tunnelling time , @xmath120 . in figure",
    "[ fig : transient ] we compare the time evolution of the moments calculated from equation ( [ eq : cl ] ) to those obtained from the full master equation . in order to match the long time behaviour of the numerics",
    "we have had to ` slip ' the initial conditions for the reduced master equation  @xcite .",
    "the failure of a reduced master equation to capture transient features in the motion of the system is often a consequence of markov approximations used in their derivation  @xcite , and it seems very likely that the same has happened here .",
    "an additional factor that may introduce further complications is the presence of an external bath , which has been neglected in this treatment .",
    "while naively we might expect that a thermal environment could simply be incorporated into the reduced master equation of the resonator ( equation [ eq : cl ] ) by the addition of further caldeira - leggett type terms  @xcite , the correlation time of the environment provides an additional timescale which might affect the validity of the assumptions used in deriving the reduced master equation in the first place  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed treatment would therefore required , for instance including the environment at a more microscopic level as a bath of harmonic oscillators in the original hamiltonian of the system .",

    "it is clear that although the fixed point value of @xmath104 remains the same , the dynamics is different as it no longer displays oscillations correlated to the resonator motion .    assuming that the density matrix factorises into charge and resonator parts , the evolution of the resonator alone is given by a reduced master equation which has the lindblad form @xmath138 \\bar{\\rho}_{r , i } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g \\lambda^2 \\left\\ { { { \\langle n \\rangle } } ( e_s - e_d ) + ( e_d+\\hbar\\omega_0 ) \\right\\ } \\mathcal{f}[a , a^\\dag ] \\bar{\\rho}_{r , i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 the average charge appears in equation ( [ eq : qmeq2 ] ) as a parameter though it is not necessary to assume that @xmath104 has reached its fixed point value .",
    "instead , we can use the solution of equation ( [ avn ] ) to obtain a reduced master equation for the resonator capable of capturing transient behaviour arising from different initial conditions , albeit one with time dependent coefficients .",
    "the decoupling between the occupancy of the set island and the resonator motion occurs because we are working in the limit where the resonator oscillations are much faster than the time - scale for electron tunnelling events and hence the set only experiences the average of the resonator position .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this decoupling only occurs in the strict rwa limit , i.e.@xmath112 : for any non - zero values of @xmath108 there is a residual correlation between the resonator motion and the average charge .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath104 [ obtained from equations ( [ eq : nmoment])-([eq : pmoment ] ) ] shown in figure [ fig : transient ] , for which we set @xmath105 , clearly follow those of the average resonator position , but this behaviour disappears completely in the rwa limit .",
    "equations of motion for the moments of the resonator are readily obtained from equation ( [ eq : qmeq2 ] ) or from equation ( [ eq : qmeqn ] ) , @xmath140 in order to capture the long - time dynamics of the resonator as simply as possible , it is sufficient to assume that the average island charge has reached its steady state values .",
    "we can then obtain the following equation of motion for the resonator position about its fixed point value , @xmath141 where we have discarded terms @xmath142 and higher . from this equations",
    "it is clear that the resonator is damped at a uniform rate @xmath143 , but there is no shift in its frequency .",

    "fig : transient ] we compare the rwa evolution of the system moments with the full case .",
    "we see that the agreement is very close , including the short - time transient , for the value @xmath105 used and in fact it becomes exact in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "the rwa values for the damping and temperature , ( and the absence of a frequency shift ) are consistent with those calculated from equations ( [ eq : meqn ] ) and ( [ eq : cmeqn ] ) in the limit @xmath98 , as can be clearly seen from figures [ fig : universal ] and [ fig : univ_freq ] .",
    "this implies that the correct criteria for the validity of the rotating wave approximation in this system is @xmath98 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of just a harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath  @xcite , where the criteria for the validity of the rwa is simply that the resonator frequency should be much larger than the damping rate due to the bath .",
    "it is clear that the presence of the set in our system introduces an additional time - scale over which @xmath133 evolves and hence the period of the resonator oscillations must be much shorter than both the damping time and the electron tunnelling time for the rwa approximation to be valid .",
    "it is worth noting that equation [ eq : qmeqn ] seems to suggest that the damping is caused by terms like @xmath146\\bar{\\rho}_i$ ] which add or remove an energy quantum from the resonator during a tunnelling event ( for discussions of energy exchange in similar master equations see  @xcite ) .",
    "although this mechanism seems intrinsically quantum mechanical , involving the exchange of energy in units of @xmath147 , the rwa master equation was derived from an equation describing essentially classical behaviour .",
    "however , we must remember that the equation we have derived is an _ unconditional _ master equation . even though the terms in equation  [ eq : qmeqn ] describe the transfer of individual quanta",
    ", the fact we are considering an ensemble of systems means that the density matrix changes continuously . a full description of damping that proceeds by transfer of discrete units of @xmath147 ( as equation  [ eq : qmeqn ] seems to imply ) would require quantum trajectory methods  @xcite .",
    "starting from a microscopic formulation , we have derived a quantum master equation for the set - resonator system which describes the coupled dynamics of the set island charge and the resonator in the limit of weak electro - mechanical coupling and intermediate voltages ( i.e.  @xmath148 ) . by investigating the dynamics of the charge and resonator moments",
    "we find that the resonator is damped , undergoes a shift in frequency and eventually reaches a thermal - like steady state .",
    "these results agree with those found in a classical description of the same problem  @xcite , but are more general .",
    "in particular , we find that the resonator is damped by the set even when the electron tunnelling time is of order the resonator period or longer . furthermore ,",
    "maximum damping of the resonator by the set electrons occurs when the electron tunnelling time matches the resonator period .",
    "starting with the resonator - island charge master equation , we have derived reduced master equations for the resonator alone in two different ways .",
    "the first reduced master equation is very similar to the caldeira - leggett master equation and is obtained by tracing over the island charge , treating it like an external bath ( i.e.making born - markov approximations ) .",
    "the second type of reduced master equation is found by making the rotating wave approximation so that the charge dynamics decouples from the resonator motion .",
    "apart from an initial transient , the caldeira - leggett type master equation describes the long - time dynamics of the resonator faithfully over the whole range of relative electrical and mechanical time scales .",
    "in contrast , the master equation obtained via the rotating wave approximation only captures the resonator dynamics when its period is much shorter than the electron tunnelling time , though unlike the caldeira - leggett master equation it captures the transient motion and is of the lindblad form so is guaranteed to preserve the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "the derivation of a reduced master equation for the resonator in the set - resonator system makes an interesting comparison with better known dissipative systems as it proceeds via a two stage process : tracing over the microscopic electronic levels gives rise to a master equation which still contains the set island charge , and further approximations are needed to obtain a description of the resonator alone .",
    "this is in contrast to other nems such as the resonator - point contact system  @xcite where tracing over the microscopic electronic states leads directly to a caldeira - leggett type master equation for the resonator .",
    "however , the intermediate stage for the set - resonator system ( consisting of a master equation for the resonator and set island charge ) leads rather fortuitously to closed sets of equations of motion for the resonator and charge moments .",
    "thus it is possible to characterize the dynamics of the resonator using simple numerical and analytical techniques before making the additional approximations required to obtain the reduced master equations of the resonator .",
    "thus we are able to show that the anomalous diffusion term which arises in the caldeira - leggett type reduced master equation is not a feature of the ` true ' resonator dynamics , but rather an artifact of the approximations we make .",
    "the quantum master equations we derive here for the set - resonator system will provide useful tools for further investigations into the quantum dynamics of this system . in particular , we can use them as a starting point for investigations of how an individual set and resonator ( rather than an ensemble of such systems ) evolves . however , it will also be interesting to try to extend the ensemble - averaged master equations derived here to obtain descriptions of the low - bias and strong - coupling regimes where the close connection between quantum and classical treatments found here is unlikely to persist",
