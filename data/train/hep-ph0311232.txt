    "as it is well known , fundamental aspects and principles of quantum mechanics can be conveniently illustrated by the basic double  slit experiment @xcite . in order to do this ,",
    "one usually explores the consequences of the complementarity relation existing between the observation of interference fringes , conventionally associated to wave  like behaviour , and the acquisition of `` which way '' or _ welcher weg _ information , similarly associated to particle  like behaviour .    in a double  slit  like experiment ,",
    "interference patterns are observed if and only if it is impossible to know , _ even in principle _ , which path the particle took .",
    "interference disappears if there is a way to know e.g .",
    ", through a _ quantum marking",
    "_ procedure which path the particle took ; whether or not the outcome of the corresponding `` which way '' observation is actually read out , it is completely irrelevant : information is there and interference is in any way lost .",
    "but , if that `` which way '' mark is erased by means of a suitable measurement _quantum erasure _ @xcite , interferences can be somehow restored .",
    "the acquisition of `` which way '' information in an interferometric device is always accompanied by a reduction of the interference fringe visibility .",
    "this well known , _ qualitative _ observation has been recently translated into modern and _ quantitative _ expressions of bohr s complementarity @xcite .",
    "these quantitative complementarity expressions , as well as the quantum eraser effect , have been investigated and confirmed in a variety of recent interferometric experiments with atoms @xcite or photon pairs @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to extend these considerations , quantitative complementarity ( or duality ) and quantum erasure , to neutral kaons .",
    "this is possible because a clear analogy exists between the neutral kaon propagation in free ",
    "space and the propagation of an interfering object in a double  slit experiment .",
    "indeed , a neutral kaon beam presents the long known phenomenon of @xmath2@xmath3 oscillations , which play the role of the interference fringes in a two  way interferometer experiment .",
    "similarly , the short and long  lived kaon states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , being characterized by remarkably different decay widths ( @xmath4 ) and distinct propagation in free ",
    "space , are the analogs of the two separated particle trajectories in interferometric devices .",
    "therefore , the better one can know if the propagation proceeds through the @xmath0 or @xmath1 component i.e .",
    ", the more `` _ _ which width _ _ '' information one can have , the less pronounced will be the @xmath0@xmath1 interference and the visibility of the @xmath2@xmath3 oscillations .",
    "for single neutral kaons we deduce a generalized version of the quantitative statement for complementarity proposed by greenberger and yasin @xcite ( sec .",
    "iii.a ) . using instead entangled kaon pairs , another quantitative duality statement by englert @xcite and other authors @xcite is illustrated in sec .",
    "scully s quantum eraser @xcite for the neutral kaon system is discussed in sec .",
    "two alternative bases , each one associated to a possible measurement , have to be considered for these neutral kaon analyses @xcite . the strangeness basis , @xmath5 with @xmath6 , is the appropriate one to discuss strong production and reactions of kaons , as well as kaon strangeness measurements .",
    "the latter are performed by inserting along the kaon trajectory a piece of ordinary matter which induces strangeness conserving kaon ",
    "nucleon strong interactions .",
    "the neutral kaon is then destroyed after being identified either as a @xmath2 or a @xmath7 in a typically projective measurement .",
    "the second basis consists of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states having well defined masses @xmath8 and decay widths @xmath9 ; it is the appropriate one to discuss neutral kaon propagation in free  space , with : @xmath10 , as well as lifetime measurements .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 eigenstates do not oscillate into each other in time , but , since @xmath11 , the short  lived component of a given neutral kaon extincts much faster than the long  lived one .",
    "because of this lifetime `` mark '' , knowing if this kaon has propagated in free  space _ either _ as @xmath0 _ or _ @xmath1 is thus possible by detecting at which time it decays . if kaons decaying before @xmath12 after production are identified as @xmath0 s and those surviving after this time as @xmath1 s , misidentifications amount to only a few parts in @xmath13 @xcite",
    ". the following relationship between the two kaon bases : latexmath:[\\ ] ] note that this third step restores the same @xmath0@xmath1 interference effects [ see eqs.([s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) ] of the first step , where single kaon states [ see eq .",
    "( [ statet ] ) ] are used .",
    "note also that the joint probabilities of eqs .",
    "( [ no - int ] ) and ( [ int ] ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are all of them even functions of @xmath91 .",
    "the erasure of the lifetime `` mark '' on the meter kaon can thus be delayed to times after the object kaon has been detected ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this `` delayed choice '' mode captures the essential feature of the quantum eraser @xcite , which is a proper sorting of the jointly detected events .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed new quantitative formulations of bohr s complementarity for free  space propagation of single and entangled pairs of neutral kaons .",
    "single neutral kaons allow for a generalization and clear application of the greenberger and yasin duality relation [ eq .",
    "( [ duality - gy ] ) ] . in this case , the two recent cplear experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite admit a transparent interpretation in terms of the quantitative complementarity requirement of eq .",
    "( [ duality - gy ] ) and the data fully agree with this equality . entangled @xmath93 pairs allows for the more interesting complementarity test in terms of `` width knowledge '' and `` width distinguishability '' suggested by englert and other authors .",
    "experimental tests on this issue could be performed at the @xmath39factory daphne @xcite .",
    "the neutral kaon system reveals also suitable for an optimal demonstration @xcite of quantum erasure : ( 1 ) the `` which width '' information is carried by a system ( the meter kaon ) distinct and spatially separated from the interfering system ( the object kaon ) ; ( 2 ) as a consequence , the erasure operation can be performed in the `` delayed choice '' mode ( @xmath94 ) ; ( 3 ) single  particle states ( as opposed to coherent states ) are detected on each side ; ( 4 ) in spite of the need to entangle the object kaon with another system ( the meter kaon ) , quantum erasure allows one to restore the same @xmath0@xmath1 interference phenomenon exhibited by a single kaon state produced as @xmath2 or @xmath7 .",
    "an experimental test of the marking and erasure operations we have discussed is desirable and should be feasible at @xmath39factories and @xmath95 machines .",
    "actually , the cplear collaboration @xcite has already done part of the work required : the two experimental points ( for @xmath96= 0 and @xmath97 ) collected by this experiment are compatible with the joint strangeness oscillations predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ int ] ) .",
    "new measurements confirming with better precision these oscillations for a larger range of @xmath91 values , as well as the non  oscillating behaviour when `` which width '' information is in principle available [ see eq .",
    "( [ no - int ] ) ] , are needed for a full demonstration of quantitative duality and the quantum eraser with neutral kaons .",
