    "sudden catastrophic failure of structures due to unexpected fracture of component materials is a concern and a challenging problem of physics as well as engineering .",
    "the dynamics of the failure of materials show interesting properties and hence there has been an enormous amount of study on the breakdown phenomena till now@xcite .",
    "the complexity involved in fracture processes can be suitably modelled by grossly simplified models .",
    "the simplest available model is fiber bundle model(fbm ) @xcite .",
    "a fbm consists of n parallel fibers .",
    "the disorder of a real system is introduced in the fiber bundle in the form of random distribution of strength of each fiber taken from a probability density p(@xmath0 ) and hence called random fiber bundle model ( rfbm ) .",
    "the strength of each fiber is called its threshold strength . as a force f",
    "is applied externally on a bundle of n fibers , a stress @xmath1 develops on each of them .",
    "the fibers which have their threshold strength smaller than the stress generated , will break immediately .",
    "the next question that arises is the affect of breaking of these fibers on the remaining intact fibers @xmath2 , one has to decide a load sharing rule .",
    "the two extreme cases of load sharing mechanisms are global load sharing ( gls)@xcite and local load sharing ( lls)@xcite . in gls , the stress of the broken fiber is equally distributed to the remaining intact fibers .",
    "this rule neglects local fluctuations in stress and therefore is effectively a mean field model with long range interactions among the elements of the system @xcite . on the other hand , in lls",
    "the stress of the broken fiber is given only to its nearest surviving neighbours .",
    "it is obvious that the actual breaking process involves a sharing rule which is in between gls and lls .",
    "several studies have been made which considers a rule interpolating between gls and lls @xcite .    for a given force f ,",
    "some fibers break and they distribute their load to the surviving fibers following a load sharing rule causing further failure and redistribution of stress .",
    "this process continues until all the remaining fibers have their threshold strength greater than the redistributed stress acting on them .",
    "this corresponds to the fixed point of the dynamics of the system . as the applied force",
    "is increased on the system , more and more fibers break .",
    "an avalanche of size s is defined as the number of failed fibers between two successive external loadings .",
    "there exist a critical load ( or stress @xmath3 ) beyond which if the load is applied , complete failure of the system takes place . most of the studies on fbm involve the determination of the critical stress @xmath3 and the investigation of the type of phase transition from a state of partial failure to a state of complete failure",
    ". it has been shown that a bundle following gls has a finite value of critical stress and belongs to a universality class with a specific set of critical exponents@xcite whereas there is no finite critical stress @xmath3 at thermodynamic limit in the case of lls in one dimension@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , lls on complex network has been shown to belong to the same universality class as that of gls with the same critical exponents@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a fbm with mixed fibers .",
    "fibers have their threshold strength randomly chosen from weibull distributions with two different index parameters .",
    "the motivation here is to study the dynamics of random fibers in the presence of disorder caused due to mixing of two types of fibers with overlapping distribution of threshold strengths .",
    "moreover , the probabilistic method implemented to estimate the critical stress can be very easily used to study any type of mixed fiber bundles thus enabling one to put maximum disorder in the system being studied .    section ii consists of description of the model highlighting the method used . in section",
    "iii we present the results .",
    "section iv includes discussions and conclusions .",
    "in the weibull distribution ( wd ) of threshold strength of fibers , the probability of failure of each element when a stress @xmath0 is generated has a form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a reference strength and @xmath6 is called the weibull index .",
    "we consider a mixed rfbm with wd of threshold strength of fibers where strengths of fibers are randomly chosen from two different distributions characterised by different weibull indices and study the critical behaviour of the model . a fraction @xmath7 ( henceforth called the mixing parameter ) of fibers belong to the class a ( wd with @xmath8 ) and the remaining @xmath9 fraction belong to the class b ( wd with @xmath10 ) with the reference strength @xmath5 set equal to one in both the distributions .",
    "the probabilistic method introduced by moreno , gomez and pacheco @xcite is extended to explore the critical behaviour of the above model .",
    "for the conventional wd @xmath11 , let us consider a situation where the stress on each fiber increases from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the probability that a fiber randomly chosen from the wd survives from the load @xmath12 but fails when the load is @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 thus the probability that the chosen fiber that has survived the load @xmath12 also survives the ( higher ) load @xmath13 is @xmath15 .",
    "the key point is that the force f on the bundle is increased quasistatically so that only the weakest fiber amongst the remaining intact fibers break .",
    "thus , one needs to identify the weakest fiber , break that fiber and then calculate the number of remaining unbroken fibers using @xmath16 recursively , updating the value of @xmath17 and @xmath18 due to the load given away by the broken fibers , until no more failure occurs . as mentioned previously , the dynamics of breaking will continue till the system reaches a fixed point .",
    "the process of slow increase of external load is carried on up to the critical stress @xmath3 .",
    "the method avoids the random averaging involved in a monte carlo simulation and hence turns out to be very useful in dealing with fluctuations .",
    "however , to deal with the @xmath19 random fiber bundle model , the above method needs to be generalised in an appropriate manner .",
    "the essential point is the fact that we need to keep track of number of unbroken fibers in each distribution separately .",
    "let us assume that after a loading is done and a fixed point is reached , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number of unbroken fibers corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath22 distribution respectively , and @xmath23 is the stress per fiber at that instant .     for a rfbm with two distributions corresponding to @xmath24 , @xmath25 and n=50000.,width=201,height=192 ]    we define @xmath26 and @xmath27 as follows : @xmath28 one needs to calculate the load @xmath29 that has to be applied to break one fiber . here",
    ", @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) is the next weakest fiber in the @xmath8 ( or @xmath22 ) distribution of strength of fibers and is obtained by the solution of the following equations : @xmath33 which gives @xmath34^{1/\\rho_1}\\\\",

    "let us assume that during this avalanche , at some point before the fixed point is reached , there are @xmath35 and @xmath36 number of unbroken fibers belonging to the two distributions where each fiber is under a stress @xmath37 .",
    "this stress causes some more failures and as a result @xmath38 and @xmath39 fibers are unbroken",
    ". let the new stress developed be @xmath40 .",
    "the number of fibers which survive @xmath37 and @xmath40 are obtained using the relation @xmath41 the stress on each fiber is now equal to @xmath42 .",
    "eq ( 4 ) and eq .",
    "( 5 ) are used again and again until a fixed point is reached .",
    "the fixed point condition is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a small number ( 0.001 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the critical behaviour does not depend on the choice of @xmath44 .",
    "after the fixed point is reached , stress @xmath45 is calculated once again as mentioned before and the whole process is repeated till complete failure occurs at @xmath3 .    it should also be mentioned here that the critical stress @xmath46 can also be derived using directly the cumulative distribution function for the mixed model as given in eq .",
    "( 6 ) in @xmath47 .",
    "however in this case , the expression of @xmath48 , as defined above , turns out to be very complicated and it is difficult to arrive at a simple closed form as shown in eq .",
    "( 2 ) or ( 3 ) .",
    "we present here the main results of a particular case , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . fig .  1 shows the fraction of total number of broken fibers as a function of applied stress @xmath0 .",
    "the graph clearly shows the existence of a critical stress @xmath51 at which fraction of failed fibers increases rapidly and the bundle breaks down completely .",
    "the critical stress of the mixed bundle lies between that of the two pure bundles ( for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 obtained using @xmath54)@xcite .",
    "thus , the resulting critical stress of the mixed fiber bundle model can be tuned by varying the mixing parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the mean avalanche size s of failure is defined as the total number of broken fibers between two successive loadings .",
    "it diverges near the critical point as @xmath55 with an exponent @xmath56 .",
    "scaling behaviour of s is shown in fig .  2 .",

    "the probabilistic approach @xcite implemented to determine @xmath46 turns out to be inappropriate in exploring the behaviour of avalanche size distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mean avalanche sizes ( @xmath57 ) obtained for different @xmath0 are of fractional values which leads to a difficulty in calculating the distribution of avalanche sizes .",
    "we therefore use the standard monte - carlo method along with the weakest fiber approach @xcite where the external load is increased by an amount sufficient to break the weakest intact fiber .",
    "the corresponding integer value of the size of an avalanche is denoted by @xmath58 . for gls ,",
    "the distribution @xmath59 of an avalanche of size @xmath58 follows a power law @xmath60 , where @xmath61 in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "3 shows the avalanche size distribution for the present mixed rfbm obtained numerically with @xmath25 ; a power law behaviour with the same exponent 5/2 is clearly observed , confirming the mean field nature of the model . that the 5/2 behaviour is expected even for a mixed rfbm for any @xmath7",
    "can be justified using the saddle point method applicable in the limit of large @xmath58@xcite . in the present case ( @xmath62 and @xmath50 ) , the probability that a fiber will break when subjected to a stress @xmath0 is @xmath63+(1-x)[1-{\\rm exp}(-\\sigma^3)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the density distribution becomes @xmath64 the avalanche size distribution takes the form @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\",

    "the function inside the square bracket has a maximum when @xmath70 it should be noted that the above condition is satisfied when @xmath71 . since the threshold distribution of fibers , ( eq .  ( 7 ) ) , does not have any discontinuity , the saddle point integration of eq .",

    "a clear crossover from @xmath76 to @xmath77 is observed with @xmath78 .",
    "the slope of the thick line is -3/2 and dotted line is -5/2 .",
    "the inset shows the avalanche size distribution for the critical case along with a line of slope of -3/2.,width=201,height=201 ]    let us now comment on the imminent failure @xcite behaviour , when a fraction of weak fibers are already removed , and the distribution is close to the critical distribution @xmath79 , the strength of the weakest intact fiber @xmath80 is close to the redistributed stress @xmath81 at the critical point .",
    "we shall consider the case when @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the variation of @xmath59 with @xmath58 is shown in fig .  4 and as in the pure weibull case",
    ", we observe a crossover from @xmath76 to @xmath77 as @xmath58 increases .",
    "for the critical distribution , however , we observe a @xmath76 behaviour for the whole range of @xmath58 ( inset fig .  4 ) .",
    "although the power law behaviour of the avalanche size distribution near the critical distribution remain unaltered by mixing , one may ask the question about the behaviour of @xmath82 with @xmath7 ( where @xmath82 denotes the avalanche size at which crossover from 3/2 to 5/2 is observed ) . for the case of interest ,",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath50 , @xmath82 does not change appreciably with @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath66 is almost constant as @xmath7 is varied ( explained later ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the case @xmath83 and @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , @xmath82 should decrease with @xmath7 keeping @xmath84 constant because as x is increased @xmath66 also increases taking the system away from critical distribution .    the critical exponent @xmath85 and the power - law behaviour of avalanche size distribution of the mixed model",
    "remain unchanged for any value of mixing parameter @xmath7 .",

    "5 ) . to justify the linear behaviour , we recall the probability distribution ( eq .",
    "a relation between the critical stress and @xmath66 can be obtained by calculating the applied force at @xmath66 where @xmath66 is a solution of eq .",
    "@xmath86    for the conventional wd , @xmath87 , which immediately reveals the fact that the difference in @xmath66 for the cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 is very small as compared to the change in corresponding @xmath46 values . to a good approximation , one can set @xmath90 , so that eq.(10 ) combined with eq .",
    "( 7 ) yields @xmath91 + ( 1-x ) 3c^2 { \\rm exp } ( -c^3)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & x c^2 [ 2c{\\rm exp}(-c^2)-3c^2{\\rm exp}(-c^3 ) ] + 3c^4{\\rm exp}(-c^3)\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which justifies the dominant linear dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath7 for this particular case .",
    "it should also be emphasised that this linear relationship is a characteristic of situations where the variation of @xmath66 is negligible ( to the lowest order ) as @xmath7 is tuned from zero to one ( @xmath92 the present case ) and in general there is a non - linear relationship as shown in fig .",
    "6 .    in a recent work @xcite",
    ", the shear failure of a glued interface has been studied using a simple beam model where beams ( fibers ) connect the two surfaces .",
    "the stretching and bending threshold strength of the beams , denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively , are randomly distributed variables satisfying a joint probability distribution function @xmath95 .",
    "the mean field critical exponents are obtained when the threshold distributions for bending and stretching modes are independent and chosen from two different wd . in our model , we study fibers with threshold strength chosen from two weibull distribution with different weibull indices and the critical exponents stick to the mean field values also in our case .",
    "the critical stress of a mixed rfbm with weibull distribution and gls is studied using a probabilistic approach where the external force is increased quasistatically at every step of loading@xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not require the process of random averaging which takes comparatively longer computational time .",
    "we obtain the variation of critical stress with parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this functional dependence of the critical stress on the characteristic quantity @xmath96 is an important objective of this work .",
    "the critical behaviour of the mixed model namely the critical exponents and the power law behaviour of the burst avalanche distribution are same as mean field . in a mixed weibull distribution ,",
    "the threshold distribution of the two types of fibers are overlapping or the distribution is continuous .",
    "the presence of discontinuity modifies the avalanche size distribution for smaller @xmath58@xcite .",
    "hence one expects the mean field ( gls ) behaviour of the mixed model .",
    "the behaviour of the imminent failure shows a crossover in the avalanche size exponent from 5/2 to 3/2 as the critical distribution is approached . in some distributions",
