    "since string theory is supposed to describe physics at scales which are not reachable in any terrestrial laboratory cosmological models predicted by string theory might be the suitable candidates for facing this theory with nature .",
    "therefore there has been quite some interest in studying cosmological vacua of string theory [ [ first]-[last ] ] .",
    "a major approach in studying string cosmology is based on the pre - big - bang scenario [ [ ven1]-[venlast ] ] , ( for a recent review containing additional references on the topic see @xcite ) . in the pre - big - bang scenario",
    "two cosmological solutions related by scale factor duality are connected in a strong coupling region .",
    "since one of the solution describes an accelerated expanding universe ( inflationary branch ) whereas the second solution corresponds to a decelerated expanding universe ( frw branch ) this scenario has many realistic phenomenological implications .",
    "however , it suffers from some open questions .",
    "because the strong coupling region is hardly accessible one outstanding problem is the description of the details how the two solutions are smoothly connected ( graceful exit problem ) @xcite .",
    "the second track one can follow is to find more general cosmological string vacua , e.g.   with non vanishing spatial curvature . here",
    ", one can employ the considerable progress in the understanding of low - energy solutions of string theory which has been made during the last years .",
    "hopefully , this approach will finally converge with the one described above .",
    "a better understanding of low - energy solutions of string theory was achieved by interpreting those solutions as intersections of the @xmath3-brane solutions of type ii string theory .",
    "first one reinterpreted the known 4-d black holes as bound states of brane solution .",
    "but the procedure is quite general and can also be used to find new solutions in 4 dimensions , not only of 0-brane type ( black holes ) but also of 1-brane ( string ) or ( -1)-brane type ( instanton ) . for a classification of all multiple intersections of @xmath3-branes",
    "see @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are going to discuss 4-d cosmological solutions obtained by compactification of 6-d heterotic string solutions .",
    "the standard cosmology is described in terms of a robertson - walker metric @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the world radius and @xmath6 , which is the 3-d spherical volume measure with the curvature @xmath7 .",
    "this metric ansatz takes into account that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ( as a good approximation ) .",
    "translated into the brane picture this means , that the robertson - walker space - time describes a ( -1)-brane , i.e.  the big bang is a point in the 4-d space - time .    following this philosophy ,",
    "there are two ways to obtain cosmological solutions from intersecting branes .",
    "the first one is to consider already a ( -1)-brane in 10 dimensions and as second way one can consider the `` standard '' brane intersection and wraps the complete world volumes of the branes into the internal space . in order to be able to wrap",
    "the world volume of the brane one has to rotate the world volume such that the time coordinate is orthogonal to it .",
    "this can be done by performing a special analytic continuation ( wick - rotation ) or by taking a non - extreme brane solution and going behind the outer horizon where the time and radius coordinates interchange .    in heterotic string theory , one has the fundamental string and @xmath8 - 5-brane solution in 10-d .",
    "wrapping the 5-brane world volume into the internal space one gets immediately a cosmological solution in 4-d .",
    "making this solution non - extremal and going behind the horizon one obtains a cosmological model that includes all possible values for the spatial curvature @xmath9 @xcite . since the @xmath8 - 5-brane is part of all superstring theories one can explore the type iib @xmath10-duality in order to convert the brane into a @xmath11 - 5-brane @xcite .",
    "this way one can get some insight into strong coupling corrections to cosmological string vacua since @xmath11 charged states are non perturbative states .",
    "a more systematic approach to cosmological solutions coming from any type of branes has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the field equations of any ( non - extreme ) brane solution , which shall be wrapped completely into the internal space can be reduced to 1-d field equations . in special cases",
    "one can solve these equations or use known solutions , e.g.  in terms of toda models @xcite . in this procedure",
    "one has , however , to take into account that the intersections of extreme branes always yield a trivial einstein frame metric @xcite .",
    "since in these models the big bang appears as the surface of the @xmath3-branes one can argue , that these branes could yield to a resolution of the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we will find that the inclusion of world sheet loop corrections ( @xmath12 ) in addition to string loop corrections ( @xmath13 ) might lead to a completely non singular universe .",
    "a solution containing the two kinds of corrections is the gauge dyonic string constructed in @xcite .",
    "this solution contains an @xmath14 instanton and thus chern - simons and green - schwarz corrections are non - trivial .",
    "our aim in this paper is to investigate those `` instanton effects '' in a four dimensional cosmological context .",
    "therefore , our starting point is a heterotic 6-d model , which corresponds in 10-d to a fundamental string lying inside an @xmath8 - 5-brane ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we will compactify this heterotic solution on a @xmath0 manifold yielding an @xmath15 string cosmology in 4 dimensions after further compactification on @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the @xmath0 compactified heterotic string and describe the toroidal compactification down to four dimensions . in section 3",
    "we study various six dimensional vacua describing ( macroscopic ) strings . by an analytic continuation",
    "we rotate the world volume of those strings into space - like directions and obtain the ( -1)-brane configurations required for a cosmological interpretation .",
    "section 4 deals with the resulting four dimensional cosmologies .",
    "we will first review known results for the instanton - free case and afterwards we will discuss the special effect of the ym instantons .",
    "we will also comment on the corresponding brane picture .",

    "@xmath127 this rederivation is useful since it teaches us some interesting facts about the analytic continuation . at the first sight it seems to be quite disappointing that we obtained the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) since that implies that we will not be able to get cosmological solutions with a flat or a spherical three - space",
    "on the other hand this condition is logical for the following reasons .",
    "when we send @xmath128 to zero the spatial @xmath129 decompactifies to a flat space and hence the instanton solution loses its topological meaning of mapping the spatial @xmath129 onto the @xmath14-@xmath129 .",

    "@xmath147 the locus of the `` world sheet instanton '' in the four dimensional space - time will move along geodesics with respect to @xmath153 that is , when we probe the four dimensional space - time with those `` world sheet instantons '' we will not encounter problems due to imaginary electric and magnetic charges , ( for magnetic charges one has to repeat the consideration for a heterotic dual string - probe leading to the same result with @xmath154 replaced by @xmath155 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that it might be interesting to include the non - abelian background into the probe - action . for that one",

    "we have rotated the world volume of the 5-brane in a way that the time is the transversal to the brane , matter can flow only in one direction . from the thermodynamical point of view",
    "this means , the configuration is not in an equilibrium as one would expect for a non - extremal solution .",

    "the fundamental string , that lies on the 5-brane seems to play no role .",
    "really , turning on and off the electric charge has no influence on the 4-d geometry and neither on the 4-d dilaton .",
