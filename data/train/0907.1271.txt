    "understanding the pattern of fermion masses and flavour mixing is still one of the open fundamental questions in particle physics .",
    "the discovery of large leptonic mixing , in contrast to small quark mixing , has rendered the flavour puzzle even more intriguing .    in the standard model ( sm ) and in",
    "most of its extensions , the arbitrariness of fermion masses and mixing stems from the fact that the gauge invariance does not constrain the flavour structure of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the fact that , in the sm , only yukawa couplings can be complex , has motivated the hypothesis of universality of strength of yukawa couplings ( usy ) usy - first , which would all have the same strength , with flavour - dependent phases .",
    "the consequences of usy have been analyzed in various works , both for the quark @xcite and lepton sectors @xcite .",
    "such an usy structure for the yukawa couplings could arise from higher - dimensional theories @xcite .    in this paper , we suggest a highly predictive usy ansatz which is able to accommodate our present experimental knowledge on lepton masses and mixing and makes definite predictions , which can be tested in the near future . more specifically , in this usy ansatz , once the charged lepton and neutrino masses are fixed , the three leptonic mixing angles , the dirac phases and the two majorana phases are all predicted in terms of only one free parameter .",
    "this highly constrained system implies interesting correlations among various physical quantities .",

    "for central values of @xmath16 , @xmath12 and @xmath17 , one obtains @xmath18 , which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
