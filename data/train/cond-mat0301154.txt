    "we define a model of inhomogeneous scattering , which is as simple as possible and represents a medium that is uniform and isotropic on a large scale .",
    "we call it the _ isotropic inhomogeneous scattering model _",
    "( iism).@xcite the model is motivated by experiments on superfluid @xmath0he in a porous aerogel , and all our numerical computations concentrate on this case .",
    "however , the model is independent of the pairing symmetry and therefore can equally be applied , for example , to @xmath2- or @xmath3-wave superconductors .",
    "liquid @xmath0he is an ideal example of unconventional superfluid because it is naturally pure , it has a spherical fermi surface , and its @xmath4-wave pairing state is well understood .",
    "therefore it is of interest to study impurity effects in this superfluid .",
    "the addition of impurities to helium can be done by using porous aerogel so that typically 98% of the volume is occupied by @xmath0he .",
    "it was found experimentally that the superfluid transition temperature in aerogel is reduced but remains sharp.@xcite also other superfluid properties such as the superfluid density and the nmr shifts were found to be modified by aerogel .",
    "many experiments studying this system have been made during the last seven years.@xcite    the hsm is an attractive model for @xmath0he in aerogel because of its simplicity .",
    "essentially all theoretical calculations for this system are based on it .",
    "@xcite however , already the first comparisons to experiment showed that the hsm is insufficient quantitatively . in particular , it was found that the order parameter is more suppressed than the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "a natural explanation for this comes from the fact that the scattering in aerogel is not homogeneous , as has already been demonstrated using the iism.@xcite similar results have been reached in calculations on unconventional superconductors .",
    "@xcite    preliminary results of the iism have been reported in refs . and .",

    "our studies are based on the quasiclassical theory of fermi liquids .",

    "the equations of quasiclassical theory and the details of calculations are discussed in the appendix .",
    "on a microscopic scale a pure system is described in terms of particles ( conduction electrons or @xmath0he atoms ) and their interaction .",
    "because the interactions are strong , this leads to a complicated many - body problem .",
    "the characteristic length in superconductivity or superfluidity is the coherence length .",
    "we define this quantity as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity .",
    "to be precise , we have used the superfluid transition temperature @xmath7 of a pure system .",
    "the coherence length is typically much larger than the fermi wave length @xmath8 . in @xmath0he @xmath9",
    "depends on pressure and changes from 16 nm at the solidification pressure to 77 nm at the vapor pressure whereas @xmath10 nm .    the theory that is designed to work on the scale @xmath11 is the quasiclassical theory.@xcite it treats the system as a dilute gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "in quasiclassical theory all the many - body physics that takes place on the microscopic scale @xmath12 is eliminated .",
    "it only appears through phenomenological parameters like the fermi - surface , landau fermi - liquid parameters and transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider any external objects in the system .",
    "these objects are characterized by a strong potential , on the order of the fermi energy . as a consequence",
    "the state of the system is modified in the vicinity of the object .",
    "a theoretical analysis of these atomic scale changes is again difficult because of the strong interactions between particles .    in the quasiclassical theory",
    "the effect of external objects is twofold.@xcite first , the phenomenological parameters discussed above are changed .",
    "these parameters are determined by processes on the fermi - energy scale and are therefore of short range .",
    "assuming that the surface area of the external objects times the atomic length scale ( @xmath12 ) is a small fraction of the total volume , this effect is small and is neglected in the following .",
    "second , the objects affect the low energy processes ( energy @xmath13 ) directly via a scattering of quasiparticles .",
    "the range of this effect is long , on the order of the coherence length [ eq .",
    "( [ e.cohlength ] ) ] .",
    "therefore it leads to substantial modification of the superfluid properties .",
    "an important length characterizing the scattering is the mean free path @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest case is to consider the limit @xmath15 .",
    "this is the quasiclassical limit where the fermi wave length effectively disappears from the theory .",
    "first order corrections in @xmath16 lead to effects like weak localization , which are neglected here .",
    "in quasiclassical theory , the scattering is represented by a collection of `` scattering centers . ''",
    "the main assumption is that the quantum interference between two scattering centers is neglected .",
    "technically this can be achieved considering an ensemble average where the locations @xmath17 of the scattering centers are uncertain by a distance on the order of @xmath18 or more .",
    "the size of one scattering center is limited by the condition that it has to be localized on the scale of @xmath9 .",
    "the scattering properties of a center can be parametrized by scattering phase shifts @xmath19 , which are taken at the fermi energy in the normal state .",
    "( for simplicity we label the different partial waves by a single index @xmath20 , but there is no need to restrict to spherically symmetric scattering centers .",
    "the scattering could also be spin - dependent , but it is also neglected here for simplicity . )",
    "thus a complete description of the scattering needed in the quasiclassical theory consists of distribution functions @xmath21 and scattering phase shifts @xmath22 of the scattering centers @xmath23 .    within each scattering center",
    "an exact quantum treatment is allowed in principle . however , because of uncertainty about the microscopic processes at surfaces , the phase shifts @xmath22 can not be calculated from first principles . instead ,",
    "one has to use some models , for example hard spheres.@xcite in some quantities the phase shifts only appear in certain combinations , for example , the transport cross section @xmath24    let us try to clarify some consequences of the assumptions made above .",
    "the energy one usually is trying to calculate is on the order of @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the superfluid condensation energy per volume , and a typical volume @xmath27 . above the individual scattering centers",
    "were required to be small , @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the energy @xmath29 associated with a single impurity@xcite is small in comparison .",
    "the typical number of impurities in volume @xmath30 is @xmath31 , which for random impurities implies a fluctuation @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding fluctuation in energy is by factor @xmath33 smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "this has to be neglected since there are other neglected contributions that are on the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus impurity averaging in the quasiclassical approximation implies a scattering medium where the fluctuations in the impurity density are neglected .",
    "the structure of aerogel , as relevant for @xmath0he experiments , is discussed in ref .  .",
    "here we repeat some main points .",
    "aerogel consists of small sio@xmath35 particles of diameter @xmath36 nm , which are coalesced together to form a self - supporting structure .",
    "experiments with @xmath0he typically use aerogels with open volume fraction 98% or more . according to small - angle x - ray scattering measurements",
    ", there is a `` fractal '' range in the particle cluster up to a `` correlation length '' @xmath37 nm . above this scale",
    "the structure looks homogeneous .",
    "computer simulations give a picture of widely spaced aerogel strands implying a long mean free path @xmath38 nm .    it seems reasonable that the quasiclassical description above can be applied to liquid @xmath0he in aerogel .",
    "the atomic layer on the sio@xmath35 surfaces occupies only one per cent of the volume and can be neglected for many purposes .",
    "( magnetic properties make an exception because the susceptibility in this layer is much larger than in pure liquid.@xcite ) since a major part of the liquid is within a coherence length from sio@xmath35,@xcite the scattering effect leads to a substantial modification of the superfluid properties .",
    "it also seems that the scattering from aerogel can be represented by incoherent scattering centers whose size is small compared to @xmath9 because random variations on the order of @xmath12 are likely to develop already at much smaller distances .",
    "the smallest reasonable choice for a scattering center is a single sio@xmath35 particle ( diameter @xmath39 nm ) .",
    "this is large in comparison to @xmath12 : @xmath40 .",
    "according to hard sphere phase shifts this means that only @xmath41 of the scattering takes place in the s - wave channel , and @xmath42 is left to higher partial waves in eq .",
    "( [ e.sigmatr ] ) . this dominant contribution of higher partial waves has several important consequences .",
    "firstly , the phase shifts @xmath22 _ are random numbers_. this is because even the phase shifts ( modulo @xmath43 ) of a hard sphere with a fixed @xmath44 are pseudorandom numbers for @xmath45 .",
    "adding to this the varying particle size , the surface roughness and varying orientations of touching neighbor particles , it is simply impossible that the result would be anything else but random .",
    "( the randomness , of course , is valid only for partial waves @xmath20 that contribute essentially to scattering , i.e. , for @xmath46 . )",
    "a consequence of the random phase shifts is that only the number of scattering phase shifts , or equivalently , the cross section @xmath47 [ eq .",
    "( [ e.sigmatr ] ) ] is important in describing a scattering center .",
    "thus a sufficient description of the scattering is obtained by specifying only @xmath48 and @xmath21 .",
    "a second important consequence of the large particle size is that both @xmath48 and @xmath21 are independent of pressure .",
    "this is crucial for comparison with experiments , because when fitting is needed , it can be done at one pressure only , and the predictions of the model get fixed at all pressures .",
    "we argue as follows .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the aerogel is independent of the hydrostatic pressure , implying that @xmath21 is also .",
    "the fermi wave vector changes by 10% over the pressure range from the vapor pressure to the solidification pressure .",
    "this could induce some pressure dependence in the cross section @xmath48 .",
    "for example , hard - sphere @xmath47 depends essentially on @xmath49 in the region @xmath50.@xcite however , in the physical region @xmath51 the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath49 is very weak .",
    "thus we conclude that both @xmath48 and @xmath21 are independent of pressure .",
    "the large @xmath52 is potentially bad news for theory because calculations that take higher partial waves into account are very complicated , see ref .  .",
    "the promising conclusion of these calculations is that , at least in some cases , the results including higher partial waves are almost identical to those including only s - wave _ under the following conditions _ :",
    "( i ) one uses the same transport mean free path @xmath14 and ( ii ) one uses either random phase shift @xmath53 or fixed @xmath54 in the s - wave calculation . here",
    "we assume that this correspondence holds more generally .",
    "thus we calculate only s - wave and present results for @xmath55 .",
    "finally , the randomness of the phase shifts also simplifies the numerical calculations since it implies that some components of the propagator vanish ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the use of several impurity species is important in studying anisotropic scattering where the preferred direction varies in space . in this paper",
    "we limit to isotropic scattering . in order to simplify the notation we select all scattering centers to have equal cross section , so that the only scattering parameters are @xmath47 and the total impurity density @xmath56 .",
    "the simplest possible impurity profile @xmath56 is a constant .",
    "it implies a location independent ( transport ) mean free path @xmath57 . this _ homogenous scattering model _ ( hsm )",
    "has successfully been used to model the impurities in superconductors.@xcite for impure @xmath4-wave superfluid ( @xmath0he ) it has been used to calculate the critical temperature,@xcite the order parameter and superfluid density@xcite , properties near the superfluid transition,@xcite properties in magnetic field,@xcite density of states,@xcite thermal conductivity@xcite and estimate strong - coupling effects.@xcite    the predictions of the hsm are compared to experiments in refs . and",
    ", see also below . compared to pure @xmath0he , the hsm gives the right tendency and can work even quantitatively in some cases , but there can be differences up to a factor of 5 in the suppression factors ( see below ) . in some papers the experiments",
    "are compared with data that is calculated in the unitary limit of s - wave scattering , which seems to give better agreement than other phase shifts . as explained above",
    ", we believe this is misguided , and random or intermediate phase shifts should be used instead .",
    "the observed differences can more naturally be explained by inhomogeneous scattering as will be shown below , at least for some quantities .",
    "real aerogel has voids where scattering is negligible",
    ". this can be modelled by an impurity density @xmath56 which depends on the location @xmath58 .",
    "it is in principle possible to use a realistic @xmath56 for aerogel .",
    "this has the drawback that the computational volume should be large in order to get a representative sample , and this implies heavy numerical effort .",
    "here we prefer the opposite limit of a simple model @xmath56 .",
    "the simplest possibility would be a plane - wave variation @xmath59 .",
    "a stronger version of this would be equally spaced scattering planes . in the limit of very strong scattering in the planes",
    "this leads to isolated slabs.@xcite the problem with all these models is that they are anisotropic .",
    "for example , the superfluid density would depend on the direction of the superfluid velocity @xmath60 . in comparison to experiments",
    "one should use some average over the directions , but this neglects the process how the averaging really takes place by a nonuniform current distribution .",
    "the purpose of the _ isotropic inhomogeneous scattering model _ ( iism ) ( ref . ) is to incorporate a non - constant @xmath56 with spherical symmetry .",
    "we take a spherical volume of radius @xmath61 and use an impurity density @xmath62 that depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that these spheres fill all the space .",
