    "currently , nearly all of our knowledge of the intracluster medium ( icm ) comes from x - ray observations , with the latest generation of x - ray satellites , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , being capable of spatially resolving the density and temperature structure independently in low - redshift clusters out to tens of per cent of their virial radii ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "separate density and temperature information is vital for probing the effects of physical processes ( such as galactic outflows ) on the structure of the icm ( e.g. from the entropy and pressure profiles ) , as well as for constructing mass  observable relationships for use in cosmological analyses .",
    "the latter is currently being driven by x - ray surveys such as the _ xmm _ cluster survey @xcite , promising to find many new clusters out to redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the icm is also detectable at centimetre and millimetre wavelengths through the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off free electrons in the icm . as the sz effect is a scattering process",
    ", the observed sz signal is independent of cluster redshift .",
    "thus , thousands of new high - redshift clusters are promised from upcoming sz surveys such as that to be performed by the south pole telescope @xcite .    for most clusters ,",
    "the sz effect will only measure the integrated pressure of the electrons along the line of sight , and so its use as a probe of icm structure will be limited without additional x - ray data .",
    "the combination of sz and x - ray surface brightness profiles yields a promising new way of obtaining cluster temperature information without having to resort to expensive x - ray spectroscopy ; such a method yields a temperature that is closer to the mass - weighted temperature of the cluster @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , to measure the temperature of the icm directly in the hottest clusters with multi - frequency sz observations alone , due to significant relativistic effects in these systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the above , this estimate of the temperature ( hereafter refered to as the _ sz _ temperature ) is weighted by the pressure of the electrons along the line of sight . how the sz and x - ray temperature measurements differ systematically , from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "is the subject of this short paper . here , using @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters , we quantify the difference and show that it can be as large as a factor of two , primarily due to the _ clumpiness _ in the icm , associated with incomplete thermal support .",
    "we also show that the temperature directly derived from sz data is the more faithful tracer of the underlying cluster potential , being within 10 per cent of the virial temperature in all clusters studied .",
    "the temperature of the icm ( or any portion of it ) is most easily measured by fitting a single - temperature plasma model to the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "as the emission is primarily due to thermal bremsstrahlung ( free  free ) in hot clusters ( @xmath2 kev or so ) , the temperature is determined by the energy scale , @xmath3 , above which the emission decays exponentially . since",
    "a single - temperature model is used to fit a multi - temperature distribution , the result is known as a spectroscopically - weighted average of the plasma temperature .",
    "recently , @xcite calibrated this weighting using @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters and proposed a simple estimator , known as the _ spectroscopic - like _ temperature @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass density of a fluid element in volume , @xmath6 , with temperature , @xmath7 . since the weighting factor is @xmath8 , cooler dense ( i.e. lower entropy ) gas is weighted the most",
    ". naturally , cooling gas increases its density to try and re - establish hydrostatic equilibrium , so regions where cooling is important ( particularly the core ) have a strong influence on the x - ray temperature of the icm .",
    "an alternative , but much harder , measurement of the icm temperature comes from the spectral distortion induced by a cluster on the cmb , the sz effect .",
    "the fractional change in cmb temperature is @xmath9 \\ , d\\tau , \\label{eqn : szdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath10k @xcite , @xmath11 is the electron temperature of the icm , @xmath12 its density , @xmath13 the line - of - sight velocity , and @xmath14 the change in optical depth to compton scattering along the differential line element , @xmath15 .",
    "the three frequency - dependent pre - factors , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , allow the separation of the sz signal to be performed ( with @xmath18 for all @xmath19 ) .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eqn : szdef ] ) dominates for reasonable assumptions of cluster properties , and is due to the thermal energy of the ( mainly ) non - relativistic electron population .",
    "the second term is the temperature - dependent correction due to relativistic electrons which can be significant for hot clusters ; it is this term that we will make use of to estimate the icm temperature .",
    "finally , the third term ( known as the kinetic sz effect ) is due to the bulk motion of the plasma .    the frequency - independent part of the first term is usually expressed as the compton @xmath20 parameter @xmath21 following hansen ( 2004 ) , we can then define the compton - average of any quantity @xmath22 as @xmath23 so the compton - averaged electron temperature is @xmath24 the relativistic correction , @xmath25 , can be approximated as @xmath26 ; higher - order corrections due to ultrarelativistic electrons are subdominant in all but the very hottest clusters @xcite . in the rayleigh ",
    "jeans limit ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite . also ignoring the kinetic sz effect",
    ", we can thus approximate equation  ( [ eqn : szdef ] ) as @xmath30.\\ ] ]    .weights used to define the hot ( @xmath31k ) gas mass - weighted temperature , @xmath32 , the x - ray spectroscopic - like temperature , @xmath33 , and the sz temperature , @xmath34 . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : temp ]    we first present various measurements of the mean temperature within the ( projected ) virial radius of each simulated cluster .",
    "besides the x - ray and sz temperatures , we also consider the projected hot gas mass - weighted temperature , @xmath32 , and the 3d virial temperature , @xmath35 ( see @xcite ) , the most suitable temperature for cosmological applications of clusters .",
    "the measured temperatures are given in table  [ tab : temp ] .",
    "the hot gas mass - weighted temperature , @xmath36 , and x - ray spectroscopic - like temperature , @xmath33 , are both lower than the virial temperature , with the exception of one of the _ feedback _ clusters ( fb1 ) , where @xmath37 . in general ,",
    "the difference between these two temperatures and the virial temperature is larger for the _ non - radiative _ clusters than the _ feedback _ clusters , the most extreme case being nr3 , where @xmath38 . part of this difference can be attributed to projection effects , i.e. including gas extending to 3 virial radii from the cluster centre , along the line of sight , when calculating @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "cooler gas , associated with infalling substructure , is more prevalent on the outskirts of clusters , causing a significant downward shift in the measured temperatures .",
    "when the calculation of projected temperatures is restricted to gas within @xmath39 in all directions , the difference between these temperatures and @xmath35 is approximately halved .",
    ", for the _ non - radiative _ ( dashed lines ) and _ feedback _ ( solid lines ) clusters .",
    "the top panel shows the ( x - ray ) spectroscopic - like temperature profiles , the middle panel the sz temperature profiles ( both panels show temperatures in relative to the virial temperature , @xmath35 ) and the bottom panel the ratio of the two temperatures.,width=321 ]    we also show , in fig .  [",
    "fig : meant ] ( top panel ) , how @xmath33 compares to @xmath35 when the former is measured within a projected radius @xmath40 ( as is the case with x - ray observations of clusters ) .",
    "thus , the temperature at each value of @xmath41 is a result of integrating over all gas within that radius . at @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , the typical outer radius where @xmath33 can be reliably measured with high - quality x - ray data , @xmath33 is only slightly larger ( within 10 per cent ) than its value at @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sz temperature , @xmath34 , is higher than both @xmath32 and @xmath33 in all clusters studied and is much closer to @xmath44 ( within 10 per cent ) .",
    "all clusters show that @xmath34 converges to within 20 per cent of @xmath35 at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . finally , the ratio , @xmath47 exhibits very different behaviour between the two models , but at small radius in particular , the sz temperature can be significantly ( tens of per cent ) higher than the x - ray temperature . at the virial radius , one _ non - radiative _",
    "cluster even has @xmath48 , a massive difference .",
    "figure [ fig : profs ] illustrates how the two temperatures ( @xmath49 and @xmath34 ) vary when measured locally , azimuthally - averaged at each radius . strikingly , the sz temperature profiles are very similar for both models outside @xmath50 , suggesting that this estimator is insensitive to cluster physics away from the core",
    ". when the x - ray estimator is used , the _ feedback _ clusters are systematically hotter than the _ non - radiative _ clusters at all radii ( except in the inner core , where a sharp drop occurs due to the presence of gas that has radiated a significant amount of its thermal energy ) .",
    "the bottom panel in the figure explicitly illustrates the ratio , @xmath47 , as a function of radius . in both models ,",
    "the ratio increases with radius , although the effect is milder in the _ feedback _ clusters , with @xmath34 almost a factor of two higher than @xmath33 at @xmath39 .",
    "the reason why the sz temperature is hotter than the x - ray temperature ( and closer to the virial temperature ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] , where we present maps of the two quantities ( and their ratio ) within @xmath39 for the first cluster ( nr1 and fb1 ) . in the _ non - radiative _ cluster , the map contains a significant amount of dark features , associated with infalling cooler , denser gas . since @xmath33 weights this gas higher",
    ", they make a prominent contribution to the temperature of the cluster .",
    "note that the nature of the cool gas changes in the _ feedback _ cluster .",
    "there it becomes more spot - like , associated with the cores of subhaloes ; the combination of cooling and strong feedback has removed most of the cool , low - entropy , gas in this model . the difference in the amount of cool gas in the x - ray and sz temperature maps",
    "is shown clearly in fig .",

    "the differences at the lowest temperatures are also much less significant .",

    "vertical dashed / dot - dashed lines illustrate the mean pixel value for the _ non - radiative_/_feedback _ models.,width=321 ]",
    "our results clearly show that the temperature of the icm , as measured through the sz effect , can differ significantly from the x - ray temperature of the cluster , with the sz temperature always being the larger of the two .",
    "the x - ray temperature is weighted by cool dense gas the most , so differences between the amount of cool _ clumpy _ gas due to , for example , the level of radiative cooling and feedback , are most significant . on the other hand , the sz temperature weights the hottest ,",
    "densest gas ( i.e. gas with the highest pressure ) the most , so is generally a better estimator of the virial temperature of the cluster .",
    "consequently , differences due to the amount of cooling and heating are less severe .",
    "the lower sensitivity of the sz temperature to cluster physics ( as compared to x - ray ) is in line with previous comparisons between x - ray and sz intensity ( @xcite ) .    in practice ,",
    "the sz temperature of a cluster is extremely difficult to measure , and its applicability limited to the hottest clusters , typically @xmath51 kev .",
    "it does seem feasible , however , to design multi - wavelength experiments that are able to constrain sz temperatures to @xmath52 per cent accuracy in the near future @xcite . whether an instrument will ever be able to measure the sz temperature in enough clusters , and to sufficient accuracy , to be useful for cosmological purposes ( where the virial temperature is the desired quantity , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) remains to be seen , but comparison with the x - ray temperature of a cluster ought to provide useful information on the structure of the icm .",
