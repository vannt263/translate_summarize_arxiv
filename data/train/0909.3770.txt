    "an extension of the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath1 to @xmath2 has been proposed by various authors due to its several distinctive features .",
    "for instance , electroweak unification could be obtained in an @xmath3 model with its subgroup @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the left - right symmetry limit @xcite .",
    "also , one can construct a @xmath3 model in the lepton sector in which the hypothetical large neutrino magnetic moment around @xmath6 of the bohr magneton is naturally compatible with acceptably small neutrino mass of a few @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , the gauged @xmath2 group including both quarks and leptons can provide an answer to the question why we only observe three families of fermions in nature , in a sense that anomaly cancellation is achieved when @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of families ( colors ) @xcite .",
    "a systematic way of constructing anomaly - free fermion spectra with @xmath2 gauge group has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    instead of the usual higgs mechanism , recently , the little higgs mechanism has been implemented in @xmath2 gauge group by kaplan and schmaltz ( k - s ) as an alternative solution to the hierarchy and fine - tuning issues @xcite .",
    "little higgs models ( lhms ) adopts the early idea that higgs can be considered as a nambu goldstone boson from global symmetry breaking at some higher scale @xmath10 @xcite and acquires a mass radiatively through symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale @xmath11 by collective breaking @xcite .",
    "the lhm with the @xmath2 gauge symmetry appears fundamentally different from other types of lhms due to the multiple breaking of global symmetry by separate scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the bound on the new symmetry breaking scale @xmath12 of this k - s model was obtained earlier from the tree - level electroweak constraints in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the novel feature of lhms is that higgs mass is protected by a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken and so the one - loop quadratic divergences to the higgs mass are canceled by particles of the _ same _ spin ; i.e. , a new fermion cancels a quadratic divergence from a sm fermion .",
    "the k - s model has vector - like heavy quarks of charge 2/3 for each generation with a simple family universal embedding , but this choice leaves nonvanishing quadratic divergences from light fermions and gauge anomalies which require additional fermion multiplets at the scale @xmath13 .",
    "instead , we introduce alternative fermion set with which the one - loop quadratic divergence to the higgs mass and gauge anomaly are absent at the scale @xmath12 . in our case , the cancellation of quadratic divergences is made between a sm particle and its new heavy partner not only of the _ same _ spin but also of the _ same _ electric charge so that the one - loop quadratic divergences from all fermion loops are canceled .",
    "we will explicitly show this cancellation mechanism in the next section .    in general @xmath2 models , anomaly cancellation",
    "can be achieved by embedding the first two generations of quarks into @xmath14 representations of @xmath3 while the third generation of quarks and all three generations of leptons are into @xmath15s of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the idea of adopting this alternative choice of fermion set to the lhm with simple group was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a similar study on the k - s model with @xmath16 gauge group can be found in ref .",
    "however , in order to have a proper higgs mass , the @xmath17 model requires so - called @xmath18-term that manifestly breaks the global @xmath19 symmetry and gives tree - level masses to scalar particles including higgs , which ruins the original motivation of the lhm to acquire higgs mass spontaneously @xcite . in this paper",

    "the scalar sector in @xmath0 models with little higgs is based on the non - linear sigma model describing @xmath20 ^ 4 $ ] global symmetry breaking with the diagonal @xmath21 subgroup gauged and four non - linear sigma model field @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the standard @xmath1 gauge group can be embedded into the theory with an additional @xmath24 group .",

    "we only show the two complex higgs doublets @xmath27 and discard the other singlets in @xmath28 whose contributions to fermion and gauge boson masses are negligible",

    "@xcite , so we do not repeat it here and lead the readers to the original paper . instead , in this paper , we mainly focus on the fermion and gauge boson sectors .      the covariant derivative of the scalar and fermion quadruplets is given by [ eq : covariantd ] d^=^+ ig t_a^_+ ig_x x a_x^ , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gauge bosons and couplings of the @xmath3 and @xmath24 gauge groups , respectively , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 the gell - mann matrices for @xmath3 normalized as tr@xmath33 .",

    "since this lhm has a gauged @xmath3 , the sm doublets must be expanded to @xmath3 quadruplets , and the extra fermions in the quadruplets should cancel the quadratic divergence from the sm fermion ( especially from the top ) .",

    "after symmetry breaking , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are realized as two pseudo - scalar singlets residing in the fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",

    "the quark quadruplets belong to type i , and all three generations have identical quantum numbers ( universal embedding ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , such a universal fermion sector requires additional ambiguous fermion multiplets at the scale @xmath13 in order to remove the gauge anomaly in the uv completion of the model .",
    "alternatively , one can make the lhms ( including the k - s model ) anomaly - free by taking different charge assignments for the different generations of quark multiplets ( anomaly - free embedding ) .",
    "since the type i case in the lhm was discussed already in refs @xcite ( although it is anomalous ) , we mainly focus on the type ii case in this paper .",
    "one benefit of embedding type ii ( over type i ) quark quadruplets in the lhm is that the cancellation of the quadratic divergences is even made between a light sm fermion and its heavy fermion partner of the ` same ' electric charge .",

    "using the recent experimental data , we obtained the bounds on the np scale parameter @xmath12 and the masses of @xmath123 and @xmath124 . especially , apv experiments give a strongest constraint because the contribution of the @xmath124 boson exchange is much bigger that that of @xmath123 exchange or @xmath191 mixing .",
