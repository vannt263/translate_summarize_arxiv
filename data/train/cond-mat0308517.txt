    "ybagge is the penultimate member of the hexagonal ragge series @xcite and was recently identified @xcite as a new yb - based heavy fermion compound .",
    "magnetization measurements on ybagge down to 1.8 k @xcite show moderate anisotropy ( at low temperatures @xmath3 3 ) and a loss of local moment character below @xmath4 k ( fig . [ mth ] ) .",
    "the in - plane @xmath5 at @xmath6 2 k shows a trend toward saturation whereas @xmath7 field - dependent magnetization continues to be virtually linear below 140 koe ( fig .",
    "[ mth ] , inset ) .",
    "initial thermodynamic and transport measurements down to 0.4 k @xcite reveal two magnetic transitions , a higher one at @xmath8 1 k , and a lower one , with very sharp features in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , at @xmath8 0.65 k ( fig . [ rtct ] ) .",
    "given that the magnetic entropy inferred from the fig .",
    "[ rtct ] is only @xmath11 of @xmath12 at 1 k and only reaches @xmath12 by @xmath025 k it seems likely that these transitions are associated with a small moment ordering . based on these measurements",
    "the compound was anticipated to be close to the quantum critical point .",
    "the linear component of @xmath10 , @xmath13 , is @xmath0150 mj / mol k@xmath14 between 12 k and 20 k. @xmath15 rises up to @xmath01200 mj / mol k@xmath14 for @xmath16 1 k but given the presence of the magnetic transitions below 1 k , it is difficult to unambiguously evaluate the electronic specific heat . grossly speaking , 150 mj / mol k@xmath14 @xmath17 1 j / mol k@xmath14 leading to an estimate 10 k @xmath18 100 k for the kondo temperature , @xmath19 .",
    "since the number of the yb - based heavy fermion compounds is relatively small @xcite any new member of the family attracts attention @xcite . as an up to date example , ybrh@xmath20si@xmath20 , a heavy fermion antiferromagnet @xcite , became a subject of intensive , rewarding exploration @xcite .",
    "the case of ybagge appears to have the potential of being somewhat similar to ybrh@xmath20si@xmath20 : the relatively high value of @xmath13 and the proximity of the magnetic ordering temperature to @xmath21 = 0 suggest that ybagge is close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) and make it a good candidate for a study of the delicate balance and competition between magnetically ordered and strongly correlated ground states under the influence of a number of parameters such as pressure , chemical substitution and/or magnetic field .    in this work",
    "we report the magnetic - field - induced evolution of the ground state of ybagge as seen in anisotropic resistivity and specific heat measurements up to 140 koe .",
    "we show that on increase of the applied magnetic field the progression from small moment magnetic order to qcp with the evidence of non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior and , in higher fields , to low temperature fermi - liquid ( fl ) state is observed .",

    "ybagge single crystals in the form of clean hexagonal cross section rods of several mm length and 0.3 - 0.8 mm@xmath14 cross section were grown from high temperature ternary solutions rich in ag and ge .",
    "their structure and the absence of impurity phases were confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction ( see @xcite for details of the samples growth ) .",
    "temperature and field dependent resistivity @xmath22 and heat capacity @xmath23 were measured down to 0.4 k in an applied magnetic field up to 140 koe in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument with he-3 option . for resistivity a standard ac four probe resistance technique (",

    "the background heat capacity ( sample platform and grease ) was measured for all necessary @xmath31 values and was accounted for in the final results .",

    "there are several features that apparently require detailed examination .",
    "multiple transitions in zero field is a feature that is common throughout the ragge series @xcite and in the case of ybagge in zero field in addition to the sharp transition at approximately 0.64 k another , albeit less pronounced feature is apparent at @xmath0 1 k. whereas the 0.64 k transition seems to be pushed below the base temperature of our measurements by a 20 koe field , the other feature shifts down in temperature more gradually and is seen up to 40 koe . for applied field between 60 and 90 koe ( fig .",

    "[ rtab](d ) ) increasing with the increase of applied field and the coefficient @xmath36 decreasing .    field dependent resistivity data taken at constant temperatures between 0.4 k and 5.0 k are shown in fig .",
    "[ rhab](a ) . at @xmath21",
    "= 0.4 k two fairly sharp features , at @xmath0 13 koe and @xmath0 40 koe are seen in the @xmath37 data .",
    "the lower field feature may be identified as a signature of a metamagnetic transition between two different magnetically ordered phases .",
    "this feature vanishes as the temperature increased to @xmath38 0.65 k ( fig .",
    "[ rhab](b ) ) .",
    "the second , more smoothed , higher field feature , may be to a transition from a magnetically ordered state to a saturated paramagnetic state .",
    "if the critical field for this transition is inferred from the maximum in @xmath37 , this transition can be discerned up to 0.8 - 0.9 k ( fig . [ rhab](b ) ) , consistent with it being associated with the @xmath39 k transition seen in the @xmath40 @xmath9 and @xmath10 data ( fig .",

    "[ rhab](a ) ) this feature broadens and resembles a crossover rather than a transition . for 2 k",
    "@xmath41 5 k @xmath37 looks like a generic magnetoresistance of a paramagnetic metal @xcite . the large black dots in fig .",
    "[ rhab](b ) show the evolution of the two aforementioned features .",

    "[ hcab](a ) .",

    "the higher temperature maximum seen just below 1 k ( for @xmath42 0 ) shifts down with the increase of the applied field and drops below 0.4 k for @xmath43 .",
    "the field dependence of this feature is consistent with that of the higher temperature feature in resistivity discussed above giving further evidence that ybagge has two closely - spaced magnetic transitions .",

    "the values at @xmath45 = 0.35 k@xmath14 ( a value chosen to avoid the upturn in lowest temperature , highest field @xmath47 data possibly associated with the nuclear schottky contribution ) give a reasonable approximation of @xmath48 . a more than four - fold decrease of @xmath13",
    "is observed from 60 koe to 140 koe .    the magnetic contribution to the ybagge specific specific heat ( defined as @xmath49 )",

    "( it should be noted that @xmath10 of luagge was measured at @xmath52 = 0 and 140 koe and found to be insensitive to the applied field in this temperature range . ) for intermediate values of applied field there is a region of the logarithmic divergency seen in the specific heat data @xmath53 .",
    "the largest range of the logarithmic behavior ( more than an order of magnitude in temperature , from below 1 k to above 10 k ) is observed for @xmath54 80 koe .",

    "fermi - liquid - like behavior apparently recovers , in agreement with the resistivity data .    the crossover function @xmath58 _ vs _ @xmath59 ( @xmath60 = 1.15 ) ( one of the expressions considered in the scaling analysis at a qcp ) is shown in the inset to fig . [ hcab](c ) .",
    "data for @xmath46 60 koe collapse onto one universal curve .",
    "such scaling behavior @xcite with @xmath60 between 1.05 and 1.6 was observed for a number of materials that demonstrate nfl properties @xcite and may be considered as further corroboration of the proximity of ybagge to a qcp .",
    "ybagge manifests an easy plane anisotropy in both its low - field and high - field magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ mth ] ) .",
    "this is a trend that evolves across the ragge series @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ in tmagge the local moments are extremely anisotropic being confined to the basal plane .",
    "not surprisingly this anisotropy manifests itself in the low - temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23 data .",
    "the variation of the temperature dependent resistivity for @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ rtc](a ) ) is comparable to that for @xmath1 . as for the in - plane orientation of the field , the two transitions seen for @xmath42 0 move to lower temperatures with application of magnetic field ,",
    "albeit the effect of field is weaker , so that the lower temperature transition is still being detected as a break in slope for @xmath42 20 koe whereas the higher temperature transition persists up to 80 koe ( fig .",
    "[ rtc](b ) ) . the field range for which linear , low temperature resistivity can be seen is smaller and is shifted to higher fields ( fig .",
    "[ rtc](c ) ) , whereas the @xmath61 behavior can be recognized for @xmath42 100 koe and 120 koe , and a slight upward curvature above 0.4 k is already seen at @xmath42 130 koe .",
    "the low temperature resistivity can be characterized by @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ rtc](d ) ) and this curvature can be viewed as a signature of a fl behavior .",
    "the range of @xmath45 behavior increases and the value of @xmath36 decreases with an increase of applied field . the field - dependent resistivity for this orientation of the magnetic field ( fig . [ rhc](a ) ) is similar to the set of @xmath37 isotherms for @xmath32 except for the weaker field dependence of the observed transitions ( fig .",

    "[ hcc](c ) , inset ) .",
    "for both sets of data ( @xmath32 and @xmath2 ) , at high enough applied fields , long range magnetic order is suppressed , and the electronic contribution to the specific heat can be estimated , whereas the low temperature resistivity shows @xmath67 fl - like behavior .",
    "the values of @xmath13 were estimated at @xmath68 0.35 k@xmath14 ( @xmath69 0.6 k ) and decrease with the increasing magnetic field ( fig . [ gammaa](a ) ) in a manner similar to what was observed in ybrh@xmath20si@xmath20 @xcite and other materials .",
    "although the data set is sparse , it is worth noting that an approximately 50 - 55 koe shift down of the data for @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ gammaa](a ) ) brings it into rough agreement with the @xmath1 data and so that the two sets form a universal curve .",
    "the @xmath45 coefficient of fl - like resistivity , @xmath36 , also decreases with an increase of applied field ( fig .",
    "[ gammaa](b ) ) .",
    "the shift required to have the @xmath36 data for the two @xmath52 orientations on the same curve is 30 - 25 koe .",
    "the field dependence of the kadowaki - woods ratio , @xmath70 @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ gammaa](c ) .",
    "many of the @xmath13 and @xmath36 values were reckoned for the same magnetic field . in some cases when additional values of @xmath36 were available a straightforward interpolation of @xmath71 was used .",
    "although more data points may be required to clarify these trends , several features are seen in the fig .",
    "[ gammaa ] : the obtained values of @xmath70 are of the same order of magnitude , but several times higher than @xmath0 1@xmath7210@xmath73 @xmath74 cm/(mj / mol k)@xmath14 obtained in @xcite and corroborated by the larger set of data in @xcite ; for @xmath32 the kadowaki - woods ratio decreases with an increase of the field ( not enough data is available for @xmath2 ) . though magnetotransport measurements down to lower temperatures will allow for the estimate of @xmath36 in a wider temperature range and may refine our @xmath70 data , both of the features seen in fig .",
    "[ gammaa](c ) were observed in ybrh@xmath20si@xmath20 @xcite and apparently are common for materials where nfl behavior can be induced by magnetic field .",
    "in addition , a larger value of the kadowaki - woods ratio is anticipated theoretically in the close vicinity of a magnetic instability @xcite , in agreement with our experimental data , whereas constant ( _ i.e. _ field - independent in our case ) kadowaki - woods ratio is expected only in the local critical regime @xcite .    finally , based on the thermodynamic and transport data down to @xmath0 0.4 k and up to 140 koe , we can construct tentative @xmath75 phase diagrams for the two orientations of the applied magnetic field ( fig . [ pd ] ) .",
    "both phase diagrams are very similar . initially increaseing magnetic field drives first the lower and then the higher magnetic transitions to zero . with further increase in field signatures of the nfl behavior",
    "appear in the temperature dependent resistivity ( @xmath76 ) and heat capacity ( @xmath77 ) and at our highest applied field values fl - like low temperature resistivity ( @xmath78 ) ( _ i.e. _ the coherence line @xcite on the @xmath75 phase diagram ) is observed .",
    "although the current lack of data below @xmath0 0.4 k impairs our ability to fully delineate the critical field that corresponds to @xmath6 0 qcp , a rather crude assessment of the data ( fig . [ pd ] ) suggests @xmath79 45 - 70 koe , @xmath80 80 - 110 koe .",
    "we presented results that allow for the classification of ybagge as a new heavy fermion material with magnetic field induced nfl behavior ( critical fields are @xmath79 45 - 70 koe , @xmath81 80 - 110 koe ) .",
    "although its critical fields are somewhat higher than found for the extensively studied ybrh@xmath20si@xmath20 , they are still within the range accessible by many groups .",
    "it should be mentioned that only very few _ stoichiometric _ compounds are known to demonstrate this type of behavior , making ybagge an important and interesting addition to the family of strongly correlated materials .",
    "results of this work can serve as a road map for further studies , delineating further experimental courses : macroscopic ( magnetization ) and microscopic ( neutron diffraction , @xmath82sr , moessbauer spectroscopy ) measurements at low temperatures and in applied field are desirable to clarify the nature of the magnetically ordered states in ybagge and their evolution in field ; lower temperature ( @xmath83 0.4 k ) , detailed thermodynamic and transport measurements in the vicinity of the field - induced qcp would be very helpful for the understanding of the physics of field induced nfl behavior and as a point of comparison with a number of existing theories @xcite and with other materials with similar behavior .",
