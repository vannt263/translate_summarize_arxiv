    "the exclusive vector meson photoproduction has being investigated both experimentally and theoretically in recent years as it allows to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the quarkonium masses , @xmath2 , give a perturbative scale for the problem even in the photoproduction limit .",
    "an important feature of these processes at the high energy regime is the possibility to investigate the pomeron exchange . for this energy domain hadrons and photons",
    "can be considered as color dipoles in the mixed light cone representation , where their transverse size can be considered frozen during the interaction .",
    "therefore , the scattering process is characterized by the color dipole cross section describing the interaction of those color dipoles with the nucleon / nucleus target . here ,",
    "we summarize the results presented in refs . @xcite where the exclusive production of @xmath0 and the radially excited @xmath1 mesons were studied in @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions in the lhc energy range .",
    "the theoretical framework considered is the light - cone dipole formalism , where the @xmath5 fluctuation ( color dipole ) of the incoming quasi - real photon interacts with the nucleon or nucleus target via the dipole cross section and the result is projected in the wavefunction of the observed hadron . at high energies , the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics of emissions chain to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important is expected .",
    "it is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction , the so - called parton saturation phenomenon .",
    "the transition is set by saturation scale @xmath6 , which is enhanced in the nuclear case .",
    "the predictions for @xmath7 are somewhat new as most part of predictions in literature concern only to the @xmath8 state .",
    "the exclusive meson photoproduction in hadron - hadron collisions can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and photon - target production cross section @xcite . the photon energy spectrum , @xmath9 , which depends on the photon energy @xmath10 , is well known @xcite .",
    "the rapidity distribution @xmath11 for charmonium photoproduction in @xmath3 collisions can be written down as , @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{dsigdy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the produced state with mass @xmath2 has rapidity @xmath13 and the square of the @xmath14 centre - of - mass energy is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the absorptive corrections due to spectator interactions between the two hadrons are represented by the factor @xmath16 .",
    "the photon - pomeron interaction will be described within the light - cone dipole frame , where thee probing projectile fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair with transverse separation @xmath17 ( and momentum fraction @xmath18 ) long after the interaction , which then scatters off the hadron .",
    "the cross section for exclusive photoproduction of charmonia off a nucleon target is given by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the light - cone wavefunction of the photon and of the vector meson , respectively .",
    "the bjorken variable is denoted by @xmath22 , the dipole cross section by @xmath23 and the diffractive slope parameter by @xmath24 . here , we consider the energy dependence of the slope using the regge motivated expression ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "similarly , the rapidity distribution @xmath11 in nucleus - nucleus collisions has the same factorized form , @xmath25 , \\label{dsigdya}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the photon flux in nucleus is denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( coherent case ) or @xmath28 ( incoherent case ) .",
    "the exclusive photoproduction off nuclei for coherent and incoherent processes can be simply computed in high energies where the large coherence length @xmath29 is fairly valid .",
    "the expressions for both cases are given by @xcite , @xmath30|\\psi^{\\gamma}\\rangle |^2 , \\label{eq : coher } \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma ( \\gamma a \\rightarrow \\psi(ns ) + a^ * )   & = & \\frac{1}{16\\pi\\,b_v(s)}\\int d^2b\\,t_a(b ) |\\langle \\psi^v|r_g\\sigma_{dip}(x , r ) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}r_g\\sigma_{dip}(x , r)t_a(b )   \\right]|\\psi^{\\gamma}\\rangle|^2 , \\nonumber \\label{eq : incoh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the nuclear thickness function . in the numerical evaluations , we have considered the boosted gaussian wavefunction and the phenomenological saturation model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cgc model ) which encodes the main properties of the saturation approaches . the nuclear ratio for the gluon density is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "first , we compare the study to the data measured by lhcb collaboration at 7 tev in @xmath3 collisions at the forward region @xmath33 @xcite , which cover values of bjorken-@xmath22 variable down to @xmath34 .",
    "we assume for the absorption factor the average value @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 pb for rapidity between 2 and 4.5 . in terms of muon pseudorapidities",
    "we get @xmath37 pb . this is in good agreement to the experimental result @xmath38 pb @xcite . for the @xmath7 mesons it is obtained @xmath39 pb for rapidities @xmath40 .",
    "accordingly , we now predict @xmath41 pb compared to @xmath42 pb measured value @xcite .",
    "we performed predictions for the next lhc runs in @xmath3 mode .",
    "we have found @xmath43 nb and 7.9 nb for central rapidities at energies of 8 and 14 tev , respectively . for the @xmath1 state the extrapolation gives @xmath44 nb and 1.4 nb for the same energies at central rapidity .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( left panel ) we present the calculations for the rapidity distribution of coherent @xmath8 state , using distinct scenarios for the nuclear gluon shadowing .",
    "the dot - dashed curve represents the result using @xmath45 .",
    "it overestimates the alice data @xcite on the backward ( forward ) and mainly in central rapidities .",
    "the situation is improved if we consider nuclear shadowing renormalising the dipole cross section .",
    "the reason is that the gluon density in nuclei at small bjorken @xmath22 is expected to be suppressed compared to a free nucleon due to interferences . for @xmath46 ,",
    "we have considered the theoretical evaluation of ref . @xcite . as a prediction at central rapidity , one obtains @xmath47 and @xmath48 mb for calculation using @xmath45 , model 1 ( strong shadowing ) and model 2 ( weak shadowing ) , respectively . in fig .",
