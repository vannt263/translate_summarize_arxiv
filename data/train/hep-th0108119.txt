    "de sitter spacetime is one of the simplest and most interesting spacetimes allowed by general relativity .",
    "if current indications from supernovae , cosmic microwave background and other astronomical data have been interpreted correctly , it seems that the universe we live in will in fact be asymptotically de sitter in the infinite future .",
    "de sitter spacetime also plays a central role in the theory of inflation , where an approximately de sitter spacetime , with exponential expansion , is employed to solve the cosmological flatness and horizon puzzles .",
    "the quantum mechanics of de sitter spacetime , and matter fields within it , is also of considerable interest . during inflation ,",
    "massless quantum fields acquire fluctuations on macroscopically large scales , leading to an attractive theory of the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "indeed this setup provides one of the very few direct observational probes of quantum gravity , since the gravitational waves generated during such a period of early inflation may be directly observable today through the polarization signature they produce on the cosmic microwave sky .    in this article",
    "we consider the quantization of the massless minimally coupled scalar field in de sitter spacetime and its relation to a conformal field living at the boundary .",
    "the massless case must be treated separately from the massive case due to the presence of the symmetry @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a space - time constant .",
    "this symmetry is relevant for a massless minimally coupled scalar field on any spacetime with compact spatial sections , whereas for spacetimes ( such as minkowski spacetime ) with infinite spatial sections , super - selection rules render the symmetry innocuous .",
    "as shown by allen and folacci @xcite the presence of the zero mode implies there is no de sitter invariant fock vacuum for the massless field .",
    "nevertheless there is still a de sitter invariant vacuum as shown by kirsten and garriga @xcite",
    ". we will show that it is this latter vacuum state that is naturally picked out by the no boundary euclidean prescription .",
    "recently strominger @xcite has given arguments showing that a scalar field of mass @xmath2 in @xmath3 can be related to a conformal field theory living on an @xmath4 which may be identified as the boundary ( timelike infinity ) of de sitter spacetime@xcite .",
    "this proposal was formulated in analogy with the ads / cft correspondence and arguments suggesting its existence were given in @xcite . using this correspondence it is possible to obtain information about euclidean conformal field theories from quantum gravity in de sitter spacetime@xcite .",
    "it is significant that it does not seems possible to formulate a unitary cft for the massive fields @xmath5 , suggesting that such fields may not arise in a consistent de sitter quantum gravity .",
    "we will extend strominger s analysis to the massless case and show that such fields do have a unitary cft interpretation .",
    "the scalar representations of the de sitter group @xmath6 split into three series@xcite , the principal series @xmath7 , the complementary series @xmath8 and the discrete series whose only physical interesting case is @xmath9 . under a wigner - inn contraction to the poincare group only the principal series representations contract to poincare representations and have an interpretation as particles in the limit of zero cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "strominger @xcite has shown that complementary series representations have a dual interpretation in terms of a unitary cft while the principal series representations require a non - unitary description . however , as yet the special case @xmath9 has not been treated . in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on 4 dimensional de sitter spacetime although everything can easily be generalized to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it is important to consider the _ de sitter invariant _ vacuum in order to obtain information about the conformally invariant vacuum of the dual cft , and since its structure is subtle we shall consider in detail the role of de sitter invariance .",
    "the choice of vacuum for a massive scalar field in an arbitrary spacetime is determined by the choice of complex structure @xcite .",
    "this provides a decomposition of the space of real solutions @xmath10 to the equation of motion @xmath11\\phi=0 $ ] into two complex subspaces @xmath12 such that @xmath13 has positive / negative klein - gordon norm respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is then taken to be the single - particle hilbert space @xmath15 and the hilbert space of the full theory is then taken to be the usual fock space @xmath16 . demanding that the complex structure ( and hence the vacuum ) be de sitter invariant picks out a one - parameter family of inequivalent de sitter invariant vacua . requiring that the short distance behaviour of the hadamard function should be of the same type as that in flat spacetime then uniquely fixes the vacuum .",
    "this is known as the bunch - davies or euclidean vacuum@xcite . in the massless case the klein - gordon inner product and equation of motion",
    "are invariant under the symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "allen and folacci @xcite have shown that this implies that there is no de sitter invariant complex structure and hence fock space / vacuum .",
    "the situation is analogous to qed and the resolution is to define a vacuum similar to the gupta - bleuler vacuum in qed@xcite for which de sitter invariance is recovered .",
    "consequently we need to look for a single - particle hilbert space defined as a space of positive norm solutions of the equations of motion modulo symmetry transformations .",
    "4d de sitter spacetime is topologically @xmath17 and can be covered with the metric @xmath18\\ ] ] with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "these co - ordinates are known as the closed slicing as they provide a foliation in terms of compact @xmath22 hypersurfaces .",
    "an arbitrary solution of the equations of motion can then be written as a superposition over @xmath22 eigenmodes .",
    "thus we are lead naturally to the decomposition @xmath23 @xmath24 the @xmath25 are the usual spherical harmonics defined on a 3-sphere .",
    "the @xmath26 are defined by the massless limit of the usual bunch - davies modes@xcite @xmath27\\ ] ] with @xmath28^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "note that they satisfy the reflection symmetry @xmath29 .",
    "we will denote the subspaces of solutions by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 so that the full space of solutions is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the massless minimally coupled scalar field in de sitter spacetime belongs to the so - called discrete series representation of the de sitter group @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a candidate hilbert space must have positive norm and be closed under the action of the de sitter group @xmath36 .",
    "in addition the chosen norm must be invariant , @xmath37 .",
    "the natural inner product is the klein - gordon inner product ( see appendix ) . under the action of an arbitrary element of the de sitter group @xmath38 the subspaces @xmath14 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41",
    "transform as@xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 denotes the representation of the group element @xmath38 acting on the space of solutions . to illustrate this",
    "we may construct the @xmath35 generators with the help of the embedding co - ordinates as @xmath44\\ ] ] then if we construct the following operator invariant under the @xmath45 subgroup ( see appendix ) @xmath46 this operator represents the part of the generators that generates time translations alone , it is only this part that mixes states of different @xmath47 .",
    "one observes that @xmath48 with the structure of the higher @xmath47 terms being always of the form @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that the de sitter invariant spaces are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . since the modes @xmath52 have positive norm then the hilbert space that forms the discrete series representation of the de sitter group is @xmath53 .",
    "note that the zero mode @xmath33 does not contribute to the physical state space since if it was included modes of positive norm would be transformed into modes of negative norm violating unitarity . in particular",
    "this means that only the @xmath54 modes will contribute to any physical quantity .",
    "covariant quantization begins with the fundamental quantization condition @xmath55=\\delta(x , x')\\ ] ] where the commutator function @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 times the advanced minus retarded green functions .",
    "this incorporates causality from the start and ensures that the commutator of two fields vanishes at spacelike separations .",
    "this is distinct from the canonical approach where causality is not immediately apparent and depends on which modes are included .",
    "note that @xmath56 is independent of the choice of vacuum state : that information is contained in the hadamard function we shall consider later .    in the context of de sitter spacetime @xmath56 has a smooth limit as the mass @xmath58 of the field is taken to zero .",
    "so it may be defined as the massless limit of the massive commutator is 1 ( @xmath59 ) if @xmath60 is in the future ( past ) of @xmath61 , and zero if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are space - like separated . ]",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined in the appendix .",
    "we can then examine the properties of @xmath56 in the closed coordinate system , by expanding it in terms of modes on a 3-sphere .",
    "since @xmath56 is by definition a solution of the equations of motion it must be a superposition of usual closed slicing modes .",
    "in particular this includes the normalizable zero mode",
    ". the result can be most usefully written in the form @xmath55=i\\frac{h^2}{4 \\pi^2}(f(\\tau')-f(\\tau))+w^+_n(x , x')-w^+_n(x',x)\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and can be recognized as the @xmath65 mode term @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the wightman function constructed out of only the @xmath54 modes @xmath68+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta(x , x')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",

    "the hamiltonian ( see section iv ) is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the part of the hamiltonian constructed from the @xmath79 modes . since @xmath80=0 $ ] , the operator @xmath76 is a conserved generator that generates translations in @xmath75 . in particular",
    "we see that @xmath81 where @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "the commutation relations alone do not determine the correlators in the theory : we need a prescription for picking the vacuum .",
    "in minkowski spacetime we define the vacuum to be the state annihilated by the positive energy part of the field .",
    "but since there is no global timelike killing vector in de sitter spacetime , there is no global definition of positive energy , so the same prescription can not be applied .",
    "there are three natural choices for the vacuum :    \\(i ) the de sitter invariant vacuum ;    \\(ii ) the @xmath83 invariant vacuum only tells us how to quantize the @xmath65 mode ] ;    \\(iii ) the euclidean vacuum .    to determine the de sitter invariant state consider a single particle state generated by the action of the physical ( @xmath83-invariant ) operator @xmath84 @xmath85 we have already argued that if the single particle states are to form a representation of the de sitter group , the @xmath65 modes can not contribute .",
    "since the @xmath75 operator naturally cancels in constructing a @xmath83 invariant operator the @xmath65 contribution is linear in @xmath86 and so de sitter invariance demands @xmath87 .",
    "alternatively we may see that the requirement that action of a de sitter group element on a single particle state should not generate an @xmath65 mode implies @xmath88 we may also look for the state invariant under the symmetry @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 and hence @xmath87 . in what follows",
    "we refer to the vacuum defined by @xmath90 as the kirsten - garriga ( k - g ) vacuum .",
    "we shall show that this is equivalent to the euclidean vacuum .",
    "we begin by looking at the problem in the schrdinger representation . the wavefunction @xmath91 $ ] satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath92 with time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath93\\ ] ] where the canonical pair @xmath94 satisfy the usual canonical commutation relations on a 3-sphere .",
    "to elucidate we can expand each of the fields in terms of modes on an @xmath22 with the result that the hamiltonian is given by @xmath95\\ ] ] with @xmath96 . following kirsten and garriga @xcite",
    ", we may look for a gaussian solution of the schrdinger equation of the form @xmath97 where @xmath98\\ ] ] one can show that this is a solution to the schrdinger equation providing the @xmath99 satisfy @xmath100 along with @xmath101 and @xmath102 constant .",
    "the above equation for the modes @xmath99 is just the classical equations of motion . until we specify",
    "which set of solutions to this equation to take we do not have an explicit solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "kirsten and garriga go on to determine the appropriate vacuum wavefunctional from the annihilation condition of the wavefunction by the annihilation operators for the de sitter vacuum .",
    "the problem of the choice of vacuum becomes the problem of what are the boundary conditions one should impose on @xmath103 .",
    "one choice is that of the euclidean no - boundary proposal @xcite , which by analogy with ordinary quantum mechanics ( such as a harmonic oscillator ) demands that the wavefunction be regular when time is continued to imaginary values . in de sitter spacetime ,",
    "the most obvious continuation is @xmath104 which takes the de sitter metric to that for @xmath105 .",
    "we must also analytically continue the solution of the schrdinger equation into one half of the euclidean @xmath105 .",
    "this is achieved with @xmath106 @xmath107\\ ] ] here the @xmath99 satisfy the euclidean equation of motion .",
    "we now demand that @xmath103 is real and is regular over bottom half of the @xmath105 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "now for @xmath109 we require @xmath110 over the bottom half of the @xmath105 to ensure the convergence of the wave - function normalization .",
    "the reflection symmetry of the manifold means that the solutions are naturally split for @xmath111 into modes with @xmath112 and with @xmath113 .",
    "in fact the two sets of modes are , upon analytic continuation , just the bunch - davies modes defined earlier with the reflection property @xmath114 .",
    "so if we choose @xmath115 , we guarantee that the exponent in ( 22 ) is negative , so the wavefunction is normalizable .    for @xmath65",
    "the most general solution is @xmath116 for which @xmath117 .",
    "the probability @xmath118 has an overall factor of @xmath119 .",
    "it is easy to see that for nonzero @xmath120 , @xmath121 vanishes somewhere in the euclidean region @xmath108 . therefore if , as demanded in the no boundary prescription , the wavefunction is to be regular in the euclidean region , we must have @xmath122 giving @xmath123 .",
    "in other words the wavefunction is in a momentum eigenstate with @xmath124 .",
    "thus regularity of the euclidean wavefunction picks out the k - g vacuum .",
    "alternatively we may think in a completely covariant point of view and consider the euclidean green s function equation @xmath125 .",
    "as it stands this equation does not make any sense since the @xmath83 symmetry means that @xmath126 is not invertible .",
    "we can see this by integrating over the 4-sphere , the left hand side vanishes as it is a boundary term while the right is unity by definition . to make sense of the formula one must project out the lowest @xmath105 spherical harmonic mode , i.e. the constant mode , from the delta function mode previously discussed which is the lowest @xmath22 spherical harmonic . ] .",
    "the solution for the green s function is then @xmath127 which integrates to zero over the @xmath105 .",
    "analytic continuation into the lorentzian manifold and symmetrization over @xmath60 and @xmath61 gives the effective hadamard function @xmath128 note that this is not a solution of the equations of motion , because we projected the constant mode out of the delta function .",
    "but in fact @xmath129 differs from the symmetric two point function @xmath130 constructed from @xmath54 modes only by the term @xmath131 and it is easy to see that @xmath132 which implies that any correlators of _ derivatives _ of the scalar field ( from which all physical observables can be constructed ) will be identical to those obtained with only the @xmath133 modes .",
    "in particular this applies to the expectation value of the stress energy tensor , which is defined by taking the limit as @xmath134 , and performing a covariant subtraction . since the zero mode contributes a term linear in @xmath135 to the stress energy it follows that this stress - energy corresponds exactly to the value calculated in the @xmath87 vacuum@xcite . in conclusion one",
    "may define the theory in the euclidean regime with the @xmath105 zero mode projected and one obtains identical results for all physical correlators as those obtained using the k - g vacuum .",
    "the de sitter / cft correspondence has been fueled by the hope that it might make sense of quantum gravity in de sitter spacetime .",
    "motivated by the fact that it does not seems possible to obtain de sitter spacetime as a solution of supergravity theories @xcite ( for recent work on evading these no - go theorems see @xcite and references therein ) , it has been proposed that the hilbert space describing quantum gravity with a positive cosmological constant should be finite dimensional @xcite .",
    "witten has suggested that this problem might be tackled by looking for a correspondence between quantum gravity on asymptotically de sitter spacetimes and a conformal field theory living on the boundary of de sitter spacetime . the conformal field theory",
    "may then be used to define what we mean by quantum gravity with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "as far as we are concerned here this correspondence proposes a relation between the correlators of fields in de sitter spacetime and those of a cft . since this article appeared on the archive a number of papers on the proposed de sitter / cft correspondence",
    "have been published ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in reference",
    "@xcite a connection was found between scalar field theory correlators in de sitter and correlators of scalar operators in a dual cft .",
    "ultimately this correspondence should be embedded into a solution of m - theory in analogy with maldacena s proposal of the duality between large @xmath136 , @xmath137 super - yang - mills and low energy @xmath138 string theory compactified on @xmath139@xcite .",
    "the low energy effective action of the candidate solution may be taken to be of the form @xmath140\\ ] ] where @xmath141 denote a set of scalar fields and we have discarded vector and fermionic fields .",
    "non - minimal coupling to gravity that may arise through the dilaton or from dimensional reduction has been absorbed by passing to einstein frame .",
    "the hope is to find a de sitter like solution @xmath142 for which @xmath143 and @xmath144 . in the region of this minimum",
    "we may expand the potential as @xmath145 where we have shifted the fields so that @xmath146 .",
    "thus if we consider asymptotically de sitter spacetimes the behaviour of the scalar fields may be approximated by massive free fields .",
    "the effective masses @xmath147 are related to the renormalization group beta functions of the dual field theory on the boundary that describe non - conformal effects .",
    "an exception to this occurs if the potential has a flat direction so that @xmath148 . in this case",
    "the effective mass in the @xmath149 direction is zero and if it is also true that @xmath150 the field @xmath149 will behave like a massless minimally coupled scalar field in de sitter spacetime .",
    "following strominger we consider a massive scalar field in de sitter spacetime using the flat co - ordinates @xmath151 ( see figure 1 . ) .",
    "future infinity @xmath152 lies at @xmath153 and @xmath154 is the horizon .",
    "the equation of motion has the form @xmath155 the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at future infinity is @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "the hadamard function for the massive field is given by @xmath158 \\gamma[a_-]}{8 \\pi^2 } { } _ 2f_1[a_+,a_-;2;\\frac{1}{2}(1+z)]\\ ] ] where @xmath159 .",
    "given a general solution with asymptotic form @xmath160 the two point correlator of the cft can be obtained from considering the amplitude @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the hadamard function .",
    "the choice of cauchy surfaces is arbitrary but by taking them to future infinity one can show that the above amplitude is given by    @xmath163    where @xmath164 are constants .",
    "this shows that the @xmath165 modes are dual to a conformal field theory operator @xmath166 of dimension @xmath167 while the @xmath168 modes are dual to an operator @xmath169 of dimension @xmath170 , so that @xmath171 .    an important difference between ds / cft and ads / cft",
    "is that in the former there are no non - normalizable modes in the bulk . in the ads",
    "/ cft picture it is the non - normalizable modes in the bulk that are dual to sources on the boundary whilst normalizable modes are dual to fields . in the ds / cft case there are only normalizable modes giving rise to two conformal fields on the boundary of different dimension . whether both fields are included depends on the choice of asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "we shall consider here the most general form of boundary conditions .",
    "the above reasoning does not apply in the @xmath172 limit . as we shall see the asymptotic behaviour in this limit changes .",
    "furthermore the hadamard function is infinite in the de sitter vacuum . despite these problems",
    "one can still make sense of this correspondence .",
    "a real solution of the equations of motion may be expressed in a complete set of modes @xmath173 with @xmath174 with @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "then one can show that above amplitude is given by @xmath177 now since the flat slicing modes are well defined in the massless limit then the amplitude is still well defined .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the modes at future infinity is given by @xmath178 it then remains only to relate @xmath179 in terms of @xmath180 , the fourier transform of @xmath181 .",
    "the result is @xmath182 and so @xmath183 is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 the second correlator @xmath186 exhibits the same infrared divergence as the de sitter wightman function , and we have chosen to separate out an infinite constant @xmath187 to see the physical behaviour .",
    "a similar behaviour occurs for a massless field in two dimensions , for instance as occurs in string theory . in that case",
    "the divergence comes from the symmetry @xmath188 , i.e. translation invariance on the target space .",
    "the result is that @xmath189 is not a primary operator but its derivatives @xmath190 are . in the euclidean formulation where the worldsheet is taken to be an @xmath191",
    "the divergence comes entirely from the @xmath65 @xmath191 spherical harmonic term and can be projected out , the result is a logarithmic correlation function . in view of these similarities",
    "we see that the holographic dual of a massless minimally coupled scalar field in @xmath3 contains two conformal fields @xmath166 and @xmath169 , one primary with conformal weight @xmath192 and correlator @xmath193 and a second non - primary field @xmath169 , having global symmetry @xmath194 and correlator @xmath195 whose derivatives are primary fields .",

    "one is free to use either future or past infinity as the boundary .",
    "it is unnecessary to use both since the fields at future infinity are completely determined by specifying @xmath200 and @xmath52 at past infinity .",
    "it is for this reason that only one copy of a cft is needed .",
    "this reflects the fact that the holographic dual of the bulk lives not so much on the boundary but rather on the effective cauchy surface .",
    "we shall define the holographic dual at future infinity for ease of comparison with the flat slicing case . in order to give a finite amplitude we choose a @xmath70 such that @xmath201 it is significant that the @xmath65 mode has not been included .",
    "this allows us to work with manifestly finite expressions .",

    "note that the infinite constant that occurred in the flat slicing correlator has been automatically projected out by imposing the condition ( e.q .",

    "the second field exhibits the same global symmetry and infrared divergence as the massless field in de sitter and we argue that this apparent problem should have the same resolution , namely that one should think in terms of physical correlators for which the infrared divergence is removed . it is well known that the graviton in de sitter spacetime considered in physical gauge in the flat slicing behaves like a massless minimally coupled scalar field @xcite and so we anticipate that a similar approach will be needed in this case .",
