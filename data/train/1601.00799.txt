    "heavy quarks are predominantly produced in hard scatterings on a short time - scale and traverse the surrounding medium interacting with its constituents .",
    "thus the production of hadrons containing heavy quark(s ) is a particularly useful tool to probe transport properties of hot matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the modern pattern of multi - particle production in central heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies supposes the formation of hot strongly - interacting matter with hydrodynamical properties ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) , which absorbs energetic quarks and gluons due to their multiple scattering and medium - induced energy loss ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . within such paradigm , a number of questions related to heavy flavor production is definitely of interest .",
    "are heavy quarks thermalized in quark - gluon plasma ?",
    "are charmed hadrons and charmonia in a kinetic equilibrium with the created medium ? what is the interplay between thermal and non - thermal mechanisms of hidden and open charm production ?",
    "interesting measurements at the lhc involving momentum and centrality dependencies of charmed meson and charmonium production and its azimuthal anisotropy in pbpb collisions at center - of - mass energy 2.76 tev per nucleon pair have been done by alice  @xcite atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations . at",
    "that a number of theoretical calculations and monte - carlo simulations in different approaches were attempted to reproduce these data  @xcite .",
    "note that the simultaneous description of momentum spectra ( nuclear modification factors ) and elliptic flow coefficients of charmed mesons is currently a challenging problem for most theoretical models . in this paper ,",
    "the lhc pbpb data on momentum spectra and elliptic flow of charmed mesons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and @xmath0 mesons are analyzed and interpreted within two - component hydjet++ model  @xcite . among other heavy ion event generators ,",
    "hydjet++ focuses on the simulation of the jet quenching effect taking into account medium - induced radiative and collisional partonic energy loss ( hard `` non - thermal '' component ) , and reproducing the main features of nuclear collective dynamics by the parametrization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( soft `` thermal '' component ) .",
    "it has been shown in the previous papers  @xcite that the model is able to reproduce the lhc data on various physical observables measured in pbpb collisions at @xmath5 tev , such as centrality and pseudorapidity dependence of inclusive charged particle multiplicity , transverse momentum spectra of inclusive and identified ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) hadrons , @xmath9 femtoscopic correlation radii , momentum and centrality dependencies of elliptic and higher - order harmonic coefficients , dihadron angular correlations and event - by - event fluctuations of anisotropic flow .",
    "the next step is to apply this model for phenomenological analysis of lhc data on open ( @xmath1 mesons ) and hidden ( @xmath0 mesons ) charm production .",
    "hydjet++ is a model of relativistic heavy ion collisions which includes two independent components : the soft hydro - type state ( `` thermal '' component ) and the hard state resulting from the medium - modified multi - parton fragmentation ( `` non - thermal '' component ) .",
    "when the monte - carlo generation of both components in each heavy ion collision is completed , the overall final particle spectrum is formed by natural way as the junction of these two independent event outputs .",
    "the details of the model and corresponding simulation procedure can be found in the hydjet++ manual  @xcite .",
    "main features of the model are listed below as follows .",
    "the soft component represents the hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parametrization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted event generator fast mc  @xcite ) .",
    "it is supposed that a hydrodynamic expansion of the fireball ends by a sudden system breakup ( `` freeze - out '' ) at given temperature @xmath10",
    ". thermal production of charmed hadrons is treated within the statistical hadronization approach  @xcite .",
    "the momentum spectrum of produced hadrons retains the thermal character of the ( partially ) equilibrated lorentz invariant distribution function in the fluid element rest frame : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hadron energy in the fluid element rest frame , @xmath13 is the spin degeneracy factor , @xmath14 is the charm enhancement factor ( or charm fugacity ) , and @xmath15 is the number of charm quarks and antiquarks in a hadron @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the signs @xmath18 in the denominator account for the quantum statistics of a fermion or a boson , respectively .",
    "the fugacity @xmath19 takes into account the enhanced yield of charmed hadrons and charmonia as compared with its thermal number .",
    "note that the recombination of @xmath20 pairs to @xmath0-mesons during the hadronization stage is effectively taken into account within such an approach .",
    "the fugacity can be treated as a free parameter of the model , or calculated through the number of charm quark pairs obtained from perturbative qcd and multiplied by the number of nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions .",
    "the mean charmed hadron and charmonium multiplicities @xmath21 are determined through the corresponding thermal numbers using the effective volume approximation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thermal ( equilibrium ) density of hadrons of type @xmath16 at the temperature @xmath10 , and @xmath24 is the total effective volume of hadron emission from the hypersurface of proper time @xmath25=const .",
    "the latter is calculated at given impact parameter @xmath26 of a heavy ion collision as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are longitudinal ( gaussian ) and transverse ( linear ) flow rapidity profiles respectively , @xmath30 is the fireball transverse radius in the azimuthal direction @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the momentum anisotropy parameter ( the hydro - inspired parametrization  @xcite is implemented in hydjet++ for the momentum and spatial anisotropy of a thermal hadron emission source ) .",
    "since @xmath24 is a functional of the field of collective velocities on the freeze - out hypersurface , in fact the hadron spectrum is constructed as the superposition of thermal distribution and collective flow .",
    "the simulation procedure includes generation of a hadron four - momentum in the liquid element rest frame in accordance with the equilibrium distribution function , generation of a spatial position and local four - velocity of the liquid element in accordance with the phase space and the character of fluid motion , boost of the hadron four - momentum in the event center - of - mass frame , and finally two- and three - body decays of resonances with branching ratios taken from the share particle decay table  @xcite . at first",
    "the value @xmath24 is calculated for central collisions ( @xmath33 ) , and then for non - central collisions it is supposed to be proportional to the mean number of nucleons - participants at given @xmath26 .",
    "the event - by - event simulation of hadron production assumes the poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value for each hadron species .",
    "the scenario with different chemical and thermal freeze - outs is implemented in hydjet++ .",
    "it means that particle number ratios are fixed at chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath34 , while the effective thermal volume @xmath24 and hadron momentum spectra being computed at thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath35 .",
    "introducing the temperature of chemical freeze - out ( lower than hadronization temperature @xmath36 ) and the temperature of thermal freeze - out effectively trace the stages of inelastic ( between @xmath36 and @xmath34 ) and elastic ( between @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) hadronic rescatterings .",
    "thus lower value of @xmath37 with respect to @xmath34 would indicate on separate chemical and thermal freeze - out for given hadrons species .",
    "such simplified but fast freeze - out approach is different from the simulation of full hadron cascade evolution requiring huge computing efforts .",
    "the approach for the hard component is based on the pyquen jet quenching model  @xcite modifying the nucleon - nucleon collisions generated with pythia@xmath386.4 event generator  @xcite .",
    "the basic kinetic equation for partonic energy loss @xmath39 as a function of initial energy @xmath40 and path length @xmath41 has the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the current transverse coordinate of a parton , @xmath44 is the energy loss per unit length , @xmath45 is the in - medium mean free path , @xmath46 is the medium density at the temperature @xmath10 , @xmath47 is the integral cross section for the parton interaction in the medium .",
    "the radiative energy loss of massless quark is computed within bdmps model  @xcite as @xmath48   \\>\\ln{\\left| \\cos{(\\omega_1\\tau_1 ) } \\right|}~ , \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{i \\left ( 1 - x + \\frac{c_{\\rm r}}{3}x^2 \\right )     \\bar{\\kappa}\\ln{\\frac{16}{\\bar{\\kappa}}}}~,~~   \\bar{\\kappa } = \\frac{\\mu_{\\rm d}^2\\lambda_{\\rm g}}{\\omega(1-x ) } ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the fraction of the quark energy carried away by the radiated gluon , @xmath51 is the qcd running coupling constant for @xmath52 active quark flavors , @xmath53 is the quark color factor , and @xmath54 is the debye screening mass . the simple generalization of the formula ( [ radiat ] ) for a heavy quark of mass @xmath55 is based on the `` dead - cone '' approximation  @xcite : @xmath56    the collisional energy loss due to elastic scatterings is calculated in the high - momentum transfer limit  @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the momentum transfer square , and the dominant contribution to the differential scattering cross section is @xmath59 for the scattering of a hard quark with energy @xmath40 and mass @xmath55 off the `` thermal '' parton with energy @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 scatterings respectively .",
    "the integrated cross section @xmath47 is regularized by the debye screening mass squared @xmath65 .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer square is @xmath66 [ s-(m_{\\rm q}-m_0)^2 ] / s$ ] where @xmath67 .",
    "note that a number of more recent and sophisticated developments in partonic energy loss calculations ( for massless partons as well as for heavy quarks ) are available in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for the overview ) .",
    "for example , our simplification is that the collisional energy loss due to elastic scatterings with low momentum transfer ( resulting mainly from the interactions with quark - gluon plasma collective modes or color background fields ) is not taken into account . in principle , in the majority of estimations , latter process does not contribute much to the total collisional loss in comparison with the high - momentum scattering , and in numerical computations it can be effectively `` absorbed '' by means of redefinition of minimum momentum transfer used to regularize the integral elastic cross section .",
    "anyway , the treatment of radiative and collisional energy loss within hydjet++ is used in current study mainly just to illustrate the influence of non - thermal component on charm production features .",
    "the medium where partonic rescattering occurs is treated as a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding perfect quark - gluon fluid , and the partons as being produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the strength of partonic energy loss in pyquen is determined mainly by the initial maximal temperature @xmath68 of the hot fireball in central pbpb collisions , which is achieved in the center of nuclear overlapping area at mid - rapidity . the transverse energy density in each point inside the nuclear overlapping zone is supposed to be proportional to the impact - parameter dependent product of two nuclear thickness functions @xmath69 in this point .",
    "monte - carlo simulation procedure in pyquen includes generation of the initial parton spectra with pythia and production vertices at given impact parameter , rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense zone , radiative and collisional energy loss per rescattering , final hadronization with the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "the pyquen multi - jet state is generated according to the binomial distribution , and then included in the hard component of hydjet++ event .",
    "the mean number of jets ( including heavy quark pairs ) produced in aa events at a given impact parameter @xmath26 is computed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , calculated with pythia , is the differential cross section of the hard process in nn collisions with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the transverse distances between the centres of colliding nuclei and the jet production vertex .",
    "the partons produced in hard processes with the momentum transfer lower than @xmath74 are considered as `` thermalized '' .",
    "so , their hadronization products ( including @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons ) are presented `` automatically '' in the soft component .",
    "the contribution of hard component into the total multiplicity is controlled by the parameter @xmath74 . the dominant contribution into charmed meson and",
    "charmonim yields comes from the soft component , the hard component being important at high @xmath75 .",
    "the prompt and non - prompt @xmath0 fractions for the hard component are taken from pythia with subsequent modification of non - prompt @xmath0 meson spectra due to medium - induced b - quark energy loss simulated via pyquen .",
    "the factor @xmath76 in  ( [ numjets ] ) takes into account the effect of nuclear shadowing on parton distribution functions ( pdf ) .",
    "it is computed using the impact parameter dependent parametrization  @xcite obtained in the framework of glauber - gribov theory .",
    "note that nuclear shadowing corrections are introduced only for hard component , while the soft component modeling does not use pdf explicitly .",
    "the input parameters of hydjet++ for soft and hard components have been tuned from fitting to heavy ion data on various observables for inclusive hadrons at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that using the same values for the @xmath0 thermal and chemical freeze - out temperatures ( with reduced radial and longitudinal collective velocities ) allows hydjet++ to properly reproduce @xmath75- and @xmath77-spectra measured by phenix collaboration  @xcite in central auau collisions at rhic energy @xmath78 gev .",
    "note that the early thermal freeze - out of @xmath0-mesons was already suggested some years ago to describe sps pbpb data at beam energy 158 gev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "one may argue that this is due to the higher mass and lower interaction cross section of the heavy mesons .",
    "we also have checked that @xmath75-spectrum of @xmath1-mesons measured by star collaboration  @xcite in central auau collisions at @xmath78 gev is reproduced by hydjet++ simulation with the same freeze - out parameters as for @xmath0-mesons , but not for inclusive hadrons .",
    "it means that @xmath1-mesons like @xmath0-mesons are not in a kinetic equilibrium with the created medium at rhic .",
    "then let us get a look at the lhc situation .",
    "as it was already mentioned in previous section , the input parameters of hydjet++ have been tuned from fitting to pbpb data at @xmath5 tev for inclusive hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the most important parameters for our current consideration are the chemical and thermal freeze - out temperatures , @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev , maximal longitudinal and transverse flow rapidities , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , minimal transverse momentum transfer of initial hard scatterings @xmath83 gev/@xmath84 , and initial maximal temperature of quark - gluon fluid @xmath85 gev .",
    "pythia@xmath386.4 tune pro - q20 has been used to simulate an initial partonic state of the hard component .",
    "this tune reproduces the lhc data on inclusive hadron momentum spectra in pp collisions with the 1015% accuracy in the full measured @xmath75-range  @xcite .",

    "the fugacity value @xmath93 was fixed from absolute @xmath0 yields .",
    "one can see that the situation is similar to rhic : simulated spectra match the data ( up to @xmath94 gev/@xmath84 ) only assuming early thermal freeze - out , which happens presumably at the phase of chemical freeze - out ( with reduced collective velocities , and enhanced contribution of non - thermal component ) .",
    "note that we did not tune pythia specially for charmonium production .",
    "this is the important but rather specific task which is out of the scope of current paper .",
    "we have checked that the pythia version used for our simulations indeed underestimates the charmonium yield measured by alice in pp collisions at @xmath95 tev  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is responsible for the disagreement between hydjet++ and the pbpb data at high @xmath75 , where the contribution from hard component becomes significant .",
    "in addition , we found that the @xmath75-dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath96 measured by alice for inclusive @xmath0 s  @xcite is reproduced by hydjet++ simulation in the case of early freeze - out ( figure  [ jpsi_v2 ] ) .",
    "an important role of non - thermal component at high @xmath75 is clearly seen .",
    "thus we conclude that the significant part of @xmath0-mesons ( up to @xmath94 gev ) produced in pbpb collisions at the lhc is thermalized , but without being in kinetic equilibrium with the medium ( similar to the rhic case ) .",
