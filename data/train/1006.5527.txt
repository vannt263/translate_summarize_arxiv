    "soft materials such as colloidal suspensions , emulsions and surfactant phases typically exhibit increasingly slow relaxation dynamics as a result of particle crowding or because of strong interactions , either attractive or repulsive  @xcite .",
    "work in the past years has shown that a feature shared by most of these systems is the heterogenous character of their slow dynamics , which result from rearrangements that are localized in space and intermittent in time  @xcite , in analogy with molecular glass formers  @xcite and driven athermal grains and foams  @xcite .",
    "for colloidal hard spheres , probably the most studied soft matter model system exhibiting a glass transition  @xcite , the size @xmath0 of dynamical clusters undergoing correlated rearrangements has been shown to grow with volume fraction on approaching the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "for supercooled samples whose dynamics are stationary , the growth is however modest , the largest reported values of @xmath0 being of the order of a few particle sizes  @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reported for weakly attractive systems  @xcite .",
    "this agrees with numerical and experimental findings for molecular glass formers  @xcite and grains  @xcite .",
    "although the debate is still very active on whether or not the glass and the jamming transitions coincide in thermal hard spheres  @xcite , and thus on how far the regime where @xmath0 grows may extend , it is unlikely that significantly larger correlation lengths may be measured in the supercooled regime .",
    "recent experiments using time - resolved light scattering methods suggest that this scenario could be very different for a wide range of soft materials quenched in a nearly - arrested , out - of - equilibrium state , which we shall refer to ( somehow loosely ) as jammed soft systems . in these experiments , very large temporal fluctuations of the intensity autocorrelation function were observed  @xcite , suggesting that the size of regions undergoing correlated rearrangements may be a sizeable fraction of the scattering volume , i.e. that they may extend over macroscopic distances . indeed , direct measurements of @xmath0 in a strongly attractive colloidal gel  @xcite and in concentrated soft particles  @xcite have shown that in these systems the correlation length of the dynamics is limited essentially only by the system size .    in this paper , we present data on a variety of soft jammed systems , showing that extremely long ranged correlations of the dynamics in jammed systems are the rule rather than the exception .",
    "the systems investigated include hard and soft spheres , colloidal gels made of attractive particles , biomimetic protein films , a concentrated surfactant solution ( `` onion '' phase ) and laponite suspensions : with the exception of the supercooled hard spheres , @xmath0 always exceeds 1 millimeter , much larger than any structural length scale .",
    "we discuss the role of both the strength and the microscopic origin of the elasticity in shaping spatial correlations of the dynamics and compare our results to the behavior of jammed materials under shear  @xcite .",
    "although dynamic light scattering ( dls ) is now a popular and well established technique to probe the dynamics of soft materials  @xcite , its usefulness to measure dynamical heterogeneity has been limited until recently by the spatial and temporal averages usually involved in dls measurements . in this section",
    ", we briefly recall the main features of a series of dls time- and space - resolved methods that we have introduced in the past years .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    _ time resolved correlation ( trc)_. valuable information on spatial correlations of the dynamics can be obtained in time - resolved measurements , even if they lack spatial resolution . intuitively , this is due to the fact that temporal fluctuations of the dynamics are enhanced if the probed sample volume contains a limited number of statistically independent regions , as is the case when the dynamics are correlated over large distances  @xcite .",
    "more formally , a dynamical susceptibility @xmath1 can be introduced  @xcite , which quantifies temporal fluctuations of the dynamics , and which is proportional to the volume integral of the spatial correlation of the dynamics , @xmath2  @xcite . in our dls experiments ,",
    "we achieve temporal resolution by using a ccd camera as a detector and by averaging the intensity correlation function over pixels rather than over time .",
    "the ccd is placed in the far field , so that each pixel is illuminated by light issued from the whole scattering volume at a well defined scattering angle @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics are probed on a length scale @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the scattering vector and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the solvent refractive index and the in - vacuo wave length of the laser that illuminates the sample , respectively .",
    "we measure a time - resolved intensity correlation function ( proportional to the square of the dynamic structure factor ) , defined as @xmath8 which we refer to as the degree of correlation . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci ] ) , @xmath9 indicates the scattered intensity measured by the @xmath10-th pixel and the averages are taken over the whole ccd detector .",
    "the average dynamics and dynamical heterogeneity are quantified by @xmath11 = < c_i(t,\\tau)^2>_t - < c_i(t,\\tau)>^2_t\\ , , \\label{eq : g2andchi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where averages are taken over time and where @xmath12 is the usual intensity correlation function measured in dls , while @xmath13 is the equivalent for dls of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath1 used in numerical works .",
    "note however that , contrary to @xmath1 , @xmath13 is not normalized with respect to the number of particles in the scattering volume , a quantity not always easily accessible experimentally .    _ photon correlation imaging ( pci ) .",
    "_ spatial resolution may be achieved by modifying the collection optics so as to form an image of the scattering volume onto the ccd detector .",
    "this method , which we have termed photon correlation imaging ( pci ) , has been described for a low-@xmath14 setup in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] we show its implementation for @xmath15 ( a ) and 180 ( b ) degrees , as in the experiments reported here . in both cases , an image of the illuminated sample",
    "is formed onto the ccd with magnification @xmath16 , using light scattered within a small solid angle centered around a well defined scattering angle .",
    "the resulting image has a speckled appearance similar to that of conventional far - field scattering experiments . in practice , one adjusts the diaphragm aperture so as to roughly match the speckle size to the pixel size , which is typically of the order of @xmath17 m . under these conditions , the speckle size is larger than the typical size of the scatterers ( @xmath18 m ) , which thus can not be resolved individually .",
    "information on the local dynamics , however , can still be obtained , because the relative motion of the scatterers results in fluctuations of the intensity of each speckle , as in regular dls .",
    "in contrast to conventional dls , here each speckle is illuminated by light issued from a well defined , small region of the sample , so that spatially - resolved dynamics can be measured .    in practice",
    ", we divide the ccd images in regions of interest ( rois ) , each corresponding to a small volume in the sample , and apply the trc method separately to each roi .",
    "we compute a space- and time - resolved degree of correlation , defined as @xmath19 where the average is now over all pixels within a roi corresponding to a small volume centered around @xmath20 .",
    "the rois must contain at least about 100 speckles for the statistical noise on the local degree of correlation to be acceptable : this limits the resolution of the method , which should be regarded as a coarse - grained technique .",
    "the main advantage of pci is to decouple the size of the field of view ( dictated by the magnification @xmath21 ) from the length scale @xmath22 over which the dynamics are probed ( dictated by @xmath14 and thus the scattering angle ) .",
    "thus , very restrained motion can be measured with a large field of view .",
    "this is not the case for conventional imaging methods , where @xmath22 is a fixed fraction of the field of view .",
    "the spatial correlation of the dynamics may be quantified by comparing the temporal evolution of the local degree of correlation calculated , for a given lag , for different locations .",
    "traces corresponding to pairs of regions with correlated dynamics will exhibit similar fluctuations , while uncorrelated rois yield independent fluctuations of @xmath23 .",
    "an example that will be discussed towards the end of this paper is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : laponite ] .",

    "this is the analogous , albeit at a coarse grained level , of the spatial correlation of the dynamics calculated in numerical and experimental work where particle trajectories are accessible  @xcite . in most cases , the dynamics are isotropic and we average @xmath26 over all orientations of @xmath27 .    an important point concerns the normalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g4tilde ] ) : we recall that @xmath23 contains a noise contribution due to the statistical noise associated with the finite number of pixels processed for each roi  @xcite . in pci experiments , this contribution may be quite large , since one typically tries to reduce the size of the rois as much as possible in order to achieve a better spatial resolution .",
    "distinct rois have uncorrelated noise ; as a result , the numerator of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g4tilde ] ) is noise - free ( except for @xmath28 ) , while the noise contributes to the denominator by increasing its value .",
    "thus , at spatial lags @xmath29 @xmath26 is depressed because of the noise contribution , an effect that depends on the size of the rois used for the analysis . for systems that exhibit a finite spatial correlation of the dynamics at @xmath30",

    ". this behavior is due to the fact that , for these materials , water acts as a plasticizer , lowering their glass transition temperature below room temperature at high rh .",
    "the `` artificial skin '' is a protein - based thin film ( @xmath36 m ) that mimics the properties of human stratum corneum .",
    "we mount a piece of the film on a circular frame of 10 mm of diameter to keep it flat and place it in a sealed custom - made cell that allows the relative humidity ( rh ) to be controlled during the pci measurements .",
    "the desired value of the rh is imposed by placing a saturated solution of a suitable salt in a reservoir contained in the cell .",
    "we present here results for two saturated salt solutions ( prepared by adding 20% more in weight fraction than the solubility limit at @xmath37c ) , yielding a humid ( rh = 62% , using ki ) and a dry ( rh = 12% , using licl ) atmosphere , respectively .",

    "this `` noisiness '' is due to enhanced dynamical heterogeneity , as compared to the humid sample : as discussed below , the dynamics of the dry sample are intermittent in time and correlated in space over very large distances : as a result , the temporal and spatial averages performed in calculating @xmath12 are poorer than for the humid sample . in both panels ,",

    "[ fig : asg2]a suggest that the dynamics for the humid sample are mildly heterogeneous and that the noise contribution dominates the measured @xmath13 , with the exception of the small peak around @xmath68 sec . by contrast , the dynamical susceptibility of the dry sample presents a well - developed peak , about a factor of three higher than the short-@xmath67 value of the dynamical susceptibility and more than a decade higher than @xmath13 at large delay times .",

    "we focus on small delays because this allows us to capture better the impact of individual rearrangement events , since at larger @xmath67 several events may occur in between two images .",
    "the signal shown here have been calculated for an individual roi , but are representative of the general behavior of all rois . for the humid sample , @xmath23 exhibits",
    "modest fluctuations symmetrically distributed around its mean value ( panel a ) . moreover ,",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath23 , shown in panel b , is close to gaussian .",
    "we have shown in previous work  @xcite that this is typical of a signal dominated by the measurement noise , which is particularly high when the degree of correlation is calculated over the limited number of pixels of a small portion of the image , as required by a space - resolved analysis .",
    "panels c and d show @xmath23 and its pdf , respectively , for the dry sample .",
    "in contrast to the humid film , sudden drops of the degree of correlation can be easily observed , corresponding to sudden rearrangement events in the sample . as a result",
    "the pdf of the degree of correlation is skewed , with a tail associated with the intermittent drops of @xmath23 .",
    "in other systems , the shape of the pdf has been shown to be well fitted by a gumbel distribution  @xcite , often observed in the statistics of rare events in systems with extended spatial and temporal correlations  @xcite . here , the dynamics were too slow to allow us to accumulate enough statistics to make any quantitative statement on the shape of the pdf .",
    "we note however that the analysis of the temporal evolution of @xmath23 and its pdf confirms the differences between the two samples discussed in relation to fig .",
    "[ fig : asg2 ] : the dynamics of the dry sample are much more heterogeneous than those of the humid one .",
    "since the dynamics measured on the full field of view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asg2 ] ) exhibit significant fluctuations , we expect them to be spatially correlated over macroscopic distances .",
    "the spatial correlation of the dynamics calculated according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g4tilde ] ) and ( [ eq : g4 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asg4 ] , for the two samples , and for the three time lags indicated by open stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : asg2 ] . quite generally , @xmath2 is significantly larger than zero up to distances of the order of 1 mm ( for the humid sample ) or even several mm ( for the dry sample ) .",
    "this is remarkable , since all relevant structural length scales are much smaller .",
    "furthermore , the range of the spatial correlations of the dynamics is much longer for the dry sample than for the humid one ; together with the enhanced intermittency under dry conditions seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : asci ] , this explains why the dynamical susceptibility of the dry sample is higher than that of the wet one , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : asg2 ] .",
    "interestingly , the time lag dependence of @xmath2 is different for the two values of rh . at high rh ,",
    "the range of @xmath2 is maximum at intermediate time delays and decreases at small and large @xmath67 .",
    "this is similar to what reported in numerical work on supercooled molecular glass formers  @xcite and experiments on grains  @xcite , suggesting that dynamical heterogeneity progressively build up with time , starting from individual events that are relatively limited in size .",
    "eventually , at very large time lags , one expects @xmath2 to decay on short length scales , since many uncorrelated events will have occurred everywhere in the sample . the shorter range of @xmath2 at @xmath71 sec observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : asg4]a probably corresponds to the onset of this large @xmath67 regime . for the dry sample in panel b , @xmath2 is highly correlated over a very long range for essentially all probed lags , indicating that individual events extend over several millimeters .",
    "we do nt have currently an explanation for the somehow faster decay of @xmath2 at intermediate lags ; the long range of @xmath2 at the largest probed lag ( @xmath71 sec ) indicates that on this time scale the regime where many uncorrelated events have occurred throughout the sample is not yet attained .",
    "longer lags could not be reliably analyzed due to the limited duration of the experiment .",
    "summarizing , the dynamics of the `` artificial skin '' are markedly heterogeneous under dry conditions , associated with intermittent rearrangement events .",
    "these events imply the motion of the scatterers over just a few nanometers ( we recall that the full decay of @xmath12 corresponds to displacements of the order of 30 nm ) ; however , whenever they occur , they impact essentially the whole sample , since the spatial correlation of the dynamics extends over several mm . for the humid sample ,",
    "dynamical heterogeneities are less pronounced ; the range of spatial correlations , although reduced in comparison to that of the dry sample , is still on the order of 1 - 2 mm , much larger than any structural length scale in the sample .",
    "the change in dynamical behavior under different rh conditions observed here for the `` artificial skin '' is related to the loss of rigidity upon hydration and is reminiscent of the sensitivity to humidity of biological tissues .",
    "indeed , humidity plays a key role in controlling biomechanical properties of stratum corneum  @xcite , whose elastic modulus , e.g. , increases by several orders of magnitude with decreasing rh  @xcite",
    ".    one may wonder whether similar dynamical features are observed also in other glassy or jammed soft matter systems that , similarly to the `` artificial skin '' , are characterized by ultraslow dynamics and a viscoelastic behavior where the solid - like response dominates . to address this question , we plot in fig .",

    "we calculate the spatial correlation of the dynamics at a time lag @xmath67 much shorter than the relaxation time of the corresponding @xmath12 , in order to capture as much as possible the characteristics of single events . quite generally ,",
    "very long range correlations of the dynamics are observed for all samples , up to several mm , once again much larger than any structural length scale and comparable to the system size . in particular , data for the onions ,",
    "albeit somehow noisy due to the relatively small number of available pixels and the limited duration of the experiment ( about twice the relaxation time of @xmath12 ) , confirm and extend the long - range correlation of the dynamics observed , for a smaller field of view , by microscopy  @xcite . even for the `` artificial skin '' under humid conditions and the less compressed soft sphere system ( @xmath74c ) , where @xmath2 decreases more rapidly than for the other systems , spatial correlations still extend over macroscopic length scales .",
    "the only exceptions are the hard spheres samples . for these systems",
    ", @xmath26 drops to zero as soon as @xmath75 ; although we show here data at @xmath67 much smaller than the relaxation time of @xmath12 , we point out that a similar behavior is found at all @xmath67 . since the normalization method described in sec .  [",
    "sec : pci ] can not be applied , we represent @xmath26 rather than @xmath2 as for the other samples . for the less concentrated hard sphere suspension ,",
    "such a sharp drop of @xmath26 is not surprising , since no spatial correlation of the dynamics are to be expected at the onset of the supercooled regime .",
    "indeed , at @xmath76 the dynamics is slower than in the @xmath77 limit by a relatively modest factor of 100 , and the shape of the dynamic structure factor differs only marginally from that in the diluted case  @xcite . for the most concentrated hard sphere sample , by contrast ,",
    "the system relaxation is already slowed down by a factor of about @xmath78 compared to the @xmath79 limit and a fully developed plateau is observed in the dynamic structure factor , revealing caging and glassy dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that such a dramatic slow down of the dynamics is associated with the growth of spatial correlations of the dynamics .",
    "previous experiments , both by confocal microscopy  @xcite and dynamic light scattering  @xcite , indicate that the range , @xmath0 , of such correlations does not exceed a few particles sizes , i.e. a few @xmath80 m in our case .",
    "therefore , the absence of any measurable correlation in our pci experiment , where the smallest accessible spatial lag is @xmath81 , is fully consistent with previous results . on the one hand",
    ", this negative result illustrates the limitations intrinsic to pci , a coarse grained method . on the other hand",
    ", it highlights the dramatic difference between the dynamics of supercooled , stationary hard spheres and those of the other jammed , out - of - equilibrium samples , for which macroscopic spatial correlations of the dynamics are observed .",
    "the results shown here suggest that system - size correlations of the dynamics are ubiquitous in fully jammed systems , where the solid - like behavior of the sample dominates over its viscous response .",
    "indeed , in a material that is essentially solid - like , any deformation due to a local rearrangement will propagate very far before being substantially damped , leading to extended spatial correlations of the dynamics .",
    "another ( less attractive ) explanation of the dynamical fluctuations reported here could be that they are due to some kind of artifact .",
    "in fact , one should be aware that measuring fluctuations in a reliable fashion is much more difficult than just probing the average dynamics , and many spurious effects have to be controlled and ruled out ( for a discussion of some possible sources of artifacts , such as temperature fluctuations and laser beam pointing instabilities , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to address the role of the elastic propagation of a strain field and to demonstrate the genuine nature of the spatial correlations observed here , we discuss briefly an experiment performed on a laponite sample using a specially devised cell .",
    "the cell is a cylindrical tube of inner diameter @xmath82 mm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : laponite ] ) , with a microscope glass slide glued in the interior with epoxy , so as to separate the cell into two chambers .",
    "because the glass slide is cut unevenly and does not fit perfectly the cell walls , the two chambers are in contact through openings of size @xmath83 mm , so that the sample contained in the two chambers is fully equilibrated and experiences exactly the same conditions .",
    "the laser beam impinges perpendicularly to the glass slide , thereby illuminating both chambers , and the scattering volume is imaged at an angle @xmath84 , as in the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]a .",
    "we calculate the local @xmath23 for larger - than - usual rois , in order to reduce the noise contribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : laponite ] ) . from the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : laponite ] , it is clear that the time evolution of the degree of correlation measured on the same side of the glass slide is highly correlated ( rois 1 and 2 , separated by @xmath85 mm ) , since most of the downward spikes corresponding to sudden rearrangement events are co - occurrent .",
    "indeed , @xmath26 calculated from the signals for rois 1 and 2 is as high as 0.394 ( we recall that @xmath26 is affected by the noise contribution , so that an even higher value would be observed in the absence of noise ) .",
    "by contrast , the events recorded in roi 3 , on the opposite side of the glass slide , appear to be uncorrelated with respect of those of rois 1 and 2 , as confirmed by low values of the correlation ( e.g. , @xmath26 = -0.015 when correlating the signals from rois 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that the downward spikes observed in @xmath23 can not be due to some mechanical , temperature or laser beam instability , since they occur independently on either side of the glass slide . on the other hand , the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : laponite ] support the idea that the propagation of a strain field in a predominantly elastic medium is responsible for long range spatial correlations .",
    "indeed , such a strain field can not propagate through the rigid glass slide , so that the dynamical activity in the two chambers is uncorrelated , while the one in a given chamber is correlated .",

    "similar results are obtained for the laponite suspension  @xcite and for the colloidal gels  @xcite . note that the magnitude of the elastic modulus of the colloidal gel ( @xmath93  @xcite ) is lower than that of the onion gel and of the laponite suspension by at least 5 orders of magnitude , implying that the absolute value of @xmath94 is not a relevant parameter in determining the range of spatial correlations of the dynamics . a systematic investigation of the shear moduli of the soft particles is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the most concentrated sample reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : g4all ] above , one finds that @xmath94 and @xmath91 are nearly frequency independent and that the former is larger than the latter by almost a decade .",
    "by contrast , for the less concentrated sample both moduli are comparable ( see panels a ) and b ) of fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , revealing a complex viscoelastic behavior where neither the solid - like nor the fluid - like character prevail . since spatial correlations of the dynamics",
    "are shorter - ranged in the less concentrated sample , these observations are consistent with the notion that a fully developed elastic behavior is a necessary condition for long - range spatial correlations of the dynamics .",
    "the same trend is likely to hold for the `` artificial skin '' .",
    "indeed , we find that the range of the spatial correlation of the dynamics increases as the rh decreases .",
    "although no rheology data are available for the `` artificial skin '' , it is worth noting that in stratum corneum  @xcite , a material whose properties the vitro - corneum@xmath35 film is designed to mimic , the elastic modulus grows by almost 3 orders of magnitude when the rh decreases from 100% to 30% .",
    "collectively , these results indicate that systems with long - ranged spatial correlations of the dynamics have a solid - like behavior . a close inspection of rheology data for hard sphere suspensions , for which we recall that @xmath0 is limited to a few particle sizes at most ,",
    "show that the reverse is not true .",
    "mason and weitz have measured the shear moduli of supercooled hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "care must be taken in applying their results to our hard sphere samples , due to the unavoidable uncertainties in the determination of the absolute volume fraction  @xcite .",
    "a generally accepted approach consists in considering the separation , @xmath95 , with respect to the location @xmath96 of the ( apparent ) divergence of the relaxation time as obtained from a mode coupling theory fit of @xmath97 [ in our work , @xmath98  @xcite , while @xmath99 in ref .",
    "@xcite ] . for our most diluted sample , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , corresponding roughly to the data for @xmath102 in ref .",
    "@xcite . at that volume fraction ,",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath91 have approximately equal magnitude in all the accessible frequency range , similarly to the case of our soft spheres at @xmath103",
    ". however , no spatial correlation of the dynamics is observed in the hard spheres at @xmath76 , while @xmath104 mm for the soft spheres at @xmath103 .",
    "this difference is even more striking if we consider our most concentrated hard sphere sample , for which @xmath0 is limited to a few particle sizes  @xcite , although the sample is solid - like ( @xmath94 dominates over @xmath91 ) and the magnitude of its elastic modulus  @xcite is comparable to that of the laponite suspension , which exhibits systems - size dynamical correlations .",
    "our measurements thus indicate that , while elasticity is a necessary condition for observing extended spatial correlations of the dynamics , it is not a sufficient one .",
    "the microscopic origin of the elasticity must also play a crucial role : the differences discussed above suggest that @xmath0 is modest in systems where the elasticity has an entropic origin , as for the hard spheres , and no long - lived network of contacts exists .",
    "by contrast , @xmath0 is very large in systems where elasticity has an enthalpic origin , be it due to the bending rigidity of the protein filament network in `` artificial skin '' and the backbone in diluted gels made of strongly attractive particles , or to the bulk elasticity of squeezed particles , as in the soft spheres and the onions .",
    "note that the laponite suspension falls also in the latter category : while the platelets are not in direct contact , they interact via a screened coulombic repulsive potential and can thus be effectively regarded as squeezed soft particles .",
    "interestingly , recent work  @xcite has identified a structural length scale that controls the mechanical properties of attractive colloidal systems : this length scale is of the order of the particle size for hard spheres , while it grows as short - ranged attractive interactions become increasingly important , as in colloidal gels .",
    "our data suggest that this behavior may be mirrored by a similar growth of @xmath0 . in repulsive , squeezed systems , the same role is presumably played by a persistent network of interparticle forces , such as that visualized by confocal microscopy in compressed emulsions  @xcite .    in view of the above discussion",
    ", it is natural to compare our results to numerical and experimental work on driven jammed systems . in these works ,",
    "the sample is sheared by imposing either a continuous deformation or a sinusoidal one .",
    "the dynamics are quantified by the particle displacements perpendicular to the shear direction or after subtracting the affine component ( for a continuous shear ) , or by comparing successive configurations at zero deformation ( for oscillatory shear ) . for a 2d granular medium sheared at a finite shear rate , lechenault _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite find that a spatial correlation function analogous to our @xmath2 decays on a length scale @xmath105 on the order of ten particle sizes at the jamming transition , and that this length decreases upon further compression , although only a restrained range of densities above jamming could be probed , due to the particle stiffness .",
    "simulations of sheared soft disks  @xcite indicate that above the jamming transition and at finite shear stress , @xmath106 , @xmath0 remains moderate , but a scaling analysis suggests that @xmath0 diverges in the limit @xmath107 for all densities above jamming .",
    "this is confirmed by quasi - static shear simulations of jammed soft particles  @xcite , where it is shown that spatial correlations of the dynamics above jamming are limited only by the system size .",
    "therefore , the dynamical behavior reported here appears to be due to the connected nature of the materials investigated , where a strain field can propagate over very large distances , as in fully jammed systems sheared at a vanishingly small rate . a related issue , still open , concerns the microscopic origin of the dynamics .",
    "the systems studied in refs .  @xcite are athermal , with no dynamics in the absence of an external driving .",
    "although the systems presented here are thermal and no external drive is applied to them , it is unlikely that thermal motion alone is responsible for their dynamics in the jammed state .",
    "this is illustrated , e.g. , by the volume fraction dependence of the dynamics reported for the soft spheres of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the supercooled regime , the relaxation time , @xmath108 , grows sharply with @xmath109 , as in hard sphere systems . above random close packing , a different regime sets in , where @xmath108 grows very slowly with @xmath109 .",
    "thus , above jamming , the relaxation time is orders of magnitude smaller than what expected by extrapolating the behavior in the supercooled regime , strongly suggesting that an additional relaxation mechanism has set in .",
    "we propose that , quite generally , the relaxation of internal stress may be such a mechanism in jammed soft matter .",
    "this is an appealing explanation , since it would be consistent with the observed ultra - long range correlations of the dynamics .",
    "however , this conjecture still awaits for a direct experimental proof .",
    "we have presented direct measurements of the correlation length of the slow dynamics of a variety of glassy and jammed soft systems , obtained using the recently introduced pci method .",
    "this technique allows one to measure coarse grained maps of the dynamical activity of a sample .",
    "its main advantage consists in the possibility of probing motion on a very small length scale , yet for a very large field of view .",
    "this is an attractive feature for jammed systems , where motion is very restrained but highly correlated spatially .",
    "additionally , the technique does not require individual particles to be imaged ; accordingly , it can be applied to systems for which direct visualization by optical or confocal microscopy is not possible , including turbid samples as , e.g. , foams  @xcite .",
    "we find that in deeply jammed systems @xmath0 is quite generally very large , typically on the order of the system size .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the modest correlation lengths measured in glass formers , including colloidal hard spheres .",
    "an analysis of the viscoelastic properties of the various systems investigated here shows that a well developed elasticity ( @xmath110 ) always accompanies the presence of long - ranged spatial correlations of the dynamics , regardless of the absolute magnitude of the elastic modulus .",
    "the reverse , however , is not true , as exemplified by concentrated hard sphere suspensions , whose macroscopic rheological response is predominantly solid - like , whereas the correlation length of the dynamics is limited to a few particle sizes .",
    "these results highlight the crucial role of the microscopic origin of elasticity ( entropic vs. enthalpic ) in determining the range of spatial correlations of the dynamics .",
    "further work will be needed to test thoroughly these ideas , for example by varying continuously the strength of attractions in dense colloidal suspensions , so as to change progressively the nature of the elasticity  @xcite and , presumably , the correlation length @xmath0 .",
