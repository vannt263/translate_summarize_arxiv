    "it is well known that the solar and atmospheric data are consistent with so - called tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing @xcite , @xmath4 the ansatz of tb lepton mixing matrix is interesting due to its symmetry properties which seem to call for a possibly discrete non - abelian family symmetry in nature @xcite .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of theoretical work in which the observed tb neutrino flavour symmetry may be related to some family symmetry @xcite .",
    "these models may be classified according to the way that tb mixing is achieved , namely either directly or indirectly @xcite .",
    "the direct models are based on @xmath1 or @xmath5 , or a larger group that contains these groups as a subgroup , and in these models some of the generators of the family symmetry survive to form at least part of the neutrino flavour symmetry . in the indirect models ,",
    "typically based on @xmath6 or @xmath7 , none of the generators of the family symmetry appear in the neutrino flavour symmetry @xcite .",
    "all of the above models rely on some kind of vacuum alignment mechanism , which in 4d susy models may arise from either f - terms in direct models or d - terms in indirect models ( for a recent discussion see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most ambitious models combine family symmetry with grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the minimal family symmetry which contains triplet representations and can lead to tb mixing via the direct model approach is @xmath1 .",
    "the minimal simple gut group is @xmath8 .",
    "a direct model has been proposed which combines @xmath1 family symmetry with @xmath8 supersymmetric ( susy ) guts @xcite .",
    "this model was formulated in five dimensions ( 5d ) , in part to address the doublet - triplet splitting problem of guts @xcite , and in part to allow a viable description of the charged fermion mass hierarchies , by placing the lightest two ten - plets @xmath9 , @xmath10 in the bulk , while the pentaplets @xmath11 and @xmath12 are on the brane .",
    "it was subsequently shown how the geometry of 6d compactification may be used to generate the @xmath1 symmetry dynamically @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and subsequently an @xmath8 susy gut model in 6d was proposed in which the @xmath1 symmetry arises dynamically @xcite . however , in both the 5d model @xcite and the 6d model @xcite , the @xmath1 was broken at the effective 4d level in the standard way using f - terms to align the two flavons @xmath13 , @xmath14 via the introduction of so - called driving fields .    in the framework of extra dimensional theories ,",
    "an attractive alternative mechanism for vacuum alignment arises based on orbifolding @xcite .",
    "the required alignment at the zero mode level is achieved by imposing non - trivial boundary conditions on the orbifold @xcite . in order to achieve the desired vacuum alignment for the two flavons @xmath13 , @xmath14 in an @xmath1 model it was demonstrated that it is necessary to formulate the model in 8 dimensions , which allows 4 compact dimensions which may be regarded as two complex compact dimensions @xmath15 , where each is subject to a particular 2d orbifold which gives the vacuum alignment for the particular flavon @xmath13 , @xmath14 living in those dimensions @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been applied to @xmath5 where it has been shown that some of the desired alignments may be achieved in 6d @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath1 it is clear that it is necessary to formulate the model in 8d in order to achieve successful vacuum alignments via boundary conditions , although so far only an illustrative model along these lines has been presented @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to formulate the first realistic @xmath0 susy gut model with @xmath1 family symmetry in 8d where the vacuum alignment is straightforwardly achieved by the use of boundary conditions on orbifolds of the four compact dimensions .",
    "we emphasise that we are motivated to consider an 8d theory by the desire to achieve vacuum alignment in an elegant way using orbifold boundary conditions .",
    "it is not possible to implement this idea with lower dimensional models such as the the 5d model in @xcite or the 6d model in @xcite since the desired alignment mechanism is not possible under a single orbifolding due to the requirement that the two triplet flavons @xmath13 and @xmath14 have different boundary conditions in order to have the different alignments at the zero mode level .",
    "working in 8d also brings additional benefits , for example the inter - family mass hierarchies will arise in part due to suppression factors arising from an asymmetric geometric dilution of the wavefunctions in the four compact dimensions , although a @xmath16 froggatt - nielsen family symmetry will also be required . in the 8d model",
    "the 4 extra dimensions are compactified onto 2 complex directions which are each orbifolded with @xmath17 and @xmath18 symmetries .",
    "these orbifoldings are also used to specify non - trivial boundary conditions on the various multiplets which break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry and the extended @xmath19 symmetry to leave an effective @xmath20 standard model theory in 4 dimensions .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the orbifoldings the first two families of @xmath2-plets are duplicated introducing new gut scale mass particles to the theory , although such a feature removes any desirable gut predictions it also removes some unwanted gut mass relations .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model and show how the 8 dimensions are compactified upon two @xmath21 orbifolds leading to gauge and susy breaking as above .",
    "we specify the superfield content and symmetries of the model .",
    "we describe the transformation of the fields under these orbifoldings which leads to an effective 4d standard model theory from the 8d @xmath0 theory .",
    "we first show how the gut group is broken and how this naturally leads to doublet - triplet splitting of the higgs multiplets .",
    "we then discuss vacuum alignment in the 8d theory , and show how boundary conditions can lead to the desired alignment directions .",
    "we also discuss the values of the higgs and flavon vevs , including the effects of bulk suppression factors . in section [ sec : superpotentials ] we write down the effective 4d superpotential and the resulting mass matrices .",
    "we also analyse contributions from terms beyond the leading order to the mass matrices .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we are considering a model in 8 dimensions with the extra dimensions compactified on two 2d orbifolds as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbifold ] .",
    "the @xmath0 gauge group lives in the full 8d bulk , with the 8d space compactified to 4d minkowski space @xmath22 4d compact dimensions with the two complex compact dimensions described by the coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we suppose that the 8d space is compactified by orbifolding . in the @xmath23 direction",
    "the @xmath17 orbifolding breaks the gauge symmetry and gives the alignment of the @xmath1 flavon @xmath14 , while the @xmath18 orbifold breaks the extended supersymmetry as described below . in the @xmath24 direction",
    "the @xmath17 orbifolding also breaks the gauge symmetry to the standard model in exactly the same way as in the @xmath23 direction , while the @xmath18 symmetry is used to give the alignment of the @xmath1 flavon @xmath13 as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : alignment ] and @xcite .",
    "we suppose that some of the matter and higgs fields do not feel the full 8d but are restricted to live in a 6d subspace of the full 8d theory .",
    "the second family of @xmath2 s , @xmath10 , live in the @xmath23 direction along with both higgs multiplets , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the first family of @xmath2 s , @xmath9 , is placed in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "similarly , the flavons @xmath14 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 live in the @xmath23 direction , with @xmath13 and @xmath29 in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "we confine the other matter fields to live in a 4d subspace , with the three families of @xmath30 matter , @xmath11 , and the third family of @xmath2 s , @xmath12 , along with the three families of right - handed neutrinos , @xmath31 , located at the 4 dimensional fixed point @xmath32 , with the yukawa couplings given by the overlap of the wavefunctions at this fixed point .",
    "the particle content of the model is summarised in table [ table : particles ] .    a schematic diagram of the model is shown in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "as both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions have a @xmath17 orbifolding breaking the gauge symmetry , doublet - triplet splitting of the higgs multiplets occurs .",
    "however this results in half the @xmath2-plet becoming heavy . to overcome this , an extra copy of @xmath2 s",
    "must be included in both directions with opposite parity under the @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "this results in the complete matter content and also allows us to escape unwanted gut mass relations .",
    "in addition to the unwanted gut mass relations the doubling of the first two families also prevents good gut predictions such as the gatto - sartori - tonin and georgi - jarlskog relations .",
    "the 8 dimensional theory has an @xmath1 family symmetry which is broken by three flavons @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "the vacuum alignment of the flavons is achieved by imposing non - trivial boundary conditions on the flavons so that only the required alignment has a zero - mode .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 flavour symmetry there is volume suppression for superpotential terms involving 6d fields .",
    "this suppression , however , turns out to be insufficient to account for realistic masses and mixings . to obtain a realistic pattern we also exploit the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite with a @xmath16 symmetry and the two froggatt - nielsen flavons @xmath29 and @xmath28 living in the different orbifolded directions .",
    "we also make use of @xmath34 and @xmath18 symmetries as shown in table [ table : particles ] .      the orbifolding can be used to break both the gauge symmetry and susy @xcite .",
    "models have also been proposed @xcite that combine these two ideas to give an extra dimensional gut theory with a family symmetry arising from the compactification of the extra dimensions . in the present model",
    "we will not insist that the family symmetry is dynamically generated from the compactified geometry of extra dimensions , but merely suppose that it pre - exists in the 8d theory .",
    "however the part of the orbifold @xmath35 described in this section is the same as that described in @xcite where the @xmath1 is dynamically generated .",
    "the new feature here is that we shall use orbifold boundary conditions to give the desired vacuum alignment for the flavons which break @xmath1 , thereby yielding tb neutrino mixing .",
    "we complexify the extra dimensions @xmath36 so that they are described by one complex coordinate @xmath37 .",
    "the extra dimensions are compactified on the a twisted torus defined by identifying the following translations : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and we have set @xmath40 , the length of the extra dimension , to unity .",
    "we then impose the following identification : @xmath41 this defines the orbifold @xmath35 as in @xcite .",
    "we can also impose a @xmath18 symmetry in order to define the orbifold @xmath21 , we impose the following identification : @xmath42 combining eqns .",
    "( [ eqn : torus1])-([eqn : z3 ] ) gives the definition of the orbifold @xmath21 which is the complex direction denoted by @xmath23 in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "we follow an analogous procedure for the remaining 2 extra dimensions by defining @xmath43 and imposing the above definitions substituting @xmath24 for @xmath23 . in other words ,",
    "we apply @xmath21 orbifolding separately in each of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 spaces .",
    "the overall orbifold has a single fixed point invariant under both the @xmath17 and @xmath18 transformations which is located at @xmath44 .",
    "it is at this 4d point that the yukawa interactions occur .",
    "the full 8d theory is @xmath20 @xmath0 and the 8d bulk of the theory contains the @xmath0 gauge bosons . because spinors in 8 dimensions contain a minimum of 16 real components then in 4 dimensions the effective theory must have @xmath19 supersymmetry @xcite . in order to eliminate this extended supersymmetry",
    "we can impose boundary conditions on the multiplets so that they become heavy and play no part in the zero mode physics .",
    "the @xmath19 vector multiplet decomposes into 3 chiral @xmath45 and one vector @xmath46 @xmath20 multiplets .",
    "we can use the @xmath47 part of the orbifolding to eliminate the unwanted multiplets by imposing the boundary conditions : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the cube roots of unity , leaving @xmath50 at the fixed point at @xmath44 .",
    "we are therefore left with an effective @xmath20 theory in 4 dimensions .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath8 gauge group down to that of the standard model can be achieved by the @xmath17 part of the orbifolding . by using a single parity @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 we shall require that : @xmath53 gauge boson fields of the standard model thus have positive parity and fields belonging to @xmath54 have negative parity .",
    "only fields with a positive parity have zero modes and therefore gauge bosons not belonging to the standard model gauge group become heavy and the gauge symmetry is broken . in our model both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions are orbifolded in this way , this allows us to relax unwanted gut relations between the down quark and charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "so far we have just considered the gauge sector of @xmath8 . adding the higgs to the 6d theory is straightforward . in the @xmath8 gut theory these are contained in the @xmath55-plet and @xmath56-plet of higgs fields . for the gauge breaking orbifold",
    "we choose : @xmath57 it is easy to see with the form of @xmath51 that the last three entries gain a minus sign which makes them heavy whereas the first two entries are left unchanged leaving them light , resulting in a light doublet and a heavy coloured triplet . similarly with the @xmath2-plets living in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions half",
    "the multiplet becomes heavy , however by introducing extra multiplets with opposite parity the full particle content is restored at zero mode .",
    "this feature also allows us to evade unwanted gut relations .",
    "[ sec : vev ] in order to break the @xmath1 family symmetry we will impose non - trivial boundary conditions on flavons under the orbifoldings so that only a particular alignment survives to low energy . by imposing boundary conditions we are able to avoid introducing the driving fields and avoid having to write down a possibly complicated flavon potential .",
    "we will now describe the procedure for obtaining the alignment , closely following the procedure developed in @xcite to which we refer the reader for more details . the first @xmath17 boundary condition",
    ", @xmath58 requires the matrix @xmath59 to be of order 2 .",

    "we can choose the matrix @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 in the basis of @xmath1 where s is diagonal .",
    "this makes it trivial to see which alignment is left as a zero mode .",
    "this choice leaves a single zero mode in the @xmath63 direction in this basis . to find what this alignment is in the t diagonal basis it is a simple matter to rotate the vector using ( for example see @xcite ) : @xmath64 this leaves us with the alignment @xmath65 in the t diagonal basis . for the @xmath18 orbifolding we can impose the boundary condition @xmath66 and we can choose @xmath1 elements which have order 3 .",
    "for @xmath67 we choose @xmath68 where @xmath69 this gives a single zero mode @xmath70 .",
    "turning to the vevs themselves , for simplicity from now on we shall set the radii of the compact directions to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which implies that the higgs vevs are given by    @xmath73    where we have included the effect of arbitrary twist angle @xmath29 on the torus @xcite .",
    "for numerical estimates we will set the twist angle to @xmath74 ( by choosing @xmath39 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : torus2 ] ) as in @xcite ( although in the present model this is an arbitrary choice ) .",
    "a useful feature of this setup is the suppression of the yukawa couplings of fields living in the bulk .",
    "a field living in the 6d bulk of one of the orbifolded directions is related to it s zero mode by @xmath75 where the dots represent the higher , heavy modes and v is the volume of the extra dimensional space .",
    "the above expansion produces a factor @xmath76 : @xmath77 this feature will produce suppression for couplings involving these bulk fields .",
    "since we are considering 6 dimensional fields that live in either the @xmath23 or @xmath24 direction we will have two not necessarily equal volume factors , @xmath78 and @xmath79 :    @xmath80    and @xmath81    including volume suppression factors , we summarise the aligned flavon vevs as follows ,    @xmath82    we have defined the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 so that they are dimensionless recalling that 6d fields have mass dimension two .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen flavons @xmath85 require no special vacuum alignment and are assumed to obtain vevs @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "such vevs can be obtained as in @xcite by minimising the d - term scalar potential .",

    "the @xmath91 part concerns the flavon fields , however since the @xmath1 flavon alignment is given by the non - trivial boundary conditions imposed by the orbifolding we can avoid writing down explicitly the ( possibly complicated ) flavon potential .",
    "however without explicitly writing the flavon potential we do lose the ability to make specific claims on relations between the @xmath1 flavon vevs .",

    "such corrections come from the heavier modes which have a higher mass through orbifolding and will alter the alignment of @xmath13 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : alignment ] .",
    "we set @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 , we choose for simplicity @xmath110 .",
    "we should make clear that taking @xmath110 means that we are not using the froggatt - nielsen mechanism to provide the suppression .",
    "insted the hierarchies originate from the bulk suppression factors @xmath111 .",

    "these mass matrices give us approximate quark masses and mixing angles of the correct order of magnitude .",
    "for example the quark mixing angles are given roughly by , @xmath116    so far we have not specified the size of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , however from the ratio of the top and bottom quark masses we expect @xmath119 where @xmath120 .      in the neutrino sector",

    "after these flavons develop a vev the gauge singlets @xmath31 become heavy and the seesaw mechanism takes place similar to @xcite,@xcite with the alteration that a zero vev @xmath1 singlet flavon is no longer required as the vacuum alignment is determined by boundary conditions rather than by the use of driving fields .",
