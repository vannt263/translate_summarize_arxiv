    "the discovery by @xcite of the @xmath0 spin - orbit resonance of mercury ignited interest in rotational - orbital dynamics .",
    "mercury remained until recently the only solar - system body in an asynchronous spin - orbit resonance .",
    "@xcite proffered an explanation for mercury s unusual fate ; this work was soon followed by the seminal papers of @xcite and much later those of @xcite , all of whom undertook a detailed study of spin - orbit dynamics .",
    "renewed attention was afforded to the subject with the article by @xcite on the nature of hyperion s rotation .",
    "these authors asserted that the irregularly shaped satellite tumbles chaotically as it revolves around saturn .",
    "unambiguously confirmed shortly thereafter by ground - based observations @xcite , hyperion s chaotic state is often invoked to illustrate a prime example of chaotic dynamics in action .",
    "many other satellites have seen episodes of chaotic rotation in their past .",
    "@xcite showed that any object that occupies the @xmath1 state must have crossed a chaotic zone at some point in its history .",
    "if the zone is attitude - stable as is generally the case for uniformly shaped bodies , trapping is temporary and the body escapes to a regular spin state .",
    "otherwise the fate is inevitably one of long - term non - principal axis rotation .",
    "in addition to the primary resonances , the phase space of a nonlinear dynamical system may contain secondary , or even more complicated resonances .",
    "motivated by the tidal heating conundrum concerning enceladus , @xcite developed a theoretical foundation of secondary configurations .",
    "he proposed that capture into the @xmath2 secondary resonance could provide a plausible mechanism for the resurfacing activity on enceladus and its apparent role as a source of e - ring material .",
    "further , as the name suggests , instances of spin - orbit coupling may have significant effects on the orbital motion of the bodies concerned .",
    "@xcite was among those who  recognizing the mathematical parallels between mean motion and spin - orbit commensurabilities  proposed that a unified theory be developed to encompass both forms of interaction . like their mean motion counterparts , spin - orbit resonances result in a stabilizing effect on the motion of objects bound in their domain",
    "moreover , examination of the whole resonant structure provides insight into the past evolution of the system .",
    "additionally , the nature of the coupling can shed light on the future dynamics . @xcite",
    "address this oft forgotten issue showing that in the case of an ellipsoidal satellite orbiting its parent planet at a distance of approximately 10 times the satellite s mean radius , such resonances can lead to chaotic orbital motion .",
    "though we possess a good understanding of capture into orbital resonances , the mechanics behind capture into a spin - orbit resonance remains relatively unknown .",
    "write that `` no mathematical proofs are nowadays available on the effective mechanism of capture into a resonance , but it is widely accepted that one can not explain the actual state of the satellites without invoking dissipative torques . ''",
    "thus while the inconclusiveness of current methods is freely acknowledged , most authors tend to favor those approaches adopted by both darwin and macdonald as described in @xcite .",
    "indeed , no alternative mechanism had been proposed until recently , when the work of @xcite unraveled the outstanding question concerning mercury s capture into the @xmath0 state .",
    "@xcite argue that for any eccentricity , the spin rate of a body is naturally driven towards some equilibrium value which depends on its current eccentricity . since the eccentricity varies due to orbital perturbations , the spin rate can be naturally pumped both up and down . crossing a resonance",
    "has some probability of resulting in the capture of the object and preventing further evolution of the spin .",
    "an untrapped spin rate can cross a resonance repeatedly , thus increasing its probability of being trapped .",
    "however , a captured body can be released if the eccentricity falls low enough for that resonance to become unstable to tidal torque .",
    "the sort of complex interaction between orbit and spin seen in recent work make it interesting to study other resonances .",
    "in particular , @xcite point out that mercury s present equilibrium spin rate is close to the @xmath3 resonance , even though the actual spin rate is trapped in the @xmath0 state .",
    "but the @xmath3 is a second order resonance and does not appear in a simple first order treatment of spin - orbit dynamics , even though it is easy to find in numerical integrations .",
    "accordingly we are motivated in this paper to develop a perturbative treatment of the planar spin - orbit problem to second order .",
    "we use the now - standard technique of lie transforms . through lie",
    "transform perturbation theory we can derive an integral of motion for both non - resonant and resonant orbits , and use this integral to generate composite surfaces of section .",
    "these we can easily compare with numerical surfaces of section . the algebraic details quickly become messy , especially at second order , and we will not show them in full in this paper . instead , we will illustrate the procedure in detail for a driven double pendulum , which is closely analogous to a spin - orbit system but much simpler .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ theoryforspin - orbitcoupling ] we present the hamiltonian formulation of the spin - orbit problem .",
    "also given is the hamiltonian of the driven pendulum whose dynamics provide an analog with the spin - orbit coupling . sect .",
    "[ perturbationtheory ] sees development of the perturbative approach through lie transforms , including application to resonances of first and second order . in sect .",
    "[ results ] we investigate how our perturbative model fares in relation to numerical integrations for selected solar system bodies . sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] comprises a brief summary of the paper .",
    "the spin - orbit problem is discussed in modern texts such as @xcite or @xcite , so here we only cover the essentials briefly . in the planar problem ,",
    "pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the angle @xmath4 is the true anomaly while @xmath5 is the angle between the satellite - planet line and central axis of the satellite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 .",
    "neglecting tidal torques , the resulting equation of motion for @xmath7 is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the satellite s semi - major axis , @xmath10 measures the satellite s radial distance to the planet , and @xmath11 is the mean motion ( i.e. angular orbital frequency ) .",
    "the asphericity parameter @xmath12 is defined in terms of the moments of inertia @xmath13 by @xmath14 the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ fullpendulum_eq ] ) is explicitly integrable in two cases : ( i )  when the satellite is oblate i.e. @xmath15 , there is zero torque indicating a freely rotating body , or ( ii )  when the orbit is circular , which corresponds to a pendulum equation .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ fullpendulum_eq ] ) is equivalent to the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "units have been chosen such that @xmath20 and hence @xmath21 corresponds to an orbital period .",
    "the hamiltonian can be rendered autonomous by the standard device of extending the phase space .",
    "the equivalent autonomous hamiltonian is @xmath22 here @xmath23 ( and also equals the mean anomaly in celestial mechanics ) , while @xmath24 has a value such that @xmath25 .    the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ revisedhamiltonian ] ) )",
    "depends on @xmath26 through @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "for perturbation theory we wish to make the @xmath26-dependence explicit .",
    "there are classical techniques for doing so , but here we introduce a new way which is well - suited to computer algebra .",
    "consider the expansion @xmath27 which is a fourier series in @xmath26 with fourier coefficients @xmath28 let us recall the standard expressions for keplerian motion in terms of the auxiliary variable @xmath29 ( called the eccentric anomaly in celestial mechanics ) : @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ rtf ] ) we have @xmath31 , which lets us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fouriercoeff ] ) as @xmath32 thus making the integrand an explicit function of the integration variable .",
    "the integral ( eq .",
    "( [ hde ] ) ) may be solved as a power series in @xmath33 for any given @xmath34 ; the integration is somewhat tedious by hand , but trivial using computer algebra .",
    "the answer will always be real .",
    "now , multiplying the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) by @xmath35 and taking the real part gives @xmath36 the potential part of the hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ revisedhamiltonian ] ) ) is now expressed as a fourier series in @xmath37 with coefficients @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ hde ] ) .",
    "the @xmath38 themselves are power series in the eccentricity .",
    "they are credited in the literature to @xcite and we will refer to them as _",
    "cayley coefficients_. they are tabulated in table  1 of @xcite and table  2.1 of @xcite .",
    "thus the two degree of freedom autonomous hamiltonian is @xmath39 under this guise , the @xmath1 resonance with @xmath40 has the argument @xmath41 ; similarly , @xmath42 for the @xmath0 commensurability , and so the associated argument is @xmath43 .",
    "a body with low @xmath33 generally has as its final spin state the synchronous lock : this is dictated by the form of the cayley coefficient @xmath44 , which in the limit as @xmath45 , tends towards unity .",
    "moreover the leading term in the @xmath46series decays as @xmath47 .",
    "so for small values of the eccentricity , it is reasonable to focus on the dominant resonances , namely the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 , though several adjacent resonances must also be considered , not least to permit study of the effects caused by small divisors .",
    "for increasing eccentricity however , the presence of higher order @xmath33 terms in the expansion is crucial ",
    "these are now the prominent terms , substantially larger than their counterparts at lower order in @xmath33 . indeed",
    ", the higher the eccentricity , the longer it takes the series to converge .    to illustrate the preceding argument , in table  [ tbl1 ]",
    "we have tabulated the cayley coefficients for selected solar system bodies .",
    "we also include an example of a highly eccentric object .",
    "while mercury s eccentricity is usually considered to be rather sizable , as far as this analysis is concerned , it falls into the low @xmath33 category . on the other hand ,",
    "nereid s exceptionally high eccentricity of @xmath48 affords substantial significance to cayley coefficients at growing distance from the traditionally strongest coupling ; that is , the synchronous state .      our perturbative calculations with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ primaryh ] ) contain a minimum of four terms in the sum . at second order ,",
    "the resulting expressions span several pages . rather than mask the underlying simplicity of the perturbative scheme in such a mess ,",
    "we choose instead a simple example to illustrate the mechanics of perturbation theory in the form of lie transforms .",
    "the driven pendulum is a double pendulum ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  with inner pendulum driven at unit angular frequency .",
    "its hamiltonian is @xmath49 which is quite similar to the spin - orbit hamiltonian , with the angles @xmath50 and @xmath26 being analogous to the orientation angle and orbital phase ( mean anomaly ) respectively . for a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ drivenh ] ) see the appendix .",
    "a different driven pendulum , having one more driving term , is considered in @xcite .",
    "an important property of hamiltonian systems is the following : if @xmath51 depends on @xmath50 and @xmath26 only through the combination @xmath52 , then @xmath53 will be a constant of the motion .",
    "various forms of this statement appear in the literature  see for instance theorem  2 of @xcite , but here we provide a simple proof .    given any coprime integers @xmath54 , we can always find integers @xmath55 , such that the matrix @xmath56 has unit determinant .",
    "we can then define @xmath57 the integer matrix of eq .",
    "( [ relateq ] ) is the inverse transpose of that in eq .",
    "( [ relatep ] ) .",
    "this transformation is canonical ( see e.g. sect .  3 of @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath61 is the resonant ( and hence slowly varying ) angle and @xmath59 is fast by comparison . as @xmath62 form the conjugate pair to @xmath63",

    "following averaging over @xmath59 , the fast action @xmath65 is constant .",
    "let us illustrate the conservation of @xmath65 by considering the hamiltonian @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "this gives us @xmath68 making use of this equation and our earlier result that @xmath69 we have @xmath70 which is a pendulum equation .",
    "if we now introduce a resonant angle @xmath71 , we will recover the pendulum equation in eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "the well - known overlap criterion of @xcite corresponds to the overlap of oscillations of pendulum equations resulting from two or more resonance terms .",
    "this is considered a diagnostic for the onset of large - scale chaos .",
    "hamiltonian perturbation theory is based on transforming a hamiltonian @xmath72 into a so - called kamiltonian @xmath73 which is easier to solve .",

    "we find that the perturbative solution approximates well both the location and extent of the islands .",
    "the hamiltonian for the driven pendulum was defined in eq .",

    "in other words , we take any terms in @xmath106 that are either independent of @xmath107 or involve the resonant argument ( in this case @xmath108 ) and copy them into @xmath93 .",

    "its large asphericity @xmath185 together with eccentricity @xmath186 puts hyperion off the scale of fig .  4 but at a location that would correspond to a position deep in region e. as evident from e.g. fig .  1 of @xcite , the phase space is largely chaotic but has some small resonant islands .",
    "our second order perturbative model recovers the @xmath187 resonant islands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] but does not succeed for islands below @xmath188 .",
    "( in this example , we increased @xmath154 in eq .",
    "( [ primaryh ] ) from 4 to 6 , because of the comparatively large perturbation . )",
    "the saturnian satellite enceladus has a moderately high asphericity @xmath189 but very low eccentricity @xmath190 , thus putting it in region  a. it exhibits a secondary resonance , a phenomenon not allowed for in our perturbative model .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows our results for the @xmath1 resonance in enceladus . with relation to the secondary islands and their separatrix",
    ", we find that our perturbative model fails to resemble these lobes ; instead concentric rings intersect these areas . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite shows that the secondary resonances can be reproduced by an averaging model specifically designed for secondary resonances . to facilitate comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] has been chosen to have the same scales as wisdom s fig .",
    ".    we will now digress briefly to explain the difference between wisdom s approach and ours .",
    "let us return for a moment to the main hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ primaryh ] ) . considering only the synchronous resonance ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath191 recall that we have taken @xmath192 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath193 as the perturbing parameter .",
    "the action - angle variables of @xmath102 are simply are @xmath194 . on the other hand wisdom",
    "adopts @xmath195 as the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath33 as the perturbation .",
    "if this is done , the synchronous resonance appears already in the unperturbed dynamics , and then through perturbation theory the secondary resonances can be recovered .",
    "the complication is that the action - angle variables of @xmath196 are no longer @xmath194 but non - elementary functions of them ; moreover the perturbation must be expressed in terms of these new action - angles .",
    "fortunately in the case of enceladus , because of the small eccentricity , averaging is adequate and for averaging it is only necessary to extract one key term in the perturbation .",
    "developing first or second order lie transform perturbation theory for secondary resonances is in principle possible but is a much more difficult task because of the complicated nature of the action - angle variables required .",
    "secondary resonances are themselves part of a hierarchy which may extend down to smaller and smaller scales . as an illustration",
    ", we show a numerical surface of section for the saturnian satellite pandora in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . zooming in successively ,",
    "we see primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary resonant islands .",
    "we have applied the technique of lie transform perturbation theory to the planar spin - orbit problem , to second order .",
    "the full perturbative expressions are too long to include in the paper , but fortunately the main features of spin - orbit dynamics have analogs in the simpler problem of a driven double pendulum , which allows us to explain our perturbative method without excessive algebra .    we have compared our perturbative model to numerical integrations for various values of the asphericity parameter @xmath12 and the orbital eccentricity @xmath33 . if at least one of these is small ( @xmath159 or @xmath160 ) then only first order resonances are important and first order perturbation theory is adequate ; mercury and the moon lie in this regime .",
    "if the tidal perturbations become too large ( @xmath166 and @xmath167 ) then the spin becomes chaotic and perturbation theory fails altogether ; hyperion is the best - known example .",
    "however , for intermediate perturbations ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) second order resonances are possible and second order perturbation theory can reproduce them .    our perturbative model is limited to primary resonances . in particular , enceladus is thought to be in a secondary @xmath2 resonance around the primary synchronous resonance .",
    "our model smooths over secondary resonances , putting enceladus in an ordinary primary resonance .",
    "however , @xcite has shown how to recast the problem so that the secondary resonance can be correctly reproduced in perturbation theory .",
    "extending wisdom s model to second order is possible in principle , but very complicated .    so far",
    ", none of the objects whose asphericities may be found in the literature fall in the region of @xmath158 where second order perturbation theory is particularly interesting , that is , regions b and c of fig .",
    "but there is no doubt that objects in the interesting parameter range do exist , and the possibility of objects being locked in second order resonances remains open .",
    "this research was financially supported by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "we thank nick cooper , carl murray , john papaloizou , jack wisdom , and the referee for comments that improved this manuscript .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath199 has been widely studied in the literature on the transition to chaos , e.g. @xcite .",
    "several possible physical realizations of this hamiltonian are known , typically involving electric or magnetic fields . here",
    "we present another physical interpretation , which is very simple to visualize and is intuitively analogous to the the spin - orbit problem .    our physical system",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is a double pendulum with two light rods and hinges and a single bob at the end . the inner pendulum ( having length @xmath200 , say ) is made to circulate by an external motor at unit angular frequency .",
    "the outer pendulum ( having length @xmath201 , say ) is free to librate or circulate .",
    "we can write the coordinates of the bob as @xmath202 the lagrangian for the bob can be written as @xmath203 we now discard the first and last term .",
    "( the last term depends on neither of @xmath204 and hence will not contribute to the equations of motion . ) for algebraic convenience we also divide the lagrangian by @xmath205 and introduce the parameters @xmath206 . as a result of all these changes eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian1 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath207 the interpretation of @xmath208 is as follows : @xmath209 is the natural frequency of the outer pendulum relative to the driving frequency ; @xmath210 is the natural frequency of the outer pendulum relative to the inner .",
    "hence @xmath211 corresponds to the inner pendulum being driven at its natural frequency .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath212 in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian2 ] ) is @xmath213 we can simplify ( [ hpend1 ] ) using a canonical transformation .",
    "inserting the generating function for our @xmath214 . ]",
    "@xmath215 in @xmath216 and comparing coefficients of the differentials , we obtain @xmath217 using the standard trick of adding a dimension to remove the explicit time dependence , and changing notation as @xmath218 gives us the hamiltonian eq .",
