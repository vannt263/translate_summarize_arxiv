    "the six models were divided into two types : in the first type , an active individual can contact all of its neighbors at the same time . here , the outbreak threshold can vanish , regardless of the direction of propagation . in the case where active individuals are senders ( model 1a ) ,",
    "the epidemic prevalence is larger than in the case where they are receivers ( model 1b ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in model 1b , propagation from more than one infected neighbors comes to nothing . in the second type of model ,",
    "an active individual can contact only one neighbor .",
    "in contrast to the first type , when the active individuals are receivers ( model 2b ) , the epidemic prevalence is larger than that for model 2a .",
    "this result may look counterintuitive at first sight ; however , this result is not so surprising , because for model 2b , an infected individual at a hub can transmit disease to more than one individual during a timestep , in contrast to model 2a",
    ". it may be more surprising that in the case where the transmission is bidirectional ( model 2c ) , the outbreak threshold can vanish , while in the case the transmission is one way ( models 2a and 2b ) , the threshold remains finite .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the epidemic prevalence depends entirely on the mechanisms of contact and propagation .",
    "in fact , the six models handle extreme situations and may not be realistic for practical contagious diseases . however , the results of this paper have a wide - range of applications in the study of the spreading phenomena , not only for epidemic diseases but also for such things as rumors and information .",
    "this is expected to be a reference point when considering more complex models , such as ones in which the network can change dynamically ."
