    "the significance of the result lies in the fact that it implies davis inequalities : indeed , if @xmath15 is a martingale , we may apply ( [ pathdavis ] ) to each trajectory of @xmath16 and obtain a bounded and adapted process @xmath17 .",
    "the decisive observation is that , by the martingale property , @xmath18= 0,\\ ] ] so davis inequalities ( with @xmath19 ) follow from ( [ pathdavis ] ) by taking expectations .",
    "we recall that the bdg inequalities also apply if @xmath20 is a cadlag local martingale , and that this follows from a straightforward limiting procedure .",
    "moreover , the inequalities are considerably simpler to prove for _ continuous _ local martingales ( see , for example , @xcite ) ; in this case , they also hold for @xmath21 , as proved by burkholder and gundy @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the optimal values of the constants @xmath22 is delicate , and has been open for 47 years and counting ; we refer to osekowski @xcite for a discussion of the current state of research .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ history ] , we discuss the history of the pathwise approach to martingale inequalities . in section",
    "[ heuristics for the pathwise hedging approach ] , we explain the intuition behind the hedging strategy @xmath23 used in the pathwise version of davis inequality . in section  [ davis inequality for continuous local martingales ] , we give a short proof of one davis inequality for continuous martingales ; notably , this argument leads to a better constant compared to the previous literature ( to the best of our knowledge ) . in section  [ davis inequality ] , we establish theorem  [ pathdavisthm ] . in section  [ pathwise burkholder - gundy inequality ] , we use theorem  [ pathdavisthm ] to derive trajectorial versions of the bdg - inequalities in the @xmath24 case ; these also lead to their corresponding classical probabilistic counterpart , thus concluding a fully analytic derivation of theorem  [ bdgthm ] .",
    "the inspiration of the pathwise approach to martingale inequalities used in this paper comes from mathematical finance , more specifically , the theory of model - independent pricing .",
    "the starting point of the field is the paper @xcite of hobson , which introduces the idea to study option - prices by means of _ semi - static hedging _ ; we explain the concepts using the inequality @xmath25}_n",
    "\\leq3 x^*_n - ( h\\cdot x)_n\\ ] ] appearing in theorem  [ pathdavisthm ] .",
    "if the process @xmath26 describes the price evolution of a financial asset , the functions @xmath27}_n$ ] and @xmath28 have the natural financial interpretation of being exotic options ; specifically , here @xmath29 is an option on realized variance , while @xmath30 is a look - back option .",
    "the seller of the option @xmath29 pays the buyer the amount @xmath31 after the option s expiration at time @xmath32 , and @xmath33 corresponds to the gains or losses accumulated while trading in @xmath34 according to the portfolio @xmath23 .",
    "the decisive observation of hobson is that inequalities of the type ( [ semistatic ] ) can be used to derive _ robust bounds _ on the relation of the prices of @xmath29 and @xmath30 : independently of the market model , one should never trade the option @xmath29 at a price higher than the price of @xmath30 , since the payoff @xmath29 can be _ super - hedged _ using the option @xmath30 plus self - financing trading . here",
    "the _ hedge _",
    "@xmath35 is designated _ semi - static _ : it is made up of a static part ",
    "the option @xmath36 which is purchased at time @xmath37 and kept during the entire time range  plus a dynamic part which corresponds to the trading in the underlying asset according to the strategy @xmath38 .",
    "since the publication of @xcite a considerable amount of literature on the topic has evolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; we refer in particular to the survey by hobson @xcite for a very readable introduction to this area .",
    "the most important tool in model - independent finance is the skorokhod - embedding approach ; an extensive overview is given by obj in @xcite . starting with the papers @xcite the field has also been linked to the theory of optimal transport , leading to a formal development of the connection between martingale theory and robust hedging ( @xcite ) .",
    "a benefit for the theory of martingale inequalities is the following guiding principle :    _ every martingale inequality which compares expectations of two functionals has a deterministic counterpart . _    in fact , recently bouchard and nutz @xcite have coined this into a rigorous theorem in the discrete time setup , see also @xcite .",
    "this idea served as a motivation to derive the doob - maximal inequalities from deterministic , discrete - time inequalities in @xcite ..",
    "2pt in the present article , we aim to extend the approach to the case of the burkholder ",
    "davis  gundy inequalities .",
    "the aim of this section is to explain the basic intuition which lies behind the choice of the integrand in the pathwise davis inequalities .",
    "arguments are simpler in the case of brownian motion , which we will now consider .",
    "we focus on one of the two inequalities ; according to the pathwise hedging approach , we should be looking for a strategy @xmath17 and a constant @xmath39 such that @xmath40 . indeed , a reasonable ansatz to find a super hedging strategy is to search for a function @xmath41 such that @xmath42 to make an educated guess for the function @xmath43 , we argue on a _ purely heuristic _ level and consider paths which evolve in a very particular way .",
    "assume first that the path @xmath44 stays infinitesimally close to the value @xmath45 for all @xmath46 : we picture bm as a random walk on a time grid with size @xmath47 , making alternating up and down steps of height @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath49 evolves in the form @xmath50 where necessarily @xmath45 lies between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ bdg1ansatz ] ) is of course increasing , so we have to ensure the same behavior on the right side .",
    "a little calculation reveals that this means that @xmath43 should have the form @xmath53 to see this , set @xmath54 and compare the value @xmath55 with @xmath56 \\sqrt{\\mathrm{d}t } + \\mathrm{o}\\bigl(\\mathrm{d}t^{3/2}\\bigr ) \\\\ & \\approx&- f_b \\,\\mathrm{d}t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to assure that both sides of ( [ bdg1ansatz ] ) grow at the same speed , we thus need to require @xmath57 which leads to ( [ heu1 ] ) .",
    "next , we consider a path which exhibits a different kind of extreme evolution : assume that @xmath58 for some number @xmath59",
    ". simply setting @xmath60 would lead to @xmath61 .",
    "taking @xmath62 sufficiently large , this quantity would eventually supersede @xmath63 independent of the choice of @xmath39 , and thus ( [ bdg1ansatz ] ) would fail .",
    "so , this argument suggest to choose a function which is bounded ( at least for fixed @xmath64 ) .",
    "moreover , dealing with a bounded integrand would conveniently allow to follow the explanation after theorem  [ pathdavis ] and obtain davis inequalities from the pathwise davis inequalities .",
    "thus , we could consider the function @xmath65 thanks to the additional term @xmath66 in ( [ bdg1ansatz ] ) , it is not a problem if @xmath67 is violated for `` small '' values of @xmath62 ; and , if @xmath68 is large compared to @xmath69 , @xmath70 holds , thus satisfying ( [ heu1 ] ) .",
    "another similar possibility would be to use the function @xmath71 as in theorem  [ pathdavisthm ] ; the latter turns out to lead to easier computations in the discrete time case .",
    "we choose however @xmath43 given by ( [ contstrat ] ) when dealing with continuous martingales , since this allows us to obtain davis inequality with a better constant than the values we could find in the literature .",
    "we now derive one pathwise davis inequality for continuous local martingales ; integrating it yields the corresponding standard davis inequality .",
    "we notice that theorem  [ bdg1bt ] provides the constant @xmath72 , which is smaller than the optimal constant for general cadlag martingales ( which is known to be @xmath73 , see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not address here the opposite pathwise davis inequality for continuous local martingales since we are only interested in theorem [ thm4.1 ] for illustrative purposes ( since , as mentioned before , davis inequality for cadlag local martingales follows from the case of martingales in discrete time ) .",
