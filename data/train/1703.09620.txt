    "the ambition to understand , model and implement _ rational argumentation _ and _ universal logical reasoning _",
    "independent of the human brain has a long tradition in the history of humankind .",
    "it reaches back at least to the prominent study of syllogistic arguments by aristoteles . today",
    ", with the event of increasingly intelligent computer technology , the question is more topical than ever : if humans and intelligent machines are supposed to amicably coexists , interact and collaborate , appropriate forms of communication between them are required .",
    "for example , machines should be able to depict , assess and defend their ( options for ) actions and decisions in a form that is accessible to human understanding and judgement",
    ". this will be crucial for achieving a reconcilable and socially accepted integration of intelligent machines into everyday ( human ) life .",
    "the communication means between machines and humans should ideally be based on human - level , rational argumentation , which since ages forms the fundament of our social , juridical and scientific processes .",
    "current developments in artificial intelligence , in contrast , put a strong focus on statistical information , machine learning and subsymbolic representations , all of which are rather detached from human - level rational explanation , understanding and judgement .",
    "the challenge thus is to complement and enhance these human - unfriendly forms of reasoning and knowledge representation in todays artificial intelligence systems with suitable explanations amenable to human cognition , that is , rational arguments . _ via exchange of rational arguments at human - intuitive level the much needed mutual understanding and acceptance between humans and intelligent machines can eventually be guaranteed .",
    "_ this is particularly relevant for the assessment of machine actions in terms of legal , ethical , moral , social and cultural norms purported by humans .",
    "but what formalisms are available that could serve as a most general basis for the modeling of human - level rational arguments in machines ?",
    "the quest for a most general framework supporting universal reasoning and rational argumentation is very prominently represented in the works of gottfried wilhelm leibniz ( 1646 - 1716 ) .",
    "he envisioned a _",
    "scientia generalis _ founded on a _ characteristica universalis _ ,",
    "that is , a most universal formal language in which all knowledge ( and all arguments ) about the world and the sciences can be encoded .",
    "this universal logic framework should , so leibniz , be complemented with a _ calculus ratiocinator _ , an associated , most general formal calculus in which the truth of sentences expressed in the characteristica universalis should be mechanically assessable by computation .",
    "leibniz envisioned , for example , that disputes between philosophers could be resolved by formalisation and computation : _",
    "`` if this is done , whenever controversies arise , there will be no more need for arguing among two philosophers than among two mathematicians . for it will suffice to take the pens into the hand and to sit down by the abacus , saying to each other ( and if they wish also to a friend called for help ) :",
    "let us calculate . '' _",
    "( leibniz 1690 , translation by @xcite ) .",
    "leibniz visionary proposal , which became famous under the slogan _",
    "calculemus ! : `` let us calculate . '' _ , is very ambitious and far reaching : _",
    "`` if we had it [ a characteristica universalis ] , we should be able to reason in metaphysics and morals in much the same way as in geometry and analysis . '' _",
    "( leibniz 1677 , leter to gallois ; translation by russell ) .    from the perspective of the initially depicted challenge , an obvious proposal hence is to extend and adapt leibniz proposal in particular to disputes ( and interaction in general ) between humans and intelligent machines . but",
    "how realistic is a characteristica universalis and an associated calculus ratiocinator ? what has modern logic to offer ?",
    "a quick study of the survey literature on logical formalisms suggest that quite the opposite to leibniz dream has become todays reality . instead of a characteristica universalis ,",
    "a most general universal formalism supporting rigorous formalisations across all scientific disciplines , we are today actually facing a very _ rich and heterogenous zoo of different logical systems_. their development is typically motivated by e.g. different practical applications , different theoretical properties , different practical expressivity , or different schools of origin .",
    "some exemplary species in the logic zoo are briefly outlined : + 1em    many of the above logic formalisms have their origin in philosophy and they have then been picked up and further developed in e.g. computer science , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics and mathematics . instead of converging towards a single superior logic ,",
    "the logic zoo is obviously further expanding , eventually even at accelerated pace . as a consequence ,",
    "the unified vision of leibniz seems further remote from todays reality than ever before .    however , there are also some promising initiatives to counteract these diverging developments",
    ". attempts at unifying approaches to logic include categorial logic @xcite , algebraic logic  @xcite and coalgebraic logic @xcite .",
    "generally , these approaches have a strong emphasis on theory .",
    "however , some promising practical work has recently been reported utilizing the algebraic logic approach  @xcite .",
    "this paper defends another alternative at universal logical reasoning .",
    "this approach has a very pragmatic motivation , foremost reuse of tools , simplicity and elegance .",
    "it utilises classical higher - order logic ( hol ) as a unifying meta - logic in which ( the syntax and semantics ) of varying other logics can be explicitly modeled and flexibly combined .",
    "off - the - shelf higher - order interactive and automated theorem provers can then be employed to reason about and within the shallowly embedded logics .",
    "this way leibniz vision can ( at least partially ) be realised",
    ".    however , note the difference to leibniz original idea : instead of a single , universal logic formalism , the _ semantical embedding approach _ supports different competing object logics from the logic zoo .",
    "they are selected according to the specific requirements of particular applications , and , if needed , they may be combined . only at meta - level a single ,",
    "unifying logic is provided : hol ( or any richer logic incorporating hol , provided that strong automation tools for it exist ) . by unfolding the object logic encodings , problem representations are uniformly mapped to hol .",
    "this way leibniz vision is realized in an indirect way : _ universal logical reasoning is established at the meta - level in hol_.",
    "translations between logic formalisms are not new . for example , by suitably encoding kripke style semantics ( possible world semantics ) many propositional modal logics ( pmls ) can be translated to classical first - order logic ( fol )  @xcite .",
    "modulo such transformations , a range of pmls can thus be uniformly characterized as particular fragments of fol . moreover , with the help of respective ( external ) logic translation tools implementing these mappings , off - the - shelf theorem provers for fol have been turned into a practical reasoning systems for pmls .",
    "a reasoning tool based on this idea is mspass  @xcite .",
    "related approaches at generic theorem proving for different non - classical logics include the tableau - based theorem provers lotrec  @xcite , mettel  @xcite and the tableau workbench  @xcite .",
    "these systems allow the syntax and proof rules of the logic of interest to be explicitly specified in a respective interface from which they then generate a custom - tailored , tableau based theorem prover on the fly .",
    "however , they are typically restricted to propositional non - classical logics only , which significantly limits their range of applications .",
    "in particular , non - trivial rational arguments in philosophy and metaphysics are clearly beyond their scope .",
    "fact is : there are numerous reasoning tools available for pmls , but only a handful implemented systems for first - order modal logics ( foml )  @xcite . and ,",
    "prior to the semantical embedding approach , there was not a single , practically available theorem prover for higher - order modal logics ( homl ) .    in the translation approach ,",
    "which is generally not restricted to pmls and fol , the external transformation tool typically embodies and expands the semantics of the source ( aka object ) logic which it then translates into the target logic . the target logic is assumed to have equal or higher expressivity than the source logic , and the external transformation tool operates at an ( extra - logical ) meta - level in which a semantically justified bridge is established between the former and the latter . but do we actually need to segregate all these components ? why not realising the very same basic idea within one and the same logic framework ,",
    "so that the source logic , the target logic and the meta - level are all `` living '' in the same space , and so that the _ logic transformations can themselves be explicitly specified and verified by logical means _ ?",
    "this question has inspired research on shallow semantical embeddings in hol  @xcite , where the hol meta - level is utilized to explicitly model the source and target logic , and the mapping between them .",
    "moreover , in contrast to related work , the approach does not stop at the level of propositional non - classical logics , but rather puts an emphasis on first - order and higher - order quantified non - classical logics to render it amenable for more ambitious applications , including rational arguments in metaphysics , where e.g. higher - order modal logics play an important role .",
    "the choice of hol at the meta - level is thereby not by accident , but motivated as follows :    * ( a ) * for most logics in the logic zoo formal notions of semantics have been depicted based on set theoretical means .",
    "examples are the tarskian style semantics of classical predicate logic and the kripke style semantics of modal logic .",
    "hol which , thanks to its @xmath0-notation , allows sets ( e.g. @xmath1 ) to be modeled by their corresponding characteristic functions ( e.g. @xmath2 ) , is well suited to elegantly encode many such set theoretic notions of semantics explicitly in form of a simple equational theory .",
    "the fact that hol is sufficiently expressive is actually not so surprising when noting that _ an ( informal ) notion of classical higher - order logic is typically also the meta - logic of coice in most contemporary logic or maths textbooks_.    * ( b ) * _ interactive theorem proving in hol is already well supported in practice . _",
    "powerful interactive provers have been developed over the past decades , including e.g. isabelle / hol  @xcite , hol4  @xcite , hol light  @xcite and pvs  @xcite .",
    "they often come with comfortable user - interfaces and intuitive user interaction support .",
    "related proof assistants , which can also be turned into reasoners for hol , include coq  @xcite , nuprl  @xcite and lean  @xcite .",
    "note that proof assistants have recently attracted lots of attention in mathematics , for example , in the context of hales successful verification of his proof of the kepler conjecture . while human experts alone had previously failed to fully assess his proof ( this has happened for the first time in history ) his formal verification attempt within the proof assistant hol light succeeded @xcite .",
    "we will be facing an increasing number of analogous situations in the future : human and machine interactions will generate increasingly complex artefacts across all sciences , which , due to their sheer complexity and/or reasoning depth , will be deprived of traditional means of human assessment .",
    "we instead need new forms and means of scientific judgement , which again employ computer technology to overcome these challenges .",
    "however , ideally this computer technology is trusted ( e.g. verified ) and/or delivers rational arguments back in a form amenable to human understanding and judgement .    * ( c ) * _ also automated theorem proving in hol has recently made significant progress .",
    "_ theorem provers such as leo - ii  @xcite , satallax  @xcite and the model finder nitpick  @xcite have been successfully applied in a range of applications . moreover ,",
    "new reasoning systems , such as the leo - iii prover  @xcite are currently under development . * ( d ) * _ interactive and automated reasoning in hol has recently been well integrated .",
    "_ proof `` hammering '' tools @xcite , such as sledgehammer  @xciteand hol(y)hammer  @xcite , are now available .",
    "they allow the interactive users of proof assistants such as isabelle / hol and hol light to conveniently call fol and hol reasoners in the background ( even in parallel and remotely over the internet ) .",
    "suitable logic transformations are realized within these systems and results are appropriately mapped back into trusted proofs the hosting proof assistants .",
    "further projects have recently been funded in this area , including matryoshka , ai4reason and smart .",
    "these projects , which ( partly ) integrate latest machine learning techniques , will significantly further improve proof automation of routine tasks in interactive proof assistants , with the effect that users can better concentrate on challenge aspects only .",
    "[ [ so - how - does - the - semantical - embedding - approach - work ] ] so ,",
    "how does the semantical embedding approach work ?",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let l be an object logic of interest , for example , homl as often required in metaphysics . _",
    "the overall idea is to provide a lean and elegant equational theory which interprets the syntactical constituents of logic l as terms of the target ( and meta-)logic hol . _ different to the traditional translation approach , this connection , i.e. the equational theory , is itself formalized in hol .",
    "moreover , in contrast to a deep logical embedding , where ( the syntax and ) the semantics of l would be formalized in full detail , only the crucial differences in the semantics of both are addressed in the equational theory and the commonalities , such as the notions of domains , are shared .",
    "regarding the homl l and hol , for example , a crucial difference lies in the possible world semantics of l , and , hence , the equational theory provides an explicit modeling of this particular aspect of modal semantics . more concretely ,",
    "it associates the boolean valued formulas @xmath3 of l with world - predicates ( @xmath0-abstractions ) @xmath4 in hol ( where @xmath5 stands for a reserved type for worlds ) . to establish such a mapping it essentially suffices to equate the logical connectives of l ( e.g. @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) with corresponding world - lifted predicates and relations in hol ( e.g. @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where constant symbol @xmath10 denotes an accessibility relation between possible worlds ) .",
    "the mapping of constant symbols and variables of @xmath11 is then trivial , since only a type - lifting is required .",
    "most importantly , the mapping of l to hol can be given in form of a finite set of quite simple equations ( in fact , abbreviations ) ; no explicit recursive definitions are required .",
    "generally note the way in which the dependency of logic l on possible worlds is made explicit while other aspects and parameters of its semantic interpretation , such as the underlying semantic domains , remain ( implicitly ) shared between both logics .",
    "an interesting aspect is that _ the approach scales well even for first - order and higher - order quantifiers_. thus , we can identify a fragment of hol which , modulo the above sketched world - type - lifting , corresponds to homl .",
    "this may seem astonishing , since homl may appear more expressive than hol at first sight .",
    "figure [ homl ] presents such an exemplary equational theory encoded in the proof assistant isabelle / hol .",
    "formalisation tasks in challenging application areas ( such as metaphysics ) requiring homl can now be carried out within isabelle / hol by using the homl syntax as introduced .",
    "the hol meta - logic guarantees global coherence and e.g. also enables for global consistency checks . and , modulo the embeddings in hol , the automated reasoning tools available in isabelle / hol can now be reused .",
    "similar equational theories can be given for a wide range of non - classical logics ( see e.g. the logics mentioned in  [ applications ] many of which have prominent applications in artificial intelligence , computer science , philosophy , maths and computational linguistics .",
    "note that there is currently no other practically available approach in which a comparative range of logic embeddings has been established in practice .",
    "moreover , soundness and completeness of the approach has already been established for a wide range of logics ; thereby henkin semantics is typically assumed for both hol and the embedded source logics l ( in case l goes beyond first - order ) .",
    "obviously , _",
    "the range of possible applications of the approach is very wide_. in fact , due to its generality , very few conceptual limitations are known at this point .",
    "some exemplary application directions , which have already been addressed in pilot studies , are outlined . from a practical perspective",
    "a relevant question clearly is whether the theorem provers performance scales beyond small proof of concept examples .",
    "this question has to be assessed individually for each application domain .",
    "however , the experience from the pilot studies mentioned below is that _ the approach indeed matches and may even outperform human reasoning capabilities _ in individual application domains ( e.g. flaws in human refereed research papers and textbooks have been revealed ) .",
    "another reassuring fact is that in particular in the area of metaphysics the argumentation granularity ( size of single argumentation steps ) that was supported in full automatic mode by the approach well _ matched the typical argumentation granularity in human generated , rational ( masterpiece ) arguments_. moreover , note that only the propositional fragments ( and in a few cases the first - order fragments ) of the logics mentioned below have been automated in practice before . _",
    "the semantical embedding approach , however , scales for their propositional , first - order and even higher - order logic fragments .",
    "_ future work includes the widening of the range of application pilot studies , in particular , towards the modeling and assessment of rational arguments between intelligent machines and humans .",
    "it can be expected that , in the long - run , the combination of expressive quantified non - classical logics will become highly relevant in this context .      [ [ masterpiece - rational - arguments - in - metaphysics . ] ] masterpiece rational arguments in metaphysics .",

    "<S> classical higher - order logic , when utilized as a meta - logic in which various other ( classical and non - classical ) logics can be shallowly embedded , is well suited for realising a universal logic reasoning approach . </S>",
    "<S> universal logic reasoning in turn , as envisioned already by leibniz , may support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines . </S>",
    "<S> a respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of exemplary applications are discussed . in the future , universal logic reasoning in combination with appropriate , controlled forms of rational argumentation may serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines . </S>"
