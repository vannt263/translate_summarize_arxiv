    "the simplest process leading to strange particle creation in photon - nucleon interactions is the associated production of a kaon and a hyperon .",
    "the hyperon decays subsequently into specific channels .",
    "we consider the interaction of 2   gev photons ( in the laboratory reference frame ) with proton targets .",
    "we select final states consisting of a k@xmath8 and a @xmath10 or a @xmath11 pair respectively and restrict the invariant mass of these pairs to the mass range of the @xmath18 and the @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath18 decays primarily into the @xmath10 channel ( @xmath19 ) and less importantly ( @xmath20 ) into the @xmath11 channel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 decays entirely into the @xmath11 channel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 and the @xmath14 are therefore expected to dominate the production of @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs in the corresponding mass range .",
    "these resonances overlap in mass and have to be separated experimentally by distinctive decays .",
    "a particularly interesting idea is to study the @xmath14 in the @xmath21 channel @xcite .",
    "the transition between the @xmath18 and the @xmath21 channel is forbidden because the isospin clebsch - gordan coefficient vanishes .",
    "the @xmath21 decay is therefore a unique signature of the @xmath14 channel .",
    "such a measurement has not yet been performed but is intended at elsa ( bonn ) where the @xmath21 pair could be detected through a multi - photon final state ( @xmath22 ) with the crystal barrel @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath14 resonances is also presently studied in the charged decay channels , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , at spring-8/leps with incident photon energies in the range 1.5 @xmath25 gev @xcite and at elsa with the saphir detector at 2.6 gev @xcite .",
    "these channels are expected to be dominated by the @xmath14 with some contribution from the @xmath18 .",
    "there are no published cross sections yet .",
    "the only data presently available in the kinematics of interest @xcite were obtained at desy thirty years ago with space - like photons , in electroproduction experiments where the scattered electron and the produced k@xmath8 are detected in coincidence . with this method the @xmath18 and @xmath14 channel",
    "could not be separated at all .",
    "the differential cross sections for the @xmath26 reaction obtained in these measurements characterize globally strangeness production processes for missing masses ranging from 1.35 gev until 1.45 gev .",
    "an interesting trend of these data is that the t - dependence of the cross section , for given photon energy and virtuality , seems to show a sharp drop as would be expected if the dynamics were dominated by t - channel exchanges .",
    "the mandelstam variable t is defined as the square of the 4-momentum transfer from the proton target to the @xmath18 or @xmath14 .",
    "both the @xmath16 and @xmath14 resonances are located close and below the @xmath27 threshold .",
    "these resonances seem to be of rather different nature .",
    "the @xmath16 belongs to the large n@xmath28 ground state baryons and appears well - described by quark models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 is a complex baryonic state .",
    "its mass , in particular the large splitting between the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 , can not be understood in the constituent quark model with residual quark - quark interactions fitting the other low - lying baryonic states @xcite .",
    "there are many indications that the quark model description of the @xmath14 , if valid at all , requires a sizeable @xmath31 component @xcite .",
    "this observation is closely related to the early idea that the @xmath14 can be viewed as a bound kaon - nucleon system @xcite and to the later picture of the @xmath14 as a kaon - soliton bound state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 nature of the @xmath14 was also inferred from the su(3 ) cloudy bag model description @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of the @xmath14 based on chiral lagrangians @xcite suggest that this resonance is generated by meson - baryon interactions .",
    "the different nature of the @xmath16 and of the @xmath14 resonances is built in the chiral coupled - channel approach of kaon - nucleon scattering developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and which will be used in this work .",
    "the baryon resonances belonging to the large n@xmath28 ground state baryon mutiplets ( hence the @xmath16 ) are introduced explicitly as fundamental fields of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the other baryon resonances ( in particular the @xmath14 ) are generated dynamically by meson - baryon coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath14 resonances have also different spectral properties .",
    "the @xmath16 mass distribution is very close to a breit - wigner form @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of the @xmath14 departs from a breit - wigner @xcite .",
    "it depends strongly on the initial and final states through which it is measured , emphasizing the need for a full understanding of the coupling of the @xmath14 to its different decay channels .",
    "we study the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions with the idea of using future accurate data on these processes ( mainly t - distributions ) to gain understanding of the @xmath12 and of the @xmath13 amplitudes below the @xmath27 threshold , where they are dominated by the @xmath16 and @xmath14 resonances .",
    "this procedure requires that these reactions be significantly driven by the process in which the ingoing photon dissociates into a real k@xmath8 and a virtual k@xmath9 , the off - shell k@xmath9 scattering subsequently off the proton target to produce the @xmath10 or @xmath11 pair . such dynamics would show in a sharp drop of the differential cross sections @xmath32 with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "this drop has both a double pole component behaving like 1/@xmath34 and a single pole dependence going like 1/@xmath35 .",
    "the amplitude associated with the k@xmath9 t - channel exchange alone is not gauge - invariant .",
    "there are many other terms of order @xmath36 building up the gauge - invariant amplitude .",
    "we argue that the contributions from all these other terms to the cross section will not affect the double pole term , which is made gauge - invariant and entirely fixed by our calculation .",
    "this issue is of interest because the double kaon pole term contribution to the @xmath37 cross section is large ( contrary to what is found in other meson photoproduction processes as discussed below ) .",
    "our hope is that very accurate data will make it possible to isolate this term by expressing the differential cross sections @xmath32 as a superposition of double and single k@xmath9 pole terms with less singular contributions .",
    "such an information would be most useful in constraining @xmath27 dynamics at low and subthreshold energies .",
    "the @xmath38 inelastic cross sections close to threshold are indeed poorly known @xcite .",
    "we compute the t - channel k@xmath9-exchange contribution to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions for photon laboratory energies around 2 gev using the @xmath12 and @xmath13 amplitudes obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and extract the gauge - invariant double @xmath39 pole contribution for both processes .",
    "the steps of that calculation are outlined in section 2 .",
    "our numerical results for the @xmath40 and @xmath41 reactions based on the double k@xmath9 pole term are displayed and discussed in section 3 .",
    "we conclude by a few remarks in section 4 .",
    "the t - channel k@xmath9-exchange contributions to the amplitudes for the @xmath42 and @xmath41 reactions are displayed in figs . 1 and 2 .",

    "0.2 true cm in order to get nevertheless a rough feeling for the t - dependence of the cross section , we have used the old data of ref . @xcite characterizing the sum of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 processes measured with space - like photons , in electroproduction experiments .",

    "the points corresponding to @xmath49 gev@xmath47 and @xmath50 gev@xmath47 have been measured at @xmath51 gev and extrapolated to @xmath52 gev by rescaling the differential cross section according to the energy dependence predicted by our model ( i.e. an increase of about a factor of 2 ) .",
    "there is clearly a large uncertainty associated with this procedure .",
    "we consider therefore the data displayed in fig .",
    "3 only as a tenuous indication that the reaction could proceed through a t - channel exchange in qualitative agreement with the rapid fall - off expected from a dominant double k@xmath9-pole term .",
    "it should be noted however that there are no good reasons to expect significant s - channel contributions to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions at e@xmath53 gev .",
    "the corresponding total center of mass energy in these kinematics is @xmath54 gev .",
    "there are no baryon resonances in that mass range known to decay into the @xmath55 or @xmath56 channels .",
    "it is interesting to recall that , for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 reactions at e@xmath53 gev , the dominance of the k@xmath9-exchange at low t could be inferred from photo- and electroproduction data @xcite .",
    "the importance of the @xmath59(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances in the @xmath60 dynamics close to threshold provides additional grounds for expecting a similar picture to hold for the @xmath58(1385 ) and @xmath57(1405 ) reactions .",
    "we calculate the cross section for the @xmath61 , where y denotes either the @xmath62 or the @xmath63 .",
    "the 4-momenta of the photon , the proton , the k@xmath8 , the pion and the hyperon are denoted by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the photon , proton and hyperon polarizations are indicated by the symbols @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the total cross section reads @xmath72 the first step of the calculation is to factorize the full amplitude @xmath73 into the photon - kaon vertex and the @xmath74 amplitude in accordance with the reaction mechanism depicted in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "we have @xmath75 we work in the photon - proton center of mass reference frame where the total energy of the reaction is denoted by @xmath76 . in that reference frame , the photon 3-momentum is -@xmath77 and the 3-momentum of the @xmath78 pair is -@xmath79 .",
    "it is useful to define the invariant mass @xmath80 of the final @xmath78 pair by @xmath81 and to express the 4-momentum transfer @xmath82 as function of that variable , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the angle between the initial photon and the produced kaon .    using these variables , the total cross section ( 1 )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is convenient to express eq .",
    "( 5 ) in terms of the total @xmath88 cross section , @xmath89 .",
    "this quantity is frame independent .",
    "its expression in the @xmath90 center of mass reads @xmath91 in which @xmath92 is the @xmath39 momentum in the @xmath90 center of mass .",
    "its value as function of the total center of mass energy @xmath93 of the @xmath90 system is given by @xmath94    the doubly differential cross section @xmath95 can be written as @xmath96    we remark first that the amplitude @xmath73 obtained by calculating the graph of fig .",
    "1 ( or fig .",
    "2 ) is not gauge - invariant . to obtain the full gauge - invariant amplitude , all the other diagrams of order @xmath36 leading to the same final state should be added . in the energy range under consideration ( e@xmath53 gev ) , there are many possible diagrams involving poorly known couplings and hence large uncertainties .    instead of attempting to calculate these graphs ,",
    "we resort to the pole scheme method @xcite .",
    "this technique was used to derive gauge - invariant results in the vicinity of a pole for electroweak processes involving radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is to decompose the amplitude according to its pole structure and to expand it around the pole . to any order in perturbation theory ,",
    "the residues of the poles are gauge - invariant .",
    "the expansion provides therefore subsets of gauge - invariant expressions associated with a given pole structure .",
    "we apply this method to derive the gauge - invariant cross section corresponding to the double k@xmath9-pole term to first order in @xmath36 .",
    "we expect this term to play a significant role in the @xmath97 process .",
    "the key point is that the graph of fig .",
    "1 ( or fig .",
    "2 ) is the only process which can contribute to the double k@xmath9-pole term .",
    "we will therefore decompose the corresponding cross section according to its pole structure , keep only the double k@xmath9-pole term and extract the gauge - invariant cross section associated with that pole structure by calculating the residue at the pole .    according to this procedure ,",
    "the gauge - invariant cross section corresponding to the double k@xmath9-pole term reads @xmath98    we stress that the double pole term is the only one which can be determined this way , because it does not get contributions from any other graph but the t - channel kaon - exchange diagram .",
    "in contrast , the single pole term is built up as a sum of many processes , in particular the interference of the t - channel kaon - exchange diagram with s- and u - channel terms .    in order to be able to extract the double pole term from accurate t - distributions",
    ", it has to be reasonably large .",
    "we speculate so in view of the numerical results discussed in the next section .",
    "as shown earlier , it is also compatible with the few data points available .",
    "we emphasize that this would be a specific behaviour of the @xmath99 reactions .",
    "the situation is indeed different in other meson photoproduction processes , even when they are dominated by t - channel exchanges .",
    "it is interesting to consider for example the pole structure for the photoproduction of @xmath100-mesons in the energy range @xmath101 gev . in these kinematics ,",
    "the @xmath102 reaction is expected to be well described by a simple pion - exchange diagram for small momentum transfers and with standard form factors @xcite .",
    "we use the specific model of ref .",
    "@xcite . neglecting the t - dependence of the form factors and concentrating on the pole structure of the differential cross section in the limit of local couplings",
    ", we have    @xmath103    we see that the differential cross section behaviour is dominated by the single pion pole term .",
    "the double pion pole is small and even negative .",
    "it acts as a minor correction to the cross section , as a consequence of the smallness of the pion mass .",
    "the pole scheme technique used above is not predictive in this case and the dominant single pion pole term has to be determined phenomenologically . as a consequence of this observation , the effective @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    "couplings are not constrained directly by the data and depend on further assumptions such as the form factors assigned to the vertices .",
    "we remark that the particular form of the couplings chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite makes the full pion - exchange diagram gauge - invariant , irrespectively of its pole structure .    to characterize the momentum transfer dependence of the @xmath74 cross section",
    ", one can define the variable @xmath106 and generalize eq.(9 ) to the threefold differential cross section    @xmath107    we focus on the @xmath108 reaction by integrating over t , using the kinematic boundaries @xmath109 and @xmath110 defined after eq .",
    "we have @xmath111    or    @xmath112    the nontrivial dynamical quantity of interest in eq .",
    "( 13 ) is clearly @xmath113 + @xmath114 .    to calculate this cross section we use the @xmath115 amplitudes derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian by solving coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "we will not repeat here the technical developments involved in this scheme . they are explained and discussed extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this effective field theory achieves an excellent description of the available data on @xmath116 elastic ( direct and charge - exchange ) and inelastic ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) processes up to laboratory @xmath39 momenta of the order of 500 mev .",
    "the interest of the present work is to offer the possibility of testing the amplitudes below the @xmath27 threshold , in the region where they are dominated by the @xmath5(1405 ) and the @xmath4(1385 ) .",
    "the specific spectral shape of these resonances is a particularly meaningful prediction of the description of ref .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the shape of the @xmath4(1385 ) resonance is expected to be close to a breit - wigner form .",
    "the @xmath5(1405 ) resonance mass distribution has an asymmetric shape and depends on the initial and final states through which it is observed .",
    "the @xmath117 production would also put strong constraints on the @xmath4(1385)@xmath121 coupling which is poorly known .",
    "we present our numerical results in three different perspectives .",
    "we restrict our calculations to cross sections integrated over @xmath122 .",

    "our predicted cross sections are displayed in fig .  4 for the @xmath127 and @xmath128 reactions and in fig . 5 for the @xmath129 and @xmath130 reactions .",
    "they are compared to the data available above threshold @xcite .",
    "0.4 true cm    we recall that the @xmath131 channel is dominated by the @xmath5(1405 ) and the @xmath132 channel by the @xmath4(1385 ) .",
    "the properties of the spectral functions of the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances are very apparent in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "the shape of the resonant behaviour of the @xmath130 cross section below threshold is quite symmetric and close to a breit - wigner form .",
    "the s - wave contribution is small as expected for a process dominated by a p - wave resonance .",
    "in contrast , the spectral form of the @xmath133 cross sections for the three possible @xmath131 channels is asymmetric and largely given by s - wave dynamics , reflecting the @xmath5(1405 ) dominance .",
    "the grey histograms show ( in arbitrary units ) the empirical shape of the @xmath14 resonance extracted from the @xmath134 reaction at 1.5 - 2.4 gev photon energy @xcite . it should be emphasized that strictly speaking the comparison implied by fig .",
    "4 is not yet justified . only after extracting the double kaon pole contribution from the cross section by a detailed study of t - distributions",
    "can this comparison become legitimate .",
    "the result of such an analysis is expected to resolve the discrepancy of the histograms and the @xmath90 scattering data , at least above threshold .",
    "nevertheless , the different line shapes of @xcite seems to confirm the prediction of chiral coupled - channel dynamics that the spectral shape of the @xmath14 resonance depends crucially on the initial and final states it is probed with @xcite .",
    "we note that the available @xmath90 scattering data close to threshold have large error bars , emphasizing the interest of being able to determine from experiment the subthreshold @xmath90 scattering amplitudes by extracting the double kaon pole contributions to the @xmath135 reactions calculated in this work",
    ".    0.4 true cm    we display in figs . 6 and 7 the double kaon pole term contributions to the differential cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions as functions of the @xmath136 total center of mass energy @xmath124 at @xmath137 gev and @xmath138 gev .    0.4 true cm    0.4 true cm    they reflect clearly the dynamical features discussed in commenting on figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "it is also interesting to note the absolute values of the double kaon pole cross sections .",
    "they are large on the scale of what is expected from other theoretical approaches . if we compare our results to the predictions of the model of ref .",

    "it is not easy to trace the origin of this effect .",
    "our gauge - invariant double kaon pole term contains contributions which can not be mapped easily onto the feynman diagrams computed in ref . @xcite .",
    "the cross section we obtain for the @xmath117 channel is about an order of magnitude larger than the result displayed in ref .",
    "a substantial part of this effect should be ascribed to the neglect of the @xmath4(1385 ) resonance in that work .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions are studied in the kinematic region where the @xmath2(1116 ) and @xmath3(1192 ) pairs originate dominantly from the decay of the @xmath4(1385 ) and @xmath5(1405 ) resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we consider laboratory photon energies around 2 gev , significantly above the threshold for producing the @xmath6(1385 ) and @xmath7(1405 ) final states . </S>",
    "<S> we compute for both reactions the process in which the ingoing photon dissociates into a real k@xmath8 and a virtual k@xmath9 , the off - shell k@xmath9 scattering subsequently off the proton target to produce the @xmath10 or @xmath11 pair . the @xmath12 and @xmath13 amplitudes are calculated in the framework of a chiral coupled - channel effective field theory of meson - baryon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the amplitudes reflects the dominance of the @xmath14 in the @xmath15 channel and of the @xmath16 in the @xmath17 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the full pion - hyperon final state interaction is included in these amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we extract from the calculated cross section the gauge - invariant double kaon pole term . </S>",
    "<S> we found this term to be large and leading to sizeable cross sections for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions , in qualitative agreement with the scarce data presently available . </S>",
    "<S> accurate measurements of these cross sections should make it possible to extract the contribution of the double kaon pole and hence to assess the possibility of studying kaon - nucleon dynamics just below threshold through these reactions .    </S>",
