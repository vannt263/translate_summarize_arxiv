    "the consequences of chaotic dynamics can be harmful in several contexts . during the last decade or so",
    ", much attention has been paid to the problem of chaos control .",
    "controlling chaos means that one aims at reducing or suppressing chaos by mean of a small perturbation so that the original structure of the system under investigation is kept practically unaltered , while its behavior can be substantially altered .",
    "in particular , in many physical devices there are undesirable effects due to transport phenomena that can be attributed to a chaotic dynamics .",
    "for example , chaos in beams of particle accelerators leads to a weakening of the beam luminosity  @xcite .",
    "similar problems are encountered in free electron lasers  @xcite . in magnetically confined fusion plasmas ,",
    "the so called anomalous transport , which has its microscopic origin in a chaotic transport of charged particles , represents a challenge to the attainment of high performance in fusion devices  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the physics of these devices ( beam accelerators , free electron lasers , fusion devices ) is based on hamiltonian models , thus the above mentioned possibility of harmful consequences of chaos is related with hamiltonian chaos .",
    "one way to control transport would be that of reducing or suppressing chaos . there exist numerous attempts to cope with this problem  @xcite .",
    "however , these efforts have mainly been focused on dissipative systems . for hamiltonian systems ,",
    "the absence of phase space attractors has been a hindrance to the development of efficient methods of control .",
    "conventional approaches aim at targeting individual trajectories .",
    "however , when a microscopic description of a physical system is required , targeting of individual microscopic trajectories is hopeless .",
    "the strategy we developed is based on a small but suitable modification of the original hamiltonian system such that the controlled one has a more regular dynamics . in this article",
    "this strategy is illustrated through a particular example : how to restore kinetic coherence of a cold electron beam interacting with electrostatic waves . here",
    "chaos deteriorates the velocity `` monochromaticity '' of the injected beam and one has to find a strategy of control such that this effect is reduced or suppressed .",
    "the hamiltonian which models the dynamics of charged test particles moving in electrostatic waves is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the test charged particle momentum and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the amplitudes , wave numbers , frequencies and phases of the electrostatic waves .",
    "generically , for @xmath6 , the dynamics of the particles governed by this equation is a mixture of regular and chaotic behaviours mainly depending on the amplitude of the waves .     of the velocity for the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hstart ] ) without control term ( left panel ) and with the control term given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : f2app ] ) ( right panel ) .",
    "the depicted numerical results are obtained in the case of two electrostatic waves using @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "reprinted from ref .",

    "[ fig_num_twt ] for two waves ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a large zone of chaotic behaviour occurs in between the primary resonances ( nested regular structures ) .",
    "if one considers a beam of initially monokinetic particles , this zone is associated with a large spread of the velocities after some time ( left hand side panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_num_twt ] ) since the particles are moving in the chaotic sea created by the overlap of the two resonances  @xcite . here",
    "the problem of control is to find a control term @xmath10 given by @xmath11 that is the right set of additional controlling waves , such that the controlled hamiltonian @xmath12 given by the original one plus the control term , is more regular than @xmath13 . in general , adding a generic perturbation adds more resonances and hence more chaos .",
    "nevertheless this problem has some obvious solutions with additional waves having amplitudes of the same order as the initial ones . for energetic purposes",
    ", the additional waves must have amplitudes which are much smaller than the initial ones ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this means finding a specifically designed small control term that is a slight modification of the system but which drastically changes the dynamical behaviour from chaotic to regular",
    ". in particular one aims at building barriers to transport that prevent large scale chaos to occur in the system .",
    "in this section we briefly sketch the local control method that was extensively discussed in refs .",
    "let us consider hamiltonian systems of the form @xmath15 that after a suitable expansion can be rewritten as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are action - angle variables for @xmath18 in a phase space of dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the last term of the expansion can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is quadratic in the actions , i.e.  @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is a non - resonant vector of @xmath25 , i.e.  there is no non - zero @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "moreover we assume without restrictions that @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a region near @xmath29 .",
    "the controlled hamiltonian we construct is given by @xmath30 the control term depends only on angle variables and its expression is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the first derivatives of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34  : @xmath35 and where the linear operator @xmath36 is a pseudo - inverse of @xmath37 , i.e. its action on a function @xmath38 is  : @xmath39    we prove ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath40 has an invariant torus located at @xmath41 . for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom ,",
    "such an invariant torus acts as a barrier to diffusion . for the construction of the control term",
    ", we notice that we do not require that the quadratic part of @xmath42 is small in order to have a control term of order @xmath43 .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian with two traveling waves : @xmath44 where the wavenumbers are chosen according to a given dispersion relation @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the numerical results we will show in the following have been obtained using @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "similar results are expected for other values of @xmath49 .     as a function of @xmath50 for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hfp ] ) ( left panel ) and for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hfp ] ) plus the control term  ( [ eqn : ftwt ] ) ( right panel ) .",

    "it shows that after @xmath53 there is no longer any barrier in phase space .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath54 for which the last invariant torus is broken is approximately equal to @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "the first step in order to compute the local control term which recreates a barrier in phase space is to map this hamiltonian with one and a half degrees of freedom into an autonomous hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom by considering that @xmath56 is an additional angle variable .",
    "we denote @xmath57 its conjugate action .",

    "[ figure1twt ] ( right panel ) the recreation of barrier in phase space can be observed on the probability distribution function of the momenta of a trajectory of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hfp ] ) plus the control term  ( [ eqn : ftwt ] ) for @xmath51 $ ] ( with initial condition chosen as in the uncontrolled case , e.g. for @xmath71 ) .",
    "in fact for all the values of the amplitude @xmath50 of the perturbation , the kinetic coherence of the initial electron beam is preserved .",
