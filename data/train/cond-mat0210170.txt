    "the problem of superparamagnetic relaxation in single - domain ferroparticles formulated , explained and basically analyzed by nel@xcite about fifty years ago , since then keeps to attract attention . nowadays",
    "this interest is mainly due to the expanding number of nanometer granular magnetic media used in information storage and related high technologies .",
    "when analyzing magnetic dispersions , solid or fluid , a promising idea is to evaluate the granulometric content , particle material parameters and relaxation rates by combining the data on linear and nonlinear dynamic susceptibilities .",
    "since recently , this approach ( it originates from the spin glass science ) became quite feasible in experimental realization.@xcite however , to benefit from it , one needs an adequate model .",
    "surprisingly , until nowadays the nel@xcite concept of superparamagnetic behavior of fine magnetic particles that had been substantially advanced by brown@xcite and refined by numerous researchers ( see the review article@xcite with about 400 references ) , lacks a nonlinear extension .    in ref .",
    "we begun to fill up this gap and proposed a numerical procedure involving continuous fractions by means of which the linear and cubic susceptibilities for a solid system of uniaxial fine particles could be obtained . with allowance for the polydispersity of real samples ,",
    "the worked out description provided a fairly good agreement with the dynamic magnetic measurements taken on co - cu nanocomposites.@xcite recently , our approach was used successfully@xcite for the linear and cubic susceptibilities of the samples of randomly oriented @xmath0-fe@xmath1o@xmath2 nanoparticles .",
    "hereby we carry on the build - up of the nonlinear superparamagnetic relaxation theory by working out a set of compact and accurate analytical expressions that considerably facilitate calculations as well as experiment interpretation .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss the problem of superparamagnetic relaxation and show the way to obtain the asymptotic solution for the micromagnetic fokker - planck equation in the uniaxial case . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] the perturbative expansions for the orientational distribution function are obtained , which are used in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] to construct asymptotic expressions for the nonlinear dynamic susceptibilities .",
    "the explicit forms of those expansions are given and their accuracy is proved by comparison with the results of numerical calculations .",
    "[ sec:5 ] contains the enveloping discussion .",
    "the cornerstone of the superparamagnetic relaxation theory is the arrhenius - like law for the relaxation rate of a magnetic moment of a single domain particle predicted by nel in 1949 .",
    "the framework of this classical problem is as follows .",
    "consider an immobile ( e.g.  fixed inside a solid matrix ) single - domain grain of a volume @xmath3 .",
    "this particle possesses a uniaxial volume magnetic anisotropy , @xmath4 being its energy density and @xmath5 its easy axis direction .",
    "since the temperature @xmath6 is assumed to be much lower than the curie point , the particle magnetization @xmath7 , as a specific parameter , is practically constant and the magnitude of the particle magnetic moment may be written as @xmath8 . denoting its direction by a unit vector @xmath9 ,",
    "one concludes that the magnetic state of such a particle is exhaustively characterized by a pair of vectors : @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "thence , the orientation - dependent part of the particle energy ( in the absence of external magnetic fields ) is @xmath11 where @xmath4 is assumed to be positive . as eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) shows , this energy has two equal minima .",
    "they are separated by the potential barrier of the height @xmath12 and correspond to @xmath13 because for the magnetic moment @xmath9 the directions @xmath5 and @xmath14 are equivalent . at zero temperature , the magnetic moment @xmath9 , once located in a particular potential well , is confined there forever . at finite temperature , the probability of an overbarrier ( interwell ) transition becomes non - zero . if the ratio @xmath15 is high enough , the transition rate is exponential thus yielding the nel law @xmath16 for the reference time @xmath17 of the particle re - magnetization .",
    "brown@xcite shaped up those semi - qualitative considerations into a rigorous sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem by deriving the micromagnetic kinetic equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the orientational distribution function of the magnetic moment , @xmath20 is the infinitesimal rotation operator with respect to @xmath9 , and the time @xmath21 is introduced below by formula ( [ eq:04 ] ) .",
    "generally speaking , equation  ( [ eq:02 ] ) is incomplete since a gyromagnetic term is absent there .",
    "this means that the consideration is limited by the frequency range @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relaxation time of the larmor precession of the particle magnetic moment in the internal anisotropy field @xmath24 , where @xmath4 includes the possible shape contribution . comparing this condition with the other one , @xmath25 , that evidences a low - to - moderate quality factor of the larmor precession for real nanodisperse ferrites , one estimates the allowed frequency as @xmath26 that means , in fact , a fairly wide range .",
    "is very long , i.e. , the quality factor of precession is very high",
    ". then the gyromagnetic term in the kinetic equation must be retained so that larmor precession begins to interact with the superparamagnetic ( longitudinal ) relaxation .",
    "an example of such a situation is considered in ref .  , where some interesting nonlinear effects are found . ]    in the statistical description delivered by eq .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) , the observed ( macroscopic ) magnetic moment per particle is given by the average @xmath27 note that with allowance for eq .",

    "we adopt the former one .",
    "thence , the reference relaxation time in eq .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) writes as @xmath30 where @xmath0 is the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons and @xmath31 is the precession damping ( spin - lattice relaxation ) phenomenological parameter .    assuming uniaxial symmetry of the time - dependent solution and separating the variables in eq .",

    "we remark that under condition @xmath40 ,",
    "i.e. , far from the ferromagnetic resonance range , the transversal components of @xmath41 are of minor importance .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:06 ] ) describes the temperature - induced ( fluctuation ) motions of the vector @xmath9 in the orientational potential with a symmetrical profile  ( [ eq:01 ] ) .",
    "with respect to the time dependence , the set of possible eigenmodes splits into two categories : interwell ( overbarrier ) transitions and intrawell wanderings . in the spectral problem  ( [ eq:06 ] )",
    "the interwell transitions of the magnetic moment are associated with the single eigenvalue @xmath42 . as the rigorous analysis shows,@xcite it drastically differs from the others : whereas for @xmath43 all the @xmath35 gradually _ grow _ with @xmath44 , the decrement @xmath42 exponentially _ falls down _ proportionally to @xmath45 .    in the opposite limit @xmath46 , all the decrements , including @xmath42 , tend to the sequence @xmath47 and thus become of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this regime corresponds to a vanishing anisotropy so that the difference between the inter- and intrawell motions disappear , and the magnetic moment diffuses almost freely over all the @xmath48 radians with the reference time @xmath21 introduced by eq .",
    "( [ eq:04 ] ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:03 ] ) and ( [ eq:05 ] ) one finds that the longitudinal component of the magnetic moment evolves according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 . for a symmetrical potential like  ( [ eq:01 ] )",

    "( [ eq:09 ] ) , being proportional to @xmath53 , at @xmath54 is far more long - living than any other one .",
    "the dominating rle of the decrement @xmath42 had been proven by brown , and for it he had derived@xcite the asymptotic expression @xmath55 in a short time after , using a continued fraction method , aharoni constructed@xcite for @xmath42 a fairly long power series in @xmath44 and also showed numerically that brown s expression  ( [ eq:10 ] ) resembles the exact one with the accuracy of several percent for @xmath56 . in the 90 s the eigenvalue @xmath42 became a subject of extensive studies .",
    "efficient numerical procedures were developed @xcite and a number of extrapolation formulas with a good overall accuracy were proposed@xcite .",
    "the study that we describe below was inspired by our work on fitting the dynamic susceptibilities measurements for real assemblies of fine particles .",
    "those data typically describe polydisperse systems in the low - frequency bandwidth @xmath5710@xmath58hz . as @xmath59s or smaller , then , using formula  ( [ eq:10 ] ) for estimations , one concludes that the mentioned frequency interval becomes a dispersion range for the interwell ( superparamagnetic ) mode at @xmath60 for temperatures up to 300k this condition holds for quite a number of nanomagnetic systems .",
    "application of the best fit procedure to a set of experimental data implies numerous re - calculations of the linear and non - linear susceptibility curves @xmath61 of the assembly .",
    "any such curve , due to a considerable polydispersity of the particles , is a superposition of a great number of partial curves @xmath62 spread over a wide size ( or , in the dimensionless form , @xmath44 ) range . for successful processing , one needs a fast and very accurate algorithm to evaluate @xmath62 everywhere including the domain @xmath63 .",
    "the existing extrapolation formulas are no good for that purpose due to their ill - controllable error accumulation .",
    "a plausible way out is an asymptotic in @xmath64 solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:06 ] ) . in the course of the fitting procedure",
    ", this approximation can be easily matched in the intermediate @xmath44 range with the well - known expansions for the small @xmath44 end .",

    "<S> the micromagnetic fokker - planck equation is solved for a uniaxial particle in the low - temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic series in the parameter that is the inverse barrier height  to  temperature ratio are derived . with the aid of these series , the expressions for the superparamagnetic relaxation time and the odd - order dynamic susceptibilities are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained formulas are both quite compact and practically exact in the low ( with respect to fmr ) frequency range that is proved by comparison with the numerically - exact solution of the micromagnetic equation . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibilities formulas contain angular dependencies that allow to consider textured as well as randomly oriented particle assemblies . </S>",
    "<S> our results advance the previous two - level model for nonlinear superparamagnetic relaxation . </S>"
