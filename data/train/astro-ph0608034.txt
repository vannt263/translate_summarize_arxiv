    "one of the most profound discoveries of observational physics is that the universe is accelerating in its expansion  @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain this late - time acceleration , for example , a pure cosmological constant , dark energy associated with some new scalar field and modified gravitational theories , although all current models require some level of fine - tuning and none are considered to be a complete explanation  .",
    "whatever is responsible for the current acceleration may arise from some completely new physical principle .",
    "this is the possibility we consider in this paper .",
    "our goal is to construct a toy model that represents a late - time accelerating universe using a new , possibly fundamental , principle .",
    "as our guiding principle , we hypothesize the existence of a _ minimal curvature _ scale in gravity .    in a friedmann , robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time , without cosmological constant @xmath0 and with only standard matter sources such as dust and radiation",
    ", the universe will always decelerate as it expands .",
    "one way to avoid this is to add matter to the system that violates the strong energy condition ( sec ) . in a cosmological context",
    "this violation constitutes the addition of matter sources satisfying the equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "a second possibility is to explicitly remove flat space - time as a solution to the theory . in this case",
    "the vacuum of the theory , which is approached at late times as the energy density in matter fields becomes more and more dilute , is not minkowski space - time , but instead an accelerating universe  @xcite . to remove flat spacetime as a solution we hypothesize the existence of a minimal curvature in our underlying fundamental theory .",
    "the simplest example of this is , of course , to introduce a bare cosmological constant into general relativity .",
    "however , in principle there may exist many other ways to achieve this result .",
    "indeed , it appears that many accelerating cosmological models derived from modified gravity theories contain such a minimal curvature  @xcite .    the idea of a minimal curvature scale in gravity mirrors that of a maximal curvature scale . in the literature",
    "many authors have considered this possibility and used it to remove the curvature singularities of general relativity by bounding curvature invariants from above at the level of the classical action  @xcite-@xcite . in the case of singularity removal , it is necessary to bound _ all _ curvature invariants in order to cover all possible physical situations in which such a singularity may occur .    by contrast , in the case of a minimal curvature approached at late times in a homogeneous , isotropic universe , symmetry implies that it is only necessary to bound the ricci scalar @xmath2 from below .",
    "hence , unlike in the case of a maximal curvature hypothesis , we shall see that one may implement a minimal curvature by using a modified brans - dicke theory where the brans - dicke field couples non - minimally to the matter lagrangian .    within this context",
    "we demonstrate that the existence of the minimal curvature ( mc ) produces a universe that evolves from a matter dominated period to an accelerating phase mimicking the @xmath0-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model .",
    "we emphasize that the model presented here is only a _ toy construction of the late universe .",
    "the model is not intended to provide a consistent cosmology from the time of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) until today .",
    "it is unlikely that the precise model presented here is compatible with solar system experiments and the tight constraints on the time variation of newton s constant .",
    "however , the model _ does provide an example of how the postulated existence of a minimal curvature scale in gravity can provide a new mechanism to generate cosmological acceleration of the late universe .",
    "furthermore , the model may capture features of a possibly more fundamental theory that admits a minimal curvature scale  .",
    "_ _    in section  [ sec : mc ] , we describe the minimal curvature construction , first by using a toy example and then by using a class of modified brans - dicke theories .",
    "we solve the equations of motion for this example and demonstrate how the universe evolves from a matter dominated phase to an accelerating period as the curvature approaches its minimal value . in section  [ sec : comp",
    "] , we compare the mc model with @xmath0cdm and to the supernovae ( sneia )  gold \" sample of  @xcite .",
    "finally , we comment on the possibility of constructing more realistic models that satisfy the limiting curvature hypothesis and offer our conclusions and speculations in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in appendix",
    "a , we provide a detailed analysis of the vacuum mc theory . in appendix",
    "b , we construct an einstein frame description of the vacuum theory and compare it to the mc vacuum .",
    "our goal is to construct theories in which a certain physical quantity is bounded from below . before leaping directly into our model , it is instructive to consider an example of how a similar effect may be achieved in a simpler theory - the bounding of velocities from above in special relativity by the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "the newtonian action for a free particle of mass @xmath3 in motion is [ old ] s = dt m x^2  . in this classical theory",
    "the velocity of the particle is _ without bound_. now let us implement one of the fundamental consequences of special relativity : to ensure that the speed of this particle is _ limited _ by the speed of light we introduce a field @xmath4 which couples to the quantity in the action that we want to bound ( @xmath5 ) and has a  potential \" @xmath6 . the resulting action is [ newa ] s = m dt  .",
    "the variational equation with respect to @xmath7 [ bit ] x^2 =  , ensures that @xmath8 is bounded , provided @xmath9 is bounded .",
    "note the absence of a kinetic term for @xmath10 in the action , and hence , the reason the word _ potential appears in quotes above . in order to obtain the correct newtonian limit for small @xmath8 and small @xmath7 we take @xmath6 proportional to @xmath11 . in the newtonian limit the action ( [ newa ] ) reduces to ( [ old ] ) .",
    "a simple potential satisfying the above asymptotics is u ( ) =  . integrating out @xmath7 yields ( up to an irrelevant constant ) the action for relativistic particle motion : s_sr = m dt .",
    "the above model provides a powerful example of how a toy construction based on a fundamental principle  the existence of a universal  speed limit \"  can capture features of a more fundamental theory . _",
    "we now use a similar construction to model the existence of a _ minimal _ curvature ( mc ) scale in gravity . because we are interested in late time cosmology , we need",
    "only be concerned with bounding one curvature invariant , the ricci scalar @xmath2 . in direct analogy with our example from special relativity ,",
    "we introduce a scalar field @xmath12 that couples to the quantity we wish to bound , @xmath2 , and a  potential \" function @xmath13 [ act2 ] s_mc = d^4 x ( r - r + v ( ) )  , where @xmath14 is the reduced planck mass and both @xmath12 and @xmath15 posses dimensions of mass , @xmath16 = [ \\g]=m$ ] . the vacuum theory is equivalent to a brans - dicke theory with brans - dicke parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this is seen by re - writing the action ( [ act2 ] ) in terms of a new field [ newp ] = ( - ) , so that the action becomes [ actbd ] s_bd = d^4 x ( r + v ( ) ) .    ordinarily , such a theory can be re - cast as a purely gravitational theory with lagrangian @xmath18 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) ; however , this is not possible for all forms of the potential @xmath19 .    for reasons that will become clear",
    "shortly , we allow the field @xmath12 to couple non - minimally to matter .",
    "the non - minimal coupling yields the matter action , [ actmat ] s_m = d^4 x _ m(_i , , f(/m_pl ) | ) , where @xmath20 is the lagrangian made up of whatever matter fields @xmath21 are in the theory . in the case were @xmath22 represents a dark matter dirac spinor , the field @xmath12 couples non - minimally _ only to the dark matter sector and need not couple to baryons . in this case",
    "it is possible to avoid constraints on such a coupling from solar - system and table - top tests of gravity . in string theory ,",
    "non - perturbative string loop effects do not generically lead to universal couplings , allowing the possibility that the dilaton decouples more slowly from dark matter than ordinary matter ( see , e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "_    this coupling can be used to address the coincidence problem , since the acceleration is triggered by the coupling to matter . for the purposes of our toy construction",
    ", we do not distinguish between baryonic and dark matter in the remainder of our discussion .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath23 theories which are conformally identical to models of quintessence in which matter is coupled to dark energy with a large coupling , this strong coupling induces a cosmological evolution radically different from standard cosmology  @xcite .",

    "physically the minimal curvature corresponds to an emptying of the matter in the universe due to cosmological expansion . in our model",

    "today , the value of the curvature is given by [ rprox ] r_0 = 6 ( 2 h_0 ^ 2 + h_0 ) 12 h_0 ^ 2 . because we observe a significant amount a matter in the universe today , we know that we have not yet reached the minimal curvature . however , because we are accelerating , we know that we are _ near the minimal curvature ( i.e.  the first and second terms on the right hand side of equation  ( [ simple ] ) must be comparable ) .",
    "hence , from equation  ( [ rprox ] ) , we expect the value of the minimal curvature @xmath78 to be close to but less than @xmath84 . therefore , in terms of our dimensionless quantities ( [ dimen ] ) , @xmath85 and the free parameter in our theory @xmath86 . for the solutions considered below ,",
    "we choose a value of @xmath81 meeting the above requirements and that follows the @xmath0cdm model to our satisfaction for our toy construction ( i.e. a value leading to a matter dominated cosmology followed by a  jerk \" near a redshift of @xmath87 into an accelerating phase ) .",

    "we are almost in a position to compare our model both with @xmath0cdm , which has the friedmann equation [ lcdm ] h = , and with the observational data provided by the sneia gold sample . to make a comparison with the observational data we require an understanding of the luminosity distance formula in the context of modified gravity models .",
    "an important consideration arises when using the formula for the luminosity distance in theories of the form : [ modact ] s = d^4 x , where the @xmath91 represent the different types of possible matter lagrangians present .",
    "such a theory arises as the low - energy effective action for the massless modes of dilaton gravity in string theory , and our model is an action of just this sort  @xcite ; albeit , with an unusual choice for the functions @xmath92 .",
    "as we have already discussed , these theories typically lead to time variation in newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the time variation can affect the way one should compare the theory to observations  @xcite . in particular , the time - evolution can alter the basic physics of supernovae .",
    "for example , the time variation in @xmath93 leads to different values of the chandrasekhar mass at different epochs , and hence , a supernova s peak luminosity will vary depending on when the supernova exploded .",
    "this makes treating the supernovae ia as standard candles difficult  @xcite . specifically , the peak luminosity of sneia is proportional to the mass of nickel synthesized which is a fixed fraction of the chandrasekhar mass @xmath94 .",
    "hence , the luminosity peak of sneia varies as @xmath95 and the corresponding absolute magnitude evolves as m = m_0 + , where the subscript zero indicates the local values of the quantities .",
    "therefore , the magnitude - redshift relation of sneia in modified gravity theories of the type given by ( [ modact ] ) is related to the luminosity distance via  @xcite : m(z ) = m_0 + 5 + .",
    "even if gravitational physics is described by some theory other than general relativity the standard formula for the luminosity distance applies as long as one is considering a metric theory of gravity  @xcite : [ lumd ] d_l(z ; h(z ) , h_0 ) = _ 0^z . for @xmath0cdm , the luminosity distance ( [ lumd ] )",
