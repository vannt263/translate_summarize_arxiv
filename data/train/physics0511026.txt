    "it is well known that proteins consist of amino acids whose number may vary in the range from hundreds up to tens of thousands .",
    "small fragments of proteins are usually called polypeptide chains or polypeptides .",
    "this work is devoted to a study of the conformational properties of glycine polypeptide chains .    since recently , it became possible to study experimentally small fragments of proteins and polypeptides in the gas phase with the use of the maldi mass spectroscopy @xcite and the esi mass spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "from theoretical view point , investigation of small polypeptides is of significant interest because they can be treated by means of _ ab initio _ methods allowing accurate comparison of theoretical predictions with experiment .",
    "the results of _ ab initio _ calculations can be then utilized for the development of model approaches applicable for the description of larger and more complex protein structures .",
    "polypeptides are characterized by the primary and the secondary structure @xcite .",
    "different geometrical configurations of a polypeptide are often called as the conformations .",
    "one can expect that chemical and physical properties of various conformations of complex molecules might differ significantly .",
    "the number of various conformations ( isomeric states ) grows rapidly with the growth of a system size .",
    "thus , a search for the most stable conformations becomes an increasingly difficult problem for large molecules . with the help of the nmr spectroscopy and the x - rays diffraction analysis",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that the sheet and the helix structures are the most prominent elements of the protein secondary structure .",
    "the main difference between the sheet and the helix structures is due to the difference of the dihedral angles formed by the atoms of the polypeptide chains in the two cases .",
    "these degrees of freedom are responsible for the transition of the molecule from one conformation to another . by increasing the temperature of the system , the degrees of freedom responsible for twisting of the polypeptide chain can be activated .",
    "the study of this transition and evaluation of its characteristic duration are of significant interest , because this problem is closely related to one of the most intriguing problems of the protein physics - the protein folding . to study this transition",
    "it is necessary to investigate the potential energy surface of amino acid chains with respect to their twisting .",
    "besides the protein folding , the potential energy landscapes of polypeptides carry a lot of detail and useful information about the structure of these molecules .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied the potential energy surface for small glycine chains .",
    "these molecules were chosen because they are often present in native proteins as fragments , and also because they allow _ ab initio _ theoretical treatment due to their relatively small size .",
    "previously , only glycine and alanine dipeptides were studied in detail .",
    "sometimes their analogues were used to reduce the computational costs ( for example ( s)-@xmath2-(formylamino)propanamide ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite alanine and glycine dipeptides were investigated within the hartree - fock theory . in these papers",
    "the potential energy surfaces were calculated versus the twisting angles of the molecules .",
    "different stable conformations of the dipeptides , corresponding to different molecular conformations , were determined .",
    "each stable conformation of the molecule was additionally studied on the basis of the perturbation theory , which takes into account many - electron correlations in the system . in refs .",
    "@xcite different conformations and their energies were determined within the framework of the density functional theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite dynamics of the alanine dipeptide analog was discussed and time of the transition between the two conformations of the alanine dipeptide was found . in @xcite",
    "the glycine molecule was studied with accounting for the many electron correlations within the many - body perturbation theory . in this work",
    "the most important glycine isomers and the frequencies of the normal vibration modes were determined .",
    "a number of papers were devoted to the study of tripeptides . in refs .",
    "@xcite dynamics of the alanine and glycine tripeptides was studied by means of classical molecular dynamics and with the use of semi - empirical potentials ( such as gromos , charmm and amber ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite within the framework of the hartree - fock theory several stable conformations of alanine and glycine tripeptides were found . in ref .",
    "@xcite the raman and ir spectra for alanine and glycine tripeptides were measured in neutral , acidy and alkali environments .",
    "polypeptides have been studied less .",
    "we are aware of only several related papers .",
    "in particular , stable conformations of neutral and charged alanine hexapeptides were obtained with the use of empirical potentials and discussed in ref .",
    "experimental nmr study of various conformations of alanine heptapeptides at different temperatures was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite with the use of empirical molecular dynamics based on monte - carlo methods , a polypeptide consisting of 21 amino acids was described .    in the present paper",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ calculation of the multidimensional potential energy surface for the glycine polypeptide chains consisting of three and six amino acids .",
    "the potential energy surface versus twisting degrees of freedom of the polypeptide chain has been calculated .",
    "the calculations have been performed within _ ab initio _ theoretical framework based on the density functional theory ( dft ) accounting for all the electrons in the system .",
    "previously , this kind of calculations were performed only for dipeptides ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for larger molecules ,",
    "only a few conformations were considered ( see citations above ) .",
    "we have calculated the energy barriers for the transitions between different molecular conformations and determined the energetically most favorable ones .",
    "using a thermodynamic approach , we have estimated times of the characteristic transitions between the most energetically favorable conformations .",
    "the results of our calculation have been compared with other theoretical simulations and with the available experimental data .",
    "we have also analysed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains influences the potential energy landscapes . in particular ,",
    "the role of the secondary structure in the formation of stable conformations of the chains of six amino acids being in the sheet and in the helix conformations has been elucidated .",
    "some preliminary results of our work were published as electronic preprints @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we give a brief overview of theoretical methods used in our work . in section [ results ] we present and discuss the results of our computations . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we draw a conclusion to this paper .",
    "the atomic system of units , @xmath3 , is used throughout the paper unless other units are indicated .",
    "in the present paper we study the multidimensional potential energy surfaces for glycine polypeptides within the framework of the density functional theory .",
    "the potential energy surfaces are multidimensional functions of atomic coordinates . in our work",
    "the potential energy surfaces were considered as a function of the dihedral angles formed by the atoms of the polypeptide chain . for this calculation the born - oppenheimer approximation allowing to separate the motion of the electronic and ionic subsystems is used .    the density functional theory ( dft )",
    "is a common tool for the calculation of properties of quantum many body systems in which many electron correlations play an important role . the dft formalism is well known and can be found in many textbooks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in our work we present only the basic equations and ideas of this method .",
    "electronic wave functions and energy levels within the framework of dft are obtained from the kohn - sham equations , which read as ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath4    where the first term represents the kinetic energy of the @xmath5-th electron with the wavefunction @xmath6 and the energy @xmath7 , @xmath8 describes the electron attraction to the ionic centers , @xmath9 is the hartree part of the interelectronic interaction @xcite , @xmath10 is the local exchange - correlation potential .",

    "however , no unique potential @xmath12 , universally applicable for different systems and conditions , has been found so far .",
    "approximate functionals employed by the dft usually partition the exchange - correlation energy into two parts , referred to as the _ exchange _ and the _ correlation _ terms :    @xmath13= e_x(\\rho)+e_c(\\rho ) \\label{ex_core}\\ ] ]    both terms are the functionals of the electron density , which can be of two distinctly different types : either a _ local _ functional depending only on the electron density @xmath14 or a _ gradient - corrected _ functionals depending on both @xmath14 and its gradient , @xmath15 .",
    "a variety of exchange correlation functionals can be found in literature . in our work",
    "we have used the hybrid becke - type three - parameter exchange functional @xcite paired with the gradient - corrected lee , yang and parr correlation functional ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the potential energy surfaces for the glycine polypeptide chains calculated versus dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 defined in figure [ angles_def ] . in particular , we focus on the chains consisting of three and six amino acids .",
    "and @xmath1 used to characterize the potential energy surface of the polypeptide chain . ]",
    "both angles are defined by the four neighboring atoms in the polypeptide chain .",
    "the angle @xmath17 is defined as the dihedral angle between the planes formed by the atoms ( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath6 is defined as the dihedral angle between ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath21 ) planes . beside the angles @xmath17 and @xmath6 there is an angle @xmath22 , which is defined as the dihedral angle between the ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath23 ) planes .",
    "the atoms are numbered from the @xmath24 terminal of the polypeptide .",
    "the angles @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 take all possible values within the interval [ @xmath25;@xmath26 . for the unambiguous definition",
    "we count the angles @xmath17 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 clockwise , if one looks on the molecule from its @xmath24 terminal ( see fig . [ angles_def ] ) .",
    "this way of angle counting is the most commonly used @xcite .",
    "the angles @xmath17 and @xmath6 can be defined for any amino acid in the chain except for the first and the last ones .",
    "below we omit the subscripts and consider angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the middle amino acid of the polypeptide .      in order to study the twisting of a polypeptide chain one needs first to define its initial structure .",
    "although the number of its conformations increases with the growth of the molecule size , there are certain types of polypeptide structure , namely the sheet and the helix conformations , which are the most typical . in the present paper",
    "we have investigated twisting of the polypeptide chains of the sheet and the helix conformation . by varying the angles @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 in the central amino acid one can create the structure of the polypeptide differing significantly from the pure sheet or helix conformations .",
    "if the structure of a polypeptide can be transformed to a helix or a sheet one by a trivial variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such polypeptides are referred below as belonging to the group of the helix or the sheet structure respectively .        in figure [ stable_geom ] we present the optimized geometries of glycine polypeptide chains that have been used for the exploration of the potential energy surfaces .",
    "all geometries have been optimized with the use of the b3lyp functional .",
    "figure [ stable_geom]a shows the glycine tripeptide structure . in the present work we choose in the sheet conformation , because the tripeptide is too short to form the helix conformation . figures [ stable_geom]b and [ stable_geom]c show glycine hexapeptide in the sheet and the helix conformations respectively .",
    "the total energies ( in atomic units ) of the molecules are given below the images .          ) .",
    "below each image we present angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which have been obtained with accounting for relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "values in brackets give the angles calculated without accounting for relaxation . above each image ,",
    "the energy of the corresponding conformation is given in ev .",
    "the energies are counted from the energy of conformation 1 ( the energy of conformation 1 is given in a.u . ) .",
    "values in brackets give the energies obtained without accounting for the relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "dashed lines show the strongest hydrogen bonds .",
    "their lengths are given in angstroms . ]    in figure [ map_gly3 ] we present the potential energy surface for the glycine tripeptide calculated by the b3lyp/6 - 31g(2d , p ) method .",
    "the energy scale is given in ev , kcal / mol and kelvin .",
    "energies on the plot are measured from the lowest energy minimum of the potential energy surface .    from the figure",
    "follows that there are several minima on the potential energy surface .",
    "they are numbered according to the value of the corresponding energy value .",
    "each minimum corresponds to a certain conformation of the molecule .",
    "these conformations differ significantly from each other . in the case of glycine tripeptide",
    "there are only three conformations , shown in figure [ geom_gly3 ] .",
    "dashed lines show the strongest hydrogen bonds in the system , which arise when the distance between hydrogen and oxygen atoms becomes less then 2.9 angstroms .    to calculate the potential energy surface the following procedure was adopted .",
    "once the stable structure of the molecule has been determined and optimized , all but two ( these are the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the central amino acid ) degrees of freedom were frozen .",
    "then the energy of the molecule was calculated by varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure was used to calculate all potential energy surfaces presented below in this section .",
    "it allows one to find efficiently the minima on the potential energy surface and to determine the main stable conformations of the molecule .",
    "the absolute energy values of different conformations of the tripeptide found by this method are not too accurate , because the method does not account for the relaxation of other degrees of freedom in the system . to calculate the potential energy surface with accounting for the relaxation one needs 20 - 30 times more of the computer time .",
    "therefore , a systematic calculations with accounting for the relaxation have not been performed in our work .",
    "instead , we have performed a complete optimization of the molecular conformations , corresponding to all minima on the calculated potential energy surface .    in figure [ geom_gly3 ]",
    "we compare stable conformations of the glycine tripeptide calculated with and without accounting for the relaxation of all atoms in the system . as it is seen from this figure the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 differ by about 10 percent in the two cases .",
    "this difference arises due to the coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with other degrees of freedom .",
    "note the change of the sign of the relative energies of some conformations .",
    "this effect is due to the rearrangement of side atoms ( radicals ) in the polypeptide chain which lowers the energies of different conformations differently .    in our work",
    "the potential energy surface has been calculated and interpolated on the grid with the step of @xmath27 .",
    "this step size is an optimal one , because the interpolation error is about @xmath28 , i.e. comparable with the angle deviations caused by the relaxation of all degrees of freedom in the system .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that not all of the structures listed above are present equally in proteins . in figure",
    "[ gly_experiment]a we show the distribution of the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 of glycine residues in protein structures selected from the brookhaven protein data bank @xcite .",
    "it is possible to distinguish four main regions , in which most of the experimental points are located . in figure [ gly_experiment ] these regions",
    "are schematically shown with dashed ellipses .",
    "note that these ellipses are used for illustrative purposes only , and serve for a better understanding of the experimental data .",
    "the regions in which most of the observed angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are located correspond to different secondary structure of the poly - glycine .",
    "thus , region i corresponds to the parallel and antiparallel @xmath29sheets .",
    "region ii corresponds to the right - handed @xmath30 helix .",
    "region iii corresponds to the right - handed @xmath31helix , right - handed @xmath32 helix , right - handed @xmath33helix and @xmath29turn of type i. region iv corresponds to the left - handed @xmath34helix , left - handed @xmath35 helix and @xmath29turn of type ii . in some cases there",
    "are several types of secondary structure within one domain . in the present work",
    "we have not studied the secondary structure of proteins systematically enough to establish the univocal correspondence of the observed experimental points to different types of the secondary structure .",
    "figure [ gly_experiment]a demonstrates that @xmath36 and @xmath37 helixes are rarely observed in experiment .",
    "note that some experimental points lie in the forbidden region of the steric ramachandran diagram ( see region iv in fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]a ) .",
    "the quantum calculation shows that in fact this region is allowed and has several minima on the potential energy surface ( see fig [ gly_experiment]c and [ gly_experiment]d ) .",
    "this comparison shows that for an accurate description of polypeptides it is important to take quantum properties of these systems into account .",
    "let us now compare the distribution of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimentally observed for proteins with the potential energy landscape calculated for glycine polypeptides , and establish correspondence of the secondary structure of the calculated conformations with the predictions of the simple ramachandran model .",
    "region i corresponds to the minima 2 , 1 and 5 on the potential energy surfaces of the glycine tripeptide ( fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]b ) , the glycine hexpeptide with the secondary structure of sheet ( fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]c ) , and the glycine hexapeptide with the secondary structure of helix ( fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]d ) respectively .",
    "conformations 2 and 1 in figures [ gly_experiment]b and [ gly_experiment]c correspond exactly to the glycine chains in the @xmath38-sheet conformation ( see fig .",
    "[ geom_gly3 ] and [ gly6]a ) .",
    "conformation 5 in figure [ gly_experiment]d is a mixed state . here",
    "the central amino acid has the conformation of sheet , while the outermost amino acids have the conformation of helix .",
    "region ii corresponds to the minima 3 , 2 and 1 on the potential energy surfaces [ gly_experiment]b , [ gly_experiment]c , and [ gly_experiment]d , respectively . on the steric diagram for poly - glycine ( see fig . [ gly_experiment]a ) this region corresponds to the right - handed @xmath30 helix .",
    "the structure of conformations 3 and 2 on the surfaces [ gly_experiment]b and [ gly_experiment]c differs from the structure of this particular helix type .",
    "only the central glycines , for which the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figures [ gly_experiment]b and [ gly_experiment]c are defined , have the structure of @xmath30 helix .",
    "thus , one can refer to conformations 3 and 2 as to the mixed states , where the central part of the polypeptide chain has the conformation of helix and the outermost parts have the conformation of sheet .",
    "conformation 1 on the surface [ gly_experiment]d is also a mixed state . here",
    "one can distinguish one turn of @xmath32 helix and two turns of @xmath30 helix ( see fig .",
    "[ gly6]b ) .",
    "region iii corresponds to the structure of right - handed @xmath31helix , right - handed @xmath32 helix , right - handed @xmath33helix and @xmath29turn i. it corresponds to minimum 5 on the potential energy surface of the glycine hexapeptide with the secondary structure of sheet [ gly_experiment]c .",
    "conformation 5 can be characterized as partially formed @xmath29turn , because the glycine , for which the dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure ( fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]c ) are defined , has the geometry of @xmath29turn and its neighbor forms a @xmath29sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ gly6]a ) .",
    "there are no minima in region iii on the potential energy surfaces presented in figures [ gly_experiment]b and [ gly_experiment]d .",
    "this happens because in this case most probable is the structure of right - handed @xmath31helix .",
    "to form one turn of the helix of this type it is necessary to link at least four amino acids , so the glycine tripeptide is too short for that . as well , six amino acids chain is too short to form a stable fragment of an @xmath31helix , because it does not have enough hydrogen bonds to stabilize the structure . for the hexapeptide",
    "more probable are the elements of @xmath32 and @xmath39 helixes , because in these cases 2 and 3 helical turns respectively can be formed .",
    "region iv is represented by the structure of left - handed @xmath34helix , left - handed @xmath35 helix and @xmath29turn of type ii . to form these structures",
    "it is necessary to have at least four amino acids , therefore there is no minima in this region on the potential energy surface of glycine tripeptide ( fig .",
    "[ gly_experiment]b ) .",
    "region iv corresponds to the conformations 4 and 3 on the surfaces [ gly_experiment]c and [ gly_experiment]d respectively .",
    "conformation 4 on the surface [ gly_experiment]c corresponds to partially formed @xmath29turn , because the glycine , for which the dihedral angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ gly_experiment]c are plotted has the configuration of @xmath29turn , but the neighboring aminoacid in the chain forms a @xmath29sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ gly6]a ) .",
    "conformation 3 on the surface [ gly_experiment]d can be characterized as deformed turn of left - handed @xmath34helix , which turns out to be energetically the most favorable in this region of the potential energy surface ( see fig .",
    "[ gly6]b ) .    finally , we mention a few peculiarities of the calculated potential energy landscapes . at each of the potential energy surfaces discussed in this work one can see a minimum at @xmath40 and @xmath41 . on the steric diagram for poly - glycine this region corresponds to the left - handed @xmath42 helix .",
    "conformations 1 , 3 and 2 on the potential energy surfaces [ gly_experiment]b , [ gly_experiment]c , and [ gly_experiment]d respectively partially represent this structure ( see fig .",
    "[ geom_gly3 ] , [ gly6]a and [ gly6]b ) .",
    "the structure of conformation 4 on the potential energy surface [ gly_experiment]d is similar to left - handed @xmath34helix , but differs from it due to the short length of the polypeptide chain , resulting in significant variation of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in all the residues along the chain .",
    "in the present paper the multidimensional potential energy surfaces for amino acid chains consisting of three and six glycines has been investigated and the conformational properties of these systems with respect to the twisting of the polypeptide chain have been described .",
    "the calculations were carried out within _ ab initio _ theoretical framework based on the density functional theory accounting for all the electrons in the system .",
    "we have determined stable conformations and calculated the energy barriers for transitions between them . using a thermodynamic approach ,",
    "we have estimated times of the characteristic transitions between the conformations .",
    "it was demonstrated that the transition times lie within the picosecond region .",
    "our estimates are compared with the available molecular - dynamics simulations results , and the correspondence between the results of the two different methods is reported . a strong barrier asymmetry between neighboring stable conformations on the potential energy surface",
    "was found .",
    "we have compared for the first time values of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 for glycine residues experimentally observed in real proteins with the coordinates of minima on the potential energy surfaces .",
    "this comparison has showed that all profound minima on the potential energy surfaces correspond to the regions in which experimentally measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are located .",
    "we have also analysed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains influences the formation of the potential energy landscapes . for the chains of six amino acids with the secondary structures of sheet and helix the influence of the secondary structure on the stable conformations of the molecule",
