    "axially symmetric solutions of the einstein equations corresponding to thin disks of matter are rather common in the physical literature",
    ". they can be static or stationary , with or without radial pressure , accommodate heat flow , electric charge , and halos , among many other possibilities , see , for instance @xcite .",
    "many of the known thin disk solutions can be obtained by using the so - called `` displace , cut and reflect '' ( dcr ) method , originally due to kuzmin @xcite , which , in fact , has newtonian origin and will be briefly presented in the next section .",
    "matter disks in the presence of magnetic fields are particularly relevant due to the abundance of possible astrophysical applications for these models , and there are indeed some previous examples of these solutions in the literature @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we will show how to adapt the standard dcr method to generate consistent solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations corresponding to thin disks of matter with magnetic fields entirely supported by polar surface currents on the disk , a situation clearly mimicking realistic astrophysical thin plasma disks @xcite .",
    "our starting point will be the gutsunaev - manko two - parameter family of solutions describing massive axisymetric objects endowed with a magnetic dipole moment in general relativity @xcite .",
    "in contrast with other solutions with magnetic fields , as for instance the well known one due to bonnor @xcite , for the gutsunaev - manko family , the object mass and dipole magnetic moment are really independent quantities and , hence , we are able to generate a continuous three - parameter family of magnetized disks with finite total mass and energy .",
    "the three parameters can determine univocally , for instance , the disk total mass , dipole magnetic moment , and central superficial density .",
    "such parameters can be chosen to achieve some desired physical properties , with special emphasis , of course , to the stability of the solution .",
    "for the stability analysis of the disk , we consider , besides the usual generalized radial rayleigh criteria@xcite , also the vertical stability ( oblique orbits)@xcite .",
    "we show that one indeed has a large continuous family of magnetized disks satisfying these stability criteria , which could be useful , in principle , for the study of the abundant astrophysical situations involving disks of matter and magnetic fields .",
    "our magnetized disks have only azimuthal pressure , and hence they can be interpreted physically as composed by counter - rotating particles , see , for instance , @xcite for further references on this rather common hypothesis for static disks configurations in general relativity .",
    "incidentally , we notice that there are indeed some recent observational evidences for counter - rotating stellar disk , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ disks ] provides an overview of the dcr method and its necessary adaptation to generate viable magnetized disks . for sake of completeness",
    ", we also review briefly the main pertinent results about the stability of thin disks .",
    "section iii is devoted to construct and discuss the stability of the new solutions , and the last section is left for some concluding remarks about the stability of our disks .",
    "the kuzmin `` displace , cut and reflect '' ( dcr ) method @xcite can be used to generate rather generic thin disk configurations starting from a given solution of einstein ( or even laplace ) equations .",
    "considering , for instance , a point - source solution , we can divide this method accordingly to the following steps : first we choose a hypersurface ( @xmath0 in cylindrical coordinates , in our case , see fig .",
    "[ cdr ] )        separating the spacetime in two regions , with one of them containing the source of the gravitational field .",
    "second , we discard the part that contains the source and , third , use the hypersurface @xmath0 to reflect the remaining part .",
    "the result of the application of this procedure will be generically a regular spacetime with a surface singularity or , in other words , a solution of einstein equations with an infinite thin disk of matter located at @xmath0 . despite of being infinite , in many cases , as in the present one ,",
    "these disks have finite total mass and energy and , hence , they might be considered as approximations to some finite size disks .",
    "the dcr procedure is fully equivalent to make the following mathematical transformation @xcite @xmath1 for all the pertinent quantities , where the disk plane now will be given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a free parameter .",
    "such a method can be applied virtually to any gravitational solution , relativistic or newtonian , resulting generically in gravitational fields supported by surface distributions of matter , see @xcite for further references .",
    "we are mainly interested here in axisymmetric static solutions of the einstein equations , and these solutions can be conveniently described in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 as @xmath5 the application of ( [ dcr ] ) gives origin generically to functions of class @xmath6 across the disk plane . using the standard notation @xmath7 = \\left.f\\right|_{z=0^+ } - \\left.f\\right|_{z=0 ^ -}$ ] for the discontinuities across the hypersurface @xmath2 , one has @xmath8 = 0 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath9 derivative of the metric tensor is typically discontinuous at @xmath2 , and the quantities @xmath10 = b_{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] will determine all the physical and geometrical properties of the disk . in particular , the christofel symbols and the riemann curvature tensor @xmath11 can be define by means of distributions involving ( [ derivada_descontinuidade ] ) , leading to @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the covariant dirac @xmath14-function @xcite , @xmath15 is the ( smooth ) riemann curvature tensor for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 from the contractions of ( [ h ] ) , one can calculate directly the disk energy momentum tensor @xmath18 , which will be given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "one finally has @xcite @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is diagonal for metrics of the type ( [ geral ] ) .",
    "its components correspond the surface energy density and the pressures in the radial , axial , and azimuthal directions , respectively , @xmath23 moreover , is clear from ( [ qab ] ) that @xmath24 for our case , as one would indeed naturally expect for infinitesimally thin disks . assuming the system to be symmetric under reflections @xmath25",
    ", one can calculate @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for static axisymmetric spacetimes with metric ( [ geral ] ) , leading to @xcite @xmath29 where the notation @xmath30 means that the derivative is calculated after the substitution ( [ cdr ] ) .",
    "we are now in conditions to formulate the stability criteria we will use for the disk .",
    "however , before starting the stability discussion , it is important to stress that the use of ( [ cdr ] ) alone is not enough to generate viable magnetized disks .",
    "the problem is that in the same way the dcr method induces a superficial density of matter at @xmath2 , it will generically do with a superficial density of magnetic monopoles on the disk @xcite , jeopardizing any possible realistic physical application for these solutions . fortunately , this can be easily fixed .",
    "suppose we have a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations of the form ( [ geral ] ) with a magnetic field given by the electromagnetic quadri - potential @xmath31.\\ ] ] the linearity of the maxwell equations and the quadratic structure of the maxwell energy - momentum tensor imply that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations for the same metric tensor ( [ geral ] ) .",
    "one can avoid the appearance of magnetic monopoles on the disk if we combine ( [ cdr ] ) with the transformation @xmath34 by using ( [ cdr ] ) and ( [ cdr1 ] ) , we will be able to generate disks of matter with dipole magnetic fields entirely supported by surface polar currents on the disk .",
    "since the metric tensor is invariant under ( [ cdr1 ] ) , the stability analysis , based solely in the energy - momentum tensor of the disk , is not affected by this transformation . on the other hand , ( [ cdr1 ] )",
    "is crucial to obtain the polar currents which indeed generate the disk magnetization .",
    "as we will see , the matter content of our disks has no radial pressure , and in this case the disk is usually viewed as being composed from counter - rotating identical particles , which guarantees , besides the vanishing of the radial pressure , a vanishing total angular momentum for the disk , despite the rotation of its matter content , see @xcite for further details and references .",
    "we will perform two stability tests for our solutions : radial and vertical perturbations .",
    "in fact , they consisting in the ( linear ) stability analysis of the circular orbits at @xmath2 against small perturbations , and both can be derived from the geodesic motion on the disk plane and around its vicinity . since",
    "( [ geral ] ) is static and axisymmetric , its geodesic equations will have two independent constants of motion : the total energy @xmath35 and the angular momentum around the @xmath9 direction @xmath36 .",
    "the ( reduced ) hamiltonian for the geodesics of the metric ( [ geral ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath37 where the effective potential @xmath38 will be crucial for both stability tests .",
    "a pertinent and rather deep question is if this kind of stability analysis of the circular geodesics in the disk plane would be enough to guarantee the disk stability beyond the counter - rotating hypothesis .",
    "a full answer to this question is obviously out of scope of the present paper , but we will return to this point in the last section .",
    "the rayleigh criterion establishes the requirements for the circular orbits on the disk be stable against radial perturbations .",
    "its relativistic version has been intensively studied in recent years , see @xcite .",
    "essentially , it can be deduced from the behavior of circular planar solutions of ( [ ham ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the solutions with @xmath39 and , consequently , @xmath40 constant , which , of course , occurs for @xmath41 .",
    "the stability of such circular orbits requires @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is evaluated at @xmath2 .",
    "as one can see , the disk radial stability requires that both @xmath45 and @xmath46 be monotonically increasing functions of @xmath43 on the disk plane @xmath2 .",
    "the situation for @xmath46 is clearly analogous to the newtonian case @xcite , while the requirement of @xmath47 has , in fact , no newtonian counterpart @xcite .",
    "since the dynamics of the geodesics are in fact singular at @xmath2 , the stability of the oblique orbits will be determined solely by the `` restoring '' vertical force @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the metric ( [ geral ] ) , the condition @xmath49   > 0,\\ ] ] evaluated on the plane @xmath2 , is enough to guarantee the vertical stability of circular orbits in our disks .",
    "the gutsunaev - manko spacetimes @xcite form a large family of asymptotically flat , axisymmetric , and stationary solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we are mainly interested here in one of their simplest sub - cases , the continuous two - parameter family corresponding to the gravitational field of massive magnetic dipoles @xcite .",
    "it can be conveniently written , using the cylindrical coordinates ( [ geral ] ) , in the weyl line element form , for which @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a dimensionless constant , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the usual prolate coordinates , related to the cylindrical coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath9 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a dimensional constant . the dipole magnetic field , which has the form ( [ quadri ] ) , is given by @xmath59 in order to interpret the physical role of the two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath54",
    ", one can cast the metric in spherical coordinates and analyze the asymptotically flat limit @xcite , leading to the conclusion that these parameters are related to the mass @xmath60 and magnetic dipole @xmath61 of the central object by the expressions @xmath62 the only restrictions on these parameters in order to have physically meaningful solutions , for our purposes , are @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the schwarzschild case is recovered for @xmath65 , and the solution can accommodate any values for the mass @xmath60 and the dipole magnetic moment @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 is given by @xmath66 from where it is clear that with @xmath67 one can effectively cover all possibilities for @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 is clearly dimensionless , @xmath58 is the only massive parameter for these solutions .",
    "all the dimensional quantities in our analysis will be always expressed in units of @xmath58 .",
    "the gutsunaev - manko solutions are asymptotically flat , and such a crucial property will be inherited by our disks .",
    "the magnetized disks are generated by doing the transformation ( [ cdr ] ) and simultaneously @xmath68 , which implements ( [ cdr1 ] ) , in all pertinent expressions , giving origin to a three - parameter @xmath69 family of disk solutions for the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to configurations such that @xmath70 in order to avoid the rather intricate causal structure of the gutsunaev - manko solution near its center , otherwise it would be impossible to have stable disk configurations .",
    "we will return to this point in the last section . despite all pertinent expressions here",
    "involve essentially only rational functions and , hence , all the calculations can be straightforwardly carried out , the resulting expressions are quite cumbersome , and so we opt to present our results graphically .",
    "nevertheless , the explicit expressions for the gutsunaev - manko solutions allow some useful simplifications .",
    "in particular , since @xmath71 , see ( [ gs1 ] ) , one gets from ( [ pr ] ) that , as we have already advanced , @xmath72 , reducing the vertical stability criterion to @xmath73 at @xmath2 , or , in other words , the disk must obey the null energy condition to assure the stability of vertical perturbations ( oblique orbits ) .",
    "hence , we will guarantee both the radial and vertical stabilities if , for @xmath2 , @xmath74 is a positive function , and @xmath45 and @xmath75 are monotonically increasing in @xmath43 , see ( [ ray ] ) .",

    "we will see that the magnetic fields are supported entirely by surface polar currents on the disk plane .",
    "notice that for the electromagnetic quadripotential ( [ quadri ] ) , the nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic tensor are @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "<S> we adapt the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method to construct exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations corresponding to infinitesimally thin disks of matter endowed with dipole magnetic fields , which are entirely supported by surface polar currents on the disk . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the gutsunaev - manko axisymmetric solution describing massive magnetic dipoles in general relativity , from which we obtain a continuous three - parameter family of asymptotically flat static magnetized disks with finite mass and energy . for strong magnetic fields , </S>",
    "<S> the disk surface density profile resembles some well known self - gravitating ring - like structures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that many of these solutions can be indeed stable and , hence , they could be in principle useful for the study of the abundant astrophysical situations involving disks of matter and magnetic fields . </S>"
