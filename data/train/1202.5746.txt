    "the excited molecular gas in the centers of seyfert galaxies offers a sensitive probe of the nature of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "observational studies of the most highly excited material in seyfert nuclei have typically used the h@xmath17 rotational  @xcite and the well - studied ro - vibrational  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) transitions . the pure h@xmath17 rotational lines ( @xmath23 k )",
    "are easily thermalized at moderate ( @xmath24 @xmath7 ) densities , while the ro - vibrational lines ( @xmath25 k ) may be excited through collisions in dense ( @xmath26 @xmath7 ) gas or through uv fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "observations of these tracers in seyferts have identified a number of potentially important excitation mechanisms , including x - rays from the agn  @xcite , shocks associated with supernova remnants , radio jets , and gravitational instabilities  @xcite , and stellar far - uv ( fuv ) radiation  @xcite , with no clear consensus on a single dominant excitation source .",
    "the far - ir ( fir ) co rotational transitions ( co[@xmath27 , with @xmath28 ) arise from states @xmath29 k above ground and have critical densities of @xmath30 @xmath7 , and complement the h@xmath17 transitions for studies of warm and dense material .",
    "compared with h@xmath17 , the fir co lines trace similar energy levels , but have higher critical densities , and are less sensitive to extinction . additionally , the smaller energy gaps between levels leads to a finer sampling of density - temperature phase space .",
    "these lines have been proposed as potential tools for studying the obscuring medium of type 2 agn  @xcite , determining the energy budgets of composite starburst / agn systems  @xcite , and identifying accreting black holes in the early universe  @xcite , but previous facilities were unable to detect this line emission from extragalactic sources . here",
    "we take advantage of the superb sensitivity of herschel - pacs to conduct the first extragalactic study of fir co emission , from the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 .",
    "ngc 1068 is one of the brightest and best studied seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the paradigm of an optically and geometrically thick molecular torus accounting for the seyfert type 1 and 2 dichotomy followed the detection of scattered broad line emission from this source  @xcite , and ngc 1068 has been at the center of subsequent studies of the ism in seyfert nuclei .",
    "the molecular gas in the central 1@xmath31 of ngc 1068 has been well studied , and here we review some of the key results .",
    "interferometric observations of co(1 - 0 ) have identified a pair of @xmath32@xmath33 ( @xmath32@xmath34 kpc ) radius spiral arms  @xcite , which may be modeled as forming in response to a @xmath32@xmath35 kpc bar  @xcite .",
    "these arms are bright in br@xmath36  @xcite , pah emission  @xcite , and submillimeter continuum  @xcite , and contain most of the star formation in the central region .",
    "centered on the agn is the @xmath3@xmath37 ( @xmath3@xmath38 pc ) circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) , which is visible in co and h@xmath17 1 - 0 s(1 ) , but becomes particularly prominent in images of hcn  @xcite and other high density tracers  @xcite .",
    "strong emission in co(4 - 3 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) indicate the gas in the cnd is both warm and dense  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although see   for a lower density model ) .",
    "the high abundances of hcn , cn , h@xmath39o@xmath40 , and other molecules in the cnd suggest an x - ray@xmath41driven chemistry  @xcite , and x - ray heating has also been invoked to explain the strong h@xmath17 1 - 0 s(1 ) and [ fe ii ] emission  @xcite . at @xmath3@xmath42 resolution the h@xmath17 1 - 0 s(1 ) observations resolve the cnd into a @xmath3@xmath43 ring - like structure  @xcite , while the line spectral profiles show evidence for rotation , expansion , and more complex kinematics  @xcite .",
    "shocks following this non - circular motion , and possibly associated with jet - ism interactions , may also be important in heating the molecular cnd  @xcite . at @xmath3@xmath44 resolution the h@xmath17 1 - 0 s(1 ) images reveal two clumps of infalling molecular material at @xmath3@xmath45 scales that likely play an important role in both fueling and obscuring the agn , with an estimated infall rate of @xmath3@xmath46 @xmath10yr@xmath5 to within a few parsecs of the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "finally , milli - arcsec resolution radio observations identify a series of h@xmath17o maser spots that trace out the inner surface of a @xmath3@xmath47 pc radius molecular disk , centered on the agn  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hard x - ray observations of ngc 1068 indicate large obscuration to the nucleus  @xcite by an intervening medium with a column density possibly exceeding @xmath48 @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "interferometric mid - ir observations of ngc 1068 identify a parsec scale structure of hot dust that , along with the h@xmath17o maser disk , may represent the dusty molecular torus responsible for the x - ray obscuration  @xcite .",
    "however , other investigators have found evidence that at least some of the nuclear obscuration occurs on few to ten parsec scales from the agn  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ observationssection ]",
    "we describe the herschel - pacs observations of the fir co lines in ngc 1068 . in section  [ resultssection ]",
    "we analyze the gas excitation and estimate physical parameters , and in section  [ comparisonsection ] we compare the physical parameters and line profiles with those of other molecular gas tracers . in sections  [ meheating ] and  [ heheating ] we discuss potential heating mechanisms . in section  [ nondetections ]",
    "we discuss our detections and upper limits in the context of the molecular ism within a few parsecs of the agn , and in section  [ conclusions ] we summarize our findings . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance to ngc 1068 of 14.4 mpc  @xcite , and a systemic velocity @xmath49 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the observations were made with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer  ( pacs ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ herschel _ space observatory  @xcite .",
    "most of the data presented here was obtained as part of the shining guaranteed time key program .",
    "the shining observations consisted of ten high resolution range scans concatenated to cover the @xmath50 @xmath51 m and @xmath52 @xmath51 m ranges , as well as deeper integrations of co(17 - 16 ) , co(24 - 23 ) , and co(40 - 39 ) .",
    "these latter observations targeted co transitions falling in relatively clean spectral regions , and were conducted to provide a coarse but sensitive sampling of the co sed over the full fir range .",
    "the shining data yielded detections of most transitions at @xmath53 , and we obtained follow - up observations of co(28 - 27 ) and co(30 - 29 ) in an open time project to extend our co sed measurements to higher-@xmath15 .",
    "these observations amounted to a total of 13.7 hours of integration time .",
    "the data reduction was done using the standard pacs reduction and calibration pipeline ( ipipe ) included in hipe 5.0 975 .",
    "however , for the final calibration we normalized the spectra to the telescope flux and recalibrated it with a reference telescope spectrum obtained from dedicated neptune continuum observations . with this approach",
    "we estimate an absolute flux calibraton accuracy of 30% .",
    "the pacs spectrometer performs integral field spectroscopy over a @xmath54 fov , resolved into a @xmath55 array of @xmath56 spatial pixels ( spaxels ) . the spectrometer resolving power varies from @xmath57 for the 1@xmath58 and 2@xmath59 order observations utilized here . in figure  [ spectra ]",
    "we show the spectra from the central spaxel centered on 11 of the 12 co transitions falling in the @xmath52 @xmath51 m range .",
    "the co(25 - 24 ) line at @xmath60 @xmath51 m lies in a noisy region at the edge of this range , and is not included .",
    "most of these lines are strong in the central spaxel , but little flux is detected outside of the central spaxel , as expected for an unresolved source ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "all fluxes and upper limits presented here were therefore extracted from the central spaxel , and referenced to a point source by dividing by the recommended point source correction factors  @xcite .",
    "the co line fluxes were measured by fitting the spectra with a gaussian profile plus a baseline . in most cases a linear baseline was adopted and the three parameters defining the gaussian were allowed to vary freely , but some lines required a modified approach .",
    "a broad feature underneath the co(15 - 14 ) line is present in the raw data , likely due to an imperfect subtraction of the telescope background , and we remove this feature using a higher order baseline fit . the integrated co(15 - 14 )",
    "flux and the residual line profile shown in figure  [ spectra ] are consistent with those of adjacent transitions , and we estimate that the flux uncertainty introduced by this baseline feature is less than the assumed 30% absolute flux calibration error .",
    "the co(16 - 15 ) line is blended with the 163 @xmath51 m oh doublet , and co(17 - 16 ) with a pair of flanking oh@xmath40 lines . in both cases",
    "we estimate the co flux by simultaneously fitting all features .",
    "an unconstrained gaussian fit to the relatively low s / n co(22 - 21 ) line yields a much broader profile than for any other transition , so here we fix the width of the co profile to the typical value derived from other line fits ( corresponding to an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath62 kms@xmath5 ; see figures  [ cosedlvg ] and  [ velcentroid ] , and the discussion in section  [ pacslinekinematics ] ) .",
    "co(23 - 22 ) is blended with a strong h@xmath17o line with a rest wavelength 209 kms@xmath5 to the red .",
    "if the combined feature were attributed solely to h@xmath17o it would be both broader and more blueshifted than any of the other 6 h@xmath17o lines detected in the pacs scans , and we interpret this as evidence for significant contamination by co(23 - 22 ) .",
    "a comparison with the average of the co(22 - 21 ) and co(24 - 23 ) profiles suggests the co(23 - 22 ) line is weaker and/or more redshifted than these lines ( figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties involved in deconvolving the co and h@xmath17o lines , we simply exclude co(23 - 22 ) from our analysis . all other transitions from co(14 - 13 ) through co(24 - 23 ) are well detected ( table  [ fluxtable ] ) .",
    "the @xmath50 @xmath51 m range includes the co(27 - 26 ) through co(50 - 49 ) transitions .",
    "none of these lines are detected in the full range scans or the targeted co(40 - 39 ) observation obtained with shining , but our follow - up open time program yielded a detection of co(30 - 29 ) ( figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the flux for this line was estimated using the same fitting procedure as described above for the @xmath53 lines ( table  [ fluxtable ] ) .",
    "we estimate upper limits for the nondetected transitions by first binning the data to @xmath63 kms@xmath5 bins , and then estimating the @xmath64 noise levels ( table  [ fluxtable ] ) .",
    "we detect no emission from @xmath65co .",
    "the @xmath65co(14 - 13 ) transition at @xmath66 @xmath51 m lies at the noisy edge of a scan , while the @xmath67 transitions at @xmath68 @xmath51 m are blended with @xmath69co lines . for @xmath65co(15 - 14 ) through @xmath65co(20 - 19 ) we estimate @xmath64 upper limits of @xmath70 wm@xmath71 , for a @xmath63 kms@xmath5 bin size .",
    "our most stringent lower limit on the @xmath69co/@xmath65co flux ratio comes from the @xmath72 transition , for which we estimate @xmath69co(16 - 15)/@xmath65co(16 - 15 ) @xmath73 . assuming the @xmath69co and @xmath65co seds are similar",

    "the @xmath301 kms@xmath5 offset between the he lines and the other molecular tracers in figure  [ velcentroid ] is @xmath302@xmath303 of the pacs spectral resolution , and at this level instrumental effects must be considered .",
    "the pacs spectral response depends on the illumination of the slit , such that a physical translation of a source on the sky in the dispersion direction will produce a wavelength shift in the spectral profile  @xcite . in the top panel of figure  [ velcentroid ]",
    "we show the equivalent velocity shift resulting from moving a point source @xmath304 from the center of the slit .",
    "a comparison with the co velocities shows that a @xmath3@xmath305 offset between the centers of the slit and the he co emission could be partially responsible for the measured wavelength shifts . with the exception of co(17 - 16 ) , co(24 - 23 ) , and co(30 - 29 ) , each point in figure  [ velcentroid ] corresponds to a line measured in the same set of concatenated range scans .",
    "therefore if all of the molecular emission is presumed to arise from the same region on the sky , a wavelength shift in the he co lines induced by a pointing offset should be matched by a comparable shift in the @xmath306 @xmath51 m oh and h@xmath17o lines , and this is not observed .",
    "alternatively , the he co lines may be modeled as arising from a region centered @xmath3@xmath305 away from the source of the oh and h@xmath17o emission .",
    "however , the co(30 - 29 ) line at @xmath307 @xmath51 m was observed separately from the series of concatenated scans , with a slit position angle differing by @xmath32@xmath308 . any pointing - induced shift to the co(30 - 29 ) line",
    "should then have a comparable magnitude but be in the opposite direction of the shifts in the other he co lines , and this is also not the case .",
    "we therefore argue that the observed wavelength shift represents a real velocity offset , with instrumental effects playing no more than a minor role .      to search for kinematic substructure in the cnd that might explain the velocity shifts among the fir co lines , we compare the fir line profiles with those of high resolution observations of co(2 - 1 )  @xcite and h@xmath17 1 - 0 s(1 )  @xcite .",

    "the smoothed h@xmath17 profile in panel f is inconsistent with either the me or he composite spectrum , and we conclude that this region of the cnd does not dominate the pacs co emission . in sections  [ meheating ] and  [ heheating ] we discuss possible excitation mechanisms for the fir co , including shock heating .",
    "the fact that we can rule out an origin in the region of the h@xmath17 ring with the best evidence for molecular gas perturbed by the jet leads us to suggest that such jet - driven shocks in the h@xmath17 ring do not excite the high-@xmath15 co.    aside from the bright h@xmath17 knot in the north , the me profile is generally consistent with much of the rest of the h@xmath17 ring .",
    "the best fit is with the profile of the strong h@xmath17 emission from the east .",
    "the profiles from the nw and sw are moderately red and blueshifted with respect to the me composite , but a combination of these regions , and indeed of the h@xmath17 emission integrated over the entire cnd ( excluding the northern knot ) , would also generate a reasonable fit .",

    "the oh@xmath40 and h@xmath17o@xmath40 emission detected in our pacs scans offers further evidence  @xcite , and will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "if the nuclear x - rays are responsible for the anomalous molecular abundances in the cnd , it is likely they also play an important role in the energetics .",
    "the he co emission arises from a small mass ( @xmath419 @xmath10 ) of warm ( @xmath420 k ) and dense ( @xmath421 @xmath7 ) material that represents only a minor fraction ( @xmath422 ) of the total gas in the cnd .",
    "the kinematic analysis presented in section  [ linekinematics ] suggests that this component may potentially be associated with the most blueshifted emission in the east or west of the h@xmath17 ring , or with the clump of infalling gas @xmath3@xmath327 north of the agn .",
    "here we consider potential heating mechanisms , and argue that the he co emission arises from either x - ray - heated gas in the northern streamer , or shock - heated material in either the northern streamer or h@xmath17 ring .",

    "the most straightforward way of generating a higher x - ray intensity is to attribute the he emission to the northern streamer . in projection ,",

    "we therefore argue that if x - ray heating accounts for both the me and he components , the he component is most plausibly associated with this infalling gas .      using the  @xcite pdr models we find that for a proper choice of high density ( @xmath433 @xmath7 ) and strong fuv field ( @xmath434 ) , the models reproduce the @xmath435 lines while underpredicting the lower-@xmath15 fluxes .",

    "thus we may consider a scenario in which the me co emission arises from x - ray or shock - heated gas in the h@xmath17 ring , while the bulk of the he emission originates in a trace amount of pdr material that makes only a minor contribution to the total continuum emission .",
    "these pdr models all fail to reproduce the co(30 - 29 ) transition , however , which in this scenario must therefore arise from a third component of yet more highly excited gas .",
    "any gas in the cnd exposed to the fuv from the agn must also be irradiated by hard x - rays .",

    "what conditions would this occur ?",
    "a first approach to addressing this question is to separately consider the co emission from a pdr with that of a properly selected xdr . in figure  [ pdrxdr ]",
    "we compare the co(19 - 18 ) ( the highest-@xmath15 transition calculated over the full model grid ) flux from the  @xcite pdr models with that of a  @xcite model xdr with @xmath32@xmath439 of the incident flux . this flux ratio is chosen to match the intrinsic @xmath440 ratio of the agn in ngc 1068  @xcite , and is therefore appropriate for a cloud seeing the unattenuated agn emission .",

    ", this approach suggests that the fuv is more important than the x - rays in generating @xmath438 co emission , while only a minor fraction of the agn fuv luminosity would be required to power such a pdr .",
    "where in the nuclear region might these conditions be satisfied ?",
    "the uv / optical emission from the agn escapes to large distances within the ionization cone , which runs roughly north - south in projection .",
    "if the he co emission arises from the h@xmath17 ring , however , the line blueshifts would suggest an origin to the east or west ( section  [ linekinematics ] ) , where little nuclear fuv penetrates .",
    "the northern streamer may have a direct view of the agn , which at a distance of @xmath444 pc would correspond to @xmath445 .",
    "however , the covering factor of this material ( for a size of @xmath3@xmath379 pc ) is only @xmath3@xmath446 .",
    "the contents of figure  [ pdrxdr ] indicate that achieving the absolute he co line fluxes with such a small covering factor would require densities far larger than the @xmath447 @xmath7 indicated by our lvg modeling ( section  [ lvgmodel ] ) .",
    "we therefore argue that the he co emission is unlikely to be fuv - powered , although more detailed modeling of the conversion of fuv radiation to high-@xmath15 co at high densities ( @xmath448 @xmath7 ) and fuv intensities ( @xmath449 ) , and in the presence of an additional x - ray field , would be useful for a more quantitative evaluation of this scenario .",

    "jet - induced shocks are therefore energetically feasible , although would require an efficient mechanism for converting kinetic energy at high velocities into slow molecular shocks .",
    "alternatively , shocks in the bluest regions of the h@xmath17 ring , possibly associated with the ring expansion , could also generate the he co.    an important constraint on this shock modeling is the need to match the co brightness while not overproducing the ro - vibrational h@xmath17 emission .",

    "however , the rotational curve of the maser disk scales as @xmath472  @xcite , so even a factor of 1.5 decrease in the circular velocity would require a factor of @xmath3@xmath473 increase in the radial scale , placing the co - emitting gas well outside of the maser disk .",
    "alternatively , it would be possible to place the he component within the maser disk if we allow that a non - uniform excitation or mass distribution enhances the co emission within the narrower observed velocity range . the strongest argument against associating the he component with the maser disk follows from a comparison of the physical parameters , as the density and/or thermal pressure we estimate for the he component is likely to be smaller than that of the disk .",

    "this limit may be reduced by stacking the individual non - detections .",
    "we have obtained such a stack by first scaling the spectrum of each undetected line by ( @xmath509)@xmath344 , which references each spectrum to that of co(44 - 43 ) under the assumption that the co fluxes scale as @xmath502 .",

    "given the uncertainties in the agn luminosity and covering factor of the comption - thick material in ngc 1068 , as well as uncertainties in the model itself , this factor of @xmath3@xmath524 overprediction is too small to reject the model of a parsec - scale torus envisioned by  @xcite .",
