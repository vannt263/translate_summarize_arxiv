    "analysis of the neutron star structure is an interesting topic of the modern astrophysics . in particular , in the nuclear astrophysics the structure studies of neutron stars are related to the equations of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter which describes the pressure density versus energy density relation for a broad range of density values ( for example , see recent review  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the peculiarities of eos are well know at the densities below the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath4 while at the high density regions they are still remaining not clear . the high density behavior of eos are poorly understood because of the difficulty of direct experimental accessibility in laboratories and because of the absence of _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations .",
    "therefore , from the experimental point of view , the neutron star studies may serve as a laboratory for understanding the behavior of eos at high densities . from the theoretical point of view , instead of _ ab initio _ calculations one can start from the phenomenological framework taking into account the well known properties of eos at the low density region and extrapolate to the high density regions trying to describe the properties of matter under the extreme ( high density and high temperature ) conditions .    in this context and if one able to formulate further in - medium modifications , a chiral soliton model of skyrme , describing the single nucleon properties in free space  @xcite , or its variations including the explicit vector mesonic degrees of freedom  @xcite may serve as a starting point for the theoretical framework .",
    "the in - medium modifications may be expressed allowing the density dependencies of the constants entering into the initial free space lagrangian .",
    "it is necessary to note , that in principle one should be able also to reproduce the medium dependencies in the effective lagrangian starting from the first principles but it is not known yet the form of general low energy lagrangian and the peculiarities of its ingredients . for this reason , in the present work we use an in - medium modified chiral soliton model  @xcite which may be considered as a truncated version of the general low energy lagrangian .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the medium modifications were achieved putting a bit more phenomenology into the initial model , i.e. putting the density dependent functions into the free space skyrme lagrangian according to the pionic - atoms data at low energies  @xcite and properties of asymmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath4 .",
    "although the in - medium modified skyrme lagrangians is assumed to be very truncated version of the possible general lagrangian , it must be applicable to the studies of nuclear many - body problems in the spirit of chiral effective lagrangians .",
    "the pay for the truncation may be the possible deviations from the experimental observables in the sense of quantitative description . nevertheless , the model has obvious virtues : i ) it has the simplest lagrangian among the same class lagrangians , and ii ) it seams have all necessary ingredients for the qualitative description of the strong interaction physics .",
    "these ideas were the basic ruling philosophy behind of the approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and we continue our model studies in the present work .",
    "the model is phenomenological one and must pass as much as possible tests on its applicability to strong interacting systems comparing with other approaches and the experimental indications .",
    "the previous nuclear matter studies  @xcite showed that the in - medium modified skyrme term is responsible for preventing the collapse of nuclear matter to the singularity at high densities in analogy to the free space case where the skyrme term is responsibly for the stabilization of finite size solitons .",
    "the modifications showed that at some values of model parameters the properties of infinite and isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be reproduced well near the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath4",
    ".    it will be interesting to test the applicability of model to the strong interacting systems under the extreme conditions extrapolating the modified equations of state to the high density regions .",
    "therefore , in the present work we make further check of the basic philosophy considering an application of the model for the studies of neutron stars structure .",
    "our starting point is the in - medium modified skyrme - model lagrangian described in ref .",

    "the reason is not only due to the relativistic metric factors coming from the einstein s equations in the calculations of binding energies of neutron stars .",
    "the reason here is rather obvious , the semiempirical liquid - drop formula describes the binding energy per nucleon near the normal nuclear matter densities ( which correspond to the density profiles of the existing heavy nuclei ) and its validity at high densities is not clear .    nevertheless , around the normal nuclear matter density and for the small values of asymmetry parameter @xmath63 , the thermodynamically limiting binding energy per nucleon given in eq .",

    "the symmetry energy @xmath70 describes the energy increase in the system if the number of protons and neutrons becomes not equal relatively to the case when the neutron and proton numbers are same .",

    "although the definition of symmetry energy in eq .",

    "but the extrapolations of eos to the high density ( @xmath72 ) and highly asymmetric ( @xmath65 ) regions remain not clear . in particular , this is due to the reason that in neutron stars the higher order terms in @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ symen ] ) may be also important .",
    "usually , it is assumed that @xmath73 terms are small and the symmetry energy is mostly responsible in describing the properties of neutron stars when the neutron - to - proton number @xmath71 becomes infinite .",
    "becomes infinite .",
    "] in the present approach , the higher order terms @xmath73 come from the explicit isospin breaking symmetry in the mesonic sector and found to be negligible .",

    "further , the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter within the various approaches is found to be @xmath76mev at the saturation density @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these three quantities may be used to fix some of the model parameters ( e.g. @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) if one expands the volume energy into the taylor series @xmath80 around the saturation density , @xmath81 . after fitting the values of parameters ,",

    "@xcite is smaller @xmath82mev in comparison with the compressibility value in model iii @xmath84mev .",

    "in summary , we discussed the application of the in - medium modified chiral soliton model to the studies of asymmetric matter properties and neutron star structure .",
