    "the prime purpose of the paper is to introduce a simple model of the system where first - order phase transition occurs .",
    "one of possible scenarios is presented here , which may lead to such phenomena as melting - freezing or evaporation - condensation .",
    "the task is mainly of didactic character . it does not discover any new types of systems in question but , basing on a very simple model , shows what are essential properties of the first - order transition .",
    "the model is meant to provide an introductory exercise for those students who plan to get involved in research of such phenomena , that is why numerous simplifications are applied in the model .",
    "+ due to simplicity , our model allows for formal ( mathematical ) calculation of some thermodynamic quantities ( e.g. temperature of the transition , latent heat per molecule ) as well as for the use of numerical simulation methods .",
    "both approaches were taken in the present work .",
    "it is well known that one of the simplest attempts to classify phase transitions takes into account existence of latent heat .",
    "hence , first - order phase transitions are those that involve latent heat ( e.g. melting , evaporation ) while second - order phase transitions do not ( e.g. ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition ) .",
    "there are a lot of models which describe phase transitions of both types .",
    "they are standard models such as ising model , lattice gas model , xy model @xcite but also some innovatory ones @xcite .",
    "the initial point for most of them is hamiltonian of the system for which partition function ( or another statistical quantity ) can be calculated . then the partition function is examined and discontinuities or singularities , which may be responsible for the presence of the phase transition , are searched @xcite .    in our model",
    "the situation is opposite to some extent .",
    "we start constructing the model on the intuitive premise and only then the formal analysis may reveal that the partition function of the system has singularity at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "what features of crystal - liquid or liquid - gas transitions , apart from the latent heat , are most characteristic ?",
    "it can be said that it is a well defined temperature ( for fixed pressure ) of the transition .",
    "below this temperature we have only phase i ( e.g. crystalline solid ) while above there is only phase ii ( e.g. liquid ) . both phases ( generally )",
    "differ considerably from each other ( symmetry , viscosity , compressibility , etc . ) , what means that a very little change of temperature of the system causes a dramatic change in the arrangement of molecules .",
    "main purpose of our model is to explain intuitively how it is possible .",
    "a process of random walking at discrete time was adopted in our model in order to describe dynamics .",
    "basic properties of melting are shown to be caused by the fact that there exists a border between the phases . only near",
    "that border molecules may change their attachment to the phase .",
    "far off the border they are blocked by their neighbours .",
    "such a situation results in an exponential distribution of the energy spectrum of the system , the fact being a condition for the relation between energy and entropy to be linear so that phase transition may take place .",
    "the quantum system with a free hamiltonian @xmath0 is a basic element of our model .",
    "the spectrum consists of @xmath1 ( discrete , non - degenerated ) levels , which are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "such a system is called a molecule .    the lower @xmath2 levels , numbered from 0 to @xmath3 , are called the levels of the first phase while the upper @xmath4 levels ( from @xmath2 to @xmath1 ) are the levels of the second phase .",
    "energy of the @xmath5-th level of the molecule is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is energy of lowest level of phase ii and @xmath8 is energy gap between the phases , the existence of with is not necessary but added to make our consideration more general .",
    "what is more , our model is operational even if we assume @xmath9 .    neither the evident form of @xmath0 nor its , , origin  is needed",
    "however , it is better for intuitive understanding to imagine that the states of @xmath0 are the states of the motion of a molecule rather than the states of its internal electron excitations .",
    "in the following part of our work we examine behaviour of such molecules which , due to the interactions with external environment ( thermostat ) , change their state and jump at random to a neighbouring level ( upper or lower ) .",
    "the chance of jumping has been limited to transitions between the neighbouring levels only .",
    "such a limitation is merely technical simplification and does not affect the appearance of the phase transition .      in the present paper",
    "we examine a system consisted of @xmath10 molecules ( as introduced in the previous subsection ) , which are numbered from 1 to @xmath10 and set into a one - dimensional lattice ( fig.2 ) .",
    "additionally , it was assumed that individual molecules can interact with each other .",
    "the interaction does not change the structure of levels in fig .  1 but causes that some of them become unavailable for the molecule , what means that there appear some restriction rules ( which are essential for the phase transition to come into being ) :    1",
    ".   the @xmath11 molecule may jump up from the top level of the first phase ( i.e. @xmath12 level ) onto the lowest level of the second phase ( i.e. @xmath13 level ) only if the left ( i.e. @xmath14 ) neighbour of the molecule is currently in the second phase , 2 .",
    "the @xmath11 molecule may jump down off the lowest level of the second phase ( i.e. @xmath15 level ) to the top level of the first phase ( @xmath12 level ) only if the right ( @xmath16 ) neighbour of the molecule is currently in the first phase , 3 .",
    "exceptions : first molecule ( @xmath17 ) is always able to jump from @xmath12 level to @xmath18 level , last molecule ( @xmath19 ) is always able to jump from @xmath18 level to @xmath12 level , 4 .   only that distribution of states was always chosen as the initial state of the simulation , for which all the molecules in phase ii lie on the left to all of the molecules in phase i.    the foregoing rules set up a border between the phases ( analogous to a free surface ) in the system .",
    "transitions of molecules from the first phase to the second phase are possible only at the border of the phases . a molecule , which gathers enough energy to jump into a different phase , is not able to do it until its appropriate neighbour has done it first so the molecule is blocked by its neighbour and has to wait for its turn .",
    "it is shown below that such a property of the model guarantees that the first - order phase transition can exist .      *",
    "our model is one - dimensional while systems in nature are usually 3-dimensional , * molecules in phase ii are distinguishable in our lattice while in gases and liquids they are undistinguishable , * molecules in phase i have energy levels which are mutually independent in our model while in crystals their energy levels are common ( collective fonon excitations ) , * distribution of levels in both phases of our model are uniform ; there are regular gaps between the levels , * in our model the space , which is occupied by each phase is compact ( i.e. it is in one piece ) while in the real systems the phases may by mixed with each other as in fog , for example , when one phase is a suspension in another phase .",
    "such an assumption is of a special kind because it is not connected with a character of local interaction between molecules but introduces some global limitations to possible configurations of the system .",
    "although non - natural , the assumption is necessary for mathematical simplifications .",
    "our model is only a simple demonstration of process of growing ( decline ) a single drop of liquid during condensation ( evaporation ) .",
    "let us consider a single ( free ) molecule defined in fig .  1 . a canonical partition function for such a system is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is contribution of the states , which belong to phase i : @xmath22 while @xmath23 is a contribution of states , which belong to phase ii : @xmath24    in low temperature ( i.e. for @xmath25 ) a free molecule can be found in the first phase more often than in the second . if @xmath26 ( i.e. number of levels in phase ii is greater than the number of levels in phase i ) the opposite situation is possible . in high temperatures ( when @xmath27 ) the probability that a free molecule is in the second phase is greater than the probability of finding it in first phase .",
    "there is a temperature at which the levels of both phases can be occupied by molecules with the same probability : @xmath28 it will be shown that such a temperature is the one of the phase transition in our model ( fig .  2 )",
    "this temperature will be marked by @xmath29 and its reverse by @xmath30 .",
    "let us introduce hamiltonian of the lattice ( fig .",
    "2 ) in an evident form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is direct sum , @xmath0 is a free hamiltonian of single molecule , and @xmath33 is an interaction hamiltonian responsible for restriction rules as given in section 2.2 .",
    "the way hamiltonian @xmath33 acts can be imagined as that : it increases energies of , , forbidden  eigenstates of hamiltonian @xmath34 by a certain very high value @xmath35 what results in an insignificant probability of forbidden eigenstates to be occupied .    partition function of the lattice is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath21 and @xmath23 are given by eq .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath40 function gets divergent as @xmath10 approaches infinity ( due to @xmath42 and @xmath43 )",
    ". however , with @xmath44 tending to @xmath30 there appears a further divergence ( divergence of the sum of geometric series ) .",

    "it is convenient to use markov chains to make it possible to understand why phase transition occurs in our model .",
    "the states of the process are numbered 0 to @xmath10 and they define the number of molecules occupying phase ii ( or in other words a position of the phase border in our lattice ) .",
