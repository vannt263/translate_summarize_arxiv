    "the search for a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has a high priority at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "van hove@xcite and others@xcite have proposed that bubbles localized in phase space ( dense gluon - dominated hot spots ) could be the sources of final state hadrons from a qgp .",
    "such structures would have smaller spatial dimensions than the region of the fireball .",
    "correlations resulting from these smaller structures might persist in the final state of the collision .",
    "the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) results demonstrate that for @xmath3 = 200 gev mid rapidity central au + au , when @xmath4 0.8 gev / c the average final state space geometry for pairs close in momentum is approximately described by dimensions of around 2 fm@xcite .",
    "this should lead to observable modification of the @xmath5 correlation .",
    "the @xmath0 correlation function@xcite is defined as :    @xmath6    where s(@xmath0 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath0 coming from the same event , after we have summed over all the events .",
    "m(@xmath0 ) is the number of pairs at the corresponding values of @xmath0 coming from the mixed events , after we have summed over all our created mixed events .",
    "a mixed event pair has each of the two particles chosen from a different event .",
    "* table i. the minimum bias data is split up into standard star binning . *     au + au collisions & centrality + 70% to 80% & peripheral + 60% to 70% & + 50% to 60% & + 40% to 50% & + 30% to 40% & + 20% to 30% & + 10% to 20% & + 5% to 10% & + 0% to 5% & most central +    the mixed events were selected based on centrality and the z ( beam axis ) position of the primary vertex .",
    "the events selections was achieved by sorting events into the centrality bins above and ten 5 cm wide bins covering -25 cm to + 25 cm in z vertex .",
    "thus only tracks were mixed for events which had the same multiplicity and acceptance .",
    "using equation 1 , we can form @xmath0 correlations for unlike - sign charge pairs ( us ) and like - sign charge pairs ( ls ) .",
    "we can also form a @xmath0 correlation using all the particle pair combinations which would be charge independent .",
    "this ci ( charge independent ) correlation is equal to the average of the us and ls correlations .",
    "@xmath7    we also can form a charge dependent ( cd ) correlation by taking the difference between the us and the ls correlations .    @xmath8    the ci correlation is a quantitative measure of the average structure of the correlated emitting sources . the cd correlation is a qualitative measure of the emission correlation of unlike - sign charge pairs emitted from the same space and time region .",
    "simular ci and cd are used by other star analyses .",
    "the signal present in the correlation comes from pairs that are correlated .",
    "the number of signal pairs increase linearly with the number of particles .",
    "the total number of pairs is proportional to the square of the number of particles .",
    "thus the ratio of signal pairs to all pairs decrease as 1/particles .",
    "we can cancel out this effect by multiplying the cd and ci correlations by the multiplicity of particles used in forming the correlations .",
    "we compare the cd yield in figure 1 and the overall shape of the cd in figure 2 .",
    "multiplicity scaling is used in figure 1 while we normalize each centrality in figure 2 . in figure 2",
    "the @xmath9 for 0.0 @xmath10 0.3 is normalized to 1 .",
    "all other @xmath1 bins are determined by this normalization .",
    "we need to compare the ci yield for the different centralities .",
    "the ci correlation as a function of @xmath0 averages to 1 over the @xmath0 range . in order to compare the signal strength we must multiply by the multiplicity for each centrality .",
    "the scale correlation will then have a much different range and be hard to compare .",
    "the average multiplicity ranges from 6 to 216 .",
    "we choose to shift up each scaled correlation until it is in the 216 range .",
    "elliptic flow is a background that we need to worry about .",
    "the elliptic flow is given by @xmath11 and is symmetric about @xmath0 = @xmath12 .",
    "for a constant value of elliptic flow ( @xmath13 ) , the scaled correlation will get a bigger dip at @xmath0 = @xmath12 with increasing multiplicity .",
    "the dip is proportional to the multiplicity .",
    "elliptic flow ( @xmath13 ) decreases linearly with centrality and the correlation has a quadratic dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "thus for the scaled correlation the elliptic flow effect increases because the multiplicity is increasing and then decreases because of the quadratic response of @xmath13 , becoming very small at the most central ( 0% to 5% ) .",
    "to first order we want to remove the @xmath13 effect from the comparison . if the away side of the scaled correlation ( @xmath0 = @xmath14 ) is mainly @xmath13 then a signal on the near side ( @xmath0 = @xmath15 ) would rise above the value of the away side .",
    "thus if we would shift all scaled correlations such that the away side is equal , then we could compare the signals on the near side .",
    "the scaled ci correlation is split up into 5 @xmath1 bins ( figure 3 to figure 7 ) .",
    "each centrality for a given @xmath1 bin is plotted with the away side ( @xmath0 = @xmath14 ) scaled correlation shifted to the same value .",
    "the horizontal line for each centrality shows the shifted average multiplicity line which was 1 in the original ci correlation and became equal the average multiplicity after becoming the scaled correlation .",
    "we have assumed in our comparison that the elliptic flow accounted for the away side peak .",
    "a bubble model@xcite predicts that there should be an away side correlation between bubbles .",
    "thus our normalization would lead to a reduced signal on the near side .",
    "the bubble model@xcite showed that there is an away side signal when the width of the away side becomes much wider then the near side as it does for the most central ( 0% to 5% ) .",
    "the scaled cd correlations increase with centrality see figure 1 . the scaled ci correlations increase until 20% centrality and remains the same for the rest of the centralities .",
    "if we assume the wider away side peak is also a signal , we have a consistent picture between the scaled cd and ci correlations , both increasing with centrality .",
    "ref.@xcite is in good agreement with our central cd and ci correlations .",
    "the bubble model@xcite assumes localized gluonic hot spots on the surface of the fireball created by the central au + au collision .",
