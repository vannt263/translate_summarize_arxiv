    "although quantum fluctuations of the inflaton are often taken to be responsible for the origin of density perturbations , other mechanisms such as the curvaton @xcite , where fluctuations of a scalar field other than the inflaton generate primordial perturbations , have also attracted much attention recently . in particular , in the light of the recent result from wmap5 which suggests that primordial non - gaussianity may be large @xcite .",
    "the current constraint on @xmath3 is @xmath12 in ref .",
    "@xcite or @xmath13 at @xmath14 c.l . in ref .",
    "although purely gaussian fluctuations with @xmath15 are allowed , the central value is away from zero . ]",
    ", the curvaton mechanism may be attractive since a large primordial non - gaussianity can be generated in this scenario @xcite , whereas simplest inflation models predict a non - linearity parameter @xmath3 that is of the order of the slow - roll parameters ( or o(1 ) at most ) , and hence practically imply a gaussian perturbation .",
    "usually the curvaton potential is assumed to be quadratic .",
    "however , there is no other reason for this except simplicity , and in fact in any realistic particle physics model the curvaton can be expected to have some self - interactions .",
    "thus , deviations from the exact quadratic form are also worth investigating .",
    "they have been discussed in @xcite , where it has been pointed out that non - quadratic contributions to the potential can modify the resultant curvaton perturbations in a significant manner . in particular , the prediction for the non - linearity parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 can change considerably as compared to the quadratic case .",
    "in addition , there is yet another assumption which is tacitly adopted in the curvaton literature : the background evolution of the universe is determined by radiation . with this assumption ,",
    "the curvaton starts to oscillate during a radiation - dominated ( rd ) epoch .",
    "if the curvaton decays before dominating the universe , radiation is always the dominant component and controls the background evolution of the universe .",
    "however , it is also possible that after inflation , the inflaton is oscillating around the minimum of the potential for a while and that the curvaton begins to oscillate during such epoch . in this case , the background evolution is different from the case of radiation and is determined by a matter - like component if the inflaton potential is approximatively quadratic .",
    "after inflation there could also exist a possibility of a kination - dominated phase where the kinetic term of some scalar field can dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "such fluid has a stiff equation of state with @xmath16 while its energy density decreases as @xmath17 .    in this paper , we investigate how the background evolution of the universe affects the curvature perturbation generated from the curvaton .",
    "we first show that when the curvaton potential has a quadratic form , the background evolution has little effect on the curvature perturbation .",
    "however , when the curvaton potential includes a non - quadratic term , the nonlinear evolution of the curvaton field is affected much by the background , and the resultant curvature perturbations can be significantly modified from the usual rd case .",
    "we investigate this issue by assuming a general background fluid and a potential that slightly deviates from a quadratic form , and derive the dependence of the curvature perturbation and/or the non - linearity parameters such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 on different background fluids .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the formalism and give definitions of the quantities required for the subsequent analysis . in section  [ sec : effect ] , we discuss how the background evolution affects the quantities such as power spectrum and non - linearity parameters , using the appropriate formulas for arbitrary background fluids .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and a discussion of the results .",
    "let us begin by summarizing the formalism and the definitions of the various quantities required for the subsequent discussion . here",
    "we consider a potential of the curvaton field @xmath18 which , in addition to the usual quadratic term , also includes a non - renormalizable term : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass of the curvaton , and @xmath21 is a constant . for the purpose of this paper , it is enough to investigate the case of a slight deviation from the purely quadratic form .",
    "thus in the following we assume that the quadratic term always dominates over the non - quadratic term ( for a general discussion of the ramifications of non - quadratic terms in curvaton models , see @xcite ) .",
    "we characterize the relative contribution of the non - quadratic term at the time when the curvaton is still in a slowly - rolling regime by the parameter @xmath22 , defined as @xmath23    to investigate the curvature perturbation @xmath24 generated by the curvaton field , we adopt the @xmath25 formalism @xcite and calculate @xmath24 up to the third order as @xmath26 once we obtain @xmath24 up to the third order , the power spectrum @xmath27 , bispectum @xmath28 , and trispectrum @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath4 are non - linearity parameters often used in the literature .",
    "note that , in our case , @xmath37 is related to @xmath3 by @xmath38 thus , alternatively , we may assume the following expansion as the definition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the curvature perturbation at linear order .",
    "let us now derive the formulae for the power spectrum , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a general background equation of state . as we mentioned in the introduction , usually one assumes that the curvaton oscillates in a radiation background evolution .",
    "however , it is obvious that the inflaton can be expected to oscillate around the minimum of its ( quadratic ) potential for some time before it decays . for a weakly coupled inflaton field",
    ", the duration of this epoch could be fairly long . during that time the inflaton behaves like matter ,",
    "and it is possible that the curvaton oscillations begin during this epoch .",
    "eventually the inflaton will decay into radiation ; this can well happen before the curvaton oscillations dominate the energy budget of the universe , or before the curvaton decay , whichever happens first .",
    "hence the universe becomes radiation - dominated so that the background evolution for oscillating curvaton is controlled first by a matter component , followed by radiation domination .",
    "having this kind of situation in mind , let us assume there is a transition in the background from one fluid to another one at time @xmath41 .",
    "we then parametrize the energy density of the background fluid before the transition time by @xmath42 whereas after the transition , for @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 for the case of oscillating inflaton background , the transition epoch @xmath41 corresponds to the time when the inflaton decays . in this case , for @xmath45 , @xmath46 while for @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "another example is a universe that is first kination - dominated so that the kinetic energy of a scalar field dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "then , after some time , the universe becomes radiation - dominated . in this case ,",
    "@xmath49 for @xmath45 while after the transition time @xmath50 .    with this parametrization",
    ", we obtain the curvature perturbation at the linear order as @xmath51 where @xmath52 the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 roughly correspond to the fraction of energy density of the curvaton to the total energy density at the time of the curvaton decay and the transition of the background , respectively .",
    "their precise definitions are @xmath56 furthermore , @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 by calculating the curvature perturbation up to the third order , we find that the non - linearity parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 read as @xmath59,\\ ] ]    @xmath60,\\ ] ]    here the derivatives of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath62 appear .",
    "they are given in terms of the derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 with respect to @xmath62 as @xmath63 and @xmath64 the derivatives @xmath65 and @xmath66 are explicitly given by @xmath67 ( 1 -k r_{\\rm tr } ) , \\\\",
    "\\frac{d r_{\\rm tr}}{d \\sigma_{\\rm osc } } & = & \\frac{2}{3\\sigma_{\\rm osc } } r_{\\rm tr } ( 1-r_{\\rm tr } ) [ 3 + ( \\alpha-3 ) r_{\\rm tr } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 with respect to @xmath62 can be derived by differentiating the above equations and they are calculated as @xmath68 - \\frac{2k}{3\\sigma_{\\rm osc } } \\frac{d r_{\\rm tr}}{d \\sigma_{\\rm osc } } r_{\\rm dec } ( 1-r_{\\rm dec } ) \\ { 3 + ( \\beta-3 ) r_{\\rm dec } \\ } , \\notag \\\\",

    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath4 may approximately be written as @xmath74 .",
    "\\notag \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can notice from these expressions , when @xmath54 is small , which is the interesting case because then non - gaussianity can be large , the effects of the background are almost encoded in the changes of @xmath62 and its derivatives .",
    "the quantities such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 are evaluated at the beginning of the curvaton oscillation , and thus the background evolution after the transition is irrelevant if we assume a nearly quadratic potential for the curvaton .",
    "thus in this case , after its change the background evolution does not affect much the curvature perturbation but modifies @xmath40 and its non - linearity parameters at most of order @xmath77 .",
    "this can be seen directly from the above expressions : @xmath78 affects the coefficients by @xmath77 .",
    "if there is no change in the background evolution up to or until after the time at which the curvaton decays , the expressions for the curvature perturbation and non - linearity parameters are quite similar to the case with @xmath79 mentioned above . in this case , we can simply set @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the above equations",
    ". then @xmath82 and @xmath4 can be found by replacing @xmath78 with @xmath2 in eqs .  , and .",
    "let us now apply the formalism of the previous section and discuss how the background evolution affects the amplitude of the curvature perturbation and its non - linearity parameters .",
    "as we pointed out , the transition in the background does not affect the perturbation much if the transition occurs much before curvaton decay .",
    "hence here we focus on the case of no transition in the background , i.e. , a single fluid controls the background evolution from the time well before the curvaton begins to oscillate to well after the curvaton has decayed .    when there is no transition in the background evolution we can adopt the formulae eqs .  ,",
    "and by replacing @xmath78 by @xmath2 in the equations , as mentioned above . to appreciate the impact of background evolution on the curvature perturbation and its nonlinearity , we plot @xmath82 and @xmath4 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fnl_gnl_n][fig : fnl_gnl ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl_gnl_n ] , the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are shown as a function of @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_s ] ) for the definition of the dimension of the non - quadratic contribution to the potential ) for the cases of @xmath84 and @xmath85 which correspond to matter , radiation and kination background , respectively , in our notation .",
    "as seen from the figures , the larger the non - quadratic power @xmath83 is , the more pronounced the effect of the background becomes .    to observe the magnitude of the effect more quantitatively , the values of @xmath82 and @xmath4 relative to those for the case with @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    "are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : zeta_1][fig : gnl_1 ] for several values of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath2 . in these figures",
    ", we fix the relative strength of the non - quadratic part @xmath22 and @xmath54 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : zeta_2][fig : gnl_2 ] we also plot the same information but this time for several values of @xmath22 , fixing @xmath90 and @xmath54 .",
    "interestingly , when the potential of the curvaton is close to a purely quadratic one , the background evolution does not affect the results much",
    ". however , whenever the potential deviates from the quadratic form , the background tends to suppress the curvature perturbation @xmath40 the more non - quadratic the potential is .",
    "it should also be noted that when @xmath2 increases , or the background fluid becomes more stiff , @xmath40 becomes suppressed . for",
    "fixed @xmath22 and @xmath83 , the stiffening of the background fluid drives @xmath3 and @xmath91 to increasingly negative territory .",
    "a point worth stressing is that these modifications are not small but e.g. by changing of the radiation dominated background to matter dominated one induces shifts in the non - linearity parameters that in principle could be easily observable .",
    "finally , let us comment on the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , when the potential of the curvaton has a purely quadratic form and @xmath92 is small , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related as @xmath93 however , when the potential deviates from a quadratic form ,  the consistency relation \" between @xmath3 and @xmath4 becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is assumed . because of the nonlinear evolution of @xmath18 , which is encoded in @xmath62 and its derivatives appearing on the right hand side of eq .  , the nonlinearity parameters are now related as @xmath96 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the quadratic case where @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , since the coefficient of the relation depends on the nonlinear evolution of @xmath18 , it can be affected by the form of the potential and the background evolution . in this respect ,",
    "the comparison of @xmath3 and @xmath98 , if they ever are observed has been obtained for the case of a negligible @xmath3 ; the limit is @xmath99 @xcite . ] , can be very useful for probing the form of the curvaton potential and the equation of state of the background during the time when the curvaton fluctuations generate the curvature perturbation .    to demonstrate this explicitly , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl_gnl ] we plot the value of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 for several values of @xmath2 with @xmath90 and @xmath100 . for reference , we also plot the case of the pure quadratic potential with rd background @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath3 is large , which corresponds to the case of @xmath95 , the above relations hold . as a consequence , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl_gnl ] , there is a definite difference in the @xmath102 relation for different backgrounds even when the non - quadratic term in the curvaton potential remains the same .",
    "thus the trispectrum may also provide important information not only about the curvaton potential but also about the equation of state of the background fluid during curvaton oscillations .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the effect of the background evolution on the curvaton non - gaussianity , assuming a curvaton potential which slightly deviates from the quadratic one .",
    "such a study is motivated by the possibility that after inflation , the inflaton keeps oscillating about its global minimum for a long time so that the curvaton could actually decay while the universe is still effectively matter dominated .",
    "more exotic temporary possibilities , such as a kination driven universe , could also be envisaged .",
    "therefore we have considered an ideal background fluid with some generic equation of state , leading to a background evolution @xmath103 , with @xmath2 a free parameter .",
    "it turns out that the changing of the background to radiation , or equivalently , a change in the value of @xmath2 , that takes place during curvaton oscillations , has by itself little effect on the perturbation .",
    "what matters is the nature of the background evolution before radiation domination finally kicks in , and as we show , it can lead to significant and potentially observable consequences .",
    "the non - linearity parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as well as the linear curvature perturbation @xmath40 , depend on the nature of the background fluid .",
    "we find that the dependence on the background fluid becomes more pronounced as the deviation of the curvaton potential from the quadratic one increases .",
    "typically , when replacing one background fluid with another , one induces effects on @xmath3 that are easily of the order of @xmath104 but could also be much larger , depending on the relative strength of the non - quadratic part of the potential .",
    "an interesting issue is the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have showed that the relation depends both on the form of the curvaton potential and the background evolution , which we find a rather surprising result . hence measuring",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , or both the bispectrum and the trispectrum , would yield information not only on the curvaton self - interactions but also on the equation of state of the background fluid . since that is linked to dynamics in the inflaton sector , here",
    "arises a possibility of probing inflaton physics at the very end of inflation .",
