    "_  [ ] showed that this cdw order has a predominant d - wave form factor in several cuprate families such as yba@xmath4cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath8 and ca@xmath9na@xmath10cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 .",
    "this observation of cdw order has prompted theoretical interest in the origin of the axial ordering wave vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , many theoretical approaches predict a dominant instability towards a cdw with d - wave form factor at diagonal wave vectors @xmath11 , whereas the experimentally observed axial wave vectors appear only as a subleading instability.@xcite other theoretical works argue that the dominant instability is indeed at the axial ordering wave vector , either because of the interplay between cdw and superconductivity,@xcite the effect of a sufficiently large nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath12 in a @xmath13-@xmath14-@xmath12 model,@xcite or because of other microscopic details.@xcite    the observed charge - density wave with a d - wave form factor is akin to an incommensurate ising - nematic order . for this reason we revisit the problem of two - dimensional metals close to an ising - nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) , which has been studied thoroughly in the past,@xcite with the aim to determine the wave vector at which nematic fluctuations are strongest .",
    "in fact , a similar analysis has been performed earlier within a random phase approximation ( rpa ) by holder and metzner ,  @xcite where it was shown that the static nematic susceptibility is largest along @xmath15 lines , i.e.  at momenta connecting points on the fermi surface with parallel tangents .",
    "more precisely , they found that the nematic susceptibility for electron densities larger than van - hove filling@xcite is maximal at diagonal wave vectors @xmath16 where two @xmath15 lines cross .",
    "again , these results suggest that the ordering along axial wave vectors is a subleading instability .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the static nematic susceptibility can also be maximal at axial wave vectors @xmath2 and @xmath3 , depending on the nesting properties ( i.e.  the curvature ) of the fermi surface in the antinodal region .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently strong nesting of the fermi surface in the antinodal region , the maximum of the nematic susceptibility is precisely at the antinodal nesting wave vector within a simple rpa calculation .",
    "even though the antinodal nesting wave vector is closer to the experimentally observed ordering wave vector than the diagonal one , it misses one essential feature .",
    "experiments suggest that the cdw ordering wave vector connects the tips of the fermi arcs in the pseudo - gap regime , rather than the putative fermi surface in the antinodes.@xcite this observation might be suggestive of the fact that the cdw order is a secondary instability of a genuine pseudogap phase which already features a reconstructed fermi surface.@xcite    here we point out one possible resolution how the observed ordering wave vector could be reconciled with the picture of a cdw instability of an ordinary fermi liquid with a large fermi surface . in the nematic qcp scenario electrons close to the antinodes interact strongly and are no well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "nematic fluctuations are strongest at @xmath15 lines where quasiparticle coherence is important , however .",
    "it is thus conceivable that the maximum of the nematic susceptibility shifts to larger wave vectors which connect points on the fermi surface away from the antinodes where the quasiparticle coherence is larger , even though these points have no perfectly parallel tangents . in this paper we present results from an eliashberg - type calculation of the nematic susceptibility which suggest that this is indeed the case , even though this effect is rather small .",
    "the wave vector is only slightly shifted away from the antinodes , and we conclude that the nematic qcp scenario alone can hardly account for the experimentally observed cdw ordering wave vector .",
    "superconducting fluctuations , which are clearly important in the context of cuprates , likely increase this shift of the cdw ordering wave vector , but a detailed study of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another interesting result from the eliashberg computation is that the maximum of the nematic susceptibility shifts to zero wave vector at sufficiently high temperatures above @xmath0 .",
    "the incommensurate cdw fluctuations at low temperatures thus appear as ordinary , intra - unit - cell nematic fluctuations at higher temperatures .",
    "indeed , intra - unit - cell nematicity has been reported in cuprates below the pseudogap temperature.@xcite however , due to the gradual onset of cdw order as a function of temperature it is not clear at present if these observations are related , or if a regime with intra - unit cell nematicity exists above the onset of cdw order.@xcite    the rest of the paper is outlined as follows : in sec .",

    "together with the ising symmetry @xmath40 the action is invariant under the square lattice point group . at the level of the bare action the ising symmetry is broken for @xmath41 , in which case the point group symmetry",

    "these special momenta connect points on the fermi surface with parallel tangents and are simple lattice generalizations of @xmath15-momenta in systems with a circular fermi surface.@xcite at electron densities higher than van - hove filling the maximum of the nematic susceptibility is at the diagonal wave vectors @xmath62 , where the two @xmath63 lines with @xmath64 and @xmath65 intersect .",

    "here we want to point out that the momentum along the @xmath63 lines where the nematic susceptibility is maximal also depends on the curvature of the fermi surface in the antinodal region around @xmath70 and symmetry related points in the model with a site - centered ising - nematic field considered here . for the case of sufficiently strong antinodal nesting ,",

    "we note that this is no longer the case if effects beyond rpa are taken into account .",
    "within eliashberg theory the maximum shifts to @xmath78 at @xmath75 , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : eliashberg ] .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the experimentally observed cdw ordering wave vectors do not seem to connect the fermi surface at the antinodal points .",
    "rather , it has been suggested that the ordering wave vectors connect the tip of the fermi arcs in the pseduogap phase.@xcite even though the rpa results above give the correct qualitative form of the ordering wave vectors if the fermi surface is sufficiently nested in the antinodes , there is clearly something missing .",
    "indeed , nematic fluctuations give rise to a strong interaction between electrons in the antinodes , which in turn leads to a suppressed quasiparticle coherence for electrons with momenta in the antinodal region .",
    "the nematic susceptibility is very sensitive to quasiparticle coherence , however , and thus it is reasonable to expect that the maximum of the susceptibility shifts to larger wave vectors connecting points on the fermi surface that are no longer perfectly nested , but have a larger quasiparticle residue . for this reason it is important to study the susceptibility beyond rpa , where such effects are not taken into account .",
    "the next section contains detailed results for the nematic susceptibility within eliashberg theory , but for now we keep our discussion at a phenomenological level . the simplest approach to include electronic quasiparticle coherence in rpa is to compute the d - wave polarization function in eq .   with renormalized electron propagators",
    "@xmath79 the quasiparticle residue @xmath80 is unity along the nodal lines @xmath81 , where the electrons do not interact with nematic fluctuations , and falls off towards the antinodes .",
    "a very simple phenomenological parametrization of the quasiparticle residue consistent with the square lattice symmetry takes the form @xmath82 in fig .",
    "[ fig : zk ] we show the static d - wave polarization function computed with a quasiparticle residue of this form .",
    "as anticipated , the local maximum of the nematic susceptibility indeed shifts to larger wave vectors , indicated by the red dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] . including @xmath80 the wave vector of the maximum changes from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , which connects points on the fermi surface away from the antinode with tangents that are no longer perfectly parallel .",
    "it is important to note that the global maximum of the susceptibility changes from axial to diagonal wave vectors @xmath74 in this simple scenario considered here .",
    "this is not surprising , because the quasiparticle residue at the antiferromagnetic hot - spots is larger in the ansatz and the diagonal wave vector still connects points on the fermi surface with parallel tangents . within eliashberg theory , where the damping of electronic quasiparticles along the fermi surface is determined selfconsistently ,",
    "this is not necessarily true , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "we now turn to a self - consistent one loop calculation of the d - wave polarization function @xmath85 and the electronic self - energy @xmath86 . in the spirit of eliashberg",
    "theory vertex corrections are neglected and we comment on the validity of this approximation later .",
    "writing the full electron and nematic fluctuation propagators as @xmath87 the coupled eliashberg equations for the electronic and bosonic self - energies take the form @xmath88 where we used the abbreviation @xmath89 again .",
    "we solve these coupled equations numerically after analytic continuation to real frequencies by a fixed point iteration on a grid of up to @xmath90 points in the first brillouin zone and @xmath91 points along the frequency axis .",
    "for all results shown in this section the coupling constant is chosen as @xmath92 and the gap @xmath93 of the nematic fluctuation propagator @xmath94 is fixed at the value @xmath95 at a temperature @xmath66 ( we do not fix the gap at @xmath96 at @xmath97 for numerical reasons ) . at higher temperatures",
    "the boson gap is determined self - consistently and at @xmath75 we obtain @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , we fixed the renormalized chemical potential @xmath99 at the nodal point to avoid large shifts of the fermi surface .",
    "computed within eliashberg theory at a temperature @xmath66 ( upper left ) and @xmath75 ( upper right ) .",
    "the lower panel shows cuts through @xmath100 along the x - axis and the brillouin zone diagonal .",
    "parameters : @xmath101 . ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig : eliashberg ] we plot the static d - wave polarization function @xmath102 for two different temperatures as a function of momenta .",
    "in contrast to the rpa results a substantial broadening of the @xmath63 singularities is already visible at low temperatures @xmath66 , which we attribute to the the reduced quasiparticle coherence of electrons close to the antinodes , as discussed earlier .",
    "the maximum of the static nematic susceptibility remains at the axial wave vectors @xmath103 and symmetry related points .",
    "we note , however , that it is almost degenerate with the local maxima at the diagonal wave vectors , where the susceptibility is a quarter percent smaller .",
    "the wave vector @xmath103 is slightly larger than the antinodal nesting wave vector and connects points on the fermi surface away from the antinodes .",
    "indeed , we determined the antinodal nesting wave vector from the maximum of the electron spectral function @xmath104 at @xmath66 and zero frequency to be @xmath105 and the wave vector @xmath106 thus connects hotspots at @xmath107 on the fermi surface .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath63 singularities are no longer visible at higher temperatures above @xmath108 and the nematic susceptibility is maximal at @xmath38 instead .",
    "the appearance of such a preemptive @xmath38 nematic order has been discussed earlier in the context cuprates and iron - pnictides.@xcite     at a temperature @xmath75 , plotted as a function of frequency for three different momenta along the fermi surface .",
    "the inset indicates the position of the three momenta on the fermi surface .",
    "parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eliashberg ] . ]",
    "finally we present results for the electron spectral function @xmath109 within eliashberg theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig : specfunc ] we plot @xmath109 at a temperature @xmath75 as function of frequency for three different momenta along the fermi surface .",
    "the spectral function exhibits a peak at the fermi energy and its width increases towards the antinodes .",
    "there is clearly no pseudogap , i.e.  no suppression of spectral weight at the fermi energy close to the antinodes .",
    "similar results were obtained already in ref .  [ ] .",
    "it has been argued , however , that the interplay between cdw and d - wave superconducting fluctuations leads to the formation of a low - temperature pseudogap.@xcite      the validity of the eliashberg approximation for two - dimensional metals close to a @xmath38 nematic critical point has been analysed in detail in ref .",
    "one of the requirements there is that the effective four - fermion interaction @xmath110 is small compared to the bandwidth , i.e.  @xmath111 in order for the leading order vertex correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] to be small . here",
    "we want to emphasize one important difference for the case of nematic fluctuations at the axial wave - vector @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , the scattering geometry in this case is such that one of the internal electron propagators is always off - shell and the first order vertex correction is small even in a regime where @xmath113 as considered here . indeed , setting @xmath114 in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] one can easily see that the electron with momentum @xmath115 is far away from the fermi surface if the incoming and outgoing electrons are at the hotspots connected by @xmath106 .    to be more explicit , the vertex correction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] takes the form @xmath116 note that @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the fully dressed electron and fluctuation propagators obtained within eliashberg theory . in order to compute the renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath26 we project the vertex correction @xmath119 at zero external frequencies onto the d - wave form factor @xmath31 from eq .   and obtain @xmath120 where the factor @xmath121 is for normalization .",
    "computing the integral we obtain @xmath122 at @xmath73 and @xmath123 at @xmath124 .",
    "note that these vertex corrections are relatively small even though the four - fermion interaction @xmath125 is larger than the bandwidth @xmath13 by a factor of @xmath126 for the parameters used here .",
    "we presented numerical results for the nematic susceptibility of electrons on a square lattice below half filling .",
    "in contrast to models of electrons coupled to a bond - centered ising - nematic order parameter field , the model used here exhibits a site - centered field , which can be interpreted as a deformation of a zhang - rice singlet centered on the copper sites in the context of hole - doped cuprates . within rpa",
    "the nematic susceptibility is maximal either at diagonal - wave vectors connecting antiferromagnetic hotspots on the fermi surface , or at the antinodal nesting wave vectors if the curvature of the fermi surface at the antinodes is sufficiently small . in order to observe this dependence on the fermi surface geometry",
    "it is crucial that the ising - nematic order parameter has a form factor with @xmath30 symmetry which depends explicitly on the fluctuation wave vector .",
    "we argued that the strong coupling between electrons and nematic fluctuations close to the antinodes reduces the electronic quasiparticle coherence and shifts the maximum of the nematic susceptibility to larger wave vectors at low temperatures .",
    "results from an eliashberg - type computation support this picture but indicate that this shift is rather small and can hardly account for the experimentally observed cdw ordering wave vectors in materials such as bi@xmath127 , where the cdw ordering wave vector is roughly twice as large as the antinodal nesting wave vector.@xcite including the effect of d - wave superconducting fluctuations potentially increases this shift of the ordering wave vector , because such fluctuations reduce the electronic spectral weight at the fermi level in the antinodal region .",
    "we leave this problem open for future study .",
    "moreover , we showed that the nematic susceptibility is maximal at zero wave vector above temperatures on the order of @xmath75 .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with experiments on underdoped cuprates , where observations of intra - unit cell nematic order have been reported below the pseudogap temperature , which is parametrically larger than reported onset - temperatures of cdw order .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the gradual onset of cdw order makes it difficult to determine such an onset - temperature and at present it is not clear if a regime with intra - unit cell nematic order exists above the onset of cdw order in the cuprates.@xcite",
    "lastly , even though the wave vectors obtained in the eliashberg calculation are in qualitative agreement with experiments on underdoped cuprates , the simple scenario of electrons close to a nematic quantum critical point clearly does nt describe the pseudogap behavior , as we do not observe a suppression of electronic spectral weight at the fermi energy in the antinodal region .",
