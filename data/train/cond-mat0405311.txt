    "in statistical physics , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations play a major role for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena , as well as ordered and disordered phases @xcite . leaving out many details of the art of computing , the broad outline of the simulation process is easily summarized . for systems both in and far from thermal equilibrium , dynamic rates @xmath0",
    "$ ] are defined which specify how a given configuration @xmath1 evolves into a new one , @xmath2 , when an update is attempted .",
    "the simulations then generate long sequences of such configurations .",
    "once initial transients have decayed , _ time - independent _ ( stationary ) observables  which will be our focus in the following  can be computed as configurational averages . for a system in thermal equilibrium , characterized by a hamiltonian @xmath3",
    ", it is well known that _ any _ choice of @xmath4 s , as long as they satisfy detailed balance with respect to @xmath5 , will generate configurations distributed according to the _ same _ boltzmann factor , @xmath6 . in other words , time - independent observables , including both universal and non - universal properties , are independent of the choice of rates , provided detailed balance holds .",
    "the resulting freedom can be exploited to design particularly efficient codes , such as cluster algorithms @xcite . in stark contrast , no such ` decoupling ' of dynamic and stationary characteristics occurs for systems driven out of equilibrium : even though non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) display time - independent observables , these are sensitive to modifications of the dynamic rates .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the violation of detailed balance which is an inherent feature of non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "while the sensitivity of ness  to the choice of the dynamics has been noted before @xcite , no systematic computational study has yet been undertaken . in this paper",
    ", we consider two models : the standard ising lattice gas and its non - equilibrium cousin , the driven ising lattice gas ( or kls model , after the initials of its inventors @xcite ) . both involve particles diffusing on a lattice , subject to an excluded volume constraint and an ( attractive ) nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the total number of particles remains conserved .",
    "for the ising lattice gas , the rates for particle hops to unoccupied nearest - neighbor sites are chosen to satisfy detailed balance , with respect to the ising hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , the driven version involves an additional external force which acts on the particles much like an electric field on ( positive ) charges : aligned with a lattice axis ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) , it favors particle hops along its direction . in conjunction with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "this bias breaks detailed balance and establishes a _ non - equilibrium _ steady state .",
    "this ness differs drastically from its equilibrium counterpart , exhibiting generic long - range correlations , a novel universality class , and highly anisotropic ordered phases @xcite .    to illustrate the importance of the transition rates for the ness , we measure structure factors and two - point spatial correlations in the driven case , using metropolis @xcite , glauber @xcite , and heat bath @xcite rates . to date",
    ", simulations of the driven model have focused almost exclusively on  metropolis rates @xcite ; other rates have only been invoked in some analytic studies @xcite . while the first two are easily implemented for conserved particle number , an appropriate generalization of heat bath rates is designed here for the first time . to avoid complications due to inhomogeneous ordered phases , we choose temperatures above or at criticality . for comparison",
    ", we also show the same quantities for the ( equilibrium ) ising model : as expected , they are found to be identical up to statistical fluctuations , and almost perfectly isotropic . in stark contrast ,",
    "when the drive is turned on , we find strongly anisotropic behavior and markedly different values for the three choices of rates . while all driven cases exhibit the signatures of long - ranged decay in real space , the correlations are much weaker for metropolis rates than for either glauber or heat bath ones .    as an additional probe into the differences between the standard ising lattice gas and its driven cousin , we construct energy histograms ( with respect to the ising hamiltonian ) for both .",
    "for the equilibrium case , these are of course intimately related to the boltzmann distribution and contain a wealth of thermodynamic information .",
    "for the driven system , they are easily measured in a simulation , but their physical interpretation has not been established yet . here , we consider a simple histogram ratio whose equilibrium limit is easily derived , and compute its non - equilibrium counterpart .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce our models and the three types of dynamics , followed by a brief discussion of our key observables .",
    "we then present our data for two - point correlations , structure factors and energy histograms .",
    "we conclude with a summary , offering a conjecture for the origin of the observed differences between the three rate functions .",
    "in this section , we introduce our two prototype models , namely , the ising lattice gas and its driven version . both are defined on an @xmath8 square lattice in two dimensions , with fully periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site @xmath9 is either occupied by a particle or empty , which we denote by a spin variable @xmath10 taking two values : @xmath11 ( occupied ) or @xmath12 ( empty ) . for the equilibrium ising model , we can specify a ( global ) hamiltonian :    @xmath13=-j\\sum_{<\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j}>}\\mathbf{\\sigma _ { i}\\,\\sigma _ { j } } ,   \\label{ising}\\ ] ]    where the sum runs over nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , and @xmath14 denotes the binding energy . in order to access the ising critical point",
    ", we consider only half - filled systems : @xmath15 .",
    "when coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath16 , the probability , @xmath17 , to find the system in configuration @xmath1 is controlled by the well - known boltzmann factor : @xmath18 with @xmath19 . here and in the following",
    ", the subscript @xmath20 will always denote equilibrium quantities .",
    "the usual technique for simulating such a distribution is to introduce a dynamics in configuration space .",
    "we choose a suitable set of transition rates , @xmath21 $ ] , which specify how a configuration @xmath1 evolves into a new one , @xmath2 , in unit time . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider transitions in which @xmath1 and @xmath22 differ by a _",
    "nearest - neighbor particle - hole exchange .",
    "now , the probability distribution , @xmath23 , becomes time - dependent and satisfies a master equation ( written , for simplicity , in continuous time ) : @xmath24p(\\sigma ^{\\prime } , t)-w[\\sigma \\rightarrow \\sigma ^{\\prime } ] p(\\sigma , t)\\right\\ }   \\label{master}\\]]its stationary solution , @xmath25 , controls all time-_independent _ properties .",
    "it is unique , under fairly generic conditions on the rates . to ensure that the desired equilibrium distribution , @xmath26 , is reproduced ,",
    "one chooses @xmath4 s which satisfy the detailed balance condition : @xmath27}{w[\\sigma ^{\\prime } \\rightarrow \\sigma ] } = \\frac{p_{0}(\\sigma ^{\\prime } ) } { p_{0}(\\sigma ) } = e^{-\\beta \\left\\ { \\mathcal{h}[\\sigma ^{\\prime } ] \\mathcal{-h}[\\sigma ] \\right\\ } }   \\label{det_bal_1}\\]]of course , this just ensures that every @xmath28 bracket in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) vanishes .",
    "an important quantity which enters here is the energy difference of two configurations , @xmath2 and @xmath1 : @xmath29\\mathcal{-h}[\\sigma ] \\label{del_h}\\]]a simple way of satisfying detailed balance is to impose rates which are functions of this difference alone : @xmath30\\equiv w(\\beta \\delta _ { 0})$ ] where the function @xmath31 must satisfy @xmath32by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ det_bal_1 ] ) but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "all three rate functions to be considered below  metropolis , glauber , and heat bath  are constructed in this way , but differ in some important details .    an obvious way of driving a system into a _",
    "non - equilibrium _ steady state is to impose rates that _ violate _ detailed balance . a prototype model that has attracted much interest due to its remarkable properties is the driven ising lattice gas ( or kls model ) @xcite .",
    "it differs from the standard ising model through the presence of an external force @xmath33 , aligned with a particular lattice axis ( the @xmath7-direction ) . when a particle attempts to jump to an empty nearest - neighbor site , it is not only affected by the local energetics , incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ ising ] ) , but also by the drive : similar to an electric field , @xmath34 favors ( suppresses ) particle hops along ( against ) the selected direction , leaving transverse exchanges unaffected . a straightforward extension of eq .",
    "( [ del_h ] ) is to include the work done by the field , i.e. , to define a _",
    "local _ ` energy ' difference of the form @xmath35\\mathcal{-h}% [ \\sigma ] -\\epsilon \\mathcal{e }   \\label{del_he}\\]]here , @xmath36 for two configurations differing only by a transverse jump , and @xmath37 @xmath38 if the particle hops along ( against ) the field in the move .",
    "we can now choose rates of the form ( [ det_bal_2 ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is essential to note that the _ combination _ of uniform drive and periodic boundary conditions _ precludes _ the existence of a _ global _",
    "hamiltonian for the driven system .",
    "a unique steady state , @xmath40 , establishes itself but can not be expressed in terms of a boltzmann factor . to maximize the non - equilibrium effects",
    ", we choose infinite @xmath34 for our simulations , i.e. , a particle will never jump against the field .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce the three choices of transition rates  metropolis , glauber , and heat bath  which will be compared in the following . for the first two choices ,",
    "the relevant quantity is the local ` energy ' difference between the _ final _ ( @xmath2 ) and the _ initial _ ( @xmath1 ) configuration . for the third choice ,",
    "the rate is independent of the initial configuration ; instead , the selection criterion involves the local energy difference of the two possible _ final _ configurations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the equilibrium ising model ,",
    "energy differences are easily computed from eq .",
    "( [ del_h ] ) , and each rate satisfies the detailed balance condition ; for the driven model , we invoke eq .",
    "( [ del_he ] ) , and detailed balance is violated .",
    "random numbers are selected uniformly from the interval @xmath41 .",
    "_ metropolis dynamics .",
    "_ for this choice of rates , we randomly select a nearest - neighbor pair @xmath9 , @xmath42 of sites with different occupanices , @xmath43 .",
    "we denote the original configuration as @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be the configuration with @xmath44 , @xmath45 switched ( i.e. , @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ) . the transition from @xmath1 to @xmath2",
    "is controlled by the metropolis rate function , @xmath48 . to be specific ,",
    "we first compute @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , the attempt ( exchange ) is accepted ;",
    "if , however , @xmath51 , we draw a random number @xmath52 and perform the exchange only if @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , energetically favorable moves are always performed while only a fraction of costly ones is accepted . as temperature increases ,",
    "this fraction approaches @xmath54 in a monotonic fashion .",
    "_ glauber dynamics . _",
    "similar to metropolis dynamics , the implementation of this algorithm involves , first , selecting two nearest - neighbor sites with different occupancies .",
    "again , @xmath2 refers to the configuration with switched occupancies .",
    "exchanges are then controlled by the glauber rate function , @xmath55 .",
    "again , we compute @xmath56 and draw a random number , @xmath52 . if @xmath57 , we accept the exchange ; otherwise , it is rejected .",
    "while energetically favorable moves are not necessarily accepted , they are always more probable than unfavorable ones .",
    "_ heat bath dynamics . _ as pointed out above , the interpretation of @xmath58 and @xmath2 is different here : these refer to the two possible final configurations of the central particle - hole pair . showing only its local neighborhood in the lattice , we define    @xmath59    for bonds along the @xmath60-axis , and @xmath61for bonds along @xmath7 ; i.e. , parallel to the drive",
    ". we also define @xmath62 in equilibrium , the heat bath algorithm is of course isotropic : for both types of bonds , we select configuration @xmath1 if a random number @xmath52 satisfies @xmath63 ; otherwise , we choose @xmath2 . for the driven case , this rule",
    "is only applied to bonds transverse to the drive ; for parallel bonds , at infinite @xmath34 , we choose configuration @xmath1 with probability @xmath64 .    to appreciate the commonalities and differences of the three algorithms , it is useful to consider a simple example with infinite drive .",
    "1 shows a central pair and a particular configuration of its six nearest neighbors . if the pair is aligned with the field direction ( figs .",
    "1a , b ) , all three dynamics generate the same outcome : each will select fig .",
    "1a as the final configuration with probability @xmath54 for any value of @xmath65 .",
    "this is not the case for bonds _ transverse _ to the field ( figs .",
    "1c , d ) . for the purposes of this argument",
    ", we choose @xmath66 .",
    "we denote the configuration shown in fig .",
    "1c ( d ) by @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the ` energy ' difference @xmath67 is easily computed from eq .",
    "( [ del_h ] ) or ( [ del_he ] ) . given a random number @xmath52",
    ", the metropolis algorithm will accept a transition from @xmath1 to @xmath2 only if @xmath68 @xmath69 , while the reverse transition ( @xmath2 to @xmath1 ) is always accepted .",
    "for glauber dynamics , the transition from @xmath58 to @xmath2 is accepted if @xmath52 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 , while the reverse transition is accepted if @xmath52 @xmath73 .",
    "finally , the heat bath algorithm will choose @xmath1 as the final state if @xmath52 @xmath74 @xmath75 , and @xmath2 otherwise .",
    "the notable differences are these : first , the metropolis algorithm accepts unfavorable moves with higher probability than either heat bath or glauber : @xmath76 @xmath77 . as a result , it is more likely to explore unphysical domains of configuration space .",
    "yet , it also accepts favorable moves with higher probability , and thus leads to a more active dynamics . comparing heat bath and glauber rates ,",
    "we note that both subdivide the unit interval into the same subsections ( @xmath72 vs @xmath75 ) .",
    "hence , they generate _ statistically _ very similar trajectories in configuration space .",
    "update by update , however , the trajectories can differ : if , e.g. , the initial configuration is @xmath1 and the random number turns out to be @xmath78 , the heat bath algorithm will choose @xmath79 as the final configuration , while the glauber rule leads to an exchange since @xmath80 .",
    "yet , we will see below that this subtle difference does not affect the data .",
    "below their critical temperatures , both the ising lattice gas and the kls model phase - segregate into regions of high and low density , by virtue of the conservation law on the number of particles .",
    "typical low - temperature configurations , for both models , show a single strip of high - density phase and its low - density mirror image . for the ising model ,",
    "the strip orients itself such as to minimize the energetic cost of interfacial length .",
    "in contrast , the low - temperature strip of the kls model is _ always _ aligned with the direction of the drive , and the minimization of interfacial length does not play a dominant role ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "a quantity which easily distinguishes disordered configurations from such inhomogeneous ones is the ( equal - time ) structure factor . written in spin language ,",
    "it is defined as @xmath81here , @xmath82 is a wave vector , taking discrete values @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for simplicity , we write @xmath86 in the following , and use @xmath87 and @xmath88 to detect strips aligned with the @xmath7- or @xmath60-axis , respectively . for a perfectly ordered strip aligned with @xmath7 , @xmath89 is maximized ; in contrast , a disordered configuration results in @xmath90 .",
    "further , the structure factor is the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function , @xmath91 , defined via @xmath92we assume translational invariance ( modulo the lattice size ) and invoke the half - filling constraint , whence @xmath93 .",
    "the same constraint imposes the sum rule @xmath94 .",
    "hence , negative values of @xmath95 for certain values of the argument should not come as a surprise .      for both the equilibrium ising model and its driven counterpart , it is straightforward to accumulate a ( normalized ) energy histogram @xmath96 , with respect to the energy function defined in eq .",
    "( [ ising ] ) . for the equilibrium ising model , @xmath97",
    "is intimately related to the boltzmann distribution : if @xmath98 denotes the density of states and @xmath99 the canonical partition function , we have    @xmath100    clearly , the right hand side is the probability @xmath101 to find the system with energy @xmath102 .",
    "the power of the histogram method @xcite resides in the observation that , up to statistical errors , a single histogram measured at temperature @xmath103 is sufficient to construct @xmath104 at all other temperatures @xmath105 : @xmath106 this allows us to compute the moments of the energy distribution as functions of temperature and extract a wealth of thermodynamic information .",
    "for the driven lattice gas , @xmath96 is easily compiled in a simulation . however , eq .  ( [ eq - hist ] )",
    "certainly does not hold for the non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "in particular , exact solutions of small systems @xcite demonstrate unambiguously that , at a given temperature , configurations with the same energy need not have the same probability . at best",

    ", we establish a few conventions and summarize the technical details of the simulations .",
    "all temperatures in the following are quoted in units of @xmath115 ; an important reference point is the onsager temperature @xmath116 @xcite which marks the critical point of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the equilibrium lattice gas and the driven system differ only in one parameter : @xmath117 vs @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "such a large value for @xmath34 suppresses ( almost ) all moves against the drive , and is therefore effectively infinite . when a quantity , e.g. , the critical temperature for the driven system , has been measured in different dynamics , we will use superscripts m ( metropolis ) , h ( heat bath ) , and g ( glauber ) to distinguish them , as in @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "the data for structure factors and two - point correlations were obtained on @xmath122 systems while the histogram simulations used a smaller system size , @xmath123 . in each case , @xmath54 mcs corresponds to one update attempt per site on average .",
    "for the larger system , each run lasted @xmath124 mcs .",
    "the first @xmath125 mcs were discarded to ensure that the system had reached steady state , and data were taken every @xmath126 mcs over the second half of the run . for better statistics ,",
    "@xmath127 independent runs were performed and averaged .",

    "the preference for horizontal interfaces is clearly seen in fig .",

    ", we observe the first glaring discrepancy between the two dynamics : the configuration generated by the heat bath algorithm is still ordered while the metropolis configuration is already disordered ! eventually , at @xmath133 , both algorithms generate disordered configurations .",
    "clearly , the two algorithms lead to _ different _ critical temperatures , with @xmath134 @xmath120 . a rough estimate based on our data @xcite results in @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "more precise estimates @xcite are available for metropolis rates only : @xmath137 .    to probe this apparent discrepancy between metropolis and heat bath rates further , and to explore the position of glauber rates in this triad , we turn to a more detailed analysis . in fig .  3 , we show surface plots of @xmath138 for the ising lattice gas ( top row , figs .",
    "3a - c ) and the driven system ( bottom row , figs .",

    "3a - c , and the data in figs .",
    "4a and b collapse within statistical error bars ( less than @xmath141 in absolute units ) .",
    "the chosen temperature , @xmath142 , is close enough to ising criticality so that lattice anisotropies are irrelevant : @xmath95 is isotropic , with circular contours centered on the origin .",
    "the small negative values observed at large distances are a consequence of the sum rule .",
    "this simple picture becomes considerably more complex when we turn to the _ driven _ system ( lower row of fig .  3 and figs .",
    "the chosen temperature , @xmath143 , is very close to our estimate for the critical temperature of heat bath and glauber rates , @xmath144 @xmath145 and about @xmath146 above @xmath119 .",
    "we immediately note the strong anisotropy induced by the drive .",
    "further , there are noticeable differences between metropolis rates on one hand , and heat bath and glauber dynamics on the other .",
    "these are most easily observed in figs .",
    "4c and d. for metropolis rates , @xmath147 is positive and decreases monotonically throughout ( fig .",
    "4c ) , while @xmath148 drops rapidly below zero , displays a minimum and then recovers and approaches zero from below .",
    "these features have been noted before @xcite , and are directly related to the breaking of detailed balance @xcite . the data for glauber and heat bath dynamics , while practically indistinguishable from one another , differ visibly from the metropolis ones .",
    "considering correlations measured along the field direction first , we observe @xmath149 for all @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "metropolis rates generate weaker correlations , consistent with the lower @xmath119 .",
    "heat bath and  glauber rates produce roughly the same correlations ; moreover , these show clear signatures of being very close to criticality , evidenced by the distinctly positive value at the largest @xmath7 shown : @xmath150 .",
    "highly correlated domains in the driven system are needle - shaped , with the needle pointing along the field , and this small , yet nonzero value indicates that some of these domains are long enough to span half the system .",
    "these precursors of ordering become even more obvious when we turn to correlations _ transverse _ to the field : the secondary maximum in fig .",
    "4d indicates a tendency towards forming thin stripes for heat bath and glauber rates .",
    "the structure factors bear out this picture .",
    "again , the independence from the rates , and the isotropy near criticality is clearly displayed by the contour plots for the equilibrium system , shown in figs .",
    "5a - c , and by the projections shown in figs .",
    "6a , b. in the driven case ( figs .",
    "5d - f and 6c , d ) , the presence of strong anisotropy is apparent , and the well - known discontinuity singularity at the origin @xcite is observed easily : @xmath151 . while these broad features characterize all three dynamics , the absolute values of the structure factors differ slightly from one another : @xmath152  is generally smaller than either @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "moreover , the distance from criticality can be measured through the discontinuity _ _  ratio _ _ ,    @xmath155which diverges as @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "our data result in @xmath157 , while @xmath158 .",
    "our findings confirm , once again , that the heat bath and glauber data are effectively much closer to criticality than those for metropolis rates .      in the final section",
    ", we turn to a brief investigation of energy histograms .",
    "since glauber and heat bath rates produce essentially identical data , we restrict ourselves in the following to just heat bath and metropolis rates . to set the scene ,",
    "we first show two histograms for the equilibrium system , generated at , and slightly above , criticality : @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( figs .",
    "7a and b , respectively ) .",
    "as expected , the data for the different dynamics collapse very well , within statistical errors .",
    "not surprisingly , the peak position shifts to higher energies with increasing temperature , while the width is largest at criticality . in fig .",
    "7c , we plot the corresponding histogram ratio , eq .",
    "( [ eq : historatio ] ) , and compare it to the predicted exponential form .",
    "the agreement is of course very good .    with fig .",
    "8 , we enter novel territory .",
    "in analogy to the equilibrium plots , figs .",
    "8a and b display the energy histograms of the driven system , at two temperatures , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , for heat bath and metropolis dynamics .",
    "the chosen temperatures correspond to criticality and slightly above for heat bath rates ; for metropolis rates , both are well inside the disordered phase .",
    "in contrast to the equilibrium case , the histograms clearly depend on the choice of rates : the peak positions are considerably higher for metropolis than for heat bath rates . at the same time , the width is largest for the system closest to criticality , i.e. , @xmath161 with heat bath rates .",
    "a comment is in order , concerning the judicious choice of the two temperatures which enter the histogram ratio .",
    "it applies to both the equilibrium and the driven case . as we can see from figs .  7 and 8",
    ", each histogram displays a well - developed peak .",
    "energies far away from the peak position occur rarely , so that histograms are plagued by large statistical errors in those regions . in order to yield a reliable ratio",
    ", the corresponding histograms should overlap in their statistically meaningful domains .",
    "hence , the two chosen temperatures must not lie too far apart .    in fig .",
    "8c , we present the histogram ratio for the driven system . for each dynamics ,",
    "two temperatures close to their respective critical temperatures were chosen : @xmath163 and @xmath164 for metropolis rates , and @xmath165 and @xmath166 for heat bath rates .",
    "remarkably , we observe that the histogram ratio for both is again a simple exponential , i.e. , @xmath167 , at least over the range shown . in stark contrast to the equilibrium case",
    ", there is no a priori reason here to expect such behavior .",
    "instead , it indicates that @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ dds - historatio ] ) depends sufficiently smoothly on @xmath102 as to allow an expansion in @xmath168 :    @xmath169 + o(\\delta ^{2 } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & -\\alpha \\delta + o(\\delta ^{2 } )   \\label{lin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , the slope of the data in fig .",
    "8c allows us to probe @xmath170 , as a function of temperature and dynamics .",
    "it manifestly differs from the equilibrium form @xmath171 .",
    "a more systematic study is required to extract , and interpret , its properties .",
    "we have simulated the equilibrium ising lattice gas and its driven non - equilibrium counterpart , using three different dynamics : metropolis , glauber and heat bath . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "all three rate functions satisfy detailed balance with respect to the ising hamiltonian ; as a consequence , all stationary ( time - independent ) equilibrium quantities are expected to be independent of the choice of the dynamics .",
    "apart from unavoidable statistical errors , our equilibrium data are of course perfectly consistent with this expectation . for the driven system , this is no longer the case : due to the drive , all three rate functions violate detailed balance , and the ` decoupling ' of stationary properties from the chosen dynamics no longer holds .",
    "measuring two - point correlations and structure factors in the disordered phase , we observe distinct differences between the three dynamics . on the one hand ,",
    "metropolis rates lead to a lower critical temperature , and hence generally weaker correlations in the disordered phase , than either glauber or heat bath rates . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter two generate practically indistinguishable data .",
    "these features can be understood in terms of a few basic properties of the three rates : at a given temperature , metropolis rates tend to accept all moves with a somewhat higher probability than the other two rate functions . in other words , a system which evolves under the metropolis algorithm",
    "` sees ' an effectively higher temperature than if it were running under heat bath or glauber . a similar observation was made recently for field - driven ising or solid - on - solid interfaces , subject to glauber and metropolis dynamics : there , metropolis rates appear to lead to rougher interfaces and higher propagation velocities than glauber rates @xcite . in contrast , heat bath and glauber rates partition the unit interval into the same subsections and accept / reject moves according to this partition . as a result",
    ", they generate statistically indistinguishable trajectories in configuration space , leading to essentially identical data .",
    "it is essential to note , however , that the _ broad characteristics _ , associated with the breaking of detailed balance , are clearly observed in all three dynamics : all structure factors show the typical discontinuity singularity at the origin which , in turn , translates into power law decays of the two - point correlation functions . to summarize ,",
    "_ universal _",
    "features , associated with _ global _ symmetries , remain independent of _ local _ changes of dynamic rules , both near and far from equilibrium .    in a second part of this paper",
    ", we discuss the energy histograms @xmath172 associated with our two models , generated by heat bath and metropolis dynamics . for the equilibrium system , the independence of the choice of dynamics is borne out again , while differences emerge in the driven case .",
    "a simple ratio , @xmath173 , constructed from two histograms measured at different temperatures @xmath174 and @xmath110 , allows us to probe their functional form for a specified dynamics . in equilibrium",
    ", the canonical distribution prescribes a simple exponential dependence , @xmath175 .",
    "remarkably , its non - equilibrium counterpart @xmath176 is _ also _ exponential in @xmath177 .",
    "this behavior indicates a smooth dependence of @xmath178 on @xmath102 , allowing us to linearize @xmath179 in @xmath177 .",
    "the slope of the resulting straight line depends on the dynamics and probes the derivative @xmath180 .",
    "further , and more detailed , studies of this type may reveal some of the hidden `` thermodynamics '' of this remarkably complex non - equilibrium steady state .",
