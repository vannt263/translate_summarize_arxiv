    "( [ eq : s3 ] ) , in order to calculate the spatial shift at the interface ( x=0 ) , we need to know the reflection phase @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath146 represents the incident angle of the wave packet , and can be easily obtained once we know the incident wave vector .",
    "next , we elaborate on deriving the reflection phase @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the total reflection case , i.e. , the reflection probability @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the wave function must be evanescent in the region @xmath5[fig .",
    "2(a ) ] . we can calculate the reflection coefficient by matching the wave function @xmath148 at @xmath10 to the evanescent wave .",

    "to clarify this idea , we consider a system with a model hamiltonian @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are two parameters .",
    "the eigenenergy of the hamiltonian is @xmath156 .",
    "thus this hamiltonian obviously does not have 3d linearized energy dispersions .",
    "one can apply a gate voltage @xmath49 to this system at the region @xmath157 ; therefore , an interface appears at @xmath10 .",
    "we now consider that a wave packet incidents on the interface from the region @xmath11 . to calculate the if shift at the interface",
    ", we follow the same procedure in the main text .",
    "analogously , we first construct the incident wave packet in gaussian profile with center momentum @xmath15 .",
    "still we assume the wave packet as @xmath158 , where @xmath159 has the same definition as in the main text .",
    "similarly , the reflected wave packet can be constructed as @xmath160 . however , since the hamiltonian @xmath161 here is different from that in the main text , one need to solve the wave functions @xmath17 and @xmath162 for @xmath161 .",
    "the hamiltonian equation is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a two components spinor .",
    "solve this hamiltonian equation and use continuity condition of the wave function at @xmath10 , then we can get the solutions : @xmath165 and @xmath166 in the above expressions , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath27 is the reflection amplitude , and @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "substitute @xmath35 and @xmath152 into eq.([eq : s3 ] ) , and one can obtain the spatial shifts in @xmath30 and @xmath31-directions .",
    "if the incident wave packet is confined in @xmath36-@xmath30 plane , then the out - of - plane spatial shift in @xmath31-direction corresponds to the if shift and reads : @xmath173    alternatively , one can also obtain the if shift @xmath40 from semiclassical equation for wave packet ( eq.(7 ) in the main text ) . in order to apply the semiclassical equation , one need calculate the berry curvature @xmath174 for the hamiltonian @xmath161 , where the superscript @xmath139 corresponds to the conductance band and valence band , respectively .",
    "the berry curvature of this system is @xmath175@xcite .",
    "substitute the berry curvature expression into the eq.(11 ) in the main text , and one can obtain the analytic result of the if shift @xmath176 , showing the consistence with eq.([eq : s7 ] ) . the fact that the if shift @xmath40 can be obtained from eq.(7 ) in the main text provides another convincing argument that if shift arises from the berry curvature of the system .          in the main text ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the gh shift does not depend on valley index , whereas the if shift depends on valley index .",
    "although both of the gh shift and if shift can bring anomalous velocities to the normal velocities , only the anomalous velocity induced by if shift is valley - dependent .",
    "there are both gh and if shifts at the left interface ( @xmath178 ) and the right interface ( @xmath179 ) . if the system has the mirror symmetry about the @xmath10 plane , the gh shifts are in the same direction at the left and right interfaces .",
    "but if shifts are in opposite direction at these two interfaces , leading to the cancellation of the if shifts after two subsequent reflections . therefore , in order to observe the valley - dependent if shift , the mirror symmetry about @xmath10 plane need to be broken .",
    "so we consider that the z direction velocities in the three regions are unequal , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . for simplicity ,",
    "the x and y directions velocities are still with @xmath88 .",
    "figure s1 shows the anomalous velocities induced by the gh shift and if shift .",
    "the anomalous velocities are calculated with the same parameters as in the section  _ anomalous velocities induced by if effect _ \" in the main text .",
    "as one can see , the anomalous velocity induced by the gh shift is valley - independent ; by contrast , the anomalous velocity induced by the if shift is valley - dependent .",
    "the green curves and red curves correspond to valley a and valley b , respectively .",
    "the thick curves and dashed curves correspond to the anomalous velocities in y - direction and z - direction , respectively .    given the incident direction @xmath180 of the incident wave packet , we can calculate the final position @xmath181 at bottom of the region .",
    "the wave packet needs time @xmath182 to reach to the bottom of the region without considering anomalous velocity .",
    "however , if we take the anomalous velocity into account , the wave packet needs time @xmath183 to reach to the bottom of the region .",
    "thus the anomalous velocities induced position shift is @xmath184 put the total velocities of the valley a and valley b into eq.([eq : s81 ] ) , we can get the final position shifts for the valley a and valley b , respectively [ see fig .",
    "3(d ) in the main text ] .          since the incident wave packets are likely to be reflected repeatedly at two interfaces , one only needs to consider the total reflected cases since the partially reflected wave packets would eventually diminish after being reflected multiple times .",
    "a collimated incident wave packet usually has certain angle range , thus , we assume @xmath186 $ ] and @xmath187 $ ] , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the angles of the center of the collimated incident wave packet and the @xmath113 is the angle spread range . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we take @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in this case , the anomalous velocity @xmath190 induced by the gh effect is negative , and the anomalous velocity induced by the if shift is relatively large .",
    "hence , the total anomalous velocity has a remarkable valley - dependent effect .    for a wave packet of weyl fermions propagating in the region , the total velocities in @xmath30 , @xmath31 directions are @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "due to the valley - dependent anomalous velocities , the total velocities are also valley - dependent , which can lead to macroscopic shifts of valleys . because of the reflection at the two interfaces ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , the velocity in x direction @xmath193 in the region is a periodic function of @xmath194 , i.e. , @xmath195 . in the first period",
    ", the velocity @xmath196 reads @xmath197\\\\ -v_x   & t \\in [ \\frac{\\delta t}{2},\\frac{3\\delta t}{2})\\end{array}\\right .. \\ ] ] the height of this structure is @xmath82 , thus the wave packet needs time @xmath198 to reach to the bottom of the region .",
    "hence , one can get the final position coordinate @xmath181 of the wave packet , where @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 .",
    "as one can see , a single incident direction @xmath180 of the wave packet corresponds to a single point @xmath181 at the bottom of region .",
    "we further assume that the injector supplies an equal strength of incident beams in the angle range @xmath202 $ ] and @xmath203 $ ] .",
    "thus , there will be a pattern ( density distribution ) at the bottom of region [ see fig .",
    "4(d ) in the main text ] .",
    "the figure s2 ( a ) and ( b ) show the density distribution of valley a and valley b , respectively , before considering the if shift . from the figure s1(a ) and ( b ) we can find that the density distribution of valley a and valley b are located at the same place .",
    "therefore , the weyl fermions from valley a and valley b are mixed together . however ,",
    "if the anomalous velocity is taken into account , the distribution of valley a and valley b will shift to opposite direction leading to the valley separation [ as shown in fig .",

    "<S> _ _ detection of berry curvature.__the berry curvature a gauge invariant quantity  should be detectable in experiment@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , up to date , there lacks an experimental feasible method to measure the berry curvature in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> the topological if effect provides a new way to measure the berry curvature . for a system with inversion symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the berry curvature is an even function of wave vector @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath121@xcite , which is usually satisfied in wsms@xcite . considering a wave packet propagating in @xmath36-@xmath30 plane with @xmath122 , </S>",
    "<S> the if shift can be expressed as @xmath123 , or @xmath124 to measure the berry curvature @xmath76 , one need to collect the if shift in @xmath31 direction @xmath125 as a function of energy @xmath48 and incidence angle @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath126 can be transformed into @xmath127 , and its derivative gives out the berry curvature @xmath128 . in the same way , the if shift in other directions can be used to obtain @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ summary.__we obtained analytical expressions of the gh shift and if shift at the interface of wsms . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the if shift is valley - dependent , and can be attributed to the topological nature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this if shift can lead to valley - dependent anomalous velocity , which is experimentally detectable . finally , we discuss three applications of the topological if shift including characterization of wsms , fabrication of high efficient valleytronic devices , and detection the berry curvature .    _ </S>",
