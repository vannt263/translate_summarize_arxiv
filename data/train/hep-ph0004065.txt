    "the unitarity of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix within the ordinary quark sector is violated , and the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) appear at the tree - level @xcite . these flavor changing interactions are actually described in terms of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing parameters and the quark masses , as seen in detail in the text .",
    "this may be viewed as an interesting extension of the natural flavor conservation proposed in the early literature @xcite .",

    "this issue will be addressed in the following by inspecting systematically the form of quark mass matrix @xmath30 and its diagonalization .",

    "@xmath48 is , however , maintained by these transformations of the ordinary quarks . in this basis , by turning off the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing with @xmath54 , the quark fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 are reduced to the mass eigenstates , and @xmath18 is identified with the ckm matrix . the actual ckm matrix @xmath57 is slightly modified from @xmath18 by the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing , as shown explicitly later .",
    "it should be noticed that the quark transformations made so far to specify the form of @xmath30 do not mix the electroweak doublets with the singlets , respecting the @xmath14 gauge symmetry .",
    "hence , without loss of generality we may have two appropriate choices of the quark basis for the electroweak eigenstates : @xmath58 in either case , with the diagonal @xmath49 coupling we have the submatrix of @xmath30 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 as seen from eq .",
