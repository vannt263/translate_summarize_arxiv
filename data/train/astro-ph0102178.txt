    "accreting neutron stars fall generally into two classes ( see white , nagase , & parmar 1995 ) .",
    "those in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are x - ray pulsars , with dipole magnetic fields @xmath10 , large enough to disrupt the accretion flow and channel it onto the polar caps .",
    "most of the neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , however , show no direct evidence for a magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) . the accretion disk is believed to extend almost to the stellar surface , allowing these neutron stars to be spun up to millisecond periods by accretion .",
    "thus lmxb neutron stars are favored candidates for the progenitors of millisecond radio pulsars ( bhattacharya 1995 ) , and as such are expected to have magnetic fields @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "only one lmxb so far has shown a pulse indicative of magnetically - controlled accretion , the newly - discovered transient sax  j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "this source shows persistent 401 hz pulsations , making it the first accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsar ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) . interpreting the pulsations as disruption of",
    "the accretion flow by a magnetosphere leads to an estimated magnetic field strength of @xmath14@xmath13 ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , suggesting that this source will become a millisecond radio pulsar once accretion ceases ( bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "the origin of such low external magnetic fields @xmath15 is not understood , but is believed to be directly connected with accretion of matter onto the neutron star .",
    "this suggestion is based on the observations that isolated neutron stars show no evidence for dramatic field decay , and that low field radio pulsars occur almost exclusively in binaries ( bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 ) . utilizing binary evolution calculations ,",
    "taam & van den heuvel ( 1986 ) studied a number of systems , finding that magnetic field strength decreases with the amount of accreted matter , although wijers ( 1997 ) argues against this interpretation .",
    "a number of different mechanisms for achieving this reduction in magnetic field strength have been proposed ( see bhattacharya & srinivasan 1995 for a review ) .",
    "one possibility that could explain the low dipole fields and the lack of pulsations from these sources is that the external dipole magnetic field is `` buried '' or `` screened '' by the accreted matter .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg ( 1974 ) suggested that pulsars in binaries may have low magnetic fields because of this effect .",
    "romani ( 1990 , 1995 ) outlined a picture in which matter initially accretes onto the polar cap , eventually spreads under the weight of the accumulated matter , and advects magnetic field inwards .",
    "he proposed that the magnetic flux would be trapped in the crust and screened by further accretion of diamagnetic matter .    in this paper , we test this possibility . we consider accretion of unmagnetized matter onto a neutron star with a buried magnetic field , and ask whether the field remains buried , or whether the newly accreted material becomes magnetized faster than the rate at which it is accreted , allowing the intrinsic stellar field to `` leak out '' .",
    "we study the competition between downwards compression and advection by accretion at the local rate , @xmath16 , and upwards ohmic diffusion .",
    "we carry out this calculation for the ocean and outer crust of the neutron star that are in steady - state once accretion has been occurring for an extended period .",
    "we show that , in steady - state , the magnetic field strength decreases through the outer crust and ocean by @xmath17 orders of magnitude , where @xmath18 is the eddington accretion rate .",
    "we show that these profiles are unstable to buoyancy instabilities in the ocean when @xmath19@xmath6 , giving a new limit to the strength of any buried field .",
    "we find that screening could be effective at the accretion rates of most steadily accreting neutron stars .",
    "unfortunately , because of the simplified magnetic field and accretion geometry we adopt in this paper , we can not definitively state that these objects have a screened field . however , if so , we show that after accretion ceases , we expect the dipole field to emerge on a timescale of 1001000 years , set by the ohmic diffusion time across the outer crust .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that screening alone can explain the low magnetic fields of the millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "our robust conclusion is that it is not possible to diamagnetically screen the field in the crust for accretion rates @xmath20 .",
    "the lack of screening at low accretion rates may explain why sax  j1808.4 - 3658 is the only lmxb so far to show persistent pulsations .",
    "consideration of both the observations and evolutionary state of this binary ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ; bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) makes it clear that the time - averaged accretion rate is unusually low , @xmath21 , far below the realm where screening can occur .",
    "previous authors have considered the competition between accretion and ohmic diffusion , but in different contexts .",
    "brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) compared the ohmic diffusion and advection times in the atmosphere , ocean and crust of the polar cap of an accreting x - ray pulsar . in this case , the accreted matter arrives on the star already threaded by the magnetic field , and may spread laterally if ohmic diffusion is rapid enough . considering magnetic field evolution in accreting neutron stars , konar & bhattacharya ( 1997 ) assumed that the currents supporting the magnetic field were confined to the crust , and calculated the competing effects of ohmic dissipation , and advection of magnetic flux into denser regions with longer dissipation times ( and eventually into the superconducting core ) .",
    "another process which acts to transport magnetic flux outwards is thermomagnetic drift ( e.g. , urpin & yakovlev 1980 ; geppert & urpin 1994 ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the liquid ocean and solid crust of the neutron star , for which we find that thermomagnetic drift is unimportant ; the magnetic field profile is set by the competition between ohmic diffusion and accretion .",
    "however , in the h / he layer which overlies the ocean , we find that thermomagnetic drift dominates the transport of magnetic field .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field in this layer , which periodically undergoes a thermonuclear instability giving rise to type i x - ray bursts , will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "we start by describing the thermal structure of the ocean and crust , and what sets the electrical conductivity there (  2 ) . in  3 , we discuss the evolution of the magnetic field under the joint action of accretion and ohmic diffusion , and in  4 evaluate the characteristic timescales for these processes . in  5 ,",
    "we compute steady state magnetic profiles .",
    "we show that the magnetic field decreases with height in the ocean , by an amount that depends strongly on the local accretion rate , @xmath16 . in  6 , we consider the stability of the steady - state profiles to magnetic buoyancy instabilities .",
    "we summarize our results and conclude in  7 with the implications for steadily and transiently accreting neutron stars .",
    "in this section , we outline the structure of the outer layers of the neutron star , and describe how we calculate the electrical conductivity .      most neutron stars in lmxbs accrete hydrogen and helium from their companions at rates @xmath22 .",
    "since we are concerned with the outermost layers of thickness @xmath23 , small compared to the radius , we adopt plane parallel coordinates and measure the accretion rate as a local rate @xmath16 ( units @xmath24 ) . the local eddington accretion rate is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath27 is the proton mass , @xmath28 is the speed of light , @xmath29 is the stellar radius , and @xmath30 is the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "we use the eddington accretion rate for solar composition ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32  km , @xmath33 , as our basic unit for the local accretion rate . for a 10 km neutron star",
    ", this corresponds to a global rate @xmath34 .",
    "the neutron star atmosphere is in hydrostatic balance as the accreted hydrogen and helium accumulates , because the downward flow speed ( @xmath35 ) is much less than the sound speed @xmath36 .",
    "the pressure varies with height as @xmath37 , where the gravitational acceleration @xmath38 is constant in the thin envelope .",
    "we assume in this paper that the magnetic field does not play a role in hydrostatic balance , i.e. @xmath39 ( we check this assumption in  6 when we consider buoyancy instabilities ) .",
    "a useful variable is the column depth @xmath40 ( units g @xmath41 ) , defined by @xmath42 , giving @xmath43 .",
    "as the matter accumulates , a given fluid element moves to greater and greater column depth .",

    "the microphysics of these layers has been discussed by bildsten & cutler ( 1995 ) and brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) .",
    "the pressure in the ocean and outer crust is mostly provided by degenerate electrons . for the ions , we incorporate coulomb corrections to the equation of state using the fit of farouki & hamaguchi ( 1993 ) .",
    "the crystallization point is determined by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the interion spacing given by @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the ionic charge , @xmath55 is the ion number density ( we assume only one species of ion is present ) . for typical conditions at top of the ocean , this is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the mass of each nucleus is @xmath59 .",
    "the ions solidify when @xmath60 ( farouki & hamaguchi 1993 ) , at a depth @xmath61 where we assume fully - relativistic electrons and use the @xmath62 fermi energy .",
    "we find the thermal structure of the ocean and crust by integrating the heat equation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the outward heat flux , and @xmath65 is the opacity .",
    "the heat flux is set by heat released from compression of matter by accretion , and from pycnonuclear reactions and electron captures deep in the crust ( brown & bildsten 1998 ) . for our models , we assume a constant heat flux @xmath66 per nucleon .",

    "( 1999 ) and brown ( 2000 ) for the crust ( see discussion in  2.2 ) .",

    ", we mark the liquid - solid interface with a dot ( the @xmath18 model is still liquid at @xmath78 ) . in the crust",
    ", we show two models for each accretion rate , each with a different choice for the thermal conductivity : phonon scattering or electron - ion scattering ( see  2.2 for discussion of conductivity in the crust ) .      in the relaxation time approximation ,",
    "the electrical conductivity is @xmath79 , or @xmath80 ( e.g. , ziman 1964 ; yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) , where @xmath81 is the electron number density , @xmath82 is the effective electron mass , @xmath83 is the mean molecular weight per electron , and @xmath84 is the electron collision frequency .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : magprof ] shows the conductivity as a function of depth .",
    "in the liquid ocean , electron - ion collisions set the electrical conductivity .",
    "we use the results of yakovlev & urpin ( 1980 ) , who give @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath87 measures the electron fermi momentum @xmath88 .",

    "the other contribution to the conductivity is scattering with phonons , for which we adopt the results of baiko & yakovlev ( 1995 ) . for temperatures much greater than the debye temperature ( @xmath95 ) , they find @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath98 is of order unity",
    ". the ratio of the impurity and phonon scattering frequencies is @xmath99 where we choose typical conditions in the crust .",
    "previous studies have assumed a low level of impurity , @xmath100 , as might be expected for a primordial crust . in this case",
    "phonon scattering dominates the conductivity .",
    "however , recent calculations of the products of h / he burning in the atmosphere show that the impurity level is probably much greater .",
    "schatz et al .  (",
    "1999 ) calculated the ashes of steady - state h / he burning at local accretion rates @xmath101 , and found @xmath102 and @xmath103 . at such high impurity factors ,",
    "it is not clear whether equation ( [ eq : nueq ] ) is correct .",
    "brown ( 2000 ) suggests that when @xmath104 , the appropriate conductivity is that for electron - ion scattering in the liquid .    in this paper ,",
    "we show results for two limiting cases for the crust : a pure crust with only phonon scattering , and an impure crust with electron - ion scattering calculated as for the liquid . the conductivity in each case",
    "is shown in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "for each accretion rate , we plot the two solutions for the crust : for electron - ion scattering , the conductivity is continuous across the liquid - solid boundary ; for phonon scattering , the conductivity changes discontinuously .",
    "the difference in conductivity between these two cases is roughly a factor of 5 . in  4 , we show that the impurity level has an important effect on magnetic field evolution in the outer crust .",
    "we consider a simplified geometry for the magnetic field , a plane parallel model in which the magnetic field @xmath105 depends only on depth . in this case , the vertical component of the magnetic field must be constant since @xmath106 , and we set it equal to zero since we assume the accreted matter is unmagnetized .",
    "this leaves us with a purely horizontal field , @xmath107 ( we align our @xmath108-axis with the horizontal component of the field ) .",
    "the magnetic field evolves according to faraday s law @xmath109 where the electric field @xmath110 is given by ohm s law , @xmath111 the electric current is @xmath112 for a given profile @xmath113 , and the downwards flow velocity is given by continuity as @xmath114 ( we define @xmath115 so that it is a positive quantity for the downwards flow ) .",

    "it is instructive to rewrite equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the advective derivative and we have used the continuity equation @xmath123 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : advect ] ) clearly illustrates the different processes acting to change the magnitude of @xmath124 .",
    "the left hand side describes advection and compression by the downwards flow ; the right hand side describes ohmic diffusion . without diffusion ,",
    "@xmath124 in a given fluid element would grow @xmath125 as it was compressed .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate only steady state solutions of equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) .",
    "since we assume that the incoming material is unmagnetized , we set @xmath126 , and equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) reduces to @xmath127 we rewrite this so that pressure is the independent variable ; this makes the competition between advection and diffusion more transparent .",
    "using hydrostatic balance , and introducing the pressure scale height @xmath128 , equation ( [ induction ] ) becomes @xmath129 where we have defined @xmath130 the characteristic ohmic diffusion time across a scale height , and @xmath131 the characteristic accretion flow time across a pressure scale height .",
    "equation ( [ ss ] ) shows that , in steady - state , @xmath132 measures the ratio of pressure scale height to magnetic scale height . for example , if @xmath133 , a small magnetic scale height is required for ohmic diffusion to balance accretion .    the magnetic profile is given by integrating equation ( [ ss ] ) , since all the quantities on the right hand side are known functions of pressure ( or height ) .",

    "the ohmic diffusion time is independent of @xmath124 ( see goldreich & reisenegger 1992 for an interesting discussion ) .",
    "thus equation ( [ ss ] ) is linear in @xmath124 , giving the profile of the magnetic field independent of its overall amplitude . in the field burial picture ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath124 in the crust is fixed by conserving the magnetic flux in the original dipole field .",
    "we do not calculate the details of the burial process in this paper ; thus we treat the overall normalization of the magnetic field in the crust as a free parameter .    for our assumed field geometry ,",
    "the hall term in ohm s law exactly vanishes . more generally , the magnitude of the hall term depends on the ratio of the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath138 , to the electron collision frequency , @xmath139 . for a typical value of @xmath84 ,",
    "this is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the effective mass of the electron .",
    "typically , @xmath142 requires @xmath143 in the ocean and crust ; we show in  [ sec : stability ] that such large fields are buoyantly unstable .",
    "in addition , we neglect terms in ohm s law due to thermomagnetic effects ( e.g. , urpin & yakovlev 1980 ) ; these are unimportant in the ocean and outer crust .",
    "in  [ sec : evol ] , we showed that the steady - state magnetic profile depends directly on the ratio of accretion and ohmic diffusion timescales . in this section",
    ", we evaluate this ratio , before presenting the steady - state profiles in  [ sec : steady ] .",
    "figure [ fig : magtimes ] shows the accretion and diffusion timescales as a function of depth , and figure [ fig : ratio ] shows @xmath132 .",
    "we find that the diffusion time is longer than accretion time for @xmath144 .",
    "we now use simple analytic estimates to understand these results , discussing the ocean (  [ sec : diff1 ] ) and crust (  [ sec : diff3 ] ) in turn .",
    "first , we evaluate @xmath145 .",
    "the conductivity is given by equation ( [ eq : yusigma ] ) .",
    "the degenerate electron pressure is @xmath146 ( clayton 1983 ) , or , in terms of column depth @xmath147 , @xmath148 where @xmath149 ( clayton 1983 ) , and @xmath150 .",
    "we write the density as @xmath151 , giving @xmath152 .",

    "the total screening factor @xmath137 through the ocean is thus insensitive to the upper and lower boundaries .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath170 occurs for intermediate values of @xmath40 , for which the electrons are partially relativistic ( @xmath171 , @xmath172@xmath173 ) .",
    "we now turn to the solid crust .",
    "the behavior of @xmath169 is quite different in the crust , depending on whether we choose electron - ion scattering or phonon scattering . for electron - ion scattering , @xmath174 , decreasing with depth , as shown in figure [ fig : ratio ] . for phonon scattering , @xmath175 giving @xmath176 thus @xmath170 is constant with depth in this case , in agreement with figure [ fig : ratio ] . we see that , as suggested by schatz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath177 is much smaller in an impure crust ( electron - ion scattering ) than a primordial crust ( phonon scattering ) .    we do not calculate the conductivity of the inner crust , below neutron drip at @xmath178@xmath179 . at these depths ,",
    "brown & bildsten ( 1998 ) found that @xmath180 for @xmath181 ( see their figure 9 for a continuation of our figure 3 into the inner crust ) . thus the inner crust does not give a significant contribution to the screening factor .",

    "we do not expect buoyancy instability to operate in the crust , as long as the rigidity of the crust is able to counteract the buoyancy force .",
    "the detailed outcome of the instability will depend on its non - linear development .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to take the critical magnetic field of equation ( [ eq : bcprime ] ) as an upper limit on the strength of any buried field at the boundary between the ocean and crust .",
    "we have investigated whether the magnetic field of a lmxb neutron star may be diamagnetically screened by the accreted matter .",
    "the magnetic profile in the outer layers is set by the competition between downwards advection and compression by accretion , and upwards transport by ohmic diffusion . in steady - state",
    ", we have shown that the magnetic field strength decreases through the outer crust and ocean by @xmath3 orders of magnitude , where @xmath230 ( see  [ sec : steady ] ) .",
    "the steady - state profiles are stable to buoyancy instabilities provided the magnetic field in the ocean and crust is @xmath231@xmath6 .",
    "our results are summarized in figure [ fig : bplot ] . arbitrarily choosing @xmath232 at the crust / ocean boundary , we plot the magnetic field at the surface of the ocean for different accretion rates . at large accretion rates ,",
    "the magnetic field strength decreases dramatically through the ocean , and the stellar field is screened by the accreted layer . at low accretion rates , the magnetic field penetrates into the accreted layer , and screening is ineffective .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines in figure [ fig : bplot ] show , with and without thermal diffusion ( see  [ sec : stability ] for the physics of this difference ) , the critical magnetic field needed at the top of the crust for magnetic buoyancy instability to occur in the ocean .",
    "this provides an upper limit to the strength of any buried field , since , for larger field strengths , we expect additional upwards transport of magnetic flux by buoyancy instabilities .",
    "we have shown that for accretion rates @xmath233 , microscopic ohmic diffusion prevents screening of the neutron star magnetic field by the accreted matter . at larger accretion rates ,",
    "field burial may be possible ; however , we stress that we have considered only a plane - parallel model with a simple field geometry . for example , consideration of a more complex field geometry in a spherical shell may indicate that additional modes of magnetic instability are available .",
    "in addition , the burial process itself is not well - understood although some calculations of the spreading of matter initially confined to the polar cap of a strongly magnetized neutron star with @xmath10 have been carried out ( hameury et al .",
    "1983 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ; litwin , brown , & rosner 2001 ) .    our results may explain why sax j1808.4 - 3658 is the only known lmxb to show pulsations in its persistent emission ( upper limits to the pulsed fraction in other sources are @xmath234% ; leahy , elsner & weisskopf 1983 ; mereghetti & grindlay 1987 ; wood et al .  1991 ; vaughan et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this source has similar x - ray spectral and variability properties to other lmxbs ( van der klis 2000 , and references therein ) , but has an unusually low accretion rate .",
    "the time - averaged accretion rate is @xmath235 ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ; bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) , and at the peak of outburst reaches @xmath236 .",
    "this accretion rate is similar to that at which we expect screening to become ineffective .",
    "this leads us to suggest that perhaps most lmxbs have their dipole magnetic fields screened by the accreted matter , whereas sax j1808.4 - 3658 accretes slowly enough that the magnetic field is able to rapidly penetrate the freshly - accreted material .",
    "the other faint galactic center transients discovered with bepposax ( e.g. , king 2000 ) may therefore be promising sources to search for persistent pulsations .",
    "we have concentrated on the steady - state magnetic field profiles .",
    "however , there may be important time - dependent evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , if the magnetic field is screened , then we expect it to emerge once accretion ceases .",
    "the timescale for this depends on the depth of the screening currents ( young & chanmugam 1995 ) . for the inner crust ,",
    "the ohmic diffusion time is @xmath237@xmath238 years , always less than the accretion time ( see figure 9 of brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "thus we expect the relevant timescale to be the ohmic time across the outer crust , which is extremely short , only 1001000 years .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that screening alone can explain the low magnetic fields of the millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "potentially observable time - dependent effects may occur in those transiently - accreting systems whose accretion rate during outburst is large enough for screening to be important . after an outburst , we would expect the magnetic field profile to relax by ohmic diffusion on a timescale comparable to the outburst duration .",
    "our results show that evolution of magnetic field in the outer crust is sensitive to the level of impurity there , as suggested by schatz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for a primordial crust with a low level of impurity , as assumed by previous workers , phonon scattering dominates the conductivity .",
    "however , as shown by recent calculations of nucleosynthesis during h / he burning in the atmosphere ( schatz et al .  1998 , 1999 ; koike et al .",
    "1999 ) , the crust is likely very impure . in this case , the conductivity is set by scattering from ions , leading to shorter ohmic dissipation times than previously assumed .",
    "we have not discussed the layer of h / he that lies above the ocean .",
    "because of the different composition , the ohmic diffusion time in this layer is longer than that in the ocean .",
    "however , we find that the magnetic profile in this layer is determined by a different process , thermomagnetic drift ( urpin & yakovlev 1980 ) driven by the heat flux from nuclear burning .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field in this layer is important for understanding type i x - ray bursts .",
    "in particular , the drifting oscillations observed during bursts with rxte ( see strohmayer 1999 and van der klis 2000 for reviews ) have been interpreted as due to a differentially rotating atmosphere .",
    "however , cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) pointed out that a poloidal field @xmath239 is large enough to prevent differential rotation .",
    "type i x - ray bursts are thus promising probes of the magnetic field in the surface layers .",
    "we address magnetic field evolution in the h / he layers in a separate paper .",
