    "relativistic jets are common in the astrophysical environment . objects known or suspected to produce them include radio galaxies and quasars @xcite , microquasars @xcite and gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "an important difference between jets of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and the better studied radio jets of quasars or microquasars is that active quasars often inject energy over extended periods of time into the jet while grb sources are impulsive .",
    "although quasar jets remain highly collimated throughout their lifetimes , grb jets decelerate and expand significantly once they become nonrelativistic .",
    "expansion into a uniform medium has been well studied @xcite , but the interaction of a grb remnant with a nonuniform medium remains poorly understood .",
    "much of our effort in this paper is therefore dedicated to determining how the morphology and dynamics of young grb remnants is modified by the character of the circumburst medium .",
    "some of the questions at the forefront of attention include the effects of the external medium and the degree to which grb remnant dynamics and structures are modified by the presence of an accompanying supernova .",
    "we address both of these issues here .",
    "because massive stars are expected to have their close - in surroundings modified by the progenitor winds , we consider both free winds and shocked winds as possible surrounding media for the grb remnant evolution .",

    "discussion and conclusions are presented in  [ dis ] .",
    "for simplicity , lets consider a uniform grb jet with sharp edges and a half - opening angle @xmath0 , with an initial value of @xmath1 .",
    "the typical angular size , @xmath2 , of the jet at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time at which the jet s lorentz factor @xmath5 drops to @xmath6 , is the same as for a spherical flow : @xmath7 for an external density profile @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is the _ true _ kinetic energy content of the jet , and @xmath10 is the isotropic equivalent energy where @xmath11 is the beaming factor . at these early times ,",
    "the flow is described by the blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) self - similar solution , which provides an accurate expression for the temporal evolution of the observed image size : @xmath12 for constant density medium ( @xmath13 ) with @xmath14 @xmath15 ( @xmath16 g @xmath15 ) , and @xmath17 for a stellar wind environment ( @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 g @xmath20 .",
    "notice that even in the most optimistic cases , the characteristic size of a grb image is only of order 1 @xmath21 as about a day after the grb at the hubble distance @xcite , and so it can not be resolved by existing telescopes .",
    "obviously , the challenge is made easier for nearby sources , where the late size of the observable remnant could extend over a wide , possibly resolvable angle @xcite . at late times",
    "@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nonrelativistic transition time , the jet is expected to gradually approach the sedov - taylor self - similar solution , asymptotically reaching @xmath24 . at @xmath25",
    "there is , however , a large uncertainty in the hydrodynamic evolution of the jet , and in particular in its rate of sideways expansion .    to illustrate the importance of sideways expansion on the evolution of the observed image ,",
    "lets consider two extreme assumptions : ( i ) relativistic lateral expansion in the comoving frame @xcite for which @xmath26 so that at @xmath27 we have @xmath28 , and ( ii ) little or no lateral expansion , @xmath29 for @xmath30 , in which case appreciable lateral expansion occurs only when the jet becomes sub - relativistic and gradually approaches spherical symmetry .    for relativistic lateral expansion , @xmath31 at @xmath32 , where @xmath33^{1/(3-k)}$ ] and the jet radius will be similar to that of the sedov - taylor solution , @xmath34 .",
    "in this case , one expects the flow to approach spherical symmetry only after a few dynamical times .",
    "this is probably not the case as clearly illustrated by the results of numerical simulations @xcite showing only modest lateral expansion as long as the jet is relativistic .",
    "if lateral expansion is neglected , the jet becomes sub - relativistic only at @xmath35^{1/(3-k)}. \\label{nr}\\ ] ] for expansion in a constant density medium ( @xmath13 ) , eq .",
    "( [ nr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath36 while for a wind medium ( @xmath18 ) , it becomes @xmath37    from eq .",

    "( [ nr ] ) simply states that the jet keeps its original opening angle , @xmath29 until @xmath43 , and hence at this time the jet is still far from being spherical .",
    "thus , once the jet becomes sub - relativistic , we expect it to expand sideways significantly , and become roughly spherical only when it has increased its radius by a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "this should occur roughly at a time @xmath45 when @xmath46 : @xmath47 this is a factor of @xmath48 larger than the expected transition time for relativistic lateral expansion in the comoving frame . in the sections that follows we present quantitative estimates of @xmath45 for grb jets expanding in variety of circumburst environments .",
    "common to all calculations is the initiation of the grb explosion as two identical blobs expanding in opposite directions into the circumburst medium .",
    "calculations were done in two dimensions in cylindrical geometry using the ppm adaptive mesh refinement code flash ( ver 2.4 ) .",
    "both blobs and the circumburst medium are modeled by a cold , @xmath49 , ideal gas .",
    "the initial configuration is as follows .",
    "the computational domain , as illustrated in fig . [ fig1 ] , is a unprolonged cylinder in which the ejecta move along the symmetry axis . in the inner region of each of the pancakes , the ejecta mass , @xmath50 is distributed uniformly . in all runs @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    without a detailed understanding of the exact shape and energy distribution of the ejecta",
    ", we have only an approximate description of how to construct the initial conditions .",
    "however , as clearly illustrated by @xcite , the late time evolution of the ejecta is rather insensitive to uncertainties in the initial conditions .",
    "we have considered various initial densities , angular widths , and shapes of the collimated ejecta and found that these are indeed unimportant in determining the late morphology of the remnant .",
    "this stems from the fact that at late times the mass of the remnant is dominated by the circumburst gas , which washes out any variations in the initial conditions of the ejecta .",
    "in this section we present a quantitative discussion of how the grb remnant morphology is modified by expansion into a uniform medium .",
    "expansion into a constant density medium is expected in a variety of progenitor models , in particular those related to short grbs @xcite .",
    "the discussion largely follows that of @xcite , although analytical solutions are derived here to illustrate what may not be obvious from earlier derivations .    in the absence of characteristic scales in stellar ejecta and in the ambient medium ,",
    "self - similar , spherically symmetric solutions exist , and they are widely used to interpret observational data of grb remnants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , as argued in  [ ud ] , near the non - relativistic transition the remnant is far from being spherical and thus the sedov - taylor solution fails to provide an accurate description of the evolution of the grb ejecta .",
    "a simple estimate for @xmath45 can be , however , obtain by assuming that the expansion of each of the collimated blobs is accurately described by a self - similar , spherically symmetric solution . under these conditions",
    ", the problem reduces to depositing a finite amount of energy @xmath9 at two different locations separated by a distance @xmath56 .",
    "this is valid as long as the external medium is uniform around the explosion site .",
    "the evolution of the shock radius for each of the blobs will then follow : @xmath57 with @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the ratio between the remnant width and height , @xmath60 will approach unity as the two blobs expand and merge . the grb remnant will then become nearly spherical in shape after a time @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , the above calculation is only sketchy and should be taken as an order of magnitude figure , as it not only assumes that the mass of the collimated ejecta is negligible with respect to the swept - up gas but also neglects the presence of shocked material throughout the interaction region .",

    "[ fig2 ] , where the density contours of the expanding collimated ejecta at various times in its hydrodynamical evolution are plotted . as the collimated ejecta collides with the ambient medium , a bow shock forms .",
    "the shock propagates in the direction of motion but also perpendicular to it and , over time , wraps around the expanding ejecta .",
    "although initially the remnant may be highly nonspherical , the ratio between its width and height will approach unity as the two blobs expand , merge into a single structure and then finally become spherical in shape .",
    "the resultant structure will not be perfectly spherical as some density inhomogeneities around the equator resulting from the encounter remain visible .",
    "it will be , however , difficult to distinguish it ( based on morphology alone ) from a supernova remnant after about @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "the governing parameters of the late evolution of the remnant are the initial energy of the jet , @xmath9 , and the density of the ambient medium , @xmath67 @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",

    "a bow shock forms as each blob collides with the stellar wind , which eventually wraps around the ejecta before the two expanding shells collide to form a single structure .",

    "moreover , in a wind medium , resistance to sideways expansion is increased .",

    "much of our effort in  [ bubble ] will therefore be dedicated to determining the contribution of the presupernova ejecta of wolf - rayet stars to the circumburst environment , and describing how this external matter can affect the observable characteristics of grb remnants .",

    "@xcite , however , argued that the stellar flux and the radius might still vary only weakly from pole to the equator in very luminous stars .",
    "we therefore applied equations similar to those found by @xcite for winds of rotating stars in the limit of large distance from the star : @xmath90 where we set the parameters defined in @xcite to @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 being mass and radius of the star , and @xmath95 standing for the ratio @xmath96 of stellar to eddington luminosity . under the above conditions",

    "this is mainly because at early stages the morphology of a beamed grb remnant would be very different from that of a spherical explosion . in principle , this can be used to identify those remnants although the dynamical complexity of their sourrounding circumburst medium seriously limits ourr ability to decipher their presence , in particular around massive star progenitors .",

    "observations in various wavelength bands probe very different components of the remnant : synchrotron radio emission gives us information about relativistic electrons , thermal x - ray emission is produced by the bulk of the shocked hot gas , much cooler gas in radiative shocks emits at optical wavelengths , and observations in infrared reveal still cooler gas and dust .",

    "inferring the the presence of a beamed component in these hypernova scenarios would be challenging",
    ". the number density of asymmetric grb remnants in the local universe could be far larger if they expand in a tenuous interstellar medium as expected , for example , in the merger of two neutron stars ( although there are reasons to suspect that the ejecta may not be too narrowly beamed ) and may be easier to constrain directly ( acknowledging the obvious trade - offs in sensitivity and angular resolution , particularly for radio and x - ray observations ) .",
