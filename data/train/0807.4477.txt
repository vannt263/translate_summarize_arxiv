    "having been the major testing grounds of our knowledge on the nature of matter under extreme conditions , neutron stars are among the most mysterious objects in the universe . to understand their structures and properties",
    "has long been a very challenging task for both the astrophysics and the nuclear physics community  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , neutron stars are expected to have a solid inner crust surrounding a liquid core .",
    "knowledge on properties of the crust plays an important role in understanding many astrophysical observations  bps71,bbp71,pet95a , pet95b , lat00,lat07,ste05,lin99,hor04,bur06,owe05 .",
    "the inner crust spans the region from the neutron drip - out point to the inner edge separating the solid crust from the homogeneous liquid core . while the neutron drip - out density @xmath6 is relatively well determined to be about @xmath7 g/@xmath8 @xcite , the transition density @xmath9 at the inner edge is still largely uncertain mainly because of our very limited knowledge on the equation of state ( eos ) , especially the density dependence of the symmetry energy , of neutron - rich nucleonic matter  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties have hampered our accurate understanding of many important properties of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in constraining the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter using terrestrial laboratory experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the most recent review ) .",
    "in particular , the analysis of isospin - diffusion data @xcite in heavy - ion collisions has constrained tightly the density dependence of the symmetry energy in exactly the same sub - saturation density region around the expected inner edge of neutron star crust . moreover , the obtained constraint on the symmetry energy was found to agree with isoscaling analyses in heavy - ion collisions @xcite , the isotopic dependence of the giant monopole resonance in even - a sn isotopes @xcite , and the neutron - skin thickness of @xmath10pb @xcite . in this paper , using the equation of state for neutron - rich nuclear matter constrained by the recent isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions in the same sub - saturation density range as the neutron star crust , we determine the inner edge of neutron star crusts .",
    "consequently , the limit on the radius of the vela pulsar is significantly different from the previous estimate .",
    "in addition , we find that the widely used parabolic approximation ( pa ) to the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter enhances significantly the transition densities and pressures , especially with stiffer symmetry energy functionals .",
    "the inner edge corresponds to the phase transition from the homogeneous matter at high densities to the inhomogeneous matter at low densities . in principle , the inner edge can be located by comparing in detail relevant properties of the nonuniform solid crust and the uniform liquid core mainly consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons ( @xmath11 matter ) .",
    "however , this is practically very difficult since the inner crust may contain nuclei having very complicated geometries , usually known as the ` nuclear pasta '  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the core - crust transition is thought to be a very weak first - order phase transition and model calculations lead to a very small density discontinuities at the transition  @xcite . in practice , therefore , a good approximation is to search for the density at which the uniform liquid first becomes unstable against small amplitude density fluctuations with clusterization .",
    "this approximation has been shown to produce very small error for the actual core - crust transition density and it would yield the exact transition density for a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "several such methods including the dynamical method  @xcite , the thermodynamical method  @xcite and the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite have been applied extensively in the literature . here , we use both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods .    in the dynamical method , the stability condition of a homogeneous @xmath11 matter against small periodic density perturbations with clusterization can be well approximated by bps71,bbp71,pet95a , pet95b , oya07 @xmath12where @xmath13and @xmath14 is the wavevector of the spatially periodic density perturbations and @xmath15 is the chemical potential of particle @xmath16 . in the above expressions",

    "the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ vdyn ] ) represent , respectively , the contributions from the bulk nuclear matter , the density gradient ( surface ) terms and the coulomb interaction . for the coefficients of density gradient terms we use their empirical values of @xmath20 mev@xmath21@xmath22 consistent with the skyrme - hartree - fock calculations  oya07,xclm08 . at @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] , the @xmath24 has the minimal value of @xmath25  bps71,bbp71,pet95a , pet95b , oya07 .",
    "its vanishing point determines the @xmath9 .",
    "the thermodynamical method requires the system to obey the intrinsic stability condition  @xcite or the following inequalities  @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 these conditions are equivalent to require the convexity of the energy per particle in the single phase  @xcite by ignoring the finite size effects due to surface and coulomb energies as shown in the following . in the above",
    ", the @xmath28 is the total pressure of the @xmath11 system with the contributions @xmath29 and @xmath30 from baryons and electrons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the volume and charge per baryon number .",
    "the @xmath33 is the chemical potential defined as @xmath34 in fact , eq .",
    "( [ ther1 ] ) is simply the well - known mechanical stability condition of the system at a fixed @xmath33 .",
    "it ensures that any local density fluctuation will not diverge . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ ther2 ] ) is the charge or chemical stability condition of the system at a fixed density .",
    "it means that any local charge variation violating the charge neutrality condition will not diverge .",
    "if the @xmath35-equilibrium condition is satisfied , namely @xmath36 , the electron contribution to the pressure @xmath30 is only a function of the chemical potential @xmath33 , and in this case one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ther1 ] ) as @xmath37 by using the relation @xmath38 , one can get  @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 is the baryon density and the @xmath43 is the energy per baryon for the nucleonic matter . within the free fermi gas model , the density of electrons @xmath44 is uniquely determined by the electron chemical potential @xmath45",

    "the second inequality is usually valid .",
    "thus , the following condition from the first one @xmath48 determines the thermodynamical instability region .    based on general thermodynamic relations and @xmath49 , one can show  @xcite @xmath50thus , for @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ vther ] ) is equivalent to requiring a positive bulk term @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ vdyn ] ) . generally speaking",
    ", the @xmath53 is in the subsaturation density region where @xmath54 is almost always positive for all models .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamical stability condition is simply the limit of the dynamical one as @xmath55 by neglecting the coulomb interaction .    to locate the inner edge of neutron star crust",
    ", we use the same mdi ( momentum dependent interaction ) eos that was used in analyzing the isospin diffusion in heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "the mdi interaction is based on a modified finite - range gogny effective interaction @xcite and has been extensively used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the baryon potential energy density part of the mdi eos can be expressed as  das03,che05a , che07 @xmath56 here @xmath57 is @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) for neutrons ( protons ) and @xmath60 is the isospin asymmetry .",
    "the meaning and values of other parameters can be found in refs .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is introduced to vary only the density dependence of the symmetry energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear eos fixed @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath62 at saturation density @xmath63 @xmath1 is fixed at @xmath64 mev for all values of the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the isospin symmetric part of the mdi eos was shown to agree with the experimental constraints obtained from relativistic heavy - ion collisions up to about @xmath65 times the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "firstly , to show how the uniform npe matter becomes stable from unstable with increasing baryon density and how to locate the transition density and see the difference between the dynamical and thermodynamical methods as well as effects of the pa , we show in fig .  [ vrhomdi ] the density dependence of @xmath66 and @xmath67 using the mdi interaction with @xmath68 within both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with the full eos and its pa . here",
    ", we have defined @xmath69 and it should be noted that @xmath67 has the same vanishing point as the @xmath70 and the same dimension as the @xmath66 . for the mdi interaction with @xmath68",
    "the transition densities using the full eos within the dynamical and thermodynamical method are @xmath71 @xmath1 and @xmath72 @xmath1 , respectively . while the corresponding results using the pa are @xmath73 @xmath1 and @xmath74 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus , the transition densities are generally lower with the dynamical method as the density gradient term and the coulomb interaction make the system more stable .",
    "however , the pa significantly lifts the transition density regardless of the approach used .",
    "in fact , the difference between calculations using the full eos and its pa is much larger than that caused by using the two different methods .     and @xmath67 for mdi interaction with @xmath68 using both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with the full eos and its parabolic approximation ( pa ) . ]     as a function of @xmath75 from the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with and without the parabolic approximation in the mdi interaction .",

    "[ rhotl ] is the @xmath9 as a function of the slope parameter of the symmetry energy @xmath77 with the mdi interaction . for comparisons ,",
    "we have included results using both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods with the full eos and its parabolic approximation , i.e. , @xmath78 from the same mdi interaction . with the full mdi eos , it is clearly seen that the @xmath9 decreases almost linearly with increasing @xmath75 for both methods .",
    "this feature is consistent with the rpa results  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that both the dynamical and thermodynamical methods give very similar results with the former giving slightly smaller @xmath9 than the later ( the difference is actually less than @xmath3 @xmath1 ) and this is due to the fact that the former includes the density gradient and coulomb terms which make the system more stable and lower the transition density .",
    "the small difference between the two methods implies that the effects of density gradient terms and coulomb term are unimportant in determining the @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "surprisingly , the pa drastically changes the results , especially for stiffer symmetry energies ( larger @xmath75 values ) . also included in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] are the predictions by kubis using the pa of the mdi eos in the thermodynamical approach  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that in the parabolic approximation , using the eos of @xmath79\\delta ^{2}+o(\\delta^{4})$ ] leads to almost the same results . the large error introduced by",
    "the pa is understandable since the @xmath80-stable @xmath11 matter is usually highly neutron - rich and the contribution from the higher order terms in @xmath81 is appreciable .",
    "this is especially the case for the stiffer symmetry energy which generally leads to a more neutron - rich @xmath82 matter at subsaturation densities .",
    "in addition , simply because of the energy curvatures involved in the stability conditions , the contributions from higher order terms in the eos are multiplied by a larger factor than the quadratic term .",
    "these features agree with the early finding @xcite that the @xmath83 is very sensitive to the fine details of the nuclear eos .",
    "we notice that the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter always contains the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry ( at least for the kinetic part of the eos ) .",
    "our results indicate that one may introduce a huge error by assuming _ a priori _ that the eos is parabolic for a given interaction in calculating the @xmath9 .",
    "we thus apply the experimentally constrained @xmath75 to the @xmath84 correlation obtained using the full eos in constraining the @xmath9 . in the following ,",
    "we will mainly focus on the dynamical method as it is more complete and realistic .",
    "the transport model analysis of the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion collisions allowed us to constrain the parameter @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ mdivb ] ) to be between @xmath68 and @xmath85 in the density range of @xmath86 and @xmath87  @xcite . with the full mdi eos ,",
    "the slope parameter was determined to be @xmath88 mev .",
    "the approximately @xmath89 error in @xmath75 is systematic in nature mainly due to the uncertainty of the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections used in the transport model  @xcite .",
    "the statistical errors in both the data analysis  @xcite and model calculations  @xcite are less than the systematic error .",
    "the error in @xmath75 will lead to roughly similar systematic errors in all quantities we study here . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rhotl ] , the constrained @xmath75 then limits the transition density to @xmath0 @xmath90 @xmath2 @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that both approaches used here for finding the core - crust transition density in the @xmath11 matter in neutron stars have also been widely used in studying the spinodal decomposition density associated with the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent applications in neutron - rich matter .",
    "as expected , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , the two phase transitions are asymptotically but inherently related . applying both the dynamical and thermodynamical approaches to symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) at zero temperature for mdi interaction by ignoring the coulomb and surface terms , we find a transition density of @xmath91 .",
    "it is consistent with the spinodal decomposition density for snm at zero temperature from the relativistic mean field model  @xcite and skyrme density functionals  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies  @xcite indicate that some effects beyond the mean - field approximation may affect the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter in the low - density region .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to study how the effects beyond the mean - field approximation as well as other effects such as the many - body forces may change the core - crust transition density of neutron stars .     as functions of @xmath75 and @xmath92 by using the dynamical method with and without parabolic approximation in the mdi interaction",

    "again , it is seen that the pa leads to huge errors for larger ( smaller ) @xmath75 ( @xmath9 ) values . for the full mdi eos ,",
    "the @xmath93 decreases ( increases ) with the increasing @xmath75 ( @xmath9 ) while it displays a complex relation with @xmath75 or @xmath9 for the pa .",

    "@xcite , the @xmath97 depends sensitively on the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities through the @xmath102 and @xmath53 , but there is no explicit dependence upon the higher - density eos .",
    "so far , the only known limit of @xmath103 was extracted from studying the glitches of the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "this together with the upper bounds on the @xmath102 and @xmath53 ( @xmath104 @xmath1 and @xmath105 mev/@xmath4 ) sets approximately a minimum radius of @xmath106 km for the vela pulsar .",
