    "the joint efforts of physicists in the last four decades has resulted in solid evidence , not only at astrophysical scales , but also cosmological , which leave no doubt that our universe is mainly populated by a still undetected non - interactive type of matter , the so - called dark matter , which nature is still unknown . amongst the numerous theories devised to solve this problem , the picture of a weakly interactive massive particle ( wimp ) arises as the most favourable , since the dark matter abundance inferred today from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) matches the abundance of a relic particle with an annihilation cross - section of the order of the weak scale .",
    "furthermore , new particle physics theories motivated by different reasons , provide natural candidates for this type of matter , making this a highly interdisciplinary field of investigation .",
    "+ in the picture of particle dark matter , wimps that populate the milky way can be gravitationally captured by the sun  @xcite . since wimps are mandatorily stable , they will accumulate inside sun and annihilate to become standard model particles .",
    "this annihilation will produce a distinctive neutrino signal that can be detected in current and projected neutrino detectors , providing an excellent indirect survey to dark matter properties , which has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "+ however , most indirect dark matter searches focus on simple models where wimps are majorana particles and annihilate through an @xmath1-wave , velocity independent thermally averaged cross - section . in these models",
    ", it is usual to fix @xmath2 , in order to respect the dark matter density  @xcite , which is precisely determined from cmb measurements  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the dark matter abundance is defined by the time of wimp freeze out , which happens when the universe s temperature drops below the wimps mass , resulting in the decoupling of dark matter particles from the primordial universe thermal bath .",
    "this will result in a constant number of wimps per co - moving volume which corresponds to the one measured today .",
    "+ despite the fact that the usual approach in literature is to use a constant thermally averaged cross - section , there are a large number of well - motivated models which have a @xmath0-wave contribution , ( i.e. a dependence in the relative velocity between wimps ) to the annihilation cross - section which can be dominant .",
    "models where dark matter is a majorana particle , such as the _ neutralino _ , a natural candidate which arises in the minimal super symmetric standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath1-wave annihilation to fermion anti - fermion pairs is helicity suppressed by a factor of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wimps mass  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to @xmath5 conservation , final states with @xmath5=+1 , are only accessible through @xmath0-wave annihilations ( @xmath1-wave states for two identical majorana fermions are @xmath5=-1 ) . hence , neutralino annihilation to @xmath6 or any combination of the vectorial bosons @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can only occur through @xmath0-wave annihilation  @xcite .",
    "another well known example is the case of parity conserving minimal extensions to the standard model ( sm ) with a fermionic dark matter candidate - a gauge singlet dirac fermion - in which annihilation to scalar states with even parity , such as @xmath9 , does not receive a contribution from the @xmath1-wave annihilations  @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we obtain new limits on the dark matter scattering cross - section from the upper limits on the neutrino fluxes measured by the super - kamiokande and icecube neutrino telescopes , using a general model where @xmath0-wave annihilation is the leading contribution to the total annihilation cross - section , i.e. , where we focus in the second term in the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section expansion , + @xmath10    with @xmath11 , and where we also assumed that the @xmath1-wave contribution to the annihilation , as well as higher order terms with @xmath12 , are negligible .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 in [ eq : anncs ] is assumed constant and obtained taking into account the dark matter density at the time of freeze - out , which is roughly the same as today ( see sec . [",
    "sec : dmabundance ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that , since we are mainly interested in the epochs from the moment of wimp freeze - out , the expansion in [ eq : anncs ] is only accurate if wimps freeze out at non - relativistic velocities , i.e. if @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the temperature of freeze - out .",
    "however , in most cases this happens at @xmath16  @xcite , which means that the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section in [ eq : anncs ] is a reliable approximation for our analysis .",
    "+ in section [ sec : dmabundance ] we obtain the coefficient @xmath13 by solving the boltzmann equation for a relic particle with a velocity dependent annihilation cross - section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmsun ] we present the formalism needed to compute the neutrino flux from dark matter annihilation in this picture , as well as the stellar evolution code used to compute the dark matter capture and annihilation to sm particles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmresults ] we present our results followed by some final remarks .",
    "the dark matter particle co - moving number density @xmath17 is governed the boltzmann equation  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath20 is the wimp s number density when in equilibrium with the thermal plasma",
    ". equation [ eq : boltzmann ] takes into account the universe s expansion rate as well as the annihilation and production of wimps from the thermal plasma ( first and second terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ eq : boltzmann ] ) . to simplify equation [ eq : boltzmann ]",
    "it is usual to use the law of entropy conservation defining the number density @xmath21 in terms of the universe s total entropy @xmath22 , and changing the independent variable from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the photon temperature . using the annihilation cross - section given in [ eq : anncs ] , where @xmath26 , the boltzmann equation eq . [ eq : boltzmann ] can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the planck s mass .",
    "the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the universe contributing to the energy density , @xmath30 , can be approximated by a step - function  @xcite and in the epoch of wimp freeze - out is essentially the same as the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom contributing to the total entropy , @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason , hereafter we will use @xmath32 .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the standard case where wimps fully thermalize with the thermal plasma in the early universe . in this case , in the early universe ( for low @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 tracks the equilibrium number density @xmath35 since wimps are constantly annihilating and being produced .",
    "when the annihilation rate drops below the expansion rate , wimps freeze - out , i.e. they fall out of thermodynamic equilibrium and their abundance is fixed .",
    "again , assuming that wimps usually freeze - out at temperatures below their mass @xmath36 , one can use a non - relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath35 for a wimp with @xmath37 degrees of freedom ,    @xmath38    numerically solving equation [ eq : simpboltz ] with [ eq : lambda ] and [ eq : yeq ] , using the condition that @xmath39 at @xmath40 we obtained the wimp number density today , @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boltzmann ] ) .     solved numerically for different wimp masses . for the sake of simplicity it is only shown the equilibrium abundance for @xmath42 .",
    "the number density corresponding to the wimp relic density ( eq .  [ eq : relicdens ] ) inferred from cmb measurements is also shown ( dotted line ) . ]    finally , we can compute the wimp relic density using @xmath43 from where we obtained the value @xmath44 which best reproduces the relic abundance measured from the cmb , @xmath45  @xcite , for a wimp of @xmath46 gev is @xmath47    it is important to stress that this result is mainly independent from the mass , as we can see in fig . [",
    "fig : boltzmann ] , except for logarithmic corrections .",
    "we can also see by fig .",
    "[ fig : boltzmann ] that wimps freeze - out at a temperature of roughly @xmath48 which is consistent with the hypothesis that freeze - out occurs when wimps are non - relativistic .",
    "dark matter particles in the milky way halo can be gravitationally trapped inside the sun .",
    "this capture process will continue until equilibrium with annihilation is attained , which will fix the number of wimps inside the sun .",
    "the hot plasma will have impact , not only in the dark matter distribution inside the sun , but also on the neutrino flux resulting from its annihilation .",
    "the number of wimps in the sun is governed by three distinct processes : capture , annihilation and evaporation ( which is the inverse reaction of capture ) .",
    "when the evaporation process is negligible , which is our case since we are studying wimps with @xmath49 gev  @xcite , the number of wimps is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the capture rate , and @xmath52 ^ 2}\\ ] ] is the annihilation coefficient , which is integrated over the sun s volume taking into account the wimps distribution , @xmath53 .",
    "equation [ eq : wimpnumber ] has a straightforward solution , which yields    @xmath54    defining the equilibrium time - scale @xmath55 , which represents the time needed to achieve equilibrium between wimp capture and annihilation , the number of wimps in the sun today is in equilibrium if @xmath56 , where @xmath57 gyr . in that case ,",
    "equation [ eq : wimpnumber2 ] simplifies to @xmath58 and the annihilation rate is simply given by @xmath59 as we can see by equation [ eq : annihilationrate ] , if the wimp number equilibrium has been attained , the annihilation rate , @xmath60 , and consequently the neutrino flux , will depend exclusively on the capture rate , which means that no conclusions can be made regarding the nature of the dark matter annihilation cross - section using data from neutrino experiments .",
    "+ in the usual approach , where wimps annihilate through @xmath1-wave , the number of wimps in the sun is in the equilibrium regime for most of the wimp parameter region of interest , and the last equality of eq .",
    "[ eq : annihilationrate ] is an excellent approximation .",
    "however , in our case , where the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section is given by [ eq : anncs ] , the annihilation coefficient is @xmath61 which will generally yield @xmath62 , rendering the approximation in [ eq : annihilationrate ] unreasonable .",
    "for example , simple order of magnitude estimations yield that wimps with @xmath63 gev will mainly populate the inner 6 % of the solar radius  ( see eq",
    ". 2.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . , where the temperature is approximately @xmath64 k , which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the freeze - out temperature for a wimp with the same characteristics .",
    "this means that @xmath65 for wimps annihilating in the sun will be dramatically lower than @xmath66 at freeze - out , which will in turn ( eq .  [ eq : annint ] ) increase the equilibrium time - scale .",
    "this will be further explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsequilibrium ] .      to compute the annihilation coefficient in eq .",
    "[ eq : annint ] one needs to know the properties of dark matter inside the sun , namely its distribution and temperature .",
    "the wimps distribution in the sun is governed by the knudsen number , @xmath67 which is the ratio between the wimps mean free path in the center of the sun , and the length - scale of its distribution  @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the solar central temperature and density respectively . if @xmath71 , wimps are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with the solar plasma and reflect its temperature , i.e. @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath73 , wimps will transport energy non - locally and will have an isothermal distribution characterized by a unique temperature , @xmath74  @xcite . to obtain the wimp distribution for arbitrary @xmath75 , it is usual to interpolate between the lte and isothermal distributions .",
    "the interpolation is computed using a suppression factor , function of @xmath75 , which accounts for the departure of the lte regime .",
    "wimps inside the sun will also contribute as an effective mechanism of energy transport  @xcite , which efficiency will depend on the knudsen number , @xmath75 , and will be different for the two regimes discussed above , lte and non - local .",
    "this process can have impact in the sun s structure  @xcite , however , in our case this impact is negligible , hence we will not pursue this subject further .      in our work we used a stellar evolution code which is based on cesam  @xcite that has been further developed to include not only dark matter capture and annihilation , but also its energy transport and distribution inside the sun  @xcite , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmsunnumber ] and [ sec : dmsundist ] . the reference model without dark matter is calibrated to achieve a standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite in full agreement with the predominant solar models used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a brief remark regarding the theoretical uncertainty in current solar models , which is mainly caused by the uncertainty on the heavy element abundances  @xcite , should be made at this point .",
    "recent independent determinations of the photospheric heavy element abundances  @xcite have led to lower metallicity to hydrogen ratio when compared with older estimations by  @xcite . despite using complex and improved solar atmosphere models , these downward revisions of the photospheric heavy element abundances result in solar models hard to reconcile with helioseismological and solar neutrino data  @xcite , in opposition to the older estimation by  @xcite which is in agreement with observations . the solution to this discrepancy , known as the solar abundance problem , is yet to be found , as well as the consensus on which heavy element mixture best reproduces the actual sun ( see * ? ? ? * and ref . therein ) .",
    "for this reason we decided to use both the heavy element mixture by ( * ? ?",

    "* gs98 ) with a lower metallicity , @xmath77 , in order to study the impact of the solar chemical composition uncertainty in our results .",
    "the sun is evolved from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) in a galactic halo with a constant dark matter energy density until its present age . for each series of wimp parameters ,",
    "the model is calibrated by automatic adjustment of the convection mixing length parameter and helium abundance , until it reaches a precision of @xmath78 of the present luminosity , radius and mass .",
    "the calibration process takes an average of 10 iterated full - runs to obtain the desired precision .",
    "dark matter capture , thermal annihilation ( eq . [ eq : annint ] ) and energy transport are computed at each time step , in order to consistently achieve the values expected today .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained for thermally annihilating dark matter in the sun for different wimp masses , spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) scattering cross - sections .",
    "we used a dark matter density of @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "we assume the standard value for the local orbital speed of the sun @xmath80  @xcite , which results in a velocity dispersion for the standard maxwellian dark matter halo of @xmath81 .      to study how wimps are distributed in the solar medium , we computed the knudsen number ( eq .

    "+ the limits on the scattering cross - section presented in  [ sec : dmresults ] are susceptible to various uncertainties , mainly stemming from the current uncertainty on the capture rate of wimps from the sun , which in turn is sensible to the uncertainty on the local dark matter density @xmath123 and the velocity distribution of wimps in the milky way . regarding the former , independent determinations have shown that the local dark matter can be at least a factor of two larger than the value used here  @xcite .",

    "+ we would like to acknowledge the authors of the numerical packages used in this work , namely morel and lebreton for the stellar evolution code , cesam ; eugnio and casanellas for including all the dark matter framework in the code ; and finally blennow , edsj and ohlsson for wimpsim .",
    "we would also like to thanks the anonymous referee for the insightful comments that helped improve this article .",

    "<S> we used a consistent and robust solar model to obtain upper limits placed by neutrino telescopes , such as icecube and super - kamiokande , on the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross - section , for a general model of dark matter with a velocity dependent ( @xmath0-wave ) thermally averaged cross - section . in this picture , the boltzmann equation for the dark matter abundance is numerically solved satisfying the dark matter density measured from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for lower cross - sections and higher masses , the dark matter annihilation rate drops sharply , resulting in upper bounds on the scattering cross - section one order of magnitude above those derived from a velocity independent ( @xmath1-wave ) annihilation cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that upper limits on the scattering cross - section obtained from dark matter annihilating in the sun are sensible to the uncertainty in current standard solar models , fluctuating a maximum of 20 % depending on the annihilation channel . </S>"
