    "the idea that remote parts of the universe , or even that _ different _ universes , could be connected by smooth bridges or tunnels constitutes a very intriguing concept , which for many decades has captivated the imagination of science fiction lovers @xcite , @xcite . in physics , spacetimes containing such bridges ( called  wormholes \" by j.a .",
    "wheeler ) appear in general relativity as solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "nearly half a century ago , the concept of wormholes lead wheeler to the discussion of topological entities called geons @xcite and to the conception of geometrodynamics @xcite , where  matter comes from no matter \" , and ",
    "charge comes from no charge \" .    lately , after the fundamental papers by morris , thorne and yurtsewer @xcite and morris and thorne @xcite , the notion of traversable lorentzian wormholes has gained much attention within the physics community .",
    "these authors showed that such wormholes could , in principle , allow humans not only to travel between universes , or distant parts of a single universe , but also to construct time machines . it has been suggested that black holes and wormholes are interconvertible . in particular that stationary wormholes could be possible final states of black - hole evaporation @xcite . also , that astrophysical accretion of ordinary matter could convert wormholes into black holes @xcite ( this issue has recently been discussed in literature and different approaches give , in general , different results - see @xcite , @xcite ) .    today , it is well known that a wormhole geometry can only appear as a solution of the einstein field equations if the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) of the matter supporting such a geometry violates the null energy condition ( nec ) at least in the neighborhood of the wormhole throat @xcite-@xcite ( matter that violates the nec is usually called _ exotic _ ) .",
    "although in general relativity there are many examples of matter that are consistent with wormhole spacetimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) , none of them are observable in the real world of astrophysics :  all these spacetimes still remain in the domain of fiction \" @xcite .",
    "this is a very important and challenging issue in wormhole physics , which is known as the",
    " exotic matter problem \" .",
    "there are numerous attempts at solving this issue in the literature .",
    "some consider alternative theories of gravity @xcite-@xcite or invoke quantum effects in curved spacetimes , considering wormholes as semiclasical objects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , a general no - go theorem was proved by bronnikov and starobinsky showing the absence of wormholes in scalar - tensor gravity without ghosts @xcite .",
    "a different approach to this issue arises in the context of higher - dimensional theories . in kaluza - klein gravity",
    "the exotic matter necessary for the formation of a wormhole can appear from the off - diagonal elements of the metric ( the gauge fields ) and from the @xmath5 component of the metric ( the scalar field ) , rather than coming from some externally given exotic matter @xcite . also the so - called einstein - gauss - bonnet theory admits wormhole solutions that would not violate the nec provided the gauss - bonnet coupling constant is negative @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been proposed that braneworld gravity provides a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is because the local high - energy effects and non - local corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk could lead to an effective violation of the nec on the brane even when the standard - model fields satisfy the energy conditions . in this paper",
    "we adhere to the latter framework and develop a number of spherically symmetric , static lorentzian wormholes which are analytic solutions to the equations on the brane .    in the randall @xmath3 sundrum braneworld scenario @xcite",
    "the effective equations for gravity in @xmath6 were derived by shiromizu , maeda and sasaki @xcite . in vacuum ,",
    "when matter on the brane is absent and the @xmath7-dimensional cosmological constant vanishes , these equations reduce to . ]",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual einstein tensor in @xmath6 ; @xmath10 is taken to be @xmath11 or @xmath12 depending on whether the extra dimension is spacelike or timelike , respectively ; @xmath13 is the projection onto the brane of the weyl tensor in @xmath14 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the @xmath14 unit vector @xmath17 orthogonal to the brane . this quantity connects the physics in @xmath6 with the geometry of the bulk .",
    "the vacuum field equations on the brane ( [ sms equations ] ) are formally equivalent to the einstein equations of general relativity with an effective emt given by @xmath18 .",
    "the crucial point here is that due to its geometrical nature , @xmath13 does not have to satisfy the energy conditions applicable to ordinary matter .",
    "in fact , there are a number of examples in the literature where the effective emt corresponds to exotic matter on the brane @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath19 is the most natural  matter \" supporting wormholes @xcite .",
    "however , the set of equations ( [ sms equations ] ) does not form a closed system in @xmath6 , because @xmath13 is unknown without specifying , _ both _ the metric in @xmath14 , and the way the @xmath6 spacetime is identified , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "the only truly general thing we know is that @xmath19 is traceless .",
    "therefore , the only quantity that can be unambiguously specified on the brane is the trace of the curvature scalar @xmath20 . in particular , in empty space @xmath21 in this paper we investigate spherically symmetric solutions to this equation of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the line element on a unit sphere . in these",
    "coordinates the field equation ( [ field eqs . for empty space ] ) can be written as ( a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath24 ) @xmath25 in curvature coordinates , i.e. , in coordinates where @xmath26 , this is a second - order differential equation for @xmath27 and a first - order one for @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , it has a nondenumerable infinity of solutions parameterized by some arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath24 @xcite .    in curvature coordinates the simplest ( non - trivial ) solutions to ( [ field equation for the general spherical metric ] ) are obtained by setting either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the former case yields the spatial - schwarzschild wormhole @xcite , while the latter one gives @xmath31 , which is a black hole with total mass @xmath32 and a horizon at @xmath33 .",
    "the next simple solution is the schwarzschild metric @xmath34 if one chooses either @xmath27 or @xmath28 as in the schwarzschild metric , then the asymptotic flatness of the solutions is guaranteed , and the vacuum braneworld solutions contain the schwarzschild spacetime as a particular case .",
    "this choice generates the  temporal schwarzschild \" metric @xcite , @xcite , @xmath35}dr^2 - r^2 d\\omega^2,\\ ] ] and the  spatial schwarzschild \" metric @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless constant parameters . for @xmath39 , @xmath40",
    "the corresponding solutions reduce to the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the above metrics have thoroughly been discussed in different contexts : as braneworld black holes @xcite , @xcite ; as possible non - schwarzshild exteriors for spherical stars on the brane @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and as wormhole spacetimes @xcite .    in this work",
    "we construct several families of new solutions to @xmath1 of the form ( [ the metric under study ] ) , with @xmath41 .",
    "the new solutions are specifically designed so that they contain the schwarzschild black hole and generalize the temporal and spatial schwarzschild solutions mentioned above .",
    "they generate new families of traversable lorenzian wormholes as well as nakedly singular spacetimes .",
    "the solutions are obtained by demanding that the spacetime must contain , instead of the schwarzschild geometry as in ( [ t - schw exterior])-([s - schw exterior ] ) , a simple static solution to @xmath1 that follows from @xmath0-dimensional kaluza - klein gravity ( see eq .",
    "( [ kramer - like solution ] ) bellow ) .",
    "some interesting features of our models are that , for certain values of the parameters of the solutions , ( i ) the size of the throat can be less than the schwarzschild radius @xmath4 , which no longer defines the horizon , i.e. , to a distant observer a particle or light falling down crosses the schwarzschild radius in a finite time ; ( ii ) they contain three spherical surfaces ( instead of one as in lorentzian wormholes _ a la _ morris and thorne ) which are extremal and have finite area .",
    "two of them have the same size and meet the  flare - out \" requirements , and show the typical violation of the energy conditions that characterizes a wormhole throat .",
    "the other extremal sphere is  flaring - in \" in the sense that its sectional area is a local maximum and the weak , null and dominant energy conditions are satisfied in its neighborhood . after bouncing back at this second surface",
    "a traveler crosses into another space which is the double of the one she / he started in .",

    "let us briefly examine some of the properties of this metric .",
    "when @xmath54 , from ( [ condition on a and b ] ) it follows that @xmath55 in which case ( [ kramer - like solution ] ) becomes @xmath56 for @xmath57 this is the spatial - schwarzschild wormhole @xcite , for @xmath58 it is a naked singularity and for @xmath59 it is minkowski spacetime .",

    "the models with @xmath115 ( case @xmath167 ) represent traversable wormholes that can have throats located at @xmath196 .",
    "what this means is that , as seen from outside , a particle or light falling down reaches the schwarzschild radius ( which no longer defines the horizon ) in a finite time .",
    "it should be noted that in general relativity , in order to have a throat larger ( less ) than the schwarzschild radius for a given mass at a flat asymptotic , it is necessary to have matter with negative ( positive ) energy density @xcite .",
