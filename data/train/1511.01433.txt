    "quantum - state tomography ( qst ) is the standard protocol used to estimate and characterize the state of a quantum system .",
    "qst is expensive to implement experimentally , however , since the resources to reconstruct an arbitrary state scale poorly with the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , one can improve the efficiency of qst through the use of prior information . in state - of - the - art experiments in quantum information science",
    "the goal is not to produce arbitrary states but pure states .",
    "if one has calibrated the device and seen it to be performing well , e.g. , based on randomized benchmarking  @xcite , then with good confidence we can expect that the device is processing states that are close to pure . as a first approximation",
    ", we can assume the state is exactly pure , though of course , this is never true in any real device .",
    "including this prior information in qst results in more manageable tomography protocol where resources scale only linearly with the dimension as has been studied in a variety of previous works  @xcite .    when considering pure - state tomography , and bounded - rank state ( a state with rank @xmath0 )",
    "tomography more generally , a natural notion of informational completeness emerges  @xcite , referred to as _",
    "rank-@xmath1 completeness_. a measurement is rank-@xmath1 complete if the measurement probabilities uniquely distinguish a state with rank @xmath0 from any other state with rank @xmath0 .",
    "a rigorous definition is given below .",
    "recently , there was an effort to formulate such measurements  @xcite .",
    "for example , heinosaari  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed for states in finite @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space , the expectation values of particular @xmath3 observables corresponds to rank-@xmath1 complete measurement .",
    "the set of quantum states with rank @xmath0 is , however , nonconvex and therefore , in the presence of experimental noise , convergence to a reliable estimate is not guaranteed when using rank-@xmath1 complete measurements .",
    "this poses a concern for the practicality of such measurements for qst .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is two fold : ( i ) we develop the significance of a different notion of informational completeness , _",
    "rank-@xmath1 strict - completeness_. we prove that strictly - complete measurements allow for robust estimation of bounded - rank states in the realistic case of noise and experimental imperfections , by solving essentially any convex program . because of this , strictly - complete measurements are crucial for the implementation of pure - state qst .",
    "( ii ) we argue , based on numerical evidence , that it is fairly straightforward to implement such measurements based solely on projective measurements in few random orthonormal bases , with a very weak dependence on the dimension of hilbert space .    the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : info complete ] , we define the notions of rank-@xmath1 complete and rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms . in sec .  [",
    "sec : power of strict ] , we establish the importance of strictly - complete povms for practical qst . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we provide numerical evidence that a measurement of a few orthonormal bases implements a strictly - complete povm and demonstrate the robustness of such measurements . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we offer some conclusions .",
    "completeness . * the measurement record , distinguishes the rank @xmath0 state from any other rank @xmath0 psd matrix",
    ". however , there generally will be infinitely many other states , with rank greater than @xmath1 , that are consistent with the measurement record . *",
    "( b ) rank-@xmath1 strict - completeness . *",
    "the measurement record distinguishes the rank @xmath0 state from any other psd matrix .",
    "thus it is unique in the convex set of positive matrices . once normalized , these are possible quantum states .",
    "thus , the only one physical quantum state is consistent with the measurement record . ]",
    "qst has two basic ingredients , states and measurements , so it is important to define these precisely .",
    "a quantum state is a density matrix , @xmath4 , that is positive semidefinite ( psd ) and normalized to unit trace .",
    "a quantum measurement with @xmath5 possible outcomes ( events ) is defined by a povm with @xmath5 elements , @xmath6 .",
    "a povm is informationally complete if the measurement probabilities , @xmath7 , distinguish the state @xmath4 from any other state . while we typically think of povms as as a map between quantum states and probabilities , mathematically",
    ", a povm is a map on any hermitian matrix , and in particular on psd matrices .",
    "in fact , it is advantageous to define the different notions of informational completeness , rank-@xmath1 complete and rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete , in terms of psd matrices , and then apply them to quantum states , i.e. , psd matrices with unit trace .",
    "this highlights the fact that the definitions and our results are independent of the trace constraint of quantum states , and only depend on their positivity property . additionally , because , by definition , the povm elements sum to the identity , the trace of the matrix is always `` measured . ''",
    "therefore , we first present the mathematical formalism in terms of psd matrices , and then apply it to quantum states .",
    "we will comment about the role of the trace constraint where necessary .    consider a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9=({{\\rm tr}}(\\cdot e_1),\\ldots,{{\\rm tr}}(\\cdot e_m))$ ] be the map defined by the povm from hermitian matrices to a real vector space , @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 acts on a quantum state @xmath4 , it returns a vector of probabilities , @xmath12=({{\\rm tr}}(\\rho e_1),\\ldots,{{\\rm tr}}(\\rho e_m))\\equiv{\\bm p}$ ] .",
    "more generally , when @xmath11 acts on a psd matrix @xmath13 , it returns a `` measurement '' vector @xmath14 , whose components @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "it is also useful to define the kernel of a povm , @xmath17={\\bf 0}\\}$ ] . since the povm elements sum to the identity matrix",
    ", we immediately obtain that every @xmath18 is traceless , @xmath19 .    in bounded - rank qst ,",
    "rank-@xmath1 completeness is a natural concept  @xcite , which we define here in terms of psd matrices .",
    "+ * definition  1 : * let @xmath20 be the set of @xmath21 psd matrices with rank @xmath0 .",
    "a povm is said to be _",
    "rank-@xmath1 complete _ if @xmath22\\neq{\\cal m}_{\\cal e}[x_2],\\ ] ] except for possibly a set of rank-@xmath1 states that are dense on a set of measure zero , called the `` failure set . ''",
    "+ in the context of qst , the probabilities of a rank-@xmath1 complete povm uniquely identify the rank @xmath0 state from within the set of all psd matrices with rank @xmath0 , @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustration]a illustrates the notion of rank-@xmath1 completeness . given a rank",
    "@xmath0 state in the failure set , the probabilities of the measurement outcomes do not uniquely identify the state from within the set of all rank @xmath0 states ; this was considered in  @xcite . for random states or a random measurement bases , however , the chance of hitting the failure state is vanishingly small .",
    "we comment on the implications of the failure set for practical tomography in the sections to follow .    using @xmath24 we arrive at an alternative , equivalent , definition for rank-@xmath1 complete : a povm @xmath25 is rank-@xmath1 complete if @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , the difference @xmath28 is not in the kernel of @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "carmeli  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for a povm to be rank-@xmath1 complete is that every nonzero @xmath31 has @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the number of strictly positive and strictly negative eigenvalues of a matrix , respectively .",
    "this condition was derived for psd matrices with rank @xmath0 .",
    "if we exclude the positivity property , and only consider the rank property , we obtain a sufficient condition : a povm is rank-@xmath1 complete if every nonzero @xmath31 has @xmath35 .",
    "this sufficient condition applies to all hermitian matrices with rank @xmath0 . using the sufficient condition alone ,",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the expectation values of particular @xmath3 observables corresponds to rank-@xmath1 complete measurement , and moreover  @xcite that a measurement of @xmath36 random orthonormal bases is rank-@xmath1 complete .",
    "definition  1 does not say anything about higher - rank matrices .",
    "in particular for qst , if the povm is rank-@xmath1 complete , and the state of the system has rank @xmath0 , then according to the definition , there could be higher - rank quantum states that yeild the same probabilities .",
    "therefore , when applying a rank-@xmath1 complete measurement , in the presence of noise and other experimental imperfections , it may be difficult to differentiate between the unique rank @xmath0 states and these higher - rank states since the set @xmath23 is nonconvex . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we can consider a ",
    "stricter \" definition of rank-@xmath1 completeness  @xcite : + * definition  2 : * let @xmath37 be the set of @xmath21 psd matrices .",
    "a povm is said to be _",
    "rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete _ if @xmath38\\neq{\\cal m}_{\\cal e}[x_2],\\ ] ] except for possibly a set of rank-@xmath1 states that are dense on a set of measure zero , called the `` failure set . ''",
    "+ the implication for qst is that when the state being measured is promised to be in @xmath23 , the measurement probabilities of a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm distinguish this state from any other psd matrix , of _ any _ rank ( except on the failure set ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustration](b ) illustrates the notion of rank-@xmath1 strict - completeness .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a povm is rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete if , and only if , every nonzero @xmath18 has @xmath39 .",
    "again , this condition relies on the psd property of the matrices . to date , there are only a few known povms that are rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete .",
    "one example , we recently showed that a specific set of @xmath40 orthonormal bases is rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete measurement in the context of matrix completion  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the notion of rank-@xmath1 completeness , which can be defined generally for bounded - rank hermitian matrices , the definition of strict - completeness applies nontrivially only to psd matrices , and therefore , in particular to quantum states  @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us apply the definition of strict - completeness for bounded - rank hermitian matrices , ignoring positivity .",
    "let @xmath41 be a hermitian matrix with @xmath42 and let @xmath43 be a hermitian matrix with @xmath44 .",
    "then the rank of their difference , @xmath45 , is at most @xmath2 , @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , following the definition , in order to be a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete for hermitian matrices , the kernel of the measurement must not include hermitian matrices whose rank @xmath47 .",
    "since the latter is the set of all @xmath48 hermitian matrices , we conclude that the kernel of such measurement includes only the ( trivial ) zero matrix .",
    "this , in turn , means that to be a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete measurement for all hermitian matrices the measurement must be fully informationally complete , i.e. , able to uniquely identify any hermitian matrix , of any rank .",
    "[ sec : power of strict ] the power of strictly - complete measurements become evident when we consider implementations in a realistic experimental context . it is essential that the estimation protocol be robust to noise and other imperfections .",
    "thus , any realistic estimation procedure should allow one to find the closest estimate ( by some appropriate measure of distance ) given a bound on the noise .",
    "we can address this by convex optimization , whereby the estimate is found by minimizing a convex function over a convex set . since rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povms uniquely identify a rank-@xmath1 quantum state within the _ convex _ set of psd matrices , the data obtained from measurements defined by these povms fits the convex optimization paradigm . on the other hand ,",
    "rank-@xmath1 complete measurements uniquely identify the rank-@xmath1 state only within the _ non - convex _ set of rank-@xmath1 psd matrices , and therefore are not compatible to use with convex optimization .    in the following corollaries",
    "the variable @xmath13 is a psd matrix , not necessarily with a unit trace .",
    "we first consider the case that the measurement is noiseless with the following corollary : + * corollary  1 ( uniqueness ) : * let @xmath49 be a quantum state with rank @xmath0 , and let @xmath50 $ ] be the corresponding probabilities of a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm @xmath51 .",
    "then , the solution to @xmath52=\\bm{p}\\ , \\ ,   { \\rm and } \\ , \\ ,   x \\geq 0,\\ ] ] or to @xmath53-\\bm{p}\\vert\\;\\ ;",
    "{ \\rm s.t.}\\ ; x \\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a any convex function of @xmath13 , and @xmath55 is any norm function , is unique : @xmath56 .",
    "+ _ proof : _ this is a direct corollary of the definition of strict - completeness . since , by definition , the probabilities of rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm uniquely determine @xmath49 from within the set of all psd matrices , its reconstruction becomes a feasibility problem over the convex set @xmath57=\\bm{p},x\\geq0\\}$ ] , @xmath58=\\bm{p}\\ , \\ ,   { \\rm and } \\ , \\ , x \\geq 0.\\ ] ] the solution for this feasibility problem is @xmath49 uniquely .",
    "therefore , any convex program , which looks for the solution within the feasible set , is guaranteed to find @xmath49.@xmath59    corollary  1 was proved in  @xcite for the particular choice @xmath60 , and also in the context of compressed sensing measurements in  @xcite .",
    "note , while one can also include a trace constraint @xmath61 , in this noiseless case , eqs .   and",
    ", this is redundant since any povm measures the trace of a matrix .",
    "thus , if we have prior information that @xmath62 , then the feasible set in eq .",
    "is equal to the set @xmath63=\\bm{p } , \\ , x \\geq 0,\\ ,   { \\rm and } \\ , { { \\rm tr}}(x ) = t \\}$ ] . in particular , in the context of qst with noiseless data , the constraint @xmath64 would be redundant ; the reconstructed state would necessarily be properly normalized .",
    "the corollary implies that strictly - complete povms allow for the reconstruction of bounded - rank states via convex optimization , even though the set of bounded - rank states is nonconvex .",
    "moreover , all convex programs over the feasible solution set , i.e. , of the form of eqs .   and  , are equivalent for this task . for example , this result applies to maximum-(log)likelihood estimation  @xcite where @xmath65 .",
    "the corollary does not apply for states in the povm s failure set , if such set exists .    in any real experiment ,",
    "the assumption that the state has rank @xmath0 is only an approximation , and moreover the measurement record always contains experimental noise . in this case , we wish to find an estimate of the state , e.g. , the closest state consistent the measurement record .",
    "determining such a state for rank-@xmath1 complete measurements is generally a hard problem since the set of bounded - rank states in nonconvex .",
    "however , strict - completeness , together with the convergence properties of convex programs , ensure a robust state estimation in realistic experimental scenarios .",
    "this is the main advantage of strictly - complete measurements and it is formalized in the following corollary . + * corollary  2 ( robustness ) : * let @xmath66 be the state of the system , and let @xmath67+{\\bm e}$ ] be the ( noisy ) measurement record of a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm @xmath51 , such that @xmath68 . if @xmath69\\vert\\leq \\epsilon$ ] for some quantum state @xmath49 with @xmath70 , then the solution to @xmath71-\\bm{f}\\vert\\leq\\epsilon\\ , \\ ,   { \\rm and } \\ , \\ ,   x \\geq 0,\\ ] ] or to @xmath72-\\bm{f}\\vert\\;\\ ; { \\rm s.t.}\\ ; x \\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a any convex function of @xmath13 , is robust : @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , where @xmath55 is any @xmath75-norm , and @xmath76 is a constant which depends only on the povm .",
    "+   + the proof , given in the appendix , is derived from lemma  v.5 of  @xcite where it was proved for the particular choice @xmath60 . in  @xcite this",
    "was also studied in the context of compressed sensing measurements .",
    "this corollary assures that if the state of the system is close to a bounded - rank density matrix , and it was measured with strictly - complete measurements , then it can be robustly estimated with any convex program , constrained to the set of psd matrices .",
    "in particular , it implies that all convex estimators preform qualitatively the same for low - rank state estimation . this may be advantageous especially when considering estimation of high - dimensional quantum state . as in the noiseless case , the trace constraint is not necessary for corollary  2 , and in fact leaving it allows us to make different choices for @xmath54 , as was done in ref .",
    "therefore , in general , the estimated matrix @xmath77 is not normalized , @xmath78 .",
    "the final estimation of the state is then given by @xmath79 . in principle",
    ", we can consider a different version of eqs .   and   where we include the trace constraint , and",
    "this may have implications for the issue of  bias \" in the estimator .",
    "this will be studied in more details elsewhere .",
    "we study here a straightforward experimentally feasible protocol to implement strictly - complete measurements . in particular , in our numerical analysis shown below , we find that simply by measuring only few random orthonormal bases amounts to strict - completeness .",
    "note , measurement of random bases were also considered in the context of compressed sensing ( see , e.g. , in  @xcite ) . however , when taking into account the psd property of density matrices , we obtain strict - completeness with fewer measurements than required for compressed sensing  @xcite .",
    "therefore , strict - completeness does not imply compressed sensing . while for quantum states , all compressed sensing measurements are strictly - complete  @xcite , not all strictly - complete measurements are compressed sensing measurements .    as a first numerical test we study the number of random bases that corresponds to a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete measurement for @xmath80 . to determine this , we take the ideal case where the probabilities are known exactly and the rank of the state is fixed .",
    "we consider two types of measurements on a variety of different dimensions : ( i ) a set of haar - random orthonormal bases on unary systems with dimensions @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ; and ( ii ) a set of local haar - random orthonormal bases on a tensor product of @xmath83 qubits with @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , corresponding to @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "for each dimension , and for each rank , we generate @xmath88 haar - random states . each state",
    "is then measured with an increasing number of bases .",
    "the noiseless measurement record , @xmath89 , are the probabilities of the measurement outcomes .",
    "after each new basis measurement we use the constrained least - square ( ls ) program , eq .   where @xmath55 is the @xmath90-norm , to produce an estimate of the state .",
    "we emphasize that the constrained ls finds the quantum state that is the most consistent with @xmath89 with no restrictions on rank .",
    "the procedure is repeated until all estimates match the states used to generate the data ( up to numerical error of @xmath91 in infidelity ) .",
    "this indicates the random bases used correspond to a rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete povm .",
    ".*number of random orthonormal bases corresponding to strict - completeness .",
    "* each cell lists the minimal number of measured bases for which the infidelity was below @xmath91 for each of the tested states in the given dimensions and ranks .",
    "this indicates that a measurement of only few random bases is strictly - complete povm . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we present our findings in table  [ tbl : noiseless ] . for each dimension",
    ", we also tested fewer bases than listed in the table .",
    "these bases corresponded to strictly - complete measurements for most states but not all .",
    "for example , for the unary system with @xmath92 , using the measurement record from @xmath93 bases we can reconstruct all states with an infidelity below the threshold except for one .",
    "the results indicate that measuring only few random bases , with weak dependence on the dimension , corresponds to a strictly - complete povm for low - rank quantum states .",
    "moreover , the difference between , say rank-1 and rank-2 , amounts to measuring only few more bases .",
    "this is important , as discussed below , in realistic scenarios when the state of the system is known to be close to pure .",
    "finally , when considering local measurements , more bases are required to account for strict - completeness when compared to unary system , see for example results for @xmath94 .",
    "next , we simulate a realistic scenario , where the state of the system has high purity and the experimental data contains statistical noise . from corollary",
    "2 we expect to obtain a robust estimation of the state , by solving any convex estimator of the form of eqs .   and  , when measuring a set of random orthonormal bases that correspond to rank-@xmath95 strictly - complete povm .",
    "as before we numerically study unary systems , ( @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ) and systems composed of ( 3,4 , and 5 ) qubits , with the same bases introduced for the noiseless case .",
    "we generate 200 haar - random pure - states ( target states ) , @xmath98 , and take the state of the system to be @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is a random full - rank state .",
    "the measurement record , @xmath102 , is simulated by sampling @xmath103 trials from the probability distribution corresponding to the measured basis .",
    "for each number of measured bases , we estimate the state  @xcite based on different convex optimization programs : ( i ) a constrained trace - minimization program , eq .   with @xmath104 , ( ii ) a constrained ls program , eq .   using the @xmath90-norm , and ( iii ) the maximum-(log)likelihood program based on the algorithm described in  @xcite .    in fig .",

    ", the various convex programs we used robustly estimate the state with number of bases correspond to rank-1 strictly - complete povm .",
    "furthermore , in accordance to our findings of table  [ tbl : noiseless ] , measuring only a few more bases , such that the overall povm is rank-@xmath108 strictly - complete , and so forth , we improve the estimation accordingly . a practical protocol for doing qst could be to iteratively measure a basis and reconstruct the state via convex optimization until the fidelity converges .    .",
    "following corollary  2 , we obtain a robust estimation regardless of the particular program used to estimate the state . ]",
    "we have studied qst under the assumption that the state of the system is known to be close to a pure state , or more generally , to a rank @xmath0 state . since the set of rank @xmath0 states is nonconvex , it is generally difficult to robustly estimate the state of the system by measuring rank-@xmath1 complete povms .",
    "we showed , however , that a robust estimation is guaranteed if the measurements are rank-@xmath1 strictly - complete .",
    "such measurements efficiently identify a low - rank state from within the set of all quantum states .",
    "the essential ingredient to strict - completeness is the positivity constraint associated with physical density matrices .",
    "moreover , the estimation can be done by solving any convex program over the feasible set and the estimate returned is robust to errors .",
    "in addition , guided by numerical tests , we conjecture that it is rather straightforward to design strictly - complete measurements . depending on the dimension and rank of the state , measuring only few random orthogonal bases results in strict - completeness , for unary system as well as system of qubits . therefore , strictly - complete measurements are essential for practical implementations of qst .",
