    "interest in coordinate - free representations formulas for linear anisotropic elastic materials has been an active research area , starting by the formulation of elastic energy functionals in the framework of finite strains  @xcite and having a key role in the classification of linear elastic or piezoelectric materials  @xcite .",
    "it has also been of main importance in the continuum mechanics representation of cracked / damaged media @xcite .",
    "one underlying difficulty is that several elasticity tensors may represent the same linear anisotropic elastic material in different orientations .",
    "more precisely , any change of orientation of a material specified by some rotation @xmath0 defines a new elasticity tensor @xmath1 deduced from the previous one by some _ group action _",
    "@xmath2 where einstein convention on repeated indices is used . as the material is rotated the tensor @xmath3 moves on its _ orbit _ in the space @xmath4 of elasticity tensors .",
    "thus , a linear elastic material is represented by the _ orbit _ of an elasticity tensor under this group action , and any intrinsic parameter is necessary an _ invariant _ of this group action .    in a seminal paper , boehler  kirilov  onat",
    "@xcite emphasized the fundamental role played by polynomial _",
    "invariants _ of the elasticity tensor and which have been used by auffray  kolev ",
    "petitot  @xcite to classify the orbits of the elasticity tensor .",
    "the old problem of finding a basis of polynomial invariants for the fourth order elasticity tensor was finally solved by olive in 2014  @xcite after several attempts  @xcite .",
    "a _ minimal integrity basis of @xmath5 invariants _ for this space was definitively obtained in  @xcite .",
    "note that in 2d , this integrity basis is composed by only @xmath6 invariants  @xcite , which shows the incredible complexity of 3d linear elasticity compared to 2d case . in 3d",
    ", the problem can not be reduced as finding an integrity basis of second - order tensor - valued functions .",
    "two main tools have been used to solve this extremely difficult computational problem .",
    "the first one is the so - called _ harmonic decomposition _ which corresponds to the splitting of the elasticity tensor into _ irreducible pieces _",
    "@xcite which was first achieved by backus in 1970  @xcite .",
    "such a decomposition is useful to compute the _ material symmetry classes _  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , it has been used also in the study of effective elastic properties of cracked media  @xcite and  without explicit reference to it  in the homogenization techniques of laminated composites @xcite . note that in the later case , the polar decomposition method for 2d media has been used @xcite , while its equivalence with 2d harmonic decomposition has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "the second one is a purely mathematical tool , _ binary forms _ , which was the cornerstone of invariant theory in the nineteenth century  @xcite and is connected to spinors .",
    "this tool has been brought first to the knowledge of the mechanical community by backus  @xcite , and then by boehler  kirilov ",
    "onat  @xcite but its deep power did not seem to have been widely considered so far .",
    "it happens to be extremely useful for solving problems in tensor analysis for higher order tensors in 3d .",
    "for instance , this tool was used by auffray  olive  @xcite to produce a minimal integrity basis for a traceless and totally symmetric third order tensor , which appears in piezoelectricity  @xcite and second - gradient strain elasticity theory  @xcite .",
    "note , furthermore , that applications of binary forms are not just bounded to questions in continuum mechanics but are also related to other fields such as quantum computation  @xcite and cryptography  @xcite .",
    "the harmonic decomposition of the elasticity tensor produces a quintuple @xmath7 where @xmath8 are scalar invariants , @xmath9 are second order traceless tensors and @xmath10 is a _",
    "fourth order harmonic tensor_. the scalar and second order tensor components are linearly related to the voigt and the dilatation tensors , the two independent traces of the elasticity tensor .",
    "the irreducible fourth order component remains problematic in the study the elasticity tensor .",
    "in the present work , we try to go further in the representation of the harmonic fourth order component @xmath10 .",
    "we propose to introduce a secondary decomposition of this tensor , which was first discovered by sylvester  @xcite and now known as _ maxwell multipoles _ ( see also  @xcite ) , through a binary operation called _ harmonic product _ ( a commutative and associative product directly inherited from the product of binary forms ) .",
    "this decomposition aims ideally to reduce @xmath10 to a family of vectors , the maxwell multipoles , or , as detailed next , to reduce @xmath10 to a family of second order tensors .",
    "in 2d , the factorization of the harmonic component @xmath10 by means of second order tensors was already established in  @xcite , it results from the decomposition of elasticity tensor by verchery s polar method @xcite . besides , this factorization has the good taste to be _ equivariant _ , which means that it commutes with the action of the rotation group .",
    "however , the solution in 3d of such a decomposition  _ i.e. _ the four maxwell multipoles or in an equivalent manner the two second order tensors that factorize @xmath10  is far from being unique and constructive and is thus of poor value in practice .",
    "moreover , there are no global _ equivariant section _ of such mappings .",
    "we concentrate therefore on producing an _ equivariant explicit solution _ of the problem that we call a _ reconstruction _ and which are limited to specific symmetry classes .",
    "this process uses the concept of _ covariants _ , which generalizes the idea of invariants but which are tensors ( rather than scalars ) depending in an equivariant manner of the original tensor . for obvious reasons ,",
    "no such reconstruction can be globally defined .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , only triclinic , monoclinic , orthotropic , transversely isotropic and isotropic classes have a chance to be reconstructed using second - order covariants .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain for the first time explicit reconstruction formulas in the orthotropic and the transversely isotropic cases , using _ polynomial _",
    "second - order harmonic covariants and rational invariants .",
    "moreover , to overpass the geometrical constraints in the trigonal and in the tetragonal cases , we establish for these symmetry classes reconstruction formulas by means of second order covariants up to a single _ cubic fourth order covariant remainder_.    the considered reconstruction problem is closely related to the so - called _ isotropic extension _ of anisotropic constitutive functions via structural tensors developed by boehler  @xcite and liu  @xcite independently ( see also  @xcite ) . in the case of a _ linear constitutive law _ , an isotropic extension is just an _ equivariant reconstruction _ _ limited to a given symmetry class _ of the constitutive tensor .",
    "furthermore , our approach is more constructive since we are able to give _ explicit equivariant formulas _ in which the `` structural tensors '' are polynomial covariant tensors of the constitutive tensor .      in section",
    "[ sec : tensorial - representations ] , we recall basic materials on tensorial representations of the orthogonal group , recalling the link between totally symmetric tensor and homogeneous polynomials and the harmonic decomposition . in section  [ sec : harmonic - factorization ] , we introduce the _ harmonic product _ between harmonic polynomials and formulate an harmonic factorisation theorem which proof is postponed in appendix  [ sec : annexe_sylvester - theorem - proof ] . the general reconstruction problem is formulated in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] , where a geometric obstruction for an equivariant reconstruction of fourth - order tensors , by means of second order polynomial covariants is explained .",
    "explicit reconstructions formulas , using rational invariants and second order polynomial covariants are obtained in section  [ sec : second - order - covariants ] for transversely isotropic and orthotropic tensors . in section  [ sec : other - results ] , we propose similarly equivariant reconstructions for tetragonal and trigonal fourth order harmonic tensors up to a cubic covariant remainder .      the following spaces are involved :    * @xmath4 : the space of _ elasticity tensors _ ; * @xmath11 : the space of @xmath12-th order tensors on @xmath13 ; * @xmath14 : the space of @xmath12-th order _ totally symmetric tensors _ on @xmath13 ; * @xmath15 : the space of @xmath12-th order _ harmonic tensors _ on @xmath13 ; * @xmath16 : the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 ; * @xmath17 : the space of _ harmonic polynomials _ of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 ; * @xmath18 : the space of binary forms of degree @xmath12 on @xmath19 ; * @xmath20 : the space of binary forms of degree @xmath21 which correspond to real harmonic tensors of degree @xmath12 .    in addition",
