    "the momentum of light in a medium is a long - lasting controversial  question  in  physics .",
    "abraham  and minkowski , respectively , proposed a formulation of light momentum .",
    "abraham momentum is inversely proportional   to   the   refractive  index  of  medium ,  while the minkowski s is directly proportional to the index .",
    "experiments were claimed to support both abraham s @xcite and minkowski s @xcite .",
    "barnett and loudon assert that the early experiments by walker _",
    "_ @xcite `` provide evidence that is no less convincing in favor of the abraham form '' @xcite .",
    "but feigel insists that `` as far as we know , there are no experimental data that demonstrate the inverse dependence of the radiation pressure on the refractive index '' @xcite ; in other words , no experimental observations of light momentum are quantitatively in agreement with the formulation given by abraham . the recent direct fiber - recoiling observation by she _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which was claimed to support the abraham momentum , is also thought to be `` not uncontroversial '' @xcite .",
    "+ light momentum has been widely investigated , even for all different kinds of dielectric materials , including magnetic @xcite and dispersive @xcite , but no agreement has been reached about which formulation is correct .",
    "comprehensive presentations of the abraham - minkowski controversy are given in some review papers such as in @xcite , where there are a lot of valuable references collected .",
    "+ maxwell equations support various forms of momentum conservation equations , which is a kind of indeterminacy .",
    "however it is the indeterminacy that results in the question of light momentum . to find out which formulation of light momentum in a medium is correct ,",
    "various theories have been proposed . + ( 1 ) _ laue - mller",
    "theory_. laue and mller proposed a theory where four - vector covariance is imposed on the electromagnetic ( em ) energy velocity in a moving medium @xcite .",
    "laue - mller theory supports minkowski em tensor and momentum , because the minkowski tensor is a real four - tensor while abraham s is not , as indicated by veselago and shchavlev recently @xcite .",
    "but brevik disagrees , criticizing that such a theory is only `` a test of a tensor s _ convenience _ rather than its _ correctness _ '' @xcite . + ( 2 )",
    "_ pfeifer - coworkers theory_. pfeifer and coworkers claim that the `` division of the total energy - momentum tensor into electromagnetic and material components is arbitrary '' @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the em part and the material part in the total momentum can be arbitrarily distributed as long as the total momentum is kept the same .",
    "+ ( 3 ) _ mansuripur - zakharian theory_. mansuripur and zakharian argue that for em radiation waves , poynting vector represents em power flow ( energy flow ) in any system of materials , and they claim that the abraham momentum is `` the sole electromagnetic momentum in any system of materials distributed throughout the free space '' @xcite .",
    "+ ( 4 ) _ barnett s theory_. in a recent letter , barnett argues that the medium einstein - box thought experiment ( also known as `` balazs thought experiment '' ) supports abraham momentum while the photon - atom doppler resonance absorption experiment supports minkowski momentum , and claims that both abraham and minkowski momentums are correct : one is kinetic , and the other is canonical @xcite .",
    "+ pfeifer - coworkers theory supports `` arbitrary '' em momentums @xcite while barnett s theory supports both abraham and minkowski momentums @xcite .",
    "laue - mller theory only supports minkowski momentum @xcite while mansuripur - zakharian theory only supports abraham momentum @xcite .    clearly , it is an insufficiency of the pfeifer - coworkers theory @xcite that the em momentum in a medium can not be uniquely determined .",
    "photons are the carriers of em momentum for radiation em waves . according to pfeifer - coworkers theory",
    ", the momentum of a specific photon in a medium could be abraham s , minkowski s , or even arbitrary ; thus leading to the momentum not having a determinate value .    in barnett s theory",
    "@xcite , the argument for supporting abraham momentum is based on the analysis of einstein - box  thought  experiment  by  the  `` center - of - mass - energy '' approach , where global momentum - energy conservation law is employed to obtain abraham photon momentum and energy in the medium box in lab frame @xcite . at first sight ,",
    "such an approach is indeed impeccable .",
    "however on second thoughts , one may find that the approach itself has implicitly assumed the abraham momentum to be the correct momentum ; thus leaving readers an open question : do the abraham momentum and energy obtained still satisfy the global momentum - energy conservation law in all inertial frames of reference so that the argument is consistent with the principle of relativity ?",
    "laue - mller theory imposes four - vector covariance on the em energy velocity in a moving medium , where the energy velocity is defined as poynting vector divided by em energy density @xcite .",
    "obviously , the poynting vector is assumed to be the em power flow in the moving medium .",
    "in mansuripur - zakharian theory , the poynting vector is also assumed to be the em power flow in any system of materials @xcite .",
    "the two theories have the same basic assumption , but they result in completely different physical conclusions : minkowski momentum is the unique momentum for laue - mller theory , while abraham momentum is the unique momentum for mansuripur - zakharian theory . from this , one may have every reason to question the justification of the assumption used in their theories : does the poynting vector really represent the em power flow in any system of materials , including the moving medium ?",
    "in fact , there is another interesting question in laue - mller theory .",
    "the laue - mller theory assumes poynting vector as the em power flow ( energy flow ) .",
    "since the photon is the carrier of the em energy and momentum , the minkowski momentum which the theory solely supports is supposed to be parallel to the poynting vector .",
    "however the minkowski momentum and poynting vector are not parallel in general in a moving medium [ confer eqs .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] ) in the present paper ] ; resulting in a serious contradiction between the basic assumption and conclusion .",
    "from above analysis we can see that there are flaws in the existing theories .",
    "thus the crux of the matter is to set up a self - consistent theory .",
    "this theory must be based on a most fundamental postulate , which constitutes an additional condition imposed on physical laws , so that the light momentum can be uniquely determined .",
    "such a postulate is the principle of relativity : the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference @xcite .",
    "this principle is a restriction but also is a guide in formulating physical theories . according to this principle",
    ", there is _ no preferred _ inertial frame for descriptions of physical phenomena .",
    "for example , maxwell equations , global momentum and energy conservation laws , fermat s principle , and einstein light - quantum hypothesis are equally valid in all inertial frames , no matter whether the medium is moving or at rest , and no matter whether the space is fully or partially filled with a medium .    in this paper , a self - consistent theory is developed based on the principle of relativity for a plane wave in a moving non - dispersive , lossless , non - conducting , isotropic uniform medium , which can uniquely determine the light momentum . in this physical model ,",
    "photons are introduced by einstein light - quantum hypothesis ; however , the motion of photons is treated classically through the principle of fermat , namely all photons are assumed to propagate along light rays . by analysis of the plane wave ,",
    "important unconventional conclusions are obtained , which are outlined below .",
    "* there may be a pseudo - power flow when a medium moves , and the poynting vector does not necessarily denote the em power flow .",
    "this conclusion explains why the laue - mller and mansuripur - zakharian theories use the same assumption but result in different physical results . *",
    "minkowski light momentum and energy constitute a lorentz four - vector in a form of single photon or single em - field cell , and planck constant is a lorentz invariant .",
    "this conclusion has been applied to analysis of einstein - box thought experiment , revealing why the argument for abraham momentum in barnett s theory is not consistent with the principle of relativity @xcite .",
    "* there is no momentum transfer taking place between the plane wave and the uniform medium , and the em momentum conservation equation can not be uniquely determined without resort to the principle of relativity .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the einstein - box thought experiment analyzed by em boundary - condition matching approach , where the leading and trailing light pulse edges in a medium box do not produce additional lorentz force , and both abraham and minkowski momentums satisfy the em boundary conditions on the vacuum - medium interface @xcite .",
    "* when the medium moves opposite to the wave vector at a faster - than - dielectric light speed , negative frequency and negative em energy density occur , with the plane wave becoming left - handed . in such a case , minkowski light momentum , poynting vector (= em power flow ) , and the wave vector have the same direction , while the phase velocity is opposite to the poynting vector because the frequency is negative .",
    "it should be noted that the application of relativity principle is very tricky , not just manipulating lorentz transformations .",
    "for example , when applying this principle to maxwell equations in free space , one may directly obtain the constancy of light speed @xcite ; when applying it to analysis of abraham photon momentum in einstein - box thought experiment , one may find that the abraham momentum must have exactly the same form in all inertial frames @xcite ; both without any need of lorentz transformations .",
    "+ according to the principle of relativity , the phase function for a plane wave [ confer eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ] has the same form in all inertial frames .",
    "from this we can directly obtain an important light - momentum criterion :    * the momentum of light in a medium ( including empty space ) is parallel to the wave vector in all inertial frames .    the argument for this criterion",
    "is given below .",
    "+ from einstein light - quantum hypothesis , photons are the carriers of light momentum and energy . thus the direction of motion of photons is the propagation direction of the light momentum and energy .",
    "the phase function defines equi - phase planes of motion ( wavefronts ) , with the wave vector as the normal vector . from one equi - phase plane to another equi - phase plane , the path parallel to the normal vector is the shortest and it has the minimum optical length . according to fermat s principle , light follows the path of least time , and this path is an actual light ray .",
    "thus the direction of motion of the photons must be parallel to the wave vector , and so must the light momentum .",
    "since the phase function is invariant in form , this property of light momentum must be valid in all inertial frames .",
    "+ in some literature , the momentum of light in a medium is defined as the total momentum , namely the sum of em part and mechanical part @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the light momentum is defined as single photon momentum or em momentum . according to this definition ,",
    "the single photon momentum is the direct result of einstein light - quantized em momentum .",
    "+ it should be emphasized that the principle of relativity is the backbone of the theory developed in the present paper .",
    "one might insist that the medium should define a _ preferred _ inertial frame of reference so that there is _ no _ reason why the fermat s principle is valid in all inertial frames .",
    "for example , ravndal suggested a _",
    "preferred _ lorentz transformation when a dielectric medium exists @xcite .",
    "however in this paper , the principle of relativity is taken as a fundamental postulate no matter with or without the existence of a medium , and the standard lorentz transformation @xcite is assumed to be universal . + the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , refractive index , phase velocity ( photon velocity ) , and group velocity are defined for a plane wave in a moving uniform medium . in sec .",
    "iii , single photon momentum is analyzed . in sec .",

    "v , some conclusions and remarks are given .",

    "mackay and lakhtakia concluded that , a plane wave with a _ positive _ phase velocity , observed in the medium - rest frame , may become a plane wave with the _ negative _ phase velocity observed in moving frames @xcite .",
    "mackay - lakhtakia s conclusion is clearly supported by the example given in the present paper , as indicated above .",
    "however it should be noted that in all those analyses @xcite , the frequency is always taken to be positive , and thus the negative frequency and negative em energy density appearing in the superluminal medium , presented in the present paper , have never been clearly exposed , and their physics has never been formulated .",
    "an electromagnetic plane wave , although not practical , is a simplest strict solution of maxwell equations , and it is often used to explore most fundamental physics . for example , einstein used a plane wave to develop his special theory of relativity and derived the well - known relativistic doppler formula in free space @xcite . in this paper , we use the plane wave , which propagates in a moving non - dispersive , lossless , non - conducting , isotropic uniform medium , to identify which formulation of light momentum is correct .",
    "we have shown that ( a ) minkowski light momentum and energy constitute a lorentz four - vector , while abraham momentum and energy do not , and ( b ) observed in any inertial frames , minkowski em momentum @xmath347 always take the direction of the wave vector @xmath29 , while the abraham momentum @xmath385 does not , unless in free space or when the dielectric medium moves parallel to the wave vector , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] ) .",
    "the minkowski momentum is completely consistent with fermat s principle and the principle of relativity , and it is the unique correct light momentum .    the photon momentum - energy four - vector @xmath386 is constructed based on the wave four - vector combined with einstein light - quantum hypothesis , while the em momentum - energy four - vector @xmath387 is constructed based on the lorentz covariance of em field - strength tensors @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( to keep maxwell equations invariant in form in all inertial frames ) @xcite , where @xmath388 and @xmath389 are , respectively , the momentum and energy for a `` single em - field cell '' . when einstein light - quantum hypothesis @xmath390 is imposed on the latter , the latter is restored to the former , namely @xmath391 , with the `` single em - field cell '' becoming `` single photon '' .",
    "thus the single photon momentum is the direct result of einstein light - quantized em momentum . in other words ,",
    "the monochromatic plane wave is an identical - photon model , in which every photon has the same momentum and energy so that the light - wave momentum has the exact and simplest definition .",

    "in fact , through seeking the resolution we have clarified and developed some basic concepts and principles in electrodynamics and special relativity , which are outlined below .",
    "+ ( 1 ) we have set up a light - momentum criterion for the first time , which states that , the momentum of light in a medium ( including empty space ) is parallel to the wave vector in all inertial frames .",
    "this criterion is the direct result of the principle of relativity and fermat s principle for a plane wave . in a dielectric medium ( not including the empty space ) ,",
    "minkowski momentum satisfies the criterion while abraham momentum does not ; thus the minkowski momentum is the unique correct light momentum . in the empty space , minkowski and abraham",
    "momentums are equal , and both satisfy the criterion .",
    "+ it is worthwhile to point out that this light - momentum criterion provides a necessary _ physical _ condition to find out whether a _",
    "mathematical _ expression can represent correct momentum of light .",

    "+ conventionally , em momentum - energy stress tensor is used to define em momentum of light in a medium .",
    "minkowski first developed his em tensor , corresponding to minkowski momentum @xmath233 , and later , abraham also suggested an em tensor , corresponding to abraham momentum @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "it is generally argued that maxwell equations are manifestly lorentz covariant while the em tensor follows from the maxwell equations ; thus the em momentum defined from the em tensor certainly respects the principle of relativity .",
    "however it should be indicated that such an argument is based on an incomplete understanding of the relativity principle . the reason is given below .",
    "+ relativity principle states that physical laws are the same in all inertial frames of reference .",
    "a physical law has its specific physical implication and usually it is expressed through mathematical equations .",
    "thus the relativity principle requires that the mathematical equations describing the law must be the same in form in all inertial frames , and the specific physical implication of the equations also must be the same .",
    "as far as the _ mathematical expression _ concerned , @xmath233 and @xmath261 , which respectively satisfy their own momentum conservation equations , are both lorentz covariant together with maxwell equations ( namely the same mathematical forms in all frames ) ; however , as far as the _ physical implication _ concerned , only @xmath233 is lorentz covariant ( the same physical implication in all frames ) while @xmath261 is not ( not the same physical implication in all frames ) .",
    "that is because @xmath233 meets the light - momentum criterion while @xmath261 does not .",
    "+ ( 2 ) in conventional em wave theory , poynting vector @xmath77 as em power flow has been thought to be a well - established basic concept . in view of the existence of some kind of mathematical ambiguity for this concept , some scientists suggested it to be a `` postulate '' @xcite , or `` hypothesis '' , `` until a clash with new experimental evidence shall call for its revision '' ( see p. 135 of ref .",
