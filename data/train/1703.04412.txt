    "the study of solar flares is high priority research area in the international heliophysics community . understanding the physics of these explosive events is not only crucial for the field of space weather , but also in the broader scope of astrophysics where similar processes are believed to occur in stellar flares , black hole accretion disks , and in the earth s magnetotail .",
    "solar physics is fortunate to have access to a great deal of data from many solar observatories , both in space and on the ground .",
    "these instruments provide imaging , photometric , and spectroscopic data over a range of wavelengths , from radio waves through the optical and euv to x - rays and gamma - rays : often the greatest advances in our understanding of solar flares come through various combinations of these datasets .",
    "it is difficult to keep track of which flares have been observed by which instruments . while most currently operational missions have their own individual flare lists ( e.g. hinode flare catalog ; @xcite or sdo / eve ; @xcite ) , it was only recently that the first inter - instrument catalog became available , hosted by njit @xcite . the max millennium program for solar flare research ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and others have aimed to coordinate ground and space based instrumentation to observe a flaring active region simultaneously .",
    "however , this can be difficult due to factors such as coordinating across multiple time zones , planning schedules being uploaded days in advance , ground - based seeing conditions , competing scientific priorities , and so on .",
    "therefore when a solar flare is known to have been observed by a combination of instruments , the event can receive considerable attention as a consequence .",
    "a notable recent example of this is the 29 march 2014 x - class flare which was successfully observed by an `` unprecedented '' combination of instruments both in orbit and on the ground according to a nasa press release .",
    "consequently there have been 22 refereed publications that discuss this flare , according to a nasa ads fulltext search on the keyword `` sol2014 - 03 - 29 '' ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the first x - class flare of solar cycle 24 ( sol2011 - 02 - 15 ) was simultaneously observed by multiple instruments at high cadence , resulting in 40 refereed publications at time of writing ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "clearly there is great scientific merit in multi - instrument observations of the same event .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of flare statistics by retrospectively cross - referencing metadata from a suite of instruments that take flare - relevant observations - the ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; @xcite ) , the multiple euv grating spectrograph ( megs ; @xcite ) -a and -b components of the euv variability experiment ( eve ; @xcite ) , the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ; @xcite ) , the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) , and the interface region imaging spectrometer ( iris ; @xcite ) - to search for flaring events observed simultaneously , either intentionally or serendipitously .",
    "the purpose is to present an overview on how successful the solar community has been in capturing flare data through coordinated efforts .",
    "we also describe a searchable database of these events that give researchers access to multi - wavelength datasets with which to address a given science question .",
    "section  [ s : data_anal ] describes how the various archives from each instrument considered were exploited .",
    "section  [ s : results ] presents the findings , while section  [ s : idl_widget ] describes an interactive widget accessible through sswidl .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section  [ s : conc ] .",

    "field of view estimated at 240 by 240 arcsec@xmath0 , one quarter the full fov of eis .",
    "field of view estimated at 200 by 200 arcsec@xmath0 , one quarter the full fov of sot .",
    "field of view estimated at 1024 by 1024 arcsec@xmath0 , one quarter the full fov of xrt .",

    "[ tab : estimated_flares ]    the findings of how many solar flares were observed by different combinations of instruments are displayed in figures  [ upset_dec_freq ] and  [ upset_inc_deg ] as upset r plots @xcite .",
    "this type of plot enables the efficient visualization of common elements of a large number of sets ( the more common and familiar venn diagram approach produces ineffective visualizations for more than @xmath15 sets ) .",
    "figure  [ upset_dec_freq ] shows the intersections of the various combinations of dataset ordered by decreasing frequency ( i.e. the most common combinations are on the left and decrease towards the right ) .",
    "figure  [ upset_inc_deg ] shows the same information only now ordered by increasing degree ( i.e. flares observed by individual instruments alone come first , with flares observed by all seven on the far right ) . in each figure , the total number of flares observed by each instrument are given by the horizontal black bars in the bottom left corner .",
    "the dots connected by lines at the bottom of each figure denote the combinations of instruments considered , while the histograms above give the number of events corresponding to a given combination .",
    "the most common combination of flare datasets was rhessi+megs - a+hinode / xrt ( 930 flares ) , due to their large fields of view and high duty cycles as mentioned above .",
    "it is difficult to give a good estimate of how many flares one would _",
    "expect _ to see with each instrument , given their different science goals and operational constraints .",
    "table [ tab : estimated_flares ] summarizes an attempt to estimate this expectation value for each instrument considered in this paper .",
    "the estimates are based on estimated average field - of - views times the duty cycles of each instrument .",
    "the area of consideration is estimated in two ways .",
    "the first estimate is simply the area of the full disk of the sun .",
    "the second estimate assumes that there are four active regions on the sun each with an area of 240arcsec@xmath0 , and that the majority of the duty cycle is spent examining the active region areas .",
    "these two estimates give an upper and lower range to the percentage field of view .",
    "the percentage field of view is calculated as the percentage of the area of consideration covered by the average field - of - view of the instrument disk .",
    "the duty cycle is estimated as the percentage time the instrument could have observed a flare .",
    "crucially , the estimates assume that a _ random _ location within the area of consideration ( either the full disk of the sun , or an estimated average area of active regions that the instrument could point to , assuming that active regions form the majority of target areas during the duty cycle ) . comparing these very crude estimates to the results shown in table [ tab : instr_flares ]",
    ", it can be seen that each pointing instruments is performing well .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the probability of all seven instruments targeting the same flare independently , then multiplying the individual expected values gives us a probability of @xmath20.001% .",
    "therefore the measured value of 0.3% is actually considerably better than what one might expect for such a fortuitous combination of observations .",
    "this reflects the fact that solar flares are a high priority science goal for these instrument , and that operators of course do not point their instruments randomly .",
    "the list of solar flares used for the above analysis were used as the source data for the solar flare finder , a widget that allows users to search for flares observed by a chosen set of instruments .",
    "the solar flare finder widget is available now via solarsoft / idl ( @xcite ; idl > solar_flare_finder ) .",
    "a screenshot is shown in figure  [ sff_idl ] .",
    "the widget searches a pre - generated lookup table ( the same lookup table used to generate the upset r plots above , only with b - class flares included ) to return goes events simultaneously observed by selected instruments . the widget allows the user to search by goes class ( b , c , m , x ) , flare location ( disk ; @xmath3 - 600@xmath2 + 600  or limb ; @xmath2 - 600@xmath3 + 600  ) , percentage of the rise phase covered by rhessi ( @xmath30% or @xmath390% ) , and by the maximum energy recorded by rhessi . the widget returns a list of flare conforming to the users specifications ( if any ) , allowing the user to click on a desired event to bring up a plot similar to that shown in figure  [ sff_plot ] that displays the metadata from all available datasets .",
    "these plots , and the associated metadata , are downloadable , and are hosted at http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov / sff/.",
    "a statistical analysis of how many solar flares ( @xmath4c1 ) were observed by various combinations of instruments during the 6.5 years after the launch of sdo in solar cycle 24 are presented . out of the 6,953 flares considered ,",
    "only 3 were observed simultaneously by rhessi , megs - a+b , hinode / eis+sot+xrt and iris : a c2.3 flare on 1 february 2014 , a c4.6 flare on 3 february 2014 , and an m1.5 flare on 4 february 2014 .",
    "note that all seven instruments were observing contemporaneously for only 11 months , and in this time 934 events are currently listed as ssw latest events ; therefore 0.3%  of all possible goes flares were observed with all seven instruments . on average , each flare was observed by 2.4 instruments .    the paucity of events co - observed by multiple , complementary instruments points to the challenge of observing solar flares _ in flagrente delicto_. without a reliable method of predicting when and where a solar flare will occur , we are left with trying to optimize instrumental resources in the face of incomplete information as well as each instruments operational constraints and competing scientific priorities .",
    "the max millennium program aims to provide an assessment of the likelihood of a flare in a given region over the following 24 hours . as well as a human assessment of flare likelihood",
    ", we suggest that modern machine learning techniques be employed as another tool to aid the human flare forecaster .",
    "for example , @xcite use support vector machine methods to determine flare probabilities .",
    "another possible approach is to aggregate results from all existing flare prediction tools to provide a single , combined measure assessing flare likelihood .",
    "it is also fundamentally important that support for the basic science of understanding how and why a solar flare is triggered continues .",
    "understanding how a solar flare operates is a fundamental challenge to our understanding of the sun and the conditions of the heliosphere . in the upcoming solar cycle 25",
    ", the daniel k. inouye solar telescope , solar orbiter , solar probe plus will all be operational .",
    "these facilities all have limited duty cycles , and different operational constraints .",
    "optimizing the solar flare science return from these and other instruments relies on improved inter - instrument co - ordination .",
    "we suggest that each instrument s observational plans be made available online , ideally in a commonly agreed format .",
    "tools should be developed to read and visualize those plans ( the helioviewer project clients helioviewer.org and jhelioviewer could be extended to present observation plans ) that could take into account solar differential rotation , overplotting it on images from many different instruments .",
    "this will enable instrument operators , scientists and other users to understand how and why particular observations are being planned .",
    "we suggest that increased planning transparency will inevitably lead to an increased understanding of how an instrument s operations create the _ actual _ science priorities of an instrument , as opposed to its _ stated _ priorities . from this basis",
    "a better understanding of how to co - ordinate co - observations between instruments can be generated .",
    "finally , it should be noted that co - observation of _ non - flaring _ regions is also of considerable scientific value .",
    "co - observations that do not catch a flare are not without value ; much can be learned about the physics of active regions , the chromospheric - coronal connection , polarity inversion lines , sunspots , etc , using observations from multiple instruments .",
