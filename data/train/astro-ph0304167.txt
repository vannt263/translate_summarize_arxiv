    "measuring polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become one of the main goals of cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "a cmb polarization field can be decomposed into an electric - type @xmath0 mode and a magnetic - type @xmath1 mode @xcite . recently ,",
    "the dasi instrument , a ground - based interferometric array with degree - scale resolution , has detected the cmb @xmath0-polarization and @xmath2 cross - correlation , while setting an upper limit on the @xmath1-polarization @xcite .",
    "most recently , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe has measured the @xmath2 power spectrum @xcite , which is consistent with theoretical predictions based on the measured cmb anisotropy and indicates a significant large - scale @xmath0-polarization .",
    "the cmb polarization contains a wealth of information about the early universe . on small scales",
    "the @xmath0-polarization can serve as an independent test of the physics taking place on the last scattering surface @xcite , while on large scales providing a sensitive test of the re - ionization history of the universe @xcite .",
    "it can cross - check the measured anisotropy power spectrum and improve the accuracy in determining the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 mode is a unique probe of the presence of large - scale gravitational waves , a prediction of inflationary models @xcite",
    ". a detection of the @xmath1 mode would be essential for reconstructing the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "on smaller scales , measuring secondary @xmath1 modes generated from gravitational lensing could provide information about the clustering of cosmic matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the separation of the observed polarization into @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes is a prerequisite for extracting useful information from data .",
    "it is clear that there would be no @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing if we have a full - sky map with infinite resolution .",
    "however , for a finite sky patch observed in a single - dish experiment , a substantial leakage between @xmath0 and @xmath1 was found on large angular scales when using a quadratic estimator method for measuring the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power spectra @xcite .",
    "this leakage is caused by ambiguous modes that receive contributions to their power from both @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of aliasing of small - scale power due to the map pixelization is another source of leakage , which could be a serious problem because the cmb polarization power spectrum is expected to be extremely blue . as a result , to achieve the same level of contamination by aliased power , one has to oversample the polarization map 2 to 3 times more than the temperature map @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the effects of finite size and pixelization to @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing but in interferometry experiments .",
    "an interferometric array is intrinsically a high - resolution polarimetric instrument well suited for observing small - scale polarized intensity fluctuations , while being flexible in coverage of a wide range of angular scales with the resolution and sensitivity determined by the aperture of each element of the array and the baselines formed by the array elements . being ground - based , it is controllable and it can track the sky for an extensive period of time , as practiced successfully by the dasi team in measuring the cmb @xmath0-polarization @xcite .",
    "observational strategies of cmb interferometry experiments such as dasi , cbi , vsa , and amiba can be found in @xcite and references therein .    if the dual - polarization feeds of an interferometer measure the right and left circular polarizations , the output will be the four correlations : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . they can be related to stokes parameters @xmath7 by their associated visibility functions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . henceforth , we assume @xmath12 because cmb is expected to have no circular polarization . in typical interferometric measurements ,",
    "the observation wavelength @xmath13 is much smaller than the diameter of a dish @xmath14 .",
    "so , the sky can be treated as flat , being spanned by a two - dimensional vector @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the visibility is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the stokes parameter multiplied by the primary beam , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the two - dimensional projection vector ( in unit of wavelength ) of the baseline between two dishes in the @xmath15-plane , @xmath18 is a pointing position on the sky , @xmath19 is a conversion factor from temperature to intensity dependent on the observation frequency @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24 field given by @xmath25   e^{\\pm i2\\phi_{\\bf u } } e^{-2\\pi i{\\bf u}\\cdot { \\bf x } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the phase in the fourier space given by the direction angle of @xmath17 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath30 defined in the @xmath17-plane can be related to the angular power spectrum @xmath31 defined on the sphere by @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "to estimate cmb polarization band powers , we use a quadratic estimator based on the maximum likelihood analysis , defined as @xcite @xmath34 ,      \\label{qe}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the visibility data vector composed of measured @xmath36 and @xmath37 quantities , @xmath38 is the sum of signal and noise covariance matrices ( @xmath39 , see below for the definition of a covariance matrix ) , and @xmath40 is the fisher information matrix defined as @xmath41 by using the newton - raphson method , after several iterations we can find a set of band powers that most likely fits the data and thus maximizes the likelihood function . to quantify the sensitivity of each band power to the cmb power spectrum , we use the band power window functions defined as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 . the window function @xmath44 for the @xmath45-th band should have a property of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the measured band power from the quadratic estimator , and @xmath48 .",
    "those band powers intrinsically bear anti - correlations among themselves due to the partial sky coverage and the complex noise property of the experiment . by performing a linear transformation with a transformation matrix as given by the hermitian square root of the fisher matrix @xmath49",
    ", we can get a set of decorrelated band powers and the corresponding window functions @xcite , @xmath50 the size of the error bar for each decorrelated band power is obtained from @xmath51    following @xcite , we define @xmath52 leakage matrix @xmath53 for each band , with components given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote @xmath0 or @xmath1 modes , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the minimum ( maximum ) @xmath59-sensitivity limit of the experiment considered . here",
    "@xmath60 is a part of @xmath0 mode band power window function ( @xmath61 ) that is sensitive to the power leaked from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , @xmath62 from @xmath0 to itself , and likewise for other combinations . if there is no leakage @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 . as a quantitative measure of leakage between @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we use the ratios of unwanted to wanted contributions , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite . in the next subsections",
    "we discuss the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes in each strategy .      in the _ single - pointing _ strategy , a single field on the sky",
    "is tracked for a long period of time .",
    "this is appropriate for an interferometer that has uniform @xmath17-coverage and sufficiently small primary @xmath17-beam size so as to cover a wide range of angular scales and resolve the structures in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "one can reduce sample variances by increasing the number of independent fields .",
    "this strategy has been adopted by the dasi and the cbi for deep observation of the cmb @xcite .",
    "let us consider a simple 2-element interferometer and choose the single pointing position @xmath68 without loss of generality , then @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given by @xmath69 e^{\\pm i2\\phi_{\\bf w}},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is assumed to be a symmetrical flat - illuminated feed horn , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the ensemble averages are a set of simultaneous integral equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 power spectra ( visibility covariance matrices ) : @xmath74 for a single - dish experiment , it gives ensemble averages @xmath75 simply given by equation  ( [ enavu ] ) with @xmath76 . because of the symmetrical @xmath77 , @xmath78 . as such ,",
    "the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is undetermined although @xmath79 measures the total polarization power",
    ". one should be cautious about the integration in @xmath75 for small @xmath80 ( or low @xmath59 ) where the flat - sky approximation is no longer reliable @xcite .",
    "however , full - sky two - point polarization correlation functions have been constructed @xcite , showing that the two - point correlation functions at zero lag , which are equivalent to @xmath75 , have similar properties . on the other hand , @xmath81 is non - vanishing in general for an interferometer , since a narrow range of @xmath82 can be sampled up to an uncertainty of the size of the dish .",
    "the information contained in it , which is orthogonal to @xmath83 , allows one to separate @xmath0 and @xmath1 powers in power spectrum estimation .",
    "figure 1 shows schematic diagrams showing different nature of fourier mode samplings in the @xmath84-space by the primary beam patterns for the single dish and the interferometer .",
    "big circles represent the sensitivity ranges set by the primary beams in the single - pointing strategy while the small circles denote the narrow synthesized beams that sample the fourier modes at particular locations in the mosaicking strategy . in the single - pointing strategy",
    ", a single dish intrinsically has a difficulty in sampling the phase due to the beam centered at the origin , which makes @xmath85 separation impossible . on the other hand ,",
    "the interferometer is more efficient in phase sampling because its beam is off - centered ( big circles in fig .",
    "thus the interferometer has better performance in separating @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "we can also understand this by considering an ideal case in which @xmath86 , then @xmath87 and hence equation  ( [ enavu ] ) becomes @xmath88 { 1 \\choose e^{i4\\phi_{\\bf u}}}$ ] from which @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes can be completely separated .",
    "to study the dish finite - size effect , we have performed a simulation of 60 independent single - pointing cmb observations using a 2-element interferometer operating at 95 ghz , with dishes of @xmath89 cm separated by 60 cm . in generating cmb fields , we simply assume a sine - shape power spectrum with a bump at @xmath90 and with @xmath1 mode having the same amplitude of @xmath0 mode , and adopt an instrumental noise level of 3 @xmath91k per visibility . we have measured the decorrelated band powers from the maximum likelihood analysis using equations ( [ qe ] ) and ( [ dcpow ] ) .",
    "the decorrelated band powers and the corresponding window functions defined in equation ( [ dcwin ] ) are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath92 ( 2nd row panels ) expresses contribution to the @xmath45-th @xmath0 mode band power from @xmath0 mode itself ( left ; @xmath62 ) and from @xmath1 mode powers ( right panel ; @xmath60 ) , and likewise for @xmath93 ( 3rd row panels ) .",
    "since the @xmath84-beam with @xmath94 is sufficiently narrow and at a rather long baseline of @xmath95 from the origin , @xmath96 can be sampled with a small error @xmath97 .",
    "the band power window function shows that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes have been cleanly separated with a leakage ratio of only @xmath98 as is expected .",
    "we have also investigated the extraction of the lensing induced @xmath1 mode from cmb polarization observations made by for example the forthcoming amiba experiment @xcite , which is an interferometric array of 7 elements that are hexagonally close - packed dishes of @xmath99 cm operating at 95 ghz with two 10 ghz channels and a system temperature of @xmath100 k. we have used the cmbfast code @xcite to generate the scalar - induced @xmath0 power spectrum and the lensing induced @xmath1 power spectrum in a flat reionized @xmath101cdm cosmological model with model parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . in a single - pointing observation made by the 7-element amiba for an integration time of one year , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes can be cleanly separated , the signal - to - noise ratio ( excluding sample variance ) for the @xmath0 polarization will be about 25 , while that for the lensing induced @xmath1 polarization will be about 2 . figure 3 shows the measured decorrelated band powers and the corresponding window functions .",
    "we have found rather high leakages from @xmath1 to @xmath0 which are given by @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) for the first ( second ) band .",
    "however , the lensing induced @xmath1 power spectrum is quite small such that the leakages do not make significant contamination to the measurement of the @xmath0 mode . on the contrary",
    ", although the leakages from @xmath0 to @xmath1 are only @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) for the first ( second ) band , the effective leakage power from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is at about 1 @xmath91k level , much higher than the genuine lensing induced @xmath1 power spectrum . in order to measure",
    "the lensing induced @xmath1 mode , one has to reduce @xmath67 to less than 0.01 .",
    "this can be done by reducing the size of the dish ( but then it will decrease the sensitivity ) or using the method of mosaicking as described below .      in the single - pointing strategy , the resolution in the @xmath17-space",
    "is limited by the area of the surveyed sky which is equal to the size of the primary beam . by _",
    "several contiguous pointings , we can increase the resolution in the @xmath17-space .",
    "this strategy is essential for close - packed interferometers such as the amiba and the cbi with @xmath17-beam size larger than the structure of the cmb power spectrum @xcite .    for a pair of pointing positions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , equation  ( [ enavu ] ) change into the visibility covariance matrices @xmath114 { 1 \\choose e^{i4\\phi_{\\bf w } } } \\label{enavum}\\ ] ] and the single - dish covariance matrices @xmath115 as given by equation  ( [ enavum ] ) with @xmath76 .",
    "here we see additional phases as a function of @xmath116 which can increase the resolution in @xmath84-space by mosaicking neighboring pointings , as illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "note that the interferometric primary beam actually samples the @xmath84-space peaked at @xmath117 which is the length of the baseline , and that we have chosen particular numbers and separations of pointings to produce similar effective beams . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the phases sampled are more reliable in mosaicking strategy due to the narrow synthesized beam in the @xmath84-space ( small circles ) .",
    "figure 5 shows an example of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization band power estimates expected in a 61-pointing hexagonal mosaic mock observation with pointing separation @xmath118 by the single dish with @xmath119 cm ( @xmath120 ghz ) .",
    "we have used the same sine - shape power spectrum in generating cmb polarization fields and made 60 independent mosaics to reduce the sample variance . in order to study the sample - variance limited regime ,",
    "we have adopted extremely low instrument noise , @xmath121 @xmath122 per pointing , to suppress the complications set in from noise .",
    "the total survey size per mosaic is about @xmath123 , thus the band width is chosen to be @xmath124 .",
    "the decorrelated band power window functions are also shown in the bottom panels of figure 5 .",
    "the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is significant at the first and last bands denoted respectively by the solid and dot - dashed curves .",
    "furthermore , both band power window functions at the first band , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , are rising up steeply in the direction of @xmath127 , which reflects that the single - dish instrument can not determine the phases @xmath128 near the origin in the @xmath84-space .",
    "similarly , the polarization band powers and the corresponding band power window functions expected in a 19-pointing hexagonal mosaic mock observation by the 2-element interferometer with @xmath99 cm and 5 cm separation ( @xmath120 ghz ) are shown in figure 6 . in this case",
    "@xmath129 is chosen in order to make the same survey size of @xmath123 , and the instrument noise is again assumed to be @xmath121 @xmath122 per visibility .",
    "unlike the case of single dish in figure 5 , there is no steep rise - up of the window functions near @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing at the first band is still large but smaller than that of the single - dish experiment , since it is just as difficult to determine @xmath128 at the first band .",
    "however , this band is already at the tail of the @xmath59-range sensitivity of the interferometer . on the contrary",
    ", a clean @xmath85 separation can be done at high @xmath59 region where a better sampling of @xmath128 is possible .",
    "note that the interferometer has a much better performance at the last band than the single dish mainly due to a higher sensitivity at that band .",
    "examples of mosaicking given above are too ideal to look into the practical issues .",
    "cases for realistic instrument noises and cmb power spectra should be investigated .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show results in the case of realistic instrument noise .",
    "we have assumed a noise level of 3 @xmath91k per pointing or visibility while the sine - shape power spectrum is still used .",
    "compared to the single dish , the interferometer gives @xmath0 and @xmath1 band power measurements with very large uncertainties .",
    "the interferometer considered here has about three times fewer pixels ( 19-pt ) than the single dish does ( 61-pt ) while the same noise level per pixel is assumed in both cases .",
    "therefore , the overall noise level is quite higher in the interferometry . in spite of this higher noise level ,",
    "the interferometer has better performance in separating @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes . for @xmath0-estimates in the single - dish experiment ( interferometry ) , the ratios of unwanted to wanted modes at the first and the last bands are @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 ( @xmath111 ) , respectively .",
    "figures 9 and 10 also show similar results in the case of realistic instrument noise but with @xmath101cdm power spectrum with zero @xmath1 mode power .",
    "the noise level is assumed to be 3 @xmath91k per pixel .",
    "we use the cmbfast power spectrum @xcite of a flat @xmath101cdm cosmological model with model parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "reionization has not been considered .",
    "the distinctive feature in the band power estimates is that at the first band a significant power leakage from @xmath0 to @xmath1 modes is seen , especially in the single - dish experiment ( fig .",
    "9 ; @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such leakage is relatively smaller in the interferometry ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) . in other words , in a situation of asymmetric shapes of power spectra between @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ( e.g. , @xmath101cdm case ) , one mode can be significantly contaminated by the other mode , especially in the single - dish experiment .",
    "figure 11 summarizes the level of @xmath85 mixing in terms of the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the single dish and the interferometer . here",
    "figures 11@xmath137 and 11@xmath45 correspond respectively to the cases of the sine - shape power spectrum with negligible noise ( figs . 5 and 6 ) and realistic noise ( figs . 7 and 8) ,",
    "while figure 11@xmath138 corresponds to that of the @xmath101cdm power spectrum and realistic noise ( figs . 9 and 10 )",
    ". the leakage drops with @xmath59 for the interferometer .",
    "however , for the single dish the leakage increases at higher @xmath59 due to @xmath85 mixing caused by sparse sampling of data points .",
    "this @xmath85 mixing can be removed by the dense data sampling during mosaicking or map - making process . on the other hand , the interferometer ,",
    "even with sparse data sampling scheme , does not experience large @xmath85 mixing . in figures 11@xmath137 and 11@xmath45",
    ", the leakage pattern from @xmath1 to @xmath0 is essentially equal to that from @xmath0 to @xmath1 because the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power spectra assumed are symmetric .",
    "however , there exists an effect of asymmetry between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mode power spectra in the @xmath101cdm case ( fig .",
    "11@xmath138 ) , where @xmath67 has a minus sign at the second band for the single - dish experiment .",
    "it should be also noted that at the last band both experiments have larger leakage ratios for the case of negligible noise ( fig .",
    "11@xmath137 ) than those for the case of realistic noise ( fig .",
    "11@xmath45 ) .",
    "this is because the window functions for negligible noise have very small sidelobes , while those for realistic noise have larger sidelobes fluctuating at the zero point and self - canceling , especially at the last band .",
    "we have pointed out that the separation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes in cmb measurements depends on how well the phase information of the cmb polarization in the fourier space is obtained .",
    "this has been shown by performing maximum - likelihood estimations of the band powers from mock single - dish data in comparison with that from an interferometer .",
    "being able to sample a narrow range of the phase by an individual pointing , the interferometer can separate @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes in a single - pointing measurement .",
    "this makes interferometry particularly attractive in the detection of extremely weak @xmath1 polarization signals such as the lensing induced @xmath1 mode and the gravity - wave induced @xmath1 mode . in mosaicking observation ,",
    "the interferometer is generally more efficient than the single dish in separating @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes . in the sample - variance limited cases",
    ", we have found that the interferometer needs about three times fewer pixels than the single dish to achieve the same or even better measurement of the band powers .",
    "the main reason is that it has the most sensitivity at the peak of the power spectrum .",
    "apart from a serious leakage between @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes at low @xmath59 region due to poor determination of the phase , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be separated within the resolution limit with a mixing of less than 10 percents .",
    "this small mixing arises because the sidelobes of the effective beam in mosaicking lead to aliased power , or equivalently increase the uncertainty of sampling the phase .",
    "as is known , this effect can be alleviated by making a dense mosaicked map  @xcite . with regard to a similar problem in the field of weak gravitational lensing that one wants to separate the @xmath0-mode cosmic shear from other @xmath1-mode signals due to intrinsic galaxy alignment or systematic errors as discussed in @xcite and references therein",
    ", we may consider a phase modulated annulus filter analogous to an interferometric beam to make a pixelized map from lensing data .",
    "the work along this line is under progress .",
