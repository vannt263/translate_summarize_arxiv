    "the discovery of neutrino mixing has changed our picture of the universe and of the nature of matter and energy in important ways .",
    "it requires that the standard model be extended to include nonzero neutrino mass and points the way to a deeper stratum of the underlying theory .",
    "it motivates the further study of the neutrino mixing ( mnsp ) matrix , with a natural benchmark of measuring its elements at least as well as those of the quark ( ckm ) mixing matrix .",
    "the only way to do this , the neutrino factory ( nf ) , exploits the decay of muons  a process subject to no hadronic uncertainty  in long straight sections of a high - energy storage ring , to create well understood beams of muon and electron ( anti)neutrinos that can be aimed at remote detectors  @xcite .",
    "the most poorly known elements of the mnsp matrix are @xmath0 and the _ cp _ asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "a further unknown is the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , which of the three known neutrino species is the heaviest .",
    "last year @xmath0 was measured for the first time  @xcite , and it now appears likely that the mass hierarchy will be determined within the next ten years by global fits to data from near - term experiments  @xcite .",
    "the _ sine qua non _ of long - baseline neutrino experimentation  the precise measurement of @xmath1will however remain open .",
    "the experimental determination that @xmath0 is nonzero to more than five standard deviations  @xcite has been crucial to this effort , since the observability of @xmath1 depends on all three mnsp angles being nonzero .    a series of studies  @xcite have assessed the feasibility of long - baseline neutrino factories and indicated their likely reach and cost range .",
    "a project to construct such a facility now appears practical  @xcite , once a limited set of issues have been addressed by an r&d program now in progress  @xcite . of these ,",
    "the most challenging are the required high beam power on the pion - production target and the cooling of the muon beam in order to increase the stored intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig : nf ] shows block diagrams of the two approaches currently under investigation . the ids - nf  @xcite  green field \" study finds an optimal baseline of @xmath22,000 km , matched to a 10gev muon energy and a magnetized - iron detector .",
    "the muon accelerator program ( map )  @xcite approach starts with the 1,300 km fermilab  homestake baseline , for which the optimal muon energy is 5gev and the required muon - detection momentum threshold correspondingly lower , with the use of a lar detector ( preferably in a magnetic field so as to distinguish detected @xmath3 from @xmath4 ) being beneficial .",
    "the two approaches have been shown to have comparable physics reach  @xcite .",
    "they are seen to have much in common , with differences stemming from the site - specific nature of the map design . in particular , they employ the same targetry and cooling approaches .",
    "the neutrino factory goal of @xmath5 neutrinos per year aimed at a remote detector requires use of a multi - megawatt proton beam for pion production .",
    "designs exist for beams of the requisite intensity at cern , fermilab , and ral  @xcite .",
    "conventional solid targets are however expected to display inconveniently short lifetimes under such intense proton bombardment  @xcite , motivating the development of a recirculating liquid jet target . at the relatively low proton energies under consideration ( 38gev ) , high-@xmath6 target materials such as hg or pb ",
    "bi eutectic are attractive in order to roughly equalize the @xmath7 and @xmath8 yields and enable the use of a shorter target , although ga also has advantages  @xcite .",
    "the principle of a liquid - hg jet was demonstrated in the merit experiment at cern in 2007 , which targeted intense proton pulses from the ps on a mercury jet within a 15 t solenoid at approximately one pulse per hour .",
    "instantaneous pulse intensities consistent with 8mw beam power at a 70hz pulse repetition rate were shown to be feasible  @xcite .    current development work  @xcite centers on the magnet and shielding arrangement needed in order to capture pions produced in the target , and their decay muons , with high efficiency , while protecting the superconducting coils from beam - induced radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : tgt ] shows a recent design .",
    "it incorporates a 1520 t hybrid solenoid magnet , comprising a superconducting outsert and copper insert , surrounding the target . proceeding downstream",
    ", the mercury collection pool also serves as the beam dump , and the solenoid field tapers gradually to 1.52 t , the exact field values and profile being the subject of ongoing optimization studies .",
    "copious amounts of shielding are deployed , necessarily increasing the solenoid bore and stored energy .",
    "the initial capture solenoid has a @xmath23gj stored energy  very large by accelerator standards , but small compared , e.g. , to that of iter .",
    "alternative designs using high - temperature superconductor may have advantages and are being explored .",
    "given the multiple projects worldwide that are planned for multi - megawatt beams , engineering solutions are expected to be available by the time they are needed . a neutrino factory built in advance of such solutions is nevertheless worthwhile since useful sensitivity beyond that available at superbeams is achievable with intensity a factor @xmath2610 lower than that of the  ultimate \" ( e.g. , ids - nf ) facility  @xcite .",
    "this could be achieved ( for example ) by starting out at 1mw proton - beam power ( as discussed for superbeams ) and postponing muon cooling ( discussed next ) to a later upgrade .",
    "this is in fact the approach advocated by map  @xcite .",
    "muon cooling , while not essential for a neutrino factory , has been shown cost - effective as a means of increasing the rate of detected events , as compared to putting more beam on target or substantially increasing the size of the detector . only ionization cooling  @xcite is fast enough to cool muons before a large fraction of them have decayed .",
    "it uses energy loss in low-@xmath6 absorbers to reduce the divergence of the beam ; alternating - gradient focusing brings a concomitant reduction of the beam s cross - sectional area .",
    "the competing process is multiple coulomb scattering , thus the rate of normalized - emittance change per unit absorber length is given by  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the muon velocity , energy , and mass ; @xmath13 the lattice betatron function ( focal length ) at the absorber location ; and @xmath14 the radiation length of the absorber material .",
    "low-@xmath6 absorber media are thus preferred , with lih the medium of choice in recent nf studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : cool ] shows the cooling channel used in the ids - nf study  @xcite , which delivers a factor @xmath22.2 in stored - muon intensity .",
    "essentially , it is a linac with low-@xmath6 absorber material inserted . to be efficient , as much of the lattice as possible",
    "should contain absorber .",
    "however , the energy - loss rates available from low-@xmath6 absorbers ( @xmath15100mev / m ) substantially exceed  real - estate \" rf accelerating gradients ( @xmath1510mv / m ) , thus in practice the rf cavities dominate the length of the channel . to achieve low @xmath13 within the shortest possible distance , solenoids are preferred over the more conventional , quadrupole focusing .        while none of the ingredients of a muon cooling channel is new , their combination in the close confines of a lattice that is as short as possible is novel .",
    "it has therefore been deemed important to demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of building such a channel and operating it in a muon beam ; this also affords the opportunity to test in detail the physics models used in designing ionization - cooling channels .",
    "the result is the international muon ionization cooling experiment ( mice )  @xcite , under construction at the uk s rutherford appleton laboratory ( discussed elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite ) .",
    "ionization cooling s large needed rf - bucket area and race against muon decay place high - gradient rf cavities in strong solenoidal magnetic fields .",
    "r&d on such cavities has shown that strong solenoidal focusing exacerbates breakdown  @xcite , potentially limiting the rf gradient that can be achieved . cooling -",
    "channel r&d thus includes an effort to understand and mitigate the sources of such breakdown  @xcite .",
    "recent progress includes the demonstration that a high - pressure gaseous hydrogen fill can totally suppress magnetic - field - induced breakdown , and that the resulting cavity plasma loading ( due to ionization electrons ) can be managed by introduction of a sub - percent admixture of electronegative impurity gas  @xcite .",
    "hydrogen - pressurized cooling channels thus appear feasible , though they do present unique engineering challenges  @xcite .",
    "promising ideas to suppress background in vacuum cavities are also under investigation  @xcite .",
    "although they have novel elements , the following key sections of a neutrino factory are more straightforward than the cooling and targetry .",
    "as mentioned , multiple multi - mw proton sources have been discussed , and a number are in various stages of design , upgrading , or construction around the world  @xcite .",
    "the map plan is based on project x at fermilab , whose reference design  @xcite envisions a cw 1gev , 1mw h@xmath16 linac feeding , in turn , 13gev , 3mw and 38gev , 0.3mw pulsed linacs .",
    "accumulator and compressor rings are added ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] ) in order to provide a proton beam on target with the requisite duty factor .",
    "useful neutrino factory sensitivity is already achievable with 1mw at 3gev (  numax \" ) , which can later be upgraded ( to  numax+ \" ) by the addition of a 3mw target and muon - cooling channel  @xcite .",
    "a further upgrade scenario has been studied in which the beam current and bunch length in these linacs are increased in order to provide a 4mw beam power at 8gev , suitable for a muon collider .",
    "the ids - nf plan envisions either a multi - gev linac or a 180mev h@xmath16 linac feeding two rapid - cycling synchrotrons or ffags .      following the target and",
    "capture section of the neutrino factory , the muon beam must be prepared for cooling and acceleration .",
    "pions , and hence , their decay muons , are produced over a wide range of momentum . a drift section employing a solenoid focusing lattice",
    "allows a momentum ",
    "time correlation to develop , following which the muons are bunched and  phase rotated \" by accelerating the slower ones and decelerating the faster ones .",
    "this is accomplished in a ",
    "vernier \" rf scheme employing a range of frequencies from ( in the ids - nf version ) 320 to 202mhz .",
    "simulations have shown that large numbers of higher - energy protons produced in the target , which would cause losses in absorbers and windows , would be transported by such a lattice ; to avoid this , they are separated from the muons via a chicane and absorbed in shielding .      following the cooling section",
    "the muons are accelerated in a linac feeding one or two rlas ( depending on the desired final energy ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rla ] shows the 5gev map design .",
    "a previous 25gev design incorporated an ffag stage as well , but given the measured value of @xmath0 , so high an energy is no longer essential .",
    "the decay ring must accommodate large numbers of decaying muons and thus must be designed to handle energy deposition from decay electrons .",
    "this requires the incorporation of a tungsten liner .",
    "a 10gev design has been devised for ids - nf and can be scaled to 5gev .",
    "an  entry level \" neutrino factory ( numax ) , without cooling and with a 1mw target , has a physics reach exceeding that of a mw - scale superbeam . given its inherent upgradability ( to numax+ ) , it is arguably the preferable option . with only a few open r&d issues remaining , and a clear path to their resolution",
    ", neutrino factory design is reaching the point where the start of a construction project could be envisaged this decade .",
