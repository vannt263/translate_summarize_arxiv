    "the interactions between the ejected nucleon and the spectator pair were neglected .",
    "et al_.  @xcite also studied the two  fragment electro - disintegration of @xmath4he and @xmath4h , but with the inclusion of the fsi .",
    "these calculations were based on a method introduced by barbour and phillips @xcite , and extended by gibson and lehman @xcite , for the photo - disintegration of @xmath4he .",

    "@xcite , a spin - dependent , @xmath5-wave separable potential of yamaguchi form was used in these calculations .",
    "in contrast , van meijgaard and tjon @xcite employed the semi - realistic malfliet - tjon ( mt  i - iii ) potential @xcite represented in separable form via the unitary pole expansion ( upe ) .",
    "realistic interactions have also been used to determine the electro - disintegration cross sections .",
    "schiavilla @xcite , for example , employed the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method using the urbana @xcite and argonne @xcite nucleon  nucleon ( nn ) interactions for determining the bound state wave functions in the electro - disintegration of @xmath4he .",
    "his method involved constructing the final scattering states to be orthogonal to the initial bound state . in a completely different method ,",
    "laget @xcite employed a diagrammatic expansion of the scattering amplitude , which can be used to account for the most important multi - particle effects in the nuclear medium such as fsi and meson exchange currents ( mec ) . in a more rigorous approach ishikawa _",
    "et al_.   @xcite calculated the electron  induced two - fragment disintegration of @xmath4he by using a 34-channel treatment based on faddeev - type equations in momentum space . in their work",
    "they employed realistic two  nucleon interactions , namely the paris @xcite and bonn - b @xcite potentials .",
    "later on , golak _ at al . _",
    "@xcite extended the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by including higher angular momentum components of the nn force ( up to @xmath6 ) .",
    "in contrast to the three ",
    "nucleon electro - disintegration , calculations for the four - nucleon system are computationally much more demanding and to date no calculations have been performed to reliably include scattering states in a rigorous way .",
    "one therefore resorts to using the approximation @xmath7 which is often employed in nuclear physics , and has previously been used in the photo - disintegration @xcite and electro - disintegration @xcite of @xmath8he . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the full scattering state associated with the channel state @xmath10 in which the ejected proton is moving with momentum @xmath11 relative to the residual nucleus represented by the bound state @xmath12 .",
    "in such a model approach extreme care must be taken to ensure that the approximate scattering states in ( [ eq : scatt ] ) are orthogonal to the initial bound state @xmath13 , @xmath14 non - fulfillment of this condition means that the effective scattering state , although asymptotically correct , can be different from the `` true '' wave function in the interior .",
    "this in turn means that the off shell characteristics of the effective interaction employed can be completely wrong .",
    "this point is crucial since in photo- and electro - processes we are concerned with overlap integrals that include also the interior part of the wave  function .",
    "that condition is often simply ignored or some kind of an orthogonalization method is employed to ensure that it is fulfilled ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the approximation ( [ eq : scatt ] ) together with the condition ( [ eq : overlap ] ) has been used by schiavilla @xcite within the vmc method ( in a fashion similar to the one employed in @xmath4he electro - disintegration ) using the argonne two  nucleon and urbana - vii three - nucleon @xcite interaction models .",
    "the optical potential of van oers _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was employed in this approach to describe the 3 + 1 interaction .",
    "laget @xcite included the fsi and the meson exchange currents ( mec ) using a diagrammatic expansion similar to the three  nucleon case .",
    "et al._@xcite included the electromagnetic field in the strongly interacting system in a relativistic and gauge invariant way , with the fsi being incorporated via the pole piece of the p@xmath4h@xmath15 p@xmath4h scattering t - matrix @xcite . in a more recent work @xcite the schiavilla , the laget , and the nagorny methods were employed to study newly obtained data by van leeuwe @xcite .",
    "the results thus obtained were interpreted as an indication that the dip could be due to fsi effects and contributions from two  body currents .",
    "the main findings in the aforementioned investigations of three and four  nucleon disintegration processes were that ( a ) in certain kinematical regions there is an extreme sensitivity to the nuclear forces ; ( b ) there are important differences between the results obtained when using different reaction models , and ( c ) in the four  nucleon case all model calculations within the plane  wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) exhibit a dip in the five - fold differential cross ",
    "section around a missing momentum of @xmath2450mev which , being absent from the experimental data , seems to be an artifact of the models .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the above sensitivities of the cross section to the input nucleon  nucleus interaction in the exclusive electro - disintegration process @xmath16 where the scattered electron and the ejected nucleon are assumed to be measured in coincidence .    in our model the interaction between the outgoing proton and the residual nucleus",
    "is determined by using the nucleon - nucleus scattering data to generate an effective potential via the marchenko inverse procedure @xcite .",
    "the potential obtained would be unique , provided the phase shifts were known at all energies . since theoretically the phase shifts can be calculated reliably only below the three  body break up threshold while experimentally they are available from a limited number of phase shift analyses , extrapolations to higher energies are required .",
    "the most obvious choice appears to be the one leading to states which fulfill the orthogonality condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) .",
    "thus the dependence of the interaction on the extrapolated phase shifts and the resulting effect on the cross section is studied .",
    "such an approach could be useful in reactions involving few cluster systems where the effective interaction needed to construct the scattering wave function , contains a lot of inherent ambiguities mainly stemming from the limited scattering data .",

    "we employ the model outlined in the introduction in which the fsi is taken into account via an optical potential treatment of the relative motion of the outgoing clusters . in this particularly simplifying modification the plane wave @xmath54 is replaced by scattering states @xmath55 generated by a @xmath56h potential obtained using the marchenko inverse scattering procedure @xcite .",

    "the effects of the all important higher partial waves are approximately included via the use of the hypercentral potential ( for more details of the idea see refs .",
    "reliable experimental phase shifts required in the construction of the effective potential for the 3 + 1 fragmentation of @xmath8he are not available . furthermore , the energy region in which they are available has little or no overlap with the region needed for our calculations . on the theoretical front , phase shifts beyond the three ",
    "body break up have not yet been obtained .",
    "therefore , in implementing our model we employed phase shifts obtained from the optical potential used by schiavilla @xcite . since the phase shifts produced by this potential become negative for energies greater than 200mev , we had to extrapolate them to higher energies . in fig .",

    "the corresponding real parts of the marchenko potentials that describe the @xmath66h interaction are plotted in fig .",
    "[ vpot4r ] .",
    "the local potentials produced by the marchenko procedure are complex and unique for each set of data .",
    "they are phase equivalent up to approximately 300mev , producing phase shifts with slightly different high energy behavior .",
    "the extrapolation ext . 2 , produced an overlap integral that was , for all practical purposes , zero .",
    "the various kinematics used are given in table [ kin4 ] . in fig .",
    "[ kinr ] we have plotted our cross section results for the kinematics r together with the experimental data of ref .",
    "these results are very close to those obtained by laget @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the cross section is only weakly dependent on the nucleon ",
    "nucleus interaction , all extrapolations yielding virtually identical results .",
    "the effect of the high  energy behavior of the phase shifts on the cross section and the importance of the orthogonality condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) , is more clearly demonstrated in the plots of the cross sections for the kinematics ( a , b , c , d ) and kinematics s , shown in figs .",
    "[ kinabcd ] to [ kins ] .",
    "the pwia prediction for kinematics ( a , b , c , d ) shows a minimum , in fact a zero , in agreement with the calculations of laget and schiavilla . at missing momenta below 300mev/@xmath3 ,",
    "all calculations show good agreement with the data , but in the region of the dip the calculations underestimate the data considerably . beyond missing momenta of @xmath2",
    "550mev/@xmath3 the agreement of the calculations with the data is again fair .",
    "the best result is the one obtained for ext .",
    "2 which fulfills the orthogonality condition ( [ eq : overlap ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ koosabc_comp ] , we compare the cross section produced using this extrapolation with the results of laget @xcite ; it is seen that the agreement is good .",
    "the pwia cross section calculated for kinematics s , shown in fig .",
    "[ kins ] , also exhibits a dip at @xmath2450mev/@xmath3 . including the fsi causes a partial filling of this dip .",
    "the position of the minimum and the value of the cross section in this region once again depends strongly on the input nucleon  nucleus and the nn potentials .",
    "the results described above clearly indicate a sensitivity of the cross section in certain kinematical regions to the input nucleon  nucleus interaction and to the input nn potential . in our model ,",
    "the various nucleon - nucleus ( 3 + 1 ) interactions employed for this investigation were phase equivalent up to approximately 300mev .",
    "they all reproduced the correct binding energy for the four  nucleon bound state .",
    "however , beyond 300mev , the potentials produced phase shifts that differed slightly .",
    "the corresponding nucleon ",
    "nucleus potentials provided scattering states that were not always orthogonal to the initial bound state .",
    "this in turn is translated into large differences in the cross sections in certain kinematical regions .",
    "this result was not surprising , as already in 1970 , fiedeldey @xcite investigated the dependence of the triton binding energy on the high - energy part of the phase shift .",
    "he concluded that arbitrary variations of the nn phase shift at high energies ( @xmath67mev ) can produce large differences in the triton binding energy .",
    "this sensitivity is also manifested in the electro - disintegration cross sections which implies that we need a much clearer idea of what constitutes a physically acceptable extension of the phase shift to higher energies .",
    "this sounds a warning that in model calculations care must be taken when using effective interactions , the most important constraint being the condition that the initial bound state and the final scattering state be orthogonal .",
    "the dip around 450mev/@xmath3 , which is present in all model calculations , is something of a surprise . at missing momenta less than 300mev/@xmath3",
    "all calculations show a good agreement with the experimental data , _",
    "i.e. _ , the pwia performs reasonably well in a region where the fsi could be expected to be more important . at missing momenta beyond the dip area , where the mec become important ,",
    "the agreement with the data is fair .",
    "thus the zero in the pwia cross - section is not necessarily a manifestation of strong fsi effects or mec .",
    "it can simply be attributed to the vanishing born term which contains only genuine @xmath68 components .",
    "the born term should , however , be treated in a more rigorous way using the ags formalism which allows for the effects coming from the 2 + 2 channel .",
    "the inclusion of this channel should result in an improvement of the the bound state wave functions and of the born term .",
    "this in turn is expected to remove the apparent zero in the pwia cross section .",
    "investigations in this regard are currently under way .",
