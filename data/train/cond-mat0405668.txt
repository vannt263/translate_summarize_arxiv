    ", the influence of the structured substrates on the properties of liquid crystals has been studied and it has been demonstrated that to a certain extent such nontrivial geometries may optimize the performance of electro - optical liquid - crystalline devices .",
    "for instance , a four - domain twisted nematic liquid crystal display provides a wide viewing angle with no gray scale inversion@xcite and using multistable nematic liquid - crystal devices with micropatterned substrate alignments reduces the energy consumption  @xcite .",
    "the influence of the anchoring on the liquid crystal order parameter translates into an effective interaction between the confining interfaces which may be provided either by true solid substrates or by an adjacent vapor phase where the former case can support permanent lateral structures . here",
    "we consider liquid crystals deep in their nematic phase where the orientational order is described by a director field with long - ranged correlations . in case of any mismatch between the prescribed alignment of the bulk and the substrates",
    ", the director structure may not be uniform .",
    "in such a case , the free energy of the system typically exhibits several , metastable , minima which upon a change in the parameters of the system  such as the film thickness , external , or internal forces  may turn into the global minimum resulting in a structural phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this makes the stability of the equilibrium configuration geometry dependent . in this context",
    "one should keep in mind that perturbative approaches may miss the occurrence of first - order structural phase transition .",
    "we shall consider the case of frustrated systems in which , however , the director structure remains uniform up to a critical thickness @xmath1 .",
    "within such a regime the liquid - crystalline mediated effective interaction between the confining interfaces due to the thermal fluctuations of the director adds to background contributions due to structural forces arising from presmectic layering@xcite and enhanced ordering near the substrates@xcite and due to dispersion forces@xcite which exhibit only a weak temperature dependence .    using the continuum frank free energy , we study the fluctuation - induced interaction  the so - called liquid - crystalline casimir effect  between two parallel interfaces where",
    "one is periodically patterned and the other one is homogeneous .",
    "we consider a periodicity in the local anchoring energy and model the liquid crystal - substrate interaction by the rapini - papoular surface free energy .",
    "we investigate the modification of the fluctuation - induced force compared with its behavior for substrates with uniform anchoring conditions  @xcite as a function of the pattern periodicity @xmath2 and the characteristic length of the pattern @xmath3 ( see fig.[geo55.eps ] ) .",

    "one consists of a substrate with a pattern characterized by homeotropic anchoring of alternating strengths facing a second substrate at a distance @xmath0 which is characterized by a uniformly strong homeotropic anchoring . for this system",
    "the mean director is constant at any separation . by changing the boundary condition via the change of the patterning ratio @xmath4 , the character of the force changes .",
    "depending on whether the boundaries are effectively similar - nonsimilar or similar - similar the force is repulsive or attractive , respectively . for certain values of @xmath4 and of the reduced distance @xmath5 , the liquid - crystalline casimir force vanishes . in the second system",
    "the pattern consists of alternating stripes of homeotropic and degenerate planar anchoring while the upper substrate still exhibits strong homeotropic anchoring . in this case",
    "there is the possibility of texture formation  @xcite .",
    "however , for separations smaller than a critical one the director structure is indeed uniform  @xcite .",
    "for those ranges of the model parameters for which the director is constant ( see , c.f . , subsec.[iii ] ) , we find a nonmonotonic behavior for the fluctuation - induced force .",
    "there are several techniques that can be used to create periodic anchoring conditions such as photo - alignment  @xcite , the selectively thiol - functionalized photo - orientation  @xcite , and atomic force lithography  @xcite . in the latter case patterning at the nano - meter scale",
    "is reached which allows one to investigate more efficiently the influence of the patterned substrate on the liquid crystal .",

    "we consider a pattern consisting of alternating stripes of either homeotropic or degenerate planar anchoring , i.e. , positive values for @xmath19 and negative values for @xmath20 , so that the liquid crystal is subject to competing preferred orientations at the bottom substrate while the upper substrate still exhibits strong homeotropic anchoring . in this case fluctuations",
    "are suppressed at the stripes of homeotropic anchoring and enhanced at the stripes of planar anchoring [ eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ] . for those ranges of the model parameters for which the frustrating effect of the interlaced planar anchoring does not modify the mean orientation of the director ,",
    "the uniform configuration of the director is thermodynamically stable and the system can be described as in the previous subsection .",
    "however , if the planar anchoring becomes dominant , the uniform director configuration is destabilized . for this case",

    "this illustrates that as expected @xmath155 approaches the proximity force solution ( dashed curve ) for @xmath206 and the effective anchoring solution ( solid curve ) for @xmath216 . ]",
    "we consider again first the case @xmath157 which allows us to describe the force in terms of an effective anchoring energy and an effective extrapolation length . within the same approximation as in the preceding subsection , i.e. , truncating the matrix @xmath125 at order @xmath217 , the force [ eq.([eqf ] ) ]",
    "is given by @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 is the rescaled momentum  @xcite .",
    "the form of this force is that of the force for the hybrid cell  @xcite with the bottom substrate described by an effective planar anchoring @xmath221 .",
    "thus in this limit the patterning enters only via this expression for @xmath222 .",
    "for @xmath223 the long - ranged repulsion between the boundaries , characterized by strong and effectively weak anchoring , is enhanced : @xmath224 upon approaching the critical separation @xmath225 the force increases and , within the gaussian approximation , diverges logarithmically at @xmath1 : @xmath226\\;.\\ ] ] this behavior follows from the fact that for @xmath227 the denominator of the integrand in eq.([hybrid1 ] ) vanishes as @xmath228 for @xmath229 .",
    "thus the pretransitional behavior @xmath230 of the force is related to the sigularity of the soft mode @xmath231 .",
    "the logarithmic divergence is a characteristic feature of the perturbative method [ eq.([eq1p ] ) ] if applied to a system subject to structural phase transitions  @xcite . here",
    "the planar anchoring destabilizes the uniform structure governed by the strong homeotropic anchoring at the upper boundary . upon increasing the separation @xmath0 the influence of the upper boundary decreases and the destabilizing effect of the substrate characterized by the planar anchoring increases so that upon approaching @xmath232 the uniform structure becomes unstable  @xcite . beyond the critical separation ,",
    "the director structure is no longer uniform and the gaussian hamiltonian given by eq.([eq1 ] ) does no longer describe the system . for @xmath233",
    "one must consider the fluctuations around a nonuniform configuration @xmath234 .",
    "it is possible and even likely that the actual critical film thickness for the structural phase transition is not given by @xmath225 as obtained in the present perturbative approach .    in the regime of the uniform director configuration , for separations comparable to the periodicity",
    "we have calculated the force numerically .",
    "as for eq.([eqa ] ) , in the limit @xmath188 the force is given by the geometrically weighted average of the local force densities : @xmath235 in fig .",
    "[ pata0.ps ] the behavior of the fluctuation - induced force is shown for the three different regimes .",
    "based on the frank [ eq.([eq0 ] ) ] and rapini - papoular [ eq.([eq6 ] ) ] expression for the bulk and surface free energy , respectively , we have studied by field theoretical techniques the contribution of gaussian fluctuations of the orientational order to the effective force acting on the planar and parallel boundaries of a nematic film of thickness @xmath0 . the upper boundary exhibits strong and homogeneous homeotropic anchoring whereas the bottom boundary is characterized by a one - dimensional , steplike periodic modulation with period @xmath2 of either the strength or the orientation of the anchoring which is homeotropic or planar ( see fig .",
    "[ geo55.eps ] ) .",
    "the system parameters are chosen such that the thermal average of the nematic order configuration is spatially homogeneous throughout the film .",
    "our main results are the following :    \\(1 ) for @xmath165 , the fluctuation - induced force is proportional to @xmath183 times a scaling function which attains the same form as in the case that the patterned bottom substrate exhibits a homogeneous anchoring energy per area @xmath236 with the different anchoring energies per area @xmath237 weighted according to their lateral geometric contribution ( eqs.([eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq7e ] ) as well as ( [ hybrid1 ] ) and ( [ hybrid1e ] ) ) . if a change of the pattern of the anchoring strength causes the corresponding effective boundary condition on the patterned substrate to change from homeotropic weak to homeotropic strong anchoring , the force exhibits a crossover from repulsion to attraction ( see figs .",
    "[ geo5.eps],[geoa.eps ] , and [ geo6.eps ] ) . for a pattern of competing anchoring energies in the case that the stripes with planar anchoring are dominant relative to the stripes of homeotropic anchoring ,",
    "the fluctuation - induced force is repulsive and nonmonotonic .",
    "\\(2 ) for @xmath190 , the proximity approximation is valid , i.e. , the force is given by the geometrically weighted average of the local force densities obtained from the homogeneous substrates ( eqs.([eqa ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) ) .",
    "\\(3 ) for intermediate separations , we have examined the behavior of the force numerically . for a pattern of homeotropic anchoring with alternating strengths , the rescaled relative decrease of the fluctuation - induced force as a function of the reduced separation compared to the long - ranged force",
    "is summarized in figs.[q ] and [ q1 ] for several values of the reduced periodicity .",
    "we note that by increasing the reduced periodicity the system approaches the limit of the proximity force approximation given by eq.([eqa ] ) ( solid line in fig.[q ] ) , while by decreasing the reduced periodicity the system approaches the limit of the effective anchoring approximation given by eq.([eq7 ] ) ( solid line in fig.[q1 ] ) .",
    "\\(4 ) for a pattern of competing anchoring energies , the behavior of the force is summarized in fig.[pata0.ps ] .",
    "also in this case the full numerical solution interpolates between the asymptotic formulae given for small @xmath0 [ eq.([eqp ] ) ] and large @xmath0 [ eq.([hybrid1 ] ) ] .",
    "besides the force due to fluctuations of the director in a nematic film , there are additional forces acting between interfaces of the film such as the well - known van der waals dispersion force@xcite so that the total force is the sum of the fluctuation - induced and the dispersion forces . in the case that the mean director is inhomogeneous so - called structural forces appear in addition which are not present in the homogeneous case considered here . for a film geometry of thickness @xmath0 and area @xmath238 ,",
    "the dispersion force decays as @xmath239 where @xmath173 is the so - called hamaker constant . as implied by eqs.([eq7 ] ) and ( [ hybrid1 ] ) , the magnitude of the fluctuation - induced force scales as @xmath240 .",
    "thus , apart from a numerical prefactor of order one , the overall ratio between the dispersion force and the fluctation - induced force is given by @xmath241 . since liquid crystals and glass substrates have typically comparable indices of refraction , the hamaker constant is of the order @xmath242@xcite which is the same order of magnitude as @xmath243 at room temperature .",
    "therefore typically the dispersion and fluctuation induced force in liquid crystals are of the same order of magnitude and thus comparable .",
    "we mention that for a more adequate estimate of the hamaker constant the anisotropy of the liquid crystal has to be taken into account@xcite . for larger thicknesses",
    "the dispersion force decays faster ( @xmath244 ) due to retardation@xcite , so that for sufficiently thick films the fluctuation - induced force dominates .",
    "finally we note that while the direct measurement of the fluctuation - induced force in liquid crystals has not yet been accomplished , these forces affect in a characteristic way the pattern formation of thin liquid - crystalline dewetting films@xcite .",
