    "the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) field theory in @xmath3 dimensions , with the higgs field in the adjoint representation possess magnetic monopole configurations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these monopole solution belongs to the category of solutions which are invariant under a u(1 ) subgroup of the local su(2 ) gauge group .",
    "the t hooft - polyakov monopole solution with non - zero higgs mass and self - interaction belongs to such category and it is the first finite energy monopole solution .",
    "this numerical monopole solution of unit magnetic charge is spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "however , finite energy monopole configurations with magnetic charges greater than unity @xcite can not possess spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "exact monopole solutions exist only in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite-@xcite . outside this limit and when the higgs field potential is non - vanishing , only numerical solutions are known .",
    "other exact solutions found are the a - m - a ( antimonopole - monopole - antimonopole ) and vortex ring solutions and various other mirror symmetric monopole configurations @xcite .",
    "numerical bps monopole solutions with no rotational symmetry have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "other numerical finite energy monopole solutions include the map ( monopole - antimonopole - pair ) , mac ( monopole - antimonopole - chain ) , and vortex ring solutions @xcite .",
    "however , most of these monopole solutions reported so far are of integer topological monopole charges .",
    "hence it is our purpose in this paper to discuss the existence of finite energy one - half monopole magnetic charge solutions .",
    "these one - half monopole solutions are numerical solutions that are solved by first obtaining the exact one - half monopole solutions at large distances and then fixing the boundary conditions at small distances and along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "we analyse four types of one - half monopole solutions which we label as type @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "our analysis shows that the type @xmath8 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) solutions are exactly @xmath9 rotation of the @xmath1-axis about the origin , @xmath10 , of the type @xmath11 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) solutions ( respectively ) .",
    "however for a particular value of higgs self - coupling constant , @xmath2 , the type 1 ( @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) and type 2 ( @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) solutions possess different total energies and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "comparisons of the gauge invariant form of the gauge field potentials and higgs fields are also made between the four one - half monopole solutions to confirm our conclusion that the type 1 and type 2 solutions are different one - half monopoles .",
    "the gauge potentials of the type @xmath11 ( type @xmath8 ) solutions are singular along the negative ( positive ) @xmath1-axis .",
    "the t hooft magnetic fields of these solutions at spatial infinity correspond to the magnetic field of a positive one - half monopole located at the origin , @xmath10 , and a semi - infinite dirac string located on one - half of the @xmath1-axis which carries a magnetic flux of @xmath0 going into the center of the sphere at infinity .",
    "hence the net magnetic charge of the configuration is zero .",
    "the location of the dirac string is always on the opposite side of the @xmath1-axis of its energy density concentration .",
    "when @xmath12 , the dimensionless total energy of the type 1 one - half monopole solutions is 0.509 and the that of the type 2 solutions is 0.525 .",
    "hence the total energies of these one - half monopole solutions seem to be higher than the dimensionless total energy of the bps solution which is exactly @xmath13 .",
    "the total energies of these one - half monopole solutions are calculated for various strength of the higgs field self - coupling constant and they are found to increase with @xmath2 .",
    "recently we have constructed one - half monopole configurations which are axially symmetric and possess a dirac string along one - half of the @xmath1-axis @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields are the usual magnetic field of a one - half monopole charge that is spherically symmetric and radial in direction .",

    "since this definition gives a discrete magnetic charge at a particular point , there is no magnetic charge distribution over space .",
    "another proposal which is less singular was given by bogomolnyi @xcite and faddeev @xcite , @xmath77 with this definition of the electromagnetic field ( [ eq.31 ] ) , there will be a magnetic charge density distribution contributed by the non - abelian components of the gauge field in the finite @xmath72 region",
    ". a 3d surface plot of the magnetic charge density distribution will be useful in determining the sign of the magnetic charge of the solutions . in the higgs vacuum at spatial infinity ,",
    "both definitions of the electromagnetic field ( [ eq.5 ] ) and ( [ eq.31 ] ) become similar .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ eq.19 ] ) , when applied on to the solution , @xmath78 will rotate the isospin direction , @xmath79 , into the magnetic anstaz ( [ eq.16 ] ) and the transformed gauge potentials and higgs field then take the form , @xmath80\\right\\}\\hat{n}^{a}_\\theta\\hat{\\phi}_i\\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{n}{r\\sin\\theta}\\left\\{\\cos\\theta - \\cos(f(r,\\theta)+\\theta)[1+ra(r,\\theta)\\sin\\theta]\\right\\}\\hat{n}^{a}_r\\hat{\\phi}_i , \\nonumber\\\\ ga^{\\prime a}_0 & = & 0 ,   \\nonumber\\\\ g\\phi^{\\prime a } & = & \\xi \\{\\cos(f(r,\\theta)+\\theta)~\\hat{n}^a_r - \\sin(f(r,\\theta)+\\theta)\\hat{n}^a_\\theta\\}. \\label{eq.33}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we also note that the angle @xmath81 . hence @xmath82 and the t hooft gauge potential and net magnetic field of the monopole configuration are given by @xmath83 respectively .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath99 of the above four solutions are given by @xmath100 when the semi - infinite dirac string along one - half of the @xmath1-axis is ignored . thus the four solutions possess common magnetic field of a one - half monopole located at the origin , @xmath10 , that are spherically symmetric , radial in direction and pointing in the higgs field direction in isospin space .",
    "similar to the gauge potentials , the higgs magnetic fields of the type @xmath11 solutions are singular along the negative @xmath1-axis , whereas the higgs magnetic fields of the type @xmath8 solutions are singular along the positive @xmath1-axis and they are given by @xmath101    the net t hooft s magnetic fields for the type @xmath11 and type @xmath8 solutions are however given by @xmath102 when the dirac string in the gauge potentials , @xmath66 , is taken into consideration @xcite .",
