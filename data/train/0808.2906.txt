    "quantum coherent dynamics at the initial stages of photosynthesis in complex biomolecular structures seems to promote the efficiency of energy transfer from the light - harvesting antenna complexes to the chemical reaction centers @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has recently been boosted by experiments revealing long - lived quantum coherent excitonic dynamics in the energy transfer among bacteriochlorophyll complexes over a surprisingly long time of around 600 fs measured at @xmath0 k @xcite .",
    "in addition , electronic coherences between excited states in purple photosynthetic bacteria have been monitored in a two - color photon echo experiment @xcite .",
    "both works lead to the conclusion that the collective long - range electrostatic response of the biomolecular protein environment to the electronic excitations should be responsible for the long - lived quantum coherence .",
    "furthermore , the obtained time scales @xcite for the short - time dynamics of the nuclear modes coupled to the excitonic states of two chromophores are almost identical .",
    "this points to the special and constructive role of the quantum environment for the photoexcitations .",
    "the often assumed coupling of the chromophores to fast and independent quantum baths does not hold in this case .",
    "in fact , the two chromophores are embedded in the _ same _ protein - solvent environment .",
    "these results corroborate experimental studies @xcite which show that energy transport sensitively depends on the spatial properties of the delocalized excited - state wave functions of the _ whole _ pigment - protein complex .",
    "in addition , there are reports of coherently controlled wave packet quantum dynamics artificially generated by laser pulses in the light - harvesting antenna of the bacteria _ rhodopseudomonas acidophila _ @xcite .",
    "an appropriate theoretical description of the biomolecular quantum dynamics has to account for the environmental time scales typically being of the same order of magnitude as the excitonic time scales @xcite .",
    "this fact renders the dynamics highly non - markovian and rather elaborate techniques are required to address the entire cross - over from fast to slowly responding baths .    here ,",
    "we perform a deterministic evaluation of real - time path integrals @xcite where all non - markovian effects are exactly included .",
    "we provide numerically exact results for the quantum coherent dynamics of photoexcitations in coupled chromophores , where the time evolution of the protein - solvent bath happens on time scales comparable to the exciton dynamics .",
    "we show that the non - markovian effects help to sustain quantum coherence over rather long times .",
    "furthermore , quantum entanglement of two chromophore pairs is shown to be more stable under the influence of a non - markovian bath . even at high temperatures ,",
    "a slow bath can generate considerable entanglement , a feature absent in the markovian case .",
    "we mention that recently , quantum entanglement of two optical two - level systems coupled to a common localized environmental mode has been studied beyond the markov approximation at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "a single chromophore ( index @xmath1 ) is modeled as a quantum two level system described by pauli matrices @xmath2 with energy gap @xmath3 between ground - state @xmath4 and excited state @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "the frster coupling between two chromophores is given by @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "observing that the fluorescence lifetime of the chromophores is much larger than all other time scales , we may neglect the radiative decay @xcite .",
    "then , the system s total number of excitations is a constant of motion , and the two - chromophore system can be reduced to a single spin - boson model of one chromophore pair ( with the pauli matrices @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 describe bosonic bath operators with couplings @xmath11 .",

    "one finds for the order of magnitude of @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "this sets the time - scale for the bath dynamics and is related to the reorganization energy @xmath18 . if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the bath evolves fast compared to the system and loses its memory quickly , rendering a markovian approximation and the standard bloch - redfield description @xcite suitable .",
    "this situation is ubiquitous in many physical systems , e.g. , ion traps , quantum dots , and superconducting devices @xcite .",
    "it is qualitatively different for the excitons in the biomolecular environment . here",
    ", @xmath21 is typically of the order of @xmath22 mev , while the frster coupling constants can range from @xmath23 mev@xmath24 mev @xcite .",
