    "the concept of gravity as an emergent phenomenon @xcite continues to be one of the attracting and stimulating ideas in theoretical physics @xcite , @xcite . according to this point of view",
    ", the space - time metric is an effective low - energy variable and metric changes are collective excitations of underlying degrees of freedom of some unknown fundamental theory .",
    "the idea gets an inspiration from the condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , at very small scales the space - time may have a discrete lattice structure and gravitons , like phonons , may be collective excitations of the lattice .",
    "gravity analogs in condensed matter physics may be very useful to develop an intuition about the physics at planckian energies and to model phenomena predicted in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the experience with condensed matter models tells us that macroscopical phenomena can be described without knowledge of the microscopical structure . under certain conditions one can quantize the effective low - energy variables and get reliable results which are equivalent to computations in terms of genuine microscopical degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this feature is also present in effective field theories , like the theory of pions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    one of characteristics of a many - body system is a quantum entanglement which measures a degree of the correlation between different parts of the system . quantum entanglement in condensed matter received a considerable attention in last few years .",
    "its study helps to understand better collective effects in strongly correlated systems , see @xcite for a review .",
    "another application of the entanglement is a quantum information theory where it is used to store and process the information @xcite .",
    "the quantum entanglement is quantified by an entropy .",
    "the present paper considers the entanglement entropy in a fundamental ( quantum gravity ) theory by adopting the point of view that gravity is an emergent phenomenon @xcite .",
    "let us start with the problem formulated in @xcite : if the fundamental theory were known what would be the entropy of entanglement in a flat space - time between the degrees of freedom divided by a plane ? according to @xcite in the leading order approximation the entropy @xmath0 for a sufficiently large but finite piece @xmath1 of the plane can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the area of @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from ( [ i.1 ] ) that the main information about correlations of the degrees of freedom across the plane is encoded in the gravity coupling @xmath4 in the low - energy sector of the theory .",
    "the conjecture was motivated by the black hole physics where the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath5 is given by ( [ i.1 ] ) and @xmath3 is the area of the black hole horizon .",
    "one of possible interpretations @xcite@xcite relates @xmath5 to an entanglement of the degrees of freedom across the horizon .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find a definition of the entanglement entropy @xmath0 in the presence of the gravitational field and study its properties .",
    "the case considered in @xcite is a system divided by a plane . in a flat space the plane is a minimal surface .",
    "we present a number of arguments that the entanglement entropy in a quantum gravity is given by ( [ i.1 ] ) and in a static space - time the separating surface @xmath1 is a minimal least area hypersurface in a constant - time slice .",
    "finding a minimal surface for given boundary conditions is called the plateau problem .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is a dynamical variable which has a simple geometrical meaning is rather non - trivial from the physical point of view .",
    "it means that _ the entanglement entropy in a quantum gravity theory can be measured solely in terms of macroscopical ( low - energy ) parameters without the knowledge of a microscopical content of the theory_. in this regard @xmath0 , being a more general concept , is analogous to a thermodynamical entropy .",
    "the relation between the entanglement entropy and minimal surfaces is not unexpected . in a different context , ryu and takayanagi @xcite ,",
    "@xcite suggested a holographic formula for the entanglement entropy in conformal field theories ( cft ) which admit a dual description in terms of the anti - de sitter ( ads ) gravity one dimension higher .",
    "the holographic formula looks as ( [ i.1 ] ) where @xmath4 is a higher - dimensional gravity coupling .",
    "it yields the entropy of a cft in terms of the area of a minimal surface embedded in a higher - dimensional bulk space - time .",
    "the holographic formula can be tested in case of two - dimensional cft s and it reproduces correctly results of quantum computations .",
    "although our hypothesis and the suggestion of @xcite , @xcite may be related they are different statements .",
    "the holographic formula is a geometrical representation of the entanglement entropy for a certain class of quantum field models .",
    "thus , the entropy here is a model and cutoff dependent quantity .",
    "the paper organized as follows .",
    "the arguments in favour of ( [ i.1 ] ) are presented in section 2 .",
    "we remind a path integral approach for computation of the entanglement entropy in qft s and introduce a `` partition function '' @xmath6 in a form of a gibbons - hawking path integral with a special choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "the entropy @xmath0 can be computed from @xmath6 in a statistical - mechanical manner .",
    "a similar construction was used in @xcite to justify the holographic formula of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the geometry do not allow to fix the separating surface at the beginning .",
    "the surface is specified by boundary conditions .",
    "we show that the leading order approximation to @xmath6 is determined by the geometries where the separating surface is a minimal co - dimension 2 hypersurface with a least volume .",
    "the main suggestion about entanglement entropy in a quantum gravity theory is formulated in section 3 for static space - times .",
    "we first consider space - times where constant - time slices are cauchy hypersurfaces with simply connected boundaries .",
    "static space - times are singled out because the separating surface @xmath1 , which is an extremal co - dimension 2 hypersurface in the space - time , is a minimal co - dimension 1 hypersurface in a constant time slice .",
    "the latter feature ensures that @xmath0 has the properties of the von neumann entropy .",
    "the cauchy surface of a maximally extended schwarzschild black hole space - time has two disconnected asymptotically flat regions . in section 4",
    "we use this example to formulate the suggestion about the entanglement entropy in the presence of a black hole horizon .",
    "the bifurcation surface of the horizon is a minimal surface on a constant - time slice .",
    "one can relate to this surface an entanglement entropy which coincides with the bekenstein - hawking entropy and corresponds to the loss of information about states located behind the horizon .",
    "the arguments of section 2 based on the path integral approach serve as a motivation .",
    "they can not be considered as a real proof of ( [ i.1 ] ) because they concern an effective theory . in section 5 , we show that our suggestions regarding the entanglement entropy have an important feature : they are consistent with the subadditivity property of the von neumann entropy .",
    "the material of this section is similar to the analysis of the entropy in cft s with gravity duals @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we give examples how to express changes of @xmath0 solely in terms of macroscopical parameters of the system in section 6 .",
    "the examples include changes caused by shifts of a point - like particle and by deformations of a cosmic string located near a separating surface . in section 7",
    "we discuss quantum corrections to formula ( [ i.1 ] ) from low - energy fields and suggest that ultraviolet divergences of an entanglement entropy encountered in qft models are removed in the course of the standard renormalization of gravity couplings .",
    "the paper is ended with a discussion of its results in section 8 .",
    "0      we first recall a path - integral approach to calculation of entanglement entropy in qft models @xcite . consider a stationary space - time @xmath7 with the number of dimensions @xmath8 ( the concrete value of @xmath8 will not be important for our analysis ) .",
    "let @xmath9 be a time - like killing vector field of @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that the system is defined on a domain @xmath10 of a constant time slice @xmath11 .",
    "we also assume that the system is in a thermal state with the temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hamiltonian which is defined as a generator of the evolution of the given system along the killing time @xmath15 .",
    "the reduced density matrix ( [ rdm ] ) is given by a functional integral like ( [ 2.4a ] ) on @xmath7 with a cut along @xmath16 .",
    "the values of the field variables on the both sides of the cut determine the `` indexes '' of the matrix @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the trace like @xmath43 is determined by the path integral ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) follows from ( [ 2.3a ] ) .",
    "the method described above enables one to compute the entanglement entropy in quantum field models .",
    "the calculation can be done in the regularized theory in the presence of an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the dependence on the cutoff @xmath44 has a very simple form @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for instance , the leading divergence in the entropy in a four - dimensional theory is proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the area of the separating surface @xmath1 ( @xmath44 is assumed to have the dimension of a length ) . in condensed matter systems",
    "the entanglement entropy is finite and @xmath44 is a physical parameter associated , for example , with a lattice spacing .      to define the entanglement entropy in a quantum gravity theory one has to answer a number of questions",
    "here are some of them .",
    "\\1 ) the notion of classical geometry may not hold at microscopical scales .",
    "does the definition of a `` separating surface '' make sense in a quantum gravity theory ?",
    "\\2 ) related to the first question is the problem of the entanglement of gravitational degrees of freedom . how can one take into account graviton contributions to the entropy ?",
    "\\3 ) the entanglement entropy of quantum fields is divergent .",
    "can this problem be solved by a traditional prescription based on the renormalization ?",
    "what are the physical constants which should be renormalized ?    to approach these problems we assume that the gravity along with other low - energy fields ( the fields of the standard model , for example ) is an emergent phenomenon , in a sense that the fields represent an effective description of some other underlying fundamental variables .",
    "one can guess that it is the effective nature of the low - energy theory which results in ultraviolet divergences , while the underlying theory does not have this problem .",
    "we assume that the trace over the fundamental degrees of freedom which has to be done to compute the reduced density matrix in the quantum gravity is equivalent to the trace over low - energy variables including fluctuations of the metric .",
    "the `` trajectories '' in ( [ 2.1 ] ) are riemannian manifolds @xmath7 and all possible field configurations living on them .",
    "the number of dimensions of @xmath7 is @xmath8 , @xmath50 .",
    "two dimensional gravity models can be included in our analysis but they require a separate discussion .",
    "the form of `` trajectories '' is specified by the boundary conditions .",
    "it is assumed that manifolds have a boundary @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a @xmath53-dimensional spatial boundary of the system .",
    "we demand that @xmath54 possesses a killing vector field @xmath55 with closed orbits @xmath28 .",
    "the length of the circle @xmath28 is fixed by the inverse temperature .",
    "it will be assumed that @xmath56 is a compact closed manifold .",
    "a typical example of the boundary is @xmath57 .",
    "the partition function depends on the metric @xmath58 of @xmath59 and on values @xmath60 of matter fields on @xmath59 .        the action in ( [ 2.1 ] )",

    "is the gibbons - hawking term which depends on the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath64 of @xmath59 embedded in @xmath7 .",
    "this term is needed to formulate a well - defined variational procedure .      because in a quantum gravity theory the metric except its boundary value can not be fixed a priory , for the same reason the definition of entangled states of a system can be described only in terms of a partition of the boundary .",
    "we take a constant time ( @xmath72 ) slice @xmath73 of @xmath54 and consider division of @xmath73 by a hypersurface @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "the parts @xmath75 and @xmath76 of @xmath73 separated by @xmath74 will be treated as boundaries of two entangled regions .",
    "let @xmath77 be an entanglement entropy which appears when the degrees of freedom inside the region with the boundary @xmath76 are traced out . by bearing in mind the method described in the previous section we relate the entropy to a partition function @xmath78 the function @xmath79",
    "is determined by a parameter @xmath40 where @xmath31 is a natural number .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 can be represented in terms of a sum over geometries , @xmath30 , specified by a boundary condition @xmath80 .",
    "the boundary space @xmath81 is constructed from @xmath59 as follows .",
    "one cuts @xmath59 along the part @xmath76 of the slice @xmath72 and glues @xmath31 identical copies of @xmath59 along the cuts .",
    "spaces @xmath81 have conical singularities on a surface where the cuts meet .",
    "the singular surface is isometric to @xmath82 .",
    "the structure of @xmath81 near the singular surface is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a 2-dimensional cone with the circumference length @xmath40 around the tip .      to summarize , calculation of @xmath79 consists of two steps .",
    "one takes the path integral ( [ 2.1aa ] ) over the class of spaces specified by the presence of the singular surface @xmath1 and then one sums contributions of different classes @xmath89 . as a result , all possible geometries which obey the boundary conditions and have conical singularities on co - dimension",
    "2 hypersurfaces are taken into account .",
    "the definition of @xmath79 is motivated by the form of the qft partition function ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "the summation symbol @xmath91 in ( [ 2.1a ] ) does not have a precise meaning , the situation common for path integrals .",
    "this is not a principle difficulty because we are dealing with an effective theory and our main result will be based on a semiclassical approximation .      to compute the integral ( [ 2.1aa ] ) in the semiclassical approximation one has to take into account the form of the classical gravity action on @xmath89 , @xmath92=-{1 \\over 16\\pi g}\\int_{{\\cal m}_n } d^{d}x\\sqrt{g } \\left(r-2\\lambda\\right ) -{1",

    "of ( [ 2.7 ] ) is an integral over a regular domain of @xmath30 , the last term appears as a result of conical singularities on @xmath1 @xcite do not contribute to ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "this can be shown by using arguments presented in @xcite . ] .",
    "the semiclassical approximation to ( [ 2.1aa ] ) is determined by extrema of the action ( [ 2.7 ] ) on @xmath89 .",
    "because the area of @xmath1 is fixed metric variations should vanish at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , extrema of ( [ 2.7 ] ) are geometries which are solutions to gravity equations ( [ 2.10 ] ) outside @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath95 be such a solution for a class @xmath89 .",
    "any solution @xmath95 with @xmath33 can be constructed from a solution @xmath70 with @xmath96 .",

    "one cuts @xmath70 along a co - dimension 1 hypersurface which starts at the domain @xmath76 of the slice on @xmath54 and ends on @xmath1 ( the precise choice of the surface does not matter ) .",
    "spaces @xmath95 are obtained by gluing @xmath31 identical copies with the same cut so that to get conical singularities on @xmath1 .",
    "because the cut intersects the slice of @xmath54 along @xmath76 the constructed spaces also satisfy the required boundary conditions , @xmath97 .",
    "it is the presence of gravitational degrees of freedom in the functional integral ( [ 2.1aa ] ) which results in ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "the reason why the entropy appears in the semiclassical approximation is explained by the fact that metric is an effective low - energy variable .",
    "one needs to know genuine degrees of freedom of the quantum gravity to write the entropy in a von neumann form ( [ 2.3 ] ) .    as technical remark ,",
    "note that the partition function @xmath79 does not coincide with the gibbons - hawking path integral ( [ 2.1 ] ) in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "the both functionals at the semiclassical level are determined by the same solution @xmath70 to the einstein equations .",
    "however , they differ by a multiplier @xmath110 present in @xmath79 .",
    "formally @xmath110 counts a `` number '' of hypersurfaces embedable in @xmath70 under given boundary conditions .",
    "this difference is not essential because one can remove @xmath110 by changing normalization of @xmath79 .",

    "the entropy ( [ 2.12 ] ) is determined by a least volume minimal hypersurface , i.e. by a _",
    "global minimum _ of the volume functional . finding a minimal surface for a given boundary",
    "is called the _ plateau problem_. if the background metric @xmath116 has a lorentzian signature the hypersurfaces which obey condition ( [ 2.11 ] ) are called _",
    "extremal_.    the r.h.s . of ( [ 2.11 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the connections defined with respect to @xmath116 . if @xmath124 is a unit vector orthogonal to the boundary @xmath125 and tangent to @xmath1",
    "the boundary conditions imply that @xmath126 on @xmath125 . from ( [ 2.11 ] ) and ( [ 2.11a ] )",
    "one gets a euclidean version of the nambu - goto equations @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a laplace operator on @xmath1 and @xmath129 are the christoffel coefficients for @xmath116 .",
    "the conditions for the minimal surface can be also written in another form .",
    "let @xmath130 be a part of the vector @xmath131 which is orthogonal to @xmath1 .",
    "one can write @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 are two unit mutually orthogonal normals to @xmath1 .",
    "one finds @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are traces of extrinsic curvatures of @xmath1 defined with the help of the projector @xmath140 .",
    "the contribution in ( [ 3.3 ] ) of the longitudinal part of the variation @xmath141 ( tangent to @xmath1 ) is a total divergence which vanishes due to the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , equations ( [ 2.11a ] ) are equivalent to @xmath142        we complete this section with brief comments regarding the plateau problem @xcite .",
    "the theory of minimal surfaces appeared from consideration of soap films and it was known since 18-th century .",
    "the plateau problem does not have a unique solution . even in a flat space there",
    "may exist more than one minimal surface for a given boundary contour , see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ( 1,2,3 ) .",
    "the solution is unique if the contour lies in a plane and does not have self - intersections .",
    "note that in three - dimensions there may be contours which can not be boundaries of minimal surfaces with a finite area .",
    "such contours and their higher dimensional analogs are excluded from our analysis .    in general minimal surfaces can be represented as a combination of parts of smooth surfaces glued along their boundaries .",
    "these boundaries may appear as edges of the surfaces .",
    "the minimal surfaces may also have self - intersections and be non - orientable .",
    "finally , the minimal surfaces may have a non - trivial topology , for example , they may have handles , see fig . [ f7 ]",
    "the least area minimal surface for a given boundary contour is not necessary a surface with a simplest topology .",
    "an interesting and a separate issue is the behavior ( stability ) of a minimal surface against small deformations .    except soap films",
    "there are many other examples of minimal surfaces in nature and human activities , e.g in the architecture .",
    "a dna molecule , for instance , has a structure of double helix .",
    "the corresponding minimal surface is a helicoid , one of the four known minimal surfaces that can be embedded in a flat 3-dimensional space without self - intersections .",
    "0    the surface @xmath1 in the entropy formula ( [ i.1 ] ) is embedded in a riemannian manifold @xmath70 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath70 is a euclidean section of some stationary lorentzian space - time @xmath143 .",
    "the metrics of the two spaces are related by the wick rotation , i.e. by the complexification of the killing time .",
    "if the metric is stationary but not static the wick rotation is accompanied by an analytical continuation of some other parameters .",
    "for example , in an axially - symmetric space - time one goes to complex values of the angular velocity parameter .",
    "the same change of parameters has to be done in ( [ i.1 ] ) .    after the wick rotation minimal co - dimension 2 hypersurfaces in @xmath70 correspond to extremal hypersurfaces in @xmath143 . in static lorentzian space - times",
    "extremal hypersurfaces which end on a given slice @xmath73 of the boundary have an important geometrical property .",
    "they are minimal hypersurfaces located in a single constant time slice @xmath144 such that @xmath145 . to prove this statement note that variations of the volume functional ( [ 2.11 ] ) in @xmath143 can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath147 are caused by shifts of the surface along @xmath144 .",

    "it is not difficult to see that the area of the minimal surface in the weak field approximation is given by the integral @xmath252 where @xmath253 is a coordinate of the plane in the absence of the particle . to cutoff the integral ( [ 5.2 ] ) one may assume that the surface has a large but finite size .",
    "the variation of the area of the surface under the change of its position with respect to the particle does not depend on the cutoff @xmath254 the area decreases if the distance @xmath253 increases .",
