    "in the progress of high - energy physics , so - called energy frontier have reached to a few tev region , where discoveries of new phenomena are expected .",
    "in such situation , it is well known that the five unites of electric charge , q  =  0 ,  1/3 ,  2/3 ,  1 ,  4/3 appear in guts@xcite , where the 4/3 charge is carried by @xmath0 gauge boson , which is considered to be the particle responsible for proton decay .",
    "thus , so far as the charge units are concerned , it seems that guts are too complicated to be the final theory of elementary particles .",
    "especially , in any gauge model such as guts , the @xmath4 symmetry concerning to the conservation of electric charge is absolutely maintained in the final stage of steps of symmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the electric charge remains and is conserved even in a critical condition such as the gravitational collapse of matter , where almost all quantum numbers looses their meanings@xcite .",
    "thus , the electric charge seems to be one of the most fundamental quantities in particle physics .",
    "it is known that the simplest model based on the elementarity of electric charge is the rishon model@xcite of leptons and quarks . in this model ,",
    "the leptons and quarks are given as = vvv ,   e^- = [ eq : rishon ] where the @xmath2 rishon has the electric charge @xmath5 , while the @xmath3 rishon is purely electrically neutral .",
    "though models of leptons and quarks are , however , in the stage of schematical model , some remarkable minimal dynamical approaches are proposed@xcite . for further steps ,",
    "it is possible to treat schematically possible processes of sub - constituents under minimal dynamical assumptions for composite system .",
    "on the basis of such approach , we will investigate possible existence of new processes , and possible dynamical approach to sub - system of leptons and quarks .",
    "this paper is concerning to theses problems .",
    "we will assume that leptons and quarks are composite system of sub - constituents confined with the hypercolor singlet conditions , as have been assumed in dynamical rishon mode . in our schematical approach ,",
    "it is pointed out that possible existence of new proton decay mode , which is different from that of guts , is suggested .",
    "we will follow the policy of so - called dynamical rishon model@xcite , where it is assumed that the hypercolor singlet states of composite system are realized as ordinary particles such as leptons and quarks .    though the rishon is assumed to be dirac particle in the dynamical rishon model , while we have proposed , under the development of majorana particle model of neutrinos , majorana v rishon model@xcite . in this paper , however , we will at first restrict ourselves to dirac particle model , and the case of majorana model will be investigated in later .    in the dynamical rishon model@xcite , the exact symmetry realized by the local gauge group , su_3(c ) su_3(h ) [ eq : cxh ] is assumed for rishons , where c and h represents color and hypercolor , respectively .",

    ", we will investigate rearrangements of sub - constituents under the confinement condition , together with possible sub - electroweak structure .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the rearrangement of sub - constituent , possible existence of new mode of proton - decay is suggested , which is different from that of guts case where the proton - decay is mediated by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 gauge bosons with the color index @xmath19 .",

    "( [ eq : beta ] ) is rewritten as ,    ( ) + ( vvv ) ( ttv ) + ( ) [ eq : beta - rishon ]    thus , we see that the fundamental interaction in our process is given as    = g_w^(s ) |t^(1 + _ 5 ) v^c w_^(s ) [ eq : fundamental_int ]    and corresponding current is = |t^(1 + _ 5 ) v^c [ eq : fundamental_current ]    which belongs to @xmath45 representation .",
    "the interaction in the process given by eq.([eq : elementary ] ) , v + t +    which is caused by only @xmath45 single current , should be extremely suppressed .    on the contrary , in our scheme",
    ", the  composite \" process with 3-fold single elementary processes such as eq.([eq : beta - rishon ] ) should be not so suppressed . the single elementary process in eq.([eq : elementary ] )",
    "is expected to be extremely suppressed in the same way as the 3-body quarks are almost completely confined in hadrons and realization of colored configuration is extremely suppressed .",
    "the process such as eq.([eq : beta ] ) or equivalently eq.([eq : beta - rishon ] ) are enhanced , similar to the realization of the 3-body color - singlet states of quarks are enhanced .",
    "that is , the process given in eq.([eq : beta - rishon ] ) is essentially the non - perturbative process with extreme suppression of non - color - singlet currents .",
    "thus , we will investigate possible scheme based on fundamental interaction .",
    "we have introduced the effective interaction corresponding to the rearrangement picture in sub - system .",
    "we will investigate here the possible case that eq.([eq : ew_sub ] ) is not an effective interaction but the most fundamental one .",
    "that is , it is worth while to investigate the possibility that the fundamental interaction cause various effective interactions such as the standard model itself , under the restriction of exact symmetry @xmath8 given in eq.([eq : cxh ] ) . in appearance of effective interaction , especially , color and hypercolor confinement condition",
    "will carry most important role .",
    "it should be noted that this approach is partially similar to the case of meson theory for nuclear force where various properties of nucleus are derived on the basis of qcd .    it should be emphasized that under development along such strategy it may become possible to resolve the hierarchy problem on coupling constants and masses , which are only given as parameters in the standard model or guts .",
    "in progress of neutrino physics , the existence of majorana particle seems to be almost confirmed .",
    "in addition to the neutrinos , are there any majorana particle in nature ?",
    "in such situation , we have proposed in a few years ago a model of leptons and quarks on the basis of possible majorana v theory together with possible existence of its partner in the framework of rishon model@xcite .",
    "we will investigate possible representation of sub - constituent in our majorana v model , under the local gauge group @xmath8 . in the simplest @xmath52 hypercolor model ,",
    "the assignment to realize the hypercolor singlet states is rather complicated@xcite .",

    ", the @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath3 and also assigned to @xmath54 .",
    "the quarks u and d belong to @xmath56 representation .",
    "it should be noted that the results given in the previous sections will be almost maintained in majorana v model , except the appearance of characteristic picture of majorana particles that the fermion number is not conserved .",
    "furthermore , the restrictions due to color and hypercolor confinement will be rather weakened , then possible existence of some new particles are expected .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated possible existence of new proton decay mechanism on the basis of a rearrangement picture of sub - system of leptons and quarks , in which the sub - constituents are confined in leptons and quarks by the color and hypercolor confinement condition based on @xmath8 group .",
    "we have discussed the possibility that the pre - electroweak structure appears in the rishon level , and a certain kind of confinement of pre - gauge bosons realizes the well - known electroweak structure in the level of leptons and quarks . in our approach , it may be possible to calculate the magnitude of coupling constants and the masses of composite leptons and quarks , which are given as parameters in pure field theoretical approaches .",
    "we have assumed in this paper that the gauge structure of the standard model appears as a result of the dynamics of the sub - levels of leptons and quarks .",
    "is the sub - system of leptons and quarks completely subject to quantum mechanics ? it should be noted that the standard formulation of the rishon model is not yet known , and it is probable that the rishon behaves as if it is partially the objects beyond the ordinary quantum field theory@xcite,@xcite . in order to approach to such system , however",
    ", it will be meaningful to treat it in the framework of conventional field theory with color and hypercolor confinement .",
    "finally , is there really a sub - level below the level of leptons and quarks ? in our opinion , such a sub - level surely exists , and disclosing it will make it possible to predict theoretically quantities such as the higgs coupling constants , the magnitudes of symmetry breaking @xmath57 , the mass spectrum and mixing parameters of all particles , etc .",
    "we conclude this paper with the note that we have restricted ourselves in this paper to the proposal of the framework of possible approach to sub - system , and details will be discussed in near future .",
