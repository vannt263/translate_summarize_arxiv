    "the discovery of superconductivity in the iron - based pnictides @xcite has recently led to an intense debate on the question whether coulomb correlations in these materials play a role of similar importance as in the high-@xmath2 cuprates . moreover , in contrast to the effective single - band character of the @xmath5 states in the cuprates , the number of relevant @xmath6 orbitals in the pnictides has also been a subject of discussion .",
    "in addition , because of the multi - band character of the fe @xmath7 bands , the interplay of coulomb repulsion and hund s rule coupling should be of crucial importance for the pnictides .",
    "finally , while it is generally accepted that the non - fermi - liquid pseudogap properties in the underdoped regime of the cuprates are associated with the vicinity to the mott insulating phase , in the pnictides it is not yet clear whether there exists a nearby mott phase in the range of realistic coulomb and exchange energies .    to study the effect of coulomb correlations in iron pnictides ,",
    "various groups have applied single - site dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) . depending on the details of the single - particle hamiltonian and the magnitude of coulomb and exchange energies , weakly or strongly correlated solutions were found . in the present work we extend exact diagonalization@xcite ( ed ) dmft to five orbitals in order to investigate correlations effects in lafeaso as a function of coulomb energy .",
    "the single - particle properties are described in terms of a five - band tight - binding hamiltonian.@xcite each @xmath6 orbital hybridizes with two bath levels , giving @xmath8 levels in total .",
    "the five baths are coupled indirectly via the interorbital @xmath7 coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "thus , the hilbert space is extremely large and finite - size effects are effectively reduced .",
    "the advantage of this multi - orbital ed / dmft approach is that it is particularly useful at low temperatures and that it can handle large coulomb energies and full hund exchange . as will be discussed below",
    ", the latter feature is of special importance in the pnictides since hund s rule coupling leads to electronic properties that differ qualitatively from those obtained for the more approximate ising - like exchange treatment .",
    "the sensitive role of exchange interactions in the pnictides was also noted in several previous papers . @xcite",
    "the main result of this work is the identification of a paramagnetic fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid transition at moderate coulomb energies , @xmath9  ev ( @xmath10  ev ) , i.e. , well below the overall width of the fe @xmath7 bands , @xmath11  ev .",
    "this incoherent metallic phase extends up to rather large values of @xmath12 ( @xmath13  ev if @xmath14 is kept fixed at @xmath15  ev ) .",
    "it is associated with the formation of local moments and with substantial low - frequency scattering rates in all @xmath7 bands . below this transition ,",
    "all bands exhibit strong correlation - induced effective mass enhancement .",
    "these properties are intimately related to the multi - band nature of lafeaso and the hund s rule coupling among the fe @xmath7 subbands . a similar spin freezing transition had been found recenly by werner _",
    "et al._@xcite in a fully degenerate three - band model . within the present five - band system",
    ", a mott phase is not obtained below @xmath16  ev .",
    "thus , correlation effects in lafeaso appear to be related to the formation of local moments within the non - fermi - liquid phase , and not to the vicinity of a mott insulating phase .",
    "on the other hand , lafeaso readily turns into a mott insulator at realistic coulomb energies in the hypothetical limit of one - hole doping , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath7 bands then become half - filled and split into lower and upper hubbard bands . at intermediate hole doping ,",
    "non - fermi - liquid behavior dominates , while for electron doping ( @xmath17 ) the system becomes a normal fermi liquid .",
    "these results suggest a remarkable correspondence between the multi - band compound lafeaso and the two - dimensional single - band hubbard model .",
    "indeed , if the correlation - induced scattering rate is plotted as a function of doping relative to half - filling , i.e. , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 for pure lafeaso ) , both systems exhibit the same sequence of phases for increasing @xmath18 : a mott insulator at half - filling , a non - fermi - liquid phase up to a critical doping of the order of @xmath19 , and a weakly correlated fermi liquid for @xmath20 . in this scenario , the paramagnetic phase diagrams of iron pnictides and cuprates are strikingly similar , with lafeaso ( @xmath21 ) located slightly on the overdoped side above critical doping . as a result ,",
    "the system exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to doping . whereas electron doping beyond @xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) reinforces fermi - liquid properties , hole doping @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) enhances bad - metallic behavior .",
    "although the real material is undoubtedly more complex because of doping - dependent single - particle properties and the presence of antiferromagnetism@xcite at @xmath1 , we believe that the above picture nevertheless provides a useful new perspective for the role of correlation effects in iron pnictides in comparison with analogous physics in the cuprates .",
    "if exchange interactions among fe @xmath7 electrons are approximated in terms of ising - like exchange , i.e. , by neglecting spin - flip and pair - exchange processes , the fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid transition still exists , but the critical value of @xmath12 is shifted down to about @xmath25  ev ( assuming @xmath26 ) and the transition is more abrupt .",
    "similar qualitative changes from hund to ising exchange were found previously also for the mott transition in two - band hubbard models.@xcite    because of the strong hybridization between fe @xmath7 and as @xmath27 and o @xmath28 states , there are indications that an accurate wannier representation should encompass not only @xmath6 but also @xmath29 type basis functions , even if coulomb correlations are explicitly only included among the @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "@xcite a particular consequence of @xmath30 hybridization is that the effective @xmath7 coulomb interaction is considerably reduced .",
    "moreover , coulomb interactions among different @xmath6 states are differently screened , giving rise to nonisotropic intraorbital and interorbital matrix elements .",
    "@xcite the present approach is general in the sense that these choices only affect the single - particle hamiltonian and not the evaluation of the @xmath6 electron self - energy matrix .",
    "nevertheless , in this initial five - orbital ed / dmft study we use , for simplicity , a purely @xmath6 electron tight - binding picture @xcite in order to elucidate the nature of the transition from fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "a more detailed investigation within a @xmath30 formulation is planned for future work . as in previous papers , we focus here on the paramagnetic phase .",

    "ii we discuss several theoretical details concerning the single - particle properties of lafeaso and the ed / dmft procedure that is used to evaluate the fe @xmath7 self - energy components . in section",
    "iii we analyze the results , with particular focus on the differences obtained for hund and ising exchange .",
    "subsection a discusses the neutral system , whereas the effect of doping and the analogy between pnictides and cuprates are the subject of subsection b. section iv contains the summary .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the theoretical details of the multi - band ed / dmft approach used in this work .",
    "the focus is on the role of coulomb correlations within the fe @xmath7 subbands of lafeaso .",

    "the onsite energies are @xmath40  ev , @xmath41  ev , @xmath42  ev , and @xmath43  ev . thus the @xmath44 levels lie @xmath45  ev above the @xmath46 levels .",

    ".  [ phase ] , where , for @xmath110  ev and @xmath26 hund exchange , undoped lafeaso lies just below the fermi - liquid / non - fermi - liquid phase boundary .",
    "smaller @xmath12 and larger @xmath14 would move this point farther below this phase boundary . in the limit of one - hole doping ,",
    "the system is a mott insulator , whereas , for electron doping , fermi - liquid properties dominate . for ising exchange ,",
    "the phase boundary is shifted to roughly 1  ev lower @xmath12 values , so that @xmath12 would have to be less than @xmath158  ev to preserve fermi - liquid behavior .    of course , in real lafeaso",
    ", this phase diagram should be more complicated because of the inevitable modification of the one - electron properties with doping@xcite and because of the antiferromagnetic phase@xcite observed at @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the paramagnetic limit permits to draw an interesting analogy between the present multi - band iron pnictide and the single - band two - dimensional hubbard model that is frequently used to investigate coulomb correlations in high-@xmath2 cuprates .    [ t ! ]    -7 mm  ( a )    -7 mm  ( b ) -1 mm    fig .",
    "[ gvsd](a ) shows the orbital components of the low - frequency scattering rate @xmath159 for lafeaso as a function of electron doping relative to half - filling , i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 for the undoped material . as discussed above , in the limit of one - hole doping ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the system is a mott insulator , while for @xmath22 it becomes a weakly correlated fermi liquid . in the intermediate region , for @xmath24 , the scattering rate increases sharply so that the system is dominated by non - fermi - liquid properties due to the formation of frozen moments .",
    "thus , close to @xmath1 the system is near the fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid phase boundary .",
    "as shown in panel ( b ) , this behavior is remarkably similar to the one found within cluster ed / dmft for hole doping in the two - dimensional hubbard model.@xcite analogous results have been obtained by several groups.@xcite this model yields a mott insulator at half - filling and exhibits a non - fermi - liquid pseudogap phase up to a critical doping @xmath160 . ordinary metallic behavior is restored in the overdoped region , @xmath20 . for electron doping",
    "the results are similar , except for a smaller critical doping which marks the onset of bad - metallic behavior . in view of the analogy seen in fig .",
    "[ gvsd ] , the mott phase that is relevant for lafeaso is not the one that should eventually appear at @xmath1 for large @xmath12 , but the one that exists at realistic values of @xmath12 and @xmath14 at @xmath3 occupancy .    the results discussed above demonstrate that the mott transition in multi - orbital and multi - site hubbard models is far more complex than the paramagnetic metal to insulator transition obtained in single - band , single - site dmft calculations .",
    "the presence of interactions channels involving orbitals or sites not only affects the overall magnitude of the critical coulomb energy , but gives rise to a much richer phase diagram .",
    "in particular , as we have seen here for lafeaso , a frozen - moment , non - fermi - liquid phase emerges between the fermi - liquid and insulating regions .",
    "conceptually , this non - fermi - liquid behavior is closely related to the pseudogap phase in hole - doped cuprates which arises from short - range coulomb correlations .",
    "multi - band ed / dmft has been used to investigate the effect of correlations in the iron pnictide lafeaso .",
    "starting from an accurate five - band tight - binding single - particle hamiltonian , the many - body properties are evaluated by extending single - site ed / dmft to five orbitals , each hybridizing with two bath levels .",
    "this scheme is particularly useful at very low temperatures , large coulomb energies and for fully rotationally invariant hund s rule coupling .",
    "it is shown that correlation effects in lafeaso give rise to a paramagnetic transition from a fermi - liquid phase to a non - fermi - liquid phase at a critical coulomb energy ( @xmath149 screened ) of about @xmath161  ev .",
    "this transition appears to be continuous and is caused by the formation of fe @xmath7 local moments . below this transition ,",
    "the quasi - particle weight of all @xmath6 orbitals is strongly reduced and orbital polarization is less pronounced than in the uncorrelated density functional band structure .",
    "a mott insulating phase does not appear below @xmath16  ev . for ising exchange",
    "the fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid transition also exists , but the critical value of @xmath12 is shifted to about @xmath25  ev . moreover , the transition appears to be first order rather than continuous .    despite the multi - band nature of lafeaso and the important role of exchange interactions , this system exhibits an interesting relationship to the single - band two - dimensional hubbard model if the doping concentration is defined with respect to the half - filled @xmath7 shell . within this picture ,",
    "iron pnictides and cuprates exhibit the same sequence of paramagnetic phases with increasing doping : from mott insulator to bad metal to fermi liquid .",
    "thus , fluctuations between orbitals or lattice sites lead to similar physics . according to the available experimental evidence",
    ", lafeaso is located on the weakly to moderately correlated side of the fermi - liquid to non - fermi - liquid phase boundary .",
    "thus , iron pnictide materials appear to have two parent compounds : the anti - ferromagnetic semi - metal at @xmath1 and the mott insulator at @xmath3 .",
