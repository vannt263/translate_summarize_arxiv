    "we note that any non - zero @xmath48is referred to as a `` variability '' measurement , regardless of the origin being physically interesting or otherwise .",
    "the principal steps in the spectrophotometric calibration of each spectrum in the sdss are : a wavelength - dependent calibration using the observed standard stars on the same plate ; and the tying of the absolute flux scale to the observed psf magnitudes of stars , on the same plate @xcite .",

    "this calculation results in a calibration spectrum for one plate .",
    "we adopt a slightly different methodology from @xcite in which stellar spectra in each plate were used .",
    "our calibration spectrum per plate is calculated using all galaxies present in that plate , as we want to maximize the number of objects in generating the calibration spectrum , and avoid potential systematic effects when applying point source calibration to extended sources .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the majority of the galaxies observed in a given plate are non - variable in time across the two epochs .",
    "even if the galaxies were in fact variable , the method is still applicable because the variable amplitude of several hundred galaxies is not expected to be in phase .",
    "an example calibration spectrum is plotted in fig .  [ fig : corrslope_plate390 ] .",
    "typically the calibration spectra are smooth . to focus on low - order corrections to the galaxy spectra , and to remove noise in the calibration spectrum , we follow @xcite and set the final calibration spectrum per plate as its 5th - order polynomial least - squares fit .",
    "by visual inspection this functional form works well in removing higher - order spurious spectral features .    when constructing the calibration spectrum we drop any plate in which there are less than 10  pairs of galaxy spectra .",
    "we then refine each and every spectrum present in a given plate by using the calibration spectrum , if available .      after removing wavelength - dependent systematics ,",
    "each spectral pair can , in principle , be subjected to a wavelength - independent normalization in their flux densities . in order to obtain an accurate variability measurement of each spectral pair , the total continuum fluxes of the two spectra at a chosen common wavelength region",

    "we reject any spectral pair if there are one or more pixels flagged in either or both spectra in the wavelength region of interest , and we require the flux to be larger than zero at both epochs .",

    "all of the spectral flux or s / n calculations in this paper are carried out with pixel - masking using these flags .",

    "firstly , we note that the pipeline performs well , that the fractional difference between both epoch is about 10% at the shortest wavelength , which is sufficient for many spectral analyses involving emission or absorption lines",
    ". however , continuum residual in fig .",
    "[ spec_284_80160781273923584_before ] is present , which induces a variability ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "after the calibration refinement we are able to obtain a zero continuum variability .    for comparing with the rest - band scaling previously discussed , we also adopt the absolute flux calibration described in @xcite . in this procedure , the spectrum in the low s / n epoch in the duo is scaled wavelength - independently so that its total flux in @xmath5@xmath6\\lambda$]5008 ( vacuum ) is the same as that of the spectrum in the high s / n epoch .",
    "the physical justification is that the @xmath5@xmath6\\lambda$]5008 line generally appears as a narrow line arising from a low - density region , which is believed to be non - variable in time @xcite .",
    "we note that the average @xmath5@xmath6 $ ] ew of galaxy spectra in the full dr6 catalog is a  few   , so for some objects mainly the continuum flux is measured and is expected to be non - variable as well .",
    "the combined procedure of systematics removal and absolute @xmath5@xmath6 $ ] calibration is called `` sys+oiii '' in the following .",
    "the region of influence is set to be 5008    @xmath68  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "when judging which method performs better in analyzing spectral variability , we consider the better method to be the one which minimizes the mean , one standard deviation of the mean ( @xmath69 ) and the one standard deviation sample scatter ( @xmath70 ) of the variability at a fixed spectral s / n . these statistics for the galaxy sample by using the sys+band , sys+oiii and other refinement methods are listed in table  [ tab : fvar ] . at s /",
    "n @xmath71  the sys+band method produces smaller mean and scatter in @xmath48 .",

    "these statistics remain lower in value than those in the sys+oiii even for this reduced interval .",
    "the result suggests that the @xmath5@xmath6\\lambda$]5008 line in some spectra may be impacted by the effect of seeing so that the total observed line flux is different for the two epochs .",
    "the other possible reasons for this discrepancy are : the total line flux is sampled at only a few wavelength bins in the medium resolution sdss spectra , or the line may exhibit intrinsic variability .    to further test the method",

    "the red spectra are defined as objects with classification parameter @xmath72 , and the blue galaxies , @xmath73 . for each plate , the calibration spectrum",

    "the fact that no obvious continuum variability is found is consistent with the expectation from the agn unified model , in which some of the light - emitting ( in our context , continuum - generating ) structures in a narrow - line agn , such as the accretion disk , are obscured by a dusty torus .",

    "we found no evidence of continuum variability in galaxies of eclass types a , b , c , d that is larger than the variability uncertainty .",
    "this agrees with the expectation that stellar light dominates their continuum , as in the narrow - line agns .",
    "we tabulate the upper limits of both the continuum and emission - line variability as a function of spectral type , using the classification schemes eclass and the bpt diagram .",
