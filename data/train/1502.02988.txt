    "study of relativistic models of gravitationally collapsing systems has been receiving considerable attention since oppenheimer and snyder@xcite first examined the collapse of a homogeneous spherical distribution of matter in the form of dust .",
    "it is known that a star which loses its equilibrium , collapses under self gravity , ultimately culminating in the state of space - time singularity .",
    "the state of singularity may be a naked one , in the sense that light rays emanating from it can reach any far - away observer or a black hole implying that the light rays from it may be trapped within a surface called its event horizon .",
    "our understanding about the final outcome of any collapsing stellar configuration is known to rely on a couple of adopted conjectures only in this regard @xcite .",
    "accordingly , studies of realistic models of gravitationally collapsing systems are expected to play a key role in promoting our understanding of the nature and dynamics of the collapsing stellar systems .",
    "many studies aimed at examining various aspects of gravitationally collapsing stellar systems of different kinds of matter distributions have been carried out on varying types of space - time background .",
    "the space - time in the exterior region of a radiating fluid sphere is known to be described by vaidya@xcite metric .",
    "the formulation of the boundary conditions smoothly joining the interior space - time - metric of the collapsing matter across its boundary with the appropriate form of vaidya metric of the exterior space - time , as first proposed by santos@xcite has given a tremendous impetuous for studies in this direction .    in the present work ,",
    "we have proposed a relativistic model of a spherically symmetric matter source , whose collapse is accompanied with dissipation in the form of radial heat flux following santos@xcite .",
    "the background space - time metric is chosen so as to have vanishing weyl tensor implying its conformal flatness .",
    "conformally flat space - times , in the context of radiating fluid spheres , were first studied by som and santos@xcite .",
    "later , the most general class of conformally flat solutions for a shear - free radiating star were obtained and examined by maiti@xcite , modak@xcite , banerjee _ et al_@xcite , patel and tikekar@xcite , sch@xmath0fer and goenner@xcite and ivanov@xcite .",
    "et al_@xcite have critically examined models of shear - free collapsing fluids accompanied with dissipation of heat on the space - time background subject to the constraint that the associated weyl tensor should vanish . in the present approach ,",
    "the geometry of the background space - time of the non - adiabatically collapsing matter is chosen to be conformal to that of the space - time of robertson - walker metric so that the weyl tensor is known to vanish since the robertson - walker space - time is already conformally flat .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the einstein field equations for non - adiabatically collapsing spherical matter distributions with radial heat flow have been formulated on the conformally flat space - time background with pre - assigned metric form .",
    "the pressure isotropy relation in this approach is found to lead to two classes of solutions for the system .",
    "the junction conditions which smoothly join the interior space - time with the exterior vaidya@xcite metric across the boundary surface @xmath1 have been obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the explicit expressions for the physical quantities and the constraints on the model - parameters in view of physical requirements have been obtained . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , specific models have been examined by considering a couple of solutions of the equation governing the evolution of the collapse and their physical viability is shown using graphical methods .",
    "[ sec6 ] contains a discussion accompanied with some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with the space - time describing the interior of a spherically symmetric collapsing matter fluid with radial heat flux with its metric @xmath2.\\label{intm1}\\ ] ] the evolution with time of the configuration is governed by the function @xmath3 determined by relativistic field equations .",
    "the weyl tensor for the space - time of metric ( [ intm1 ] ) will vanish indicating its conformal flatness since the space - time is also conformal to the robertson - walker metric which follows on setting @xmath4 .",
    "the matter content of the collapsing object in the presence of heat flux is described by the energy momentum tensor @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy density , @xmath7 is the isotropic fluid pressure , @xmath8 is the @xmath9-velocity of the fluid and @xmath10 is the radially directed heat flux vector .",
    "subsequently , einstein field equations relating metric potentials of ( [ intm1 ] ) with the dynamical variables of ( [ emt1 ] ) is a system consisting of the following four equations : @xmath11 where an overhead prime ( @xmath12 ) and an overhead dot ( @xmath13 ) denote differentiations with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) lead to @xmath16 eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) usually referred to as pressure isotropy condition is easily integrable and admits two solutions :    * case i : * @xmath17 : @xmath18    * case ii : * @xmath19 : @xmath20 on setting @xmath21 one obtains the frw model of the universe while on setting @xmath22 a constant , one obtains a perfect fluid space - time solution without any dissipation or heat flow .",
    "accordingly , solutions obtained on setting time dependence of the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 appropriately will lead to models of collapsing fluid systems in the presence of heat flux .",
    "note that , in the context of shear - free radiating collapse , the conformally flat space - time metric obtained earlier by herrera _",
    "et al_@xcite has the form ( in coordinates ( @xmath25 ) ) @xmath26 ^ 2}{[\\tilde{\\xi}(\\tilde{t})\\tilde{r}^2+\\tilde{\\eta}(\\tilde{t})]^2 } d\\tilde{t}^2 - \\frac{1}{[\\tilde{\\xi}(\\tilde{t})\\tilde{r}^2+\\tilde{\\eta}(\\tilde{t})]^2}\\left[d\\tilde{r}^2 + \\tilde{r}^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right].\\label{herrm1}\\ ] ] obviously , the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) is a sub - class of the herrera _ et al_@xcite model which can be obtained by setting @xmath27 in eq .",

    "further , if we set @xmath28 and make the following coordinate transformations @xmath29 the solution ( [ sol2 ] ) can be obtained from ( [ herrm1 ] ) by identifying the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the solution ( [ sol2 ] ) also turns out to be a sub - case @xmath32 a constant of eq .",
    "( [ herrm1 ] ) . since all conformally flat space - times are conformally related , this is expected .",
    "it should be stressed here that even though the classes of solutions obtained in this paper are special cases of the conformally flat solution of @xcite , the solutions have been obtained by adopting a different approach .",
    "the conformally flat solution of @xcite has been obtained by equating the weyl tensor of the associated space - time to zero while the solutions reported in this paper have been obtained by imposing the pressure isotropy condition in a space - time with geometry conformal to a conformally flat robertson - walker space - time .",
    "the space - time geometry of the non - adiabatically collapsing fluid sphere continues to be conformal to the homogeneous geometry of the rw space - time as the collapse proceeds .",
    "in addition , the two classes of solutions have the following distinctive features .",

    "the space - time degenerates to that of a frw fluid sphere without heat flux when @xmath36 .",
    "it is noteworthy that our choice of curvature coordinates brings out to attention the role of the curvature parameter @xmath37 of rw space - time explicitly in the evolution of the collapse .",
    "the space - time exterior to the collapsing matter source will be filled with radiation and is appropriately described by the vaidya@xcite metric for a radiating star @xmath38 .",

    "following santos@xcite , we shall stipulate the boundary conditions which ensure continuity of ( i ) the metrics of the interior and exterior space times with that on @xmath1 , and ( ii ) the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures of @xmath1 .",

    "this approach brings out the nature of impact of the spatial geometry determined by the curvature parameter @xmath37 on the evolution of the collapse in the presence of dissipation .",
    "further the approach also indicates the inter - dependence between the inhomogeneities in the matter density distribution and presence of dissipative processes during the evolution of the collapse .",
    "the mass of the particular collapsing configuration of case @xmath70 of approach i , tends to zero as collapse progresses indicating that all energy is radiated away as heat as in a case indicated earlier by banerjee _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "however , in the case discussed in approach ii , it is not so .    to summarize ,",
    "the class of conformally flat solutions reported in this article have been utilized to generate physically viable models of spherically symmetric gravitationally collapsing systems dissipating energy in the form of radial heat flux . as for the future investigations ,",
    "since maxwell s equations are conformally invariant , it would be interesting to incorporate charge into our model and investigate the impact of electromagnetic field on the overall evolution of the system .",
