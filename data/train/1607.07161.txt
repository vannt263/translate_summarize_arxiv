    "in recent years , the superconducting spintronics has attracted much attention for providing new methods to control over the spin degree of freedom based on the spin - triplet cooper pairs and bogoliubov quasiparticles.@xcite on one hand , the triplet cooper pairs combine both the features of the spintronics@xcite and superconductivity , offering the possibility to realize the spin - polarized supercurrent.@xcite on the other hand , as the quasiparticle charge depends on its momentum in the conventional superconductor , which is exactly zero at the fermi momentum , it is promising to tune the spin degree of freedom with weak disturbance on the charge one in one system.@xcite to reveal the physics in the superconducting spintronics , the spin dynamics for both the spin - polarized cooper pairs and quasiparticles has been intensively studied.@xcite    specifically , for the quasiparticle , rich physics has been reported in the studies on the charge or spin injection from the non - magnetic metal or ferromagnet to the conventional superconductor.@xcite it is shown that the injection of one electron with charge @xmath1 into the superconductor can add one cooper pair with charge @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 and a quasiparticle with charge @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 , respectively.@xcite here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 with @xmath9 representing the kinetic energy of the electron and @xmath10 being the chemical potential in the superconductor ; @xmath11 denotes the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle with @xmath12 being the superconducting order parameter . accordingly , in the steady state , the injected charge and spin are mainly carried by the cooper pairs and quasiparticles separately , indicating that the spin - charge separation can be realized during the injection.@xcite it is further noticed that in the process of the charge and spin injections , the non - equilibrium charge and/or spin imbalance can be created.@xcite it is then revealed that in the dynamical process , to maintain the charge neutrality , the cooper pair condensate can respond to the dynamics of the injected quasiparticles.@xcite accordingly , the study on the quasiparticle dynamics itself is essential to further reveal the dynamics of cooper pairs .    among the quasiparticle dynamics ,",

    "furthermore , it is further found that the injected spin current in the superconducting al can significantly influences the quasiparticle srt , with the spin relaxation behavior in the superconducting state resembling the normal one when the injected spin current is large.@xcite as rich physics is revealed in the elliott - yafet mechanism in the superconducting metal , it is intriguing to study the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism,@xcite which is more important for materials without center - inversion symmetry , in the superconducting state .",
    "furthermore , the proximity - induced superconductivity has been realized in inas@xcite and gaas@xcite heterostructures , offering the chance to study the dp mechanism in the superconducting semiconductors .",
    "it is noted that in the study of the dynamics in superconducting system , different kinetic equations based on the quasiclassical@xcite and quasiparticle@xcite approximations are used .",

    "moreover , we show that the anomalous correlations around the fermi surface are efficiently suppressed due to the emergence of the blocking region ( refer to sec .  [ distribution and correlation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the quasiparticle density increases with the increase of the superconducting velocity . in this process",

    "finally , it is revealed that when the blocking region appears , the momentum current contributed by the quasiparticles flows in the opposite direction to the one due to the cooper pairs .",
    "accordingly , due to the competition of the cooper pairs and quasiparticles in the blocking region , there exists a peak in the superconducting - velocity dependence of the momentum current , whose position corresponds to the appearance of the blocking region .",
    "we then study the quasiparticle spin relaxation in the superconducting qws .",
    "based on the quasiparticle approximation due to the small fermi energy in qws , the kinetic spin bloch equations ( ksbes)@xcite for the quasiparticle is set up with the soc and quasiparticle - impurity scattering explicitly considered . by using the ksbes , we calculate the srt without and with the superconducting velocity , respectively .",
    "rich physics is revealed . without the supercurrent , we address that the branch - mixing scattering@xcite due to the impurity represented by the black arrow in fig .",
    "[ figyw1](a ) is forbidden . here ,",
    "the branch - mixing scattering is referred to as the scattering of quasiparticles between the electron - like and hole - like branches.@xcite this indicates that the electron- and hole - like branches are independent and hence only the intra - branch spin relaxation channel exists . in this situation ,",
    "when @xmath17 tends to zero , the srt recovers to the normal one . whereas with a finite order parameter",
    ", it is found that in the superconducting state , no matter the scattering is weak or strong , the srt is enhanced compared to the normal one , whereas the boundary between the weak and strong scattering regimes is unchanged .",
    "this comes from the efficient suppressions of the soc and impurity scattering for the quasiparticle by the same factor @xmath46 .    with the supercurrent ,",
    "the quasiparticle spin relaxations with extremely small ( @xmath47  mev ) and finite ( @xmath48  mev ) order parameters are explored .",
    "when the order parameter is extremely small ( e.g. , @xmath49  mev ) , the branch - mixing scattering is still forbidden [ refer to fig .",
    "[ figyw1](b ) ] .",
    "this is because the coherence factor ( @xmath50 ) in the quasiparticle - impurity scattering tends to zero .",
    "however , differing from the situation without the supercurrent , when the blocking region emerges , the fermi surfaces from the electron- and hole - like branches are _ not closed _",
    ", referred to as `` fermi arcs '' . in fig .",
    "[ figyw2 ] , the fermi arcs from the electron- and hole - like branches are represented by the gray and red dashed curves in the left and right boundaries of the blocking region .",
    "one observes that in the electron- or hole - like fermi arc , the angular - average of effective magnetic field due to the soc ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) is not zero .",
    "when the condensation process is slow , which can be associated with the annihilation of quasi - electron and quasi - hole,@xcite the spin polarizations mainly relaxes within the fermi arcs .",
    "it is revealed that the quasiparticle spin relaxation at the fermi arc exhibits anomalous features in the _ strong _ scattering regime .",
    "specifically , on one hand , the spin oscillations can be induced by the superconducting velocity ; on the other hand , the spin relaxation becomes _ insensitive _ to the momentum scattering .",
    "the latter phenomenon is in contrast to the conventional dp relaxation , where the spin relaxation is suppressed by the momentum scattering ( motional narrowing effect@xcite ) .",
    "we reveal that the nonzero angular - average of the soc in one fermi arc corresponds to an effective zeeman field .",
    "this effective zeeman field can cause the spin oscillations even in the strong scattering regime , which nevertheless has little influence on the spin relaxation .",
    "actually , this feature provides a direct proof for the existence of the fermi arc .",
    "it is further shown that by switching off the effective zeeman field , the magnitude of the residue effective magnetic field _ strongly _ depends on the direction of the momentum , causing an effective modular - dependent inhomogeneous broadening@xcite even for the elastic scattering .",
    "this modular - dependent inhomogeneous broadening can be enhanced by the momentum scattering in the strong scattering regime and tends to enhance the spin relaxation .",

    ", the branch - mixing scattering is forbidden , and the spin polarization in the electron- and hole - like bands relaxes independently .",
    "this is referred to as the intra - branch spin relaxation .",

    "there exist the intra- and inter - branch spin relaxation channels for the quasiparticle spin relaxation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figyw2 ] .",
    "furthermore , we reveal the role of the intra- and inter - branch spin relaxation channels on the spin relaxation in both the weak and strong scattering regimes .",
    "specifically , in the weak scattering regime , the intra - branch spin relaxation channel is dominant ; whereas in the strong scattering regime , the inter - branch channel becomes dominant when the blocking region appears .",
    "moreover , in the strong scattering regime , with the branch - mixing scattering efficiently triggered , the quasi - electron can feel all the soc around the fermi surface , whose angular - average is zero ( refer to fig .",
    "[ figyw2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , in the strong scattering regime , in contrast to the situation with extremely small order parameter , no spin oscillation occurs .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the dp spin relaxation for the quasiparticle with a novel superconducting - velocity  tunable state in gaas ( 100 ) qws in proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor , by the ksbes derived in the quasiparticle approximation . in the superconducting qw",
    ", the superconducting velocity induced from the superconducting phase is shown to cause the tilt of the quasiparticle energy spectrum .",
    "it is found that when the quasiparticle energy spectrum is tilted to be smaller than the chemical potential , a blocking region corresponding to the negative excitation energy appears , which is in the crescent shape .",
    "the existence of the blocking region can significantly influence the cooper pairings , quasiparticle density and momentum current in qws .",
    "specifically , the center - of - mass momentum @xmath43 is carried by the cooper pairs , with the anomalous correlations only existing between the states with momentum @xmath44 and @xmath45 . moreover ,",
    "the cooper pairings around the electron fermi surface are efficiently suppressed .",
    "furthermore , the quasiparticle density increases with the increase of the superconducting velocity . particularly , the degenerate regime can be realized and the fermi surface around the blocking region for the quasiparticles appears . the quasiparticle fermi surface is constituted by the electron- and hole - like fermi arcs",
    "finally , it is revealed that when the blocking region appears , the momentum current contributed by the quasiparticles flows in the opposite direction to the one carried by the cooper pairs .",
    "thus , in the superconducting velocity dependence of the momentum current , a peak arises due to the competition of the cooper pairs and quasiparticles in the blocking region , whose appearance corresponds to the emergence of the blocking region .",
    "we then study the dp spin relaxation for the quasiparticles in the superconducting qws by the ksbes .",
    "the ksbes for the quasiparticle is set up based on the quasiparticle approximation , in which the soc and quasiparticle - impurity scattering are explicitly considered . by using the ksbes , the srts without and with the supercurrent",
    "are calculated .",
    "rich physics is revealed . without the supercurrent , we address that the branch - mixing scattering@xcite due to the impurity is forbidden , indicating that the electron- and hole - like branches are independent and hence only the intra - branch spin relaxation channel exists . in this situation ,",
    "when @xmath17 tends to zero , the srt recovers to the normal one . whereas with finite order parameter",
    ", we find that compared to the normal state , both the soc and quasiparticle - impurity scattering are efficiently suppressed due to the _ same _ coherence factor @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to the enhancement of the srt in both weak and strong scattering regimes with the boundary between the weak and strong scattering regimes unchanged .    when the supercurrent is turned on",
    ", the fermi arc has intriguing effect on the dp spin relaxation , which exhibits very different physics depending on the magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "specifically , when the order parameter is extremely small ( e.g. , @xmath49  mev ) , the branch - mixing scattering is still forbidden because the coherence factor ( @xmath286 ) tends to be zero in the quasiparticle - impurity scattering , indicating that the electron- and hole - like fermi arcs are independent .",
    "anomalous features are revealed for the quasiparticle spin relaxation at the fermi arc in the _ strong _ scattering regime .",
    "specifically , on one hand , the spin oscillations can be induced by the superconducting velocity ; on the other hand , the srt becomes insensitive to the momentum scattering .",
    "the latter feature is in contrast to the motional narrowing feature in the conventional dp relaxation,@xcite in which the spin relaxation is suppressed by the momentum scattering .    with the _",
    "finite _ order parameter ( @xmath52  mev ) , the situation becomes different .",
    "it is revealed that the tilt of the energy spectrum can trigger the branch - mixing scattering .",
    "in this situation , there exist not only the intra - branch spin relaxation channel , but also the inter - branch one .",
    "furthermore , we reveal the role of the intra- and inter - branch spin relaxation channels on the spin relaxation in both the weak and strong scattering regimes .",
    "specifically , in the weak scattering regime , the intra - branch spin relaxation channel is dominant ; whereas in the strong scattering regime , the inter - branch channel becomes dominant when the blocking region appears .",
    "moreover , it is found that in contrast to the situation with an extremely small order parameter , in the strong scattering regime , no spin oscillation occurs and the spin relaxation is suppressed by the momentum scattering .    up till now , what predicted in this investigation has not yet been experimentally reported and we expect that our work will bring experimental attention .",
    "for the novel superconducting - velocity - tunable quasiparticle state in the qws , the suppressed cooper pairings , large quasiparticle density and non - monotonically tunable momentum current can be directly measured , which reflects the information of the tilted quasiparticle energy spectrum and the emergence of the blocking region . for the quasiparticle spin relaxation , when the order parameter is extremely small as reported in ref .",
    "( @xmath287  @xmath27ev ) , in the presence of the supercurrent , the spin oscillations and the insensitiveness of the srt on the impurity density can provide the evidence for the existence of the fermi arcs ; when the order parameter is finite , in the strong scattering regime , the absence of the spin oscillations and the suppression of the srt by the relatively large superconducting velocity ( larger than the critical velocity ) show the effect of the branch - mixing scattering on the quasiparticle spin relaxation .    finally , we point out that the existence of the fermi arcs can be markedly influenced by the dynamics of the quasiparticle condensation .",
    "it is important that the condensation rate is slower than the spin relaxation one .",
    "however , up till now , the details of the condensation process are not clear in superconductors,@xcite not to mention in the system proximity to a superconductor .",
    "therefore , the study on the spin dynamics and the existence of the fermi arc can even shed light on the condensation process .",
    "in this appendix , we show the spin oscillations induced by the superconducting velocity in the strong scattering regime with extremely small order parameter .",
    "it has been addressed in sec .",
    "[ with_superfluid ] that the angular - average of the effective magnetic field in one fermi arc is not zero , which acts as an effective zeeman field . accordingly , even in the strong scattering regime , this effective zeeman field can lead to the spin oscillations .    in fig .",
    "[ figyw11 ] , it is shown by the red solid curve that when the order parameter is extremely small ( @xmath49  mev ) , in the strong scattering regime ( @xmath258 ) with the supercurrent ( @xmath288 ) , the spin polarization oscillates in the temporal evolution .",
    "mev ( the red solid curve ) and finite order parameter @xmath122  mev ( the green chain curve ) . @xmath288 the impurity density is @xmath258 , indicating that the system lies in the strong scattering regime .",
    "the blue dashed curve represents the situation by switching off the branch - mixing scattering.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    whereas with a finite order parameter @xmath122  mev , it is shown by the green chain curve that the oscillations vanish .",
    "this is because in the strong scattering regime here , the triggered branch - mixing scattering becomes important .",
    "thus , the quasi - electron can feel the soc around the fermi surface , whose angular - average is exactly zero . by arbitrarily switching off the branch - mixing scattering , the spin oscillations of the spin polarization occur , shown by the blue dashed curve .",
