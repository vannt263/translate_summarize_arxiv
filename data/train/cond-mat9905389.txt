    "these equations of state are then used to compute phase diagrams , or are used in geodynamic or shock compression modeling , etc .",
    "a recent book by anderson ( 1995 ) comprehensively reviews equation - of - state formulations , and comprehensive reviews and comparisons of equations of state are given by hama and suito ( 1996 ) , stacey et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , and duffy and wang ( 1998 ) .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to discuss the reasons for the accuracy of the most - used formulation , based on the birch equation of state ( birch 1978 ) and compare with the vinet equation of state ( vinet et al .",
    "jeanloz ( 1988 ) has previously shown that the birch equation of state and the vinet equation of state can be similar up to moderate compressions . here",
    "we show that this breaks down at high compressions , and for highly compressible materials the vinet equation of state is considerably more accurate .",
    "a logarithmic equation of state ( poirer and tarantola 1998 ) and another exponential equation of state ( holzapfel 1996 ) are discussed and compared with the vinet and birch equations .",
    "finally , we show how subtle transitions can be detected by deviations from an equation of state .",
    "the above equations of state are appropriate for isothermal data . to include thermal expansivity there are three main approaches that have been used .",
    "the first is to fit isotherms , and then tabulate or fit the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion $ ] as functions of temperature . since",
    "experimental data are not always collected along isotherms , that method is most amenable to analysis of theoretical results .",
    "secondly , one can assume debye and mie - gruneisen theory , and fit parameters for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 to include thermal effects .",
    "thirdly , one can directly model the thermal pressure .",
    "see anderson ( 1995 ) , hama and suito ( 1996 ) , and duffy and wang ( 1998 ) for further discussion of thermal equations of state .    in order to test equation - of - state formulations ,",
    "it is important to study large compressions , because most common equations of state will work reasonably over small compression ranges .",
    "thus we choose to study the very compressible materials , hydrogen and neon .",
    "we also consider tantalum and platinum , which are useful pressure standards .",
    "the birch equation of state ( birch 1978 ) is based on a series expansion of pressure    @xmath7   \\label{birch}\\ ] ]    in terms of the eulerian strain @xmath8 , where    @xmath9 . \\label{eulerian}\\ ] ]    and @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion $ ]  are the zero pressure volume , bulk modulus , and bulk modulus pressure derivative .",
    "truncated as written it is called the `` third - order '' birch equation . the fourth - order birch equation , which includes another term in @xmath11 and @xmath12 is useful for theoretical equations of state , but when applied to experimental data , the added parameter usually induces severe correlations in parameters so that they lose physical significance .",
    "the vinet equation ( vinet et al . 1987 ) is derived from a scaled approximate form for the energy : @xmath13 ; \\text { } a^{\\ast } = \\frac{r - r_{0}}{l }   \\label{universale}\\ ] ] where @xmath14  is the binding energy , and @xmath15  is the length per electron .",

    "[ eulerian ] , giving at third - order ,    @xmath29 .",
    "\\label{log}\\ ] ]    now we examine the application of these equations of state for several materials . first we consider the extremely compressible behavior of hydrogen .",
    "hemley et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed in analyses of x - ray diffraction data for hydrogen that the vinet equation of state is considerably more accurate than the birch equation .",
    "the experimental equation of state , ( room temperature data is corrected to 4 k ) , is shown in figure 1 along with equation - of - state fits , and the fitted parameters and @xmath30 are shown in table [ table : h2 ] . for most of the fits , @xmath1 was fixed at its known value , 23.0 @xmath31/mole ( silvera 1980 ) .",
    "the best fit is given by the vinet equation of state , with acceptable fits using birch or holzapfel , but the logarithmic equation of state fails completely .",
    "when the parameter @xmath1 is relaxed for the vinet equation there is no significant change in the fit , and the parameters become less well determined .",
    "figure 1b shows the residuals of the fits ( the logarithmic residuals go off scale as shown ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a peak in the residuals at 40 gpa , which may be a subtle transition , or change in compression mechanism , previously undiscovered , or a small problem with a subset of the data .",
    "note that this deviation is completely invisible on the p - v curve itself .",
    "this illustrates the usefulness of having a good equation - of - state formulation ; even small deviations may indicate possible transitions that should be examined more closely .",
    "secondly , it illustrates that one only expects equations of state to work well under compression with no underlying transitions .",
    "if there are even subtle electronic or structural transitions , these will affect the equation of state significantly .",
    "one of the tests of an equation - of - state fit is the accuracy with which it reproduces known zero - pressure parameters . to this end",
    ", high - pressure static compression data can be compared with low - pressure elasticity measurements , including data from ultrasonic experiments , brillouin scattering , or in some cases high - precision static compression data .",
    "useful low - pressure static compression data exist for hydrogen because of its very high compressibility .",
    "swenson and anderson ( 1974 ) reported k@xmath32 0.17@xmath330.06 gpa for n - h@xmath0 from volumetric strain measurements to 2.5 gpa at 4.2 k. the results are in excellent agreement with those of wanner and meyer ( 1973 ) , who obtained k@xmath34 0.174@xmath330.010 gpa for single - crystal n - h@xmath0 at 4.2 k using ultrasonic methods .",
    "the latter number provides the best comparison with the present analysis ( e.g. , for n - h@xmath0 ) .",

    "udovidchenko and manzhelli ( 1970 ) performed accurate static compression ( volumetric ) measurements on p - h@xmath0 from 0 to 18 mpa ( down to 6 k ) and obtained k@xmath36 = 0.186@xmath330.006 gpa .",

    "the vinet @xmath10 is close to that determined directly , but the birch and holzapfel @xmath10 s are way too high .",
    "the deviation in @xmath40 with the vinet equation may be due to being thrown off by the equation of state glitch at 40 gpa , or may be due to insufficient flexibility in the vinet equation over this large compression range . in order to examine this possibility , we considered the extended vinet equation given by moriarty ( 1995 ) and vinet et al .",

    "as shown in table [ table : h2 ] , @xmath44 , now in excellent agreement with the ultrasonic bulk modulus .",
    "the peak in residuals survives this higher - order fit .",
    "other extensions to the vinet equation are possible , and it would seem more physical to add further terms to the prefactor of eq .",
    "[ universale ] , such as @xmath45 , rather than terms in the exponential , but such extended equations of state will not be considered further here .",
    "secondly , we consider another soft material , ne , from fitting theoretical linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw)(singh 1994 ) local density approximation ( lda)(hedin and lundqvist 1971 ) results .",
    "figure 2 shows the fitted equation of state , the residuals of the fit , and the resulting pv curves .",
    "equation - of - state parameters are shown in table [ table : ne ] .",
    "only the vinet and birch equations are compared since the logarithmic equation of state fails above for h@xmath0 , and the energy expression obtained from integrating the holzapfel pv equation is not closed form .",
    "the vinet equation is superior to the birch equation again , and does an excellent job simultaneously over the large energy scale of large compressions , and the small energy scale near the minimum .",
    "we also show results for the fourth - order birch equation , which in spite of an additional parameter , is still not as good as the vinet equation . as more parameters are added , the quality of the fit improves , but the correlations among individual parameters increases .",
    "next we consider equations of state of two stiff metals , ta and pt ( tables [ table : ta ] and [ table : pt ] and figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "energies were computed using the lapw method and the generalized gradient approximation [ gga - pbe , ( perdew et al . 1996 ) ] . the vinet equation fits better than the birch equation for pt , but for ta the birch equation fits better . however , examination of the residuals for ta ( fig .",
    "4c ) shows that there is a  peak in the residuals at @xmath4610.5 @xmath47 , and closer study shows a change in the occupied bands ( and thus the fermi surface ) around that volume , where the t@xmath48 states at @xmath49 move below the fermi level , e@xmath50 , ( fig .",
    "5 ) so the improved fit using birch is a side effect of this anomaly . fitting only the data above 13",
    "@xmath47 shows a greatly improved fit , and a better fit for vinet than birch .",
    "this again illustrates the utility of examining residuals from well founded equations of state such as the vinet equation in order to find subtle transitions .",
    "we have considered a range of materials from very compressible to more incompressible , covering the entire range of compression of minerals and volatiles in the earth .",
    "an equation of state reflects the underlying interactions potential among the ions and electrons that make up a crystal .",
    "thus , a useful way to compare different equations of state is to compare the implied assumptions about the interaction potential .",
    "first we consider the birch equation in some detail . as normally expressed , it is not obvious that the birch equation in terms of eulerian strain    @xmath51 ^{n}\\text { , }   \\label{birche}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 , is actually a series for energy @xmath53 in @xmath54 .",
    "for example , if @xmath55    @xmath56    the @xmath57 powers arise from distance squared in finite strain theory , so one can think of the birch equation as a series in `` inverse length squared . ''",
    "the reason only even terms in length are included is in order to preserve rotational invariance in the strain energy expansion for general strains .",
    "thus , the birch equation assumes that the underlying potential can be represented as a series in @xmath58 . the commonly used third - order birch equation ( with parameters @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion $ ] ) includes @xmath59,@xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "now , it is well known that polynomials can behave poorly ( wiggle ) and extrapolate poorly ( go crazy outside the range of the fit ) , and this is in fact a problem with using the birch equation to too high an order .",
    "note also that it is not a convergent series ( unless the coefficients obey @xmath62 , which is not expected in a fit ) . under compression , @xmath63 so that for larger @xmath64 the terms @xmath65 blow up .",
    "the truncated series may still do well , as it does up to moderate compressions , if the truncated series represents the interatomic potential accurately . however , there is no fundamental reason to expect @xmath58 to well represent interatomic interactions , so it is not surprising that the birch equation is not perfect .",
    "indeed , the energy expression from the birch equation has a non - physical hump at expanded volumes that then decays with increasing volume , whereas the vinet and holzapfel equations converge smoothly to a constant at large volumes , being consistent with physically based potentials .",
    "the logarithmic equation of state unphysically diverges with expansion .",
    "another question that often arises with regard to the birch equation is why @xmath66{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion = 4 $ ] often works so well .",
    "note that for moderate compressions ( say 10% or less ) higher order terms in eq .",
    "[ birch ] are quite small . for example , if @xmath67 , then @xmath68 , so that deviations from @xmath3{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion = 4 $ ] are only reflected in a few percent or less of the pressure , and higher order terms , with factor @xmath69 are only affected at the 0.1% level",
    ".    the lagrangian strain @xmath70 can be used instead of the eulerian strain ( thomsen 1970 ) , but the lagrangian equation of state is not satisfactory at high pressures since it saturates with increasing density .",
    "the lagrangian strain gives a series in @xmath53    @xmath71 ^{n}=\\sum_{n=0}^{n}b_{n}\\eta ^{\\frac{2n}{3 } }   \\label{lagrangiane}\\ ] ]    which has the advantage that the series converges in @xmath72 for @xmath73 , but since @xmath74 does not look like an interatomic potential , it does not work well compared with the eulerian strain .",
    "the hencky ( logarithmic ) strain ( poirer and tarantola 1998 ) @xmath75 shares a similar shortcoming . though it looks reasonable as a measure of finite strain the effective potential",
    ", @xmath76 is not very physical .",
    "the hencky potential can be expanded to look like @xmath77{0xb4}}% % beginexpansion { \\acute{}}% % endexpansion -7)}$ ] ( poirer and tarantola 1998 ) . the attractive part is long - ranged and ill - conditioned and the repulsive part is too soft .",
    "in contrast , the vinet equation is based on a potential at the outset ( eq . [ universale ] ) .",
    "this potential was introduced by rydberg ( 1932 ) , who used it not for an equation of state ( stacey et al .",
    "1981 ) , but as a form for the _ intra_molecular potential in h@xmath0 and other simple molecules for obtaining solutions to the anharmonic schrodinger equation for fitting and comparison to molecular vibrational spectra .",
    "the vinet equation of state works surprisingly well for a wide range of types of materials , and for compressions of up to @xmath78 , as has been discussed in detail ( hama and suito 1996 ; vinet et al .",
    "note the sign errors in eq .",
    "102 of stacey et al .",
    "( 1981 ) .",
    "one failure of the vinet equation is that it does not give the proper behavior at even greater compressions , and does not merge into electron gas ( thomas - fermi ) , or quantum - statistical ( kalitkin and kuzmina 1972 ) behavior at extreme compression .",
    "holzapfel found expressions that do have the proper limiting form , such as eqs .",

    "an equation of state that agrees with the quantum statistical model ( kalitkin and kuzmina 1972 ) at extreme compression , which is obtained by assuming homogeneous compression of spherical atoms and expanding the hartree - fock equations in density and dropping terms of order @xmath81 and higher , was developed by hama and suito ( 1996 ) .",
    "this should become accurate at lower pressures than thomas - fermi .",
    "we did not test this here , but in hama and suito s tests , it seems to work well from 0 to 10 fold compression or more fore rare gases , simple metals , and ionic compounds .",

    ", in comparing equations of state , note that correlations among @xmath25 , @xmath10 and @xmath26 are much lower for vinet than birch , so parameters are better determined . in the vinet equation , @xmath26 is inside exponential , and @xmath10 in the prefactor , whereas in the birch equation @xmath10 and @xmath26 appear as products . in any case",

    "this is one advantage of theory ; results are available at negative pressure and @xmath25 can be well constrained .    for strains less than 30% ,",
    "it probably does nt matter what equation of state you use , as was emphasized by jeanloz ( 1988 ) , but parameters will still be better determined with the vinet equation ( see also hemley et al . 1990 ) . for large strains ,",
