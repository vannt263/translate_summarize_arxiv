    "the event shapes are relevant to the properties of hadronic final state .",
    "one has employed the hadronic event shape measurements to test asymptotic freedom and to extract the strong coupling constant , etc . in the @xmath7 annihilation and lepton deep inelastic scattering , respectively , for a long time @xcite .",
    "recently , the final hadronic event shapes in pp collisions at the lhc energies have been measured by cms @xcite , alice @xcite , and atlas @xcite .    in order to avoid bias from the boost along beam axis",
    "@xcite , this study is restricted to the transverse momentum plane .",
    "we start from the transverse momentum matrix of the produced charged particles @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of particle @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding transverse momentum components , and the sum runs over the charged particles in a single event .",

    "the event averaged transverse momentum sphericity is then denoted as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 indicates an average over events .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite that the transverse momentum azimuthal asymmetry is measured by the dimensionless observable @xmath23^{1/2}. \\label{assy}\\ ] ] it is easy to prove @xmath24 corresponding to the @xmath19 limits in eq .",
    "( [ limi1 ] ) @xmath25 possesses the limits of @xmath26 and therefore @xmath25 is also a measure of the degree of transverse momentum azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "the event averaged transverse momentum asymmetry is denoted as @xmath27 .",
    "pythia6.4 @xcite is used to calculate the charged particle transverse momentum sphericity as a function of charge multiplicity , @xmath28 , in @xmath290.5 gev / c and @xmath300.8 , for the minimum bias pp collisions at @xmath4=0.9 and 7 tev .",
    "these results ( red solid diamonds , indicated as pythia6 ) are compared with the corresponding alice data of  all \" events ( black open circles , indicated as alice ) @xcite in fig .",

    "one sees here that the results of pythia6 , like pythia8 , are not consistent with the alice data .",
    "one way out is to invoke the various pythia6 tunes .",
    "they are based on pythia6.4 but with a couple of extra model parameters , relevant to the soft- and/or hard - processes as well as the parton distribution function etc . , fitting to the experimental data .",
    "for example , in the perugia-2011 tune @xcite  the data sets used to constrain the models include hadronic @xmath31 decay at lep , tavatron min - bias data at 630 , 1800 , and 1960 gev , tevatron drell - yan data at 1800 and 1960 gev , and sps min - bias data at 200 , 546 , and 900 gev \" .",

    "the blue open triangles indicated as perugia in fig .",
    "[ spheri_2 ] ) among the pythia6 tunes .",
    "we prefer to have a more simplified modification for the pythia6.4 model .",
    "a rearrangement method is proposed , in which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of produced particle from the pythia6.4 simulations are randomly rearranged on the circumference of an ellipse with the half major and minor axes of @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the transverse momentum of the produced particle and @xmath34 is an extra introduced deformation parameter .",
    "this is equivalent to randomly re - sample @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the produced particle according to @xmath35 as the equation of ellipse @xmath36 is held , where the half major and minor axes are given by eq .",
    "( [ axi ] ) . in the eq .",
    "( [ axi1 ] ) @xmath37 is randomly distributed in [ 0 , 2@xmath38 .",
    "then we may fit the deformation parameter @xmath39 to the ( alice ) sphericity data and make prediction for other observables such as the elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 , or vice versa .    as the particle transverse momentum may be change in the rearrangement",
    ", one has to re - calculate the transverse momentum by @xmath40 after the rearrangement .",
    "however we will see later that provided @xmath39 is far less than unity ( small perturbation ) the change in particle transverse momentum distribution caused by the rearrangement is not visual .",
    "the fitting process could be started from the small @xmath39 side , @xmath41 for instance .",
    "if the calculated @xmath28 is larger than the alice data we increase the @xmath39 value and repeat the calculation , vice versa otherwise . at last , we obtain the results ( red curves indicated pythia6_1 in fig .",
    "[ spheri_2 ] ) calculated with @xmath39=0.092 and 0.091 , consistent well with the alice data of @xmath28 in the minimum bias pp collisions at @xmath42= 0.9 and 7 tev , respectively .",
    "the fourier expansion is another method investigating the particle transverse momentum azimuthal asymmetry @xcite . in @xcite the fourier expansion of the particle number ( multiplicity ) distribution",

    "frame , then the reaction plane is just the @xmath46 plane @xcite .",
    "therefore the reaction plane angle , @xmath44 , between the reaction plane and @xmath0 axis @xcite introduced for the extracting elliptic flow experimentally @xcite is zero .",
    "the equation ( [ f1 ] ) and the harmonic coefficients there reduce to @xmath47 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle v_n\\rangle_p=&\\langle cos(n\\phi)\\rangle_p , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle v_1\\rangle_p=&\\langle\\frac{p_x}{p_t}\\rangle_p , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle v_2\\rangle_p=&\\langle\\frac{p_x^2-p_y^2}{p_t^2}\\rangle_p , \\nonumber\\\\   . . .",

    "the second harmonic coefficient ( elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 ) is specially important because the large @xmath5 of emitted particles is a characteristic feature of the hot and dense medium created in the ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "it has contributed to the suggestion of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) observed in the nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "there are a number of predictions for the elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 in high energy ( multiplicity ) pp collisions @xcite .",
    "we pursue having a prediction based on the experiments , the sphericity measurements @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sphecc ]    the predictions of the above pythia6_1 simulations are given in fig .",

    "table  [ sphecc ] gives the upper limit of the charged particle elliptic flow parameter @xmath5 obtained by averaging @xmath50 over @xmath33 .",
    "it is found in the table that the @xmath5 upper limits are estimated as 0.2 - 0.3 for minimum bias pp collisions at the lhc energies , which is consistent with the existing results of 0.04 - 0.2 in @xcite .",
    "we also see in the table that the @xmath5 upper limit decreases with increasing the reaction energy .",
    "this is consistent with the alice results that the charged particle event averaged transverse sphericity increases from 0.613 at 0.9 tev to 0.700 at 7 tev .    to check how the momentum rearrangement defined in eq .",

    "it is found that the results of pythia6 and pythia6_1 are so close that one may conclude that provided the deformation parameter @xmath39 is far less than unity ( small perturbation ) the change in transverse momentum distribution caused by the rearrangement is trivial .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a method of randomly rearranging the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of produced particle from the pythia6.4 simulation on the circumference of an ellipse with the half major and minor axes being @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the charged particle transverse momentum sphericity and the elliptic flow parameter in the minimum bias pp collisions at @xmath42=0.9 and 7 tev are then calculated systematically .",
    "the alice data of event averaged charged particle transverse sphericity as a function of charged multiplicity in the above pp collisions are well reproduced .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter as a function of @xmath51 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath50 ) as well as the @xmath5 upper limits of @xmath6 0.2 - 0.3 obtained by averaging @xmath50 over @xmath33 are predicted for the minimum bias pp collisions at the lhc energies .    as mentioned in @xcite that the charged particle transverse momentum sphericity is measured ( defined )  using jets to represent the final state four - momentum . \"",
    "this measurement is only influenced by the jet reconstruction .",
    "however , the measurement of @xmath5 , whatever the event plane method @xcite or the lee - yang zero point method @xcite or the cumulant method @xcite , is much more model dependence , such as the dependence on the model selected for the nonflow decomposition @xcite . the cumulant method is even distinguished by two- , four- , and six - particle cumulants .",
    "so the discrepancy among the measured @xmath5 values with the different methods may reach 10 - 100% @xcite .",
    "recently , one even argued that the event plane method is obsolete @xcite .",
    "therefore , we strongly suggest that the transverse momentum sphericity and the elliptic flow parameter should be measured simultaneously for the benefit of cross checking and the reliable measurements .",
