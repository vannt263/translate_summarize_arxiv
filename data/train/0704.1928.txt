    "another difference , which we shall show in section [ results ] , is that in 2d vorticity structures decrease in scale as @xmath6 increases while in 3d there is a change in aspect ratio with structures getting both shorter and fatter .",
    "this may , in fact , be related to the shallower lans@xmath1 energy spectrum for @xmath100 which we show in section [ results ] . while differences are observed between the scaling shown in fig .",

    "these `` rigid bodies '' follow as well from the consideration of lans@xmath1 as an initial value problem in fourier space , for which we have @xmath49 . in the limit as @xmath6 approaches infinity , all wavenumber ( and spatial ) dependence for @xmath116 is eliminated and the entire flow is advected by a uniform velocity field ( advection without internal degrees of freedom ) .    for a rigid body there can be no stretching and , therefore , all the longitudinal velocity increments , @xmath117 , must be identically zero ( @xmath118 from basic mechanics with @xmath119 the rotation vector and , hence , @xmath120 ) .",

    "( [ eq : lanssc ] ) the @xmath121 term contributes only a rotation and not a stretching of @xmath95 .",
    "such polymerization would have two consequences .",

    "indeed , equipartition of the energy among all modes in a truncated euler@xmath1 system should also lead to a @xmath129 spectrum .",
    "along with several experiments with different viscosities and also with statistically homogeneous and isotropic forcing ( not shown here ) , these are assurances that the observed spectrum is not a result of inadequate numerical resolution .",

    "les attempt at capturing the large - scale properties of a flow with a huge reynolds number , as found , e.g. , in the atmosphere . in that case , the wavenumber at which the dns is truncated is , at best , in the inertial range and it might even be in the energy - containing range , as for the atmospheric boundary layer with a taylor reynolds number @xmath194 . of a different nature",
    "are the modeling methods sometimes called quasi - dns . here , the idea is to model a flow at a given , moderate reynolds number but with an expense in computing resources lesser than if performing a dns .",
    "under - resolved dns fall in that category ; in that case , the large - scales are presumably well reproduced but the small scales are noisy .",
    "it is in that spirit that we now examine the properties of the lans@xmath1 model .",
    "we thus qualify a model as optimal in the sense of being optimal for the class of lans@xmath1 models examined herein ; in order to avoid repetition , we also use the terminology of alpha - optimal .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:512_les ] with @xmath195 , we plot the @xmath182 dns spectrum ( solid black line ) and lans@xmath1 spectra at three different resolutions .",

    "we see that for a given filter or a given simulation resolution , there is a local minimum in the error .",

    "( [ eq : navier - stokes ] ) , but the question we address now is how small must @xmath6 be for lans@xmath1 solutions to be good approximations to navier - stokes solutions .",

    "[ fig : error1 ] . while the general trend of errors decreasing with @xmath6 is apparent in all cases , in fig .",

    "[ fig : error1](b ) the errors are plotted versus the ratio of the dissipation scale , @xmath209 , to @xmath6 .",
    "we see a very strong dependence ( @xmath213 ) between errors for several runs with four different reynolds numbers indicating that the quality of the lans@xmath1 les approximation is a function of the ratio of @xmath6 to the dissipative scale . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : error1](c ) the errors are plotted versus the ratio of the taylor scale , @xmath208 , to @xmath6 .",
    "we find @xmath214 for a linear least - squares fit .",
    "we note that a single experiment conducted at @xmath215 ( the asterisks ) confirms that the maximal value of @xmath6 is tied to the dissipation scale and not the taylor scale .",
    "this is more clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : error2 ] where we plot compensated energy spectra for a nearly constant ratio @xmath216 at three reynolds numbers .",
    "we see that the maximum deviation from the dns spectrum increases with @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath216 is the same in all cases , the optimal @xmath6 is not dependent on the taylor scale .",
    "these findings were not accessible at lower reynolds numbers due to inadequate separation of scales .",
    "for example , we give in fig . [",
    "fig : flux](a ) spectral flux for dns at @xmath19 , @xmath164 , and @xmath166 respectively .",
    "we define the kinetic energy transfer function , @xmath217 , in fourier space as @xmath218 , where @xmath219 represents the fourier transform .",
    "for lans@xmath1 we have @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "the flux is defined as usual from the transfer function as @xmath222 only @xmath31 ( and @xmath215 not pictured here ) demonstrates a range of nearly constant flux ( a well - defined inertial range ) before the dissipation scales . following the scaling arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite , one effect of the @xmath0model is to increase the time scale for the cascade of energy to small scales .",
    "this reduces the flux as @xmath6 increases ( @xmath162 decreases ) as do the hypothesized `` rigid bodies ; '' this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux](b ) .",

    "there is a corresponding decrease of energy at large scales .",
    "consequently , as the inertial range increases , @xmath6 must be moved to smaller and smaller scales in order for lans@xmath1 not to alter scales larger than @xmath6 . in summary ,",
    "the @xmath0model s reduced flux of energy to small scales is more crucial when the dissipation scale is farther away from @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 must be directly proportional to the kolmogorov dissipation scale , we can estimate the les computational savings of the lans@xmath1 model .",

    "but , to obtain an optimal les , @xmath6 is tied to @xmath226 ; then the resolution requirements ( @xmath230 ) are different and the decrease in necessary computational resolution from employing lans@xmath1 is fixed .",
    "in fact , for the forcing and boundary conditions employed , we find @xmath231 we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nogain ] ) is consistent with theoretical predictions given in ref .",
    "other les such as the similarity model @xcite and the nonlinear ( or gradient ) model @xcite have also exhibited the characteristic that they achieve only moderate reductions in resolution and are , therefore , frequently used in mixed models with a smagorinsky term ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "that such additional terms will be required for lans@xmath1 to reproduce the energy spectrum of high @xmath9 flows , may not be a significant factor in its usability .",
    "note that the usual addition of extra dissipative subgrid - stress terms ( as in the smagorinsky model ) also introduces a stronger dependence of the system of equations with the spatial resolution , since the filter width in such models is often associated to the maximum wavenumber in the box , @xmath232 . in that case",
    ", it can make more sense to use grid - dependent solutions of lans@xmath1 ( discussed at the beginning of section [ les ] ) which give an optimal lans@xmath1 les , and can as a result give an extra gain in the computational costs .",

    "note however that a factor of @xmath233 in resolution gain translates into a factor 27 in cpu and a factor 12 in memory savings , still a substantial gain .",

    "the turbulent energy cascade occurs in the space between these `` rigid '' portions .",
    "while the @xmath5 portions are subdominant to the @xmath136 portions in the energy spectrum , they prevail in the cascade and hence both the structure functions and the degrees of freedom of the lans@xmath1 attractor .",

    "this leads to a shallower ( or even growing ) energy spectrum as @xmath6 increases .",
    "thus , for lans@xmath1 viewed as an les to reproduce the navier - stokes energy spectrum it is necessary that @xmath6 be not much larger than the dissipation scale ( @xmath262 independent of reynolds number ) ; in that sense , it can be considered as a quasi - dns as opposed to a traditional les , substantially larger reynolds numbers being modeled in the latter case , leading to substantially larger gain in resolution . as a consequence ,",

    "therefore , in 2d lans@xmath1 ( where the vorticity structures are more fine than navier - stokes ) the spectrum is steeper @xcite and in 3d lans@xmath1 ( where the vorticity structures are shorter but fatter than navier - stokes ) the spectrum is shallower . finally , an examination of the longitudinal structure functions indicate that intermittency is increased as the parameter @xmath6 is increased consistent with the suppression of local small - scale interactions at scales smaller than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the elimination of the faster and faster interactions among smaller and smaller scales through the modified nonlinearity in lans@xmath1 ( together with the discrepancy between its solutions and navier - stokes solutions ) highlights the importance of these interactions down to scales only slightly larger than the dissipative scale .",
    "that is , by removing these interactions anywhere in the inertial range ( e.g. , @xmath264 ) , the resulting energy spectrum was found to differ from the dns at scales larger than @xmath6 .",
