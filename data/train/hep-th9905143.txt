    "after the advent of d - branes @xcite there has been a renewed interest in the study of supergravity black @xmath8-branes , in particular those preserving a fraction of the original supersymmetry .",
    "this is due to their identification with the bps saturated non  perturbative states of superstring theory @xcite which has promoted them from classical solutions of the low  energy theory to solutions of the whole quantum theory .",
    "therefore they represent an important tool in probing the non  perturbative regime of superstring theories .",
    "of particular interest are the regular ones , namely those having a non  vanishing bekenstein  hawking entropy .",
    "in this paper we deal with bps static black hole solutions of @xmath9 supergravity preserving 1/8 of the original @xmath0 supersymmetry , completing a program started in @xcite and continued in @xcite .",
    "let us recall that in the context of toroidally compactified type ii supergravity the only regular black hole solutions are the 1/8 supersymmetry preserving ones .",
    "the 1/2 and 1/4 black holes , whose general form has been completely classified in @xcite , have a vanishing horizon area . more precisely , the only 4dimensional _ regular _ black hole configurations are those preserving 4 supersymmetry charges , irrespectively of their higher dimensional origin .",
    "one of the results of @xcite was to show that the most general @xmath10 black hole solution of @xmath0 supergravity can be related , through a @xmath4duality transformation , to a solution of a suitable consistent truncation @xmath11 of the supergravity theory ( corresponding to a calabi - yau compactification ) .",
    "@xmath4duality in supergravity denotes the largest global symmetry of the field equations and bianchi identities .",
    "we shall recall the main facts about @xmath4duality orbits of bps black holes in section 2 and it will be shown that the problem of studying the most general @xmath10 bps black hole in the @xmath0 theory can be reduced to that of finding the so called _ generating solution _ , that is the most general one modulo @xmath4duality transformations , which is a solution of the simpler @xmath1 truncation .",
    "once this solution is found , acting on it with the maximal compact subgroup @xmath12 of the @xmath4duality group one generates the general charged black hole and then acting with the whole @xmath4duality group @xmath13 one generates the most general solution , namely that with fully general asymptotic values of the scalar fields . in order to define the action of the @xmath0 @xmath4duality group on a solution of the aforementioned @xmath1 truncation , the embedding of the latter in the @xmath0 theory has to be defined in a precise group theoretical fashion .",
    "this was done in @xcite and @xcite using the solvable lie algebra formalism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 truncation mentioned above is called the @xmath2 model ( first studied in @xcite ) and essentially is a @xmath1 supergravity coupled to 3 vector multiplets interacting through the special khler manifold @xmath14 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "it has therefore @xmath15 real scalars ( 3 dilaton  like and 3 axion  like ) and four vector fields .",
    "a generic static , spherically symmetric black hole solution of this model is then characterized by @xmath16 electric ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath16 magnetic ( @xmath18 ) quantized charges and a point @xmath19 in the scalar manifold representing the asymptotic behavior of the scalar fields at infinite radial distance from the center of the solution",
    ". the generating solution is obtained by fixing the @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] duality action on a generic bps black hole solution , which is achieved by first choosing a particular point @xmath19 of the scalar manifold and then fixing the action of the isotropy group @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] on the solution , which amounts to imposing three suitable conditions on the quantized charges . these conditions in turn allow for three conditions on the evolving scalar fields of the solution , compatible with the field equations and the bps requirement .",
    "the generating solution therefore will be described by @xmath22 charges and three independent scalars .",
    "the mathematical framework in which to construct such a solution has been defined in @xcite , however an explicit solution was given only in a simplified case where the 3 dilatons @xmath23 and the 3 axions @xmath24 were separately set equal to a single dilaton field @xmath25 and a single axion field @xmath26 .",
    "this solution , if properly gauge  fixed , would depend only on @xmath27 parameters .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to relax these restrictions and compute the @xmath22parameter generating solution within the @xmath2 model .",
    "other regular solutions of the same theory , different from the generating one , have been considered in other papers @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , the generating solution represents a pure ns ",
    "ns black hole , that is a black hole whose 10 dimensional microscopic configuration is made only of ns branes .",
    "indeed , the generating solution for black holes of the toroidally compactified type ii string theory is the same as the one of the toroidally compactified heterotic string and it was already constructed in @xcite .",
    "our point is that , as noticed in @xcite , as far as the microscopic entropy counting is concerned it is difficult to count the states of a pure ns ",
    "ns configuration .",
    "therefore it is essential to be able to reproduce r ",
    "r configurations which are those represented in terms of intersecting d  branes only .",
    "this in principle would not be a problem since @xmath4duality does not make any difference between r ",
    "r and ns  ns fields and one should be able to move from a solution to any other acting via @xmath4duality transformations .",
    "however , as previously pointed out , in order for this to be possible one has not only to build up the generating solution itself but also to know how the latter is embedded in the full theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section 2 we describe the structure of the @xmath4duality orbits for @xmath10 bps black holes in terms of @xmath22 independent invariants and characterize the generating solution as a solution depending on @xmath22 independent charge parameters , in terms of which the @xmath22 invariants can be expressed as independent functions on the chosen point of the moduli space at infinity .    in section 3",
    "we explicitly construct the 5 parameters generating solution by solving both the first and second order differential equations , after performing the aforementioned @xmath28 parameter gauge fixing .",
    "the need to check that a particular solution of the first order equations representing the bps condition fulfill the second order field equations as well is due to a known feature of solitonic solutions in supergravity that the former equations in general do nt imply the latter .",
    "most of the technical aspects concerning both the derivation of the first and second order differential equations ( the former representing the bps conditions , the latter being the equations of motion ) and the proper formalism needed in order to embed the @xmath2 model solution in the @xmath0 theory properly , have already been given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hence we shall skip most technical details and make use of the results already obtained in @xcite .",
    "we end in section 4 with few comments and some concluding remarks .",
    "let us recall the main facts about the @xmath4duality orbits of 1/8 bps black holes in the @xmath0 classical supergravity theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the equations of motion and the bianchi identities of the @xmath0 classical supergravity theory in 4dimensions are invariant with respect to the @xmath4duality group @xmath29 .",
    "this invariance requires the group @xmath29 to act simultaneously on both the 70 scalar fields @xmath30 spanning the manifold @xmath31 and on the vector @xmath32 consisting of the 28 electric and 28 magnetic quantized charges .",
    "the @xmath4duality group acts on the scalar fields as the isometry group of @xmath33 and on @xmath32 in the @xmath34 ( symplectic ) representation .",
    "a static , spherically symmetric bps black hole solution is characterized in general by the vector @xmath35 and a particular point @xmath19 on the moduli space of the theory whose @xmath36 coordinates @xmath37 are the values of the scalar fields at infinity ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "acting on a black hole solution ( @xmath39 ) by means of a @xmath4duality transformation @xmath40 one generates a new black hole solution ( @xmath41 ) : @xmath42 the bps black hole solutions fill therefore @xmath4duality orbits .",
    "as far as the @xmath10 bps black holes are concerned these orbits turn out to be parameterized by @xmath22 functions @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) which are invariant under the duality transformations in ( [ uduality ] ) .",
    "these invariants are expressed in terms of the @xmath45 anti  symmetric central charge matrix @xmath46 ( the antisymmetric couple @xmath47 , as @xmath48 and @xmath49 run from 1 to 8 , labels the representation @xmath50 of @xmath51 ) in the following way ( @xcite ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the matrix @xmath54 and the convention @xmath55 is adopted . among the @xmath56 a particular role is played by the _ moduli  independent _ invariant @xmath57 that is the _ quartic invariant _",
    "( which will be denoted in the sequel also by @xmath58 in order to refer to its group theoretical meaning ) of @xmath29 whose value is related to the entropy of the black hole @xcite,@xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , @xmath59 must be non  negative in order for the solution to be bps ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath57 the inequivalent orbits are parameterized by the remaining four invariants @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the behavior of the scalars describing the regular solutions with fixed entropy is schematically represented in figure @xmath63 in which the scalar fields flow from their boundary values @xmath19 at infinity which span @xmath64 ( the disk ) to their fixed values @xmath65 at the horizon @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "it should be understood , of course , that the @xmath67 axis is a @xmath68dimensional space , where @xmath68 is the dimension of @xmath64 .",
    "the invariants @xmath56 turn out to be independent functions of the quantized charges in any generic point @xmath19 of the moduli  space except for some `` singular '' points where the number of truly independent invariants could be less than five .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the point @xmath69 parameterized by the fixed values of the scalar fields at the horizon . in this point",
    "the _ only _ independent invariant is the moduli ",
    "independent one , @xmath70 .",
    "we will come back on this at the end of this section .",
    "epsf    the generating solution may be characterized as the solution depending on the the minimal number of parameters sufficient to obtain all possible @xmath22plets of values for the @xmath22 invariants on a particular point @xmath71 of the moduli ",
    "space ( a possible vacuum of the theory ) . from the above characterization",
    "it follows that the whole @xmath4duality orbits of @xmath10 bps black hole solutions may be constructed by acting by means of @xmath29 transformations ( [ uduality ] ) on the generating one .",
    "in particular , if we focus on @xmath10 bps black hole solutions having a fixed value of the entropy ( proportional to the square root of @xmath72 ) and on a particular bosonic vacuum for the theory specified by a point @xmath19 in the moduli  space , by acting only on the charges of the generating solution with the @xmath4duality group , it would be possible to construct the whole spectrum of @xmath10 bps solutions of the theory realized in the chosen vacuum @xmath19 ( see figure 2 ) . since in a particular point",
    "@xmath73 on @xmath64 the minimum number of parameters a solution should depend on in order to reproduce all the @xmath22plets of values for the independent invariants is obviously five , we expect the charge vector @xmath32 of the generating solution @xmath74 to depend on five independent charges .",
    "epsf    in order to motivate , in brief , the result obtained in @xcite according to which the generating solution for @xmath10 bps black holes in the @xmath0 theory is described within a suitable @xmath1 truncation of the theory ( the @xmath2 model ) , let us notice that the @xmath22 quantities in eq .",
    "( [ inv5 ] ) are invariant with respect to the action of @xmath51 on @xmath75 . in particular , by means of a @xmath76parameter @xmath51 transformation , the central charge matrix can be brought to its _ normal form _ in which it is skew ",
    "symmetrized with complex eigenvalues @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . as a consequence of this rotation ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed discussion ) the central charge eigenvalues end up depending on just @xmath15 ( dynamical ) scalar fields and @xmath80 quantized charges which characterize the solutions of an @xmath2 model suitably embedded in the original theory . within this truncation , the @xmath15 scalar fields ( @xmath28 dilatons @xmath23 and @xmath28 axions @xmath24 ) belong to @xmath28 vector multiplets and span a manifold @xmath81 ^ 3 $ ] , while the @xmath16 electric charges @xmath17 and @xmath16 magnetic charges @xmath18 ( @xmath82 ) transform in the @xmath83 of @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] . in the framework of the @xmath2 model , the central charge eigenvalues @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) are , respectively , the local realization on moduli space @xmath87 of the @xmath1 supersymmetry algebra central charge @xmath88 and of the @xmath28 _ matter _ central charges associated with the @xmath28 matter vector fields ( which are related to the central charge via the following relation : @xmath89 , @xmath90 being the khler metric on @xmath87 and @xmath91 ) . on the @xmath10 bps",
    "black hole solutions these four eigenvalues are in general independent in a generic point of the moduli  space and the bps condition reads : @xmath92 since the @xmath51 transformation used to define the @xmath2 truncation of the original theory did not affect the values of the @xmath22 invariants in eq .",
    "( [ inv5 ] ) , the latter are expected to assume all possible @xmath22plets of values on bps solutions of this theory . from this",
    "we conclude that _ the generating solution for @xmath10 bps black holes in the @xmath0 theory is a solution of the @xmath2 truncation as well . _    in the framework of the @xmath2 model the five invariants in eq .",
    "( [ inv5 ] ) are rewritten in the following form : @xmath93 however in this model there is still a residual invariance of the above quantities represented by the @xmath28 parameter group @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] , isotropy group of the scalar manifold @xmath87 and subgroup of @xmath51 .",
    "it acts on the four phases @xmath94 of the central charge eigenvalues @xmath95 leaving the overall phase @xmath96 invariant .",
    "the generating solution is obtained by fixing this gauge freedom and therefore it depends , consistently with what stated above , on @xmath22 parameters represented by the four norms of the central charge eigenvalues @xmath97 plus the overall phase @xmath98 .",
    "these quantities are @xmath4duality invariants as well .",
    "it can be shown indeed that the norms @xmath97 may be expressed in terms of the four invariants @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) while the overall phase is contained in the expression of the pfaffian in @xmath101 and thus is an invariant quantity as well which is expressed in terms of all the five @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , see eq.s ( [ inv5 ] ) and ( [ invstu ] ) : @xmath103 the moduli independent invariant @xmath70 , computed in the @xmath2 model , is the quartic invariant of the @xmath83 of @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] and it is useful to express it in a form which is intrinsic to this representation .",
    "we may indeed represent the vector @xmath104 as a tensor @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the indices of the @xmath107 of each @xmath108 factor .",
    "the invariants are constructed by contracting the indices of an even number @xmath109 of @xmath105 with @xmath110 invariant matrices @xmath111 .",
    "this contraction gives zero for @xmath112 odd while for @xmath112 even one finds : @xmath113 it can be shown rigorously that the quartic invariant written above is the _ only _ independent invariant of this representation , that is any other invariant may be expressed as powers of it .",
    "the square root of @xmath59 is proportional to the entropy of the solution and its expression is consistent with the result of @xcite . in terms of the @xmath80",
    "quantized charges the components of @xmath105 are : @xmath114    according to the above characterization of the generating solution , it is apparent therefore that the black hole found in @xcite represents just a particular ( regular ) solution characterized by just @xmath27 invariant parameters ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) , although depending on three charges .",
    "that solution was obtained by setting @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , acting on it by means of an @xmath4duality transformation , it is clear from our previous discussion that it would be possible to span only a @xmath27parameter sub  orbit of the whole @xmath4duality orbit .",
    "the same argument holds for all the regular @xmath10 bps black holes characterized by less than @xmath22 independent invariant parameters , in particular for the double fixed solution found in @xcite .",
    "this is in fact a very particular solution in which the scalar fields do not evolve and their values at infinity coincide with their fixed ones at the horizon @xmath69 . at this point",
    "the matter central charges vanish ( @xmath121 , @xmath86 ) and the central charge @xmath122 becomes proportional to @xmath123 which represents therefore the only invariant parameter characterizing the spectrum of @xmath10 bps solutions on this particular point of the moduli  space .",
    "the @xmath22plet of invariants @xmath124 on this solution have the specific simple form @xmath125 , @xmath26 being a constant depending on the @xmath80 charges and proportional to the entropy .",
    "summarizing , the three main facts reviewed in the present section are :    * the @xmath4duality orbits of @xmath10 bps black hole solutions are characterized by five @xmath4duality invariants @xmath102 .",
    "*   the generating solution @xmath126 is characterized by a generic point on the moduli space at infinity @xmath127 ( in which the five invariants are actually independent functions of the charges @xmath35 ) and by five independent charge parameters @xmath35 such that , by varying the latter one obtains all possible combinations of values of @xmath102 consistent with the bps condition ( @xmath128 ) . * the generating solution of 1/8 susy preserving black holes of @xmath0 supergravity can be thought of as a 1/2 preserving solution of an @xmath2 model suitably embedded in the original theory @xcite . in this framework , which is that we will deal with , the five invariants @xmath102 can be expressed as proper combinations of the norms of the four central charges @xmath129 ( the supersymmetry and the three matter ones corresponding to @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively ) and their overall phase @xmath98 , according to eqs .",
    "( [ invstu ] ) and ( [ pf ] ) .",
    "in the present section we shall compute the @xmath22parameter generating solution as a @xmath132 bps black hole solution of the @xmath2 model .    the property a bps saturated state has of preserving a fraction of the original supersymmetries can be characterized , on a bosonic background , by requiring that the supersymmetry transformations of all the fermion fields vanish along a suitable direction in the supersymmetry parameter space ( killing spinor ) : @xmath133 the first of these equations is equivalent to a system of first order differential equations on the background fields .",
    "in particular the system of equations in the scalar fields has a fixed point , which will be denoted by @xmath134 , towards which the solution @xmath135 flows to at the horizon @xmath136 @xcite .    the way eq .",
    "( [ killing ] ) has been written expresses the reality condition for @xmath137 and it amounts to fix one of the three @xmath138 gauge symmetries of @xmath139 already giving therefore a condition on the @xmath80 charges and the scalar fields . in general however , as pointed out in @xcite , one should in fact consider a more general form for the killing spinor condition , namely : @xmath140 and , as noticed by g. moore , imposing the reality of the central charge could in principle imply that some topologically non  trivial solutions are disregarded .",
    "nevertheless studying such a special class of solutions is not among the purposes of our present investigation and therefore we shall choose the supersymmetry central charge to be real ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "let us consider the gauge fixing procedure in detail .",
    "the four central charges @xmath142 of the @xmath2 model , depending on the asymptotic values of the six scalars @xmath143 and @xmath80 charges @xmath104 , transform under @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] duality ( [ uduality ] ) as follows : @xmath144 ^ 3&&z_k(\\phi^g,\\vec{q}^g)\\,=\\,h_g\\cdot z_k(\\phi,\\vec{q})\\nonumber\\\\ h_g\\in so(2)^3 & & h_g\\cdot z_k\\equiv e^{{\\rm i}\\delta_k^g}z_k \\label{phases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence an @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] duality transformation on the moduli at infinity and on the quantized charges amounts to an @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] phase transformation on the four central charges .",
    "this holds true in particular if we consider @xmath145 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "it follows that the @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] gauge fixing may be achieved by either imposing three suitable conditions on the phases of the central charges , or alternatively fixing the @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] action on @xmath35 on a chosen point @xmath146 of the moduli space at infinity",
    ". we shall pursue the latter way which amounts to impose three suitable conditions on the quantized charges .",
    "these conditions will not be derived with group theoretical arguments ; it will suffice , as it has been pointed out in the last section , to show that the five invariants , computed in @xmath147 , are independent functions of the remaining five charges .",
    "since , on one hand , the two  fold action of a duality transformation ( and in particular of a @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] transformation ) on both the quantized charges and the scalar fields is an invariance of the equations of motion , and on the other hand the charges @xmath35 are `` constants of motion '' ( with respect to the @xmath148evolution ) , we expect that _ the three gauge fixing conditions on the electric and magnetic charges have a counterpart in three @xmath148independent conditions on the fields @xmath149 , such that the restricted system of scalar fields and vector fields is still a solution of the field equations .",
    "_ after the gauge fixing procedure therefore we would expect the solution to be described by five independent charges , three real scalar fields and the metric function @xmath150 .",
    "the evolution of the latter four fields will be described in terms of four different harmonic functions .",
    "let us now recall the main positions on the background fields used to derive the first order equations from equation ( [ killing ] ) .",
    "the first of eqs .",
    "( [ killing ] ) can be specialized to the supersymmetry transformations of the gravitino and gaugino within the @xmath2 model in the following way : @xmath151 where @xmath86 labels the three matter vector fields , @xmath152 are the @xmath153 r - symmetry indices and @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the graviphoton and matter field strengths respectively ( the @xmath156 sign stands for the anti  self dual part ) . according to the procedure defined in @xcite , we adopt the following anstze for the vector fields : @xmath157 where @xmath158 the moduli  independent quantized charges @xmath159 and the moduli  dependent electric charges @xmath160 @xcite are obtained by the following integrations : @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 denote the spheres centered in @xmath66 of radius @xmath148 and @xmath164 respectively .",

    "( [ newkill ] ) , after some algebra , one obtains an equivalent system of first order differential equations on the background fields of the form : @xmath170 where the supersymmetry central charge",
    "@xmath171 has the following expression : @xmath172 the vector @xmath173 is the covariantly holomorphic section on the symplectic bundle defined on the special khler manifold @xmath87 .",
    "as already stressed , in order to find a proper solution we need also the equations of motion that must be satisfied together with the first order ones .",
    "the former can be derived from an @xmath1 pure supergravity action coupled to 3 vector multiplets ( see @xcite for notation ) : @xmath174+h_{ij^\\star}(z,\\bar z)\\partial_\\mu z^i \\partial^\\mu \\bar{z}^{j^\\star } + \\left({\\rm im}{\\cal n}_{\\lambda\\sigma}f^{\\lambda}_{\\cdot\\cdot } f^{\\sigma\\vert\\cdot\\cdot}+{\\rm re } { \\cal n}_{\\lambda\\sigma}f^{\\lambda}_{\\cdot\\cdot}\\tilde{f}^{\\sigma\\vert\\cdot\\cdot}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it was shown in @xcite that the maxwell equations are automatically satisfied by the anstze ( [ strenghtsans ] ) .",

    "the equations for the independent axions @xmath207 may then be rewritten as follows : @xmath208 the solution of the above equations is : @xmath209 as far as the equation for @xmath25 is concerned , substituting the expressions of @xmath210 in @xmath211 one obtains an equation for @xmath212 which is easily solved by introducing a new harmonic function @xmath213 .",

    "eq.([alltogether ] ) , together with eq.s ( [ charcond])-([imz0 ] ) , represents our 5 parameter generating solution .",
    "let us consider now the _ near  horizon _ limit of the function @xmath220 : @xmath221 substituting this limit in the anstze for the metric ( [ fishlicense ] ) we obtain the known result that the near horizon geometry of a regular bps black hole is described by a bertotti ",

    "the functional expression of the generating solution obviously depends on the gauge fixing procedure adopted and , for computational convenience , in the present work we have fixed the @xmath21 ^ 3 $ ] gauge using a prescription which is different from that suggested in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have constructed the generating solution for bps saturated static black holes of @xmath0 supergravity ( that is either m  theory compactified on @xmath227 , or equivalently type ii string theory compactified on @xmath228 ) .",

    "there has been an intense study in giving the precise correspondence between macroscopic and microscopic black hole configurations in the last couple of years .",
    "this has been investigated both in the context of @xmath0 compactifications ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) and of @xmath1 compactifications ( see for example @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "however , all these solutions were somewhat particular under one circumstance or another .",
    "what we mean is that a precise and general recipe to give this correspondence for _ any _ macroscopic configuration is still lacking . on the contrary , if we know how to transform the generating solution into a generic one , in particular to those whose microscopic interpretation is known , then we can derive the microscopic stringy description of any geometric macroscopic solution . and this could shed light even on some still not understood aspects of black hole physics as , for example , the very conceptual basis of the microscopic entropy counting ( for recent work in this direction see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "while most of the group theoretical machinery necessary in order to make the embedding has been already constructed in @xcite , it is our aim , in a forthcoming paper , to give some explicit examples of the use of @xmath4duality transformations in moving from a given solution to other ones @xcite .",
    "for example , one could find the macroscopic description corresponding to the five parameter r ",
