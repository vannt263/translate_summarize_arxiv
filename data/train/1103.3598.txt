    "we theoretically analyze a hybrid superconducting interferometer which exploits the phase dependence of the density of states ( dos ) of a proximized metallic nanowire to achieve high sensitivity to magnetic flux . the operation of a prototype structure based on this principle , the squipt @xcite , has been recently reported .",
    "we show that with a careful design transfer functions as large as a few mv@xmath0 and intrinsic flux noise @xmath3 can be achieved below 1 k. limited dissipation joined with the opportunity to access single - spin detection make this structure attractive for the investigation of the switching dynamics of individual magnetic nanoparticles .",
