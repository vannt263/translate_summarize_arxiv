    "rayleigh s criterion for resolution of two incoherent point sources , which asserts that a minimum separation between the sources equal to the diffraction - limited spot size is necessary for them to be resolvable , has perhaps been the most influential resolution criterion in the history of optics despite its heuristic character @xcite . based as it is on the eye as a detection instrument , rayleigh s criterion neglects the possibility of better resolution using light of greater intensity or using a longer observation period .",
    "pioneering studies on resolution limits as a function both of the source separation and the mean number of observed photons were made by bettens _",
    "et al . _ in @xcite and more recently by ram _",
    "_ in @xcite ( see also @xcite in the context of electron microscopy ) . in @xcite , it was shown that for a given mean photon number , ideal continuum image - plane photon counting can locate the centroid , i.e. , the midpoint , of the two radiating sources with a finite precision ( depending on the size of the diffraction - limited spot in the image plane and on the number of photons detected ) no matter how small their separation is .",
    "based on the cramr - rao ( cr ) lower bound of estimation theory @xcite , it was also shown in @xcite that any ( unbiased ) estimate of the separation between the sources based on image - plane photon counting must suffer a divergent mean squared error for a given mean photon number as the separation tends to zero .",
    "this phenomenon was dubbed _",
    "rayleigh s curse _ in @xcite as it suggests a fundamental limitation in resolving incoherent point sources even when the role of the average detected photon number is taken into account . in the past few decades , several far - field super - resolution techniques that circumvent the rayleigh limit",
    "have revolutionized microscopy ( see @xcite for a review ) , but these rely on placing restrictions on the emissions from the sources and do not fundamentally challenge the criterion ( or rayleigh s curse ) for independently and incoherently radiating sources .",
    "other developments , e.g.,@xcite , use clever techniques to approach the performance of ideal continuum image - plane photon counting using imperfect detectors .    in @xcite , following preliminary work in @xcite , the problem of resolving two incoherent point sources",
    "was approached anew from the perspective of quantum estimation theory using the quantum cramr - rao ( qcr ) bound @xcite .",
    "this bound provides a fundamental limit to the accuracy of estimating the source separation optimized over all possible measurement techniques allowed by quantum mechanics . under a weak - source assumption , it was found in @xcite that the qcr lower bound on the minimum mean squared error ( mse ) of estimating the separation of two point sources is _ independent _ of that separation .",
    "further , a linear optics - based measurement  spatial - mode demultiplexing ( spade )  was proposed and shown in principle to approach the quantum bound for all values of the separation .",
    "these results are in stark contrast to the performance of image - plane photon counting mentioned above , as the divergent behavior of the minimum mse with decreasing separation ",
    "rayleigh s curse  is conspicuously absent .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the resolution problem from the point of view of the semiclassical theory of photodetection @xcite . for sources emitting thermal radiation , for linear propagation of light through the imaging system , and for linear - optics processing followed by photon counting , the semiclassical theory of photodetection may be used to obtain the same results as a fully quantum analysis would give @xcite .",
    "this is because the thermal state has a positive @xmath0-representation , and its counting statistics may be obtained by statistical averaging over those of coherent states via mandel s rule @xcite .",
    "the sliver scheme of this paper as well as the schemes of @xcite satisfy the above necessary conditions for the applicability of the semiclassical theory .",
    "we emphasize that , for the state of radiation and measurements considered here and in @xcite , `` semiclassical '' does not imply `` approximate ''  the fully quantum and semiclassical treatments are in quantitative agreement .",
    "besides its greater familiarity to the optics community , a semiclassical analysis of the resolution problem offers several advantages .",
    "firstly , the analysis can be carried out for arbitrary source strengths .",
    "indeed , the work in @xcite assumes the sources are weak enough so that the counting statistics are nearly poissonian .",
    "similarly , the quantum analysis in @xcite assumed , for mathematical tractability , that the sources are weak enough so that the state of light could be assumed to be confined to the zero and one - photon subspaces .",
    "thus , a semiclassical treatment will incorporate the effects of multi - photon events neglected in @xcite and in the quantum analysis of @xcite .",
    "such an analysis would also reveal whether the superresolution effect predicted in @xcite for weak sources persists as the source strength is increased .",
    "a second advantage of the semiclassical approach is that intuitions from semiclassical optics can be harnessed to both understand the reasons for superresolution as well as to design new measurement schemes which can also be analyzed semiclassically provided that they only involve linear optics and photodetection , possibly along with the use of other classical sources of light .",
    "accordingly , our contributions in this paper are three - fold:-    1 .",
    "we set up the problem of resolving two incoherently radiating point sources in the framework of semiclassical photodetection theory .",
    "the sources can be of arbitrary strength and imaging systems with two - dimensional circularly - symmetric point - spread functions are studied .",
    "the thermal source model is applicable to a wide range of physical scenarios ranging from optical astronomy to fluorescence microscopy .",
    "we propose a new interferometric scheme for estimating source separation that we call sliver ( super localization by image inversion interferometry ) and that yields finite resolution for arbitrarily small values of the source separation and for arbitrary source strengths .",
    "devices employing image inversion have been proposed , studied and demonstrated previously in the microscopy literature for various related applications @xcite , but the fundamental limits on the capability of such devices for improving lateral resolution seem not to have been explored before . through an analysis of the photodetection statistics of sliver in the semiclassical framework , we show both using the cramr - rao bound and through explicit simulation that our method manifestly alleviates rayleigh s curse .",
    "we offer an explanation for the superlocalization effect of sliver at small values of separation in the language of estimation theory applied to the photodetection statistics for thermal light .",
    "consider the depiction in fig .  1 of the focused image of two incoherent point sources in the image plane of an imaging system coordinatized by @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the imaging system is spatially invariant and coordinates have been rescaled so that the image is of unit magnification @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the ( possibly complex - valued ) normalized amplitude point - spread function ( psf ) @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 is circularly symmetric , so that @xmath2 depends only on the magnitude @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "it is straightforward to make @xmath2 spatially invariant and circularly symmetric in an imaging system using two lenses @xcite .",
    "the prototypical example of such a psf is of course the airy disk pattern resulting from a circular pupil .",
    "the images of the sources 1 and 2 in the image plane are assumed to be centered at @xmath6 respectively , giving rise in the image plane to a combined field with complex amplitude @xmath7 in normalized units of @xmath8 .",
    "we will assume throughout this paper , except in section 5.3 , that the centroid of the sources , i.e. , their midpoint , has already been located , perhaps by image - plane photon counting @xcite .",
    "it is taken to lie at the origin of the image plane . in sec .",
    "5.3 , we consider the effect of a small error in centroid localization .",
    "our initial results suggest that our measurement scheme is robust to such perturbations .",
    "the pair of dimensionless complex numbers @xmath9 are the source amplitudes .",
    "the thermal and mutually incoherent nature of the sources dictates that the source amplitudes are circular - complex gaussian random variables having the first and second moments @xcite:- @xmath10 =   0 \\label{s1}\\\\ & \\mathbb{e}[a_{\\mu}a_{\\nu } ] = 0 \\label{s2}\\\\ & \\mathbb{e}[a_{\\mu}^*a_{\\mu } ] = \\epsilon_\\mu \\label{s3 } \\\\ & \\mathbb{e}[a_{1}^*a_2 ] = 0 \\label{s4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath11 ranging over the two sources .",
    "according to the above relations , the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath12 comprise four statistically independent zero - mean gaussians of variance @xmath13 ( for the components of @xmath14 ) or @xmath15 ( for the components of @xmath16 ) .",
    "( [ s1])-([s4 ] ) are as appropriate for completely incoherent sources with respective strengths ( i.e. , mean photon number ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which can assume any values .     and @xmath19 located at the tail and tip respectively of the vector @xmath20 .",
    "the blue spots indicate the approximate extent of the point - spread function ( psf ) centered at each source .",
    "the centroid of the sources is assumed to coincide with the intersection @xmath21 of the optical axis with the image plane .",
    "the focus of this paper is the regime in which @xmath22 is smaller than the width of the psf , in which conventional image - plane photon counting performs poorly in estimating @xmath23 . ]    given that the centroid has been located , the parameter of interest is the separation @xmath24 between the two sources .",
    "the angle between the line joining the sources and the @xmath25-axis is another unknown parameter , but the measurement method proposed here works regardless of the value of that angle , which need not be known beforehand in practice .",
    "we will thus focus just on the separation @xmath23 and apply the tools of single - parameter estimation theory in our analysis .",
    "the sliver measurement , illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "2 and described in detail below , essentially involves the separation of the image - plane field @xmath26 of eq .   into its _",

    "the field components of eq .   may be obtained in spatially separated planes using an _ image inversion interferometer _ ( iii ) that works by splitting the input field using a 50 - 50 beamsplitter , spatially inverting the field from one output about the optical axis and recombining the two beams at a second 50 - 50 beamsplitter .",
    "the two beams output from the second beamsplitter then have the field patterns of eq .  .",
    "the entire setup is thus essentially a balanced mach - zehnder interferometer with an inversion device in one arm ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the critical element in such setups is the inversion device  a device that implements the transformation @xmath31 .",
    "inversion devices have been proposed and demonstrated for various applications in the fluorescence microscopy community and a considerable literature on image inversion microscopy exists @xcite .",

    "the spatial inversion itself can be accomplished in a variety of ways , e.g. , using a @xmath32-arrangement with lenses @xcite , with a 3-d setup using plane mirrors @xcite , or using two concave mirrors @xcite .",

    "figure 9 displays the simulated mses for the same source and system parameters , with @xmath133 and for the misalignment factor values @xmath134 and 0.4 .",
    "we see that the performance degrades gracefully with increasing misalignment , remains within an order of magnitude of the cr bound of the aligned system , and does not display the divergent behavior of image - plane photon counting @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of sliver under misalignment  including derivations of the formulas in this section , cramr - rao bounds , and performance analyses  will be given elsewhere .",

    "motivated by the greater familiarity and facility of analysis afforded by the semiclassical theory of photodetection over the full quantum theory , we have set up the problem of resolving two incoherently radiating point sources in this framework .",
    "this theory is quantitatively exact for such sources and for measurements involving only linear - optics processing prior to photodetection .",
    "the sources are assumed to be of arbitrary strength and circularly - symmetric psf s directly related to real imaging systems are considered . since the analysis in @xcite was largely confined to a one - dimensional model of the point - spread function with a weak - source assumption ,",
    "the model used here is of interest both theoretically and in practice ( see also the remarks in sec .  v therein ) .",
    "we have not made full semiclassical analyses of the binary spade and spade protocols of @xcite here , as these are rather involved and will be given elsewhere .",
    "preliminary calculations indicate that the results from @xcite for @xmath78 agree with those from the semiclassical analysis to @xmath135 .    we have also proposed and analyzed a novel interferometric scheme ",
    "the sliver method of sec .",
    "3  for estimating the separation between the sources once their centroid has been located .",
    "the scheme alleviates rayleigh s curse and provides superresolution at all values of source strengths .",
    "the essential ingredient of the scheme is an image inversion interferometer ( iii )  a device that separates the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the image - plane field relative to inversion about the centroid of the sources . the sliver method , unlike the binary spade and spade schemes , does not require coupling the image - plane field into one or more waveguides with mode profiles tailored to the psf of the imaging system .",
    "as such , it appears to be more readily implementable in practice .",
    "an explanation of the superlocalization effect of sliver for estimating @xmath80 may be given in terms of photon statistics as follows .",
    "if both sources were superimposed at the centroid ( so that @xmath77 ) , the field @xmath51 in the antisymmetric output port of the iii is identically zero despite their incoherence .",
    "if @xmath23 is small but nonzero , the mean photon number @xmath136 is finite but still small as per eq .  .",
    "the fisher information on the mean of a bose - einstein distribution equals @xmath137^{-1}$ ] and hence is very large in this region of @xmath23 .",
    "this extreme sensitivity to changes in @xmath23 is partially offset by the weak sensitivity of @xmath138 on @xmath23 via @xmath139 which is close to zero for @xmath80 ( cf . the term in square brackets in eq .  ) .",
    "these two effects compensate each other to give a finite value of the fisher information for separations close to zero . in the symmetric port ,",
    "on the other hand , the mean output is large at @xmath80 and the fisher information is correspondingly small , so that the second effect dominates and superlocalization is not obtained .",
    "similar remarks apply to on - off detection in the two output ports .",
    "it is rather remarkable that appropriate linear - optics processing followed by spatially - unresolved on - off detection can alleviate the divergent mse behavior plaguing ideal spatially - resolved image - plane photon counting for closely separated sources .",
    "somewhat intriguingly , receivers using the same toolkit of operations ( linear - optics processing with bulk on - off detection ) also approach the quantum limits of binary @xcite and @xmath48-ary @xcite communication with laser ( coherent - state ) light .    as mentioned in sec .  3 ,",
    "various imaging modalities employing image inversion have been proposed and demonstrated previously in the microscopy literature @xcite .",
    "the importance of the antisymmetric output of the iii for improving lateral resolution has also been noticed , e.g. , in @xcite . however , the claimed resolution enhancements in these works are in terms of the reduction of effective widths of the psf by fixed factors , which in turn are related to the intensity patterns at the two outputs of the iii ( or their difference ) .",
    "thus , from a statistical viewpoint , it appears that these works focus on the spatial structure of the first moment of the photocount random process ( i.e , the intensity ) at the two output channels of the interferometer and on the information about the separation @xmath23 extractable from it . in contrast , we have focused on spatially unresolved detection at the antisymmetric output port of the iii and on the cramr - rao bound as the fundamental limit to the mean squared error of any ( unbiased ) estimate of the separation . by considering statistically optimal estimators",
    ", we can exploit the information available in the full probability distribution of the measurement rather than just its first moment .",
    "such subtler estimators are necessitated by the limited number of photons that can be collected in most imaging applications .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator , which approaches the cramr - rao bound in the limit of large @xmath48 @xcite , was shown to yield performance in close agreement to the bound and sometimes exceeding it .    in order to focus on the spatial aspects of the resolution problem",
    ", we have , as in @xcite , suppressed the explicit temporal dependence of the field in our analysis . in effect",
    ", we have assumed that the light emitted by the sources is in a single quasimonochromatic temporal mode in each detection window .",
    "such a situation can be easily realized using a pseudothermal light source @xcite , but is in general unrealistic for many astronomical and biological imaging situations in which the coherence time of the emitted radiation is typically much shorter than the duration of the detection window .",
    "an approximate treatment of such cases can be given using the concept of the number of coherence cells @xcite .",
    "this approach effectively redefines the number of shots @xmath48 according to the coherence properties of the light , with exact results obtainable in certain cases .",
    "these issues will be explored in detail elsewhere .",
    "the effects of loss and non - unity quantum efficiency of the detectors can be incorporated in our analysis by appropriate scaling of the source strengths .",
    "since spatially homogeneous losses simply scale the semiclassical field amplitudes , thermal states remain thermal states under such attenuation.thus , a system resolving sources of strength @xmath62 using a detector with quantum efficiency @xmath140 can be modeled as a system with source strength @xmath141 and an ideal detector .    we have assumed through most of this paper that the centroid of the sources has been located at the optical axis . in optical astronomy applications , the centroid position may be available from previous observational records , or else a long observation time should be available to determine the centroid by , say , image - plane photon counting . in microscopy applications , the time available for measurements may be more limited , e.g. , because of photobleaching in fluorescent samples@xcite , and lack of knowledge of the centroid position can be a significant impediment to implementing sliver . to address this problem , one can first perform image - plane photon counting using a portion of the available light to determine the centroid position to within a small fraction of the psf width before implementing sliver . the simulations in sec .",
    "5.3 indicate that the mse of separation estimation should still be well below that achievable using image - plane photon counting . a more general study of the effects of centroid mismatch is best carried out in the framework of multi - parameter estimation theory and will be given elsewhere .",
    "apart from exploring these issues , various extensions and refinements of the schemes of this paper suggest themselves .",
    "for example , spatially - resolved detection in one or both output ports of the interferometer can only improve the performance of sliver . in any case",
    ", the results here should hopefully spur investigations into these issues in order to reap the superlocalization gain promised by the sliver method .",
