    "in recent years , the atomic force microscopy ( afm ) indentation has become a useful technique for quantifying the mechanical properties of soft polymers @xcite and biological materials @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that many biological tissues are characterized by anisotropy , and the case of transverse isotropy plays an important role for describing their symmetry properties @xcite .",
    "recently , the so - called cylindrical lateral indentation test , which utilizes lateral contact of a cylindrical indenter ( see fig .  [ figure ] ) , was developed by @xcite under the assumption that both poisson s ratios of the tested transversely isotropic elastic material are known .",
    "such a test can be approximately modeled @xcite in the framework of the two - dimensional contact model for an orthotropic elastic strip , which was was studied previously in @xcite .",
    "we note that in the asymptotic model @xcite it is assumed that the film thickness @xmath0 and the indenter radius , @xmath1 , should be small compared to the cylinder indenter length , @xmath2 , as well as the contact zone size , @xmath3 , should be small compared to the elastic film thickness @xmath0 .    however , although it is usual to assume in the indentation testing of an isotropic material that its poisson s ratio is known in advance @xcite , this assumption in the case of material anisotropy requires a careful consideration , especially for almost incompressible materials . on the other hand , in the case of incompressible transversely isotropic material , the previously developed model @xcite needs to be further refined .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ 1lcsection2 ] , the constitutive equations for a transversely isotropic material",
    "are written out in the principal coordinate system .",
    "the case of incompressible material is considered in section  [ 1lcsection33 ] . in section  [ 1lcsection44 ]",
    ", we outline the first - order asymptotic model for the displacement - force relationship . in section  [ 1lcsection77 ] , the material identification procedure for the cylindrical lateral indentation test is outlined and the corresponding anisotropic materials properties evaluation procedure is illustrated by an example .",
    "finally , in section  [ 1lcsectiondc ] , we present a discussion of the results obtained and formulate our conclusions .",
    "we assume that the tested tissue sample forms a homogeneous , transversely isotropic , and linearly elastic layer is deposited onto a smooth rigid substrate in such a way that the plane of isotropy is perpendicular to the substrate surface .",
    "if the @xmath4-plane coincides with the plane of isotropy , hooke s law for a transversely isotropic material can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 are infinitesimal strains , @xmath7 are stresses , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are young s modulus and poisson s ratio in the symmetry plane , @xmath10 is the in - plane shear modulus , @xmath11 is the longitudinal young s modulus , @xmath12 is poisson s ratio for loading in the longitudinal direction , and @xmath13 is the longitudinal shear modulus .",
    "recall also that transversely isotropic materials are characterized by five independent elastic constants ( namely , @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 ) , so that we have @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we assume that indenter has a shape of long cylinder oriented parallel to the material surface and is made from rigid material , so that the indenter deformation is negligible . because the layer thickness is assumed to be small compared to the cylinder indenter length",
    ", we apply a two - dimensional approximation for the stress - strain state beneath the indenter .",
    "we consider two cases , which differ by the orientation of the indenter cylinder with respect to the longitudinal axis of the transversely isotropic material .",
    "namely , in the longitudinal case the indenter cylinder is parallel to the axis of material symmetry , while in the transverse case it is parallel to the plane of isotropy and thus perpendicular to the material symmetry axis .",
    "if the indenter is oriented along the @xmath15-axis ( see fig .  [ figure ] ) , the strain - stress relations for the case of plane strain deformations in the @xmath16-plane are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ 1lc(2.1 ) ] ) under the assumption that @xmath17 in the following from : @xmath18    if the indenter is oriented along the @xmath19-axis , the strain - stress relations for the case of plane strain deformations in the @xmath4-plane are obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ 1lc(2.1 ) ] ) under the assumption that @xmath20 in the following from : @xmath21    equations ( [ 1lc(2.2 ) ] ) and ( [ 1lc(2.3 ) ] ) correspond to the longitudinal ( along to the @xmath19-axis ) and transverse ( perpendicular to the @xmath19-axis ) orientations of the cylinder indenter , respectively .",
    "if the tissue material is assumed to be incompressible , then the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath22 . as was shown by @xcite ,",
    "this incompressibility condition imposes two additional constrains on the components of the compliance tensor .",
    "thus , for an incompressible transversely isotropic material only 3 material constants remain independent and the following relations hold @xcite : @xmath23 at the same time , the condition of positive definiteness of the compliance tensor reduces to @xmath24    since poisson s ratio @xmath12 is known in advance , while poisson s ratio @xmath9 is expressed in terms of young s moduli @xmath8 and @xmath25 , the problem of material parameters identification reduces to the evaluation of the following elastic constants : @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 .",
    "however , instead of these three dimensional parameters , we will make use of the transverse young s modulus @xmath8 and two dimensionless ratios @xmath26    thus after evaluating the primary fitting elastic parameters @xmath8 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , the elastic moduli @xmath11 and @xmath13 can be easily determined by formulas @xmath29    note that in light of ( [ 1lc(2.65 ) ] ) , we will have @xmath30 .",
    "during the depth - sensing frictionless indentation , the indenter displacement @xmath31 ( indentation depth ) is related to the indentation load @xmath32 ( contact force ) by some nonlinear relation , which is approximated by the following first - order asymptotic formula @xcite : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is a characteristic length parameter , @xmath35 is a characteristic force parameter .",
    "the characteristic length parameter @xmath34 is determined solely by the geometry of both the elastic sample and the rigid indenter as follows : @xmath36 here , @xmath0 is the film sample thickness , @xmath1 is the radius of the indenter .",
    "the characteristic force parameter @xmath35 is defined by the formula @xmath37 where @xmath2 is the length of the indenter , and depends on an elastic constant @xmath38 , which will be defined later , and in the case of indentation testing , it is not known a priori .",
    "further , the asymptotic constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 are dimensionless parameters , which characterize not only the elastic properties of the film sample , but also the contact conditions between the sample and the rigid substrate . under the assumption of frictionless contact between the film and the rigid substrate ( i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath43 ) , we can make use of the following analytical formulas @xcite : @xmath44u\\,du .",
    "\\label{1lc(3.1b)}\\ ] ] here , @xmath45 is a dimensionless function , which depends on the elastic properties of the film sample as well as on the orientation of the indenter @xcite .      in the transverse case",
    "( indenter is oriented parallel to the @xmath15-axis and perpendicular to the @xmath19-axis ) , the asymptotic constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 are evaluated according to equations ( [ 1lc(5.d0 ) ] ) and ( [ 1lc(5.d1 ) ] ) , where the expression for the kernel function @xmath45 depends on the values of the elastic constants as follows @xcite : @xmath48 here we have introduced the notation @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51}{d{\\,\\rm sh}(2cu)+c\\sin(2du)},\\quad c=\\frac{\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}}{\\sqrt{2}},\\quad d=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{b}-a}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\quad ( a^2<b ) , \\label{1lc(2.9)}\\ ] ]    in the case of an incompressible material , the dimensionless parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 while the corresponding elastic constant @xmath55 is given by @xmath56    we note that the notation @xmath52 and @xmath53 is consistent with the notation @xmath11 and reflects the transverse orientation of the indenter cylinder to the axis of material symmetry .",
    "in the longitudinal case ( indenter is oriented along the @xmath19-axis ) , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 are independent of elastic properties of the sample and are evaluated as follows : @xmath61 in this case for incompressible material , the elastic constant @xmath62 is given by formula @xmath63 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 is defined by the first formula ( [ 1lc(5.k ) ] ) .",
    "in the transverse case , by fitting the experimental depth - load data with the analytical approximation ( [ 1lc(5.1 ) ] ) in view of ( [ 1lc(3.1b ) ] ) and ( [ 1lc(5.7)])([1lc(2.9 ) ] ) , one can determine the elastic constants @xmath27 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the corresponding best - fit value for @xmath35 in ( [ 1lc(5.1 ) ] ) .",
    "thus , in view of ( [ 1lc(5.d111 ) ] ) and ( [ 1lc(5.9 ) ] ) , we obtain @xmath67    formulas ( [ 1lc(5.9 ) ] ) and ( [ 1lc(5.10 ) ] ) solve the formulated above material properties identification problem .    in the longitudinal case",
    ", because the asymptotic constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 are independent of the material properties , fitting the experimental data for the force - displacement relationship with the analytical approximation ( [ 1lc(5.1 ) ] ) allows to determine only one elastic constant  @xmath62 .      to illustrate the outlined identification procedure , we consider the same cylindrical lateral depth - sensing indentation test for a collagen coating freely deposited on a glass substrate with the fibril direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis ( see fig .",
    "[ figure ] ) as considered in our previous study @xcite .",
    "the collagen membrane thickness is approximately 5  @xmath68 , while the indenter cylinder length is about 18  @xmath68 , and the cylinder diameter is 6  @xmath68 .    under the assumption of material incompressibility ,",
    "the following best - fit values were obtained : @xmath69  mpa , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . correspondingly , the normalized root - mean - square error of the best - fit approximation is @xmath72 .",
    "now , using the first two formulas ( [ 1lc(5.10 ) ] ) , we get approximation for the elastic moduli and the longitudinal shear modulus as follows : @xmath73  mpa , @xmath74  mpa , and @xmath75  mpa . in light of ( [ 1lc(2.64 ) ] ) we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "note also that the dimensional parameter @xmath78 , which is related to @xmath28 through formula @xmath79 , takes the following value : @xmath80 .    recall that under the assumption of prescribed values for the poisson s ratios @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the following data was obtained @xcite : @xmath83  mpa , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86  mpa , @xmath87  mpa , and @xmath88  mpa , whereas @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the complete incompressibility is a rather restrictive ( strong ) hypothesis , since the longitudinal elastic modulus @xmath11 demonstrated a 7 times decrease .",
    "thus , in order to be sure that the estimated young moduli are correctly evaluated , such an assumption should be thoroughly justified and a _ level of material incompressibility _ should be clarified .",
    "as it follows from the previous discussion , one can expect that for weakly compressible materials the material identification data is sensitive to the choice of the poisson s ratio values .",
    "taking for instance the typical values @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( assumed in @xcite for a soft highly anisotropic tissue with @xmath92 ) and utilizing the identification procedure based on the first - order model @xcite , we , in particular , obtain @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see table  [ table : nbdelta ] ) .",
    "note that the best - fit approximation error turns out to be an order of magnitude higher than in the previous cases ( see section  [ 1lcsection55 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the obtained value of the elastic moduli ratio @xmath95 comes in contradiction with the following thermodynamic limitation imposed on the poisson s ratio @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath96    0.2 cm    .",
    "variation of the evaluated moduli ratio @xmath95 , the upper bound @xmath97 for the poisson s ratio @xmath9 , and the approximation error @xmath98 for different values of the poisson s ratio @xmath9 and a prescribed value of the poisson s ratio @xmath90 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    [ table : nbdelta ]    we also present in table  [ table : nbdelta ] the result of evaluation of the young moduli for different values of the poisson s ratio @xmath99 .",
    "the material parameters evaluated for @xmath100 do not also satisfy the restriction ( [ 1lc(5.le ) ] ) and thus can not be accepted .",
    "therefore , in the case of slight incompressibility similar to that considered in @xcite , it is suggested first to solve the material parameters identification problem using the algorithm proposed in this paper under the assumption of the complete incompressibility , thus obtaining an upper bound for the poisson s ratio @xmath9 .",
    "after that , utilizing the algorithm @xcite , one can adjust step - by - step the values of poisson s ratios in such a way that the right - hand side inequality in ( [ 1lc(5.le ) ] ) is preserved , while the approximation error is kept to a minimum .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that in the case of thin layers , when the size of the contact zone is much larger than the layer thickness , the concept of a weakly incompressible layer can be introduced @xcite , which takes into account the interplay between the material and geometrical parameters .",
    "the same approach can be utilized in the indentation problem under consideration . however , in the case of anisotropic material , one should take care of two small parameters , which define how the two bulk moduli describe the material behavior when its incompressibility increases .    summarizing , in the present paper",
    ", the first - order asymptotic model for the frictionless unilateral contact of a cylindrical indenter is applied for the development of cylindrical lateral indentation tests for thin ( compared to the cylinder indenter length ) transversely isotropic elastic samples under the assumption of material incompressibility .",
    "the proposed indentation material parameters identification method utilizes the depth - load indentation data for the cylinder indenter oriented orthogonal to the fiber direction only .",
    "if the depth - load data are available for the other indenter position ( along the fiber direction ) , they can be additionally used for verifying the predicted value of the transverse modulus  @xmath8 .",
