    "the measurement of a single electron spin in a semiconductor qd is of great importance , because an electron spin in a qd is proposed to be a key element to construct new optical and electronic devices , including a spin - based quantum computer @xcite .",
    "a long decoherence time of the electronic spin is vital , but no experimental result for the lifetime of a truly single electron spin in a single qd has been reported so far , due to the lack of capability of measuring a single electron spin non - destructively .",
    "photoluminescence ( pl ) measurement has been used to access an individual qd @xcite .",
    "since pl measurement is a destructive process in a sense that real excitation and recombination of an electron - hole pair is involved , it is impossible to monitor a single electron spin non - destructively and continuously for a certain period of time .",
    "an alternative method , time - resolved faraday rotation ( trfr ) has been developed @xcite , which enables one to monitor the spin continuously , but a single spin measurement sensitivity has not been achieved yet @xcite .    in this paper , we propose an optical readout method based on the interaction between a single electron spin in a single qd and microcavity field , which enables us to perform qnd monitoring of a single spin . in the proposed system , the phase shift of the probe light incurred by a single spin is enhanced by a microcavity .",
    "the coupled cavity - qd system is formulated by the quantum langevin equations , and the response of the input probe light is analyzed quantitatively .",
    "it is shown that the polarization - sensitive mach - zehnder interferometer operating at the standard - quantum - limit can perform the qnd measurement of a single electron spin , if the qd is incorporated into a high - q microcavity or photonic bandgap structure .",
    "this proposal is motivated by the recent experimental demonstration of a gaas / alas dbr post - microcavity with a single inas qd and an optical mode volume of @xmath0 @xcite and theoretical prediction that such a microcavity should have a q - value of higher than @xmath1 @xcite .",
