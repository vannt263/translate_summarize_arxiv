    "<S> however , the gate bias also dopes graphene . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath90k , as the fermi energy of graphene approaches half the g - mode phonon energy  @xcite , one might also expect significant anomalous g - mode softening , which could lead to a non - linear correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be rationalized by considering a small residual charge inhomogeneity on the order of @xmath98   and @xmath95 due to electron - phonon coupling at 4  k and 100  k ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) , a temperature that is well above the unavoidable laser heating we can estimate in our conditions . ] . in such conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the g - mode frequency is not expected to vary significantly with the gate - induced doping ( see gray bar in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the 2d - mode frequency is expected to be virtually independent of the doping level for @xmath99  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the g- and 2d - mode softening are essentially due to electrostatically - induced tensile strain , with a possible minor contribution from anomalous g - mode softening that may lead to a linear correlation with a slope slightly smaller that typically reported values  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the elusive phonon anomalies  @xcite will be intrinsically challenging to unveil in monolayer graphene as their fingerprints will be smeared out by tiny residual charge inhomogeneity and strain - induced phonon softening . </S>",
    "<S> however , the impact of the charge carrier concentration can still be probed through the narrowing of the g - mode feature ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d ) . with the maximum g - mode frequency downshift of @xmath100@xmath87 with respect to its initial value at @xmath32 , we estimate an electrostatically - induced strain of @xmath101% in the case of uniaxial ( biaxial ) stress  @xcite . this _ local _ </S>",
    "<S> strain evaluated through phonon softening in the middle of the trench is in qualitative agreement with an estimated _ average _ strain of @xmath102 based on the measurement of @xmath25 and assuming a parabolic profile . </S>",
    "<S> these estimations suggest that the electrostatically - applied stress is predominantly uniaxial , as can be expected within our sample geometry ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> , tensile strain may lead to a slight broadening of the g - mode feature ( @xmath103 ) that may partly compensate the suppression of landau damping at large gate bias ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> * conclusion * using raman spectroscopy , we have achieved a contactless , minimally invasive study of electrostatically - gated suspended graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane deflection is estimated with a vertical resolution as low as a few nm and a diffraction - limited lateral resolution . </S>",
    "<S> a simple electromechanical model provides a faithful description of the membrane deflection , up to irreversible collapse , and an estimation of the built - in tension , a poorly controlled parameter , however of utmost importance in nanoresonators . </S>",
