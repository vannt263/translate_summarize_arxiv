    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are perhaps the leading candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) making up most of the nonrelativistic mass density of the universe today @xcite .",
    "although candidate wimps are 10 to 1000 times more massive than nucleons and have no electromagnetic or color charges , their cosmic histories share many parallels with nucleons . after their abundances froze out at @xmath5 the number density of photons , both wimps and nucleons remained thermally coupled to the plasma by elastic scattering with abundant relativistic particles .",
    "acoustic oscillations in the relativistic plasma imprinted oscillations on both wimps and nucleons .",
    "eventually the plasma released its grip on both types of particles . for wimps , this event",
    "is called kinetic decoupling ; for nucleons , recombination .    during kinetic decoupling ,",
    "friction between the wimp gas and relativistic plasma led to silk damping of small - scale waves similar to what happened much later for atomic matter at recombination .",
    "after the respective decoupling periods ended , pressure forces ( and in the case of wimps , shear stress ) inhibited gravitational instability on small scales . still later , both wimps and nucleons played a major role in galaxy formation .",
    "there are , of course , significant differences between the cosmic evolution of wimps and nucleons .",
    "most evident are the quantitative differences : because their interactions are so weak , wimps decoupled from the plasma less than one second after the big bang .",
    "consequently the wimp acoustic oscillations appear only on a length scale vastly smaller ( @xmath6 parsec scales ) than the baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "the physics of nucleon decoupling , as imprinted in the galaxy distribution @xcite and in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite provides a powerful probe of cosmic parameters and inflationary cosmology .",
    "if it were possible to similarly measure fluctuations on the scale of wimp acoustic oscillations , we would have a dramatic consistency test of the cosmological model as well as an astrophysical measurement of wimp properties .",
    "one way to constrain the parameters of cold dark matter decoupling is to measure the mass function of the smallest dark matter clumps today @xcite .",
    "such clumps would be far too diffuse to host observable concentrations of atomic matter .",
    "however , they might be observable through the products of the very rare wimp - wimp annihilations taking place in the cores of these objects .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that numerous earth - mass clumps might survive to the present day and provide a detectable gamma - ray signal .",
    "the mass and abundance of these clumps depends on cosmic fluctuation evolution during and after kinetic decoupling .",
    "wimps and nucleons also differ in a qualitative manner which has important consequences for the evolution of fluctuations through kinetic decoupling .",
    "after recombination , elastic scattering is rapid enough for atoms ( and the residual free electrons ) to behave as a nearly perfect gas on cosmological scales .",
    "baryons behave like a fluid .",
    "wimps , however , collide too infrequently to thermalize after kinetic decoupling .",
    "wimps behave like a collisionless gas .",
    "different approximations to the evolution of this collisionless gas have led to different results for the small - scale transfer function of cdm fluctuations @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the transfer functions for cdm fluctuations are calculated starting from the full boltzmann equation describing elastic scattering between wimps and the relativistic leptons present before neutrino decoupling and electron - positron pair annihilation .",
    "because the momentum transfer per collision with nonrelativistic wimps is small , the boltzmann equation reduces to the fokker - planck equation describing diffusion in velocity space caused by elastic scattering , combined with advection and gravitational forces .",
    "the fokker - planck equation fully describes kinetic decoupling and the evolution of perturbations of any length scale without approximating the wimps either as a perfect fluid or fully collisionless gas .",
    "although the solution of the perturbed fokker - planck equation is more difficult than the solution of coupled fluid and collisionless boltzmann equations , it is both numerically and analytically tractable ( with an excellent approximation ) in the present case .",
    "after kinetic decoupling , two additional events have an effect on the cdm transfer function .",
    "the first is electron - positron pair annihilation , which changes the equation of state of the plasma thereby modifying the evolution of fluctuations .",
    "although the effects are small , they can be analytically calculated .",
    "the more important event is the transition from a radiation- to matter - dominated universe occurring about @xmath7 years after the big bang .",
    "if the photons and neutrinos are treated as fluids , it is possible to get analytic results for the linear evolution all the way to low redshift which are accurate to a few percent . with these results in place , using standard techniques it is straightforward to estimate the mass function of cdm clumps at high redshift .",
    "weakly interacting dark matter particles are described by their phase space density , which obeys the boltzmann equation governing transport by collisions with leptons ( during kinetic decoupling these are just electrons , positrons , and neutrinos ) .",

    "these results for @xmath504 are uncertain because there are window functions @xmath493 that give a different result .",
    "for example , a sharp @xmath178-space filter , with @xmath505 for @xmath506 and zero otherwise , when combined with the free - streaming damping of @xmath431 , leads to an exponential cutoff instead of a power - law rise of @xmath507 as @xmath508 .",

    "[ fig : figps2 ] provides an enormous challenge to numerical simulation methods attempting to determine the survival of the first forming halos @xcite .",
    "the small - scale transfer function of cold dark matter encodes rich information about wimp physics . were it possible to measure the power spectrum on scales below a solar mass , with precision similar to cosmic microwave background measurements on degree angular scales , we could hope to determine the wimp mass and elastic scattering cross section with leptons by astrophysical means .",
    "this seems far - fetched because of the tremendous degree of nonlinear processing that has occurred since the first cold dark matter structures formed at a redshift about 50 .",
    "however , if any of the smallest bound objects survive tidal stripping , they may produce an observable wimp annihilation signal @xcite which provides a window into particle physics .",
    "moreover , the nearly scale - invariant structure predicted for dark matter fluctuations on mass scales below @xmath512 m@xmath4 could affect the formation of larger - mass structures .",
    "this mass range is very difficult to study with standard numerical simulation methods .",
    "while the present work has answered the question of how small - scale fluctuations in the wimp distribution evolve during the linear stage of evolution , it raises new questions about nonlinear halo formation .",
    "if the press - schechter formalism with a local spatial filter ( or analytic window function ) correctly describes the formation of the smallest halos , then there is no minimum mass for wimp microhalos ; the mass function @xmath513 for @xmath514 m@xmath4 .",
    "most of the mass , however , is in larger clumps .",
    "nonlinear evolution is likely to strongly modify the press - schechter distribution .",
    "not only is tidal stripping important , but the press - schechter model is based on the assumption of hierarchical clustering , which breaks down on the small scales considered here .    the present paper has considered dark matter only in the form of a thermal relic , i.e. particles that were once in thermal equilibrium with the relativistic plasma of the early universe",
    ". the dark matter may be instead a nonthermal relic  the axion  which began its life as a bose - einstein condensate .",
