    "origin of turbulence and then the viscosity parameter @xmath1 , while has been demonstrated for a hot keplerian accretion disk by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; balbus , hawley , & stone 1996 ; hawley , balbus , & winters 1999 ) , is still not well understood for cold disks , e.g. accretion disks around quiescent cataclysmic variables ( gammie & menou 1998 ; menou 2000 ) , proto - planetary and star - forming disks ( blaes & balbus 1994 ) , and the outer region of disks in active galactic nuclei ( menou & quataert 2001 ) , even after more than three decades of the famous discovery of the @xmath1-disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "these cold systems are largely neutral in charge so that the mri driven turbulence appears to be ruled out .",
    "however , to support accretion , there must appear some sort of turbulence ( most likely pure hydrodynamic in nature ) and then the corresponding turbulent viscosity , as the molecular viscosity is negligible .",
    "richard & zahn ( 1999 ) indeed showed by analyzing results of laboratory experiments for the classical couette - taylor flow that in the case where angular momentum increases outward , similar to the keplerian flow , hydrodynamic turbulence may be sustained .",
    "then they derived the corresponding turbulent viscosity which is very useful for the astrophysical purpose .",
    "longaretti ( 2002 ) argued that the keplerian accretion flow in the shearing sheet limit should be turbulent and the lack of turbulence in simulations is due to lack of their resolution .",
    "then lesur & longaretti ( 2005 ) showed that the required resolution is not possible to achieve with the presently available computer resources .",
    "they also found that the efficiency of turbulent transport is directly correlated to the critical reynolds number for the transition to turbulence .",
    "inspite of all these analyzes , the actual origin of hydrodynamic turbulence in such systems still remains unclear .",
    "it is important to note that the numerical simulation has never been carried out with a _ very high _ reynolds number what the real accretion disk exhibits .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamic effects may compete with the magnetohydrodynamic effects ( essentially mri ) at a high reynolds number and , in a realistic system , turbulence may be due to hydrodynamic effects independent of whether the disk is cold or hot .",
    "recently , several authors including ourselves have put their efforts in achieving progress toward the solution of this difficult problem ( e.g. tevzadze et al .",
    "2003 ; chagelishvili 2003 ; umurhan & regev 2004 ; yecko 2004 ; mukhopadhyay , afshordi & narayan 2005 ; afshordi , mukhopadhyay & narayan 2005 ; johnson & gammie 2005 ; umurhan et al .",
    "2006 ; barranco & marcus 2005 ; papaloizou 2005 ) .",
    "the main aim of these works is to demonstrate the _ pure _ hydrodynamic turbulence by transient growth of energy with the suitable choice of two - dimensional initial perturbation .",
    "the idea is any large growth plausibly could switch the accretion disk into the nonlinear regime which might result its subcritical transition to turbulence if energy growth exceeds the threshold for turbulence .",
    "one might argue that transient growth , even if large , can not provide much clue on the existence and properties of a turbulent basin of attraction .",
    "schmid & henningson ( 2001 ) and criminale , jackson & joslin ( 2003 ) have described in detail that transition to turbulence is not a unique process but it depends on the initial condition / disturbance and the nature of the flow .",
    "in fact , it is known that even in presence of secondary instability linearly unstable base flows may reach to a non - turbulent saturated state .",
    "however , turbulence definitely belongs to the nonlinear regime and it is exhibited only in the situations when large growth ( or more precisely transient growth for the present purpose ) switches the system over the non - linear regime . as our present goal is to understand the possible origin of hydrodynamic turbulence , we consider those situations when large transient growth governs non - linearity . at the present case where the accretion time scale is comparable ( or shorter ) to the time scale to achieve maximum growth ( man ) , decaying nature of growth at a period longer than the accretion time scale",
    "does not matter .",
    "if growth ( or maximum growth ) becomes large enough that exceeds the threshold to trigger non - linearity and turbulence , then it does not matter whether growth evolves exponentially or transiently .",
    "dauchot & manneville ( 1997 ) argued with a toy model that transient growth does not guaranty the transition to turbulence as the underlying phase portraits do not get deformed much in absence of any linearly unstable mode .",
    "however , that does not rule out the importance of transient growth as their model is very simplistic consisting of two variables only and growth is tinny to expect any deformation in the phase portraits .",
    "other alternative methods were proposed to describe the subcritical transition to turbulence and then to investigate various underlying aspects in detail by e.g. waleffe ( 1995 , 1997 ) , brosa & grossmann ( 1999 ) , waleffe ( 2003 ) , kerswell ( 2005 ) , while last two works , that discuss non - rotating couette flows and pipe flows respectively , are mostly relevant for the astrophysical purpose . although the works bring some new insight into the subject , the main problem i.e. to understand the subcritical turbulence in three - dimension remains unsolved .",
    "this is indeed a non - trivial problem not only in astrophysics but also in fluid dynamics . in the present paper",
    ", we suggest a possible mechanism to govern non - linear effect into a keplerian accretion disk .",
    "while our prescription does not solve the problem completely , it certainly opens up a new avenue to understand the physics behind this puzzle .",
    "the problem with transient growth , what has been proposed as the mechanism to generate turbulence ( e.g. umurhan & regev 2004 ; hereafter ur ; mukhopadhyay , afshordi & narayan 2005 , afshordi , mukhopadhyay & narayan 2005 ; hereafter man ) , is that in two - dimension underlying perturbations must ultimately decline to zero in the viscous flow . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "it is necessary to invoke three - dimensional effects .",
    "various kinds of secondary instability , such as the elliptical instability , are widely discussed as a possible route to self - sustained turbulence in linearly perturbed shear flows ( see , e.g. pierrehumbert 1986 ; bayly 1986 ; hellberg & orszag 1988 ; craik 1989 ; le dize , rossi & moffatt 1996 ; kerswell 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we are motivated to see whether these three - dimensional instabilities are present in the keplerian flows which consist of elliptical streamlines under two - dimensional perturbation .",
    "goodman ( 1993 ) first explored the possible role of the elliptical instability in an accretion disk and lubow , pringle & kerswell ( 1993 ) and ryu & goodman ( 1994 ) showed that angular momentum may be transferred from the disk to the tidal source by the instability effect .",
    "they essentially considered the case of forced disks .",
    "later , ioannou & kakouris ( 2001 ) also examined transient growth being constantly re - excited by external noise .",
    "the three - dimensional instability of a two - dimensional flow with elliptical vortices has been demonstrated by number of authors ( e.g. craik & criminale 1986 ; waleffe 1990 ) and has been proposed as a generic mechanism for the breakdown of many two - dimensional high reynolds number flows .",
    "this result motivates us to investigate whether the similar scenarios exist in a keplerian accretion disk .",
    "therefore , essentially we plan to investigate the keplerian flow with two consecutive perturbation effects . the primary two - dimensional perturbation , which drives transient growth ( man ) , governs elliptical streamlines in the flow .",
    "then we consider the further three - dimensional perturbation , that is the secondary one , to this two - dimensional flow , if that drives three - dimensional instability effect in presence of viscosity .",
    "presumably , three - dimensional instabilities lead to nonlinear feedback and self - sustained turbulence .    although the maximum growth in the keplerian disk with finite vertical thickness and then with finite vertical perturbation is smaller compared to that in a two - dimensional keplerian disk , as tevzadze et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and man argued , vertical stratification may cause to have a nonvanishing asymptotic growth that is a fraction of the maximum growth . however , they could not show whether this will significantly help the onset of turbulence . by three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "barranco & marcus ( 2005 ) studied the dynamics and formation of vortices in stably stratified proto - planetary disks and found that vortices are unstable under perturbation .",
    "theoretically , the origin of these vortices is understood as perturbation in plane shear flow ( ur , man ) .",
    "continuing in the same line of thought , recently , umurhan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown substantial growth resulting from initial perturbations in the linearly stable steady state and have concluded that significant perturbation energy amplification occurs in accretion disks on a global scale .",
    "in the present paper , we perform a local linear analysis in the shearing box approximation .",
    "although a small section of an accretion disk may not reproduce the global disk properties , we assume that if turbulence is exhibited at any section , then that sustains and eventually affects the entire disk . while the local result does not guaranty its global signature , absence of local instability and then possible turbulence , perhaps , does guaranty its global absence . therefore , from the results of this paper we can determine the future avenues of the subject , whether the analyzes for secondary instability including transient growth is a fruitful path to solve the problem .",
    "in the next section , we outline the basic model considered for this problem describing primary and secondary perturbation . in  3 , we present the simple solution when the evolution of secondary perturbation is much rapid than that of primary one .",
    "subsequently , in  4 we analyze the general solutions when both perturbations vary simultaneously .",
    "finally we sum up the results with a discussion in  5 .",
    "we consider a small portion of the keplerian flow centered on radius @xmath2 ( see man for detail ) .",
    "therefore , the keplerian flow locally reduces to rotating couette flow in a narrow gap limit whose unperturbed velocity vector is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the navier - stokes and the continuity equations for the dynamics of viscous incompressible disk fluid are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the reynolds number , the angular frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the time , and @xmath10 is proportional to the pressure . for a keplerian disk @xmath11 and for a constant angular momentum disk @xmath12 . here , all the variables are expressed in dimensionless units .",
    "the unit of length is the box size in the radial direction and the unit of velocity is the maximum relative velocity between two fluid elements into the box .",
    "below we describe two subsequent perturbation effects , primary and secondary , one by one .      under a linear two - dimensional ( primary ) perturbation , the velocity vector of the ( primary ) flow reduces as @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 is a tensor of rank @xmath16 , the position vector @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the components of the wave vector of perturbation , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the amplitude of the vorticity perturbation .",
    "now we concentrate on a further small patch of the primarily perturbed flow so that the spatial scale is very small compared to the wavelength of primary perturbation , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 comes out to be @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the above @xmath23 indicates the flow pattern to be a generalized elliptical one compared to that discussed in standard fluid literature ( e.g. bayly 1986 ; craik 1989 ; kerswell 2000 ) as an ordinary elliptical flow given by @xmath26      the background flow for further perturbation ( secondary one ) also corresponds to eqn .",
    "( [ nevst2 ] ) except @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "the secondary perturbation modifies components of the velocity in eqn .",
    "( [ primper ] ) and the pressure as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the perturbation is considered to be plane wave typed given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the latin indices run from @xmath33 to @xmath34 such that e.g. @xmath35 , and thus the background velocity can be written as @xmath36 .",

    "( [ nevst2 ] ) , ( [ axy ] ) and ( [ pet ] ) with replacing @xmath27 by @xmath28 and after some algebra , we obtain the evolution of a linear secondary perturbation @xmath37 along with @xmath38 where the ` over - dot ' indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath39 is a levi - civita tensor , and @xmath40 .",

    "this verifies that secondary perturbation can govern significant transient growth in a geometrically thin accretion disk with finite vertical thickness . however , in three - dimension , when @xmath145 , the secondary perturbation effect always dominates over the primary one .",

    "the effective wave vector of perturbation is in the @xmath156 direction ( @xmath157 ) and is negative which provides very asymmetric leading waves .",
    "therefore , the flow at this stage is highly eccentric . as time goes on ,",
    "the wavefronts are straightened out by the shear and @xmath158 decreases and transient growth increases . when @xmath159 , i.e. the wavefronts become almost radial , transient growth is maximum . at this time",
    ", the streamlines of the flow are almost circular . at yet later time , growth decreases and the wave becomes trailing . then it has been argued that if the maximum growth exceeds the threshold for inducing turbulence , then this mechanism could drive the system to a turbulent state .",
    "presumably , once the system becomes turbulent , it remains turbulent as a result of nonlinear interactions and feedback among the perturbations .",
    "it can be reminded that our present aim is to understand and establish the origin of viscosity in the flow that must be due to turbulence .",
    "the transfer of mass inward and angular momentum outward in an accretion disk is difficult to explain in absence of turbulence .",
    "however , the accretion disk is quite a complex system with , possibly , continuous perturbed flow .",
    "therefore , if we can address a mechanism to govern turbulence , then its recycling is not a difficult job .",
    "second , we consider further perturbation , namely secondary perturbation , into the flow described above .",
    "the primarily perturbed shear flow serves as a background for secondary perturbation whose eccentricity naturally varies with time due to the evolution of primary perturbation . in this paper",
    ", we have especially demonstrated the evolution of this secondary perturbation which exhibits three - dimensional large transient growth in a local keplerian accretion disk . while primary perturbation itself can produce large transient growth at a high reynolds number that might drive the non - linear effects into the system , the best perturbation responsible for this effect is two - dimensional .",
    "however , it is understood that perturbations must ultimately decline to zero in presence of viscosity ( see e.g. ur ) , unless three - dimensional effects are invoked .",
    "therefore , we have addressed the possible origin of three - dimensional effects that shows a clear route to three - dimensional hydrodynamic growth and then possible non - linear feedback and turbulence in accretion flows .",
    "underlying growth arises due to the elliptical vortices present in the background , rather than due to the plane shear which exhibited growth under primary perturbation .    in the standard fluid literature",
    ", the elliptical instability has been widely discussed as a possible route to self - sustained turbulence in linearly perturbed shear flows , as mentioned in  1 . however , usual emphasis of those investigations is on non - rotating flows .",
    "craik ( 1989 ) , while discussed about the elliptical instability in rotating shear flows , did not focus on a keplerian flow , what is of astrophysical interest .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we have first discussed the growth rate in standard elliptical flows and compared the results for non - rotating flows with that of rotating ones in  3.1 .",
    "we have shown that the growth rate in a keplerian flow with constant elliptical streamlines is significantly large compared to that in a non - rotating flow , particularly at high eccentricity .",
    "however , in reality , when a small section of a keplerian accretion disk is considered under a two - dimensional linear perturbation , the flow governs distorted elliptical streamlines whose structure vary with time .",
    "therefore , the growth rate due to secondary perturbation at a fixed @xmath45 ( instantaneous growth rate ) as described in  3.2 decreases much compared to that in the flow with idealized elliptical streamlines , unless the amplitude of primary perturbation , @xmath20 , is very large . at a @xmath114 , a pure vertical secondary perturbation produces the best growing eigenmode . on the other hand , at a @xmath160 , the best growing eigenmode arises due to other three - dimensional perturbations with a significant , but not sole , vertical effect .",
    "although the instantaneous growth rate appears to be small for a small @xmath20 ( which is of particular interest ) , at least compared to the case with idealized elliptical streamlines , actual growth which is the result of simultaneous evolution of both perturbations as described in  4 can be large enough to exhibit non - linear effects if the time - scale for the evolution of perturbation is large .",
    "the time for the evolution of perturbation scales with the reynolds number of the flow as @xmath161 ( man ) . as perturbation evolves , @xmath120 varies from @xmath162 to @xmath163 and thus the eccentricity of the flow decreases from @xmath33 to @xmath163 .",
    "most of the important three - dimensional growing modes are generated at the high eccentricity regime when @xmath164 and therefore @xmath165 .",
    "important fact to note is that growth maximizes for three - dimensional perturbation with a significant vertical effect .",
    "we therefore conclude with an important caveat .",
    "ur already showed via two - dimensional simulations that chaotic motions can persist for a time much longer than the time scale needed for linear growth .",
    "however , the corresponding vorticity decays unless the vertical structure is there . in the present paper",
    ", we have shown the existence of three - dimensional perturbation effects and corresponding eigenmodes which governs large energy growth and then suggests the possible existence of non - linear effects and self - sustained hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks . now one will have to verify our suggestion by numerical simulation with proper resolution and possibly also by nonlinear analytic asymptotic methods .",
