    "direct photons are one of the most powerful probes to investigate properties of the matter created by heavy ion collisions since they leave the medium without a strong interaction once they are generated . the direct photons are emitted from every stage of the collisions , and their transverse momenta are characterized by their origins .",
    "especially , the low and intermediate @xmath6 region ( @xmath7  gev/@xmath1 ) is considered as a suitable window for measuring the medium - induced direct photons  @xcite .",
    "primary contributors in the low and intermediate @xmath6 region are considered to be thermal photons from qgp and photons produced in jet - medium interactions such as jet - photon conversions and in - medium bremsstrahlung , respectively .",
    "it is quite certain that the direct photons below 5.0  gev/@xmath1 provide rich information of the created matter , but it is very challenging to measure them due to a large background from hadron decays .    in the phenix experiment , two different analysis methods , namely , a real photon method and a virtual photon method , have been successfully developed .",
    "measurements of real direct photons using an electromagnetic calorimeter in p+p and au+au collisions have been made successfully in @xmath8gev/@xmath1 at the phenix experiment  @xcite , and the results are in agreement with the next - to - leading - order perturbative qcd ( nlo pqcd ) calculation .",
    "the measurement using the virtual photon method can be extended to @xmath9gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the results of the direct photon measurements with the virtual photon method at phenix are presented in this report .",
    "in general , any source of real photons can emit virtual photons which convert to low mass @xmath3 pair .",
    "a direct photon production process such as @xmath10 has an associated process that produces low mass @xmath3 pair , i.e. @xmath11 . the relation between the photon production and the associated @xmath3 pair production is expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq_kw ]  @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fine structure constant , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the masses of the electron and the e@xmath16e@xmath17 pair , respectively , @xmath18 is a process dependent factor and @xmath19 is an emission rate of the photons . in the case of @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 dalitz decays ( kroll - wada formula ) , @xmath18 is given as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the form factor and @xmath24 is the mass of the parent hadron .",
    "the @xmath18 factor is obviously zero for @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath18 factor becomes unity for @xmath26 in the case of direct @xmath2 decays .",
    "therefore it is possible to extract the direct @xmath2 component from the e@xmath16e@xmath17 mass spectrum by utilizing the difference in e@xmath16e@xmath17 mass dependence of the @xmath18 factor .",
    "the region @xmath27gev/@xmath1 and @xmath4mev/@xmath5 satisfies the requirement for applying the virtual photon method that @xmath26 . the left and center panels in fig .",

    "the symbols and lines show the data and hadronic cocktail calculations . while the p+p result is in good agreement with the cocktail calculation and a small excess over the cocktail calculation",
    "is observed for @xmath28gev/@xmath1 , an enhancement over the cocktail calculation is clearly seen in au+au collisions in @xmath29mev/@xmath5 .    the following function , eq .",
    "[ eq_fit ] is fitted to the data in order to determine the fraction of the direct @xmath2 component in the @xmath3 mass distribution .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass distribution from the decay of neutral hadrons estimated using the cocktail calculation and @xmath32 is the expected distribution from the direct @xmath2 decays  @xcite , and @xmath33 is the direct @xmath2 fraction .",

    "[ mass_fit ] shows the e@xmath16e@xmath17 mass distribution in au+au collisions for @xmath34gev/@xmath1 together with the fit result by eq .",
    "[ eq_fit ] shown as a thick solid black line .",
    "assuming that this excess comes from direct @xmath2 decays , the fit result agrees with the data even in @xmath35mev/@xmath5 shown as a dotted black line . on the other hand , assuming that the excess comes from @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath36 is used in place of @xmath37 , anomalous @xmath21 enhancement is required to reproduce the excess .",

    "[ d_photon ] shows the obtained direct @xmath2 fractions as a function of @xmath6 in p+p and au+au collisions .",

    "the p+p result is consistent with nlo pqcd calculations in @xmath39gev/@xmath1 , but a modified power law function as shown by the dashed curve , @xmath40 , describes the p+p result better .",
