    "the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions has been , to this day , tested to a remarkable degree of accuracy , particularly in what concerns the neutral current sector .",
    "however it is clear that suffers from several theoretical drawbacks ( naturalness , triviality , ... ) making it conceivable that it should be considered as an effective theory valid only at low energies ( @xmath0 tev ) . with the current limit on the higgs mass already placed at 113,5 gev @xcite and no clear evidence for the existence of an elementary scalar ( despite much controversy regarding the results of the last days of lep ) it makes sense to envisage an alternative to the minimal standard model described by an effective theory without any physical light scalar fields .",
    "this in spite of the seemingly good agreement between experiment and radiative corrections computed in the framework of the minimal standard model ( see @xcite however ) . this effective theory should contain an infinite set of effective operators , of increasing dimensionality , compatible with the electroweak and strong symmetries @xmath1 and their coefficients would parametrize physics beyond the standard model . in this framework @xcite one can describe the low energy physics of theories exhibiting the pattern of symmetry breaking @xmath2 with full generality , in the understanding , that this approach is useful as long as those particles not explicitly included in the effective lagrangian are much heavier than the scale of energies at which the effective lagrangian is to be used .    in this work",
    "we plan to investigate the new features that physics beyond the standard model may introduce in the production of the top ( or anti - top ) quarks through @xmath3-gluon fusion at the lhc .",
    "when describing the appropriate effective vertex in the effective lagrangian language , we will keep only the leading non - universal ( i.e. not appearing in the standard model ) effective operators in the low energy expansion .",
    "they correspond to the operators of dimension four , which were first classified by appelquist et al .",
    "these operators realize the @xmath4 symmetry non - linearly and are thus characteristic of strongly coupled theories and , strictly speaking , are absent in the minimal standard model and modifications thereof containing only light fields , such as supersymmetric extensions , where all degrees of freedom are weakly interacting and need to be included explicitly . when particularizing to interactions involving the @xmath5 bosons , the operators present in the effective electroweak lagrangian induce effective vertices coupling the gauge boson to the matter fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath6 other possible effects are not physically observable , as we shall see in a moment . in practical terms",
    ", lhc will set bounds on these effective @xmath3 vertices , and therefore our results are also relevant in a broader phenomenological context as a way to bound @xmath7 and @xmath8 , without any need to appeal to an underlying effective lagrangian describing a specific model of symmetry breaking .",
    "of course one then looses the power of an effective lagrangian , namely a well defined set of counting rules and the ability to relate different processes .",
    "another point to note is that , even in the minimal standard model , radiative corrections induce modifications in the vertices . assuming a smooth dependence in the external momenta these form factors can be expanded in powers of momenta . at the lowest order in the derivative expansion",
    ", the effect of radiative corrections can be encoded in the effective vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus these effective vertices take well defined , calculable values in the minimal standard model , and any deviation from these values ( which , incidentally , have not been yet fully determined in the standard model yet ) would indicate the presence of new physics in the matter sector .",
    "the extent to what lhc can set direct bounds on the effective vertices , in particular on those involving the third generation , is highly relevant to constraint physics beyond the standard model in a direct way .",
    "this paper is devoted to such an analysis in charged processes involving a top quark at the lhc .    at the lhc energy",
    "( 14 tev ) the dominant mechanism of top production , with a cross section of 800 pb@xcite , is gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "this mechanism has nothing to do with the electroweak sector and thus is not the most adequate for our purposes ( although is the one producing most of the tops and thus its consideration becomes necessary in order to study the top couplings through their decay , which will not be our main interest here , and also as a background to the process we shall be interested in ) .",
    "electroweak physics enters the game in single top production .",
    "( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite . ) at lhc energies the ( by far ) dominant electroweak subprocess contributing to single top production is given by a gluon ( @xmath9 ) coming from one proton and a light quark or anti - quark coming from the other ( this process is also called @xmath10-channel production @xcite ) .",
    "this process is depicted in figs .",
    "[ u+gt+b - d+tot ] and [ d - gt+b - u - tot ] , where light @xmath11-type quarks or @xmath12-type antiquarks are extracted from the proton , respectively .",
    "these quarks then radiate a @xmath3 whose effective couplings is the object of our interest .",
    "the cross total section for this process at the lhc is estimated to be 250 pb@xcite , to be compared to 50 pb for the associated production with a @xmath13 boson and a @xmath14-quark extracted from the sea of the proton , and 10 pb corresponding to quark - quark fusion ( @xmath15-channel production ) . for comparison , at the tevatron ( 2 gev )",
    "the cross section for @xmath3-gluon fusion is 2.5 pb , so the production of tops through this particular subprocess is copious at the lhc .",
    "monte carlo simulations including the analysis of the top decay products indicate that this process can be analyzed in detail at the lhc and traditionally has been regarded as the most important one for our purposes .    in a proton - proton collision",
    "a bottom - anti - top pair is also produced , through the subprocesses given in figs .",
    "[ d+gt - b+u+tot ] and [ u - gt - b+d - tot ] .",
    "at any rate qualitative results are very similar to those corresponding to top production , from where the cross sections can be easily derived doing the appropriate changes .    in the context of effective theories , the contribution from operators of dimension five to top production via longitudinal vector boson fusion was estimated some time ago in @xcite , although the study was by no means complete .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath16 pair production through this mechanism is very much masked by the dominant mechanism of gluon - gluon fusion , while single top production , through @xmath17 fusion , is expected to be much suppressed compared to the mechanism presented in this paper , the reason being that both vertices are electroweak in the process discussed in @xcite , and that operators of dimension five are expected to be suppressed , at least at moderate energies , by some large mass scale . the contribution from dimension",
    "four operators as such has not , to our knowledge , been considered before , although the potential for single top production for measuring the ckm matrix element @xmath18 , has to some extent been analyzed in the past ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "including family mixing and , possibly , @xmath19 violation , the complete set of dimension four effective operators which may contribute to the top effective couplings and are relevant for the present discussion is @xcite @xmath20    and @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 are the left and right projectors , the matrices @xmath24 have family indices only , and the above set is written the non - physical ` weak ' basis ( that is , with matter fields transforming as irreducible representations of the gauge group ) @xcite .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath25 contains the three goldstone bosons associated to the breakdown of the global symmetry @xmath26 down to @xmath27 .",
    "the derivatives appearing in the effective operators are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a weak doublet of matter fields with family indices also .",
    "in addition , one has the following ` universal ' terms @xmath30 { \\rm f }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -{\\rm \\bar{f}}\\left ( u\\left ( \\tau ^{u}\\tilde{y}_{u}^{f}+\\tau ^{d}\\tilde{y}_{d}^{f}\\right ) r+\\left ( \\tau ^{u}\\tilde{y}_{u}^{f\\dagger } + \\tau ^{d}\\tilde{y}_{d}^{f\\dagger } \\right ) u^{\\dagger } l\\right ) { \\rm f } ,   \\label{univer}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are present in the standard model . in eq.([univer ] ) we allow for general couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; in the standard model these couplings can be renormalized away via a change of basis , but in more general theories they leave traces in other operators not present in the standard model@xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that when we diagonalize the mass matrix present in eq .",
    "( [ univer ] ) via a redefinition of the matter fields @xmath33 we change also the structure of operators ( [ effl],[effr ] ) .",
    "taking that into account , the contribution to the different gauge boson - fermion - fermion vertices is as follows @xmath34 z_{\\mu } f   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{e}{s_{w}}\\bar{f}\\gamma ^{\\mu } \\left [ \\left ( d_{l}l+d_{r}r\\right )   \\frac{\\tau ^{-}}{2}w_{\\mu } ^{+}+\\left ( d_{l}^{\\dagger } l+d_{r}^{\\dagger } r\\right ) \\frac{\\tau ^{+}}{2}w_{\\mu } ^{-}\\right ] f ,   \\label{vert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the up and down projectors and @xmath37 represents the matter fields in the physical , diagonal basis .",
    "it can be shown that once the all the renormalization ( vertex , @xmath38 elements , wave - function ) countertems are taken into account @xcite we obtain @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; i.e. we have no contribution from the effective operators to the vertices of the gluon and photon . for the @xmath41 couplings we get instead",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath38 matrix , and the matrices @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s are redefined matrices according to the results of @xcite ( the exact relation of these matrices to the @xmath24 s of eqs .",
    "( [ effl],[effr ] ) has no relevance for the present discussion ) . finally for the charged couplings we have @xmath46    since the set of operators ( [ effl]-[effr ] ) is the most general one allowed by general requirements of gauge invariance , locality and hermiticity ; it is clear that radiative corrections , when expanded in powers of @xmath47 , can be incorporated into them .",
    "in fact , such an approach has proven to be very fruitful in the past .",
    "once everything is included we are allowed to identify the couplings @xmath48 with @xmath49 . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the bounds that the lhc experiments will be able to set on the couplings @xmath49 , more specifically on the entries @xmath50 of these matrices ( those involving the top ) . in the rest of the article we do not consider mixing and we consider non - tree level and new physics contributions only on the @xmath51 effective couplings , therefore in the numerical simulations we have taken @xmath52 when we speak along the paper of the results for the standard model at tree level we mean @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . however , even though numerical results are presented considering only the @xmath51 entry ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , since flavour indices and masses are kept all along in the analytical expressions ( see appendix ) , the appropriate changes to include other entries are immediate .",
    "the effective couplings of the neutral sector ( [ zcoupl ] ) can be determined from the @xmath57 vertex discrepancy with respect to the standard model results , mostly due to the right - handed coupling , remains in the @xmath41 couplings of the @xmath14 quark to this date . ]",
    "@xcite , but at present not much is known from the @xmath51 effective coupling .",
    "this is perhaps best evidenced by the fact that the current experimental results for the ( left - handed ) @xmath18 matrix element give @xcite @xmath58 in the standard model this matrix element is expected to be close to 1 .",
    "it should be emphasized that these are the ` measured ' or ` effective ' values of the ckm matrix elements , and that they do not necessarily correspond , even in the standard model , to the entries of a unitary matrix on account of the presence of radiative corrections .",
    "these deviations with respect to unitary are expected to be small at the few per cent level at most unless new physics is present . at the tevatron",
    "the left - handed couplings are expected to be eventually measured with a 5% accuracy @xcite .",
    "the present work is a contribution to such an analysis in the case of the lhc experiments .",
    "as far as experimental bounds for the right handed effective couplings is concerned , the more stringent ones come at present from the measurements on the @xmath59 decay at cleo @xcite . due to a @xmath60 enhancement of the chirality flipping contribution",
    ", a particular combination of mixing angles and @xmath61 can be found .",
    "the authors of @xcite reach the conclusion that @xmath62 .",
    "however , considering @xmath61 as a matrix in generation space , this bound only constraints the @xmath51 element .",
    "other effective couplings involving the top remain virtually unrestricted from the data .",
    "the previous bound on the right - handed coupling is a very stringent one .",
    "it is pretty obvious that the lhc will not be able to compete with such a bound .",
    "yet , the measurement will be a direct one , not through loop corrections .",
    "equally important is that it will yield information on the @xmath63 and @xmath64 elements too , by just replacing the @xmath65 quark in figs .",
    "[ u+gt+b - d+tot],[d - gt+b - u - tot ] by a @xmath12 or a @xmath66 respectively .",
    "now we shall proceed to analyze the bounds that single top production at the lhc can set on the effective couplings .",
    "this combined with the data from @xmath41 physics will allow an estimation of the six effective couplings ( [ zcoupl]-[vertices ] ) in the matter sector of the effective electroweak lagrangian .",
    "we will , in the present work limit ourselves to the consideration of the cross - sections for production of polarized top quarks .",
    "we shall not consider at this stage the potential of measuring top decays angular distributions in order to establish relevant bounds on the effective electroweak couplings .",
    "this issue merits a more detailed analysis , including the possibility of detecting @xmath19 violation @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the cross section @xmath67 of the process @xmath68 we have used the cteq4 set of structure functions @xcite to determine the probability of extracting a parton with a given fraction of momenta from the proton .",
    "hence we write schematically @xmath69 where @xmath70 denote the parton distribution function ( pdf ) corresponding to the partonic quarks and antiquarks and @xmath71 indicate the pdf corresponding to the gluon . in eq.([pdfs ] ) we have set the light quark and gluon momenta to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "( @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the four - momenta of the two colliding protons . ) the approximation thus involves neglecting the transverse momenta of the incoming partons ; the transverse fluctuations are integrated over by doing the appropriate integrals over @xmath76 .",
    "we have then proceeded as follows .",
    "we have multiplied the parton distribution function of a gluon of a given momenta from the first proton by the sum of parton distribution functions for obtaining a @xmath11 type quark from the second proton .",
    "this result is then multiplied by the cross sections of the subprocesses of fig.[u+gt+b - d+tot ] .",
    "we perform also the analogous process with the @xmath12 type anti - quarks of fig.[d - gt+b - u - tot ] . at the end",
    ", these two partial results are add up to obtain the total @xmath68 cross section .",
    "typically the top quark decays weakly well before strong interactions become relevant , we can in principle measure its polarization state with virtually no contamination of strong interactions ( see e.g. @xcite for discussions this point and section 6 ) . for this reason we have considered polarized cross sections and provide general formulas for the production of polarized tops or anti - tops . to this end",
    "one needs to introduce the spin projector @xmath77 with @xmath78 as the polarization projector for a particle or anti - particle of momentum @xmath79 with spin in the @xmath80 direction .",
    "the calculation of the subprocesses cross sections have been performed for tops and anti - tops polarized in an arbitrary direction @xmath80 .",
    "later we have analyzed numerically different spin frames defined as follows    * lab helicity frame : the polarization vector is taken in the direction of the three momentum of the top or anti - top ( right helicity ) or in the opposite direction ( left helicity ) . *",
    "lab spectator frame : the polarization vector is taken in the direction of the three momentum of the spectator quark jet or in the opposite direction . the spectator quark is the @xmath81-type quark in fig.[u+gt+b - d+tot ] or the @xmath82-type quark in fig.[d - gt+b - u - tot ] . *",
    "rest spectator frame : like in the lab spectator frame we choose the spectator jet to define the polarization of the top or anti - top . here , however , we define @xmath80 as @xmath83 the direction of the three momentum of the spectator quark in the top or anti - top rest frame ( given by a pure boost transformation @xmath84 of the lab frame )",
    ". then we have @xmath85 in that frame and @xmath86 back to the lab frame .    the calculation of the subprocess polarized cross - section we present is completely analytical from beginning to end and the results are given in the appendix .",
    "both the kinematics and the polarization vector of the top ( or anti - top ) are completely general .",
    "since the calculation is of a certain complexity a number of checks have been done to ensure that no mistakes have been made .",
    "the integrated cross section agrees well with the results in @xcite when the same cuts , scale , etc .",
    "the mass of the top is obviously kept , but so is the bottom mass .",
    "the latter in fact turns out to be more relevant than expected as we shall see in a moment .",
    "as we have already discussed , the production of flavours other than @xmath87 in association with the top can be easily derived from our results .    in single top production",
    "a distinction is often made between @xmath88 and @xmath89 processes .",
    "the latter corresponds , in fact , to the processes we have been discussing , the ones represented in fig.[u+gt+b - d+tot ] , in which a gluon from the sea splits into a @xmath14 @xmath65 pair . in the @xmath88 process",
    "the @xmath14 quark is assumed to be extracted from the sea of the proton , and both @xmath14 and @xmath65 are collinear .",
    "of course since the proton has no net @xmath14 content , a @xmath65 quark must be present somewhere in the final state and the distinction between the two processes is purely kinematical .",
    "as is well known , when calculating the total cross section for single top production a logarithmic mass singularity @xcite appears in the total cross section due to the collinear regime where the @xmath14 quark ( and the @xmath65 ) quark have @xmath90 .",
    "this kinematic singularity is actually regulated by the mass of the bottom ; it appears to all orders in perturbation theory and a proper treatment of this singularity requires the use of the altarelli - parisi equations and its resumation into a @xmath14 parton distribution function .",
    "it is thus indistinguishable of the so - called @xmath88 process .",
    "clearly an appropriate cut in @xmath76 should allow us to retain the perturbative regime of the @xmath89 process , while suppressing the @xmath88 one .",
    "two approaches can be used at this point .",
    "one advocated by willenbrock and coworkers @xcite is to focus on the low @xmath91 regime , to minimize the contribution of the @xmath16 background .",
    "one actually is interested in processes where one does not see the @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) quark which is produced in association with the @xmath10 quark ( resp .",
    "@xmath92 ) , and therefore sets an upper cut on the @xmath91 of the @xmath65 . for this one has to take into account the @xmath88 process and , in particular , one must pay attention not to double count the low @xmath91 region ( for the @xmath65 ( or @xmath14 ) quark ) of the @xmath89 process , which is already included via a @xmath14 pdf .",
    "the reason given in @xcite is to separate this single top production process from the dominant @xmath93 , which eventually also produces a @xmath14 and a @xmath65 .",
    "we view this strategy as somewhat risky since , first of all , the separation between the @xmath94 and @xmath88 is not a clear cut one and , on top of that , it is a region where the cross section is rapidly varying so the results do depend on the way the separation is done .",
    "furthermore it relies on assuming that we have a good knowledge of the @xmath14 pdf at that scale ; one will be forced to assume that it behaves largely like the @xmath15 pdf at the end of the day .",
    "on top of that , that strategy does not completely avoid the background originated in @xmath95 production .",
    "that is , when in the decaying @xmath96 the @xmath65 is missed along with the @xmath82-type anti - quark in which case the @xmath81-type quark is taken as the spectator or when the @xmath65 is missed along with the @xmath81-type quark in which case the @xmath82-type anti - quark is taken as the spectator .",
    "on the other hand , measuring the @xmath65 ( or @xmath14 for anti - top production ) momenta will allow a better kinematic reconstruction of the individual processes .",
    "this should allow for a separation from the dominant mechanism of top production through gluon fusion . setting a sufficiently high cut for the jet energy and a good jet separation should be sufficient to avoid contamination from @xmath16 when one hadronic jet is missed . finally , the spin structure of the top is completely different in both cases due to the chiral couplings in electroweak production .",
    "therefore , according to this philosophy stay perturbative , we have implemented a lower cut of 30 gev in the transversal momentum of the @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) in top ( resp",
    ". anti - top ) production .",
    "we shall now present the results of our analysis . to calculate the total event production corresponding to different observables we have used the integrating montecarlo program vegas @xcite .",
    "we present results after one year ( defined as 10@xmath97 seg . )",
    "run at full luminosity in one detector ( 100 @xmath98 at lhc ) .",
    "the total contribution to the electroweak vertices @xmath55 , @xmath99 has two sources : the effective operators parametrizing new physics , and the contribution from the universal radiative corrections . in the standard model , neglecting mixing , for example , we have a tree level contribution to the @xmath100 vertex given by @xmath101 .",
    "radiative corrections ( universal and @xmath102 dependent ) modify @xmath55 and generate a non zero @xmath56 .",
    "these radiative corrections depend weakly on the energy of the process and thus in a first approximation we can take them as constant .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the dependence of different lhc observables on these total effective couplings and how the experimental results can be used to set bounds on them . assuming that the radiative corrections are known , this implies in turn a bound on the coefficients of the effective electroweak lagrangian .",
    "let us start by discussing the experimental cuts .",
    "due to geometrical detector constraints we cut off very low angles for the outgoing particles .",
    "the top , anti - bottom , and spectator quark have to come out with an angle of less than 10 degrees and more than 170 degrees .",
    "these angular cuts correspond to a cut in pseudorapidity @xmath103 . in order to be able to detect the three jets corresponding to the outgoing particles we implements isolation cuts of 20 degrees between each other .",
    "as already discussed we use a lower cut of 30 gev in the @xmath65 jet .",
    "this reduces the cross section to less than one third of its total value , since typically the @xmath65 quark comes out in the same direction as the incoming muon and a large fraction of them do not pass the cut . similarly , @xmath104 gev cuts are set for the top and spectator quark jets .",
    "these cuts guarantee the validity of perturbation theory and will serve to separate from the overwhelming background of low @xmath91 physics .",
    "these values come as a compromise to preserve a good signal , while suppressing unwanted contributions .",
    "they are similar , but not identical to the ones used in @xcite and @xcite . to summarize @xmath105 where @xmath106",
    ", @xmath107 @xmath108 are the polar angles with respect to the beam line of the top , anti - bottom and spectator quark respectively ; @xmath109 , @xmath110 @xmath111 are the angles between top and anti - bottom , top and spectator , and anti - bottom and spectator , respectively .",
    "the momenta conventions are given in figs.[u+gt+b - d+tot]-[u - gt - b+d - tot ] .",
    "numerically , the dominant contribution to the process comes from the diagram where a @xmath14 quark is exchanged in the @xmath10 channel , but a large amount of cancellation takes place with the crossed interference term with the diagram with a top quark in the @xmath10 channel . the smallest contribution ( but obviously non - negligible ) corresponds to this last diagram .",
    "it is then easy to see , given the relative smallness of the @xmath14 mass , why the process is so much forward .",
    "undoubtedly the largest theoretical uncertainty in the whole calculation is the choice of a scale for @xmath112 and the pdf s .",
    "we perform a leading order calculation in qcd and the scale dependence is large . we have made two different choices .",
    "we present some results with the scale @xmath113 used in @xmath112 and the gluon pdf , while the virtuality of the @xmath3 boson is used as scale for the pdf of the light quarks in the proton .",
    "when we use these scales and compute , for instance , the total cross section above a cut of @xmath114 gev in the @xmath65 momentum , we get an excellent agreement with the calculations in @xcite . most of our results are however presented with a common scale @xmath115 , @xmath116 being the center - of - mass energy squared of the @xmath117 subprocess .",
    "the total cross section above the cut is then roughly speaking two thirds of the previous one , but no substantial change in the distributions takes place .",
    "it remains to be seen which one is the correct choice .    from our monte carlo simulation for single top production at the lhc after 1 year of full luminosity and with the cuts given above",
    "we obtain the total number of events .",
    "this number depends on the value of the effective couplings and on the top polarization vector @xmath118 given in the frames defined in section [ cross ] .",
    "if we call @xmath119 to this quantity , we obtain the following results @xmath120 where we have omitted the @xmath121 statistical errors and we have neglected possible @xmath19 phases ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 real ) .",
    "one can observe from the simulations that the production of negative helicity ( left ) tops represents the 69% of the total single top production , this predominance of left tops in the tree level electroweak approximation is expected due to the suppression at high energies of right - handed tops because of the zero right coupling in the charged current sector .",
    "in fact the production of right - handed tops would be zero were it not for the chirality flip , due to the top mass , in the @xmath10-channel .",
    "of course the name ` left ' and ` right ' are a bit misleading ; we really mean negative and positive helicity states .",
    "chirality states can not be used , because the production is peaked in the 200 to 400 gev region for the energy of the top and the mass can not be neglected .",
    "we have also calculated single anti - top production . in fig.[patoptrans_lab_lr_gl=1_gr=0 ] we show the histograms corresponding to the production of @xmath92 with the two possible helicities in the lab frame .",
    "all the histograms correspond to the tree level electroweak approximation and clearly show that single anti - top production is approximately the 75% of single top production .",
    "the same pattern is observed in fig .",
    "[ patoptrans_rep_+-q2_gl=1_gr=0 ] .",
    "this suppression is generated by the parton distribution functions corresponding to negatively charged quarks that are smaller than the ones corresponding to positively charged quarks .",
    "because of that the conclusions for anti - top production are practically the same as the ones for top production taking into account this suppression and that , because of the transformations ( [ change ] ) ( see appendix ) , passing from top to anti - top is equivalent to changing the spin direction .    in fig .",
    "[ costcosb_lab_unpol_gl=1_gr=0 ] we plot the cross section distribution of the polar angles of the top and anti - bottom with respect to the beam line for unpolarized single top production at the lhc . in fig .",
    "[ costopbot_lab_unpol_gl=1_gr=0 ] we plot the distribution of the cosine of the angle between the top and the anti - bottom for unpolarized single top production at the lch .",
    "everything is calculated in the ( tree - level ) standard model in the lab frame . in both figures",
    "the above cuts are implemented , in particular the isolation cut of 20 degrees in the angle between the top and the anti - bottom is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ costopbot_lab_unpol_gl=1_gr=0 ] . from inspection of these figures",
    "two facts emerge : a ) the distribution is strongly peaked in the beam direction as expected .",
    "b ) even with the presence of the isolation cut , near the beam axis configurations with top and anti - bottom almost parallel are favoured with respect to back - to - back configurations .",
    "therefore this is an indication that almost back - to - back configurations are distributed more uniformly in space than parallel configurations favoring the beam line direction .",
    "let us now depart from the tree - level standard model and consider non - zero values for @xmath122 and @xmath123 . .",

    "evidently we do not pretend to make here a serious experimental analysis since we are not taking into account the full set of experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "our aim is just to present and order of magnitude estimate of the sensitivity of the different spin basis to the value of the effective coupling around their tree level standard model value .",
    "the results are given in table [ sensitivity ] , where we indicate also the polarization vector chosen in each case .",
    "of course those sensitivities ( which , as said , are merely indicative ) are calculated with the assumption that one could perfectly measure the top polarization in any of the above basis .",
    "as it is well known the top polarization is only measurable in an indirect way through the angular distribution of its decay products . in section [ decay ]",
    "we outline the procedure to use our results to obtain a final angular distribution for the polarized top decay products ( we believe that some confusion exists on this point ) .",
    "obtaining that angular distribution involves a convolution of the single top production cross section with the decay products angular distribution and because of that we expect the true sensitivity to become worse than the ones given in table [ sensitivity ] .",
    "obviously that true sensitivity must be independent of the spin basis one uses at an intermediate step ( see section [ decay ] ) so the whole discussion as to which is the best basis for the top polarization is academic .",
    "however it may still be useful to know that some basis are more sensitive to the effective couplings than others if one _ assumes _ ( at least as a gedanken experiment ) that the polarization of the top could be measured directly .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the bottom mass , which appears in the cross section in crossed left - right terms , such as @xmath124 , plays a crucial role in the actual determination of @xmath56 .",

    "however if both effective couplings are non - vanishing we would have a quotient @xmath158 that would depend in general on the kinematics .",
    "this is not possible so we can conclude that for a non - vanishing @xmath56 ( @xmath55 is evidently non - vanishing ) it is not possible to have a pure spin state ( or , else , only for fine tuned @xmath56 a 100% polarization is possible ) .    to illustrate these considerations let us give an example : in the unphysical situation where @xmath159 it can be shown that there exists two solutions to the saturated constraint ( [ constr1 ] ) , namely @xmath160 once we have found this result we plug it in the expression ( [ 100 ] ) and we find the solutions @xmath161 with @xmath55 arbitrary for the @xmath162 sign and @xmath163 with @xmath56 arbitrary for the @xmath164 sign .",
    "that is , physically we have zero probability of producing a right handed top when we have only a left handed coupling and viceversa when we have only a right handed coupling . note",
    "that in this case it is clear that having both effective couplings non - vanishing would imply the absence of 100 % polarization in any spin basis .",
    "this can be understood in general remembering that the top particle forms in general an entangled state with the other particles of the process .",
    "since we are tracing over the unknown spin degrees of freedom and over the flavors of the spectator quark we do not expect in general to end up with a top in a pure polarized state ; although this is not impossible as it is shown the in the last example .    in the physical situation",
    "where @xmath165 ( we use @xmath166 gev . and @xmath167 gev . in this paper ) we have found that a spin basis with relatively high polarization is the one with the spin @xmath80 taken in the direction of the spectator quark in the top rest frame .",
    "this is in accordance to the results in @xcite . in general the degree of polarization ( @xmath168 )",
    "depends not only on the spin frame but also on the particular cuts chosen .",
    "we have found that the lower cut for the transverse momentum of the bottom worsens the polarization degree but , in spite of that , from eq.([results ] ) we see that we have a 84% of polarization in the standard model ( @xmath169 @xmath54 ) that is much bigger than the 69% obtained with the helicity frame . the above results follow the general trend of those presented by mahlon and parke @xcite , but in general , their degree of polarization is higher .",
    "we understand that this is due to the different cuts ( in particular for the transversal momentum of the bottom ) along with the different set of pdf s used in our simulations .",
    "a well know result in the tree level sm regarding the measure of the top polarization from its decay products is the formula that states the following : given a top polarized in the @xmath80 direction in its rest frame , the lepton @xmath170 produced in the decay of the top via the process @xmath171 presents an angular distribution @xcite    @xmath172    where @xmath154 is a normalization factor and @xmath173 is the axial angle measured from the direction of @xmath174 what can we do when the top is in a mixed state with no 100% polarization in any direction ?",
    "the first naive answer would be : with any axis @xmath80 in the top rest frame the top will have a polarization @xmath175 ( with @xmath176 in that direction and a polarization @xmath177 in the opposite direction so the angular distribution for the lepton is @xmath178 the problem with formula ( [ pol ] ) is that the angular distribution for the lepton depends on the arbitrary chosen axis @xmath80 and this can not be correct .",
    "the correct answer can be obtained by noting the following facts :    * given an arbitrary chosen axis @xmath80 in the rest frame and the associated spin basis to it @xmath179 the top spin state in given by a @xmath180 density matrix @xmath181 @xmath182 which is in general not diagonal ( @xmath183 ) and whose coefficients depend on the rest of kinematical variables determining the differential cross section .",

    "we only know _ the diagonal elements @xmath184 * given @xmath181 in any orthogonal basis determined ( up to phases ) by @xmath80 we can change to another basis that diagonalizes @xmath185 since the top is a spin @xmath186 particle , this basis will correspond to another direction @xmath187 .",
    "* once we have @xmath181 diagonalized then eq.([pol ] ) is trivially correct with @xmath188 and now @xmath173 is unambiguously measured from the direction of @xmath189    from the above facts the first question that comes to our minds is if there exists a way to determine @xmath187 without knowing the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath185 the answer is yes .",
    "it is an easy exercise of elementary quantum mechanics that given a @xmath180 hermitian matrix @xmath190 the eigenvector with largest ( lowest ) eigenvalue correspond to the unitary vector that maximizes ( minimizes ) the bilinear form @xmath191 constrained to @xmath192 .",
    "since an arbitrary normalized @xmath193 can be written ( up to phases ) as @xmath194 and in that case @xmath195 then the correct @xmath187 entering in eq.([pol ] ) is the one that maximizes the differential cross section @xmath196 for each kinematical configuration . at the end",

    "taking into account the above comment and that @xmath200 depends on @xmath55 and @xmath56 we see that also @xmath201 depends on @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "is presented for an arbitrary choice of the spin basis @xmath202 in the top rest frame .",
    "this is incorrect because it does not take into account that , in general , the top spin density matrix is not diagonal . * in a recent work @xcite @xmath203 corrections are incorporated to the polarized top decay angular analysis . in this work the density matrix for the top spin is properly taken into account . to connect this work with ours we have to replace their polarization vector @xmath204 by @xmath205 where the magnitude of the top polarization @xmath206 is just the spin asymmetry @xmath207 in our language",
    "this taken into account , the density matrix the authors of @xcite quote is in the basis @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a normal vector in the direction of the three momentum of the @xmath13 ( in the top rest frame ) .",
    "we have done a complete calculation of the subprocess cross sections for polarized tops or anti - tops including the right effective coupling and bottom mass corrections .",
    "we have used a @xmath210 gev .",

    "we use the most general set of couplings and , since our approach is completely analytical , we can describe the contribution from other intermediate quarks in the @xmath10 channel , mixing , etc . masses and mixing angles are retained . on the contrary",
    ", the analysis has to be considered only preliminary from an experimental point of view .",
    "no detailed study of the backgrounds has been made , except for the dominant @xmath211 process which has been considered to some extent ( although again without quantitative evaluation ) .",
    "given the ( presumed ) smallness of the right handed couplings , the bottom mass plays a role which is more important than anticipated , as the mixed crossed @xmath212 term , which actually is the most sensitive one to @xmath99 is accompanied by a @xmath14 quark mass .",
    "the statistical sensitivity to different values of this coupling is given in the text .",
    "we present a variety of @xmath91 and angular distributions both for the @xmath10 and the @xmath65 quarks .",
    "obviously , the top decays shortly after production , but we have not made detailed simulations of this part .",
    "in fact , the interest of this decay is obvious : one can measure the spin of the top through the angular distribution of the leptons produced in this decay . in the standard model",
    ", single top production gives a high degree of polarization ( 84 % in the optimal basis , with the present set of cuts ) .",
    "this is a high degree of polarization , but well below the 90 + claimed by mahlon and parke in @xcite .",
    "we understand this being due to the presence of the 30 gev . cut .",
    "in fact , if we remove this cut completely we get a 91 % polarization . still below the result of @xcite but in rough agreement",
    "( note that we do not include the @xmath88 process ) .",
    "inasmuch as they can be compared our results are in good agreement with those presented in @xcite in what concerns the total cross - section .",
    "two different choices for the strong scale @xmath213 are presented .",
    "in addition , it turns out that when @xmath197 the top can never be 100% polarized .",
    "in other words , it is in a mixed state . in this case",
    "we show that a unique spin basis is singled out which allows one to connect top decay products angular distribution with the polarized top differential cross section .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that a previous study for this process in the present context was performed by the present authors@xcite using the effective w approximation@xcite , in which the @xmath3 is treated as a parton of the proton . while this is certainly not an exact treatment , it is expected to be sufficiently good for our purposes . in the course of this work we have found , however , a number of interesting differences .",

    "<S> we study the mechanism of single top production at the lhc in the framework of an effective electroweak lagrangian , analyzing the sensitivity of different observables to the magnitude of the effective couplings that parametrize new physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the observables relevant to the distinction between left and right effective couplings involve in practice the measurement of the spin of the top and this can be achieved only indirectly by measuring the angular distribution of its decay products . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of effective right - handed couplings implies that the top is not in a pure spin state . </S>",
    "<S> a unique spin basis is singled out which allows one to connect top decay products angular distribution with the polarized top differential cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we present a complete analytical expression of the differential polarized cross section of the relevant perturbative subprocess including general effective couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the bottom quark , which actually turns out to be more relevant than naively expected , is retained . </S>",
    "<S> finally we analyze different aspects the total cross section relevant to the measurement of new physics through the effective couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis also applies to anti - top production in a straightforward way .    </S>",
