    "a little hyperbolic trigonometry shows ( with the edge length labels from the figure ) that @xmath69 , so the triod is shorter",
    ". one can apply this procedure to a pair of geodesic edges that share an endpoint in a carrier graph .",
    "generally , such a pair of edges will not be the same length , so we instead apply it to two `` edge segments '' ( i.e. a subarc of an edge ) .",

    "<S> we show that if @xmath0 is a minimal length carrier graph in a hyperbolic 3-manifold , @xmath1 , then if @xmath0 contains a sufficiently short edge , it must contain a short circuit , as well . </S>",
    "<S> the meaning of `` short '' depends only on the rank of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also expand the class of manifolds which are known to have minimal length carrier graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> carrier graphs were introduced as a tool to study hyperbolic 3-manifolds by matthew white in  @xcite , where he proved that an upper bound on the rank of @xmath3 of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold gives an upper bound on its minimal injectivity radius . </S>",
    "<S> they were later used by souto in  @xcite and then biringer in  @xcite to show that the rank of @xmath3 equals the heegaard genus for large classes of 3-manifolds fibering over the circle . </S>",
    "<S> namazi and souto used carrier graphs to prove that rank equals genus for two handlebodies glued together via a sufficiently large power of a pseudo - anosov map  ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> biringer and souto also used them to prove that there are only finitely many closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with a given upper bound on rank and lower bounds on injectivity radius and first eigenvalue of the laplacian  ( @xcite ) .    despite this interest in carrier graphs , relatively little is known about their apparently very nice geometry . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , there does not seem to be a single concrete example of a minimal length carrier graph in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> it seems likely that a more thorough understanding of their geometry would yield more results about hyperbolic 3-manifolds , especially regarding their rank . </S>",
    "<S> our main result , theorem  [ main ] , says roughly that for a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath1 with , if a minimal length carrier graph has a very short edge , then the graph must have a short circuit . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we show    suppose @xmath1 is a hyperbolic 3-manifold and @xmath4 is a minimal length carrier graph . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath5 and assume @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for every @xmath7 , there exists @xmath8 such that if every circuit in @xmath0 has length greater than @xmath9 , then every edge in @xmath0 has length at least @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath10 depends only on @xmath9 and @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we emphasize that such an @xmath10 can be defined explicitly in terms of @xmath9 .    in section  [ prelim ] , </S>",
    "<S> we give basic definitions and lemmas regarding carrier graphs . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a theorem generalizing white s result in  @xcite that closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds have minimal length carrier graphs . in section  [ main - section ] , we prove theorem  [ main ] , which has as an immediate corollary that a lower bound on the injectivity radius of @xmath1 gives a lower bound on the length of any edge in a minimal length carrier graph for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section  [ example ] , we give an example to show that the main result is stronger than this corollary .    * acknowledgements . </S>",
    "<S> * the author appreciates the feedback received from daniel groves , jason deblois and the referee . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the author gratefully acknowledges ian agol , ian biringer , and juan souto , for each independently providing the example in section  [ example ] . </S>",
    "<S> the author is especially grateful for the help and guidance provided by his thesis advisor , peter shalen . </S>"
