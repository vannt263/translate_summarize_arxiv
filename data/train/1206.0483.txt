    "after the discovery of hr 8799 bcd ( @xmath5 @xmath4 24 , 38 , and 68 au ) reported in november 2008 @xcite , other studies identified at least one of these planets in archival data taken prior to 2008 @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 planet astrometry derived from both pre and post - discovery images can help constrain the system s dynamical stability and , in turn , the planets physical properties .",
    "at least two of the hr 8799 planets are likely locked in a mean motion resonance , otherwise the system would quickly become dynamically unstable @xcite . the recently discovered fourth companion at @xmath6 15 au , hr 8799 e , generally makes dynamical stability less likely @xcite , favoring lower masses of @xmath7 @xmath8 7 , 10 @xmath9 , an important constraint given the uncertainties in deriving masses from planet cooling and atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "studies focused on fitting the planets orbits and/or testing dynamical stability typically assume that the planets are a ) in resonance ( 4:2:1 for hr 8799 bcd or 2:1 for hr 8799 cd ) , b ) in circular , face - on orbits , c ) and/or in coplanar orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* see also fabrycky and murray - clay 2010 ) .",
    "however , @xcite show that circular , face - on , and coplanar orbits are inconsistent with 1998 hst astrometry , identifying a best - fit orbit for hr 8799 d of @xmath10 = 28@xmath1 and @xmath11 = 0.115 .",
    "generally , more eccentric orbits destabilize the system .",
    "the system stability depends on the ( mutual ) inclinations of the planets @xcite .",
    "thus , the hr 8799 planets true mass limits derived from dynamical stability arguments may slightly differ from those previously reported .",
    "well - sampled hr 8799 d astrometry could help clarify whether hr 8799 d s orbit must be inclined , eccentric , and/or coplanar with the other planets .",

    "the seeing conditions fluctuated and the observers periodically recentered the star behind the mask , changing the intensity profile of the stellar halo ( and thus the quasi - static speckle pattern ) . during a few frames near transit",
    "the star did not properly center at all behind the coronagraph .",
    "we identify @xmath6 11 minutes of science - grade data .",

    "to improve the signal - to - noise of our hr 8799 d detection , we incorporated several upgrades to enhance contrast which are being implemented in a new  adaptive \" loci ( a - loci ) pipeline ( t. currie , 2012 in prep . ;",
    "see also similar steps in marois et al .",
    "we subtract off the seeing halo in each image to measure the static / quasi - static speckle pattern , determining the cross - correlation function for the speckle patterns in annular sections for all possible image pairs .",
    "while the speckle pattern is generally better correlated between frames taken close together in time , this is not always the case , especially when comparing frames before and after small telescope nods . therefore ,",
    "for each annular section of a science image we want to subtract , we filter reference image sections by their degree of correlation to remove those below a certain , predetermined threshold ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "hr 8799 b is detectable in most individual processed frames ( snr / frame @xmath6 47 ) , so we measure its position to identify and correct for any astrometric biases caused by a pa  jump \" for frames obtained near transit due to imperfect mechanical alignment of the telescope s @xmath16 axis . the position angles of hr 8799 b in frames more than 0.25 hours from transit are consistent , but the pa offset follows a bell - shaped curve with a maximum offset of @xmath4 0.6 degrees centered on transit .",
    "we model and correct for this offset using a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "we also reran our pipeline with different rotation axis offsets due to image registration errors , setting an upper limit to this of 0.5 pixels in each coordinate .",
    "furthermore , unlike the original loci algorithm , we set the azimuthal length of the subtraction zone to be smaller ( not identical ) to the azimuthal length for the optimization zone , equal to @xmath17 ( the length along the radial direction ) .",

    "we calibrate our astrometry by assessing and correcting for biases introduced by loci - based processing in the same manner as our photometric calibration , using fake point sources .",
    "using different telescopes and slightly different image processing techniques lead to systematic biases in planet astrometry . to minimize these biases ,",

    ", we consider the orbits separately .",
    "dynamical stability analysis suggests that hr 8799 bcd are likely in resonance @xcite ; the 4:2:1 resonance is particularly adept at stabilizing the system . to focus on dynamically stable orbits",
    "we then select the subset of best - fitting orbits that preclude the planets from crossing orbits and are consistent with a 4:2:1 resonance . here",
    "we define  resonance \" broadly , including orbits with ratios of periods between 1.9 and 2.1 for consecutive pairs of planets since , at least in some circumstances , _ exact _ period ratios may be rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for all our simulations , the minimum @xmath29 for the b , c , and d planets",
    "are 20.8 , 13.8 , and 14.8 , for reduced @xmath30 values of 1.04 , 0.86 , and 1.24 .",
    "following @xcite , we choose a cutoff of @xmath29 @xmath31 @xmath32 + 1 to represent the family of best - fitting orbits .",
    "formally , this cutoff admits only an average additional deviation per each x or y measurement of @xmath4 1/2@xmath33 ( i.e. @xmath4 1/20 for hr 8799 b ; @xmath4 1/14 for hr 8799 d ) beyond the best - fit models which themselves imply typical deviations of @xmath4 1-@xmath25 per each x or y measurement ( since the minimum reduced @xmath34 values are @xmath4 1 ) .",
    "however , we obtain nearly identical results for more relaxed cutoffs ( see below ) . from the set of models passing our @xmath29 cutoff , including the subset in resonance , we determine the weighted median value and the weighted 68% confidence interval about the median for each model parameter from amongst the set of best - fitting orbits .",
    "furthermore , we report a  _ most likely orbit _ \" ( mlo ) simply defined as follows .",
    "first , over the best - fitting family of orbits , we calculate histograms for the following parameters : logarithm of the semi - major axis ( @xmath35 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath36 ) , inclination ( @xmath37 ) , longitude of ascending node ( @xmath38 ) , and argument of periastron ( @xmath39 ) . for each orbit",
    "@xmath40 in the best - fitting ensemble , we then define the measure of likelihood @xmath41 as @xmath42 i.e. ,  the product of all histograms values in the bins in which the orbit @xmath40 lies , representing the individual likelihood of each measured orbital parameter , as well as the statistical weight , @xmath43 , representing the likelihood of the observed planet position within the orbit ( i.e. ,  the anomaly ) is defined as the mean orbital velocity for the corresponding orbit divided by the orbital velocity at the observed epoch , @xmath44 . ] .",
    "the most likely orbit is then the one orbit that maximizes the measure of likelihood , @xmath45 . because of the highly skewed distribution of some parameters from the best - fit orbits , in particular @xmath46",
    ", the mlo parameters can differ significantly from the weighted median parameters .",
    "table 1 summarizes our results , and figure [ astrom_all ] displays the orbits in @xmath47/@xmath10/@xmath11 space ( left ) , the histogram distribution of @xmath10 ( middle ) , and the histogram distribution of the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath48 ( right ) .",
    "the top panels display properties for hr 8799 b , the middle for hr 8799 c , and the bottom for hr 8799 d. assuming a @xmath29 cutoff of @xmath32 + 1 , the observations well constrain the hr 8799 d orbit ",
    "@xmath47 @xmath6 2432 au , @xmath10 @xmath6 3242@xmath13 , @xmath11 @xmath6 0.030.23 , and @xmath48 @xmath6 4363@xmath13 .",
    "they limit the hr 8799 c s most plausible orbital parameters to @xmath47 @xmath6 3642 au , @xmath10 @xmath6 1326@xmath13 , and @xmath11 @xmath6 0.030.13 .",
    "as expected , the parameters for hr 8799 b are the most poorly constrained , showing the widest dispersion and the largest differences between the median parameter value and that from the mlo .",
    "our analysis clearly disfavors face - on orbits for all three planets , especially for hr 8799 c and d. additionally , the inclination distributions for hr 8799 bc appear systematically skewed towards values lower than those for d. formally , though , the set of acceptably - fitting orbits hr 8799 bcd include some that make the planets coplanar .",
    "assuming a 4:2:1 mean - motion resonance configuration , we place far stronger limits on nearly all of the hr 8799 bcd orbital properties ( figure [ astrom_res ] ) .",
    "this assumption explicitly rules out @xmath11 @xmath49 0.18 for hr 8799 bc and @xmath11 @xmath49 0.3 for hr 8799 d. likewise , we identify a very narrow range of planet semimajor axes : @xmath47 = 67.570.8 au , 42.144.4 au , and 26.428.1 au for hr 8799 b , c , and d. the 68% confidence interval in @xmath48 for hr 8799 d further narrows to 46@xmath162@xmath1 .    for this configuration , hr 8799 d ( c ) must be in an orbit viewed more than 25@xmath1 ( 15@xmath1 ) from face - on while hr 8799 b is likely inclined by at least 5@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the inclination distributions between hr 8799 d and hr 8799 bc are even more dissimilar , implying that hr 8799 d is most likely inclined relative to c by at least @xmath4 7@xmath1 and b by more than @xmath4 21@xmath1 .",
    "while our analyses can not conclusively rule out coplanar orbits in a 4:2:1 mean - motion resonance , they suggest that few such orbits are compatible with 12 years of hr 8799 planet astrometry .    to confirm that we are fully sampling the subset of orbital parameters covering the @xmath29 minima , we run our simulations with a more relaxed @xmath29 cutoff of @xmath29 @xmath31 @xmath32 + [ 5 , 5 , 3.5 ] for hr 8799 b , c , and d , which formally admit an additional average deviation from the data of @xmath4 0.3-@xmath25 for each measurement .",
    "with this cutoff , we obtain nearly identical results ( second set of rows in table 1 ) .",
    "considering the planets orbits separately , we find @xmath47 @xmath6 2331 au , @xmath10 @xmath6 2741@xmath1 , @xmath11 @xmath6 0.010.31 , and @xmath48 @xmath6 4153@xmath1 for hr 8799d .",
    "we find similar ranges in orbital parameters for hr 8799 c and ( for the resonance case ) hr 8799 b. likewise , the planets range of inclinations exclude face - on orbits .",
    "hr 8799 d s inclination distribution is skewed to systematically higher values , expected if it is non - coplanar with b and c , although here there are more orbit combinations that could make the planets coplanar .",
    "from analyzing hr 8799 bcd astrometry from our new ",
    "pre - discovery \" image and other data , we provide new constraints on the planets orbital properties . treating the three planets separately",
    ", we narrowly constrain three major orbital parameters ( @xmath47/@xmath10/@xmath11 ) for hr 8799 c and d. none of the planets are likely to be orbiting face - on and the inclinations for acceptably - fitting orbits are systematically higher for hr 8799 d than for hr 8799 b and c.    if hr 8799 bcd have semimajor axes consistent with a 4:2:1 resonance , our analysis strongly constrains the major orbital properties for all three planets .",
    "the three planets ( especially c and d ) then even more obviously have inclined orbits .",
    "most acceptable solutions for hr 8799 d place the planet on an orbit inclined by more than 7@xmath1 ( 21@xmath1 ) relative to hr 8799 b(c ) s orbit : few orbital solutions consistent with the astrometry also place them on coplanar orbits . adopting a less restrictive definition for  acceptably - fitting \" orbits does not undo any of these trends , although there are more orbit combinations making the planets coplanar . adopting the median parameter value or mlo instead of the more conservative 68% confidence interval likewise",
    "does not change these results .",
    "these results provide valuable input for constraining the mass of the hr 8799 planetary system .",
    "longer - term astrometric monitoring of hr 8799 ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will better clarify the planets orbital properties .",
    "limits on the planets dynamical masses will provide crucial input for planet cooling models and even more firmly establish hr 8799 as a benchmark system to understand the properties of young , self - luminous planets .",
    "finally , this work and other recent studies of hr 8799 @xcite clearly demonstrate the value of publicly archiving data on advanced telescopes . in our case , detecting at least two hr 8799 planets ( hr 8799 bc ) was rather straightforward and did not require advanced image processing techniques developed well after the data were taken . as data for keck and many other 810 m class telescopes",

    "<S> we present previously unpublished july 2005 @xmath0-band coronagraphic data of the young , planet - hosting star hr 8799 from the newly - released keck / nirc2 archive . despite poor observing conditions , we detect three of the planets ( hr 8799 bcd ) , two of them ( hr 8799 bc ) without advanced image processing . </S>",
    "<S> comparing these data with previously published 1998 - 2011 astrometry and that from re - reduced october 2010 keck data constrains the orbits of the planets . analyzing the planets astrometry separately , </S>",
    "<S> hr 8799 d s orbit is likely inclined at least 25@xmath1 from face - on and the others may be on in inclined orbits . for semimajor axis ratios consistent with a 4:2:1 mean - motion resonance , </S>",
    "<S> our analysis yields precise values for hr 8799 bcd s orbital parameters and strictly constrains the planets eccentricities to be less than 0.180.3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find no acceptable orbital solutions with this resonance that place the planets in face - on orbits ; hr 8799 d shows the largest deviation from such orbits . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , few orbits make hr 8799 d coplanar with b and c , whereas dynamical stability analyses used to constrain the planets masses typically assume coplanar and/or face - on orbits . </S>",
    "<S> this paper illustrates the significant science gain enabled with the release of the nirc2 archive . </S>"
