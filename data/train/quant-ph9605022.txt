    "there are many processes in physics which can be described in terms of a sequence of steps .",
    "the computation process furnishes many examples .",
    "each computer program is a collection of elementary steps which the physical system ( computer ) undergoes .",
    "computation using a program on a given input consists of iteration of the program steps where the particular elementary steps carried out at the n+1st iteration depend on the system state and the available elementary steps .",
    "each elementary step is local in the sense that changes in a space region depend on conditions in the region and not on far distant conditions .",
    "each computation by a given program on a specified input yields a sequence or path of distinct computation states . a computation state is a complete global specification of the states of all relevant degrees of freedom of the system carrying out the computation . for a turing machine",
    "a computation state specifies the string of bits or numbers on the computation tape and the internal state and position of the scanning head . for networks of gates",
    "a computation state is a complete specification of the states of the systems moving in the wires and the states of the gates in the network .",
    "the collection of all paths generated by the given program acting on all possible inputs is a collection of finite and infinite paths of computation states .",
    "the collection of paths depends on the computer program being considered as it is different for different programs . in many computational models , paths representing halting or nonhalting computations are finite or infinite respectively . in other models",
    "all paths are infinite with halting computations specified by a system flag .",
    "as is well known @xcite computations can be reversible or irreversible .",
    "irreversible computations are those for which each computation state has at most one successor but may have more than one predecessor .",
    "computation states in reversible computations have at most one successor and one predecessor .",
    "since the interest here is in hamiltonian models of process such as computation , consideration is limited to reversible computations only . as bennett @xcite has shown ,",
    "this is not a limitation in that for each turing machine computation ( reversible or irreversible ) there is an equivalent reversible computation which is slower and has more relevant degrees of freedom ( history and copying degrees ) than the original computation .",
    "this work , which showed that computation could be performed by reversible or information preserving steps only , along with that of landauer @xcite formed the basis for early work @xcite on quantum mechanical hamiltonian models of computers as turing machines .",
    "this work , along with that of feynman @xcite and deutsch @xcite , formed the basis for the recent blossoming of the field .",
    "recent work includes that of lloyd on the halting problem for quantum computers @xcite , and lloyd @xcite and divincenzo @xcite and others @xcite on the universality of 2-bit quantum gates for quantum circuit computation .",
    "the work of shor @xcite , showing that the integer factoring problem could be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer , has provided much of the impetus for the recent work .",
    "work has also been proceeding on developing physical models of quantum computers . as is well known proper functioning of a quantum computer requires that phase relations be maintained between the component states of all the degrees of freedom in the model .",
    "landauer @xcite has repeatedly emphasized the problem of physical realization of quantum computation in that environmental noise and decoherence cause degradation of performance",
    ". additional work on the effects of decoherence on quantum computation has been done by unruh @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "recent work on quantum error correcting codes @xcite gives hope that the effects of noise and decoherence can be minimized .",
    "it is also clear that it is advantageous to minimize the number of degrees of freedom needed to carry out a quantum computation since fewer degrees involved means less effort is needed to minimize environmental influences .",
    "the work of this paper is based on a translation of step processes such as reversible computation into quantum mechanics . to each process",
    "is associated a bounded linear operator @xmath0 , called a `` step operator '' for the process such that iteration of powers of @xmath0 ( or its adjoint @xmath1 model successive steps forward ( or backward ) of the process .",
    "note that no association of a finite time interval with a step is assumed . as",
    "a result step operators can be used directly in the construction of hamiltonians .",
    "additional discussion is provided in the sext section .",
    "the states of the model process system can be represented as states in some basis .",
    "for the purposes of this paper it is not necessary that @xmath0 be equal to a sum of elementary step operators .",
    "however , if the process consists of a set of elementary steps , such as a model of a computer program , then it is useful to write @xmath0 as a sum of corresponding elementary step operators .",
    "the procedure used here differs from that used by deutsch @xcite and bernstein and vazirani @xcite in their description of quantum computation .",
    "they assumed that the step operator is unitary , spatially local , and associated with a finite time interval . in this case",
    "a hamiltonian can be defined by @xmath2 .    because of problems with this approach , such as the nonexistence of a hamiltonian which is simple and local , this approach is not used here .",
    "instead a step operator @xmath0 for a process such as quantum computation is associated with an infinitesimal time interval . as a result , it can be used to construct a hamiltonian @xmath3 which describes the unitary time evolution of the process .",
    "the hamiltonian is time independent , selfadjoint , and has the complexity of @xmath0 and not of all steps of the process .",
    "the step operator @xmath0 associated with a process need not be unitary , selfadjoint , or even normal .",
    "more details on a comparison between this approach and that of deutsch and bernstein and vazirani @xcite will be discussed later on .    in earlier work @xcite unitary step operators for quantum turing machines were constructed .",
    "however the work was limited to deterministic computations only .",
    "in addition the unitarity was artificial in that it held only for the subspace of states defined by all iterations of the step operator and its adjoint .",
    "in general ( e.g. for universal machines ) this subspace can not be defined effectively . also on the larger space of all states ( which can be effectively defined )",
    "the step operator was not unitary and its properties on the larger space were not considered .    in this paper much attention",
    "is given to conditions that a step operator @xmath0 must satisfy such that iteration of @xmath0 or its adjoint on the states in some basis generates a collection of paths in the basis .",
    "a path is a finite or infinite sequence of distinct states in a basis .",
    "a basis is a set of pairwise orthogonal , normalized states which span a hilbert space .",
    "the idea is that if the model process system is in any state in a path , then successive states in the path represent successive steps of the process .",
    "an additional requirement is that the model process step operator be distinct path generating in some basis .",
    "this follows the restriction made for reversible classical computations @xcite .",
    "this means that if the process is started on different input states , the paths generated by successive steps of the process must be distinct and have no overlap .",
    "otherwise computations started on distinct inputs would overlap and one would not know which input was associated with the output .    in general an arbitrary operator as a candidate model step operator",
    "may not have any of these desired properties .",
    "iteration of the operator may not generate a path in any basis in that orthogonality of states is not preserved under iteration . or the operator may generate paths which branch and join into a network of interconnected paths in all bases . note",
    "that in order to ensure that no paths join or branch it is necessary that the states in all the paths be in the same basis .",
    "for example if each of two different paths were in different bases , then the overlap of states in the different bases would destroy the distinctness of the paths .",
    "if there were no overlap between the states in the two paths , then another basis , which includes the states in both of the paths , would be a suitable basis for the requirement of distinct path generation .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give necessary and sufficient conditions that an arbitrary model process step operator must have in order that there exist a quantum mechanical hamiltonian which describes quantum ballistic evolution of the process .",
    "quantum ballistic evolution refers to the `` motion '' of the model process system along paths of states and is limited to step operators which are distinct path generating .",
    "the paths are defined by iteration of the process step operator or its adjoint on states in the basis . under this type of evolution any wave packet of states on a path",
    "moves along the path , spreading out as it moves .",
    "it is important to note that full advantage is taken here of the fact that in quantum mechanics there exist many inequivalent basis sets . in classical mechanics",
    "there is only one . in particular nondeterministic computations , which allow arbitrary bit transformations ( such as @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) , and",
    "deterministic computations , which limit bit transformations to @xmath6 only , are included .",
    "this is done by allowing basis sets , with respect to which the paths are defined and quantum ballistic evolution occurs , to be arbitrarily complex with entanglements between the component model systems .",
    "another goal of this paper is to determine if there exists an effective decision procedure to decide if a model step operator for an arbitrary process is distinct path generating and thus if a hamiltonian description of quantum ballistic evolution exists .",
    "it will be seen that in general such a decision procedure does not exist .",
    "however , for models of computation , this problem exists only for nondeterministic computations .",
    "an effective decision procedure is shown to exist for deterministic models .    in the next section",
    "there is more discussion on paths , distinct path generation by process step operators , and quantum ballistic evolution for partial isometries .",
    "feynman s prescription @xcite of construction of a hamiltonian from process step operators is introduced .    in section [ ipo ] definitions of stability and orthogonality preserving for operators",
    "are introduced .",
    "some theorems are stated and proved including the result that stability plus orthogonality preservation are equivalent to distinct path generation .",
    "section [ ppi ] introduces power partial isometries and gives some of their main properties of interest here .",
    "the equivalence between complete orthogonality preservation and power partial isometry is proved .",
    "section [ main ] contains the main result .",
    "it is proved that necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a hamiltonian description of quantum ballistic evolution on some basis for a process step operator @xmath0 is that @xmath0 is a partial isometry which is orthogonality preserving and stable .",
    "canonical eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given for the feynman hamiltonian ( eq . [ ham ] ) .",
    "sections [ examples ] and [ qctm ] give illustrative examples and a definition of the step operators for turing machine models of quantum computation .",
    "the existence of nondeterministic quantum turing machines which evolve quantum ballistically is shown by explicit example construction .",
    "following is a discussion of effective determination of the existence of a hamiltonian description of quantum ballistic evolution for a process with associated step operator @xmath0 .",
    "some other aspects , including a discussion of the approach used here and that of deutsch and bernstein and vazirani @xcite , are included in section [ discussion ] .",
    "as noted the interest here is in step operators @xmath0 which are distinct path generating . that is +   + * definition 1 * _ a step operator @xmath0 and its adjoint are _ distinct path generating on a basis @xmath7 _ if iterations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , started at any state in @xmath7 , generate paths in @xmath7 that are distinct in that they do not intersect or join one another . _",
    "+   + in more precise terms this definition means that @xmath0 and its adjoint are distinct path generating if for all states @xmath8 in a basis @xmath7 , if @xmath9 , then there exists a unique state @xmath10 in @xmath7 such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a similar statement holds with @xmath1 replacing @xmath0 .",
    "note that distinct path generation is defined here for norm preserving motion only . in future work",
    "this restriction will be removed from the definition by allowing @xmath13 where @xmath14 can be different from @xmath15 .",
    "the purpose of this definition is to get rid of paths which join , branch or intersect .",
    "note that paths of @xmath16 length are included .",
    "( i.e. for some @xmath17 ) .",
    "also it is clear that any @xmath0 satisfying the definition is a partial isometry .",
    "an operator is a partial isometry if both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are projection operators .",
    "step operators @xmath0 which are distinct path generating on some basis can be used to model the evolution of some system whose elementary steps are modelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the adjoint is used instead of the inverse as @xmath0 may not have an inverse .",
    "a state of the system on a path consists of a wave packet of states on a path .",
    "in general such a wave packet has the form @xmath20 the time development is shown in eq .",
    "[ packet ] by the explicit time dependence of the coefficients @xmath21 .",
    "quantum ballistic evolution refers to the time evolution of such packets along distinct paths in some basis .",
    "as these packets move under the action of some hamiltonian they spread out along the paths . if a path is two way infinite , @xmath22 , motion continues with no momentum change .",
    "if a path is infinite in one direction only reflection occurs at the path end .",
    "if the path is finite with distinct ends , reflection occurs at both ends . for cyclic paths the packet moves around the cycle with interference occurring as the packet spreads over a distance greater than one cycle .",
    "additional details on the packet spreading are given in @xcite .",
    "a very simple example of quantum ballistic evolution would be free system motion in a collection of quantum wires , which do not intersect , branch or join , on a three dimensional space lattice .",
    "this includes straight or curved lines or line segments , closed loops such as circles , chains of closed loops , etc .. for this example the basis @xmath7 is the set @xmath23 of position vectors on the lattice . in this paper",
    "the basis set is not fixed in advance , and the character of @xmath7 on which quantum ballistic evolution occurs , if it is possible , is determined by the properties of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "a schematic representation of wave packets on infinite paths is shown in figure 1 . here the states in some basis are represented as points in space .",
    "two paths , shown by dotted lines are shown .",
    "path a is nonterminating and path b has a terminus t. two wave packets , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shown .",
    "for each the time dependent coefficients are represented schematically by @xmath26 .",
    "the basis state dependence of the coefficients is also indicated .",
    "quantum ballistic evolution can also be used to describe motion for an initial state which is a linear superposition of wave packets in many different paths . by linearity",
    "the packets in each path evolve independently of the others .",
    "however , this can lead to great entanglement among the different degrees of freedom in the system being modelled .",
    "how much entanglement , if any , depends on the basis set used and the system being modelled . in quantum computation use of linear superpositions in this manner is referred to as computation by quantum parallelism @xcite .",
    "for example , a linear combination of the two packet states shown in figure 1 would evolve in parallel .",
    "a hamiltonian description of quantum ballistic evolution can be obtained by use of feynman s prescription @xcite .",
    "that is , given an arbitrary step operator @xmath0 for a process ( which may or may not be distinct path generating ) define the corresponding @xmath27 by @xmath28 this hamiltonian has the advantage that is it simple .",
    "that is , it has a complexity of the order of @xmath0 . in particular , it does not have the complexity of all paths generated by iteration of @xmath0 or its adjoint . in the case that @xmath0 models a quantum computation",
    ", @xmath27 has the complexity of the computer program .",
    "this is especially desirable in the case that @xmath0 models a universal turing machine .    in general for an arbitrary step operator",
    ", the hamiltonian given above does not describe quantum ballistic evolution .",
    "if @xmath0 is a step operator for a collection of paths that intersect or join , then @xmath29 will describe the unitary evolution of some process .",
    "but it may be a different process from that obtained by iteration of @xmath0 .",
    "this is especially the case if iteration of @xmath0 describes an irreversible process .",
    "for example , there are operators @xmath30 such that the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ ham ] describes the evolution of a different process , namely , that with the step operator @xmath31 .    if @xmath0 is distinct path generating , then the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ ham ] describes quantum ballistic evolution . to see this ,",
    "consider the power series expansion of @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "each term in the expansion has the form @xmath34 where the @xmath35 are nonnegative integers . because @xmath0 is distinct path generating",
    ", the term will describe motion back and forth along each path . for finite paths of length @xmath36 , terms for which @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , will give @xmath16 operating on any state in the path . if @xmath39 is a state not on any path of @xmath0 then @xmath40 which shows no change occurs .",
    "this is clearly a description of quantum ballistic evolution as motion is restricted to be in either direction along the distinct paths .",
    "no motion occurs on states outside the paths .",
    "conversely if @xmath27 is an arbitrary hamiltonian describing quantum ballistic evolution on some basis @xmath7 then a step operator @xmath0 which is distinct path generating can be associated with @xmath27 .",
    "details of the construction will be given later on .",
    "as noted earlier a step operator associated with a process is defined to be that operator @xmath0 such that iteration of @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) defines forward ( or backward ) motion of the process on each of the paths .",
    "note that there is an arbitrariness which is decided by convention : namely , that @xmath0 and not @xmath1 is associated with the forward direction for the process on each path . also @xmath0 is defined to be a step operator if there exists some basis @xmath7 ( the step basis ) such that for each state @xmath39 in @xmath7 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are orthogonal to @xmath39 .    for processes such as computations ,",
    "the step operator @xmath0 is a sum of time ordered products of noncommuting operators for which the time interval is @xmath16 but the noncommutativity and thus the time ordering remains .",
    "computer programs have this property in that they are sums of elementary program elements each of which is a product of time ordered spatially local actions .",
    "because there is no finite time interval associated with @xmath0 it can be used directly to construct hamiltonians such as the feynman hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ ham ] .",
    "another desirable feature is that for many models of processes , @xmath27 can be separated into kinetic and potential energy parts .",
    "this is the case for models of quantum turing machines which will be modelled as motion of a head on a one dimensional space lattice of qubits . for these models , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 denotes free motion along the lattice . in this case",
    "@xmath47 represents the ( symmetrized ) lattice equivalent of the second derivative @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the interaction potential between the head and lattice systems . in this form @xmath27",
    "is seen to be similar to that used in the tight binding model ( with off - diagonal potentials ) to describe one dimensional particle motion in solids @xcite .",
    "this similarity will be exploited in future work .    from the above it",
    "is clear that it is important to be able to determine if an operator @xmath0 is distinct path generating .",
    "this appears difficult since it appears necessary to examine the properties of all powers of @xmath0 and its adjoint , or instead examine the action of @xmath0 and its adjoint on all states in the basis .",
    "it is desirable to investigate other properties of operators which can be proved equivalent to distinct path generating and for which effective decision procedures may exist .",
    "the next section is concerned with two candidate properties , orthogonality preservation and stability .",
    "as was noted in the introduction the work of bennett and landauer @xcite showed that an irreversible computation could be made reversible by addition of history degrees of freedom .",
    "the expanded process was reversible in that distinct states remained distinct with no overlap as the process evolved . from a quantum mechanical viewpoint",
    "an important part of this work is the preservation of orthogonality relative to some basis .",
    "these considerations suggest the following definition : let @xmath50 denote a basis set for a finite or separable hilbert space @xmath51 and @xmath0 be a bounded linear operator over @xmath51 : +   + * definition 2 * _ an operator @xmath0 is _ weakly orthogonality preserving _ in the basis @xmath50 if for all @xmath52 . _ +   + note that the definition applies to all states including those for which either @xmath53 or @xmath54",

    "this would be applicable for instance to binary bits represented by the states @xmath67 .",
    "these simple examples show the basis dependence of weak orthogonality preservation in quantum mechanics .",
    "these two operators appear equivalent as far as the definition is concerned .",
    "yet one feels intuitively that there is a difference .",
    "the relevant difference is seen by considering the adjoints .",
    "the adjoint of the first example preserves orthogonality weakly in a different basis , namely .",
    "@xmath68 , whereas the adjoint of the projection operator preserves orthogonality weakly in the same basis .    from these and other examples , such as the turing machine examples studied in @xcite ,",

    "if physicists license of usage is allowed , the theorem guarantees the existence of an eigenfunction expansion which is common to both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "several aspects of the material presented so far in this paper should be stressed .",
    "first , it is important to emphasize the distinction between the reversibility and ballistic properties of a step operator @xmath0 and those of the associated feynman hamiltonian @xmath160 . in general @xmath0 , including those defined for qtms by eqs .",

    "this process is not reversible as iteration of @xmath0 describes paths which join .",
    "as landauer @xcite has emphasized , information is destroyed . in this case the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ ham ] will describe evolution of another process which is reversible and not that associated with iteration of @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of quantum turing machines used here ( section [ qctm ] ) differs from that proposed by deutsch @xcite and bernstein and vazirani @xcite and which is often quoted in the literature .",
    "these authors restrict @xmath0 to be unitary and local in the computation basis and to apply to a finite time .",
    "that is , @xmath2 for some finite time interval @xmath390 .",
    "as was noted earlier in this paper , it is impossible to satisfy these requirements with a hamiltonian which is local and is simple in that it has the complexity of @xmath0 and not of all powers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that one combine the two approaches by restricting @xmath0 to be unitary and to refer to infinitesimal time steps only . in this way",
    "the feynman hamiltonian @xcite , eq , [ ham ] , constructed from unitary @xmath0 is local and is simple .",
    "there are some problems with this approach .",

    "step operators constructed as sums of local step or program elements used in algorithms are not likely to be unitary . the definition given here",
    "in which @xmath0 is not even required to be normal is more general and it corresponds more closely to what one actually does in construction of algorithms as sums of local step or program elements . as an example consider simon s algorithm @xcite for a quantum computation .",
    "this consists of two `` fourier transforms '' separated by the computation of a function @xmath391 with @xmath392 to generate the state @xmath393 .",

    "the sum is over all @xmath191 @xmath286 strings @xmath394 of length @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that any step operator @xmath0 , which corresponds to a sum of local steps for computation of the function and generation of @xmath395 from @xmath396 is not likely to be unitary .",
    "another way around this problem might be to consider any step operator @xmath0 for a qtm as defined here such that @xmath0 is a partial isometry and is orthogonality preserving on some basis .",
    "then dilate @xmath0 to a unitary operator on the whole hilbert space by suitable extension of the definition of @xmath0 to the null subspace .",
    "one problem with this is that there is no way to effectively define either the null subspace or the subspace on which @xmath0 is unitary .",
    "this problem was already mentioned for earlier work @xcite . in particular",
    ", the null ( or unitary ) subspace consists of all states in some basis which are not ( or are ) reached at some stage of the computation on some input .",
    "if @xmath0 is the step operator for a ( deterministic ) universal turing machine , an effective definition of the null or unitary subspaces would require solution of the halting problem which is impossible .",
    "another problem with this approach is that even if the dilation is unitary , powers of the dilation would not correspond to powers of the original @xmath0 .",
    "this was examined elsewhere @xcite where minimal unitary power dilations @xmath397 of step operators were constructed .",
    "it was seen that the construction added an extra degree of freedom and that history was generated automatically when needed",
    ".    however examples of deterministic turing machine step operators showed that @xmath0 needed to be expanded by addition of history and copy degrees of freedom prior to unitary power dilation .",
    "this was needed to avoid most of the state amplitude going into history components .",
    "this suggests that , at least for deterministic qtms , unitary power dilation with the addition of another degree of freedom is not needed .",
    "it is not known if unitary power dilation of step operators for nondeterministic qtms has any advantages .",
    "another problem with expansion of a process step operator into a unitary operator by addition of degrees of freedom is that all degrees of freedom need to be kept isolated from the environment so that coherence between phases of the states of all degrees of freedom are maintained .",
    "this is especially important for constructing quantum mechanical computers as their operation ( for example , shor s algorithm @xcite ) depends on maintaining phase relations among the different components .",
    "this suggests that it is important to minimize the number of degrees of freedom to be added . in this way effects of the environment , such as decoherence , etc",
    "@xcite make it useful to minimize the number of additional degrees of freedom that need to be protected .",
    "the results of this paper suggest that to ensure quantum ballistic evolution , it is sufficient to add just enough additional degrees of freedom so that a step operator @xmath0 for the expanded process is a partial isometry , preserves orthogonality , and is stable for some basis . in particular",
    ", it is not necessary to add even more degrees of freedom to ensure that the expanded operator is unitary .",
