    "the equation of state ( eos ) relating the pressure , compression , and temperature of solids is important to understand the structure of rocky planets and the response of materials for dynamic loading during impacts or energetic events such as explosions .",
    "the eos also provides a test of our knowledge of underlying physics , particularly the states of electrons under the influence of the ions , described by many - body quantum mechanics .",
    "accurate and thermodynamically - complete eos are valuable as it is extremely difficult to measure the temperature of material in a shock wave experiment , and temperature is a key parameter determining the rate at which plastic flow , phase transitions , and chemical reactions occur .",
    "several approaches have been devised to calculate the eos essentially from first principles .",
    "one way of classifying the approaches is into those in which the electrons are treated explicitly , and those in which the effect of the electrons is subsumed into effective interatomic potentials .",
    "although interatomic potentials can be derived from calculations in which the electrons are included explicitly @xcite , it can be difficult to represent the non - local aspects of the electron wavefunctions faithfully via an interatomic potential , and additional complications arise in deriving cross - potentials between dissimilar types of atom , which are necessary for calculations of compounds and alloys . with the electrons treated explicitly ,",
    "some eos calculations have been made for elements of low atomic number in which exchange and correlation in the electron wavefunctions have been treated rigorously using quantum monte - carlo techniques @xcite , but these calculations are computationally intensive and have spanned relatively narrow ranges in state space . almost universally , exchange and correlation between the electron states have been treated using variants of the kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , which allows the electrons to be represented efficiently as single - particle states .",
    "similarly , excitations of the electrons and ions have been represented with varying rigor .",
    "the electronic heat capacity may be treated with simple approximations such as the sommerfeld model @xcite , by populating the density of electron energy levels calculated at zero temperature , with a density of levels which is calculated consistently with the excitations @xcite , or it may be ignored altogether in many situations sampling states from room temperature to an electron - volt or so .",
    "ionic motion has been incorporated through a grneisen model ( usually fitted to the zero - temperature energy - volume relation ) @xcite , by performing simulations of the classical motion of the atoms under the action of interatomic potentials or forces from the electron states @xcite , and by calculating the normal modes of the crystal lattice and populating them as phonons .",
    "we have previously predicted eos and phase diagrams for elements using electron ground states calculated using dft , electron excitations into the zero - temperature band structure , and phonon modes calculated from electronic restoring forces as atoms are displaced from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "an attraction of the method is that compounds and alloys can in principle be treated in exactly the same way as elements .",
    "we have subsequently demonstrated that the electron ground states can be found , and eos estimated using a grneisen treatment of the thermal excitations , for the stoichiometric alloy niti @xcite . a careful study of the _ ab initio _",
    "phonon modes has been made at zero pressure for the stoichiometric alloy nial @xcite .",
    "here , we report a more rigorous calculation of the eos for nial using _ ab initio _ phonons @xcite and electronic excitations , and comparing with static and shock compression data .",
    "we also investigate the use of an empirical relation for the zero - temperature isotherm of nial .",
    "shock wave data have been obtained mainly from the impact of flyers launched by the expansion of compressed gases . in our experiments ,",
    "the flyer was accelerated by the expansion of a confined plasma , heated by a laser pulse .",
    "the interpretation of shock experiments often depends on the properties of other materials in the assembly , such as transparent windows , and these may be affected by time - dependent phenomena such as plastic flow .",
    "we discuss the validity of our laser - flyer experiments for measuring the eos of nial .",
    "a thermodynamically complete eos can be expressed as any thermodynamic potential with respect to its two natural variables , such as specific internal energy @xmath2 in terms of specific volume @xmath3 and specific entropy @xmath4 .",
    "the atomic properties of matter lead naturally to expressions for contributions to the internal energy in terms of the volume ( or mass density @xmath5 ) and temperature @xmath6 . following our previous study of the eos of elements @xcite , @xmath2",
    "was notionally split into the cold compression curve @xmath7 , lattice - thermal contribution @xmath8 , and electron - thermal contribution @xmath9 : @xmath10 the relation @xmath11 was then used to construct the thermodynamically complete relation @xmath12 and hence other desired quantities such as pressure , by invoking the second law of thermodynamics as described later .",
    "the cold compression energy @xmath7 was calculated from the ground state of the electrons with respect to stationary atoms , the lattice - thermal energy @xmath8 from the phonon modes of the crystal lattice , and the electron - thermal energy from the zero - temperature electron band structure though in practice it was a small contribution to the eos in the solid regime .      over the density range of interest ,",
    "the core electrons are affected relatively little by each atom s environment , so pseudopotentials were used in preference to all - electron calculations .",
    "the electronic ground states were calculated quantum mechanically using the castep computer code .",
    "this code implements the plane wave pseudopotential method to solve the kohn - sham equations of dft @xcite with respect to the schrdinger hamiltonian , to calculate energies and hellmann - feynman forces and stresses .",
    "pseudopotentials were generated using the troullier - martins method @xcite with 1s2s2p ( al ) and 1s2s2p3s3p ( ni ) electron shells treated as core .",
    "consequently 13 valence electrons per unit cell are considered .",
    "nial was treated as non - magnetic .    for a cubic material",
    ", a sequence of constant volume calculations suffices to determine the cold compression curve .",
    "the volume was held fixed while restoring forces were calculated to determine the dynamical matrix @xcite .    at standard temperature and pressure ( stp ) ,",
    "nial adopts the cscl ( or b2 ) structure , with lattice parameter @xmath13  @xcite , giving a crystal density of 5.912g/@xmath14 .",
    "a plane wave cutoff of 900ev and a symmetry - reduced 10@xmath15 @xmath16-point grid @xcite was sufficient to converge the pulay - corrected ground states @xcite to @xmath010mev / @xmath15 or better .",
    "this level of convergence in pressure was 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the discrepancy from measured pressures introduced through the use of dft .",
    "isotropic compression calculations were performed to determine the cold compression curve @xmath17 .",
    "the lattice parameter was varied between 2.0 and 5.0at intervals of 0.1 , with additional calculations at intervals of 0.05  between 2.5 and 3.1  and 0.01  between 2.7 and 3.0 .",
    "( figs  [ fig : eccmp ] and [ fig : pclogcmp ] . )",
    "it is instructive to fit the electronic structure calculations to the rose functional form @xcite , which has been found empirically to describe the compression behavior of many elements .",
    "a functional fit such as the rose form is useful in that it provides a much more compact representation of the cold curve than does the tabulated relation obtained from a series of electronic structure calculations .",
    "it is interesting to assess the accuracy of this functional form in reproducing the expansion region as well as compressed states . for use with atomic structure calculations ,",
    "in which the binding energy contains a contribution from electrons to atoms as well as atoms to form the solid , the variation of binding energy with scaled compression can be described by @xmath18 which is a slight generalization of the original form of the relation @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is a scale length defined with respect to the wigner - seitz radius @xmath20 as a function of specific volume , @xmath21 the pressure along the cold compression curve is then @xmath22 the zero - pressure bulk modulus is related to the binding energy scale by @xmath23 the cold curve for a material is then described by three principal parameters ",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , and @xmath27  and an energy offset @xmath28 .",
    "the rose function has a theoretical connection with simple metals , in which the compression properties are dominated by the electron density . here , it was regarded as a convenient functional form for interpolating and smoothing data .",
    "non - linear optimization was used to obtain parameters from the quantum - mechanical predictions of the frozen - ion cold curve in pressure - volume or energy - volume space .",
    "some optimization schemes were unstable when the equilibrium volume @xmath29 was included as a free parameter . in practice ,",
    "@xmath29 was first estimated by inspection , and the remaining parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) were calculated for fixed @xmath29 .",
    "this process was repeated for a few different values of @xmath29 to investigate the sensitivity , and then a robust but inefficient monte - carlo optimization scheme was used to locate the optimum value of @xmath29 .",
    "the rose function was not able to reproduce the shape of the quantum mechanical cold compression curve over its whole range .",
    "separate fits were produced using the whole set of quantum mechanical states , and using only the states under compression , which is the more relevant part of the curve for the shock wave studies of interest .",
    "the fit to the compression portion was good : generally within the numerical scatter of the quantum mechanical states .",
    "it is possible that the rose function performs worse in expansion because it does not represent adequately the localization of electrons on individual atoms as the rarefied metal ceases to conduct .",
    "the predicted parameters for nial were bracketed by the ( observed ) parameters for ni and al , but not so as to suggest any systematic trend ( e.g. averaging ) that could be used to predict alloy properties ; this highlights the inaccuracy of using mixture models as is commonly attempted to predict the properties of alloys , particularly intermetallic compounds @xcite .",
    "( table  [ tab : rose ] and figs  [ fig : eccmp ] to [ fig : pclogcmp ] . )    [ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > \" , ]     the hydrodynamic model for nial was used with the hydrodynamic model for lif .",
    "the elastic and elastic - plastic models for nial were used with the elastic - plastic model for lif .",
    "the precursor waves and the deceleration following the peak of the shock can be used to infer flow stresses and spall strengths . however , simple models parameterized from these data can be misleading , so the detailed constitutive behavior of nial will be reported separately in the context of microstructural response . the true ( i.e. normal ) stress to induce plastic flow at lower strain rates has been reported at around 1.5gpa @xcite , corresponding to a flow stress of around 0.4gpa .",
    "one would expect the stresses to be at least as large on the shorter time scales of the laser experiments , so the flow stress inferred from the window impact experiments is quite plausible .",
    "the frozen - ion compression curve for nial in the cscl structure was predicted using _",
    "ab initio _ quantum mechanical calculations of the electron band structure .",
    "the calculations reproduced the lattice parameter at @xmath30 to @xmath01%  with no corrections , equivalent to a discrepancy @xmath31gpa . the _ ab initio _ pressure - volume relation calculated using the hellmann - feynman theorem was not perfectly consistent with the _ ab initio _ energy - volume relation ; this reflects the lower precision of the stress calculations . the rose functional form , found to fit the energy - volume relation for compression of a wide range of elements ,",
    "was found to fit the energy - volume relation for compression of nial , but deviated significantly in expansion .",
    "the electron band structure was used to predict electron - thermal excitations . the mechanical response in the equation of state and shock hugoniot did not alter much when the electron - thermal contribution was included , though the hugoniot pressure - temperature relation varied by around 1%  per thousand kelvin .",
    "the charge distribution in the electron ground states was used to predict _ ab initio _",
    "phonon modes , from the forces on the atoms when one was displaced from equilibrium .",
    "the phonon density of states was quite sensitive to the magnitude of the displacement  though the restoring force on the displaced atom itself suggested that the effective potential it experienced was essentially harmonic  but thermodynamically - complete equations of state constructed using the phonon modes were not sensitive to the details of the density of phonon states up to @xmath0100gpa .",
    "the quasiharmonic equations of state reproduced published measurements of isothermal compression of nial extremely well , and were also consistent with measurements of the shock compression .",
    "laser - driven flyer experiments were performed to measure states on the principal shock hugoniot of nial , by impacting cu flyers into nial targets and by impacting nial flyers against lif windows .",
    "shock transit times were not measured accurately enough to constrain the eos .",
    "shock states from the cu flyer data were obtained with respect to the hugoniot of cu or pmma .",
    "these states were consistent with the _ ab initio _",
    "eos for nial .",
    "detailed interpretation of the nial flyer data depends on the elastic - plastic behavior of the nial and the lif . ignoring these elastic contributions ,",
    "the shock states were consistent with theoretical eos .",
    "if the lif was assumed to response elastically , the stress states deduced were implausibly high .",
    "if it was assumed to response with the same flow stress as observed in gas gun experiments  which typically explore somewhat longer time scales  then it was possible to reproduce the shock states by taking either eos and adjusting the flow stress in the nial .",
    "reasonable agreement was obtained for the quasiharmonic eos with a flow stress of 0.53gpa , which is consistent with the range of values deduced from the amplitude of the elastic precursor wave in other shock loading experiments .",
    "the quasiharmonic eos  which was found to reproduce quasistatic compression data extremely well  is thus consistent with the shock measurements .",
