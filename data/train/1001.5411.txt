    "statistical mechanics has proven to be one of the most powerful tools for understanding transitions between states in physical systems .",
    "this predictive power has been successfully extended to gently perturbed systems through linear response theory.@xcite such an approach emphasizes the significance of _ intensive _ state variables , analogous to temperature or pressure in equilibrium systems , but potentially extends their relevance to the wider spectrum of out - of - equilibrium systems .",
    "however , this formalism is not valid for systems driven far from equilibrium , even when in well defined steady states . it remains an open question whether or not state variables can be defined in a generic way for non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "the hope is that such state variables would carry predictive power regarding the system s response to a change in the driving parameters , or its behavior when put in contact with another system .",
    "a key situation in which such tools are expected to be relevant is that of granular materials : systems composed of individual particles large enough to be insensitive to thermal fluctuations .",
    "such materials are ubiquitous in natural and industrial contexts , and models of their dynamics would benefit from an improved understanding of how to prepare and manipulate them in well - defined macrostates determined by a small set of control parameters analogous to thermal intensivities .",
    "promising measures of the temperature - like edwards compactivity @xcite have been made in static granular systems @xcite , as well as kubo - type fluctuation / response pairs @xcite leading to effective temperature measurements in dynamic granular systems @xcite .",
    "however , it remains an open question to what extent these temperature - like variables behave as true temperatures .    for granular materials under strong agitation ,",
    "the interactions of individual particles are dominated by binary collisions .",
    "such dynamics are well - described by a thermal - like kinetic theory in which the velocity fluctuations play the role of temperature @xcite . however , the denser states relevant to many important granular flows are dominated by multi - body interactions and such states remain difficult to model through kinetic theory approaches @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these dense states is strikingly reminiscent of supercooled liquids @xcite , where classical statistical mechanics also loses validity due to a loss of ergodicity .",
    "both the thermodynamic glass transition and the jamming transition in dense granular materials lack a fundamental understanding , and both have been hampered by the difficulty of making a relevant quantitative description of the state of the system .",
    "this universal phenomenology , embodied by a dramatic slowing down of the dynamics @xcite , caging @xcite , and memory effects @xcite , is now referred to as the _ jamming _ transition , and is at the heart of a very active field of research which is the subject of this special issue .",
    "thermodynamics is founded on , among other things , a meaningful equilibration of intensive state variables between subsystems .",
    "thus , if a thermodynamic - like description of granular materials is to be found , an informative first step would be to search for an analog of the zeroth law of thermodynamics . by putting two athermal systems in contact and allowing them to reach a steady state",
    ", one can seek relevant intensive parameters by discarding properties that fail to equilibrate .",
    "we experimentally conduct such an investigation , putting two model granular subsystems in contact .    in our experiments ,",
    "we allow two adjacent monolayers of particles , differing in material properties , to exchange volume with each other under external agitation and an overall constant - volume constraint .",
    "we study the steady - state properties of the two subsystems as a function of the overall average packing fraction in the vicinity of their jamming transition .",
    "importantly , we uncover a materials - independent relationship between the average packing fraction and its fluctuations .",
    "this relationship defines an intensive parameter that decouples from the volume statistics of the subsystems , and remarkably takes the same value in both subsystems .",
    "this observation provides a strong constraint on the eventual establishment of a granular equation of state . moreover , among various dynamical quantities studied , an effective diffusion coefficient is shown to take the same value in the `` equilibrated '' subsystems , while the structural relaxation times exhibit different behaviors .",
    "while a thermodynamic system would lead to temperature equilibration , the present situation leads to a decoupling of the mobility and the structural relaxation time , and only the former seems to yield relevant information about the properties shared by subsystems in steady states .",

    "we study the equilibration of two adjacent dense bidisperse layers of disks on an air table , as sketched in fig .",

    "a piston separates the two subsystems , and is constrained to move along the long axis of the air table by protruding feet which impede rotation . on each side of the table , the system is prepared with an identical number of particles @xmath3 , with the ratio of small to large particles fixed at @xmath4 .",
    "this ratio suppresses crystallization and provides roughly the same volume of large ( diameter @xmath5 mm ) and small particles ( @xmath6 mm ) .",
    "the particles within each subsystem have a different set of material properties : on side 1 , the particles have restitution coefficient @xmath7 and friction coefficient @xmath8 ; on side 2 , the particles have @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "restitution coefficients were measured from isolated binary collisions ; friction coefficients are nominal values from the literature .",
    "both sides utilize standard plastic petri dishes as the particles , with the difference in particle properties achieved by encircling the particles on side 1 with a rubber band . because the sides of the particles slope inwards , the thickness of the rubber band does not significantly change the radius of the particles ;",

    "these bumpers are triggered pairwise : bumpers facing each other in the system fire at the same time in order to prevent net momentum and torque injection .",
    "these pairs are triggered randomly via a pre - generated random sequence .",
    "four pairs of bumpers are randomly fired every @xmath11 second , and travel 1 cm into the granular pack ; the total time during which the bumpers stay in their forward position is approximately 0.1 sec .    to quantify the long - time mobility of the particles , we take images at a frequency which is low compared to the energy injection timescale , making usual tracking techniques inoperative . therefore , we have developed a tracking method which identifies each particle by a unique tag .",
    "each particle is marked with a @xmath12 array of colored dots which encodes two copies of a 4-bit , 4-digit identifier , plus an error - correcting bit .",
    "the particles are located by their circular rims and their identities are established using the tags , allowing their positions adjacent image frames to be connected into trajectories .",
    "we monitor the positions of the piston and the inner 75% of the particles with a ccd camera mounted above the apparatus ; we obtain a minimum of @xmath13 configurations for each experiment .    to understand the equilibration of the system on its approach to jamming , we perform experiments at increasing values of @xmath3 while holding all other variables constant . we adjust @xmath3 in increments of 2 small and 1 large particle on each side , so that the two sides always have the same @xmath3 .",
    "the average packing fraction @xmath14 calculated for the entire system is given by @xmath15 as well as by the ratio of the total area of @xmath3 disks to the total area of the air table .",

    "first we focus on the macroscopic state of the system , namely the volume occupied by each of the subsystems .",
    "since the overall volume of the system is conserved , we only need to consider the position of the piston scaled by the length of the cell @xmath26 , where the origin of the axis is taken on the side occupied by the particles that have been circled by a rubber band , referred to as side 1 in the following discussion .",
    "we first consider the time signal @xmath27 for a given value of @xmath3 , an example of which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdan]a . after a transient time @xmath28 ,",
    "the signal becomes stationary and the system has reached steady state .",
    "this state is observed for all reported values of @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath28 is comparable to the @xmath29-relaxation time @xmath30 of the assembly , i.e. the time it takes for the particles to diffuse further that their size @xcite .",
    "we hence consider the probability distribution of @xmath0 in this stationary regime and we find gaussian statistics even for the largest @xmath3 ( densest @xmath14 ) ; sample distributions are shown in fig .",

    "these statistics are thus characterized by the first two moments .",
    "we observe that the average piston position @xmath32 is observed to be @xmath33 for all values of @xmath3 : side 1 , containing the particles with rubber bands , occupies less volume than the side without .",
    "we conclude that this systematic deviation from equal volumes originates from the difference in material properties of the particles . furthermore , and rather surprisingly",
    ", @xmath34 is not a monotonic function of @xmath3 : it increases until it reaches @xmath35 for @xmath36 and then decreases for larger values of @xmath3 . at this crossover",

    "the behavior of the system is qualitatively different on each side of this transition point . for values of @xmath38 , the particles interact mostly through short binary collisions and the system looks liquid - like . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by multi - body interactions and becomes much slower . in watching the system , intermittent force chains @xcite are be observed to carry the motion imposed by the boundaries into the bulk of the system , and some particles stay in contact with one another on time scales larger than the typical collision time .",
    "however , no permanent stress seems to be trapped in the system until it jams : this occurs at the highest explored value of @xmath3 as will be quantified below .",
    "interestingly , this transition at @xmath37 is close to , but perhaps slightly below , independent measurements of random loose packing for these particles : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . to determine @xmath42 for each of the two types of particles , we placed the table at a @xmath43 angle , and rained down single particles from the high end to the low end to create the loosest packing accessible to us .",
    "these values are upper bounds for random loose packing , for our protocol does not guarantee that we reach the loosest possible stable packs .",
    "the standard deviation of these distributions , @xmath44 , exhibits a simpler behavior : it is a decreasing function of @xmath3 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdamoments]b .",
    "this is to be expected from the fact that as @xmath3 increases a smaller amount of free volume is available for the motion of the piston .",
    "notably , this quantity does not exhibit any special feature in the vicinity of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , the magnitude of @xmath31 at the highest explored value of @xmath3 closely matches the volume fluctuations imposed by the bumpers .",
    "this mean that this macroscopic quantity becomes trivial when the system approaches its jammed state , merely reproducing the microscopic fluctuations imposed by the injection mechanism .",
    "however , even in the densest state explored the system is not strictly rigid : particles continue to rearrange due to the impacts from the boundaries .",
    "we now turn to the microscopic information provided by particle - tracking . in order to extract a well - defined , size - independent microscopic quantity from the packing fraction field",
    ", we analyze the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the average local packing fraction @xmath46 over windows of increasing size , where @xmath46 is defined as the ratio of the number of pixels occupied by the particles to the total number of pixels in a given region . for each subsystem , we measure @xmath46 over boxes of size @xmath47 ranging from a few @xmath48 up to half the system size . for @xmath49 , @xmath50 converges to a constant .",

    "moreover , the fluctuations on each side are found to be decreasing functions of @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : equi]b . as for the fluctuations of @xmath0 ,",
    "this can be understood by the fact that as @xmath3 increases , the amount of free volume to be distributed among the particles decreases .",
    "finally , the discrepancy in the packing fraction statistics between the two sides gets larger on approach to jamming at large @xmath14 ( large @xmath3 ) , especially as the number of particles is increased above @xmath45 .    to examine the relevance of these two state variables , we plot the dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath59 , parametrized by @xmath3 ( see fig .

    "these changes in the dynamics suggest that the transition corresponds to two qualitatively different dynamical regimes . for @xmath103",
    ", the particles primarily interact through short binary collisions and there is weak coupling between the particles . because the system is collision - dominated , it is likely that the restitution coefficients of the particles are an important consideration in the dynamics .",

    "long multibody interactions dominate the dynamics , and we visually observe signs of intermittent force chains @xcite which strongly couple both particle - particle and particle - bumper interactions .",
    "it is likely that the higher friction coefficient on side 1 significantly increases the structural relaxation time of the corresponding assembly , and the dynamics are more sensitive to the frictional properties of the particles .",
    "interestingly , all measured quantities are approximately equal in each subsystem at @xmath45 .",
    "as the system approaches @xmath105 , the persistence time of the contact network increases , and the internal response of the particles is more correlated . for the largest studied value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the packing fraction and overall volume fluctuations are are imposed by the boundaries .",
    "hardly any rearrangement occurs on experimentally - accessible time scales , but extended internal vibrations can be observed : the behavior of the system is thus comparable to that of a solid .    from a thermodynamic point of view , it is remarkable that the effective diffusion coefficients defined above are the only measured quantities to take the same value in the equilibrated subsystems , whereas the relaxation times @xmath30 become very different from each other beyond @xmath45 . as a matter of fact , in equilibrium systems , the stokes - einstein relation states that the product of the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity ( or , equivalently , the relaxation time ) , is proportional to temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , only the product @xmath106 , and not @xmath86 itself , is expected to equilibrate . here",
    ", we find that there is a decoupling between the relaxation time and the diffusion coefficient beyond @xmath45 , which is reminiscent of the decoupling reported in the vicinity of the glass transition in supercooled liquids @xcite , the latter equilibrating while the former emphasizes the difference in material properties between the two sides .",
    "this phenomenon is yet another common feature between dense granular materials and supercooled liquids , and seems to indicate that fluctuation / response based temperatures might be relevant below @xmath42.@xcite    thus , we observe that both packing fraction ( or free volume ) and material properties play a key role in determining the state of the system . in static granular systems ,",
    "the edwards ensemble @xcite provides a framework for understanding how volume plays a central role in describing the density of states and associated boltzmann - like thermodynamic properties .",
    "while our system is dynamic , it is interesting to ask to what extent the equilibration of volume between two subsystems exhibits features reminiscent of the edwards formalism .",
    "the overall volume of our system is a conserved quantity , the dynamics explore a set of configurations ( although not strictly mechanically - stable ) , and we achieve stationary distributions of system properties such as @xmath59 . were volume the dominant state variable setting the density of states for this system , we would have observed @xmath107 , independent of @xmath3 . instead , the material properties of the particles play an important role in dynamically determining the state of the system , and we observe that in general @xmath108 .    in this paper , we have experimentally studied the steady state statistics of two model granular subsystems differing in their material properties put in contact through a mobile wall .",
    "we have uncovered several features that constrain any specification of a granular equation of state .",
    "first , most static and dynamical quantities are affected by a dynamical crossover which occurs at a packing fraction close to the ( static ) random loose packing .",
    "we interpret this crossover as separating the weak and strong coupling regimes in the behavior of the system .",
    "however , both the macroscopic volume fluctuations and the diffusion coefficients are insensitive to this transition .",
    "second , we have found that the packing fraction fluctuations are in a one - to - one correspondence with the average packing fraction , independent of the material properties of the grains .",
    "these fluctuations drop to zero on the approach to jamming .",
    "finally , the diffusion properties of the particles reveal a glassy feature known as decoupling which arises above random loose packing .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the structural relaxation timescale becomes both large and material - dependent for dense systems , the effective diffusion coefficient nonetheless takes the same value in each subsystem .",
    "this suggests that this coefficient is an important intensive parameter describing the state of the system .",
    "a theoretical understanding of these last two findings could come from the shrinking density of states on the approach to jamming .",
    "it is intriguing that the packing fraction fluctuations ( geometry ) suggest material - independence while the relaxation timescales ( dynamics ) suggest material - dependence .",

    "<S> we experimentally investigate the steady states of two granular assemblies differing in their material properties and allowed to exchange volume with each other under external agitation in the vicinity of their jamming transition . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the statistics of various static and dynamic quantities , and uncover a materials - independent relationship between the average packing fraction and its fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship defines an intensive parameter which decouples from the volume statistics , and remarkably takes the same value in both subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that an effective diffusion coefficient also takes the same value in each subsystem , even as the structural relaxation time increases over several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide strong constraints on the eventual establishment of a granular equation of state . </S>"
