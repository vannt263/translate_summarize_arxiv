    "the three dimensional distribution of velocities within a galactic disc contains a wealth of information about disc structure .",
    "one aspect that is immediately tractable with this information is the dynamical history of a disc .",
    "it has long been known that the random velocity of disc stars increases over their lifetime , a process dubbed disc heating .",
    "the two main contributors to this heating process  _ i.e. _ the increase of velocity dispersions over time  are molecular clouds , which scatter and heat stars more or less isotropically , and spiral irregularities , which primarily heat stars in the plane of the disc .",
    "jenkins & binney ( 1990 , see also jenkins 1992 ) have numerically studied the combined effect of these two processes . by varying the relative importance of the two mechanisms they showed that the ratio @xmath0 decreases when the contribution of spiral arm structure increases .",
    "although they made their predictions to explain the solar neighbourhood data , their results can also be applied to other galaxies provided @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be measured .    only in the immediate solar neighbourhood",
    "can the full distribution of stellar positions and velocities be obtained directly .",
    "the stellar velocities can be fitted by a trivariate gaussian @xmath3 , \\ ] ] a function originally proposed by schwarzschild ( 1907 ) .",
    "such a distribution is known as a velocity ellipsoid since the density of stars is constant on ellipsoids with semi - axes lengths given by the velocity dispersion components .",
    "solar neighbourhood observations show that @xmath4 which is consistent with the predictions of the gradual - heating mechanisms described above .",
    "other , more erratic heating occurs for instance during a minor merger event such as the accretion of a small satellite ( sellwood , nelson & tremaine , 1998 ) .",
    "depending on the geometry , this irregular heating process can lead to a substantial thickening of the disc and to a velocity ellipsoid that is significantly different than in the solar neighbourhood .    in a previous paper ( gerssen , kuijken & merrifield 1997 , hereafter paper  1 )",
    "we have shown that much can be inferred about the shapes of the velocity ellipsoids in external galaxies from spectra obtained along different position angles .",
    "most studies of stellar velocity dispersions have however concentrated on systems that are either close to edge - on or face - on and therefore only provide information about a single component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "but in an intermediate - inclination galaxy spectra obtained along radius vectors with different position angles will show different projections of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "in paper  1 we showed that we can derive the ratio of the vertical to radial velocity dispersion in ngc  488 from longslit spectra obtained along the major axis , where the line - of - sight velocities are a combination of the azimuthal and the vertical components , and along the minor axis , which gives a combination of the radial and vertical components .",
    "along an arbitrarily positioned spectrum the velocity dispersion in a thin axisymmetric disc can be written as    @xmath5 \\sin^2 i + \\sigma_z^2 \\cos^2 i .\\ ] ]    there are in fact only two independent quantities that can be extracted from the variation of @xmath6 with position angle ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "additional spectra , obtained along a third position angle , will therefore only supply redundant information  if the disc is perfectly axisymmetric .",
    "a further constraint is necessary if we want to retrieve all three components of the velocity dispersion .",
    "most of the disc stars orbits are nearly circular and can be adequately described using the epicycle approximation .",
    "this description leads to a relation between the radial and azimuthal components of the velocity dispersion ( _ e.g. _ binney & tremaine 1987 ) which yields the third constraint , provided that the observed velocity profiles are not significantly skewed : @xmath7 as shown by kuijken & tremaine ( 1991 ) , for higher accuracy @xmath8 here should be taken as the stellar rotation speed within the epicycle approximation . within this approximation , then , to leading order the shape of the velocity ellipsoid in the plane of the disc is a property of the galactic potential , independent of any disc heating mechanism .",
    "thus , this relation together with longslit spectra obtained along at least two different position angles ( preferably the major and minor axes for maximum leverage ) is sufficient to retrieve all three components of the stellar velocity ellipsoid .",
    "cross terms  _",
    "i.e. _ tilting of the velocity ellipsoid  will on average be zero along each line of sight through a galactic disc .",
    "the fact that disc stars possess random motions implies that discs are not completely rotationally supported  a situation that would be violently unstable anyway  and the stellar rotation speed will therefore be lower than the circular velocity .",
    "the difference between the two is called the asymmetric drift .",
    "an expression for the asymmetric drift can be derived by evaluating the velocity moments of the distribution function @xmath9 , see also paper  1 .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no coupling between the radial and the vertical components of the velocity dispersion .",
    "then @xmath11 , \\ ] ] where the disc photometrical scale length @xmath12 and the radius @xmath13 are in arcsec . by assuming a model distribution for the circular velocity the observed stellar rotation curve @xmath14 can be fitted directly using this equation .",
    "the circular velocity , @xmath8 , is modelled as a power law , @xmath15 .",
    "if the galaxy contains a cold gas disc , @xmath8 can be either included in the fitting procedure or serve as a consistency check on the results .",
    "the other two observables , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are modelled assuming exponential distributions for both the radial and the vertical velocity dispersion components .",
    "@xmath19 note that there is no a priori reason to believe that the scale length @xmath20 is the same for both the vertical and the radial component .",
    "given the present data , it is not possible to constrain both scale lengths independently .",
    "there are a total of five free parameters to be determined in our model .",
    "three parameters determine the velocity ellipsoid : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 ; and two describe the potential : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "=    we have applied the analysis described above to the sab galaxy ngc  2985 .",
    "it is a typical multi - armed spiral with an inclination of 36@xmath25 ( grosbol , 1985 ) .",
    "its distance , using an hubble constant of 75 , is 18  mpc and the amplitude of the inclination corrected hi rotation curve is about 250  km / s ( whisp database ) , see table  [ galpar ] .",
    ".parameters of ngc  2985 [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ fitpar ]    =    the projected model distributions of section 2 were fitted simultaneously to the observables . however , unlike in paper 1 we were unable to apply the non - linear fitting ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) routines successfully , probably because the present data set is noisier and contains fewer data points .",
    "fitting is therefore accomplished using a combination of a simulated annealing ( a.k.a .",
    "biased random walk , rix & white 1992 ) method and the downhill simplex method ( press et al .",
    "since the number of data points is rather small we have included the emission line data directly into the fitting procedure .",
    "this allowed us to better constrain the model distributions although it also meant that we had to sacrifice the consistency check on the result .",
    "error estimates were obtained numerically since the minimisation of a function does not provide direct estimates of the uncertainties involved .",
    "one - sigma errors have been estimated from a brute force calculation . in this procedure",
    "we calculated @xmath26 values by varying all five fitting parameters in a broad range around their best - fit values ( _ i.e. _ @xmath26 is sampled on a five - dimensional grid ) .",
    "one - sigma errors correspond to an increase of unity in @xmath26 over its best - fit value . the projection of the grid inclosure where @xmath27 onto the principal axes determines the one - sigma uncertainty in each individual parameter . a two dimensional projection of this grid",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigrsigz ] . here",
    "the grid is projected onto the plane spanned by the radial and vertical velocity dispersion axes .",
    "the distribution of points , ` the error cloud ' , not only yields the one - sigma errors but it also provides a measure of the covariance between the two parameters .",
    "the confidence intervals have also been estimated from a monte - carlo study of a large number of new data sets , with each new data set drawn randomly from the original data set .",
    "this bootstrapping procedure resulted in slightly larger error - bars but did not change the numerical values of the parameters suggesting that the brute force calculation is probably a bit to restrictive in its estimate of the uncertainties .",
    "for the two parameters that we are most interested in , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the difference appears to be at a minimum anyway .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ fitpar ] and the corresponding model distributions are together with the data presented in fig.[bestfit ] .",
    "the associated @xmath26 value of 50 , however , is a bit higher than what is formally required by chi - square fitting .",
    "but the scatter of the data points around the best - fit models , especially along the major axis velocity dispersion is rather large and the large value of @xmath26 can probably be attributed to that .",
    "it even appears that the best - fit profile along the major axis actually lies too low given the data points . along this axis",
    "the observed dispersions are a combination of the tangential and the vertical velocity dispersion components while the minor axis measures the radial and vertical components . implying that the dispersions along the minor axis should be higher than along the major axis if the components are distributed in the canonical way , @xmath4 .    however , the difference between the circular velocity and the stellar rotation speed ( top panel of fig .",
    "2 ) is roughly proportional to the radial velocity dispersion , see equation  [ adrift ] .",
    "a higher best - fit major axis profile therefore also implies a smaller difference between the circular velocity and the rotational velocity , which is certainly not warranted by this data set .",
    "the best - fit kinematical scale length parameter , @xmath20 , is about twice as large as the photometrical scale length . a result predicted by the local isothermal approximation of stellar discs ( _ e.g. _ van der kruit & freeman , 1986 ) .",
    "the results derived in the previous section imply a ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of @xmath28 = 0.85 @xmath29 0.1 .",
    "the one - sigma error includes the covariance ",
    "evident from the fact that the distribution of points in fig .",
    "[ sigrsigz ] is not completely circular  between the two parameters . with the error",
    "estimates obtained from bootstrapping the ratio becomes 0.85 @xmath29 0.13 .",
    "all the one - sigma points in fig .",
    "[ sigrsigz ] are located below the line @xmath30 . indeed , according to the generic picture of the gradual heating of stellar discs ( jenkins & binney , 1990 ) the ratio @xmath28  starting from an isotropic distribution of velocity dispersions  will become smaller than one given enough time .",
    "if only giant molecular clouds are responsible for heating this ratio will approach 0.75 and , if spiral structure also contributes to the disc heating the ratio will be lower .",
    "the derived ratio is therefore just consistent with the picture where disc heating is dominated by giant molecular clouds .",
    "=    the obtained velocity ellipsoid axis ratio is a little higher but comparable to the value found for ngc  488 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the slightly rounder velocity ellipsoid found in ngc  2985 may reflect a genuine difference in the internal heating mechanisms .",
    "since both galaxies are multi - armed type spiral galaxies but the sab galaxy ngc  2985 is of slightly earlier type than ngc  488 , which is an sb galaxy .",
    "however , in both galaxies the axis ratios ( average values around one disc scale length ) are somewhat higher than in the solar neighbourhood ( at about two disc scale lengths ) where the most accurate measurements using the _ hipparcos _ data indicate a ratio of 0.53 @xmath29 0.07 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "this behaviour is again consistent with the predictions of simple disc heating mechanisms since our own galaxy is of type sbc and therefore has a higher contribution from heating by spiral structure resulting in a flatter velocity ellipsoid .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "the observed trend may be slightly fortuitous given the large error - bars on each point .",
    "however , photometric observations of edge - on galaxies ( van der kruit and de grijs , 1999 and references therein ) indicate a similar trend , _",
    "i.e. _ late type spiral galaxies are more flattened than early type spiral galaxies .",
    "a larger sample is clearly needed to clarify the significance of this trend .",
    "the relevant measurements for a single galaxy typically require one night on a 4 m class telescope . doubling or tripling the sample size",
    "can thus be done in a relative short time span and should unequivocally establish the validity of the current disc heating theories .",
    "the wht is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
