    "a recent paper by @xcite ( paper  i , hereafter ) described the results of a modeling survey of beat cepheids that pulsate in the fundamental ( f ) mode and the first overtone ( o1 ) simultaneously . in order to allow a convenient comparison with the observations , paper  i presented the results in a @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 diagram , a so called petersen diagram , as a function of metallicity @xmath0 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fundamental and first overtone periods , respectively , and @xmath4 .",
    "the two periods can easily be extracted from the observed light curves . from the metallicity",
    "dependent petersen diagram one can set bounds on the metallicity @xmath0 of the star .",
    "this way of determining the metallicity is independent of and complementary to all other stellar and galactic metallicity probes .",
    "@xcite found that the petersen diagrams are rather insensitive to stellar rotation rates and to the galactic helium enrichment function @xmath5 that they used .",
    "however , the results exhibited sensitivity to the chemical mixture that is lumped into the metallicity parameter @xmath0 , mainly through their effect on the opacities .",
    "the survey of paper i used the opal gn93 opacities ( @xcite for the solar mixture of @xcite , merged with the @xcite opacities at the lower temperatures ( log @xmath63.95 ) .    in the last couple of years",
    "@xcite have dramatically revised the solar chemical composition of metals .",
    "the most important change is a decrease of elements with atomic numbers @xmath7 , but dominated by o , in favor of elements with @xmath8 of which fe has the most important effect on the opacities . in view of the sensitivity of the petersen diagrams to the chemical mixture",
    "we have thought it useful to update our survey with opal opacities that reflect these new abundances .    in this study , as in paper i , we use a solar elemental mixture even in low metallicity cepheids out of expediency , because there is no observationally derived information available that would let one improve much upon such an approximation at this time .    in a linear study such as this",
    "the beat cepheids are defined as being simultaneously unstable in the fundamental ( f ) and the first overtone ( o1 ) modes .",
    "however , it is well known from nonlinear cepheid studies ( @xcite ) that not all stars in this linear beat cepheid instability strip will actually undergo stable beat pulsations ( a large fraction will be either f _ or _",
    "o1 cepheids ) .",
    "this computationally convenient , linear definition therefore considerably overestimates the beat cepheid instability strip ( broader by at least a factor of 3  4 in  in a theoretical hr diagram @xcite .",
    "this in turn increases considerably the separation of the upper and lower boundaries in the petersen diagrams with a concomitant increase in the uncertainty of the stellar metallicities .",
    "the linear properties of stars do not allow one to infer the modal selection which is intrinsically nonlinear @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a tighter , and correct , definition and study of beat cepheids it is necessary to resort to a full amplitude hydrodynamic survey of models which requires a huge computing effort .",
    "such a survey will be presented in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .    in",
    " 2 we display the computed petersen diagrams for the ags solar elemental composition . in ",
    "3 we discuss the adequacy of envelope models for cepheids , and find that it is necessary to compute full stellar models for the short period , low metallicity cepheids .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "this survey proceeds in parallel with the one presented by @xcite for the gn93 solar chemical mixture , and we do not repeat a description of the procedure and of the modeling details here .",
    "we just mention that we have kept the same helium enrichment function @xmath9 ( fig  [ figyz ] ) that was based on an interpolation between the standard values for the galaxy and the two magellanic clouds .",
    "we stress again that the results are very broadly insensitive to this relation .",
    "we have used the opal website to generate opacities as a function of metallicity @xmath0 with the mixture of elements that are taken from the ags table of solar abundances .",
    "our newly computed petersen diagrams for the ags mixture are displayed in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ figags ] .",
    "the left - side and right - side panels show the lower and upper bounds , respectively , of the allowed beat cepheid regions as a function of metallicity @xmath0 .",
    "we alternate the line - type ( or color ) for the successive @xmath0 values to make the diagrams easier to use . in order to avoid crowding",
    "we have omitted the labels 0.001 to 0.005 on the upper curves in the left - side panels .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the lowest and largest @xmath0 values that are obtained for all beat cepheids in the respective galaxy .",

    "the gn93 models have been recomputed with the same zoning ( 200 mass - shells ) as for the new ags results , which is a little finer than that used in @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ags mixture causes an overall downward shift of the curves , especially for the shorter periods . and a downward stretching for the longer periods .",
    "one therefore obtains generally lower metallicities with the ags solar mixture than with the gn93 solar mixture .",
    "this is of course expected since ags have revised the metallicity for the sun down to @xmath15 .    the locations of the known beat cepheids are superposed in fig .",

    "[ figags ] are used as follows :",
    "if a beat cepheid falls between the upper and lower boundaries for a given @xmath0 value , that means that models with that value of @xmath0 are compatible with the observed period constraints for the given beat cepheid . by finding all the compatible @xmath0 values one can set upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 . in practice",
    ", one interpolates between the displayed curves in order to refine the @xmath0 bounds .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present the metallicities for the 4 galaxies in which a significant number of beat cepheids are known . from the composite petersen diagram",
    "we infer for each star ( i ) the range of possible @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 which , as we have seen , represent the uncertainty range of @xmath0 for each beat cepheid ( due to the width of the instability strip ) .",
    "we define @xmath13 as the minimum over the galactic sample of these @xmath21 and @xmath14 as the maximum of the @xmath20 .",
    "finally we introduce the galactic average @xmath12 as the average of the centroids of the ranges @xmath22 .    with the new opacities we obtain an average metallicity of @xmath12 = 0.0088 and a range of uncertainty of 0.0055 to 0.0133 for the galactic beat cepheids .",
    "this is to be compared with an average @xmath12 = 0.0118 and a range of 0.0073 to 0.0182 with the gn93 opacities .",
    "as noted in paper  i the gn93 average @xmath12 from the galactic beat cepheids is quite low compared to the gn93 value for the sun @xmath23 , the but the ags the average @xmath12 of the beat cepheids is now much closer to the ags value of = 0.0122 .",
    "we note again here that the large , indicated spread @xmath13 to @xmath24 represents a combination of the actual spread in the galactic metallicity , and of the uncertainty that arises from the use of the linear definition of beat cepheids .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we hope to reduce the latter with a survey of full amplitude beat cepheid models @xcite .",
    "[ figp10depth ]    [ figcomp200depth ]",
    "ever since the early days of cepheid modeling , it has been customary to approximate cepheids with envelope models of uniform composition , because the pulsation is largely confined to the outer parts of the stars .",
    "one thus imposes a rigid core of radius @xmath25 at some temperature @xmath26 , located outside the burning region where the luminosity @xmath27 is constant .",
    "this approximation has been justified on the one hand , because the radial displacement eigenvectors for the low lying pulsation modes decay rapidly inward and one therefore sets @xmath28 at @xmath29 , and , on the other hand , because the computed periods are found not to change much when one varies the depth of the envelope models . however , for the petersen diagrams we require a higher relative accuracy ( @xmath30 ) in the periods , as we now discuss .",
    "r r r r r r  @xmath2 [ d ] &  @xmath31/   &  @xmath32/  &  @xmath33 [ k ]   &   @xmath34[10@xmath35 cm ] + 0.5 & 3.09 & 154 & 6882 & 6.0821 + 1.0 & 3.63 & 347 & 6612 & 9.8743 + 2.0 & 4.32 & 805 & 6407 & 16.0227 + 4.0 & 5.14 & 1806 & 6175 & 25.8364 + 7.0 & 5.93 & 3422 & 5982 & 37.8964 +    [ tab2 ]    a reexamination of this assumption shows a breakdown for models with low periods and high @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that in this regime the periods , and concomitantly the period ratios , exhibit an uncomfortable dependence on @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , for the lowest periods there is a poor leveling off even with @xmath26 up to ( perhaps unreasonably large ) values of 5.5@xmath36k which is beyond the temperature up to which one can neglect nuclear burning and spatial composition inhomogeneities .",
    "this @xmath26 dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figp10depth ] , which plots the period ratios @xmath1 @xmath26 for a sequence of 5 models ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) that have been chosen with a composition of @xmath37 and @xmath38 and that are all located at the high temperature side of the region where both the fundamental and the first overtone modes are linearly unstable .",
    "the fundamental periods of the sequences are @xmath2 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 4.0 , and 7.0d , respectively .",
    "the shape for the leveling off is found to be the same for all sequences , but while the variation in @xmath1 remains within an acceptable range for the long period models , this is not the case for the short period models .",
    "for example , in the 4d sequence a change from @xmath26 = 2.5 @xmath39 to 3.0 @xmath39k leads to an increase of @xmath1 of less than 0.0002 , but for the 0.5d sequence the same change results in an increase of @xmath1 of 0.0035 .",
    "this is a large amount if one considers the petersen diagram of fig .",
    "[ figags ] .",
    "furthermore , for the low period models the leveling off is not complete even by the time one reaches @xmath40k .    in fig .",
    "[ figplotall ] we present some other relevant properties of the sequence of models from table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "thus the top panel displays the models in the @xmath41 @xmath42 plane , and reveals a very similar structure for the 5 models and demonstrates that nothing special is occurring for the 0.5d models .",
    "the middle ( b ) and bottom ( c ) panels exhibit the inverse of the sound speed radius , @xmath43 , and relative radius ( @xmath44 ) , respectively , where @xmath34 is the equilibrium stellar radius .",
    "the dots correspond to the location of the rigid inner core @xmath25 , defined to lie at @xmath45k in these models . in actual radius ,",
    "the low period models are much deeper , but this is not the case in relative radius .",
    "the reason for presenting these quantities is that the fundamental period @xmath2 is roughly proportional to the stellar sound traversal time @xmath46 the combined effect of the high sound speed in the stellar core and the decay to zero of the eigenvectors cause the contribution from the neglected penetration of the core to be very small in general .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ figplotall](b ) that the contribution to the period from a deepening of the envelope by @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 , is larger for the long period models .",
    "however , when one considers it relative to the period , one finds a much larger contribution for the envelope models with the smaller periods .",
    "for example , from the figure we infer that in the 7.0d model a small change of 10@xmath49 cm in @xmath25 , @xmath50 , would cause an increase of @xmath2 by @xmath51d , a @xmath52 0.07% relative period change . in the 0.5d model",
    "the same change of @xmath25 , @xmath53 , would cause a considerable @xmath521 % change in the period .",
    "fortunately , an accuracy in the pulsation periods of a percent or less is generally obtainable and sufficient for most purposes , so that envelope models are therefore quite adequate . here , however , one puts higher demands on the cepheid models , because one wants to extract a cepheid s metallicity from its location in the petersen diagrams , for which a relative accuracy of @xmath54 is necessary .    in fig .",
    "[ figcomp200depth ] we present a composite petersen diagram that compares beat cepheid models in which the depth is set at our standard @xmath55 k ( solid lines ) with those at @xmath56 k ( dashed lines ) .",
    "one notices that the most unreliable models are to be found in the high @xmath0 , low period domain .",
    "luckily , the vast majority of the observed beat cepheids avoid the regime in which the uncertainties are largest .",
    "[ figcomp200depth ] shows that one would be ill advised to use envelope models for the @xmath57d stars that are found in the smc ( @xcite ) . for these beat cepheids",
    "it is necessary to use models that extend deeper , if not full stellar models .",
    "this is , of course , a much harder problem , in that it requires the inclusion of nuclear burning and of the spatial composition variations that occur during stellar evolution . in other words , one needs a stellar evolution code that incorporates a linearization to compute the fully nonadiabatic pulsation frequencies with a time - dependent mixing length recipe to capture the pulsation ",
    "convection interaction .",
    "we have computed the beat cepheid models that make up the composite petersen diagrams as a function of metallicity @xmath0 with the @xcite solar mixture .",
    "this change causes a noticeable reduction of @xmath52 25 - 30 % in the average @xmath12 of the four galaxies in which a sizable number of beat cepheids are known .",
    "it considerably improves the agreement between the average galactic metallicity and the sun s metallicity over what was obtained with the gn93 abundances .    while the elemental mixture of the low @xmath0 stars is most likely not quite solar , this is the best approximation we can use in the absence of detailed determinations of chemical compositions from high resolutoin spectra of such stars .",
    "because we needed to construct beat cepheid models down to periods as short as 0.5d as have been found in the smc by @xcite , we have been led to reexamine the accuracy of commonly used envelope models for cepheid stars .",
    "we find that because of the high accuracy demands of petersen diagrams such envelope models become inadequate for short period , high @xmath0 cepheids .",
    "good fortune has it though that the higher @xmath0 beat cepheids in the galaxy and in m33 have longer periods , and that the beat cepheids with smaller periods are observed in the lower metallicity magellanic clouds",
    ". thus the vast majority of the known beat cepheids avoid to some extent the troublesome region of uncertainty of envelope models .",
