    "in the last few years our understanding of exclusive hadronic processes at high transfer momentum , in the framework of perturbative qcd , has improved ( for a comprehensive review and further references see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical models , based essentially on factorization ideas , have been elaborated and refined .",
    "the main ingredients of these models ( which from now on we shall indicate as pqcd models ) can be summarized as follows : the amplitude for a given exclusive process is obtained by convoluting two well distinct contributions : the first coming from the hard scattering among the partonic constituents of the involved hadrons and the second from the subsequent , soft processes which lead to hadronization .",
    "the hard scattering can be described by means of perturbative qcd techniques , representing , in first approximation , each participating hadron by its valence constituents , assumed collinear with the parent hadron and among themselves . as for the soft processes ,",
    "their treatment is outside the possibilities of perturbative methods and alternative approaches ( like qcd  sum rules methods or lattice calculations ) are required ; in practice , they appear in the so called hadronic distribution amplitudes ( @xmath1 ) which describe , for each hadron ( and independently of the particular process under consideration ) , how its momentum is shared among the valence constituents .",
    "although a complete , formal proof of the validity of these factorization procedures is still lacking , at least for exclusive processes , there is enough theoretical work which supports these models @xcite .",
    "as it should be clear , pqcd models acquire full validity only at very high transfer momentum ; however , it is not yet clear what that means in practice ( that is , at what @xmath2 scale we expect these models to become reliable ) .",
    "this is a controversial point @xcite , even if very recently new developments seem to justify the applicability of the models also for not so high momenta @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we must not forget that all the cross sections for exclusive processes behave , at high @xmath2 , as an inverse power of @xmath2 .",
    "this power increases with the number of valence constituents involved in the process and makes more difficult , from an experimental point of view , to distinguish and measure these increasingly rare events from the bulk of the inclusive processes .",
    "we may then summarize the situation as follows : on one hand , theoretical models are surely under better control at very high @xmath2 but , on the other hand , almost all the experimental information presently at our disposal falls in a range of @xmath2 which , while not completely out of reach of pqcd techniques , it is not fully recognized as an ideal laboratory for perturbative models . in particular , it is not clear the role played by higher order corrections ( which are reflected in several possible modifications of the basic pqcd models ) .",
    "unfortunately , the implementation of these higher twist contributions is quite intricate .",
    "it follows from what we said that a complementary , theoretical and phenomenological analysis of all the presently available experimental measurements would be of great help in clarifying and improving pqcd models .",
    "thus it is very useful and important to undertake all the possible efforts in order to shed light on controversial points and improve our understanding of exclusive processes .",
    "we should also bear in mind that presently only for a few , relatively simple processes , calculations have been performed .",
    "this is due to the increasing complexity of calculations when more and more hadrons ( and , as a consequence , partonic constituents ) are involved in the process .",
    "when compared with the experimental results ( all of which , with the possible exception of the proton form factor , are at intermediate values of @xmath2 ) , these calculations show several successes but also some failures .",
    "most of these failures can be attributed to violations of the so called helicity selection rules @xcite ( which are a specific property of pqcd models , valid to all orders in the strong coupling constant perturbative expansion ) and their overcoming requires the introduction of higher twist effects .",
    "several attempts have been made in order to implement the original pqcd models taking into account higher order contributions , like higher valence fock states @xcite , transverse momentum effects @xcite , @xmath3 angular momentum components in hadron wave functions @xcite , constituent quarks mass effects @xcite , diquark correlations inside baryons @xcite .    for constituent quark",
    "mass effects , in particular , a number of calculations @xcite have been performed for several experimentally observed processes , some of which are allowed in pqcd models while others are forbidden by the helicity selection rules . in these calculations the elementary hadron constituents are given a mass , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hadron mass and @xmath6 is the ( light - cone ) fraction of the hadron momentum carried by the @xmath7-th constituent , opportunely weighted ( in the convolution integral ) by the corresponding hadron distribution amplitude .",
    "this effective mass could take into account ( in a global way ) several higher order effects which have been neglected in the ordinary pqcd models .",
    "although from a formal point of view this approach requires further justifications , it offers a relatively simple , parameter free , means for practical calculations .",
    "the results obtained this way can be compared with the lowest order pqcd results , and , as we shall also see in the following , lead to predictions for several effects that can be experimentally tested at the present time or in the near future ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "few years ago carimalo @xcite considered mass corrections effects on the polar angular distribution of baryon  antibaryon pairs produced in the exclusive decay of the @xmath8 . as it can easily be seen , pqcd models predict , due to the helicity selection rules , a distribution of the type @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the polar angle which specifies the direction of motion of the produced baryon in the @xmath8 rest  frame .",
    "although experimental results are available only for a few baryons @xcite and are in some cases affected by large statistical errors , there are clear indications that the angular distributions behave rather as @xmath11 , with , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is a factor which can be expressed from the helicity amplitudes for the decay process , as we shall see in detail in the next section .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , mass corrections can in principle explain why @xmath16 and lead to a better agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results .",
    "furthermore , since the parameter @xmath14 is given as a ratio of squared helicity amplitudes , it is independent of the exact value of the baryon decay constant , and of several `` fine tuning '' details of the models ( for example , how to treat the strong coupling constant in the convolution integrals ) ; as such , their effects may be neglected almost completely , as will be clarified by our explicit calculations .    the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are obtained using a non  relativistic bound  state model both for the decaying @xmath8 and the produced baryons . however , while this approximation is well grounded for heavy quark bound states , like the @xmath8 , it can be questionable for light hadrons . in ref .",
    "@xcite the proton decay constant was consistently fixed in order to reproduce the @xmath17 decay width . a different , widely used approach ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) is to tentatively fix once and for all the baryon decay constant from qcd sum rules and consider different modelizations for the baryon distribution amplitudes , including the non - relativistic , qcd sum rules inspired and asymptotic ones .",
    "a lattice calculation of the baryon decay constant in the nucleon case is consistent , within the inherent systematic uncertainties of the models , with that of qcd sum rules @xcite . in this context , the non ",
    "relativistic @xmath1 seems to systematically underestimate absolute quantities ( _ i.e. _ , not obtained as ratios of amplitudes ) like the decay widths for charmonium exclusive decays , or the hadron form factors , by two or even three orders of magnitude , when compared to available experimental results ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "it is then quite reasonable to expect that the use of more refined distribution amplitudes could lead to significant modifications in the predicted values for @xmath14 .",
    "there is also a more specific reason to believe that the dependence of @xmath14 on the @xmath1 s may be not negligible : the expression of @xmath14 is given as a function of squared helicity amplitudes with different values of the constituent helicities .",
    "then , the use of distribution amplitudes which , like those derived from qcd sum rules , seem to indicate an unusual sharing of the hadron momentum among its constituents , can substantially modify different helicity amplitudes .",
    "based on these motivations , in the rest of this paper we shall present a new derivation of the parameter @xmath14 , generalizing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of a generic hadron distribution amplitude .",
    "the only restriction on the @xmath1 is that it must satisfy general symmetry properties .",
    "this allows us to compare the results obtained using different @xmath1 s and possibly to get useful informations on them , independently of the way the baryon decay constant has been fixed .",
    "we wish also to recall that an alternative approach for the calculation of @xmath14 has been proposed by parisi and kada . in ref .",
    "@xcite these authors evaluated the strong contribution to @xmath14 for the octet baryons , in the framework of a quark-(scalar)diquark model for the baryon structure .",
    "diquarks are another possible way of taking into account higher order corrections ( in particular correlations between two valence quarks in the baryon ) .",
    "they have been applied , with good success , to several exclusive processes at intermediate values of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it was stressed by carimalo and by glashow _",
    "_ @xcite and will also be argued in the following , that electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "corrections to @xmath14 might be by no means negligible .    the main problem with the e.m .",
    "corrections is that they involve the e.m .",
    "form factors of the octet baryons , for which calculations including mass corrections have not yet been done . only for the nucleon , in the non relativistic approximation",
    ", there is a theoretical evaluation @xcite . in the other cases we are forced to give for these corrections estimates based on the available experimental information .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we derive a general expression for the angular distribution of the baryons produced in @xmath18 decays . in section iii",
    "we concentrate on the strong contribution to @xmath14 , which controls the @xmath19 angular distribution , giving a derivation of the helicity amplitudes required for its calculation . in section iv we discuss in detail the results obtained and their dependence from some subtleties of the models that in general , while not modifying qualitatively the conclusions , can substantially affect the numerical results , in particular for absolute quantities like decay widths . in section v we give a detailed analysis of electromagnetic corrections , trying to estimate , when possible , upper bounds on the consequent overall modification of @xmath14 both from experimental and theoretical information .",
    "finally , our conclusions and future perspectives are discussed in section vi .",
    "let us consider a @xmath8 particle , produced in @xmath21 colliders with unpolarized beams , which subsequently decays into a baryon ",

    "however , since we cover a large range of possibilities for the strong contribution , we think the order of magnitude of e.m .",
    "corrections can be safely estimated to be of 5 - 10 % , for the proton .",
    "these estimates must be taken as upper limits .",
    "[ two ] shows the variation of @xmath264 as a function of the ratio @xmath262 and for some indicative @xmath1 s .",
    "the central value correspond to the possible expected behavior , @xmath257 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ two ] that our previous conclusions are not greatly modified ; only for big variations of the behavior of the @xmath262 ratio from the empirical one , we can have relevant differences .",
    "our conclusion is that the full range of variation of @xmath264 with respect to @xmath266 is of the order of 0 - 15 % .    in the case of the neutron",
    "the experimental information is also poorer than for the proton .",
    "we limit ourselves to extrapolate well known phenomenological behavior of the neutron form factors to the kinematic region @xmath267 . from this point of view",
    ", we can at first assume @xmath268 and @xmath269 , at @xmath227 .",
    "the last two columns of table  v show the corresponding results for @xmath270 and its percentual variation with respect to the pure strong contribution @xmath271 .",
    "we see that this time e.m .",
    "corrections induce a decrease of @xmath270 , because @xmath272 is negative . as for the absolute variation , this is slightly larger than in the proton case , and in the range of 9 - 15 % . even if we do not report here the results , we have analyzed also for the neutron how e.m .",
    "corrections change when @xmath272 and @xmath273 are allowed to vary around the empirical values given above .",
    "we find again a situation similar to that of the proton , possibly with a greater spread of variation .",
    "the study of exclusive processes involving hadrons at high energy scales , in the framework of perturbative qcd models , has made big improvements in the last years . however",
    ", several problems remain open and questionable , given that almost all the experimental information concerning exclusive processes is at intermediate energy scales .",
    "in such situation , several higher order corrections may not be negligible and can contribute significantly , at least for those processes that are forbidden to lowest order in the pqcd models , but are experimentally well established .",
    "unfortunately the implementation of these higher twist effects is very intricate , and only very recently significant progress has been made . among these contributions ,",
    "mass corrections effects for the valence constituent quarks of the light hadrons involved are very promising .",
    "in fact , if from one hand a more rigorous theoretical explanation of their exact origin is required and auspicable , on the other hand their implementation is relatively easy and free of ambiguities : once their contribution is taken into account there are no free parameters to be fixed , and everything goes on without any further assumptions .",
    "a number of exclusive processes ( in particular charmonium decays ) have been analyzed in this framework in the last years , and several interesting consequences , experimentally testable at present or in the near future , have been proposed to check the validity of this model as compared to the pqcd ones or to alternative models including higher order effects . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the effects of mass corrections on the angular distribution of octet baryon pairs created in @xmath8 decays . even if experimental measurements of these angular distributions have , for the moment , a low statistics ( at least in some cases ) we hope they can be improved in the near future .",
    "this was also the subject of an earlier paper by carimalo .",
    "however carimalo used , as a first approach , a simplified , non - relativistic model for the produced baryons . over time",
    "it has been shown that the behavior of light hadrons , like the octet baryons , probably demands more accurate models of the baryon distribution amplitudes , like those we have considered here in a more general context . from a theoretical point of view , there are several reasons why the study of these angular distributions is interesting .",
    "first of all they are governed by a parameter which is given as a ratio of helicity amplitudes . as such",
    ", this parameter results to be quite independent of some details of qcd models presently at our disposal , details which are not fully understood and can modify sizably the numerical results ( albeit not the qualitative ones ) .",
    "secondly , as we have shown , this parameter is sufficiently sensitive to the precise form of the distribution amplitudes to allow a discrimination among their main features , as soon as higher precision measurements will be available .",
    "considering all the available models for the distribution amplitudes ( mainly based on qcd sum rules calculations ) we have shown indeed that the spread on the @xmath14 values due to the change of the @xmath1 is of the order of 10 - 20 % , in the nucleon case .",
    "little is known about the @xmath1 s of the other octet baryons .",
    "whenever possible , our calculations show an even larger dependence of @xmath14 from the exact form of the @xmath1 , varying in the range of 20 - 50 % . therefore a more accurate measurement of @xmath14 could allow us to discriminate among different model @xmath1 s .",
    "we have also considered in detail the role played by electromagnetic corrections .",
    "in fact , we can not evaluate exactly these corrections at present .",
    "however , we give reasonable upper limit estimates of these contributions in the nucleon case , making use of all the possible available informations , both theoretical and experimental .      on the contrary",
    ", we estimate from a phenomenological analysis that e.m .",
    "corrections could be of the order of 5 - 10 % for the proton and of 10 - 15% for the neutron . in the proton case e.m .",
    "corrections tend to increase the value of @xmath14 , while for the neutron they produce the opposite effect . in both cases",
    ", these corrections could be comparable to the modifications induced in the pure strong contribution @xmath72 by different choices of the @xmath1 .",
    "we can say very little about e.m .",
    "corrections for the other octet baryons , since little is known about them , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "so we limit ourselves to report , when possible , the pure strong contribution .",
    "of course , only more precise experimental information on the e.m .",
    "baryon form factors could allow to evaluate the exact contribution of e.m .",
    "alternatively , the form factors could be evaluated in the framework of our model ( including mass corrections ) , and a more consistent , theoretical result could be obtained .",
    "we leave this as a subject for future work .",
