    "quantum fourier transform ( qft ) plays essential roles in various quantum algorithms such as shor s algorithms @xcite and hidden subgroup problems @xcite .",
    "inspired by the exponential speed - up of shor s polynomial algorithm for factorization @xcite , many people investigated the problem of efficient realization of qft in a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "up to now , many improvements have been made . in @xcite ,",
    "moore and nilsson showed that qft can be parallelized to linear depth in a quantum network , and upper bound of the circuit depth was obtained by cleve and watrous @xcite for computing qft with a fixed error . in @xcite the actual time - cost for performing qft in the quantum network was examined .",
    "further , blais @xcite designed an optimized quantum network with respect to time - cost for qft .    in practice ,",
    "the decoherence problem induced by the unavoidable coupling of quantum system with the environment have to be considered in circuit design for qft over a quantum network .",
    "if no measure is taken , decoherence will destroy the encoded quantum information .",
    "many methods have been proposed to suppress decoherence in a quantum system , among which , an important scheme is to encode the quantum information into the decoherence - free subspaces or subsystems ( dfs ) @xcite of quantum system .",
    "theoretically , dfss are completely isolated from the noises @xcite .",
    "a large amount of discussions about dfs have appeared in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will take advantage of the decoherence - free subspaces to develop a novel scheme for performing qft in a quantum computer .",
    "the circuits designed in this way have the robustness against noise in the procedure of implementing qft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , some notations and the preliminary knowledge on dfs and qft will be reviewed ; in sec.iii , general method will be introduced for implementing qft in dfs ; in sec.iv , circuits will be designed to perform qft in the dfs of a quantum network with respect to weak collective decoherence ( wcd ) and strong collective decoherence ( scd ) respectively ; in sec.v , the efficiency of the circuit and possible improvements will be discussed ; finally , a conclusion will be made in sec.vi .",
    "suppose the quantum system * s * under consideration is coupled to an environment * e*. the overall system is governed by the hamiltonian in the form of @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 are operators acting on the state space @xmath2 of * s*(*e * ) , and the index set @xmath3 contains all the possible couplings between the system and the environment .",
    "assume @xmath4 span a @xmath5-closed associate algebra @xmath6 . according to @xcite",
    ", @xmath6 is isomorphic to a direct sum of @xmath7 complex matrix algebras , each with multiplicity @xmath8 @xcite    @xmath9    where the index set @xmath10 labels all the irreducible components of @xmath6 .",
    "correspondingly , the system hilbert space @xmath11 can be decomposed into a similar form    @xmath12    all the subsystem spaces @xmath13 in the right hand side of eq.([eq3 ] ) correspond to decoherence - free subsystems of the quantum system * s*. particularly , @xmath14 gives a decoherence - free subspace of the quantum system * s * when @xmath15 .",
    "quantum network under collective decoherence ( cd ) provides a nice paradigm for the dfss . roughly speaking , all qubits of a quantum network under cd",
    "are coupled to the environment in the same manner . in the literature@xcite ,",
    "two types of cd , weak collective decoherence ( wcd ) and strong collective decoherence ( scd ) , are frequently discussed .",
    "scd is defined as the decoherence due to the interaction hamiltonian    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 represents the pauli matrix @xmath19 that corresponds to the local operation on the @xmath20 qubit .",
    "if only one term appears in the right hand side of eq.(4 ) , i.e. the system is coupled to the environment only in one direction , the induced decoherence is called wcd . without loss of generality , the hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath21    next , we give a brief description of qft implemented over an @xmath22-qubit quantum network .",
    "mathematically , the quantum fourier transformation @xmath23 can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath24    denote the state of the quantum network by the qubit string @xmath25 in which the @xmath26 qubit is at the state @xmath27 .",
    "the transformation @xmath23 can be realized by applying the following sequence of quantum gates ( all the gate sequences in this paper are operated from the right to left one by one )    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    eq.([eq8 ] ) includes two classes of elementary quantum gates , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the local hadamard gate @xmath30 represents    @xmath32\\ ] ]    over @xmath33 qubit .",
    "the controlled - phase - shift gate @xmath31 represents the action    @xmath34\\ ] ]    over @xmath20 ( control ) and @xmath35 ( target ) qubits .",
    "in addition , there are three important elementary gates that will be used in this paper .",
    "the controlled - not gate @xmath36 flips the @xmath35 qubit ( target qubit ) when the @xmath20 qubit ( control qubit ) is at the state @xmath37 , and nothing is done when the control qubit is at the state @xmath38 .",
    "the rotation gate @xmath39 realizes the unitary transformation over @xmath33 qubit :    @xmath40 realizes the rotation @xmath41 over @xmath35 qubit ( target qubit ) when the state on the @xmath20 qubit ( control qubit ) is @xmath37 , and nothing is done when the state on the @xmath20 qubit ( control qubit ) is @xmath38 .",
    "more details about dfs and qft can be found in ref . @xcite and the references therein .",
    "in the following parts of this paper , we focus the study on implementing qft over decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "if not claimed , the abbreviation dfs will indicate only the decoherence - free subspace .",
    "suppose @xmath42 is an @xmath8 dimensional dfs of the quantum system * s * , then one can select @xmath43}$ ] orthonormal states in @xmath42 to construct at most @xmath44 $ ] new qubits . for clarity ,",
    "we call these qubits logical - qubits , and the original qubits physical - qubits .    next , we will discuss how to realize a robust qft algorithm over these logical - qubits .",
    "similar to ( [ eq6 ] ) , we define the qft over a dfs by    @xmath45 are basis states of the logical - qubits .    the basic idea for realizing @xmath46 is as follows .",
    "notice that the two classes of gates @xmath30 and @xmath31 play the central roles in the qft @xcite , we will construct correspondingly two similar classes of quantum gates for implementing qft in a dfs , denoted by one - logical - qubit gate @xmath47 acting on the @xmath33 logical - qubit and two - logical - qubit gate @xmath48 acting on the @xmath20 and @xmath35 logical - qubits respectively .",
    "these two classes of gates should fulfil two requirements : one is that they are invariant operators on the state space of the logical - qubits ; the other is that they operate on the logical - qubits in the same manner as @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the physical - qubits .",
    "similar to the general qft described in eq.([eq6 ] ) , we can realize @xmath46 by applying the following sequence of quantum gates    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    gate sequence ( [ eq13 ] ) provides us the general strategy for designing a circuit to implement qft over the dfs in a quantum system .",
    "concretely , let @xmath51 be @xmath8 orthonormal states in the dfs @xmath42 , and @xmath52 be @xmath53 orthonormal states in the orthogonal complementary space of @xmath42 .",
    "then between @xmath54 and the natural basis @xmath55 of space @xmath56 there exists an unitary transformation @xmath57 , i.e.    @xmath58    where    @xmath59    let @xmath60 be an integer no greater than @xmath61 .",
    "here we choose @xmath62 to construct @xmath60 logical - qubits for performing m - qubit qft over the dfs , and rewrite them as    @xmath63    then    @xmath64    similarly , we have    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    where @xmath67 .    from eqs.([eq19]-[eq21 ] ) , we can see that if @xmath57 can be constructed by elementary gates , then @xmath68 and @xmath69 are feasible realizations for the two gates @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus the realization of the unitary transformation @xmath57 is crucial for building the circuits to implement qft in a dfs .",
    "the remainder tasks , then , are to find the transformation @xmath57 in eq.([eq15 ] ) and build a circuit to realize it . from the theory of universal quantum computation@xcite , any unitary operator can be constructed by a sequence of universal elementary gates . in most cases",
    "it is not easy to obtain such explicit decompositions .",
    "whereas , as will be shown in the next section , it is possible to build up a circuit for @xmath70 over the quantum network under collective decoherence with a finite number of elementary gates .",
    "in the quantum networks under wcd , nontrivial dfs exists only when the original network has no less than two physical - qubits @xcite . for the simplest case ,",
    "the dfs in a two - qubit quantum network under wcd is spanned by the orthonormal states @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite , with which one can build up one logical - qubit , i.e.    @xmath73    and    @xmath74    for a @xmath75-qubit quantum network under wcd , we use the orthonormal states @xmath76 , where @xmath77 represents the @xmath26 logical - qubit extracted from the @xmath78 and @xmath79 physical - qubits , to construct the circuit for robust qft .",
    "it can be verified that all these states are contained in the biggest dfs .    over these logical - qubits ,",
    "it is observed that @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be directly constructed from a sequence of elementary gates as follows ( the circuits are given in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] ) :    @xmath80     in quantum network under wcd .",
    "the element with @xmath81 corresponds to a controlled - not gate with control on the filled circle and target on the @xmath81 .",
    "( in this paper , all the different logical - qubits are labelled by numbers in the first column of the figures , while the individual physical - qubits are labelled by the numbers in the second column . ) ]    and    @xmath82     over the @xmath20 and @xmath83 logical - qubits in quantum network under wcd . ]",
    "being able to perform the gates @xmath47 and @xmath48 introduced above with elementary gates , one can now integrate the circuit for an n - qubit qft over a 2n - physical - qubit quantum network under wcd .",
    "the transformation @xmath70 can be realized by replacing the @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the gate sequence ( [ eq13 ] ) with those in eqs.([eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath84 .",
    "observing that the term @xmath85 commutes with @xmath86 when @xmath87 and commutes with @xmath88 when @xmath89 or @xmath90 , we have    @xmath91    and    @xmath92    therefore , we can choose @xmath93 as the unitary transformation @xmath57 in eq.([eq15 ] ) :    @xmath94    consider the three - qubit qft as a simple example , the transformation @xmath95 can be realized by applying @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the sequence as follows ( see the circuit in fig.[fig3 ] ) :    @xmath96    ; the gates @xmath47 and @xmath48 are those given in fig.1 and fig.2 . ]",
    "it is more complicated to design the circuit for qft over quantum networks under scd than wcd .",
    "the corresponding condition for the existence of a dfs is more critical .",
    "quantum network with four physical - qubits is of the smallest scale to ensure the existence of a nontrivial dfs , which is spanned by two orthonormal states @xcite    @xmath97    naturally , @xmath98 and @xmath99 form one logical - qubit . by dividing the physical qubits into 4-qubit units",
    ", one can use the canonical basis @xmath100 , where @xmath101 represents the @xmath26 logical - qubit extracted from the @xmath102 to @xmath103 physical - qubits , to construct @xmath22 logical - qubits in a @xmath104-physical - qubit quantum network under scd .    to perform qft over the logical - qubits obtained above , it is still crucial to design the circuits for the corresponding two classes of gates @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",
    "we directly give the form of unitary transformation @xmath57 in eq.([eq15 ] ) , then the gates @xmath47 and @xmath48 are obtained according to sec.iii .",
    "let @xmath105 be an unitary transformation on the physical - qubits from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , which is realized by applying the sequence of elementary gates as follows ( see the circuits for the transformation @xmath105 and its inverse in fig.[fig4 ] ) :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "then , in a @xmath104-physical - qubit quantum network , one of the feasible realization of the transformation @xmath57 is :    @xmath112     corresponding to the case that implementing qft in a quantum network under scd .",

    "the encoding efficiency of quantum algorithms over the dfs of an @xmath22-qubit quantum network , say @xmath118 , is defined as the ratio of the number of logical - qubits to that of physical - qubits .",

    "therefore , it is possible to design a more efficient circuit for realizing qft over the dfs of some quantum network under collective decoherence .",
    "however , our circuits are scalable for they are relatively easy to be realized for large scale robust qft over quantum networks .",
    "consequently , there is a trade - off between the encoding efficiency and circuit complexity .",
