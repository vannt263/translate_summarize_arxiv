    "relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven , the qgp machine , has provided a new opportunity to explore the physics of the dense gluonic state at small bjorken s @xmath0 in incoming hadrons , which is called color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite . analyses of ( e.g. ) deeply inelastic scatterings ( dis ) at hera@xcite and heavy - ion collisions at rhic@xcite support the phenomenology based on the cgc picture .",
    "a recent highlight is the inclusion of the running coupling effects in the balitsky - kovchegov equation ( the rcbk equation )  @xcite , which controls the @xmath0-evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath1 in the incoming hadron ( @xmath2 is the transverse momentum and @xmath3 is the rapidity ) , which is obtained as the fourier - transform of the ` dipole scattering amplitude ' @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the transverse size of a dipole .",
    "the rcbk equation has been confronted with the global analysis of dis@xcite as well as with the data obtained in proton - proton ( pp ) , proton - nucleus ( pa ) and nucleus - nucleus  ( aa ) collisions @xcite ( see @xcite for recent progress ) .",
    "our goal is to elaborate a detailed model for particle productions in forward regions at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , by applying the gluon distribution obtained from the rcbk equation .",
    "with the dis data for @xmath6 accumulated at hera , one can constrain the numerical solution of the rcbk equation quite accurately .",
    "this program was accomplished in @xcite by choosing an initial condition at @xmath7 as ( e.g. ) @xmath8 \\ ; . \\label{eq : ic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] among several parameter sets now available , we adopt here the aamqs parameter set @xmath9 ( @xmath10 gev@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 gev , @xmath15=1 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will try a new initial condition , motivated by the mclerran - venugopalan model with the running coupling modification ( rcmv ) @xcite : @xmath16   \\ ; , \\label{eq : icrcmv}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] with @xmath18 with @xmath19 ,  and @xmath20 is fixed by requiring that maximum value of @xmath21 be unity .",
    "we have set @xmath22 for @xmath5 larger than this maximum point .",
    "for the rcmv initial condition we use the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 with @xmath26 gev@xmath11 as a trial .      in particle productions at very forward",
    "rapidities @xmath27 one can probe the saturation regime of one of the colliding hadrons .",
    "in this situation a factorized formula for the cross section is proposed by dumitru , hayashigaki , and jalilian - marian ( dhj)@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the collinear distribution function for the large-@xmath30 parton @xmath31 , @xmath32 describes the small-@xmath33 unintegrated gluon distribution , and @xmath34 deals with the high-@xmath35 fragmentation of a parton @xmath31 into a hadron @xmath9 with the momentum fraction @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is introduced to absorb the higher - order contributions . in aa collisions , @xmath29 and @xmath32",
    "are to be generalized to those for nuclei .    the formula ( [ eq : dhj ] )",
    "was applied  @xcite to forward hadron productions in d - au collisions at rhic , with adopting a certain cgc model for @xmath32 .",
    "the larger gluon density in a nucleus is advantageous for probing the saturation effects .",
    "recently albacete and marquet@xcite exploited the rcbk equation to improve the @xmath32 part theoretically . assuming a homogeneous nucleus in the transverse plane",
    ", they obtained the best description to date for the rapidity and momentum dependence of the d - au data at rhic .      for more quantitative study , we need a nuclear model including the impact - parameter dependence and initial fluctuations . in a mc implementation developed in @xcite , nucleons are randomly sampled according to the woods - saxon density in an event - by - event basis , and the initial saturation momentum @xmath38 in ( [ eq : ic ] ) and ( [ eq : icrcmv ] ) is taken to be @xmath39 at each transverse coordinate , where @xmath40 is the number of nucleons in the dense target within a transverse area @xmath41 .",
    "we apply locally in the transverse plane the numerical solutions for the rcbk equation with different initial values of @xmath38 .",
    "such an approach has been pursued within the so - called @xmath42 factorization approximation for aa collisions , which reproduces successfully the centrality dependence of the hadron multiplicity at rhic and the lhc@xcite .",
    "here we combine the dhj formula with the rcbk evolution in the mc implementation ( mc - dhj / rcbk ) .",
    "that is , we compute particle productions _ at each transverse grid _ @xmath43 using the dhj formula ( [ eq : dhj ] ) with @xmath1 numerically obtained from @xmath38 at grid @xmath43 determined by the mc code : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the thickness function on the dilute side .",
    "we stress as an advantage of this approach that _ there is no more additional parameter _ after fitting pp collisions .",
    "we comment also that the mc implementation allows us to study the initial fluctuations@xcite .",
    "( solid ) and rcmv ( dashed ) to the data observed at rhic .",
    "the @xmath37 factor is chosen as @xmath46 for charged particles ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 for @xmath49 in pp and d - au collisions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   ( solid ) and rcmv ( dashed ) to the data observed at rhic .",
    "the @xmath37 factor is chosen as @xmath46 for charged particles ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 for @xmath49 in pp and d - au collisions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we use for @xmath29 and @xmath34 the cteq6 m nlo pdf  @xcite and dss nlo fragmentation functions  @xcite , respectively , and set the factorization scale to @xmath50 .",
    "we remark that an oscillation appears in @xmath51 for smaller @xmath38 when a sharp cutoff for the running coupling @xmath52 $ ] is adopted at @xmath15 .",
    "thus we tried a smooth cutoff @xmath53 $ ] where constant @xmath54 is adjusted to make @xmath55 as @xmath56 in the rcbk evolution in the case of the rcmv initial condition .    in figure  1 ,",
    "transverse momentum distributions of negatively charged hadrons @xmath47 at pseudo - rapidities @xmath57 and 3.2 from brahms  @xcite and neutral pions @xmath49 at @xmath58 from star  @xcite in pp and d - au collisions at @xmath59 gev are compared to our results .",
    "the aamqs set @xmath9 with @xmath46 ( 0.5 ) describes the forward particle multiplicities of @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) very nicely in pp and d - au collisions at the same time without changing any parameters in the model . on the other hand ,",
    "the rcmv initial condition with our current parameter set with @xmath46 ( 0.5 ) for @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) leads to a good agreement with the data for d - au collisions ,    r0.5        but not for pp collisions .",
    "it is very interesting to do global analysis of hera data by using rcmv initial condition and fix the parameters .",
    "we will report more systematic analyses on the parameter dependence elsewhere .",
    "finally a result from test calculations of the mc - dhj / rcbk at extremely forward rapidity @xmath60 for pp collisions at @xmath61 tev , which is measured in lhcf experiment @xcite , is shown in figure  2 .",
    "one expects that dependence of the rcbk evolution on initial conditions will become weaker at higher energies , but we see that the result is still relatively sensitive to the initial conditions .",
