    "the distinctive features of quantum mechanics qualifies one to carry out many information processing tasks which can not be done in a classical way @xcite .",
    "the existence of quantum correlations in a system was considered to be responsible for the advantage of this way of information processing @xcite , and this makes the quantification and understanding of quantum correlations a vital problem needs to be solved .    for a long time , the study of quantum correlations are focused on entanglement @xcite , which has been shown to be a precious resource in quantum information processing ( qip ) , and entanglement exists only in non - separable states . but recent studies revealed that quantumness other than entanglement can also exists in separable states @xcite .",
    "particularly , there are quantum algorithms which outperform their classical counterparts while with vanishing or negligible entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , a more fundamental measure of quantum correlation than that of entanglement , provides speedup for this task .    due to the role it played in qip @xcite , and",
    "its fundamentals in quantum mechanics @xcite , qd has become one of people s research focuses in recent years @xcite .",
    "particularly , as a natural candidate for implementing qip tasks , the spin - chain systems have attracted researcher s great interests , and the behaviors of qd in various spin chains were analyzed @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it has been found that the qd can serve as an efficient quantity for detecting critical points of quantum phase transitions even at finite temperature @xcite , while the entanglement can not achieve the same feat .",
    "different from previous studies which focused on qd behaviors in the spin chain with only homogeneous exchange interactions @xcite , here we go one step further and consider qd behaviors in the heisenberg model with inhomogeneous interactions .",
    "this model can be viewed as a spin chain with spin site imperfection or impurity @xcite , and the strength of interactions between the impurity spin and its neighboring spins can be different from that between the normal spins . here , we will show that while being considered to be an unwanted effects traditionally , the spin impurity can also serve as an efficient way for controlling qd .",
    "particularly , states with considerable amount of qd exists in a wide regime of the spin - impurity - induced inhomogeneous interaction , and this shows the positive side of this unwanted effects .    besides spin impurity , we will also consider the effect of a nonuniform magnetic field on qd in the heisenberg model .",
    "this model describes the situation in which a magnetic impurity is located on one site of the chain , and the entanglement properties in a similar but different model ( i.e. , _ xx _ chain ) has already been discussed @xcite . here",
    ", we will further show that if the magnetic impurity is located on the spin which is being traced out , then the qd between the other two spins can be enhanced asymptotically to its maximal value 1 for the antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "the structure of the following text is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we give a brief review of qd and its quantification based on the discrepancy between two expressions of mutual information extended from classical to quantum system .",
    "then in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , we introduce the spin model we considered and discuss qd behaviors under different system parameters .",
    "finally , we conclude this work with a summary of the main finding in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we recall in this section some basic formalism for qd . up to now",
    ", many measures of qd have been proposed , and they can be classified into two categories in general @xcite .",
    "the first category are those based on the entropic quantities @xcite , while the second category are defined via the geometric approach based on different distance measures @xcite .",
    "we adopt in this work the original definition of qd proposed by ollivier and zurek @xcite . if one denotes the quantum mutual information for a bipartite density matrix @xmath0 as @xmath1 , then the qd can be defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the so - called classical correlation of the following form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the average conditional entropy of the postmeasurement state @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the probability for obtaining the measurement outcome @xmath8 , and the positive operator valued measurements are performed on @xmath9 .",
    "the qd defined above was considered to be potential resource for many qip tasks @xcite , but its closed expression can only be obtained for certain special states @xcite , and it has been shown to be an impossible - to - solve problem for general quantum states @xcite .",
    "our discussion in this paper deals with only qubit states , thus we can resort to numerical methods , and in view of the generally negligible improvement by doing minimization over full povms @xcite , we restrict ourselves to the projective measurements by choosing the measurement operators as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 . moreover , for the two - qubit _ x _ state with elements @xmath13 , the infimum of the conditional entropy in eq .",
    "can be derived as @xcite @xmath14 with the variable @xmath15 in the shannon entropy function @xmath16 being given by @xmath17 ^ 2 +        4(|\\rho_{ab}^{14}|+|\\rho_{ab}^{23}|)^2}}{2}.\\ ] ] thus both @xmath3 and @xmath18 can be derived analytically for this class of states .",
    "we consider in this paper the three - qubit heisenberg chain in the thermodynamic limit with the imposition of the periodic boundary condition . the first case we will discuss is the chain for which the neighboring spins coupled with inhomogeneous strengths , and the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector of pauli matrices , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the coupling strengths , and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "is assumed .",
    "the above model can be viewed as a ring with an spin impurity at site @xmath24 .",
    "when it is thermalized with an external reservoir at temperature @xmath25 , the canonical ensemble can be evaluated by the following density matrix , @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] being the partition function and @xmath28 the boltzman s constant , which will be set to unity in the following text . as @xmath29 represents a thermal state , the qd in this state",
    "is called the thermal quantum discord ( tqd ) @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath30 in eq . can be derived analytically , for which we denote them as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 then @xmath38 .",
    "in the next section , we will compute tqd for the density matrices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath29 with the bipartition @xmath41 , and discuss their behaviors for @xmath42 by changing the system parameters .    besides spin impurity which induces inhomogeneous interactions between the neighboring spins , we consider also the heisenberg model with a magnetic impurity @xcite , which modelling a spin chain with nonuniform magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the nonuniform magnetic field along @xmath45-direction of the first spin .",
    "for this hamiltonian , its eigenvalues are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "its eigenvectors can also be obtained analytically , which are of the following form @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are unnormalized .",
    "the impurity plays an important role in condensed matter physics . we discuss here effects of the spin and magnetic impurities on tqd , and show that while generally being considered to be the unwanted effects , proper engineering of the impurity can also be used to enhance the tqd greatly .",
    "we consider first the case of the spin impurity on tqd .",
    "for the reduced density matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as they are _ x _ states and satisfy the conditions required by eq .",
    ", closed expressions of tqd can be obtained ( we do not list them here for concise of the presentation ) . for @xmath29 with the bipartition @xmath41 , we compute the tqd numerically .    when considering tqd between the impurity spin and the normal spin , the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath55 with different @xmath25 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "first , at absolute zero temperature with @xmath56 , the ground states are the mixtures of @xmath52 if @xmath57 , @xmath58 if @xmath59 , and @xmath60 if @xmath61 , and the tqds are given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively . when @xmath65 , however , the ground states are the mixtures of @xmath52 if @xmath66 , which gives @xmath67 ; and @xmath60 if @xmath68 , which gives @xmath69 .    for finite @xmath25 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , @xmath55 increases with increasing @xmath70 , and when @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we have @xmath69 and @xmath62 , respectively . in order to obtain an intuition about the role of the spin impurity played on enhancing tqd at finite @xmath25 , we define the critical @xmath73 after which @xmath74 .",
    "the numerical fitting results performed in the region of @xmath75 revealed that if @xmath56 , @xmath73 satisfy the power law @xmath76 when @xmath77 , and @xmath78 when @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath65 , we have @xmath79 when @xmath68 , and @xmath80 when @xmath66 .",
    "the above phenomena show that the tqd can be improved greatly compared with that of the homogeneous heisenberg chain ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) , and the spin impurity can serve as an efficient way for tuning tqd even at finite temperature . moreover , it is worthwhile to note that the tqd may be increased by increasing @xmath25 in the region of @xmath59 if @xmath56 , and this peculiar phenomenon has also been observed previously when studying entanglement @xcite .",
    "when considering tqd between the normal spins 2 and 3 at absolute zero temperature with @xmath56 , we have @xmath82 in the regions of @xmath57 and @xmath61 , and @xmath83 in the region @xmath59 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to mixtures of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , for which @xmath86 belongs to one of the bell states and thus the result @xmath83 is understandable @xcite . if @xmath65 , the ground state @xmath87 in the full region of @xmath21 , and thus we always have @xmath82 .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the tqd @xmath88 is reduced with increasing @xmath25 in a wide regime of @xmath21 , and the exception appears at the neighborhood of @xmath61 or @xmath57 for @xmath56 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . for any fixed @xmath25 , @xmath88 can be enhanced asymptotically to the steady - state value @xmath62 when @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , for the same defined @xmath73 above with @xmath56 , we have @xmath90 when @xmath91 , and @xmath92 when @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath65 , we have @xmath94 for @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "all these show again that considerable enhancement of tqd can be achieved by tuning the strength of the inhomogeneous exchange interaction @xmath21 moderately .",
    "we now discuss tqd for @xmath29 with the bipartition @xmath41 . here , we compute @xmath98 numerically , and the corresponding results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . as the qd is nonincreasing by tracing out one qubit @xcite , we have @xmath99 , which can be certified by comparing figs . [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] .    at absolute zero temperature with the addition of @xmath56 , we have @xmath100 when @xmath61 , @xmath101 when @xmath57 , and @xmath102 when @xmath59 . if @xmath65 , however , we have @xmath100 @xmath103 when @xmath68 ( @xmath66 ) . at finite temperature @xmath25 ,",
    "the tqd @xmath98 shows very similar behaviors with that of @xmath104 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , i.e. , it may be enhanced by increasing the absolute value of @xmath21 , and when @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) it arrives at the asymptotic value @xmath105 @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the tqd is reduced by increasing temperature of the reservoir except the special case of @xmath59 and @xmath56 .",
    "for this situation , the interactions between the neighboring spins are completely the same , and the magnetic impurity is assumed to be along @xmath45-direction of the first spin .",
    "we compute the tqd for different spin pairs numerically , and an exemplified plot was displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , from which one can see that with the increasing strength of @xmath44 , @xmath88 approaches to its maximum 1 asymptotically [ @xmath55 with @xmath56 , or @xmath55 and @xmath88 with @xmath65 are always decreased with increasing @xmath44 ] . by tuning strength of a nonuniform magnetic field located on one spin",
    ", one can enhance the tqd between the other two spins .",
    "this phenomenon reflects the remarkable nonlocal feature of quantum mechanics .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated properties of tqd in the heisenberg chain , which is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we considered the case that there are spin site imperfection or magnetic impurity in the chain , and discussed their influence on tqd between the chosen spin pairs . by comparing its behaviors under different system parameters",
    ", we showed that just as every coin has two sides , the unwanted effects of the inhomogeneous exchange interaction induced by the spin impurity can be used to improve the tqd greatly for all the bipartite states considered .",
    "moreover , we also showed that for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with homogeneous exchange interactions , an magnetic impurity along the @xmath45-direction of one spin can even be used to make tqd between the other two spins approaching its maximal value 1 , which is reminiscent of the nonlocal feature of quantum theory .",
