    "the q - model was introduced by coppersmith _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to describe the flow of stress in a static granular medium .",
    "although it does not provide a complete solution to the problem of stress flow in a granular medium , it provides a good first approximation .",
    "moreover , the q - model is closely related to models that describe the process of aggregation in statistical mechanics @xcite , the transport of electrons on the surface of an integer quantum hall multilayer @xcite , passive scalar turbulence @xcite , and the branching of river networks @xcite , among others . in earlier work by lewandowska _",
    "_ @xcite it was shown that although the q - model describes physics far from equilibrium , nonetheless , for a particular value of its parameters , the q - model behaves in a manner reminiscent of the critical point in an equilibrium thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "it was found that the q - model is remarkably soluble and a number of exact critical exponents and universal scaling functions near to the critical point were obtained .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to strengthen the analogy to thermodynamic critical phenomena by calculating the two point correlation functions for the q - model .    in experiments that the q - model is used to describe a pack of beads",
    "is loaded from above with a uniform stress .",
    "the distribution of load at the bottom of the bead pack as well as the propagation of stress through the pack have been measured experimentally @xcite . in the q - model",
    "it is assumed that the beads lie at the sites of a regular lattice .",
    "the beads in each layer are supported by their nearest neighbors in the layer below . for simplicity",
    "let us consider the q - model in two spatial dimensions .",
    "let us suppose that the beads are arranged in a square lattice as shown in the figure .",
    "for each bead a fraction @xmath2 of its load is supported by its neighbor to the left in the layer below and a fraction @xmath3 by its neighbor to the right .",
    "these fractions are assumed to vary randomly from bead to bead .",
    "we denote the depth of the layer by @xmath4 and the position of a bead within a layer by @xmath5 . the load on bead @xmath5 in layer @xmath6",
    "is then determined by the recursion relation @xmath7 given the random fractions @xmath2 one can use eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) to propagate an applied uniform load in the top layer downwards .",
    "the goal is to obtain a statistical description of the load as a function of depth by analytic or numerical solution of eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) .     of the load",
    "is transferred to the neighbor at left ; the remainder , @xmath8 to the neighbor to the right .",
    "the fractions vary from bead to bead and are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables .",
    "@xmath4 specifies the horizontal layer occupied by a bead .",
    "the horizontal layers are numbered by consecutive integers .",
    "the position of a bead within a horizontal layer is given by @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 is even in a layer with even @xmath4 ; odd , for odd @xmath4 .",
    "thus the horizontal separation of two beads in the same layer must be an even integer .",
    "similarly the horizontal separation for two beads in layers with an even vertical separation must also be an even integer.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the q - model it is generally assumed that the fractions are independent identically distributed random variables with a distribution @xmath9 that satisfies the symmetry requirement @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest choice is to assume that each fraction is either zero or one with equal probability ; this is called the singular distribution and it was shown in ref @xcite that the behavior of the q - model for this distribution is reminiscent of a critical point in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "other distributions can be characterized by a parameter @xmath11 ( defined precisely below ) that measures how far the distribution is from the critical point .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the horizontal and vertical two point correlations of the load on the beads by generalizing the methods of ref @xcite .",
    "the horizontal load correlation @xmath12 is the covariance of the load on two beads that are in the same layer at depth @xmath4 and have a horizontal separation @xmath13 .",
    "the brackets @xmath14 denote an average over the random fractions . by translational invariance",
    "the co - variance depends only on the separation of the two beads ( @xmath15 ) and not on the absolute location of either bead ( @xmath5 and @xmath16 respectively ) . by analogy",
    "to thermodynamic critical phenomena we would expect the horizontal correlation length to diverge as @xmath17 and the vertical correlation length to diverge as @xmath18 close to the critical point .",
    "furthermore we would expect the horizontal correlation function to have the universal scaling form @xmath19 we find that in two dimensions the correlation function does indeed have a universal scaling form for large depth @xmath4 and small @xmath11 that we determine .",
    "moreover we find the correlation length exponent @xmath20 , the dynamical exponent @xmath21 and the amplitude exponent @xmath22 .",
    "the vertical two point correlation @xmath23 is the covariance of the load on two beads that are located in horizontal layers separated by a depth of @xmath24 and that have a horizontal separation of @xmath15 .",
    "since the q - model is only translationally invariant in the horizontal direction the vertical two point correlation depends on both the separation of the two layers ( @xmath24 ) as well as the absolute location of the first layer ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "again by analogy to thermodynamic critical phenomena we would expect the vertical correlation to have the universal scaling form @xmath25 we find that in two dimensions the correlation function does indeed have a universal scaling form for large depth @xmath4 and small @xmath11 that we determine .",
    "moreover we find the correlation length exponent @xmath26 and the dynamical exponent @xmath27 in agreement with the values obtained from the horizontal correlation calculation and the amplitude exponent @xmath28 .",
    "the relationship of the q - model to random walk models can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose that instead of a uniform load , a unit load is applied to a small number of beads in the top layer .",
    "in the singular case the subsequent propagation of the load follows the trajectories of random walkers that coalesce upon contact and move together thereafter .",
    "the non - singular case can be interpreted as walkers that have a certain probability to fission .",
    "by contrast in common random walk models the walkers either pass through each other in the non - interacting case or bounce off each other or annihilate each other upon contact in interacting models @xcite .",
    "it will be seen below that the horizontal correlation functions of the q - model decay as gaussians rather than exponentials reflecting their close kinship to random walks .    in the prior work of lewandowska _",
    "_ @xcite the critical point was characterized by computing the covariance of the load on a single bead .",
    "ref @xcite derived the universal scaling function that describes the evolution of this quantity and computed a number of critical exponents including the product @xmath29 ( but not the separate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the present work adds to this body of knowledge the universal scaling forms for the two point correlations and the important critical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the present work is limited to two dimensions where the critical behavior is most interesting .",
    "ref @xcite also studied higher dimensions and thereby discovered that the upper critical dimension for the q - model is three .",
    "moreover ref @xcite considered the effect of an `` injection term '' that takes into account the weight of the beads which has been neglected in comparison to the applied load in eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) .",
    "in other related work rajesh and majumdar @xcite computed the two point correlations for the q - model but at large depth and far from the critical regime .",
    "finally snoeijer and van leeuwen refs @xcite have studied the distribution of load at asymptotically large depths , as discussed further in the conclusion .",
    "our purpose in this subsection is to evaluate the evolution of the correlations eq ( [ eq : horizontaldefn ] ) with depth by use of eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) .",
    "we begin by noting that the random fractions that appear in eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables with a symmetric distribution @xmath9 that satisfies the requirement @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of fractions may be characterized by a parameter @xmath30 defined via @xmath31 it is easy to verify that @xmath32 for the singular distribution and @xmath33 for the uniform distribution .",
    "thus @xmath11 defined as @xmath34 is a measure of the distance of a distribution from the singular distribution .",
    "we assume that a uniform load is applied to the top layer .",
    "hence the correlation in the top layer @xmath35 . as shown in section ii a of ref @xcite ,",
    "the subsequent evolution of the correlation is governed by @xmath36 the evolution matrix @xmath37 may be interpreted as the hamiltonian of a quantum particle on a lattice with a non - hermitian barrier at the origin .",
    "it was shown in section ii b of ref @xcite that one can obtain an integral expression for the correlation at depth @xmath4 by making a bi - orthogonal expansion in the left and right eigenstates of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "an important subtlety in this procedure is that one has to verify that the eigenstates of @xmath37 are complete since there is in general no guarantee that a non - hermitian operator will have a complete set of eigenstates .",
    "making use of the bi - orthogonal expansion and the expressions for the left and right eigenvectors of @xmath37 derived in ref @xcite we obtain @xmath38 } { \\left [ ( 1 - 2 \\epsilon + 2 \\epsilon^2 )   + ( 1 - 2 \\epsilon ) \\cos k \\right ] } \\label{eq : horizontalexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq ( [ eq : horizontalexact ] ) is an exact expression for the horizontal correlation function and is the main result of this subsection .",
    "we note that eq ( [ eq : horizontalexact ] ) applies for all @xmath39 except @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath40 the horizontal correlation function @xmath41 coincides with the variance calculated by ref @xcite and the expression for @xmath41 is given by their eq ( 41 ) .      to obtain the scaling limit of the correlation function we now simplify eq ( [ eq : horizontalexact ] ) , assuming @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but without making any assumptions about the relative size of @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath39 .",
    "this form is justified for small @xmath44 and leads to negligible error for large @xmath44 since both the exact expression and the approximation are negligible for @xmath44 large compared to @xmath45 .",
    "for the same reason we may extend the range of integration in eq ( [ eq : horizontalexact ] ) to infinity with negligible error . finally since the integrand has negligible weight for large @xmath44 we may expand both numerator and denominator in the second line of eq ( [ eq : horizontalexact ] ) to leading order in @xmath44 and @xmath11 .",
    "eqs ( [ eq : horizontalscaling ] ) and ( [ eq : fdefnd ] ) result after making these approximations and a rescaling of the integration variable . ] .",
    "we find @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a scaled measure of depth and @xmath48 is a scaled measure of horizontal separation and the function @xmath49 it is evident from eqs ( [ eq : horizontalscaling ] ) and ( [ eq : fdefnd ] ) that the horizontal correlations have the expected scaling form eq ( [ eq : horizontalhypothesis ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from the form of the scaled variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 we infer that the horizontal correlation length exponents @xmath20 and the dynamical exponent @xmath21 .    to derive the asymptotic behavior of the correlation function in the scaling regime it is convenient to rewrite the correlation function as @xmath52 \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{1}{4 } s^2 \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : alternatehorizontal}\\ ] ] this form is obtained by noting that @xmath53 is an integral over a product of a gaussian and a lorentzian . using parseval s theorem it",
    "may therefore be written as an integral over a product of the fourier transforms of the gaussian and lorentzian factors . using this transformed representation for @xmath53 leads from eq ( [ eq : horizontalscaling ] ) to eq ( [ eq : alternatehorizontal ] ) .",
    "now let us consider the regime of small depth , @xmath54 or equivalently @xmath55 ( the `` critical regime '' ) . in this regime we would expect the correlation function to be indistinguishable from the correlation function at the critical point .",
    "indeed we find that for small @xmath50 eq ( [ eq : alternatehorizontal ] ) simplifies to @xmath56 thus the correlation function depends only on @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 and is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "eq ( [ eq : shallowhorizontal ] ) reveals that in the critical regime the loads ( or to be precise the deviations in load from the mean ) on neighboring beads are strongly _ anti - correlated_. for small distances ( @xmath58 ) eq ( [ eq : shallowhorizontal ] ) simplifies to @xmath59 at large distances ( @xmath60 ) eq ( [ eq : shallowhorizontal ] ) simplifies to @xmath61 in other words the anti - correlations decay as a gaussian . in summary we find that in the critical regime there are strong horizontal anti - correlations whose range grows with the square root of the depth .",
    "next let us consider the regime of large depth , @xmath62 or equivalently @xmath63 ( the `` saturated regime '' ) .",
    "in this regime eq ( [ eq : alternatehorizontal ] ) simplifies to @xmath64 thus in the saturated regime there are weak anti - correlations .",
    "the amplitude of these anti - correlations falls off inversely with depth whilst their range continues to grow as the square root of the depth .",
    "there is a remarkably simple exact relationship between the horizontal and vertical correlations for the q - model @xcite . in order to establish this relationship",
    "it is instructive to first consider the correlations between beads in two consecutive layers , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , with a horizontal separation @xmath65 . by use of the evolution",
    "eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) we may write @xmath66 note that the load on the beads in layer @xmath4 is independent of the fractions that appear on the right hand side of eq ( [ eq : onelayer ] ) ; these fractions determine the subsequent propagation of load from layer @xmath4 propagates to layer @xmath6 .",
    "hence the averages on the right hand side of eq ( [ eq : onelayer ] ) factorize . recalling that by virtue of the symmetry condition on the distribution of the fractions , @xmath67 , and making use of the definition of the horizontal correlation eq ( [ eq : horizontaldefn ] ) we obtain @xmath68 similarly one can relate the correlation between beads separated by two layers , @xmath69 , to horizontal correlations by twice using the evolution eq ( [ eq : weightrecursion ] ) to obtain @xmath70 by now the astute reader will have noted the appearance of binomial coefficients in eqs ( [ eq : onefactorized ] ) and ( [ eq : twofactorized ] ) and indeed it is not difficult to show by induction that @xmath71 eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) is the exact relationship between vertical and horizontal correlations and is the main result of this subsection .      in this section",
    "we derive the universal scaling behavior of the vertical correlation function .",
    "there are three circumstances to consider .",
    "it is clear from fig [ fig : qmodel ] that each bead sits at the bottom of an inverted cone of beads that are partially supported by it .",
    "the correlation between two beads will evidently be strong if the upper bead of the pair lies inside the support cone of the lower bead . under this circumstance , which we call the `` direct case '' , @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand if the two beads are so far apart that their support cones do not intersect at all the correlation between their loads is rigorously zero .",
    "the `` uncorrelated case '' corresponds to the condition @xmath73 .",
    "finally there is the intermediate `` indirect case '' in which the two support cones do intersect but the upper bead does not lie inside the support cone of the lower bead .",
    "we first consider the scaling limit for the direct case .",
    "the sum in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) can be separated into two parts .",
    "the first part corresponds to the single term with @xmath74 .",
    "this term determines the contribution of the covariance in load of the upper bead to the vertical correlation with the lower bead . it will emerge that this co - variance contribution leads to positive correlations and tends to dominate the direct vertical correlations .",
    "the second part corresponds to the remaining terms in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) .",
    "it will emerge that this contribution leads to anti - correlations and is generally subdominant .",
    "we now compute the co - variance contribution to the direct vertical correlation . retaining only the @xmath74 term in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath75 assuming that @xmath76 and @xmath77 we may approximate the binomial coefficient as a gaussian . finally using the scaling limit of @xmath78 given in eq ( 48 ) of ref @xcite we obtain @xmath79 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\int_0^\\infty d s \\exp ( - s \\sqrt{t \\delta^2 } )   e^ { - s^2/4 } \\right ] .",
    "% \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{1}{4 } s^2 \\right ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : directverticalscaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq ( [ eq : directverticalscaling ] ) gives the covariance contribution to the the direct vertical correlations in the scaling limit .",
    "it agrees with the conjectured universal scaling form in eq ( [ eq : verticalscaling ] ) and we find that the critical exponents are @xmath80 .    to gain further insight into the covariance contribution to the direct vertical correlations it is useful to consider the limiting behavior of eq ( [ eq : directverticalscaling ] ) in the critical regime ( @xmath55 ) and the saturated regime ( @xmath63 ) . in the former limit the dependence on @xmath11 cancels and",
    "we find @xmath81 \\label{eq : verticalshallowscaling}\\ ] ] thus in the critical regime there are strong vertical correlations ( not anti - correlations ) and these correlations grow with the square root of the depth @xmath4 .",
    "the horizontal range of the correlations grows as the square root of the vertical separation between the two beads , @xmath82 .",
    "if we imagine increasing the horizontal separation of the beads , keeping the vertical separation fixed , then the correlations die away well before we reach the boundary of the support cone . in the saturated regime",
    "we find @xmath83 here too there are strong vertical correlations ( not anti - correlations ) but these correlations have saturated and are no longer growing with depth @xmath4 .",
    "their horizontal range grows as the square root of the vertical separation between the beads , @xmath82 .",
    "the correlations die away well before we reach the boundary of the support cone , just as they do in the critical regime .",
    "we turn now to the second contribution to the vertical correlations in the direct case , namely the sum over terms with @xmath84 in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) . in the scaling regime",
    "we may approximate the binomial coefficients in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) as a gaussian , convert the sum into an integral and extend the range of integration to infinity to obtain @xmath85 using eq ( [ eq : alternatehorizontal ] ) for @xmath86 we may perform the integral over @xmath44 explicitly to obtain @xmath87 \\int_0^\\infty   d s \\ ; e^ { - s^2/4 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times &   \\exp \\left [ - s \\left (   \\sqrt { ( t + \\tau ) \\delta^2 }   - \\frac { m \\delta } { \\sqrt { ( t + \\tau ) \\delta^2 } }   \\right ) \\right ] . \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : indirectscaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this contribution to the vertical correlation function is also of the conjectured form eq ( [ eq : verticalscaling ] ) with the same critical exponents @xmath88 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is noteworthy that this contribution is a function only of the @xmath89 and the ratio @xmath90 ; it is a more restricted function of its arguments than required by the scaling form eq ( [ eq : verticalscaling ] ) .",
    "the full vertical correlation in the direct case is the sum of eq ( [ eq : directverticalscaling ] ) and eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) ; however , as noted above and shown below , the contribution of eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) is generally dominated by the contribution of eq ( [ eq : directverticalscaling ] ) .    to gain further insight into the second contribution to the direct vertical correlations it is useful to consider the limiting behavior of eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) in the critical regime ( @xmath55 ) and the saturated regime ( @xmath63 ) . in the former limit the dependence on @xmath11 cancels and",
    "we find @xmath91 eq ( [ eq : indirectscalingcritical ] ) is still a formidable expression but it simplifies to @xmath92 for @xmath93 and to @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "thus the second contribution to the direct vertical correlation in the critical regime corresponds to a weak anti - correlation that is negligible compared to the strong positive correlation implied by the first contribution , eq ( [ eq : verticalshallowscaling ] ) .",
    "next let us consider the saturated regime ( @xmath63 )",
    ". in this regime eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) simplifies to @xmath96 eq ( [ eq : indirectscalingsaturated ] ) should be compared to the first contribution eq ( [ eq : verticaldeepscaling ] ) .",
    "thus in the saturated regime too the second contribution to the direct vertical correlations is smaller than the first contribution .    in summary , in the direct case",
    "the vertical correlation is the sum of two contributions both of which have the conjectured universal scaling form , eq ( [ eq : verticalscaling ] ) , with exponents @xmath88 and @xmath21 .",
    "the first contribution eq ( [ eq : directverticalscaling ] ) corresponds to a positive correlation and generally dominates . the second contribution eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) corresponds to an anti - correlation and is generally subdominant .",
    "it is illuminating to look at the limiting behavior of the two components in the critical regime ( @xmath55 ) and the saturated regime . in the critical regime",
    "the first contribution is given by eq ( [ eq : verticalshallowscaling ] ) and the second contribution , which lies between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , is given by eq ( [ eq : indirectscalingcritical ] ) . in the saturated regime the first contribution is given by eq ( [ eq : verticaldeepscaling ] ) and the second contribution by eq ( [ eq : indirectscalingsaturated ] ) .",
    "finally , we now turn to the vertical correlation in the indirect case , @xmath99 . in this case",
    "the first contribution is absent since the term @xmath74 lies outside the range of the sum in eq ( [ eq : verticalexact ] ) .",
    "thus in the indirect case there is only a weak anti - correlation between beads given by eq ( [ eq : indirectscaling ] ) .",
    "this concludes our analysis of the vertical correlations .",
    "in this paper we add to the existing body of known results about the q - model by obtaining new results on the exact horizontal and vertical correlation functions .",
    "we show that the correlation functions have a universal scaling form close to the critical point identified in previous work @xcite and we determine the scaling form and associated critical exponents .",
    "it is intriguing that the q - model , which describes physics far from equilibrium , nonetheless shows behavior reminiscent of equilibrium thermodynamic critical phenomena . among the many questions that our work leaves open we here",
    "mention two .",
    "first we note that it may be possible to calculate three point and higher correlation functions by means of a non - hermitian generalization of bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "second , it is desirable to determine the dynamics of the entire distribution of load on a single bead .",
    "ref @xcite obtained the dynamics of the entire distribution right at the critical point and snoeijer and van leewen @xcite studied the large depth asymptotic dynamics of the load distribution in a case far from the the critical point .",
    "close to the critical point ref @xcite made a scaling hypothesis about the form of this distribution and it remains of interest to verify this conjecture via numerics or exact solution .",
