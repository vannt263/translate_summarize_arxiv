    "spectral methods are often the methods of choice when high - resolution solvers are sought for nonlinear time - dependent problems . here , we are concerned with the stability and convergence of fourier method for pdes with quadratic nonlinearities : we focus our attention on the prototypical cauchy problems for the inviscid burgers equation and the incompressible euler equations .",
    "the fourier methods for problems involving quadratic nonlinearities come in two main flavors : the _ spectral fourier method _ and the 2/3 smoothing of _ pseudo - spectral fourier method_. the spectral fourier method is realized in terms of @xmath4-degree fourier expansions , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the fourier moments of @xmath7 @xmath8 the computation of these moments in nonlinear problems is carried out by convolutions .",
    "these can be avoided when the @xmath9 s are replaced by the discrete fourier coefficients , sampled at the @xmath10 equally spaced grid points @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the discrete torus , @xmath13 the pseudo - spectral fourier method is realized in terms of the corresponding expansion , @xmath14 . here , we have the advantage that nonlinearities are computed as exact pointwise quantities at the grid points @xmath15 , but new aliasing errors are introduced . to avoid aliasing errors and their potential instabilities ,",
    "high mode smoothing is implemented , which results in the so - called @xmath0-smoothing of pseudo - spectral fourier method : it is realized in terms of the @xmath16-degree expansion , @xmath17 .",
    "this is the spectral method of choice in many time - dependent problems with quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "to put our discussion into perspective we begin , in section [ sec : lin ] , by recalling the linear setup of standard transport equation .",
    "the spectral fourier method is @xmath3-stable .",
    "but the pseudo - spectral fourier method is not @xcite : it is only _ weakly _ stable , due to amplification of aliasing errors when the underlying solution lacks sufficient smoothness .",
    "strong @xmath3-stability is regained with the @xmath0-smoothing of pseudo - spectral fourier method , @xcite ; in the linear setup , the de - aliasing in the @xmath0-method introduces sufficient smoothness to maintain convergence .",
    "this is one of the main two themes of our results on nonlinear problems : sufficient smoothness guarantees stability and hence spectral convergence . in section [ sec : burgers ] we explore this issue in the context of inviscid burgers equations , proving that as long as the solution of the inviscid burgers equation remains smooth , @xmath18 , then both the spectral and the @xmath0-pseudo - spectral fourier approximations , @xmath19 , converge to the exact solution .",
    "moreover , they enjoy _ spectral convergence rate _ , namely , the convergence rate grows with the increasing smoothness of @xmath20 , @xmath21    a similar statement of spectral convergence holds for the spectral and @xmath0 pseudo - spectral fourier approximations @xmath22 of the incompressible euler equations : in section [ sec : smootheuler ] we prove that as long as @xmath23 remains sufficiently smooth solution of the @xmath24-dimensional euler equations , @xmath25 , then @xmath26 these results support the superiority of spectral methods for problems with smooth solutions .",
    "when dealing with solutions which lack smoothness , however , both the spectral and @xmath0 pseudo - spectral fourier methods suffer nonlinear instabilities .",
    "this is the other main theme of the paper , explored in the context of the inviscid burgers equation and the incompressible euler equations in the respective sections [ sec:2 - 3rd ] and [ sec : nonsmootheuler ] . in particular",
    ", we prove that after shock formation , the spectral and @xmath0 pseudo - spectral bounded approximations of the inviscid burgers solution _ must _ produce spurious oscillations as their total variation must increase , @xmath27{n}$ ] .",
    "this is deduced by contradiction : in theorem [ thm : instab ] below we prove , using compensated compactness arguments , that an @xmath3-weak limit of slowly growing tv fourier solutions , @xmath28 , must be an @xmath3-energy _ conservative _ solution , which can not hold once shocks are formed.a similar scenario arises with the euler solutions where the spectral and the ( @xmath0 pseudo-)spectral approximations of euler equations enforce conservation of the @xmath3-energy .",
    "although there is no known energy dissipation - based selection principle to identify a unique solution of euler equations within the class of  rough \" data ( similar to the entropy dissipation selection principle for burgers equations ) , nevertheless we argue that the @xmath3-energy conservation of the ( pseudo-)spectral approximations may be responsible to their unstable behavior .",
    "while @xmath3-energy conservation holds for weak solutions with a minimal degree of @xmath1-order of smoothness ( onsager s conjecture proved in @xcite ) , there are experimental and numerical evidence for the other part of onsager s conjecture that anomalous dissipation of energy shows up for  physical - turbulent \" @xmath3-solutions of euler equations @xcite . whether this observed anomalous dissipation of energy should be due to spontaneous appearance of singularities in smooth solutions of the euler equation or to the fact that physical initial data may be rough is a completely open problem .",
    "however after several preliminary breakthrough @xcite and @xcite the following fact are now well established . indeed , there are infinitely many initial data ( which of course are not regular ) leading to infinitely many weak euler solutions with energy loss @xcite .",
    "in particular there are solutions which for almost every time belong to the critical regularity @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the numerical method captures such  rough \" solutions then the  unphysical \" conservation of energy which is enforced at the spectral level has to vanish at the limit , leading to spurious oscillations .",
    "we close this paper with two complementary results . the nonlinear instability results in sections [ sec:2 - 3rd ] and [ sec : nonsmootheuler ] emphasize the competition between spectral convergence for smooth solutions vs. nonlinear instabilities for problems which lack sufficient smoothness . in section [ sec : sv ] we discuss the class of _ spectral viscosity _",
    "( sv ) methods which entertain both  spectral convergence and nonlinear stability , @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by adding a judicious amount of spectral viscosity at the high - portion of the spectrum without sacrificing the spectral accuracy at the lower portion of the spectrum .",
    "finally , we note that the above stability and instability results are not necessarily restricted to quadratic nonlinearities : in section [ sec : isen ] we prove the stability of fourier method for smooth solutions of the nonlinear isentropic equations",

    "set @xmath39 as a discrete spacing .",
    "if we replace the integrals with quadrature based on sampling @xmath35 at the @xmath40equi - spaced points , @xmath41 , we obtain the _ pseudo - spectral _ fourier projection , @xmath42 here , @xmath43 , are the discrete fourier coefficients .",
    "the mapping @xmath44 is a projection : @xmath45 is the unique @xmath4-degree _ trigonometric interpolant _ of @xmath35 at the @xmath46-gridpoints , @xmath47 .",
    "the dual statement of the last equalities is the poisson summation formula , which determines the discrete @xmath43 s in terms of the exact fourier coefficients , @xmath30 s , @xmath48 where summation runs over all @xmath24-tuples , @xmath49 .",
    "it shows that all the fourier coefficients with wavenumber @xmath50 $ ] are  aliased \" into the same discrete fourier coefficient , @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that the interpolation error consists of two main contributions , @xmath52 where in addition to the truncation error @xmath53 in ( [ eq : tr ] ) , we now have the _ aliasing error _ , @xmath54(\\bx):=\\sum_{|\\bk|\\leq n}\\big(\\sum_{|\\bj|\\geq 1}\\widehat{w}(\\bk+\\bj(2n+1))\\big)e^{i\\bk\\iprod\\bx}.\\ ] ] both , @xmath53 and @xmath55 , involve high modes , @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , if the function @xmath57 is sufficiently smooth then they have exactly the same spectrally small size , e.g. @xcite @xmath58\\|_{h^s } \\lesssim \\|\\tw\\|_{h^s } \\lesssim n^{s - r}\\|w\\|_{h^r } , \\qquad r > s>\\dhf.\\ ] ] since the truncation error is orthogonal to the computational @xmath4-space whereas the aliasing error is not the situation is different if @xmath35 lacks smoothness",
    ". then aliasing and truncation errors may have a completely different influence on the question of computational stability .",
    "one such case is encountered with the stability question of spectral vs. pseudo - spectral approximations of hyperbolic equations .",
    "we want to solve the @xmath59-periodic scalar hyperbolic equation @xmath60,\\ ] ] subject to prescribed initial conditions , @xmath61 , by the spectral fourier method . to this end",
