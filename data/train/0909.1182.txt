    "the evidence for the existence of dark matter in various astrophysical systems has been gathering over the past three decades .",
    "it is now well - recognized that the presence of dark matter is required in order to explain the observations of galaxies and other astrophysical systems on larger scales .",
    "the clearest support for the existence of dark matter comes from the now well - known observation of nearly flat rotation curves or constant rotation velocity in the outer parts of galaxies @xcite .",
    "surprisingly the rotation velocity is observed to remain nearly constant till the last point at which it can be measured .",
    "the simple principle of rotational equilibrium then tells one that the amount of dark to visible mass must increase at larger radii .",
    "thus the existence of the dark matter is deduced from its dynamical effect on the visible matter , namely the stars and the interstellar gas in galaxies .",
    "the presence of dark matter in the elliptical galaxies is more problematic to ascertain since these do not contain much interstellar hydrogen gas which could be used as a tracer of their dynamics , and also because these galaxies are not rotationally supported .",
    "these galaxies are instead supported by pressure or random motion of stars ( see binney @xcite for details of physical properties of the spiral and elliptical galaxies ) . as a result",
    ", the total mass can not be deduced using the rotation curve for elliptical galaxies . instead , here the motions of planetary nebulae which arise from old ,",
    "evolved stars , as well as lensing , have been used to trace the dark matter @xcite .",
    "the fraction of dark matter at four effective radii is still uncertain with values ranging from 20% to 60% given in the literature , for the extensively studied elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 @xcite .",
    "historically the first evidence for the unseen or dark matter was found in _",
    "clusters _ of galaxies . assuming the cluster to be in a virial equilibrium",
    ", the total or the virial mass can be deduced from the observed kinematics .",
    "zwicky @xcite noted that there is a discrepancy of a factor of @xmath2 10 between the observed mass in clusters of galaxies and the virial mass deduced from the kinematics .",
    "in other words , the random motions are too large for the cluster to be bound and a substantial amount of dark matter ( @xmath2 10 times the visible matter in galaxies ) is needed for the clusters of galaxies to remain bound .",
    "this discrepancy remained a puzzle for over four decades , and was only realized to be a part of the general trend after the galactic - scale dark matter was discovered in the late 1970 s .",
    "on the much larger cosmological scale , there has been some evidence for non - baryonic dark matter from theoretical estimates of primordial elements during big bang nucleosynthesis and measurements of them , particularly , primordial deuterium .",
    "accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) could as well give information about the total dark matter relic density of the universe .",
    "the satellite based cobe experiment was one of the first experiments to provide accurate  mapping \" of the cmbr@xcite .",
    "the recent high precision determination of the cosmological parameters using type i supernova data @xcite as well as precise measurements of the cosmic background radiation by the wmap collaboration @xcite has pinpointed the total relic dark matter density in the early universe with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "accordingly , dark matter forms almost 26% of all the matter density of the universe , with visible matter about 4% and the dark energy roughly about 70% of the total energy density .",
    "this goes under the name of @xmath3cdm model with @xmath3 standing for dark energy and denoted by the einstein s constant , and cdm standing for cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations for the currently popular scenario of galaxy formation , based on the @xmath4cdm model , predicts a universal profile for the dark matter in halos of spherical galaxies @xcite . while this model was initially successful , over the years many discrepancies between the predictions from it and the observations have been pointed out .",
    "the strongest one has been the ` cusp - core ' issue of the central mass distribution . while navarro _",
    "_ @xcite predict a cuspy central mass distribution , the observations of rotation curves of central regions of galaxies , especially the low surface brightness galaxies , when modeled show a flat or cored density distribution @xcite .    a significantly different alternative to the dark matter , which can be used to explain the rotation curves of the galaxies and clusters was proposed early on by milgrom .",
    "he claimed that @xcite for low accelerations , newtonian law has to be modified by addition of a small repulsive term .",
    "this idea is known as mond or the modified newtonian dynamics . while initially this idea was not taken seriously by the majority of astrophysics community",
    ", it has gained more acceptance in the recent years .",
    "for example some of the standard features seen in galaxies such as the frequency of bars can be better explained under the mond paradigm , see tiret _",
    "_ @xcite . for a summary of the predictions and comparisons of these two alternatives ( dark matter and mond ) , see combes _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "so far the most direct empirical proof for the existence of dark matter , and hence the evidence against mond , comes from the study of the so - called bullet cluster@xcite .",
    "this is a pair of galaxies undergoing a supersonic collision at a redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "the main visible baryonic component in clusters is hot , x - ray emitting gas . in a supersonic collision ,",
    "this hot gas would collide and be left at the center of mass of the colliding system while the stars will just pass through since they occupy a small volume .    in the bullet cluster , the gravitational potential as traced by the weak - lensing shows peaks that are separated from the central region traced by the hot gas . in mond ,",
    "these two would be expected to coincide , since the gravitational potential would trace the dominant visible component namely the hot gas , while if there is dark matter it would be expected to peak at the location of the stellar component in the galaxies .",
    "the latter case is what has been observed as can been seen in fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the article , we will not consider the mond explanation , but instead take the view point that the flat rotation curves of galaxies and clusters at large radii as an evidence for the existence of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the dark matter explanation is much simpler and more natural compared to the mond explanation .",
    "despite the fact that the existence of dark matter has been postulated for over three decades , there is still no consensus of what its constituents are .",
    "this has been summarized well in many review articles .",
    "refs @xcite are couple of examples that span from the early to recent times on this topic . over the years",
    ", both astrophysicists as well as particle physicists have speculated on the nature of dark matter .    the baryonic dark matter in the form of low - mass stars , binary stars , or jupiter - like massive planets",
    "were ruled out early on ( see @xcite for a summary ) . from the amount of dark matter required to explain the flat rotation curves",
    ", it can be shown that the number densities required of these possible constituents would be large , and hence it would be hard to hide these massive objects . because , if present in these forms , they should have been detected either from their absorption or from their emission signals .",
    "it has also been proposed that the galactic dark matter could be in the form of dense , cold molecular clumps @xcite , though this has not yet been detected .",
    "this alternative can not be expected to explain the dark matter necessary to  fit \" the observations of clusters , or indeed the elliptical galaxies since the latter have very little interstellar gas .",
    "there is also a more interesting possibility of the dark matter being essentially of baryonic nature , but due to the dynamics of the qcd phase transition in the early universe which left behind a form of _ cold _ quark - gluon - plasma , the baryon number content of the dark matter is hidden from us .",
    "this idea was first proposed by witten in 1984 @xcite , who called these quantities as quark nuggets .",
    "an upper limit on the total number of baryons in a quark nugget is determined by the baryon to photon ratio in the early universe ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "taking in to consideration these constraints , it is possible to fit the observed relic density with a mass ( density ) distribution of the quark nuggets @xcite . for the observational possibilities of such quark nuggets ,",
    "see for example , ref.@xcite .    from a more fundamental point of view , it is not clear what kind of elementary particle could form dark matter .",
    "the standard model of particle physics describes all matter to be made up of quarks and leptons of which neutrinos are the _ only _ ones which can play the role of dark matter as they are electrically neutral .",
    "however with the present indications from various neutrino oscillation experiments putting the standard model neutrino masses in the range @xmath6 ev @xcite they will not form significant amount of dark matter . there could however , be non - standard sterile neutrinos with masses of the order of kev - mev which could form _ _",
    "warm__dark matter ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) , on the other hand , is favored over the _",
    "warm _ dark matter by the hierarchical clustering observed in numerical simulations for large scale structure formation , see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "recent analysis including x - ray flux observations from coma cluster and andromeda galaxy have shown that the room for sterile neutrino warm dark matter is highly constrained @xcite . however",
    ", if one does not insist that the total relic dark matter density is due to sterile neutrinos then , it is still possible that they form a sub - dominant _ warm _ component of the total dark matter @xcite relic density .",
    "the standard model thus , needs to be extended to incorporate a dark matter candidate .",
    "the simplest extensions would be to just include a new particle which is a singlet under the sm gauge group ( _ i.e. _ , does not carry the standard model interactions ) .",
    "further , we might have to impose an additional symmetry under which the dark matter particle transforms non - trivially to keep it stable or at least sufficiently long lived with a life time typically larger than the age of the universe .",
    "some of the simplest models would just involve adding additional light ( @xmath2 gev ) scalar particles to the sm and with an additional @xmath7 symmetry ( see for example , boehm _ et al . _",
    "similar extensions of sm can be constructed with fermions too @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of these set of models is that they can be tested at existing @xmath8 colliders like for the example , the one at present at frascati , italy @xcite .",
    "a heavier set of dark matter candidates can be achived by extending the higgs sector by adding additional higgs scalar doublets .",
    "these go by the name of _ inert _ higgs models @xcite . in this extension , there is a _ additional _",
    "neutral higgs boson which does not have sm gauge interactions ( hence inert ) , which can be a dark matter candidate . with the inclusion of this extra inert higgs doublet ,",
    "the sm particle spectrum has some added features , like it can evade the up to 1.5 tev while preserving the perturbativity of higgs couplings up to high scales and further it is consistent with the electroweak precision tests @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there exist extensions of the standard model ( generally labeled beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics ) which have been constructed to address a completely different problem called the hierarchy problem .",
    "the hierarchy problem addresses the lack the symmetry for the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model and the consequences of this in the light of the large difference of energy scales between the weak interaction scale ( @xmath9 gev ) and the quantum gravity or grand unification scale ( @xmath10 gev ) .",
    "such a huge difference in the energy scales could destabilize the higgs mass due to quantum corrections . to protect the higgs mass from these dangerous radiative corrections , new theories such as supersymmetry",
    ", large extra dimensions and little higgs have been proposed .",
    "it turns out that most of these bsm physics models contain a particle which can be the dark matter .",
    "a few examples of these theories and the corresponding candidates for dark matter are as follows .",
    "( i ) axions are pseudo - scalar particles which appear in theories with peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite proposed as solution to the _ strong cp _ problem of the standard model .",
    "they also appear in superstring theories which are theories of quantum gravity .",
    "the present limits on axions are @xcite extremely strong from astrophysical data . in spite of this",
    ", there is still room for axions to form a significant part of the dark matter relic density .",
    "\\(ii ) supersymmetric theories @xcite which incorporate fermion - boson interchange symmetry are proposed as extensions of standard model to protect the higgs mass from large radiative corrections .",
    "the dark matter candidate is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which is stable or sufficiently long lived as mentioned before - parity .",
    "if this symmetry is exact , the particle is stable .",
    "if is broken very mildly , the lsp could be sufficiently long lived , close to the age of the universe . ] .",
    "depending on how supersymmetry is broken @xcite , there are several possible dark matter candidates in these models . in some models ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle and hence the dark matter candidate is a neutralino .",
    "the neutralino is a linear combination of super - partners of @xmath11 as well as the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the other possible candidates are the super - partner of the graviton , called the gravitino and the super - partners of the axinos , the scalar saxion and the fermionic axino .",
    "these particles also can explain the observed relic density @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) other classic extensions of the standard model either based on additional space dimensions or larger symmetries also have dark matter candidates .",
    "in both versions of the extra dimensional models , _",
    "i.e. , _ the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , dvali ( add ) @xcite and randall - sundrum ( rs ) @xcite , models , the lightest kaluza - klein particle can be considered as the dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the little - higgs models where the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a much larger symmetry , a symmetry called t - parity @xcite assures us a stable and neutral particle which can form the dark matter .",
    "very heavy neutrinos with masses of @xmath12 can also naturally appear within some classes of randall - sundrum and little higgs models .",
    "under suitable conditions , these neutrinos can act like cold dark matter .",
    "( for a recent study , please see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these particles , more exotic candidates like simpzillas @xcite and wimpzillas @xcite with masses close to the gut scale ( @xmath13 gev ) have also been proposed in the literature .",
    "indirect searches like icecube @xcite ( discussed below ) already have strong constraints on simpzillas .",
    "if the dark matter candidate is indeed a new particle and it has interactions other than gravitational interactions , then the most probable interactions it could have are the weak interactions .",
    "this weakly interacting particle , dubbed as wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) could interact with ordinary matter and leave traces of its nature .",
    "there are two ways in which the wimp could be detected ( a ) direct detection : here one looks for the interaction of the wimp on a target , the target being typically nuclei in a scintillator .",
    "it is expected that the wimps present all over the galaxy scatter off the target nuclei once in a while .",
    "measuring the recoil of the nuclei in these rarely occurring events would give us information about the properties of the wimp . the scattering cross section",
    "would depend on whether it was elastic or inelastic and is a function of the spin of the wimp .",
    "there are more than 20 experiments located all over the world , which are currently looking for wimp through this technique .",
    "some of them are dama , cdms , cresst , cuoricino , drift _ etc . _",
    "( b ) indirect detection : when wimps cluster together in the galatic halo , they can annihilate with themselves giving rise to electron - positron pairs , gamma rays , proton - anti - proton pairs , neutrinos _ etc . _",
    "the flux of such radiation is directly proportional to the annihilation rate and the the wimp matter density .",
    "observation of this radiation could lead to information about the mass and the cross section strength of the wimps .",
    "currently , there are several experiments which are looking for this radiation ( i ) magic , hess , cangaroo , fermi / glast , egret _ etc .",
    "_ look for the gamma ray photons .",
    "( ii ) heat , caprice , bess , pamela , ams can observe anti - protons and positron flux .",
    "( iii)very highly energetic neutrinos / cosmic rays @xmath14 a few tev to multi - tev can be observed by large detectors like amanda , antares , icecube _ etc . _ ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) .    over the years",
    ", there have been indications of presence of the dark matter through both direct and indirect experiments .",
    "the most popular of these signals are integral and dama results ( for a nice discussion on these topics please see , @xcite ) .",
    "integral ( international gamma -ray astrophysics laboratory ) is a satellite based experiment looking for gamma rays in outer space . in 2003 , it has observed a very bright emission of the 511 kev photons from the galactic bulge @xcite at the centre .",
    "the 511 kev line is special as it is dominated by @xmath8 annihilations via the positronium",
    ". the observed rate of ( 3 - 15 ) @xmath15 positrons / sec in the inner galaxy was much larger than the expected rate from pair creation via cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium in the galactic bulge by orders of magnitude .",
    "further , the signal is approximately spherically symmetric with very little positrons from galactic bulge contributing to the signal @xcite .",
    "several explanations have been put forward to explain this excess .",
    "astrophysical entities like hypernovae , gamma ray burts and x - ray binaries have been proposed as the likely objects contributing to this excess . on the other hand , this signal can also be attributed to the presence of dark matter which could annihilate itself giving rise to electron - positron pairs . to explain the integral signal in terms of dark matter , extensions of standard model involving light @xmath16 particles and light gauge bosons ( @xmath17 ) are ideally suited .",
    "these models which have been already reviewed in the previous section , can be probed directly at the existing and future @xmath8 colliders and hence could be tested . until further confirmation from either future astrophysical experiments or through ground based colliders comes about , the integral remains an ` anomaly ' as of now .",
    "while the integral is an indirect detection experiment , the dama ( dark matter ) is a direct detection experiment located in the gran sasso mountains of italy .",
    "the target material consists of highly radio pure nai crystal scintillators ; the scintillating light from wimp - nucleon scattering and recoil is measured .",
    "the experiment looks for an annual modulation of the signal as the earth revolves around the sun @xcite .",
    "such modulation of the signal is due to the gravitational effects of the sun as well as rotatory motion of the earth .",
    "dama and its upgraded version",
    "dama / libra have collected data for seven annual cycles and four annual cycles respectively @xcite . ] .",
    "together they have reported an annual modulation at 8.2@xmath18 confidence level .",
    "if confirmed , the dama results would be the first direct experimental evidence for the existence of wimp dark matter particle .",
    "however , the dama results became controversial as this positive signal has not been confirmed by other experiments like xenon and cdms , which have all reported null results in the spin independent wimp - nucleon scattering signal region .",
    "the xenon 10 detector also at gran sasso laboratories uses a xenon target while measuring simultaneously the scintillation and ionization produced by the scattering of the dark matter particle .",
    "the simultaneous measurement reduces the background significantly down to @xmath19 . with a fiducial mass of 5.4 kg",
    ", they set an upper limit of wimp - nucleon spin independent cross section to be 8.8 @xmath20 for a wimp mass of 100 gev@xcite .",
    "an upgraded version xenon 100 has roughly double the fiducial mass has started taking data from oct 2009 . in the first results , they present null results , with upper limits of about @xmath21 for 55 gev wimps @xcite .",
    "these results severely constraint interpretation of the dama results in terms of an elastic spin independent wimp - nucleon scattering .",
    "the cdms ( cryogenic dark matter search ) experiment has 19 germanium detectors located in the underground soudan mine , usa .",
    "it is maintained at temperatures @xmath22 ( milli - kelvin ) .",
    "nuclear recoils can be  seen \" by measuring the ionisation energy in the detector .",
    "efficient separation between electron recoils and nuclear recoils is possible by employing various techniques like signal timing and measuring the ratios of the ionization energies . similar to xenon , this experiment @xcite too reported null results in the signal region and puts an upper limit @xmath23 on the wimp - nucleon cross - section for a wimp mass of around 60 gev .",
    "the cogent ( cryogenic germanium neutrino technology ) collaboration runs another recent experiment which uses ultra low noise germanium detectors .",
    "it is also located in the soudan man , usa .",
    "the experiment has one of the lowest backgrounds below 3 kevee ( kev electron equivalent ( ee ) ionisation energy ) .",
    "it could further go down to 0.4 kevee , the electron noise threshold .",
    "the first initial runs have again reported null results @xcite consistent with the observed background . at this point , the experiment did not have the sensitivity to confirm / rule out the dama results .",
    "however , later runs have shown some excess events over the expected background in the low energy regions @xcite .",
    "while , the collaboration could not find a suitable explanation for this excess ( as of now ) there is a possibility of these _ excess _ events having their origins in a very light wimp dark matter particle .",
    "however , care should be taken before proceeding with this interpretation as the cogent collaboration does not distinguish between electron recoils and nucleon recoils@xcite .    in the light of these experimental results ,",
    "the dama results are hard to explain .",
    "one of the ways out to make the dama results consistent with other experiments is to include an effect called  channelling \" which could be present only in the nai crystals which dama uses .",
    "however , even the inclusion of this effect does not improve the situation significantly . to summarize , the situation is as follows for various interpretations of the wimp - nucleon cross section . for esi ( elastic spin independent ) interpretation ,",
    "the dama regions are excluded by both cdms as well as xenon 10 .",
    "this is irrespective of whether one considers the channeling effect or not .",
    "it is also hard to reconcile dama results with cogent in this case . for elastic spin",
    "dependent ( esd ) interpretation , the dama and cogent results though consistent with each other are in conflict with other experiments . for an interpretation in terms of wimp - proton scattering , the results are in conflict with several experiments like simple , picasso etc . on the other hand ,",
    "an interpretation in terms of wimp - neutron scattering is ruled out by xenon and cdms data .",
    "for the inelastic dark matter interpretations , spin -independent cross section with a medium mass ( @xmath24 ) wimp is disfavored by cresst as well as cdms data . for a low mass ( close to 10 gev )",
    "wimp , with the help of channeling in the nai crystals , it is possible to explain the dama results , in terms of spin- independent inelastic dark matter - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , the relevant parameters ( dark matter mass and mass splittings ) should be fine tuned and further , the wimp velocity distribution in the galaxy should be close to the escape velocity .",
    "inelastic spin dependent interpretation of the dama results is a possibility ( because it can change relative signals at different experiments @xcite ) which does not have significant constraints from other experiments .",
    "however , it has been shown@xcite that inelastic dark matter either with spin dependent or spin independent interpretation of the dama results is difficult to reconcile with the cogent results , unless one introduces substantial exponential background in the cogent data .",
    "the focus of the present topical review is a set of new experimental results which have appeared over the past year . in terms of the discussion in the previous section ,",
    "these experiments follow  indirect \" methods to detect dark matter .",
    "the data from these experiments seems to be pointing to either  discovery \" of the dark matter or some yet non - understood new astrophysics being operative within the vicinity of our galaxy .",
    "the four main experiments which have led to this excitement are ( i ) pamela@xcite ( ii ) atic@xcite ( iii ) hess@xcite and ( iv ) fermi@xcite .",
    "all of these experiments involve international collaborations spanning several nations .",
    "while pamela and fermi are satellite based experiments , atic is a balloon borne experiment and hess is a ground based telescope .",
    "all these experiments contain significant improvements in technology over previous generation experiments of similar type .",
    "the h.e.s.s experiment has a factor @xmath25 improvement in @xmath26-ray flux sensitivity over previous experiments largely due to its superior rejection of the hadronic background .",
    "similarly , atic is the next generation balloon based experiment equipped to have higher resolution as well as larger statistics .",
    "similar statements also hold for the satellite based experiments , pamela and fermi .",
    "it should be noted that the satellite based experiments have some inherent advantages over the balloon based ones .",
    "firstly , they have enhanced data taking period , unlike the balloon based ones which can take data only for small periods . and",
    "furthermore , these experiments also do not have problems with the residual atmosphere on the top of the instrument which plagues the balloon based experiments .    .",

    "[ pamela ] ) .",
    "the only other experimental data in this energy regime ( up to 40 gev ) are the ams and heat , which while having large errors are consistent with the excess seen by pamela . in the low energy regime",

    "i.e. _ as result of interactions of primary cosmic rays ( mainly protons and electrons ) with interstellar medium . the flux of this secondary sources can be estimated by numerical simulations .",
    "there are several numerical codes available to compute the secondary flux , the most popular publicly available codes being galprop @xcite and crpropa @xcite .",
    "these codes compute the effects of interactions and energy loses during cosmic ray propagation within galactic medium taking also in to account the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "galprop solves the differential equations of motion either using a 2d grid or a 3d grid while crpropa does the same using a 1d or 3d grids . while galprop contains a detailed exponential model of the galactic magnetic fields , crpropa implements only extragalactic turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "in particular crpropa is not optimised for convoluted galactic magnetic fields . for this reason ,",
    "galprop is best suited for solving diffusion equations involving low energy ( gev - tev ) cosmic rays in galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the main input parameters of the galprop code are the primary cosmic ray injection spectra , the spatial distribution of cosmic ray sources , the size of the propagation region , the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients and their dependencies on particle rigidity .",
    "these inputs are mostly fixed by observations , like the interstellar gas distribution is based on observations of neutral atomic and molecular gas , ionized gas ; cross sections and energy fitting functions are build from nuclear data sheets ( based on las almos nuclear compilation of nuclear crosssections and modern nuclear codes ) and other phenomenological estimates .",
    "interstellar radiation fields and galactic magnetic fields are based on various models present in literature .",
    "the uncertainties in these inputs would constitute the main uncertainties in the flux computation from galprop .",

    "[ pamela ] , the expectations based on galprop are given as a solid line running across the figure . from the figure it is obvious that pamela results show that the positron fraction increases with energy compared to what galprop expects .",
    "the excess in the positron fraction as measured by pamela with respect to galprop indicates that this could be a result due to new primary sources rather than secondary sources this new primary source could be either dark matter decay / annihilation or a nearby astrophysical object like a pulsar . before going to the details of the interpretations ,",

    "atic measures all the components of the cosmic rays such as electrons , protons ( and their anti - particles ) with high energy resolution , while distinguishing well between electrons and protons .",
    "atic ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ pamela ] ) presented its primary cosmic ray electron ( @xmath1 + ps . ) spectrum between the energies 3 gev to about 2.5 tev @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is normalized by a factor @xmath31 . ] .",
    "the results show that the spectrum while agreeing with the galprop expectations up to 100 gev , show a sharp increase above 100 gev .",
    "the total flux increases till about 600 gev where it peaks and then sharply falls till about 800 gev .",
    "thus , atic sees an excess of the primary cosmic ray ( @xmath1 + ps . ) spectrum between the energy range @xmath32 gev .",
    "the rest of the spectrum is consistent with the expectations within the errors .",
    "what is interesting about such peaks in the spectrum is that , if they are confirmed they could point towards a breit - wigner resonance in dark matter annihilation cross section with a life time as given by its width . as we will discuss in the next section , this possibility is severely constrained by the data from the fermi experiment .",
    "another ground based experiment sensitive to cosmic rays within this energy range is h.e.s.s which can measure gamma rays from few hundred gev to few tev .",
    "this large reflecting array telescope operating from namibia has presented data ( shown in figure [ fermi ] ) from @xmath33 gev to about 5 tev .",
    "it could confirm neither the peaking like behavior at 600 gev nor the sharp cut - off at 800 gev of the atic data .",
    "the atic results can be made consistent with those of hess .",
    "this would require a @xmath34 overall normalisation of the hess data .",
    "such a normalisation is well within the uncertainty of the energy resolution of hess .",
    "however notice that hess data does not have a sharp fall about and after 800 gev .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) is one of the main components of the fermi gamma ray space telescope , which was launched in june 2008 . due to its high resolution and high statistical capabilities ,",
    "it has been one of the most anticipated experiments in the recent times .",
    "fermi can measure gamma rays between 20 mev and 300 gev with high accuracy and primary cosmic ray electron ( @xmath1 + ps . )",
    "flux between 20 gev and 1 tev .",
    "the energy resolution averaged over the lat acceptance is 11% fwhm ( full - width - at - half - maximum ) for 20 - 100 gev , increasing to 13% fwhm for 150 - 200 gev . the photon angular resolution is less than 0.1  over the energy range of interest ( 68% containment ) .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration has recently published its six month data on the primary cosmic ray electron flux . more than 4 million electron events above 20 gev were selected in survey ( sky scanning ) mode from 4 august 2008 to 31 january 2009 .",
    "the systematic error on the absolute energy of the lat was determined to be @xmath35 for 20 - 300 gev .",
    "please see table i for more details on the errors in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fermi ] we reproduce the result produced by the fermi collaboration .",
    "they find that the primary cosmic ray electron spectrum more or less goes along the expected lines up to 100 gev ( its slightly below the expected flux between 10 and 50 gev ) , however above 100 gev , there is strong signal for an excess of the flux ranging up to 1 tev .",
    "the fermi data thus confirms the excess in the electron spectrum which was seen by atic , the excess however has a much flatter profile with respect to the peak seen by atic .",
    "thus , atic could in principle signify a resonance in the spectrum , whereas fermi can not .",
    "however , in comparing both the spectra from the figures presented above , one should keep in mind that the fermi excess is in the total electron spectrum ( @xmath36 ) whereas the atic data is presented in terms of positron excess only .",
    "if the excess in fermi is caused by the excess only through excess positrons , one should expect that the fermi spectra to also have similar peak like behavior at 600 gev . from fig.([fermi ] ) , where both fermi and atic data are presented , we see that the atic data points are far above that of fermi s .",
    "lets now summarise the experimental observations @xcite which would require an interpretation :    * the excess in the flux of positron fraction @xmath37 measured by pamela up to 100 gev . *",
    "the lack of excess in the anti - proton fraction measured by pamela up to 100 gev . * the excess in the total flux @xmath38 in the spectrum above 100 gev seen by fermi , hess _ etc .",
    "_ while below 100 gev , the measurements have been consistent with galprop expectations . * the absence of peaking like behavior as seen by atic , which indicates a long lived particle , in the total electron spectrum measured by fermi .",
    "two main interpretations have been put forward : ( a ) a nearby astrophysical source which has a mechanism to accelerate particles to high energies and ( b ) a dark matter particle which decays or annihilates leading to excess of electron and positron flux . which of the interpretations is valid will be known within the coming years with enhanced data from both pamela and fermi .",
    "let us now turn to both the interpretations :    pulsars and supernova shocks have been proposed as likely astrophysical local sources of energetic particles that could explain the observed excess of the positron fraction @xcite . in the high magnetic fields present in the pulsar magnetosphere , electrons can be accelerated and induce an electromagnetic cascade through the emission of curvature radiation .",
    "this can lead to a production of high energy photons above the threshold for pair production ; and on combining with the number density of pulsars in the galaxy , the resulting emission can explain the observed positron excess @xcite .",
    "the energy of the positrons tell us about the site of their origin and their propagation history @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray positrons above 1 tev could be primary and arise due to a source like a young plusar within a distance of 100 pc @xcite .",
    "this would also naturally explain the observed anisotropy , as argued for two of the nearest pulsars , namely @xmath39 and the @xmath40 @xcite . on a similar note ,",
    "diffusive shocks as in a supernova remnant hardens the spectrum , hence this process can explain the observed positron excess above 10 gev as seen from pamela @xcite .",
    "another possible astrophysical source that has been proposed is the pion production during acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays in the local sources @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the measurement of secondary nuclei produced by cosmic ray spallation can confirm whether this process or pulsars are more important as the production mechanism .",
    "it has been show that the present data from atic - ii supports the hadronic model and can account for the entire positron excess observed .",
    "if the excess observed by pamela , hess and fermi is not due to some yet not fully - understood astrophysics but is a signature of the dark matter , then there are two main processes through which such an excess can occur :    1 .   the annihilation of dark matter particles into standard model ( sm ) particles and 2 .   the decay of the dark matter particle into sm particles .",
    "interpretation in terms of annihilating dark matter , however , leads to conflicts with cosmology .",
    "the observed excesses in the pamela / fermi data would set a limit on the product of annihilation cross section and the velocity of the dark matter particle in the galaxy ( for a known dark matter density profile ) .",
    "annihilation of the dark matter particles also happens in the early universe with the same cross section but at much larger velocities for particles ( about 1000 times the particle velocities in galaxies ) .",
    "the resultant relic density is not compatible with observations .",
    "the factor @xmath41 difference in the velocities should some how be compensated in the cross sections .",
    "this can be compensated by considering",
    " boost \" factors for the particles in the galaxy which can enhance the cross section by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the boost factors essentially emanate from assuming local substructures for the dark matter particles , like clumps of dark matter and are typically free parameters of the model ( see however , @xcite ) .",
    "another mechanism which goes by the name sommerfeld mechanism can also enhance the annihilation cross sections .",
    "for very heavy dark matter ( with masses much greater than the relevant gauge boson masses ) trapped in the galactic potential , non - perturbative effects could push the annihilation cross - sections to much larger values . for su(2 ) charged dark matter , the masses of dark matter particles should be @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld mechanism is more general and applicable to other ( new ) interactions also@xcite .",
    "another way of avoiding conflict with cosmology would be to consider non - thermal production of dark matter in the early universe . before the release of fermi data , the annihilating dark matter model with a very heavy dark matter @xmath43tev was much in favour to explain the  resonance peak \" of the atic and the excess in pamela data .",
    "post fermi , whose data does not have sharp raise and fall associated with a resonance , the annihilating dark matter interpretation has been rendered incompatible .",
    "however , considering possible variations in the local astro physical background profile due to presence of local cosmic ray accelerator , it has been shown that it is still possible to explain the observed excess , along with fermi data with annihilating dark matter .",
    "the typical mass of the dark matter particle could lie even within sub - tev region @xcite and as low as @xmath44 gev @xcite .",
    "some more detailed analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "several existing bsm physics models of annihilating dark matter become highly constrained or ruled out if one requires to explain pamela / atic and fermi data .",
    "the popular supersymmetric dm candidate neutralino with its annihilating partners such as chargino , stop , stau _ etc .",
    "_ , can explain the cosmological relic density but not the excess observed by pamela / atic .",
    "novel models involving a new _ dark force _ , with a gauge boson having mass of about 1 gev @xcite , which predominantly decays to _ leptons _ , together with the so - called sommerfeld enhancement seem to fit the data well . the above class of models , which are extensions of standard model with an additional @xmath7 gauge group , caught the imagination of the theorists @xcite . a similar supersymmetric version of this mechanism where the neutralinos in the mssm can annihilate to a scalar particle , which can then decay the observed excess in the cosmic ray data @xcite .",
    "models involving type ii seesaw mechanism @xcite have also been considered recently where neutrino mass generation is linked with the positron excess .",
    "in addition to the above it has been shown that extra dimensional models with kk gravitions can also produce the excess @xcite .",
    "models with nambu - goldstone bosons as dark matter have been studied in @xcite .    in the case of decaying dark matter ,",
    "the relic density constraint of the early universe is not applicable , however , the lifetime of the dark matter particle ( typically of a mass of @xmath45 tev ) should be much much larger than ( @xmath46 times ) the age of the universe@xcite . such a particle can fit the data well .",
    "a crucial difference in this picture with respect to the annihilation picture is that the decay rate is directly proportional to the density of the dark matter ( @xmath47 ) , whereas the annihilation rate is proportional to its square , ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the most promising candidates in the decaying dark matter seem to be a fermion ( scalar ) particle decaying in to @xmath49 _ etc . _",
    "( @xmath50 _ etc . _ ) @xcite . in terms of the bsm physics , supersymmetric models with a heavy gravitino and small r - parity violation",
    "have been proposed as candidates for decaying dark matter @xcite .",
    "a heavy neutralino with @xmath51-parity violation can also play a similar role @xcite stated above .",
    "a recent more general model independent analysis has shown that , assuming the galprop background , gravitino decays can not simultaneously explain both pamela and fermi excess .",
    "however , the presence of additional astrophysical sources can change the situation @xcite .",
    "independent of the gravitino model , it has been pointed out that , the decays of the dark matter particle could be new signals for unification where the dark matter candidate decays through dimension six operators suppressed by two powers of gut scale @xcite .",
    "finally , there has also been some discussion about the possibilities of dark matter consisting of not one particle but two particles , of which one is the decaying partner .",
    "this goes under the name of and analysis of this scenario has been presented by @xcite .",
    "we have so far mentioned just a sample of the theoretical ideas proposed in the literature .",
    "several other equally interesting and exciting ideas have been put forward , which have not been presented to avoid the article becoming too expansive .",
    "an interesting aspect about the present situation is that , future data from pamela and fermi could distinguish whether the astrophysical interpretation _",
    "i.e. _ in terms of pulsars or the particle physics interpretation in terms of dark matter is valid @xcite .",
    "pamela is sensitive to up to 300 gev in its positron fraction and this together with the measurement of the total electron spectrum can strongly effect the dark matter interpretations .",
    "fermi with its improved statistics , can on the other hand look for anisotropies within its data @xcite which can exist if the pulsars are the origin of this excess .",
    "further measurements of the anti - deuteron could possibly gives us a hint why there is no excess in the anti - proton channel @xcite .",
    "similarly neutrino physics experiments could give us valuable information on the possible models@xcite .",
    "finally , the large hadron collider could also give strong hints on the nature of dark matter through direct production @xcite .",
    "as we have been preparing this note , there has been news from one the experiments called cdms - ii ( cryogenic dark matter search experiment)@xcite . as mentioned",
    "before this experiment conducts direct searches for wimp dark matter by looking at collisions of wimps on super - cooled nuclear target material .",
    "the present and final analysis of this experiment have shown two events in the signal region , with the probability of observing two or more background events in that region being close to @xmath52 .",
    "thus , while these results are positive and encouraging , they are not conclusive . however these results already set a stringent upper bound on the wimp - nucleus cross section for a wimp mass of around 70 gev .",
    "the exclusion plots in the parameter space of wimp cross section and wimp mass are presented in the paper @xcite .",
    "the interpretations of this positive signal are quite different compared to the signal of pamela and fermi .",
    "while pamela and fermi as we have seen would require severe modifications for the existing beyond standard model ( bsm ) models of dark matter , cdms results if confirmed would prefer the existing bsm dark matter candidates like neutralino of the supersymmetry .",
    "there are ways of making both pamela / fermi and cdms - ii consistent through dark matter interpretations , however , we will not discuss it further here .",
    "finally , it has been shown that it is possible to make cdms - ii results consistent with dama annual modulation results by assuming a spin - dependent inelastic scattering of wimp on nuclei @xcite .    in the present note",
    ", we have tried to convey exciting developments which have been happening recently within the interface of astrophysics and particle physics , especially on the one of the most intriguing subjects of our time , namely , the _ dark matter_. though it has been proposed about sixty years ago , so far we have not have any conclusive evidence of its existence other than through gravitational interactions , or we do not of its fundamental composition .",
    "experimental searches which have been going on for decades have not bore fruit in answering either of these questions . for these reasons ,",
    "the present indications from pamela and fermi have presented us with a unique opportunity of unraveling at least some of mystery surrounding the dark matter .",
    "these experimental results , if they hold and get confirmed as due to dark matter , would strongly modify the way dark matter was perceived in the scientific community . as a closing point ,",
    "let us note that there are several new experiments being planned to explore the dark matter either directly or indirectly and thus some information about the nature of the dark matter might just around the corner .",
