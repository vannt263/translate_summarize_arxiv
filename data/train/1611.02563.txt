    "a challenging problem in knot theory is writing down an explicit parametrisation of a curve in the form of a given type of knot or link .",

    "in particular , various kinds of knotted fields find application in areas such as topological fluid dynamics @xcite , nonlinear field theories @xcite , nematic liquid crystals @xcite , excitable media @xcite , electromagnetic fields @xcite and optical physics @xcite .",

    ", we show how to generate explicit , complex scalar knotted fields for the family of knots we call _ lemniscate knots _ , which , in a generalisation of the procedure described in @xcite , are built up from explicit constructions of certain braids , which are defined by trigonometric functions .",

    "they are a subclass of so - called _ spiral knots _",

    "theorems related to the nash - tognoli theorem @xcite imply that every knot or link type can be realised as the intersection of the zero sets of two real polynomials in the spatial variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ". however , such theorems are rarely constructive , leaving a physicist or applied mathematician , wishing for an explicit analytic function representation for a knotted field , at a loss on how to proceed .    a construction by brauner in 1928 @xcite gives an explicit realisation of such maps for the @xmath5-torus knot or link .",

    "the group s generators are the crossings @xmath108 , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 labelling the crossing position in order from the left , with positive power for an overcrossing , and the inverse @xmath111 for an undercrossing .",

    "milnor s result however carries over to isolated real singularities .",
    "links of isolated real singularities are fibred links and clearly complex algebraic links must also be real algebraic . explicitly constructing real polynomials with isolated singularities and links of a given type around them",
    "has proven to be challenging with perron s @xcite and rudolph s @xcite constructions of the figure-8 knot , which is not a complex algebraic knot , and a construction of certain odd knots by looijenga @xcite being the only ones of which we are aware .",
    "weakening the condition on the singularity of @xmath26 , allows it to be weakly isolated , and all links arise as links of such singularities , as shown by akbulut and king @xcite .",
    "thus for every link @xmath205 there exists an @xmath77 and an @xmath333 such that the zero set of @xmath77 intersected with any three - sphere of radius less than @xmath274 is @xmath205 . again",
    "the proof is not constructive in the sense that it would allow for an algorithm that explicitly determines one such polynomial for a given link .",

    "however , the construction does not provide any information on the topology of the zero sets on spheres of different radii . the function does not even need to have a singularity at @xmath449 and therefore is not necessarily one of the polynomials whose existence was shown by akbulut and king .",

    "consider now the zero set of @xmath43 on the three - sphere of radius @xmath283 .",
    "it is exactly @xmath459 , where @xmath205 is the zero set of @xmath460 on the unit three - sphere .",
    "we know that for small values of @xmath283 this is equal to the desired link by construction . hence intersecting the zero set of @xmath43 with a three - sphere of radius @xmath283 results in the desired link for @xmath461 .",
    "note that this is the same @xmath274 as above .    by construction @xmath352",
    "is a singular point of @xmath43 .",
    "also we have seen that all points on @xmath273 are regular for small enough @xmath256 .",
    "thus for small enough @xmath283 , all points on @xmath462 are regular and hence the singular point at @xmath352 is weakly isolated .",
    "thus @xmath43 satisfies all conditions from akbulut and king s existence theorem .",
    "similar , but more elaborate arguments justify an explicit construction of real polynomials with weakly isolated singularities for any lemniscate link .",
    "we have shown how a natural generalisation of brauner s almost century - old construction of functions for torus knots can be adapted to make polynomial maps from @xmath12 ( or @xmath11 ) to @xmath309 whose zeros have the form of knots and links in a family we call the lemniscate knots ( generalising the torus knots ) .",
    "the explicit construction parametrises a braid representation of the knot trigonometrically , which become polynomials under the mathematical procedure of closing the braid .",
    "lemniscate knots are fibred , and with appropriate choice of the parameters , these maps are also fibrations , and for certain lemniscate knots , the maps can be extended to weakly isolated singularities .",
    "we have outlined some physical applications of these explicit maps , and some generalisations , in linear and nonlinear physics .",
    "the lemniscate knots form a particularly symmetric subset of spiral knots , and we have proved and conjectured properties of both families .",
    "other trends may be general ; for instance , on the basis of the explicit examples we have , is seems plausible that minimum braid words of lemniscate knots are ( anti)palindromic .",
    "preliminary investigation suggests that hyperbolic volume of families of lemniscate knots for increasing @xmath463 and @xmath0 , tends to increase , suggesting that other simple knots do not occur as complex lemniscate knots .",
    "polynomial maps @xmath77 can obviously be constructed for knots and links which are are closures of more general @xmath464 lissajous braids with coprime @xmath465 .",
    "such braids are not homogeneous so such knots are not spiral , despite some properties from theorem [ spiral ] applying , such as being being periodic with period @xmath29 .",
    "the simplest nontrivial knot is based on the @xmath466 lissajous figure , with @xmath467 , represented by @xmath468 .",
    "this apparently closes to a knot with @xmath469 crossings , so these knots seem likely to appear beyond standard tabulations .",
    "similar knots formed as closures of general lissajous braids , without the restriction that @xmath21 is less than @xmath110 or @xmath0 , have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "thus the construction of maps @xmath77 extends beyond the lemniscate knots which have been our emphasis , not only to higher lissajous figures , but also the generalisations in section [ sec : fibration ] which included a composite and a cable knot .",
    "all of these generalisations apply to the ( trigonometric ) braid , but the same basic algebraic procedure leads to the polynomial map @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , the identification of the braid with the zeros of the polynomial family @xmath78 from @xmath470 guarantees that @xmath77 is semiholomorphic , which is a powerful property ( it is this property that allows the degree of the rational map described in section [ sec : applications ] to be controlled ) .    having explicit functions for knotted fields is particularly useful in applications to construct knotted fields in physical systems .",
    "the polynomial maps @xmath77 and @xmath43 which can be adapted for a variety of systems ( either simply by multiplying by an overall weight function to aid normalisation , or in a more complicated way to alter the domain and target spaces ) .",
    "the procedure in fact gives polynomials whose coefficients are all integers ; since the knotted zeros are structurally stable , the coefficients may be smoothly perturbed ( such as the holograms in @xcite , or the rational map ( [ eq : fig8hopf ] ) ) to optimise some physically - motivated merit function without destroying the nodal topology . from a physical point of view",
    ", the mathematical procedure is a way of finding a topologically - interesting region of ( possibly high - dimensional ) parameter space , for which physical principles are required to understand the significance of knotted fields .",
    "we begin by showing the braid word of the @xmath471 lemniscate knot can be written @xmath472 .",
    "this then agrees ( for low values of @xmath198 ) with the minimum braid word for the knots in table [ tab : ell=2 ] found by @xcite .",
    "the basic word for @xmath473 lemniscate braids with @xmath154 is , from the discussion in section [ sec : braids ] , given by @xmath474 ( since anagrams of isograms are equivalent ) .",
    "the knots in question thus have braid word @xmath475 ^ 2 & = & \\sigma_1^{-1 } \\sigma_2^{-1 } \\cdots \\sigma_n^{-1 } \\sigma_{n+1 } \\cdots \\sigma_{2n } \\sigma_1^{-1 } \\sigma_2^{-1 } \\cdots \\sigma_n^{-1 } \\sigma_{n+1 } \\cdots \\sigma_{2n } \\\\     & = & \\sigma_1^{-1 } \\sigma_2^{-1 } \\sigma_1^{-1 } \\sigma_3^{-1 } \\sigma_2^{-1 } \\sigma_4^{-1 } \\cdots \\sigma_{n-1}^{-1 } \\sigma_n^{-1 } \\sigma_{n+1 } \\sigma_n^{-1 } \\cdots \\sigma_{2n } \\sigma_{2n-1 } \\sigma_{2n}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rearrangement in the second line represents a rearrangement where all generators are moved as near to the beginning of the word without meeting another generator with which they do not commute .",

    ", we use the burau representation of the braid group @xcite on the braid word @xmath479 .",
    "since the alexander polynomial does not distinguish between mirror image ( and the knots in question are ampicheiral anyway ) , the calculated alexander polynomial is that of @xmath480 .",
    "the matrix representatives of @xmath118 and @xmath481 are given respectively by @xmath482 of which the @xmath198th powers are ( as easily verifiable by induction ) @xmath483 where @xmath484 and @xmath485 .",
    "this means the full braid word is represented by @xmath486 the alexander polynomial @xmath487 is now found by computing the determinant of a @xmath488 minor of this matrix minus the identity matrix , from which it can be seen ( using @xmath489 ) that @xmath490 .",

    "any closing arc connecting the bottom end of one strand with the top end of another can be taken , and placed either on top or below the braid as shown in figure [ fig : diagram ] ( c ) , which can be done so that it cancels all crossings on the top .",
    "the resulting diagram can be easily brought into the form of a 4-plait as in figure [ fig : diagram](d ) , so @xmath205 is rational .",
    "note that by placing the closing arcs such that they cancel the crossings on the top , they also cancel the crossings on the bottom if @xmath496 .",
