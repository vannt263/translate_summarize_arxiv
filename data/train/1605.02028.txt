    "understanding the spatial structure of ecological networks is vital in theoretical and experimental biology and ecology @xcite .",

    "a spatial setting , where individuals interact locally and are mobile , strongly influences the dynamics of the system and also has a large impact on the stability of an ecological network @xcite .",
    "the introduction of space gives rise to rich , interaction network dependent , phenomena including pattern formation , cluster coarsening , alliance formation and nested ecological niches .",
    "these phenomena have yielded a huge theoretical interest recently , and a variety of techniques @xcite have been employed to study these intriguing phenomena for symmetric networks , ranging from simple cases with three @xcite and four species @xcite to complex situations with an arbitrary number of species @xcite .",
    "realistic ecologies , however , are endowed with complex interaction networks that can not be captured fully by only considering symmetric networks . as such it is important to develop theoretical approaches that allow to understand the dynamics of general networks @xcite and their effects on biodiversity , correlations , and spatio - temporal patterns .    in the following",
    "we present an exact method that allows to reveal why species are partitioned in domains and what are the partition sets of the species labels in complex food networks .",
    "this information is a necessary first step in order to develop a predictive theory for the fate of ecologies .",
    "our approach predicts the alliance formation between different species and fixes the emerging space - time patterns in many spatial interaction networks . as a consequence ,",
    "our approach also permits to shed light on the stability of ecological niches by breaking down this stability question into two distinctive parts : the stability of interactions among domains and within domains .",

    "contains many known situations as for example the cyclic @xmath8 species lotka - volterra and may - leonard models as well as more complicated situations like the @xmath19 models where each species preys on @xmath20 other species in a cyclic way @xcite . whereas the examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are those of @xmath19 models with symmetric rates ( hence we can drop the labels @xmath10 , @xmath21 for the rates , see the figure caption ) , more general cases will be discussed below .",
    "the matrix approach discussed in the following is valid for rather general predator - prey networks , provided that no interactions of higher order than second order are present .",
    "we assume that the species network gives rise to a unique partition of the species into domains .",
    "while we have not encountered a case where this assumption is not fulfilled , we can not exclude that there exist networks of species that exhibit in presence of noise two non - isomorphic partitions of species into domains .",
    "for the cases used to illustrate our approach , we consider rates for which none of the species go extinct before the quasi - steady state of the dynamics is reached , i.e. the time scale on which the species are forming alliances and domains is shorter than the extinction time for any of the species .",
    "notably this requires that the diffusion and mobility rates are not too high so as to induce rapid extinction of the species , but are still large enough to allow the formation of species alliances .",
    "the predation scheme ( [ model1 ] ) can be represented by a graph where one connects species @xmath10 and @xmath21 by a directed edge if @xmath10 preys on @xmath21 .",

    "<S> predicting the fate of ecologies is a daunting , albeit extremely important , task . as part of this task one needs to develop an understanding of the organization , hierarchies , and correlations among the species forming the ecology . focusing on complex food networks we present a theoretical method that allows to achieve this understanding . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the adjacency matrix the method derives specific matrices that encode the various inter - species relationships . </S>",
    "<S> the full potential of the method is achieved in a spatial setting where one obtains detailed predictions for the emerging space - time patterns . for a variety of cases </S>",
