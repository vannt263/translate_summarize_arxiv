    "there exist several approaches in the study of chaotic behavior of dynamical systems using the concepts such as ( 1 ) entropy and dynamical entropy , ( 2 ) chaitin s complexity , ( 3 ) lyapunov exponent ( 4 ) fractal dimension ( 5 ) bifurcation ( 6 ) ergodicity @xcite .",
    "but these concepts are rather independently used in each field . in 1991 , one of the authors",
    "proposed information dynamics ( i d for short ) @xcite to try to treat such chaotic behavior of systems from a common standing point .",
    "then a chaos degree to measure the chaos in dynamical systems is defined by means of two complexities in id@xcite . in particular , among several chaos degrees , the entropic chaos degree was introduced in @xcite and it is applied to some dynamical systems@xcite . recently ,",
    "semiclassical properties and chaos degree for quantum baker s map has been considered in @xcite .    in this paper , we give a new treatment of quantum chaos by introducing the chaos degree for quantum transition dynamics , and we prove some fundamental properties for non - chaotic maps .",
    "moreover we show , as an example , that our chaos degree well describes chaotic behavior of spin systems .",
    "in order to contain more general dynamics such as one in continuous systems , we define the entropic chaos degree in c*-algebraic terminology .",
    "this setting will be too general in the sequel discussions , but for mathematical completeness including both classical and quantum systems , we start from the c*-algebraic setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be an input c * system and @xmath1 be an output c * system ; namely , @xmath2 is a c * algebra with unit @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the set of all states on @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath5 in the sequel for simplicity . for",
    "a weak * compact convex subset @xmath6 ( called the reference space ) of @xmath4 , take a state @xmath7 from the set @xmath6 and let    @xmath8    be an extremal orthogonal decomposition of @xmath7 in@xmath9 , whose measure @xmath10 describes a certain degree of mixture of @xmath7 in the reference space @xmath6 .",
    "the measure @xmath10 is not uniquely determined unless @xmath6 is the choquet simplex , so that the set of all such measures is denoted by @xmath11    the entropic chaos degree with respect to @xmath12 and a channel @xmath13 a map from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , is defined by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mixing entropy of a state @xmath18 in the reference space @xmath19 @xcite , hence it becomes von neumann entropy when @xmath4 is the set of all density operaotrs , or it does shannon entropy when @xmath4 is the set of all probability distributions .",
    "this @xmath20 contains the classical chaos degree and the quantum one .",
    "now in the case of @xmath21 we simply denote @xmath22 by @xmath23    we use this degree to judge whether the dynamics @xmath24 causes a chaos or not as follows :    for a give state @xmath25 a dynamics @xmath24 causes chaos iff @xmath26 , and it does cause chaos ( i.e. , may be called stable ) iff @xmath27 .    in usual quantum system including classical discrete system , @xmath2 is the set @xmath28 of all bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath29 and @xmath4 is the set of all density operators , in which an extremal decomposition of @xmath30 is a schatten decomposition @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 are one dimensional orthogonal projections with @xmath33 so that the entropic chaos degree is written as    @xmath34    where the infimum is taken over all possible schatten decompositions and @xmath35 is von neumann entropy .",
    "note that in classical discrete case , the schatten decomposition is unique @xmath36 with the delta measure @xmath37 and the entropic chaos degree is written by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the probability distribution of the orbit obtained from a dynamics of a system , and that dynamics generates the channel @xmath13 whose details are discussed in section 2 . before closing this section we remark that in the case when a certain decomposition of the state @xmath39 is fixed , say @xmath40 , @xmath41 the entropic chaos degree ( ecd in the sequel ) becomes    @xmath42    without the infimum .",
    "let us consider a map @xmath43 on @xmath44 ^{\\mathbf{n}}\\subset   \\mathbf{r}^{\\mathbf{n}}$ ] with @xmath45 ( a difference equation ) , @xmath46 .",
    "take a finite partition of @xmath47 @xmath48 with @xmath49 @xmath50 the state @xmath51 at time @xmath52 determined by the difference equation is the probability distribution @xmath53 @xmath54 of the orbit @xmath55 , that is ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the characteristic function and @xmath58 .",
    "when the initial value @xmath59 is distributed due to a measure @xmath60 on @xmath61 the above @xmath62 is given as    @xmath63    the joint probability distribution @xmath64 between the time @xmath52 and @xmath65 is defined by    @xmath66    or    @xmath67    then the channel @xmath68 at @xmath52 is defined by    @xmath69    and the chaos degree at time @xmath52 is given by    @xmath70    therefore once we find a suitable partition @xmath71 such that @xmath72 becomes positive , we conclude that the dynamics @xmath43 produces chaos .",
    "this entropic chaos degree has been applied to several dynamical maps such logistic map , baker s transformation and tinkerbel map , and it could explain their chaotic characters@xcite .",

    "( [ 3.6 ] ) one finds that    @xmath79    and    @xmath80    that is , the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is linear one .",
    "let us put    @xmath83    then one finds    @xmath84    the time dependence of @xmath85 is generally very complicated .",
    "one can consider as an example the following case .",
    "let @xmath86 be selfadjoint operators such that @xmath87 are linearly independent .",
    "suppose that @xmath88 where @xmath89 are solutions of the equations    @xmath90    with initial conditions    @xmath91    and it is assumed that    @xmath92    the equations ( [ 3.13 ] ) can lead to chaos .",
    "however its discrete version is quite complicated .",
