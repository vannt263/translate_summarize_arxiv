    "a quantum channel is a completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) map on quantum states .",
    "the condition that it is completely positive means that the result of the map is a positive operator , and therefore may represent the state of a system , even if the map acts on one part of an entangled system .",
    "the condition that it is trace preserving ensures that the final state is normalised .",
    "in contrast to unitary operations , quantum channels can increase the entropy of a state .",
    "a quantum channel arises if an ancilla space is added , a unitary operation is performed between the system and the ancilla , then the ancilla is traced over to obtain the reduced density operator for the system .",
    "quantum channels are used to model communication channels , and therefore an important quantity to consider for these channels is the amount of classical communication that may be performed .",
    "this is often quantified by the holevo capacity .",
    "the holevo capacity of a quantum channel @xmath0 is given by @xmath1-\\sum_i p_i s[\\phi(\\rho_i)],\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the @xmath4 are probabilities , and therefore must be non - negative and sum to 1 . the holevo capacity is the asymptotic classical communication that may be achieved using joint measurements on output states , but unentangled inputs @xcite . in general",
    "determining the holevo capacity of a channel is a nontrivial task .",
    "for the class of channels considered here , it will be shown that the capacity may be determined in a straightforward way .",
    "an important issue is the number of states @xmath5 that must be considered in the maximisation .",
    "it is well known that , for quantum channels that act upon a hilbert space of dimension @xmath6 , the number of states in the ensemble need not exceed @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a qubit channel no more than four states are required . for the very simple case of unital qubit channels , where @xmath8",
    ", the capacity is achieved for two orthogonal input states @xcite . for more general qubit channels ,",
    "the capacity may be achieved for two non - orthogonal inputs @xcite , three states @xcite , or four states may be required @xcite .    with the exception of the channels considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , these results are all for a class of channels that can require at most three states . here",
    "we give simple criteria for these channels that , when satisfied , mean that two states are sufficient .",
    "these criteria are not satisfied by the channels that require three states given in @xcite , but are satisfied by examples given in refs .",
    "@xcite where two states are sufficient .",
    "in addition , we give criteria to determine when the input states should be orthogonal or non - orthogonal .",

    "@xmath17    that is , an arbitrary qubit channel @xmath0 may be expressed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are unitary channels , and @xmath21 is the channel with @xmath15 and @xmath16 given by .",
    "for this study , we consider the restricted case of channels @xmath0 such that the @xmath22 and @xmath23 components of @xmath16 are zero , and use the notation @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath16 is given by @xmath25    in order to evaluate the holevo capacity , we use an approach similar to that of ref .",
    "the holevo capacity may be given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the relative entropy @xmath28 throughout this paper we use the convention that `` @xmath29 '' and `` @xmath30 '' are base 2 , and logarithms base @xmath31 are given as `` @xmath32 '' .",
    "the relative entropy can be evaluated using the following useful result from @xcite : @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 the bloch vectors for @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath12 and @xmath37 , respectively , and we also define @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .    to evaluate the holevo capacity , we consider the action of the simplified channel @xmath21 .",
    "this channel has the same capacity as @xmath0 , because unitary operations do not affect the capacity .",
    "the set of possible output states from the channel @xmath21 forms an ellipsoid centred on the @xmath41 axis . the ellipsoid has a radius of @xmath42 in the @xmath22 direction , and a radius of @xmath43 in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the nature of the optimal ensemble may be determined by considering the states in the minmax formula . in the following",
    "we take the states @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be output states from the simplified channel . if @xmath36 is the average output density operator for an optimal ensemble , the operators @xmath46 that maximise @xmath47 are possible output states for this ensemble .",

    "for each optimal @xmath46 , there is a circle of optimal density operators around the @xmath41 axis .",

    "@xmath79 , the radius is independent of @xmath76 .",
    "this possibility will be excluded in the discussion of @xmath72 , because @xmath68 is an alternative criterion to @xmath69 , and leads to infinite @xmath72 .",

    "we find that , in this case , @xmath128 , so @xmath69 is satisfied and theorem [ th1 ] predicts that the optimal ensemble requires two states . for this channel , @xmath136 and @xmath90 , which corresponds to condition 2 in theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] therefore predicts that , for this channel , the optimal ensemble consists of two states at the same distance from the @xmath187 plane , rather than on the @xmath41 axis .",
    "this is what was found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another channel is the shifted depolarising channel , which was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this channel , @xmath188 and @xmath186 . as @xmath189 , theorem [ th1 ] applies , and the ensemble should require only two states .",
    "this result is what was found in @xcite .",
    "also , because @xmath189 , condition 1 in theorem [ th2 ] holds , so theorem [ th2 ] predicts that the states in the optimal ensemble lie on the @xmath41 axis .",
    "this is also consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , let us consider the examples given in @xcite that require three states .",
    "for one of these examples , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , so @xmath192 .",
    "this is in the interval @xmath193 , so it is not surprising that three states are required .",
    "another example is @xmath194 and @xmath195 ; in this case @xmath72 is about 0.278 , which is again in the interval @xmath193 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a strategy used to find channels that require three states was to vary the parameters from a channel such that the optimal states are on the @xmath41 axis to one where the optimal states are away from the @xmath41 axis .",
    "this strategy can alternatively be explained in terms of theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "the channel parameters can not be continuously varied from condition 1 to condition 2 without @xmath72 passing through the interval @xmath193 .",
    "that is because it is not possible to continuously vary the channel parameters from @xmath87 to @xmath136 while maintaining the same sign for @xmath72 .    to take an example from @xcite ,",

    "if one introduces an ancilla qubit , performs a unitary operation , then traces over this ancilla qubit , the resulting operation is of this form @xcite .",
    "maps of this form also arise naturally when considering extremal maps @xcite .",
    "also , it is known that all qubit maps with two kraus operators are of this form @xcite .    for maps of this form , we find that @xmath128 , so the conditions of theorem [ th1 ] are satisfied . therefore",
    ", for maps that arise from a unitary interaction with an ancilla qubit , the optimal ensemble requires only two states .",
    "this result was also claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the complete proof was not given .",
    "in addition , @xmath204 , so from theorem [ th2 ] the two states for the optimal ensemble are away from the @xmath41 axis .",
    "in the case where three states are required for the optimal ensemble , it is possible to show that one of the states needs to be on the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the result is    [ th3 ] consider a cptp map @xmath21 with @xmath15 given by and @xmath16 given by . if the holevo capacity can not be achieved with a two - state ensemble , then any optimal ensemble with three states consists of one state on the @xmath41 axis , and two states equidistant from the @xmath41 axis and on a line perpendicular to and intersecting the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the optimal input state on the @xmath41 axis is @xmath182 if @xmath205 , and @xmath183 if @xmath206 .    in order to prove the result , we start by considering the expression in square brackets in .",
    "although @xmath122 can change sign , it is only zero for one value of @xmath74 . to show this result",
    ", we use the following facts : @xmath207 these inequalities are all for @xmath208 , and are easily checked by plotting the functions . if @xmath209 for @xmath210 , then @xmath211 , so @xmath212 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath209 for @xmath210 , then @xmath122 is increasing for @xmath210 .",
    "this implies that , if there is a value of @xmath74 for which @xmath213 , then @xmath143 for all larger values of @xmath74 .",
    "hence @xmath122 can be zero for only one value of @xmath74 in @xmath214 .",
    "recall that , if there is an extremum of @xmath74 for @xmath84 , then the condition @xmath215 is satisfied , and therefore the optimal ensemble requires no more than two states . in the conditions for theorem [ th3 ] , the optimal ensemble requires more than two states , so @xmath74 has no extremum for @xmath84 .",
    "hence @xmath74 is a one - to - one function for @xmath76 in the interval @xmath111 . combining this result with the above reasoning",
    ", the rhs of can be zero for only one value of @xmath76 in the interval @xmath111 .",
    "these results imply that the lhs of can have a turning point for only one value of @xmath76 in @xmath111 , and therefore there are at most two solutions of for @xmath126 . in turn",
    "this implies that there are no more than two extrema of @xmath106 for @xmath126 .",
    "in fact , there must be exactly two ( if @xmath36 is optimal ) , because if there were only one , then the optimal ensemble would require only two states , which violates the conditions of theorem [ th3 ] .",
    "thus there will be two extrema of @xmath106 for @xmath126 , two symmetric extrema for @xmath216 , and extrema at @xmath108 and @xmath133 .",
    "these extrema must alternate between minima and maxima , and so one of the extrema at @xmath108 and @xmath133 will be a maximum , and the other will be a minimum . to determine which points",
    "are minima and which are maxima , consider the second derivative of @xmath106 at a solution of : @xmath217.\\ ] ] recall that , if @xmath122 is positive for @xmath210 , it must also be positive for @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , for the solution of with smaller @xmath74 , @xmath122 is negative , and for the solution with larger @xmath74 , @xmath122 is positive .    for maps that require three states to achieve the holevo capacity , @xmath137 .",
    "as discussed above , this implies that @xmath136 , so @xmath198 is positive .",
    "thus multiplication by @xmath197 does not change the sign , so the solution of with smaller @xmath74 is a maximum , and the solution with larger @xmath74 is a minimum . as the extrema alternate between maxima and minima , the extremum on the @xmath41 axis that is closer to the origin must be a minimum .",
    "therefore , if @xmath219 is greater than @xmath220 , then the optimal output state on the @xmath41 axis will be at @xmath221 .",

    "if @xmath64 , then optimal ensembles may contain any states from a circle about the @xmath41 axis . however , for optimal ensembles with three states , the condition that the mean state is on the @xmath41 axis restricts the remaining two states to be equidistant from the @xmath41 axis , and on a line perpendicular to and intersecting the @xmath41 axis",
    "these results enable us to determine numerically efficient ways of calculating capacities . in the case that the channel satisfies the conditions of theorem [ th1 ] , the problem becomes particularly simple .",

    "because @xmath36 must be the average of the two @xmath46 , and the @xmath41 components of the two @xmath231 are equal , the @xmath41 component of @xmath37 must also be equal .",

    "if two states are sufficient for the optimal ensemble , these states must correspond to @xmath223 , because otherwise @xmath36 would not be on the @xmath41 axis .",

    "if neither of these methods gives the optimal ensemble , then we have eliminated all possibilities for optimal two - state ensembles , and the optimal ensemble must require three states .",
