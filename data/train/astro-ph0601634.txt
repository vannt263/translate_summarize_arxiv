    "structure formation and evolution in the universe and the formation and growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are two fundamental problems in astronomy which are still not fully understood . while recent progresses in the cosmic microwave background , the high redshift type ia supernovae survey , and the large optical surveys have significantly improved our understanding of the evolution of large scale structure , there are still several gaps in the picture of structure formation . the data at redshift of @xmath23 , where most of the cosmic star formation might have taken place , is still very limited . on scales of galaxies and cluster of galaxies ,",
    "the feed back process from galaxies or agns could significantly alter structure formation models where gravitation is the only driving force .",
    "the clustering of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provides unique path to the solution of these problems because ( 1 ) the agns are often bright compared to normal galaxies and are easily seen at large cosmological distance ; ( 2 ) agns trace the violent growth phase of smbhs and hence their clustering properties provide a link between the dark matter halo to the agn activity .",
    "large scale agn surveys have been traditionally carried out in the optical band with dedicated telescopes .",
    "the most recent of these are the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , schneider et  al .",
    "2004 ) and the two degree field survey ( 2df , croom et  al .",
    "2005 , c05 hereafter ) .",
    "these surveys have demonstrated that the clustering of agns can be used to measure cosmological parameters ( croom et  al .",
    "2004 ; outram et  al .",
    "2004 ) , and to constrain gravitational lensing ( myers et  al .",
    "2003 ) . however , as has been found in recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ deep surveys , a large fraction of x - ray detected agns show little or no activity in optical observations ( e.g. barger et  al .",
    "2005 ) , most probably due to obscuration ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) but possibly with some contribution from light dilution of the host galaxy ( moran , filippenko , & chornock 2002 ) , though barger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue this is not a dominant factor .",
    "this results in a large fraction of agns being missed in the optical surveys . on the other hand , hard x - rays ( @xmath24  kev )",
    "is almost unaffected by obscuring column densities @xmath25  @xmath26 , and the x - ray emission from the host galaxies is low compared to the agns . thus hard x - rays are at present the best energy band to find agns ( mushotzky 2004 ) .",
    "recent optical follow - ups of _ chandra _ deep surveys have revealed that the hard x - ray sources are mostly found around @xmath27 instead of @xmath28 as seen in optically selected quasar samples .",
    "the low redshift population is dominated by non - broadline objects , while broadline agns are found mostly at higher redshifts ( steffen et  al .",
    "2003 ) . given these new discoveries , it is important to know how the clustering properties of x - ray and optical selected agn differ .",
    "the most extensive x - ray agn surveys so far performed used the _",
    "telescope ( mullis et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "because the telescope is not sensitive above 2 kev , _ rosat _ misses a large fraction of hard x - ray sources .",
    "the relatively poor spatial resolution of rosat also limits the accuracy of optical identifications .",
    "most of the _ rosat _ detected agns show broad emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "both the optical quasar surveys and the rosat surveys suggest that agns have correlation properties similar to the local galaxies .",
    "the results seem to be independant of the sample medium redshifts .",
    "this result is puzzling because agns are believed to be preferentially form in high density peaks where interactions between galaxies are more common , and interactions in turn are thought to be crucial in agn fueling ( di matteo , springel , & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "the mass of the dark matter halos that host agns are hence likely to be more massive .",
    "the clustering results on hard x - ray agns are so far contradictory .",
    "earlier studies of a small number of individual _ chandra _ fields seem to indicate that the hard band number counts in these small fields has fluctuations larger than expected from poisson noise ( cowie et  al . 2002 ; manners et  al .",
    "2003 ) but the result is contradicted with larger samples of _ chandra _ fields ( kim et  al .",

    "clasxs is a 0.4  deg@xmath0 contiguous field centered at @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( j2000 ) in the very low galactic absorption lockman hole northwest region .",
    "it is the deepest 170@xmath37 m survey field observed by isophot instrument on board _ iso _ , and has recently been observed by the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( lonsdale et  al .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observation consists of 9 acis - i pointings separated from each other by @xmath38 to allow a close to uniform sky coverage .",
    "the center field has an exposure time of @xmath39  ks while the other eight pointings , have exposure times of @xmath40  ks .",
    "the exposure time were designed to give a uniform flux limit of @xmath41  , which is about a factor of 2 below the `` knee '' of the logn - logs curve .",
    "this choice of sensitivity allows a proper sampling of the x - ray background sources and also achieves a highest source finding efficiency .",
    "the sub - arcsecond spatial resolution of _ chandra _ observatory allows an unambiguous optical identification of the x - ray sources , particularly , for those which appear to be normal galaxies in optical band .",
    "combined with follow - ups using the large keck and subaru optical telescopes , we identified and measured the redshifts in a large fraction of the x - ray detected agns in our survey .",
    "the details and the catalogs of the survey can be found in yang et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and steffen et  al .",
    "we performed spectroscopic observations for @xmath42 of the 525 detected x - ray sources .",
    "a total of 272 spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained , while the spectra of the rest of the sources have a signal - to - noise ratio too low to obtain secure redshift measurements .",
    "the redshift distribution of the identified sources are shown in figure  [ z_dist ] .",
    "the fraction of sources with spectroscopic redshift as a function of hard x - ray flux is shown in figure  [ optical_id ] .",
    "the 2  ms cdfn is so far the deepest _ chandra _ field , reaching a flux limit of @xmath43  ( alexander et  al . 2003 ) .",
    "this is @xmath44 times deeper than the clasxs field .",
    "the areal density of sources in cdfn is also @xmath45 times higher .",
    "the optical observation were performed using the same telescope as clasxs ( barger et  al .",
    "we use the published catalog , which contains 306 sources with spectroscopic redshift .",
    "the redshift distribution of the cdfn sources is also shown in figure  [ z_dist ] .",
    "the fainter x - ray sources in the cdfn are more likely to be found at low redshift , @xmath46 , compared to the clasxs sources .",
    "to quantify spatial clustering in a point process , the most commonly used technique is the two point correlation function . in short , a two point correlation function measures the excess probability of finding a pair of objects as a function of pair separation ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "@xmath47dv_{1}dv_{2 } \\label{acf_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the mean density and @xmath49 is the _ comoving _ distance between two sources .",
    "observations of low redshift galaxies and clusters of galaxies show that the correlation function of these objects over a wide range of scales can be described by a power - law @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( peebles 1980 ; peacock 1999 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the correlation function is in fact a function of redshift , which we will discuss in   [ sec_evolution ] . because of the small sample sizes of most of the agn surveys , correlation functions over very wide redshift ranges are commonly used .",
    "this only makes sense if the clustering is almost constant in comoving coordinates .",
    "fortunately , this is very close to the truth , as we shall see in   [ sec_evolution ] .",
    "the nominal distance between sources calculated using the sky coordinates of the sources and their redshifts is sometimes called distance in _ redshift - space _ , we shall use @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 to indicate the distance calculated this way .",
    "it is apparent that the line - of - sight peculiar velocity of the sources could also contribute to the measured redshift ( redshift distortion ) .",
    "this effect is most important at separations smaller than the correlation length .",
    "the projected correlation function , which computes the integrated correlation function along the line - of - sight and is not affected by redshift distortion , is often used to obtain the real - space correlation function ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the projection , however , could make the correlation signal more difficult to measure . in small fields like the cdfn , the projected correlation function",
    "is also restricted by the field size , and could be affected by cosmic variance .",
    "we will calculate both the redshift - space and projected correlation functions in this paper .",
    "this allows us to estimate the effects of redshift distortion .    following davis & peebles 1983",
    ", we define @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be the positions of two sources in the redshift - space , @xmath56 to be the redshift - space separation , and @xmath57 to be the mean distance to the pair of sources .",
    "we can then compute the correlation function @xmath58 on a two dimensional grid , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are separations along and across the line - of - sight respectively : @xmath61 @xmath62 the projected correlation function is defined as the line - of - sight integration of @xmath58 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the line - of - sight separation .",
    "it has been shown ( davis & peebles 1983 ) that , when @xmath65 , @xmath66 satisfies a simple relation with the real - space correlation function .",
    "if a power - law form in equation [ powerlaw ] is assumed , then @xmath67 in practice , the integration is not performed to very large separations because the major contribution to the projected signal comes from separations of a few times the correlation length @xmath68 .",
    "integrating to larger @xmath59 will only add noise to the results .",
    "after testing various scales , we found @xmath69  mpc produces consistent results for our samples .      to obtain an unbiased estimate of the correlation function",
    ", we must correct for selection effects .",
    "usually , these selection effects are treated using random samples generated with computer simulations . by comparing the simulated and observed pair distributions ,",
    "the selection functions effectively cancel .",
    "we compute the correlation function using the minimum variance estimator @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the numbers of data - data , data - random and random - random pairs respectively , with comoving distances @xmath74 ( l - s estimator , landy & szalay 1993 ) .",
    "the random catalog is produced through simulations described below to account for the selection effects in observations .",
    "the random catalog usually contains a very large number of objects so that the poisson noise introduced is negligible .",
    "we have checked our results using both l - s and the davis - peebles estimators ( davis & peebles 1983 ) and found very good agreement between the two methods .",
    "there are two terms in the uncertainty of the correlation function : the statistical fluctuations and the cosmic variance .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the correlation function is estimated assuming the error of the dr and rr pairs are zero , and the uncertainty of dd is poissonian , @xmath75 in the case of small dd , where @xmath76 underestimates the error , we use the approximation formula ( gehrels 1986 ) to calculate the poisson upper and lower limits .",
    "since the dds are in fact correlated , the use of poisson errors could underestimate the real uncertainty . in the literature _ bootstrap _ resampling ( efron 1982 ) is often used to calculate the errors of the correlation function .",
    "the method is particularly useful in cases when the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the variable is unknown , or in cases when the variables are derived from poissonian distributed data using complex transformations , which results in rather complex pdfs .",
    "mo , jing , & boerner ( 1992 ) showed that in the case of large dd , the bootstrap error is @xmath77 of the poisson error .",
    "we use poisson errors in our redshift - space correlation function estimates .",
    "on the other hand , we use bootstrap methods when estimating the uncertainties of the projected correlation function .",
    "this is because the numerical integration used in equation  [ wp ] make it difficult to apply poisson errors directly .",
    "cosmic variance is known to affect the estimation of the mean density when applied to small samples of normal galaxies from optical surveys .",
    "such effect , however , is likely to be small on our x - ray selected agn sample for the following reasons .",
    "the volumn of our survey is very large compared to the typical pensil - beam optical survey of normal galaxies that typically covers very narrow redshift ranges . on the other hand , the number density of agns is much lower than that of the normal galaxies , making it hard to trace individual structures at high enough sampling rate .",
    "the window function of the spectroscopic follow - up in our survey is also very flat over a wide redshift range ( except in the redshift desert at @xmath78 ) .",
    "the combination of these factors makes it very difficult for a small number of structures been over sampled and thus producing incorrect estimation of the mean density .",
    "however , for ultra deep surveys with field size of a single _ chandra _ field , small number of velocity spikes can indeed affect the correlation analysis , as seen in the case of the chandra deep field south .",
    "such structure , however , will affect number counts in the field at flux levels comparable to the depth of clasxs .",
    "based on the very good agreement among the number counts found in the clasxs , cdfn , and other deep surveys ( yang et al .",
    "2004 ) , we believe the uncertainty from cosmic variance on the whole sample is likely to be small",
    ". however , the cosmic variance effect on subsamples could still be important , as seen in ",
    "[ sec_evolution ] .",
    "in such cases , using statistical uncertainty alone could underestimates the true uncertainty .      to account for the observational selection and edge effects",
    ", we perform extensive simulations to construct a mock catalog .",
    "the _ chandra _ detection sensitivity is not uniform because of vignetting effects , quantum efficiency changes across the field and the broadening of the point spread functions .",
    "the consequence is that the sensitivity of source detection drops monotonically with off - axis angles . to quantify this we generate simulated observations of our 40 ks and 70 ks exposure in both soft and hard bands . using _",
    "( freeman et  al .",
    "2002 ) on these images we obtain an estimate of the detection probability function at different fluxes and off - axis angles ( figure  [ det_prob ] ) .    with this probability , we can generate randomly distributed sources with the x - ray selection effects to the first order .",
    "we use this method instead of running detections on a large number of simulated images because the detection program runs very slowly on these images .",
    "we generate source fluxes based on the best fit logn - logs from yang et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and then `` detections '' are run on each of the images . the resulting catalogs from all the nine simulated images are then merged in the same way as for the real data .",
    "the resulting random source distribution and the resulting cumulative counts are shown in figure  [ simulation ] .",
    "we next consider the optical selection effects .",
    "since our spectroscopic observation is close to complete for all sources with r@xmath79 , the sky coverage is uniform and only a very small number of sources which are very close to each other could be missed .",
    "this might reduce the power at very small scales .",
    "the redshift distribution of the sources shows a very weak dependence on the x - ray flux ( figure  [ z_flux ] ) , which is due largely to the very broad luminosity function of agns .",
    "we can thus `` scramble '' the observed redshifts and assign them to the simulated sample without introducing a significant bias .",
    "the major selection effect in our optical observation is that the optical identifications are biased toward brighter sources .",
    "we select the simulated sources based on their x - ray flux using the best - fit curve in figure  [ optical_id ] as a probability function .",
    "the optical selection removes a large fraction of x - ray dim sources and therefore reduces the non - uniformity in the angular distribution caused by the x - ray selection effects .",
    "the redshift of the random sources were sampled from a gaussian smoothed ( @xmath80 ) redshift distribution from the observations .",
    "the purpose of the smoothing is to remove possible redshift clustering in the random sample but still preserve the effect of the selection function .",
    "we tested different smoothing scales @xmath81 and found the resulting correlation function effectively unchanged .",
    "we calculate the redshift - space correlation function in the clasxs sample for non - stellar sources with @xmath82 and 28  kev fluxes @xmath83 , assuming constant clustering in comoving coordinates .",
    "the total number of sources in the sample is 233 .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is 1.2 .",
    "by comparing the number of detected pairs with separations @xmath84  mpc with that expected by simulation , we found that on scales of 20  mpc , the significance of clustering is @xmath85 .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method in searching for the best - fit parameters ( cash 1979 ; popowski et  al .",
    "1998 ; mullis et  al .",
    "the method is preferable to the commonly used @xmath86 method because it is less affected by arbitrary binning .",
    "the method uses very small bins so that each bin contains only 1 or 0 dd pair . in this limit",
    ", the probability associated with each bin is close to independent .",
    "the expected number of dd pairs in each bin is calculated using the dr , rr pairs using the mock catalog .",
    "the likelihood is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the expected number of pairs in each bin and @xmath89 is the observed number of pairs . the likelihood ratio defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the maximum likelihood .",
    "the resulting @xmath92 approaches the usual @xmath86 distribution . since the maximum - likelihood does not provide a measure of the `` goodness - of - fit '' , we quote the @xmath93 derived from the binned correlation function ( as shown in the figures ) and the best - fit parameters from maximum - likelihood estimates .",
    "we fit the correlation functions over three separation ranges . in figure  [ clasxs_cor ]",
    "we show the correlation function and the best - fit with 3  mpc@xmath7200  mpc .",
    "the best - fit parameters for all three separation ranges are listed in table  [ z_space_cor ] .",
    "it is noticeable that the rather large @xmath93 seems to suggest that the single power - law model may not be a proper description of the data .    for comparison",
    ", we also computed the correlation function of the x - ray sources in cdfn in the same redshift interval .",
    "we created a mock catalog 50 times larger than the observation .",
    "the positions and redshifts of the random sources are generated by randomizing the observed positions and redshifts .",
    "a large poisson noise was added to avoid artificial clustering in the mock catalog .",
    "such randomization is justified because the clustering signal in a small field like the cdfn mainly comes from clustering along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the randomized sky coordinates are filtered using an image mask to take into account the edge effects .",
    "we include all the non - stellar sources in the same redshift interval as we use for clasxs , which results in 252 sources in the sample .",

    "is shown in figure  [ cdfn_cor ] .",
    "there is a good agreement of the correlation lengths obtained in the two fields .",
    "there seems to be a systematic flattening of the slope at small separations ( @xmath94  mpc ) in both samples .",

    "the correlation length appears to be higher than that of the cdfn , but agrees within the errors .",
    "the slope also seems steeper than that of the cdfn and agrees better with the slope of the redshift - space correlation function at @xmath107  mpc . since the clasxs sample does not cover separations @xmath108  mpc very well , it is hard to see a slope change in this sample alone . since the cdfn and clasxs connect very well at separations where both surveys are sensitive , we try to model the combined data points with a single power - law .",
    "this yields @xmath109  mpc , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the reduced @xmath93 is much worse than the two samples fitted separately , but does not reject the hypothesis of a single power - law fit .",

    "such a trend need to be looked more closely with future large agn surveys with better signal - to - noise .",
    "redshift distortion affects the correlation function ( power - spectrum ) by increasing the redshift - space correlation amplitude and changing the shape of the 2-d redshift - space correlation function at small scales ( such as the well known `` finger - of - god '' effect , e.g. hamilton 1992 ) .",

    "the choice of this scale is justified given that the slope possibly changes below and above 10  mpc , as seen in the projected correlation function .",
    "since the slope of the redshift- and real - space correlation function is very similar in the cdfn , the ratio is almost constant .",

    "the x - ray samples , however , show a similar correlation amplitude as that of the 2df sample . this is consistent with the weak correlation between agn luminosity and the clustering amplitude found in this work .",
    "we estimate the evolution of bias by comparing the observed clustering amplitude with expectations of the linear evolution of density fluctuations .",
    "the result show that the bias increases rapidly with redshift ( @xmath238 and @xmath239 in clasxs field ) .",
    "this agrees with the findings from 2df .",
    "using the bias evolution model for dark halos from sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) , we estimated the characteristic mass of agns in each redshift interval .",
    "we found the mass of the dark halo changes very little with redshift .",
    "the average halo mass is found to be @xmath240 .",
    "our results have demonstrated that deep x - ray surveys are a very useful tool in studying how agns trace the large scale structure .",
    "such knowledge provides an unique window to the understanding of agn activity , and its relation to structure formation .",
    "the higher spatial density and much better completeness compared to current optical surveys allows us to study clustering on scales only accessible to very large optical surveys such as the 2df and the sdss .",
    "the high spatial resolution and positional accuracy of _ chandra _ is critical for unambiguous optical identifications .",
