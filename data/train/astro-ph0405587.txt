    "@xmath0 car and the associated clusters tr 16 and tr 14 , contain some of the youngest and most massive stars in the galaxy .",
    "these stars presumably trace a sequence in descending order of mass from the enigmatic @xmath0 car , the wolf - rayet star hd 93162 , the o3if ( presumed wolf - rayet precursor ) hd 93129ab , hd 93250 ( o3 v ) , and on through other main sequence stars .",
    "an early chandra image was centered on @xmath0 car , and contained tr 16 and part of tr 14 .",
    "@xmath0 car itself from this image has been discussed by seward et al .",
    "the luminosities and hardness ratios of other stars in the clusters have been discussed by evans et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "source variability will be discussed in a future ( in preparation . )",
    "the chandra acis image provides low resolution spectra of sufficiently luminous sources .",
    "this paper is a discussion of the spectral properties of these stars .",
    "the low resolution spectra supplement grating spectra which can only be obtained for the very brightest x - ray sources .",
    "hetg spectra have been obtained for @xmath0 car itself ( e.g. corcoran et al , 2001 ) .",
    "a major aim of x - ray studies of this region is to understand the factors that dominate the evolution of the most massive stars in the galaxy .",
    "the large number of o stars in this part of the sky justifies the use of less than optimal chandra data ( see section 2 ) . since the surprising discovery of x - rays in o stars with the einstein satellite ( see paper i for background ) , it has been known that at least in some cases , x - ray emission originates in shocks in the strong winds produced by very massive stars .",
    "as shown by macfarlane et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , a stellar wind distribution of shocks is expected to produce a unique x - ray emission line signature of very broad , highly asymmetric , blue- shifted x - ray emission line profiles .",
    "although chandra hetgs observations do show the expected broadness , the emission lines are found to be essentially symmetric and unshifted ( waldron and cassinelli 2001 ; miller et al .",
    "the one exception is the early o - star @xmath1 pup",
    "( cassinelli et al . 2001 ) which shows blue - shifted lines , but the predicted large line asymmetry is minimal .",
    "the picture may be further complicated by the possibility that in some cases a binary system may contain two massive stars giving rise to `` colliding wind '' systems .",
    "recent investigations ( eg schulz et al .",
    "2003 ) add a further complication in that some hot stars appear to produce x - rays through magnetic processes ( eg .",
    "@xmath2 ori c , a , and e ) .",
    "tr 14 and tr 16 therefore provide one of the best locations to investigate x - ray production in a broad range of massive stars .",
    "general introduction to the clusters tr 14 and tr 16 is provided in paper i. since that paper was submitted , two additional studies on the area have become available which are particularly relevant to our discussion .",
    "raassen et al ( 2003 ) have analyzed an xmm - newton high - resolution spectrum of wr 25 .",
    "albacete et al ( 2003 ) have discussed the luminosities and low - resolution spectra of other sources in the region , also using xmm - newton data .",
    "we will include these papers in our discussion later in this paper .",
    "x - rays are particularly good tracers of activity high in the atmospheres of stars . in high mass young stars ,",
    "the mass loss from the atmosphere is fundamental to the future evolution of these objects .",
    "it is also linked to the dynamical and chemical history of the interstellar medium . in this paper ( paper ii ) , we focus on the information that acis - ccd low - resolution spectra provide .",
    "we are investigating three areas in particular .",
    "first , what insights can the spectra provide to the factors effecting evolution of the most massive sequence of objects ( @xmath0 car , hd 93129ab , wr 25 , and hd 93250 ) ?",
    "second , how are the x - ray spectra and intrinsic photospheric stellar parameters ( such as temperature ) or extrinsic parameters ( such as reddening ) related for the o main sequence stars from o3 through o8 ?",
    "finally , what are the characteristics of the x - ray spectra for the cool ( less massive ) , presumably pre - main sequence stars ?  cool stars \" refers to the photospheric temperature of low mass stars , even though their x - ray temperatures are often higher than those of high mass stars .",
    "specifically , our analysis consists of fitting the spectra to multi - component models ( where the spectra have enough counts ) , fitting simpler ciao / sherpa models to weaker spectra , intercomparing the spectra themselves in appropriate subgroups , and comparing derived temperatures and hardness ratios .",
    "succeeding sections of this paper discuss the following topics .",
    "1 . the sources are identified .",
    "strong sources are modeled with a detailed wind model .",
    "3 . weaker sources are fit with models available in the ciao sherpa package .",
    "4 . spectra of sources are intercompared .",
    "information which can be obtained from acis low resolution spectra is discussed .",
    "results are summarized .",
    "@xmath0 car was imaged using the acis - i detector onboard chandra ( garmire et al .",
    "two observations were obtained ( obsid s 50 and 1249 ) within the space of 1.2 days .",
    "there data were merged by reprojecting all the events into a single reference frame .",
    "spectra were extracted for sources with a reasonable number of counts , more than 100 if possible .",
    "background subtraction was handled by extracting counts in an annulus surrounding each source to account for local variations in the diffuse x - ray emission . any contamination from point sources intruding on the background annulus",
    "was eliminated before extracting the background . in a few cases",
    ", we went below our 100-count limit .",
    "for example , weaker sources were used for cool stars to obtain representative examples of the class .",
    "the stars with extracted spectra are indicated on our chandra image shown in fig 1 . to avoid confusion , sources m",
    "and n have not been marked .",
    "they are the two sources immediately south of source h. the sources are listed in table 1 ( ordered by decreasing optical brightness ) , which lists the alphabetical identification in fig 1 .",
    "successive columns are the alphabetical identification , the star name , the source number from paper 1 , ra ( 2000 ) , dec(2000 ) , the counts , two hardness ratios defined below ( hr@xmath3 , the soft hardness ratio and its error , and hr@xmath4 , the hard hardness ratio and its error ) , the v magnitude , the spectral type and the e(b - v ) .",
    "these quantities are taken from paper i , with the final 3 columns generally adopted from massey and johnson ( 1993 , referred to as mj93 below ) .",
    "hardness ratios are formed from counts in bands 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev , and 1.5 to 2.04 kev .",
    "hd 93129ab is a particularly complicated source ( unresolved in our image ) .",
    "the a and b components have spectral types o2if * and o3.5 v((f+ ) ) respectively ( walborn , et al .",
    "in addition , component a was recently resolved by nelan and collaborators ( paper i ; benaglia and koribalski 2004 ) , resulting in an additional component 0.9 mag fainter than a.    the acis detector suffered radiation damage immediately after the opening of the outer doors that protected the instrument during launch .",
    "the radiation damage increased the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) of the acis ccds with the effect of creating a gain shift to lower energies as well as a reduction of the spectral resolution .",
    "these effects are a function of the distance from the original location of the charge ( event ) to the ccd readout node .",
    "the effect is non - linear ( townsley , et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the observation of @xmath5 car occurred near the middle of the maximal change in cti .",
    "furthermore , the operating temperature of acis during this time was -100@xmath6 c , a temperature for which minimal calibration data exist .",
    "as a result , spectral fits may be uncertain which we explore in some detail .",
    "we judge the possible cti - induced differences between the two obsid s to be smaller than the uncertainties in the calibration .",
    "we reach this judgment solely because the observations were contiguous in time .",
    "we approximated an instrument response matrix by interpolating between a matrix at -90@xmath6 c and one at -110@xmath6 c , and introduced a correction for cti as described below , however , the data we used in this analysis do not include these corrections because they were not obtained at that temperature . ] .",
    "we can quantify the impact of cti using three bright stars in the @xmath0 car field ( sources d , e , and f ) .",
    "we extracted the spectra of these sources and found one consistent feature across the spectra : an apparent absorption line near 2.1 kev .",
    "the line is an absorption feature in the iridium coating on the mirror , so it is intrinsic to the instrument and is impressed upon all the spectra .",
    "the limitation in this approach is the presence of only one bright source ( d ) ; sources e and f are weaker .",
    "we modeled the absorption as a gaussian on a sloping background .",
    "the fits yielded the line center and line width and are shown in fig .",
    "the top sub - plot shows the three fits overlaid ; it is clear that a gain shift progression occurs from source f to source e , with the minimum of the absorption moving to lower energies .",
    "the gaussian width becomes larger in the same direction .",
    "3 summarizes the fit parameters , now as a function of the number of pixels from the mean position of the source to the readout node measured along a readout column . the local gain shift and decreased spectral resolution resulting from cti are apparent .",
    "local effects of cti may be corrected by the use of individual response matrices .",
    "all spectral models included a global gain shift with a linear slope of 0.95 and an offset of 0.0 .",
    "these values were taken from the analysis of seward et al .",
    "on @xmath5 car itself also using the 2.1 kev iridium feature .",
    "@xmath5 car is a much brighter source with better count statistics , so the global shift determination , obtained by requiring the iridium feature to lie at its laboratory energy , is accurate .",
    "these values were used during the spectral fits to the sources described here and fixed at the values listed above .",
    "we estimate that the combination of global plus local gain shifts reduces the error on the gain to about 10% or less .",
    "response matrices and effective area files were then generated for each source in table 1 individually .",
    "for the generally low count rates of these ob stars , this approach to calibration provides spectral parameters we estimate are accurate to better than 25% .",
    "the largest discrepancies will occur at the lower energies ; the high column toward the ob stars near @xmath0 car largely eliminate the soft events , however .    to confirm this approach ,",
    "we have compared the fits to our spectra with fits to the same sources in an xmm observation ( albacete colombo , et al . , 2003 ) in table 6 . as discussed in section 6.1",
    ", we find the fits differ in some cases because xmm constrains the extinction better because of its softer response .",
    "when the fits produce the same column density , the luminosities are also similar .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to use zero order data from several hetg spectra to confirm our analysis",
    ". only one of the strong sources falls on the bi acis - s ccd chip , and the relatively few counts would not be a good test of our correction .",
    "chandra hetgs observations have finally verified that the x - ray emission from o stars arise from various regions distributed throughout their stellar winds ( e.g. , waldron and cassinelli 2001 ) which implies that all x - ray spectral model fitting efforts must incorporate the effects of stellar wind absorption . the first attempts to explore wind absorption effects",
    "were carried out during the einstein era ( e.g. , cassinelli and olson 1979 ; waldron 1984 ) . in these studies",
    "it was shown that although the wind absorption cross sections are significantly smaller than the cold ism absorption cross sections below 1 kev , since the wind column densities can be significantly larger than the observed ism column densities , the overall observed x - ray spectral distribution is predominately controlled by the absorption properties of these stellar winds .",
    "even when the ism column density is comparable to the wind column density , the effects of wind absorption still play an important role in the interpretation of observed x - ray spectra ( e.g. , waldron et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the stellar effective temperature ( strength of the uv radiation field ) is the dominant factor that determines the energy distribution of the wind absorption cross sections .",
    "these cross sections are also affected by the density distribution of the wind but these effects are most noticeable only at energies below @xmath7 0.1 kev . in the acis - i energy band ( @xmath8 0.1 kev )",
    "the effects of density are minimal . for our stars with the greatest number of counts ( hd93129ab , hd93250 , and hd93162 ) , effective temperature range between @xmath7 50000 to 54000 k ( howarth and prinja 1989 ; lamers and leitherer 1993 ) , so their wind cross sections are very similar .",
    "figure 4 shows a comparison of the wind cross sections with the ism cross sections for these stars .",
    "since the wind is subjected to a strong uv radiation field , the dominant h and he absorption cross sections seen in ism cross sections are greatly reduced revealing a highly structured collection of wind cross sections below 1 kev from lower abundant elements ( e.g. , cno ) .",
    "for example , the energy shift of the o k - shell edge illustrates that the wind is in a higher state of ionization which leads to the commonly used phrase `` warm - wind '' absorber model .",
    "a slight difference exists between in our fig 4 and waldron et al .",
    "( fig 2 ) because fig 4 is based on an effective temperature of @xmath7 52,000 whereas , the waldron et al plot is based on an effective temperature of 40,000 .    following the wind absorption x - ray fitting procedure outlined by waldron et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we obtain wind absorption model fits to our three acis - i spectra using the mekal emissivity model ( of mewe , kaastra , and liedahl ) .",
    "the ism column densities are fixed parameters in our model fits .",
    "the adopted values are given in table 2 and were determined from their e(b - v ) values given in table 1 as described in shull and van steenberg ( 1985 ) .",
    "( the fits in sections 3 and 4 are made for spectra merged between two 10 ksec images . )",
    "we start by assuming a single component model and add components where necessary to obtain statistically better fits .",
    "all single component fits were clearly not able to explain the spectral distributions .",
    "one star ( hd93250 = source e ) only required two components , whereas , the other two ( hd 93129ab = source f and hd 93162 = source d ) required three components .",
    "the fitting parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "these fits include the cti correction as determined in sec",
    ". 2 . to handle this calibration issue we developed a special algorithm to apply artificial broadening and energy shifts to all lines .",
    "the algorithm extracts the line energy and strength from the input emissivity . each line",
    "is then characterized by a gaussian line profile with the appropriate line broadening ( hwhm in table 2 ) and energy shift .",
    "this modified emissivity is then folded through the acis - i rmf and arf to obtain our best fit models .",
    "we point out that this initial approximate approach to address the calibration problems assumes that all lines are subjected to the same broadening and shifts .",
    "in addition , the continuum and cross section energies are not shifted , which does not appear to be an important effect . although the broadening and shifts do tend to improve the @xmath9 , from a statistical point of view the difference is essentially minimal .",
    "however , a visual inspection of the resultant best - fit spectra clearly show that broadening and shifts indicate better fits to spectra .",
    "the following provides additional information about the parameters in table 2 . for the variables",
    "t@xmath10 , n@xmath11 , and em , the quoted best - fit values and errors are based on taking the @xmath9 90% confidence range for a given variable and averaging to obtain the best - fit value . the error is then associated with the difference .",
    "all variable upper or lower limits represent the upper or lower limits on the 90% confidence range .",
    "the errors on the observed flux , f@xmath12 , and intrinsic flux , f , for each component are determined by comparing the model predicted counts with the observed counts in specified energy bands . for each star these energy bands are dependent on the location at which each component is expected to provide maximum flux . the relative errors in observed and predicted counts",
    "are then compared to the corresponding observed count statistic error , and the adopted error is the larger of the two .    the results of our fits , shown in figs .",
    "57 , indicate that all three targets show evidence for a hard x - ray component with a temperature @xmath13 10 mk which appears to be deeply embedded within the stellar wind ( with a column density n@xmath11 @xmath8 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "the softer components , based on the derived n@xmath11 , all appear to be distributed farther out in the wind .",
    "although this distribution appears consistent with a shock model , the derived temperature distribution ( increasing inward ) may be a problem for a shock model scenario as discussed by waldron and cassinelli ( 2001 ) .",
    "the remaining sources fall into two groups : a group for which spectral fits are potentially meaningful ( sources b = -59@xmath162600 , c = hd 93205 , and g = hde 303308 ) and a group for which spectral fits yield little more than a temperature _ or _ a column density ( sources i , j , k , m = -59@xmath162635 , and n = hd 93343 ) .",
    "we fit the spectra of the first group with three types of raymond - smith models : all parameters free to vary , freezing the plasma energies of the o stars at 0.4 kev , and freezing the column densities at @xmath17  @xmath15 .",
    "the optical extinction typical of the hot stars corresponds to this column density and represents a minimum extinction where there is no additional circumstellar wind absorption .",
    "the adopted temperature is confirmed by the fit in table 4 to source c , the strongest of the normal o stars .",
    "the fits were carried out using the fitting codes sherpa and xspec .",
    "figure 8 shows the results while table 3 lists the model parameters . in table 3",
    "we include the formal errors from the fits , although intercomparison of the results shows that the actual uncertainties are larger than the formal errors .",
    "we have suppressed the error bars in the upper portion of fig . 8 for legibility .",
    "the lower plot shows the residuals of the fit to the spectrum of source c ; the residuals for sources b and g are similar in vertical range , but contain fewer data points spanning the energy scale .",
    "sources b and g ( o6 v and o3 v respectively ) have nearly identical spectral shapes ( and parameters ) and differ from source c ( o3 v ) in that c shows evidence for emission lines ( table 4 ) .",
    "the lines in c were all fit using zero - width gaussians and are significant at @xmath899.7% for 2 parameters of interest ( line center , line flux ) .",
    "two of the features fit with gaussians ( 0.579 and 0.892 kev ) match strong features seen in grating spectra of hot stars ( e.g. @xmath1 pup , cassinelli , et al . ,",
    "2001 ) ; one of the gaussians ( 0.686 kev ) did not have a match .",
    "thus , the low resolution spectra pick out some emission lines accurately , but not all .",
    "the temperature and absorption for source c in table 3 are not exactly the same at that in table 4 . however ,",
    "when either of the parameters is frozen at a value similar to those in table 4 , a similar combination is produced .",
    "this is a good illustration of the non - uniqueness of the fitting procedure ( even where the @xmath9 can be used to select between fits ) . in table 5",
    "( below ) two temperature fits were made .",
    "for source c , the two temperatures bracket the single temperature in tables 3 and 4 .    for the weakest sources ,",
    "the spectral fits essentially permit only an adjustment of the model normalization and perhaps one additional parameter . within the errors ,",
    "it is largely irrelevant whether one fixes the model temperature and fits the column or vice versa .    as part of our exploration of the information that can be obtained from acis resolution spectra , we have also fit raymond - smith models to the strongest spectra , those fit with the wind - models ( table 5 )",
    ". experience has shown that the absorption needs to constrained in the fits .",
    "because the absorption is reasonably constant throughout the clusters , we have fixed the column density at @xmath70.3@xmath1810@xmath14 @xmath15 as in table 3 . the simplest model combined with this extinction that provides reasonable fits to",
    "the spectra is a two temperature model .",
    "one temperature fits result in poor reduced chi - squared values , as seen in table 3 .",
    "( the errors in table 3 are poisson errors from the solution plus 25% because of the calibration uncertainty added in quadrature . )",
    "table 5 provides fits for the two temperature models for sources c , d , e , and f. the reduced @xmath9 is markedly smaller in the two temperature fit than for a single temperature .",
    "these temperatures will be discussed in conjunction with the physical parameters of the stars .",
    "when we compare the temperatures in table 3 and those in table 5 , several features emerge .",
    "table 3 is partly an exploration of the robustness of the fitting results , to see which values are returned most consistently when different parameters are held constant .",
    "the fit which fixes the absorption in table 3 is the most similar to the fit in table 5 . for these fits ,",
    "the single temperature in table 3 always falls between the two temperatures in table 5 .",
    "furthermore the mean temperature in table 5 and the absorption constrained fit in table 3 order in the same way , c , e , f , and d from the coolest to the hottest .",
    "for the two stars most likely to have significantly more absorption than the interstellar absorption , source d = wr 25 and source f = hd 93129ab , the reduced @xmath9 in table 3 shows a marked increase when the absorption is held to the ism absorption .",
    "an exploration of the spectral information independent of response matrix or calibration issues is justified because of the large number of o stars in the region .",
    "tr 14 and tr 16 contain many massive stars ( including several o3 stars , the hottest spectral types ) .",
    "in addition , ground - based observations have provided extinction measures for these stars . in this section ,",
    "we provide direct comparisons between spectra with a variety of optical parameters .      fig .",
    "9 shows the comparison of the spectra of 3 o3 v stars in the image .",
    "source e = hd 93250 is the most x - ray luminous normal star in the chandra image and we use it as the reference spectrum in the comparisons . in fig 9 , in order to compare spectral slopes , sources c and g have been scaled so that they approximately match source e between 0.8 and 1 kev .",
    "the figure shows that the spectral slope from 0.8 to 2 kev is the same for sources c and g , however , source e is clearly harder .",
    "sources c and g have relatively more counts between 0.5 and 0.8 kev than source e. thus the brightest source in x - rays also has the hardest spectrum . from the optical results , all 3 stars have similar e(b ",
    "v ) ( table 1 ) .",
    "thus the fact that source e has the hardest x - ray spectrum should not be caused by differential absorption , but apparently reflects a different source temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that source e with the hardest spectrum is not known to be a binary ( paper i ) , but the softer source c is a binary , and source g may be a binary .",
    "10 shows the comparison of the standard o3 x - ray spectrum ( source e ; solid line ) with the o3 star ( source l ; squares ) which has a high optical absorption [ e(b  v ) = 0.94 mag , table 1 ] .",
    "source l lies very close to the line of sight of a dust lane , and also very close to the wolf - rayet star hd 93162 .",
    "( source l has been scaled to match source e at high energies to see whether the difference in spectra can be accounted for by extra absorption . )",
    "10 shows that while the spectral slopes of sources e and l match for energies higher than 1 kev , the softer flux from source l is much smaller than that of source e , which is consistent with the higher optical extinction in source l. ( massey and johnson were particularly careful in the spectroscopic observations of the absorbed star because of their surprise at the early spectral type for a comparatively faint star . )",
    "source l is a luminosity class i star , where source e is class v , but the major differences between the spectra seem to be due to different extinction .",
    "note that in table 3 , the column density appropriate to the e(b - v ) is between the standard cluster extinction and that found in a free fit . by inference , the temperature would be between the temperatures for the two solutions , which is comparable to the temperature found for source e and the standard cluster extinction .",
    "this is consistent with the working hypothesis that the sources are a similar temperature , but with a different extinction .",
    "11 shows the comparison of source f ( hd 93129ab ) with the reference spectrum .",
    "source f is the brightest star in the tr 14 - 16 region list of massey and johnson .",
    "it is also the most unusual of the low - resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "11 shows prominent emission lines at the locations of ionized mg , si , and perhaps s. this is in marked contrast to the smooth spectrum of source e at this resolution , which is the second brightest star in the massey and johnson list .",
    "the helium - like mg xi and si xiii lines are the strongest lines in the high - resolution spectra of the o4f star @xmath1 pup in this energy region ( cassinelli , et al . , 2001 ;",
    "kahn , et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "2 , hd 93129ab is a complex source ( though unresolved in our image ) , consisting of components aa , ab , and b. since many of the other massive stars we detected are also multiple systems ( table 8 , paper i ) , the multiple components are not the cause of the unique spectrum in fig . 11 , though binarity may have some affect on the spectral properties",
    ". the unique property of hd 93129aa is that it is the most luminous star in the two clusters after @xmath0 car .",
    "the implication is that the spectral emission is related to the extreme luminosity , presumably coupled with a high mass loss rate and possibly circumstellar material .",
    "12 shows the comparison of the later o stars .",
    "the spectra have not been scaled , so there is a range of count rates . however , the spectra are similar in that they all have soft counts .",
    "counts decrease with energy for energies greater than about 0.8 kev .",
    "10 in paper i shows that there in no indication that l@xmath10/ l@xmath19 is a function of photospheric spectral type .",
    "this is consistent with table 1 in this paper , which is ordered by optical magnitude .",
    "the group of later o stars shows that neither the x - ray counts ( column 6 ) nor the optical spectral types ( column 12 ) is tightly correlated with the optical magnitude .",
    "binarity for this group of x - ray sources ( table 8 , paper i ) is mixed .",
    "source b has no velocity evidence for binary motion , and the evidence for sources p and n needs to be confirmed .",
    "the other three ( o , m , and h ) do show binary motion .",
    "in other words , the level of x - ray strength is not uniquely dependent on optical luminosity , spectral type , or binarity .",
    "the similarity of the x - ray spectra ( fig .",
    "12 ) and l@xmath10/ l@xmath19 show that within the range of optical luminosity , spectral type , and multiplicity , the x - ray production is similar . for the four sources that were fitted with temperatures ( b , h , m , and n , table 3 ) , the constrained fit ( requiring that the absorption be appropriate for the cluster ) found the temperatures for h , m. and n similar within the errors .",
    "source b has a somewhat cooler temperature from the fit .",
    "however , the similarity of the spectra in fig .",
    "12 underscores the fact that care must be taken in interpreting the fits when each bin has relatively few counts .",
    "13a shows the comparison between the reference o3 spectrum ( source e ) and an o6 spectrum ( source b ) , scaled to match near 1 kev .",
    "the slopes for e @xmath13 0.8 kev are similar , however , the o6 star has proportionately more counts than the o3 star at lower energies .",
    "the optical absorption [ e(b  v ) ] for the two stars is similar . in fig . 13b , a second o3 star ( source c )",
    "is compared with the o6 star . in this case , the spectra are virtually identical .",
    "thus , stars with optical spectral type o3 can have different x - ray spectra ( fig . 9 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "stars with optical spectral types o3 and o6 can have identical x - ray spectra ( fig 13b ) .",
    "this is in accord with the hardness ratios in paper i. the three sources with particularly soft hr@xmath3 ( soft hardness ratios ) are sources g ( hde 303308 ) , c ( hd 93205 ) , and b ( -59@xmath162600 ) . hr@xmath3 for source e , on the other hand ,",
    "is harder , which agrees with fig 13a .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to explore how well the hardness ratios reflect the details of the spectra .",
    "for these three sources , we can accurately differentiate between harder spectra ( source e ) and softer spectra ( b and c ) using hardness ratios .",
    "we note , however , that sources e and c do not show orbital motion in their velocities ( table 8 , paper i ) .",
    "source c is a binary ( o3 v + o8 v ) .",
    "does this invalidate the interpretation of the hardness ratios ? in cases where there is a colliding wind , the spectrum of the binary will be different from a non - interacting case , where the composite spectrum is simply the sum of the spectra of the two stars .",
    "because l@xmath10/ l@xmath19 is approximately constant for o stars , in the case of a non - interacting composite spectrum , the x - ray spectrum will be dominated by the brightest star in the optical .",
    "this situation would explain the similarity between the spectra of source b and source c in fig .",
    "14 shows the comparison between source a , an o8.5 star and source h , an o8 star , also shown in fig 12 .",
    "neither spectrum has been scaled and fig .",
    "14 shows that at energies higher than 1 kev , source a has about a factor of two more counts than source h. on the other hand , if source h were scaled to have the same flux as source a for energies greater than 1 kev , source a would have fewer soft counts than source h. this is in keeping with the extra absorption in source a ( table 1 ) .",
    "source h is a multiple system , with components o7 v , o8 v , and o9 v ( which is itself a binary ; albacete colombo , et al .",
    "source a , on the other hand , has no information about radial velocity variation .",
    "12 shows that source h has a spectrum with a slope very similar to other late type stars , so the interpretation in the previous section that for a non - interacting binary system , the spectrum will be dominated by the most luminous star appears to hold . in contrast , the spectrum of source a is both harder and more absorbed than source h ( and the other late o stars in fig .",
    "this would be consistent with additional circumstellar material , possibly a colliding wind system or an interacting binary .",
    "15 shows the comparison between the spectra of the wolf - rayet star wr25 = hd93162 ( source d ) and the o3 standard star ( source e ) .",
    "fig 15a shows both spectra , unscaled ( source d : with error bars ; source e : solid line ) .",
    "the spectra are strikingly similar and uncomplicated .",
    "the dip near 2 kev is an instrumental effect . in fig 15b ,",
    "the wolf - rayet spectrum ( solid line ) has been scaled to emphasize the similarity of the spectra at high energies .",
    "however at low energies , the wolf - rayet star has relatively fewer counts than source e ( dashed line ) , appropriate for the its higher absorption .",
    "in general , wr stars have higher mass loss rates than o stars , which may account for the lower count rate at low energies in the wolf - rayet star .",
    "a major motivation for intercomparing the spectra of various sources in this series of plots is to investigate empirical characteristics of the spectra .",
    "experience with spectral fits to these comparatively low resolution spectra shows that the fits are not unique .",
    "the fit in table 2 for source d with three components actually has a somewhat worse reduced @xmath9 than the simpler two component fit in table 5 .",
    "we have no particular expectation that the wolf - rayet star ( source d ) will have a spectrum similar to the o3 v star ( source e ) , which has a comparatively normal optical spectrum .",
    "( we have no explanation , however , for the higher x - ray temperature of source e than other o3 v stars in fig .",
    "9 , particularly since there is no velocity evidence to support the possibility that source e might be a colliding wind binary . )",
    "the spectral comparison in fig .",
    "15 supports the interpretation that the wolf - rayet star has a higher temperature x - ray component and larger absorption than source e. the fits to source d are discussed further in sec .",
    "6.3 , and compared with the high resolution xmm results of the same source ( raasen , et al .",
    "2003 ) .      despite very different photospheric spectral types of source l ( o3 i ) and source",
    "a ( o8.5 v ) , the x - ray spectra are identical , as shown in fig .",
    "source a is also shown in fig .",
    "14 , which illustrates that it is an absorbed spectrum , confirming a large extinction in the optical .",
    "however , the spectra in fig .",
    "16 are not hard simply because their soft counts have been absorbed ; the count rate at 2 kev and higher show that they are intrinsically hard . in table 3 , most of the solutions listed have constraints either on the temperature of the source or the absorption because of fits are not definitive when too many parameters are included in a fit of weak spectra . for source a ,",
    "when both temperature and absorption are fitted , both are larger than the standard constraints for the cluster . although the temperature in the fit with constrained extinction ( 10.2 k ) is not very hard , it is harder than constrained fits for other o stars in table 1 , except for sources d and f ( and l ) which are more evolved .",
    "fig 17 shows the spectra of three stars ( sources i , j. and k ) which are fainter and cooler than the o star x - ray sources . in paper",
    "i , we overplotted all the o and b stars in the clusters on the x - ray sources .",
    "sources not coinciding with an o or b source are listed as cooler stars in tables 2 and 4 in paper i. sources i , j , and k are clearly among the very strongest of these sources .",
    "they have v magnitudes of 16.82 , 14.34 , and 13.16 mag ( table 1 ) respectively , appropriate for sources cooler than the o stars and fall within the pre - main sequence band .",
    "for comparison , a representative hot star spectrum ( source b , o6 v ) is shown in fig .",
    "all three cool stars have fairly flat spectra . in contrast",
    ", the hot star spectrum has proportionately more soft counts .",
    "this is in accord with previous findings that cool stars produce x - rays through magnetic processes at higher temperatures than the wind shock processes in hot stars .",
    "the goal of this investigation is to explore what physical x - ray parameters can be determined from acis low - resolution spectra .",
    "we have described a particularly useful chandra pointing for this purpose , because the region around @xmath0 car contains a large number of extremely massive stars as well as many low mass stars .",
    "we have investigated the spectra with detailed wind models , with sherpa spectral fits , and with comparisons between spectra .",
    "the first step is to discuss whether the results from these approaches are consistent .    as discussed above",
    ", the spectra of the weak sources do not constrain both the extinction and the source temperature . for the stars in this field ,",
    "the extinction is surprisingly uniform , with e(b - v ) approximately 0.5 mag ( mj93 ) .",
    "the hot stars typically have individually determined reddenings ( e.g. mj93 ) , which corresponds to a hydrogen column density n@xmath20 = 3 x 10@xmath21 @xmath15 ( seward , 2000 ) . table 3 lists a fit for each source for which the ism n@xmath20 has been fixed to this value (  restricted fitting \" ) .",
    "we will examine the temperatures using this fixed n@xmath20 value to see if they are reasonable .",
    "this value of absorption would be the minimum value , assuming there is no absorption in the wind ( the  warm absorber \" ) .",
    "from the temperature fits , we can see that this minimum absorption produces a high temperature . if the absorption is allowed to increase in the fit , the fitted temperature decreases .",
    "we stress that any fit is not unique ; by selecting the restricted fits for discussion , we have imposed a reasonable condition .    the cool stars ( sources i , j , and k ) have harder spectra than the hot stars ( fig .",
    "17 ) . in table 3 , two of the three cool stars , sources i and k , have temperatures of 1.4 and 5.2 kev respectively from this fitting , i.e. well above the standard range for hot stars .",
    "the other two sources for which the standard e(b - v ) is a poor choice are a and l , which we know from the optical results to have e(b - v ) about twice that value .",
    "again this restricted fitting results in temperatures kt of 1.1 and 9.7 kev respectively , larger than the standard range for hot stars .",
    "for the remaining sources , a combination of n@xmath20 ( consistent with optical reddening ) and kt can be found for a raymond - smith plasma that matches the spectrum .",
    "a recent paper by albacete colombo et al ( 2003 ) discusses xmm - newton x - ray observations of many of the same targets as we do .",
    "because our fitting procedures are somewhat different than theirs , the results from temperature fitting ( their table 4 ) will not be identical to ours .",
    "our table 3 presents fits generally restricting either the temperature or the absorption .",
    "similarly , our table 5 presents fits for a few sources with two temperatures but a fixed extinction .",
    "since the foreground extinction is reasonably constant , so we have forced an extinction which is at least a lower limit , rather than allowing what seem to be unphysically large values that sometimes result from allowing the extinction to be a free parameter .",
    "table 6 shows the comparison between the single component fit in table 3 and dominant component in the xmm fit .",
    "clearly , we match the shape of the fitted spectral function ; the differing bandpasses ( xmm goes 0.2 kev softer ) has a significant impact on the precision and value of the fitted column density , particularly for high values of the column density ( sources b , c , d , e ) .",
    "when the two sets of fits yield approximately the same column , we obtain approximately the same luminosity ( sources a , g ) .",
    "remaining luminosity differences are easily attributed to the wider xmm bandpass plus the poorly - calibrated phase during which our data were obtained .    in general",
    ", our analysis of more complex multicomponent fits agrees with that albacete colombo et al ( 2003 ) in identifying sources with unusually hot components , which we will discuss in turn .",
    "for source d = wr25 , both analyses find one component a little above 3 kev and one close to 0.8 kev , although the absorption for the cooler component is larger than our canonical absorption .",
    "for source c = hd 93205 the temperatures in both fits are close to 1.0 kev and 0.2 kev , with approximately the same absorption .",
    "for source e = hd 93250 , the temperatures for both components are hotter than our results ( 5 rather than 3 kev and 0.8 rather than 0.3 kev ) , with similar absorptions .",
    "for source a = cpd -59 2629 , our fig .",
    "14 clearly shows that there is a hot component , and we know extra absorption is present from the optical results .",
    "a hot component is found by albacete colombo et al .",
    ", as one of the components of the fit .",
    "since we only did a one temperature fit , the derived temperature is lower than for the hottest component of their two temperature fit . for source g = hde 303308 , albacete colombo et al",
    ". found temperatures and extinctions which differ markedly for their two components .",
    "for our three fits , we found a single temperature and extinction solution which was fairly close to standard values for the cluster for each .",
    "for source b = cpd -59 2600 , both our constrained fits and the single temperature fit of albacete colombo et al . found temperatures and extinctions close to those typical for the cluster .",
    "direct comparisons of c and g ( fig . 9 ) and c and b ( fig .",
    "13 ) show that all three spectra are very similar , which agrees with similar values from our temperature fits .      in paper",
    "i we derived hardness ratios from 3 energy bands , 0.5 to 0.9 kev , 0.9 to 1.5 kev , and 1.5 to 2.04 kev , referred to as soft ( s ) , medium ( m ) , and hard ( h ) bands .",

    "the stars in fig .",

    "the three strongest sources , however , have much larger temperatures and harder hardness ratios .    fig .",
    "19 shows the temperatures as a function of photospheric spectral type . as in fig .",
    "18 , the weaker sources have a relatively small temperature range , which is not correlated with photospheric spectral type .",
    "on the other hand , the 4 stars with the hottest spectral types ( o3 stars ) divide between relatively cool and much hotter x - ray temperatures . in other words ,",
    "the photospheric temperature alone is not the determinant of the x - ray temperature .",

    "fig 20 shows the x - ray temperature as a function of the v magnitude . for the cluster stars , this is related to the luminosity of the stars , and probably also to the mass loss rate .",
    "the fainter stars ( x s ) show no relation between the x - ray temperature and the mass of the stars .",
    "the x - ray temperatures are markedly larger for the massive stars ( squares ) .",

    "the four unusually strong , hard x - ray sources ( @xmath0 car itself , wr 25 , hd 93129ab and hd 93250 ) are all at the very end of their main sequence lifetimes or beyond . as discussed in sec . 2 above , hd 93129ab",

    "do find that it is not variable in their 43 ksec xmm observation .",
    "in other words they do not see a flare which would be a clue to x - rays produced by a pre - main sequence companion .",
    "if it turns out that magnetic fields play a role for a significant fraction of o stars , it may even be that a close binary companion can suppress a magnetic field , thus actually reducing the x - ray flux .",
    "qualitatively , the comparison of the x - ray spectra of wr 25 , hd 93129ab , and hd 93250 shows dramatic differences .",
    "is the prominence of emission features related simply to evolutionary changes ? certainly decreasing in mass loss rate in this sequence causes the x - ray spectrum to sample different levels of the atmosphere .",
    "the e(b - v ) of wr 25 is larger than for hd 93129ab and hd 93250 , as would be expected from the high mass loss rates of wr stars .",
    "however , the x - ray spectrum of the wolf - rayet star @xmath29 vel provides a cautionary note about a simple interpretation ( skinner , et al . 2001 ; willis et al . 1995 ;",
    "stevens et al . 1996 ) .",

    "( 1995 ) and stevens , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained rosat and asca observations of @xmath29 vel respectively . with the rosat observations , they mapped a dramatic increase in x - ray flux close to the periastron in the 78@xmath30 orbital period .",
    "the asca observations also show a dramatic change in two spectra before and after periastron .",
    "after periastron , the x - ray flux was both larger and harder , and also has emission lines very similar to those seen in hd 93129ab .",
    "this was confirmed by a chandra hetg spectrum at the same phase ( skinner et al .",
    "the proposed explanation is that the large x - ray flux appears when the system is viewed along the shock cone of the colliding wind ( around the o star , which has a weaker wind than the wr star ) . at other phases ,",
    "the extended wr star dominates the spectrum .",
    "thus the `` wind - shock '' phase in @xmath29 vel produces a spectrum much more like the o3 if hd93129ab than wr 25 .",
    "even the spectrum in @xmath29 vel at the phase dominated by the wolf - rayet star is softer than wr 25 . in other words ,",
    "sources may be made up of several components , and it is only the relative importance which changes as the stars evolve .",
    "furthermore , as noted above , emission lines are seen in the xmm spectrum of wr 25 ( raasen , et al 2003 ) .",
    "the addition of a hard component to a spectrum like hd 93129ab could swamp the emission features .    in the previous section we have discussed properties such as binarity and magnetic fields which may mean that the evolutionary development may differ from evolution of a single object . ignoring these complexities ,",
    "we suggest here a simple scenario which relates the changes in the x - ray spectra to evolutionary changes in these very massive stars .",
    "first it is clear that hd 93205 (= source c ) should become a colliding wind binary in the future since it is in a short period ( 6@xmath30 ) orbit with an o8 v star .",
    "however , so far its spectrum resembles cooler o stars , and the x - ray bright o3 v star hd 93250 ( = source e ; e.g. figs 9 and 19 ) .",
    "hd 93250 is more x - ray luminous , as well as more bolometrically luminous .",
    "the mass loss rates of the sequence of o3 stars hd 93205 , hd 93250 , and hd 93129ab (= source f ) are log m = -5.8 , -4.6 , and -4.9",
    "m@xmath31 yr@xmath26 respectively ( howarth and prinja , 1989 ) from iue high resolution spectra .",
    "thus it is likely that the increase in x - ray luminosity from hd 93205 to hd 93250 is related to the increased mass loss in the more luminous , and presumably more massive star .",
    "the o3 if supergiant system hd 93129ab is not only more x - ray luminous , but it also has very broad emission lines .",
    "circumstellar material accumulated from the mass loss of the more evolved primary star in the system could account for the emission , even though the mass loss rate found by howarth and prinja is actually smaller than that for hd 93250 . for hd 93162 = wr 25 = source d , the mass loss rate log m -4.4 m@xmath31 yr@xmath26 ( raasen , et al .",
    "it is an unusually strong x - ray source compared with other wr stars .",
    "the strong hard x - rays , the large mass loss rate , and the large e(b - v ) are all presumably related .",
    "the @xmath29 vel system demonstrates that a wr system can produce broad emission lines , although they are related to the wind - shock cone .",
    "it is not clear whether wr 25 is a binary system , as discussed by raasen et al . , although they find a fe k@xmath27 feature which they suggest signifies a binary system . as suggested above , in our scenario emission lines related to circumstellar material such as those in hd 93129ab",
    "may be dominated by the unusually strong high temperature component in wr 25 .",
    "although this scenario for the four strongest x - ray sources is simplified , it does provide a working model which links the observed features in the x - ray spectra with the underlying evolutionary changes .",
    "among the points found from the spectral comparisons in this study are :    @xmath32 among the hottest ( o3 ) stars with similar photospheric temperatures ( fig .",
    "9 ) , two have identical spectra , but one is significantly harder .",
    "the harder spectrum is produced by the more bolometrically luminous star .",
    "a harder spectrum in a more luminous star may result partly from extra absorption from a larger mass loss in the wind .",
    "however , it also has a higher x - ray flux , which means the difference can not result only from the removal of soft counts .",
    "@xmath32 extra absorption is clearly seen in the spectrum of source l = tr 16 - 244 ( fig .",

    "the x - ray spectra for these stars are all hard , but with dramatic changes , from relatively smooth through prominent emission lines ( hd 93129ab ) back to comparatively smooth for wr 25 .",
    "presumably this results from increasing mass loss driven by evolution .",
