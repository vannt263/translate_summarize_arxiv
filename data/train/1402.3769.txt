    "recognizing the importance of massive galaxy clusters as gravitational telescopes for studies of the distant universe as originally proposed by the clusters as telescopes team ( cats ) , space telescope science institute ( stsci ) recently announced the frontier fields ( ff ) project , a commitment of 560 orbits of _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ time in cycles 21 and 22 to deep observations of four clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath3 ) . each target will be observed with both the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) for 20 orbits in each of the f435w , f606w , f814w , f105w , f125 , f140 , and f160w filters , reaching a limiting magnitude of approximately 29 ( ab system ) across the full optical and near - infrared ( nir ) window .",
    "both acs and wfc3 will be used simultaneously , such that for each cluster target images of equal depth are accumulated of the cluster core and of a flanking parallel field about 6 arcmin away . extending the nir spectral coverage further , 1000 hours of spitzer space telescope time",
    "are being devoted to observations of the same four fields at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m .",
    "the ff project represents the largest investment of _ hst _ time for deep observations of galaxy clusters in the history of _ hst_. its main science goal is the discovery of gravitationally lensed background galaxies at @xmath5 for both in - depth studies of bright individual objects and statistical investigations into the properties of galaxies at magnitudes and distances inaccessible to observation without gravitational amplification . as a bonus , the ff observations will also yield the deepest images of the cores of massive clusters ever collected , thereby facilitating exquisitely detailed characterizations of the cluster lenses and their galaxy content .",
    "the four clusters selected for the ff initiative for cycle 21 and 22 are a2744 ( @xmath6 ) , macsj0416.12403 ( @xmath7 ) , macsj0717.5 + 3745 ( @xmath8 ) , and macsj1149.5 + 2223 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "subject to a review of the observations collected up to then , two additional clusters ( as1063 and a370 ) will be added to the ff sample and observed in cycle 23 .",
    "all ff clusters are exceptionally x - ray luminous systems ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 , bolometric ) and feature pronounced substructure , i.e. , they combine the two characteristics that select the most powerful cluster lenses . additional information on the ff project can be found on http://www.stsci.edu / hst / campaigns / frontier - fields/.",
    "if the scientific potential of the ff project for the characterization of the high - redshift universe is to be fully exploited , the magnification of the cluster lenses and thus their mass distributions must be accurately mapped . within the cluster cores ,",
    "the mass distribution can be derived from carefully identified strong - gravitational lensing features , with the greatest leverage being provided by sets of multiple - image systems .",
    "in addition to cluster - scale halos , the resulting mass models also include appropriately scaled mass halos at the location of the most luminous cluster galaxies , thereby accounting for small - scale perturbations . on larger scales , i.e. , outside the strong - lensing regime , complementary constraints on the mass and magnification maps are obtained from measurements of the weak gravitational shear induced by the cluster lens . for the ff clusters ,",
    "the weak - lensing regime is poorly sampled by the pre - ff , relatively shallow _ hst _ images ; better coverage and thus better constraints on the mass and magnification at larger cluster - centric radii will ultimately emerge from the much deeper ff images themselves ( including those of the flanking fields ) as well as from supporting wide - field imaging .
