    "helical structures in the solar features like sunspot whirls were reported long back by george e. hale in 1925 @xcite .",
    "he found that about 80% of the sunspot whirls were counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere .",
    "later , in 1941 the result was confirmed by richardson @xcite by extending the investigation over four solar cycles .",
    "this hemispheric pattern was found to be independent of the solar cycle . since the 90 s",
    ", the subject has been rejuvenated and this hemispheric behaviour independent of sunspot cycle is claimed to be observed for many of the solar features like active regions @xcite , filaments @xcite , coronal loops @xcite , interplanetary magnetic clouds ( imcs ) @xcite , coronal x - ray arcades @xcite and network magnetic fields @xcite etc .",
    "helicity is a physical quantity that measures the degree of linkages and twistedness in the field lines @xcite .",
    "magnetic helicity h@xmath3 is given by a volume integral over the scalar product of the magnetic field * b * and its vector potential * a * @xcite .",
    "@xmath4    with * * b**= @xmath5 * a*.    it is well known that the vector potential * a * is not unique , thereby preventing the calculation of a unique value for the magnetic helicity from the equation ( 1 ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the helicity of magnetic field can best be characterized by the force - free parameter @xmath0 , also known as the helicity parameter or twist parameter .",
    "the force - free condition @xcite is given as , @xmath6 alpha is a measure of degree of twist per unit axial length ( see appendix - a for details of physical meaning of alpha ) .",
    "this is a local parameter which can vary across the field but is constant along the field lines .",
    "researchers have claimed to have determined the sign of magnetic helicity on the photosphere by calculating alpha , e.g. @xmath7 @xcite , averaged alpha e.g. @xmath8 = @xmath9 @xcite with current density @xmath10 .",
    "some authors have used current helicity density @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a good correlation was found between @xmath7 and @xmath13 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but the sign of magnetic helicity can not be inferred from the force - free parameter @xmath0 under all conditions ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is well known that the reliable measurements of vector magnetic fields are needed to study various important parameters like electric currents in the active regions , magnetic energy dissipation during flares , field geometry of sunspots , magnetic twist etc .",
    "the study of error propagation from polarization measurements to vector field parameters is very important @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied the effects of realistic errors e.g. , due to random polarization noise , crosstalk between different polarization signals , systematic polarization bias and seeing induced crosstalk etc . on known magnetic fields .",
    "they derived analytical expressions for how these errors produce errors in the estimation of magnetic energy ( calculated from virial theorem ) .",
    "however , they simulated these effects for magnetographs which sample polarization at few fixed wavelength positions in line wings .",
    "it is well known that such observations lead to systematic under - estimation of field strength and also suffer from magneto - optical effects @xcite .",
    "whereas in our analysis , we simulate the effect of polarimetric noise on field parameters as deduced by full stokes inversion .",
    "the details are discussed in the section 6 .",
    "@xcite found large variations in the global @xmath0 values from repeated observations of the same active regions .",
    "it is important to model the measurement uncertainties before looking for physical explanations for such a scatter .    in a study by @xcite the noise levels in the observed fields",
    "were analyzed , but a quantitative relationship between the uncertainties in fields and the uncertainties in global @xmath0 value were not established .",
    "they could only determine the extent to which the incremental introduction of noise affects the observed value of alpha .",
    "however , for the proper tracking of error propagation , we need to start with ideal data devoid of noise and with known values of @xmath0 and magnetic energy .",
    "we follow the latter approach in our present analysis .    here , we estimate the accuracy in the calculation of the @xmath0 parameter and the magnetic energy due to different noise levels in the spectro - polarimetric profiles .",
    "modern instruments measure the full stokes polarization parameters within the line profile .",
    "basically there are two types of spectro - polarimeters : ( i ) spectrograph based e.g. , advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp : @xcite ) , zurich imaging polarimeter ( zimpol : @xcite ) , themis - mtr ( @xcite ) , solis - vector spectro - magnetograph ( vsm : @xcite ) , polarimetric littrow spectrograph ( polis : @xcite ) , diffraction limited spectro - polarimeter ( dlsp : @xcite ) , hinode ( sot / sp : @xcite ) , etc . and ( ii ) filter - based e.g. , imaging vector magnetograph ( ivm ) at mees solar observatory , hawaii @xcite , solar vector magnetograph at udaipur solar observatory ( svm - uso)@xcite etc .",
    "earlier magnetographs like crimea @xcite , msfc @xcite , hsp @xcite , oao @xcite , hsos @xcite , potsdam vector magnetograph @xcite , sft @xcite etc . were mostly based on polarization measurements at a few wavelength positions in the line wings and hence subject to zeeman saturation effects as well as magneto - optical effects like faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field vector deduced from stokes profiles by modern techniques are almost free from such effects @xcite .",
    "this paper serves three purposes .",
    "first , we estimate the error in the calculation of field strength , inclination and azimuth and thereafter in the calculation of the vector field components @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "second , we estimate the error in the determination of global @xmath0 due to noise in polarimetric profiles constructed from the analytical vector field data .",
    "third , we estimate the error in the calculation of magnetic energy derived using virial theorem , due to polarimetric noise .    in the next section ( section 2 )",
    "we discuss a direct method for calculation of a single global @xmath0 for an active region . in section 3 , we describe the method of simulating an analytical bipole field .",
    "section 4 contains the analysis and the results .",
    "error estimation in global @xmath0 is given in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we discuss the process of estimating the error in the virial magnetic energy .",
    "section 7 deals with discussion and conclusions .",
    "taking the z - component of magnetic field , from the force - free field equation ( 2 ) @xmath0 can be written as , @xmath17 for a least squares minimization , we should have @xmath18    where @xmath0 is the local value at each pixel , @xmath19 is the global value of @xmath0 for the complete active region and n is total number of pixels .",
    "+ since eqn.(4 ) will lead to singularities at the neutral lines where b@xmath20 approaches 0 , therefore the next moment of minimization , @xmath21 should be used . from eqn.(5 ) we have @xmath22 which leads to the following result , @xmath23 this formula gives a single global value of @xmath0 in a sunspot and is the same as @xmath24 of @xcite .",
    "we prefer this direct way of obtaining global @xmath0 which is different from the method discussed in @xcite for determining @xmath7 .",
    "the main differences are : ( 1 ) .",
    "the singularities at neutral line are automatically avoided in our method by using the second moment of minimization and ( 2 ) .",
    "the computation of constant @xmath0 force - free fields for different test values of @xmath0 is not required .",
    "@xcite used a different parameter @xmath25 to avoid the effect of faraday rotation in sunspot umbrae .",
    "however , modern inversion techniques using complete stokes profiles are free of this problem .",
    "it must be noted that one can generate different values of @xmath19 using higher moments of minimization , e.g. , by weighting @xmath26 with @xmath27 , with n=3 , 5 , 7 , ... etc .",
    "the higher moments will be more sensitive to spatial variation of @xmath28 .",
    "such large and complex variation of @xmath28 is found generally in flare productive active regions @xcite .",
    "thus we can try to use higher order @xmath19 as a global index for predicting the flare productivity in active regions .",
    "finally , to compute @xmath19 we need all the three components of magnetic field which is obtained from the measurements of vector magnetograms .",
    "however , here we use the analytically generated bipole , as discussed in the following section , with known values of all the magnetic parameters to investigate the effect of polarimetric noise .",
    "we use the analytic , non - potential force - free fields of the form derived by @xcite .",
    "these fields describe an isolated bipolar magnetic region which is obtained by introducing currents into a potential field structure .",
    "this potential field is produced by an infinite straight line current running along the intersection of the planes y = 0 and z = -a , where negative sign denotes planes below the photosphere z = 0 . at the photosphere ( z = 0 )",
    ", the field has the following form : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the magnitude of the field at origin and @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath34 is a free generating function related to the force - free parameter @xmath0 ( see eqn ( 2 ) ) by @xmath35 which determines the current structure and hence the amount and location of shear present in the region .",
    "by choosing @xmath36 we can obtain a simple potential ( current - free , @xmath37 ) field produced by the infinite line current lying outside the domain .",
    "steeper gradient of @xmath34 results in a more sheared ( non - potential ) field .    in equation",
    "( 11 ) the sign on the right hand side is taken positive in the paper by low ( 1982 ) which is a typing mistake ( confirmed by b. c. low , private communication ) .",
    "we mention this here to avoid carrying forward of this typo as was done in @xcite .    a grid of 100 x 100 pixels was selected for calculating the field components .",
    "the magnitude of field strength at origin has been taken as 1000 g and the value of ` a ' is taken as 15 pixels ( below the photosphere , z = 0 ) .",
    "the simulated field components with corresponding contours are shown in the figure 1 .",
    "here we use the following function ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the generation of the field components ( b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 , b@xmath20 ) : @xmath40 results for the fields generated by different @xmath34 are quantitatively similar . in this way we generate a set of vector fields with known values of @xmath0 .    most of the time one of the bipoles of a sunspot observed on the sun is compact ( leading ) and the other ( following ) is comparatively diffuse .",
    "observations of compact pole gives half of the total flux of the sunspot and is mostly used for analysis .",
    "one can derive the twist present in the sunspot using one compact pole of the bipolar sunspot for constant @xmath0 .",
    "thus we have selected a single polarity of the analytical bipole as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] to calculate the twist .",
    "fine structure in real sunspots is difficult to model .",
    "our analysis applies to the large scale patterns of the magnetic field regardless of fine structure .",
    "all the following sections discuss the analysis and results obtained .",
    "using the analytical bipole method @xcite the non - potential force - free field components b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 & b@xmath20 in a plane have been generated and are given as in equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) & ( 10 ) .",
    "we have shown b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 , & b@xmath20 maps ( generated on a grid of 100 x 100 pixels ) in figure  [ fig1 ] . from these components",
    "we have derived magnetic field strength ( b ) , inclination ( @xmath41 ) and azimuth ( @xmath42 : free from 180@xmath43 ambiguity ) . in order to simulate the effect of typical polarimetric noise in actual solar observations on magnetic field measurements and study the error in the calculation of @xmath0 and magnetic energy , we have generated the synthetic stokes profiles for each b , @xmath41 and @xmath42 in a grid of 100 x 100 pixels , using the he - line information extractor `` helix '' code @xcite .",
    "this code is a stokes inversion code based on fitting the observed stokes profiles with synthetic ones obtained by unno - rachkovsky solutions @xcite to the polarized radiative transfer equations ( rte ) under the assumption of milne - eddington ( me ) atmosphere @xcite and local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "however , one can also use this code for generating synthetic stokes profiles for an input model atmosphere .",
    "the synthetic profiles are functions of magnetic field strength ( b ) , inclination ( @xmath41 ) , azimuth ( @xmath42 ) , line of sight velocity ( @xmath44 ) , doppler width ( @xmath45 ) , damping constant ( @xmath46 ) , ratio of the center to continuum opacity ( @xmath47 ) , slope of the source function ( @xmath48 ) and the source function ( @xmath49 ) at @xmath50 = 0 .",
    "the filling factor is taken as unity . in our profile synthesis",
    "only magnetic field parameters b , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are varied while other model parameters are kept same for all pixels .",
    "the typical values of other thermodynamical parameters are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we use the same parameters for all pixels .",
    "further , all the physical parameters at each pixel are taken to be constant in the line forming region .",
    "however , one must remember that real solar observations have often stokes v area asymmetries @xcite as a result of vertical magnetic and velocity field gradients present in the line forming region .",
    "this has not been taken into account in our simulations .",
    "a set of stokes profiles with 0.5% and 2.0% noise for a pixel is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "+    the wavelength grid used for generating synthetic spectral profiles is same as that of hinode ( sot / sp ) data which are as follows : start wavelength of 6300.89  , spectral sampling 21.5 m / pixel , and 112 spectral samples .",
    "we add normally distributed random noise of different levels in the synthetic stokes profiles .",
    "typical noise levels in stokes profiles obtained by hinode ( sot / sp ) normal mode scan are of the order of 10@xmath1 of the continuum intensity , i@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we add random noise of 0.5 % of the continuum intensity i@xmath2 to the polarimetric profiles .",
    "in addition , we also study the effect of adding a noise of 2.0% level to stokes profiles as a worst case scenario .",
    "we add 100 realizations of the noise of the orders mentioned above to each pixel and invert the corresponding 100 noisy profiles using the `` helix '' code .",
    "the guess parameters to initialize the inversion are generated by perturbing known values of b , @xmath41 and @xmath42 by 10% .",
    "thus after inverting 100 times we get 100 sets of b , @xmath41 & @xmath42 maps for the input b , @xmath41 & @xmath42 values from bipole data . in this way we estimate the spread in the derived field values for various field strengths , inclinations etc .",
    "first , the inversion is done without adding any noise in the profiles to check the accuracy of inversion process .",
    "we get the results retrieved in this process which are very similar to that of the initial analytical ones .",
    "the scatter plot of input field strength , inclination , azimuth against the corresponding retrieved strength , inclination , azimuth after noise addition and inversion is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "typical b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 & b@xmath20 maps with different noise levels are shown in the lower panel . as the noise increases b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 & b@xmath20",
    "maps become more grainy .    from the plots shown in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we can see that the error in the field strength for a given noise level decreases for strong fields .",
    "this is similar to results of @xcite .",
    "as the noise increases in the profiles , error in deriving the field strength increases .",
    "we find that the error in the field strength determination is @xmath51 for 0.5% noise and @xmath52 for 2% noise in the profiles .",
    "inclination shows more noise near 0@xmath43 & 180@xmath43 than at @xmath53 . the error is less even for large noisy profiles for the inclination angles between @xmath54 .",
    "the reason for this may be understood in the following way .",
    "linear polarization is weaker near 0 and 180@xmath43 inclinations and is therefore more affected by the noise .",
    "the azimuth determination has inherent 180@xmath43 ambiguity due to insensitivity of zeeman effect to orientation of transverse fields .",
    "thus in order to compare the input and output azimuths we resolve this ambiguity in @xmath55 by comparing it with @xmath56 i.e. , the value of @xmath55 which makes acute angle with @xmath56 has been taken as correct .",
    "we can see azimuth values after resolving the ambiguity in this way show good correlation with input azimuth values .",
    "some scatter is due to the points where ambiguity was not resolved due to 90@xmath43 difference in @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "first , the @xmath19 was calculated from the vector field components derived from the noise free profiles to verify the method of calculating global alpha and also the inversion process .",
    "we have used the single polarity to calculate global alpha present in sunspot as discussed in section 3 .",
    "we retrieved the same value of @xmath19 as calculated using the initial analytical field components . from the figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we can see that the effect of noise on the field components is not much for the case of 0.5% noise but as the noise in the profiles is increased to 2.0% , the field components specially transverse fields show more uncertainty .",
    "the vertical field is comparatively less affected with noise . the scatter plot in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "shows that the inversion gives good correlation to the actual field values .",
    "the points with large scatter are due to poor `` signal to noise '' ratio in the simulated profiles .",
    "the mean percentage error in the further discussions is given in terms of weighted average of error .",
    "we calculate the percentage error in global alpha each time after getting the inverted results , for both the cases when 0.5% and 2.0% ( of i@xmath57 ) noise is added in the profiles , by the following relation :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is calculated global alpha and @xmath19 is the analytical global alpha .",
    "the histogram of the results obtained is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "first , we inverted the profiles without adding any noise and calculated @xmath19 from retrieved results to compare it with the ` true ' @xmath19 calculated from the analytically generated vector field components .",
    "we get less than 0.002% difference in the both @xmath19 values .    for the case of 0.5% noise in polarimetric profiles we get a mean error of 0.3% in the calculation of @xmath19 and error",
    "is never more than 1% .",
    "thus the calculation of @xmath19 is almost free from the effect of noise in this case .",
    "hence , by using data from hinode ( sot / sp ) , one can derive the accurate value of twist present in a sunspot .",
    "if 2.0% noise is present in the polarization , then maximum @xmath60 error is obtained .",
    "weighted average shows only 1% error .",
    "thus the estimation of alpha is not influenced very much even from the data obtained with old and ground based magnetographs . in any event it is unlikely that a realistic error will be large enough to create a change in the sign of @xmath61 .",
    "the magnetic energy has been calculated using virial theorem .",
    "one form of the general virial theorem @xcite states that for a force - free magnetic field , the magnetic energy contained in a volume v is given by a surface integral over the boundary surface s , @xmath62\\cdot { \\bf \\hat{n}}\\ \\ ds\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the position vector relative to an arbitrary origin , and n is the normal vector at surface .",
    "let us adopt cartesian coordinates , taking as z=0 plane for photosphere .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because the size of sunspots are very small compared to the radius of the sun .",
    "if we make the further reasonable assumption that the magnetic field strength decreases with distance more rapidly than r@xmath64 whereas a point dipole field falls off as r@xmath1 , then the equation ( 15 ) can be simplified to @xcite @xmath65 where x and y are the horizontal spatial coordinates .",
    "b@xmath38 , b@xmath39 & b@xmath20 are the vector magnetic field components .",
    "this equation ( 16 ) is referred as the `` magnetic virial theorem '' .",
    "thus magnetic energy of an active region can be calculated simply by substituting the derived vector field components into the surface integral of equation ( 16 ) @xcite .",
    "magnetic field should be solenoidal and force - free as is the case for our analytical field .",
    "so the energy integral is independent of choice of the origin .",
    "if all the above conditions are satisfied then the remaining source of uncertainty in the magnetic energy estimation is the errors in the vector field measurements themselves .",
    "so , before the virial theorem can be meaningfully applied to the sun , it is necessary first to understand how the errors in the vector field measurements produce errors in the calculated magnetic energies .",
    "earlier , the efforts were made to estimate the errors @xcite for magnetographs like marshall space flight center ( msfc ) magnetograph .",
    "@xcite constructed a potential field from msfc data and computed its virial magnetic energy .",
    "then , they modified the vector field components by introducing random errors in b@xmath66 , b@xmath67 and b@xmath68 and recomputed the energy .",
    "they found the two energies differ by 11% .",
    "@xcite approached the problem differently .",
    "they introduced errors in the polarization measurements from which the field is derived instead of introducing errors to magnetic fields directly . in this way they were able to approximate reality , more closely and were able to include certain type of errors such as crosstalk which were beyond the scope of the treatment by @xcite .",
    "they found that the energy uncertainties are likely to exceed 20% for the observations made with the vector magnetographs present at that time ( e.g. msfc ) .    here",
    ", our approach is very similar to that of @xcite except that we consider full stokes profile measurements to derive the magnetic fields like in the most of the recent vector magnetographs e.g. , hinode ( sot / sp ) , svm - uso etc . as mentioned earlier .",
    "we begin with an analytical field , determine polarization signal as explained in earlier parts , introduce the random noise of certain known levels ( 0.5% & 2.0% of i@xmath57 ) in the polarization profiles , infer an ` observed ' magnetic field after doing the inversion of the noisy profiles , compute an ` observed ' magnetic energy from the ` observed ' field and then compare this energy with the energy of the ` true ' magnetic field .",
    "the percentage error is calculated from the following expression : @xmath69 where e@xmath70 is ` observed ' energy and e@xmath3 is ` true ' energy .",
    "all the above processes have been described in detail in section 4 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the uncertainty estimated in the calculation of magnetic energy in two cases when error in the polarimetric profiles is 0.5% and 2.0% of i@xmath2 .",
    "needless to say , we first checked the procedure by calculating the magnetic energy from the vector fields derived from inverted results with no noise in the profiles .",
    "we found the same energy as calculated from the initial analytical fields .",
    "we can see that the magnetic energy can be calculated with a very good accuracy when less noise is present in the polarization as is observed in the modern telescopes like hinode ( sot / sp ) for which very small ( of the order of 10@xmath1 of i@xmath57 ) noise is expected in profiles .",
    "we find that a mean of 0.5% and maximum up to 2% error is possible in the calculation of magnetic energy with such data .",
    "so , the magnetic energy calculated from the hinode data will be very accurate provided the force - free field condition is satisfied .",
    "the error in the determination of magnetic energy increases for larger levels of noise . in the case of high noise in profiles",
    "( e.g.  2.0% of i@xmath2 ) the energy estimation is very much vulnerable to the inaccuracies of the field values .",
    "we replaced the inverted value of the field parameters with the analytical value wherever the inverted values deviated by more than 50% of the ` true ' values .",
    "we then get the result shown in the right panel .",
    "we can see that the error is very small even in this case .",
    "the mean value of error is @xmath71 .",
    "we have discussed the direct method of estimating @xmath61 from vector magnetograms using the @xmath72 moment of minimization .",
    "the higher order moments also hold promise for generating an index for predicting the flare productivity in active regions .",
    "the global value of twist of an active region can be measured with a very good accuracy by calculating @xmath61 .",
    "accurate value of twist can be obtained even if one polarity of a bipole is observed .",
    "the magnetic energy calculation is very accurate as seen from our results .",
    "very less error ( approximately 0.5% ) is seen in magnetic energy with 0.5% noise in the profiles .",
    "thus we conclude that the magnetic energy can be estimated with very good accuracy using the data obtained from modern telescopes like hinode ( sot / sp ) .",
    "this gives us the means to look for magnetic energy changes released in weak c - class flares which release radiant energy of the order of 10@xmath73 ergs ( see appendix - c ) , thereby improving the statistics .",
    "these energy estimates are however subject to the condition that the photospheric magnetic field is force - free , a condition which is not always met with .",
    "we must then obtain the energy estimates using vector magnetograms observed at higher atmospheric layers where the magnetic field is force - free @xcite .",
    "the 180@xmath43 azimuthal ambiguity ( aa ) is another source of error for determining parameters like @xmath61 and magnetic free energy in real sunspot observations .",
    "the smaller the polarimetric noise , the smaller is the uncertainty in azimuth determination , thereby allowing us to extend the range of the acute angle method used in our analysis . on the other hand",
    "it is difficult to predict the level of uncertainty produced by aa .",
    "influence of aa is felt more at highly sheared regions which will anyway deviate from the global alpha value .",
    "thus , avoiding such pixels will improve determination of @xmath61 .",
    "magnetic energy calculation at such pixels could be done by comparing energy estimates obtained by ` flipping ' the azimuths and choosing the mean of the smallest and the largest estimate of the energy .",
    "here we assume that half the number of pixels have the true azimuth .",
    "this is the best one can do for a problem that really has no theoretical solution allowed by the zeeman effect ( but see also , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "observational techniques such as use of chromospheric chirality @xcite or use of magnetograms observed from different viewing angles could perhaps resolve the aa .",
    "patches of both signs of alpha can be present in a single sunspot @xcite . in those cases",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath61 becomes unclear .",
    "efforts are needed to understand the origin of such complex variation of @xmath0 in a sunspot .",
    "real sunspots show filamentary structures . if this structure is accompanied by local variations of @xmath0 , then does the global @xmath0 result from correlations in the local @xmath0 values ? or , are the small scale variations due to a turbulent cascade from the large scale features ? the answers to these questions are beyond the scope of our present study .",
    "modeling sunspots with such complex fine structures is a great challenge .",
    "however , we plan to address the question of fine structure of twists in real sunspots observed from hinode ( sot / sp ) , in our forthcoming study .    for the present",
    ", we demonstrate that the global twist present in an active region can be accurately measured without ambiguity in its sign .",
    "furthermore , the high accuracy of magnetic energy estimation that can be obtained using data from modern instruments will improve the probability for detecting the flare related changes in the magnetic energy of active regions .",
