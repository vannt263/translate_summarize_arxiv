    "recent years have seen a growing interest in models that , albeit possessing ordered ground states , are capable of displaying glassy behaviour @xcite .",
    "other models contain a priori ingredients that prevent them from reaching or even possessing a crystalline state ; examples of these ingredients are : quenched disorder @xcite , competing interactions @xcite , polydispersity @xcite , modified long - range potentials @xcite , and constrained interactions @xcite . while these factors may fit naturally in the description of systems characterized by a quenched disorder , like spin glasses , they seem less suitable to the description of structural glasses since they explicitly suppress crystallization , unlike most of real systems that , on the contrary , are potentially good crystal formers .",
    "the use of models with such a priori ingredients is motivated by both practical and theoretical reasons . from a practical point of view ,",
    "numerical simulations are limited to relatively small lattices , so that large collective effects that in real systems could be at the origin of glassy behavior can be very depressed : e. g. molecular dynamics simulation of identical atoms interacting via a lennard - jones potential eventually produces crystalline configurations also in the presence of very fast cooling . from a theoretical point of view , thermodynamic stability excludes the possibility that systems with translational invariance and short range interactions could possess metastable states at finite temperatures @xcite . on the other hand , formation of large and pure crystals",
    "is uncommon in nature , and even their growth in a laboratory is not a simple task , despite the fact that freezing of matter into non - crystalline phases is contrary to what would be expected from equilibrium thermodynamics .    for the above reasons it would be desirable to have models capable of displaying glassy behavior without the introduction of any kind of quenched disorder or special interactions , and to have simple models sheding some light on the mechanisms that drive crystal formers away from crystallization .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to show under which circumstance some simple lattice models , with neither quenched disorder nor constraining rules , are capable of relaxing into a glassy state .",
    "we will specifically investigate the potts and the exclusion models , showing that the conditions which prevent the ordering are the same in the two models .",
    "it has been observed that some exclusion models @xcite , where crystalline states are expected as a consequence of the given dynamical evolution rules , ( see sections below ) are pinned into some noncrystalline state . in these models",
    "the occupation of a lattice site by a particle excludes the occupation of a certain set of neighboring sites by other particles and it may happen that the effects of excluded volume prevent the system from settling down to the ordered state @xcite .",
    "it has been found in particular @xcite that when on a square lattice the exclusion of first and second nearest - neighbours is imposed , the system slowly approaches a state in which particles are arranged to form different macroscopic crystalline domains .",
    "however , when exclusion of third nearest - neighbours is also imposed , the system jams into noncrystalline configurations @xcite .",
    "the properties of the above models suggest that the glassy state ( in the sense quantitatively defined in the next sections ) emerges after a sudden cooling in systems that , when in thermodynamic equilibrium , display a sufficient number of equivalent crystalline states or coexisting ordered phases at low temperatures , and a disordered phase at high temperatures .",
    "this is the case of the potts model @xcite and exclusion models @xcite studied here .",
    "when in equilibrium , they suffer a phase transition which is continuous if the number of ground states is small and first - order if it is large .",
    "we implement the time relaxation of these models due to the cooling process by supplying them with a local stochastic dynamics . by means of extensive numerical simulations",
    "we find that whenever the equilibrium model exhibits a continuous phase transition the stochastic system relaxes towards the equilibrium order state , either a crystalline or a polycrystalline .",
    "however , when the transition is first - order , the stochastic system relaxes towards a nonequilibrium glassy state provided the thermodynamic limit be taken _ before _",
    "the infinite time limit .",
    "notice the reversion in the order of the limits when compared with the equilibrium case in which the thermodynamic limit is taken after the infinite time limit .",
    "in the @xmath0-state potts model @xcite each site of a regular lattice assumes one out of @xmath0 different possible states , or colour .",
    "if two nearest neighbour sites have the same colour their energy contribution is zero , otherwise they contribute by an amount @xmath1 to the system energy : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the sum is over the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "there are @xmath0 degenerate ground states , with zero energy , each one corresponding to having all sites the same colour .",
    "we stress that the energy is proportional to the length @xmath4 of the line separating regions of distinct colours ( line of defects ) , @xmath5 .",
    "we distinguish the states according to the value of @xmath4 . if @xmath6 , there is no defect and the state is crystalline .",
    "if @xmath7 but negligible , the state is polycrystalline , otherwise , if @xmath4 is not neglible the state is a noncrystalline state which we call a glassy state . by negligible we mean that the density of defects @xmath8 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the sudden cooling process is performed by simulating the potts model at zero temperature according to the metropolis dynamics @xcite starting with a random and uncorrelated configuration to mimic the infinite temperature state .",
    "we start by using periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . for long times",
    ", the system is expected to relax towards the state of minimum energy , @xmath9 , where all sites have the same colour .",
    "however , this may not happen and the system may be trapped in a noncrystalline configuration , similar to mondrian or van doesburg paintings , with many local traps with minimum energy in the shape of a `` '' separating different domains . this behavior is well known @xcite and is not found when fixed boundary conditions ( fbc ) are imposed to the lattice , i.e. , when one predetermined arbitrary colour is assigned to the sites beloging to the lattice boundary . with this prescription",
    "the system is forced to relax to the crystalline state and , after a slow relaxation which occur for an intermediate time regime , the system eventually enters into a fast relaxation stage by which all sites finally assume the same colour of the boundaries .    in fig .",
    "[ rf.1 ] we have plotted the density of defects @xmath10 against @xmath11 obtained from simulations of the 7-state potts model with both pbc and fbc on a square lattice with @xmath12 sites .     versus @xmath11 at large times , for the @xmath13-state potts model on a square lattice for several linear sizes @xmath14 and different boundary conditions ( pbc or fbc ) . ]    up to an intermediate time regime all curves display the same linear behavior , showing that the density of defects decays like @xmath11 @xcite independently of both the boundary conditions and the lattice size . at long times the behavior is distinct for each boundary condition .",
    "when pbc are used , the system reaches configurations with a nonzero density of defects @xmath10 .",
    "when fbc are used , a fast ( exponential ) relaxation enters into action at a characteristic time , the system eventually reaches the ground state and @xmath10 vanishes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rf.2 ] . the characteristic time increases with @xmath14 ( inset of the figure ) .",
    "extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit implies its divergence and the disappearance of the final relaxation towards the ground state . according to fig .",
    "[ rf.1 ] , the curves corresponding to pbc and fbc approach each other and are expected to become identical in this limit .",
    "the extrapolation of the linear region in fig .",
    "[ rf.1 ] gives a nonzero value of the density of defects @xmath15 when @xmath16 .",
    "this nonzero residual density of defects shows that the defects are not negligible in the thermodynamic limit and we are faced with a glassy states .     and fbc .",
    "an exponential regime can be detected ( thick dashed lines ) whose characteristic time @xmath17 increases linearly with the lattice size ( inset ) . ]",
    "we have investigated the density of defects for several values of @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rf.3 ] , and found that whenever @xmath18 the residual density of defects @xmath15 is nonzero . in the special case of @xmath19",
    ", there are logarithmic corrections in the time decay and our results for @xmath20 suggest the behavior @xmath21 . for different values of @xmath0 , the residual densities of defects resulting from our analysis are reported in the inset of fig .  [ rf.3 ] .     versus @xmath11 for the @xmath0-state potts model with @xmath22 up to @xmath23 on a square lattice of linear size @xmath24 with fbc .",
    "the inset shows the residual density of defects @xmath15 versus @xmath0 , including @xmath25 .",
    "the continuous line is a fitting of the type @xmath26 .",
    "the best fitting gives @xmath27 and @xmath28 . ]    on the basis of the results obtained , we can draw the following conclusions : _",
    "@xmath29 for @xmath30 the system relaxes towards a pure crystal ( no defects ) ; @xmath31 for @xmath32 the system forms a polycrystal ( negligible number of defects ) ; @xmath33 for @xmath34 the system relaxes towards a glassy state ( nonzero density of defects ) .",
    "_    existence of low temperature noncrystalline states was predicted on a general basis by lifshitz @xcite who argued that a @xmath35-dimensional system quenched below its critical point does not necessarily equilibrate into a pure state , in the presence of more than @xmath36 ordered ground states .",
    "the competition among different possible ordering processes would drive the system away from crystallization , although nothing is given to know about the length of the lines of defects .",
    "an interesting investigation on the formation of ordered vs disorered structures in the quench of some two dimensional lattice gas models can be found in @xcite .",
    "in exclusion models , adsorbed particles diffuse over the sites of a regular lattice in such a way that each adsorbed particle excludes the sites of a certain neighborhood from being occupied by other particles .",
    "the particles do not interact except through excluded volume repulsion .    in order to give a quantitative definition of a glassy state",
    "it can be considered tha case in which such a system is placed in contact with a particle reservoir .",
    "the energy of the system will be @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the chemical potential and @xmath39 is the number of adsorbed particles .",
    "the ground state is that of the closest packing because the number of deposited particles is maximum . here",
    "we set the zero of energy as that of the ground state so that the energy is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of particles in the close - packed state . with this definition ,",
    "the energy is proportional to the number of vacancies @xmath42 .",
    "again we may define a glassy state as being the state in which the density of vacancies @xmath43 is nonzero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "otherwise the state is either crystalline or polycrystalline .",
    "sudden cooling process at zero temperature in these systems has been investigated in the literature ( a recent review can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it can be performed by simulating the model according to the metropolis dynamics starting with an empty lattice . according to this dynamics particles either diffuse or are adsorbed . in the absence of diffusion a jamming state",
    "would be reached , in which all lattice sites would be blocked @xcite .",
    "however diffusion of adsorbed particles over the lattice allows for deposition of other particles whenever a site previously blocked is made free . in principle , a close - packed state may eventually be reached in which particles are arranged into a regular periodic pattern .",
    "we have considered exclusion models on a square lattice with different number of ground states .",
    "the first model studied ( @xmath44 model ) has two ground states and is defined by imposing the exclusion of the nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "this corresponds to a system of hard squares , each one having an area equivalent to 2 unit cells and thus covering 2 sites of the lattice .",
    "the close - packed state in this case consists of a checkerboard - like arangements of particles and can occur on two different sub - lattices .",
    "models with a different number of ground states can be designed in a similar way , by the exclusion of a suitable set of neighbours .",
    "it is known @xcite that for the @xmath44 model , the deposition - diffusion process leads to ordering into one of the two ground states . for determining the behavior of models with a different number of ground states we have investigated numerically the models with exclusion of both first and second neighbors , @xmath45 @xcite and of third neighbors as well , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 model corresponds to a system of hard plane objects , each one covering 4 sites of the lattice ; whereas in @xmath46 each hard object covers 5 sites . in analogy with the case of the potts model",
    "we have plotted the density of vacancies @xmath10 versus @xmath11 .     versus @xmath11 for the exclusion models @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 on a square lattice . for each model , the linear size of the lattice are @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . ]    fig .",
    "[ rf.4 ] shows the decay of @xmath50 for the @xmath46 model .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath51 allows to conclude that in this case @xmath52 when @xmath53 . on the contrary , simulations of the @xmath45 model reported also in fig .",
    "[ rf.4 ] show that in this case @xmath54 when @xmath53 , although as @xmath55 . by considering the number @xmath0 of sites covered per hard plane object in each model we are thus lead to the same conclusions as for the potts model : _",
    "@xmath29 in the @xmath44 model , @xmath22 and the system relaxes towards a pure crystal ( no vacancies ) ; @xmath31 in the @xmath45 model , @xmath20 and the system forms a polycrystal ( negligible number of vacancies ) ; @xmath33 in the @xmath46 model , @xmath56 and the system relaxes towards a glassy state ( nonzero density of vacancies ) .",
    "these conclusions show that the ability of these systems to form glassy states depends on the number of equivalent crystalline states as a consequence of the competition among different ordered domains .",
    "the critical number @xmath57 of equivalent crystalline states above which the glassy state emerges is found to be @xmath58 both for the potts and the exclusion models on a square lattice .",
    "we have also perfomed numerical simulations of the potts model on a triangular lattice for values of @xmath0 ranging from @xmath22 up to @xmath59 and found that the density of defects vanishes in the infinite time limit .",
    "these results are consistent with the results obtained by sahni et al @xcite in which domains grow without limits in the potts model on a triangular lattice but are pinned on a square lattice .    the results obtained on the square lattice suggest that the observed glassy states might be related to the presence of a first - order transition .",
    "in fact , the equilibrium two - dimensional potts model suffers a phase transition from a disordered state , at high temperatures , to an ordered state with @xmath0 coexisting phases , at low temperatures , which is continuous for @xmath60 , and first - order for @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "analogous features have been observed in the exclusion models studied here : in equilibrium , @xmath44 and @xmath45 models display a second - order transition whereas the @xmath46 model show a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this letter show that systems with translational invariance and short range interactions may be driven away from crystallization by the competition among a number of coexisting ordered states . for the models considered here , i. e. the potts model and the exclusion models on the square lattice",
    ", the number of states above which ordering is destroyed corresponds to the appearance of a first - order transition in the equilibrium diagram of the systems and is the same for the two models .",
    "these results are obtained by reversing the usual order in which limits are taken when doing equilibrium statistical mechanics , i. e. the limit @xmath62 is taken before @xmath53 . within this approach ,",
    "our simulations indicates that the characteristic time for the system to relax to the ground states may grow faster than the system size , in the sense that thermodynamic equilibrium is never attained @xcite ."
