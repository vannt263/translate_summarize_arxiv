    "the manuscript at hand concerns the combinatorics of renormalization of tensor field theory ( tft ) models .",
    "tft models are a path integral formulation of quantum field theories ( qft ) , whose feynman graphs correspond combinatorially to discrete geometries . in the perturbative expansion of the partition function of a tft model , to each such feynman graph",
    "is associated a probability ( called the feynman amplitude in qft ) , and accordingly we may understand the tft model as a quantum model of discrete geometry .",
    "recently , the first renormalizable rank four tft model with lie group valued field variables was formulated and studied by ben geloun and rivasseau @xcite . since then , the renormalizability of several other tft models has further been established @xcite .    on the combinatorial level of feynman graphs",
    "the renormalizability property can be phrased in a purely algebraic way , as was shown by connes and kreimer @xcite .",
    "this was followed by the formulation in terms of a riemann - hilbert correspondence for categories of differential systems by connes and marcolli @xcite .",
    "the connes - kreimer combinatorial approach to renormalization was initially applied to local qft models .",
    "when one generalizes to qft models on non - commutative spaces , such as the moyal space , locality is lost due to the quantum uncertainty relations between space coordinates .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that by replacing the notion of locality with a new concept , the so - called ` moyality ' property for interactions , the hopf algebraic structure of feynman graphs allowing for the renormalization of particular non - commutative models can be established .",
    "the connes - kreimer formalism of matrix field theory , whose two - stranded ribbon feynman graphs are dual to two - dimensional triangulated surfaces , was also considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition , hopf algebraic structures of quantum gravity spin foams , closely related to tft models , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the hopf algebra of tensorial feynman graphs of group field theory and the associated schwinger - dyson equations have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the current paper is then to continue in the above direction of research by formulating the combinatorial connes - kreimer hopf algebraic structure of the ben geloun - rivasseau ( bgr ) model .",
    "let us emphasize that this constitutes the first application of the connes - kreimer combinatorial renormalization to a tft model of rank-@xmath0 for @xmath1 .",
    "first important difference we note to the usual case of local qft is the structure of external constraints , namely , the momentum conservation of local qft is replaced by the so - called tensorial invariance .",
    "moreover , the implementation of the connes - kreimer formalism requires particular attention at the level of the @xmath2-point function insertions .",
    "this follows from the fact that the divergencies of the bgr @xmath2-point functions are not only dependent on the external topological data of the feynman graph , as in ordinary local qft models .",
    "thus , only when the superficial divergence degree is conserved , a bgr tensor graph insertion is defined to be non - trivial .",
    "this is a crucial difference with respect to the previously defined connes - kreimer structures for local qft .",
    "the basic feature of any qft model is that it gives a prescription for associating quantum probability amplitudes ( taking values in @xmath3 ) to physical processes . in the path integral formulation of a qft model",
    ", these amplitudes can be extracted from the generating functional @xmath4 of the model that is typically expressed as an infinite dimensional functional integral of the type w[j ] = d  e^-s [ ] + j  , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote some fields ( usually taken to be smooth sections of a fiber bundle ) , or collections of fields , on a fixed background manifold @xmath7 . @xmath8 $ ] is called the action functional defining the model , and the integral measure can typically be informally written as an infinite product of lebesgue measures over the field values at each point in @xmath7 , @xmath9 .",
    "then , the correlation functions @xmath10 for the monomials in the field variables , which correspond to the basic physical observables of the model , can be written as functional derivatives of the generating functional , [ eq : qftcorrelations ] ( x_1 ) ( x_n ) d  ( x_1 ) ( x_n ) e^-s [ ] = .",
    "w[j ] |_j=0  .",
    "the well - definedness of such an expression is , of course , highly questionable . indeed , apart from rare exceptions , these expressions are highly divergent .",
    "nevertheless , one can extract finite quantities from these formal divergent expressions , which have been shown to match experimental results with remarkable accuracy .",
    "the main tool in this direction is perturbation theory .",
    "typically the action functional is of the form @xmath8 = s_{{\\textrm}{kin}}[\\phi ] + s_{{\\textrm}{int}}[\\lambda;\\phi]$ ] , where @xmath11 $ ] is quadratic in the field variables , and the higher order polynomial interaction part @xmath12 $ ] is proportional to a collection of parameters @xmath13 , the coupling constants of the model .",
    "thus , the kinetic part @xmath11 $ ] by itself gives a simple ( infinite dimensional ) gaussian measure , whose correlation functions can be computed explicitly .",
    "one can then expand the integrand in equation ( [ eq : qftcorrelations ] ) in powers of the coupling constant(s ) @xmath13 , and in each finite order one ends up with a sum over products of correlation functions of the gaussian measure with given weights .",
    "it is these terms in the perturbative expansion , and their combinatorial structure in particular , for which feynman graphs provide a very convenient bookkeeping device .",
    "the contribution to the full correlation function associated to a particular feynman graph is called the corresponding feynman amplitude , and can be obtained from the graph by applying the set of feynman rules of the particular model .",
    "any finite order contribution is then obtained as a sum over the amplitudes of a finite number of feynman graphs .    however , individual terms in this perturbative series are generically divergent .",
    "this particular problem is addressed by the framework of perturbative renormalization .",
    "the connes - kreimer combinatorial hopf algebra of feynman graphs is aimed at organizing the renormalization of the individual feynman amplitudes in the perturbative expansion in a coherent unifying algebraic structure .",
    "let us then give a standard example of the general points discussed above about the relationship of feynman graphs to qft models : the @xmath14 scalar field model on @xmath15 ( with euclidean metric ) .",
    "this model is determined by the action functional @xmath8 = s_{{\\textrm}{kin}}[\\phi ] + s_{{\\textrm}{int}}[\\lambda;\\phi]$ ] , where [ act - x ] s_kin [ ] = _",
    "r^4 d^4x   ( + m^2 ) s_int [ ; ] = _ r^4 d^4x  ^4  .",
    "here , the single field @xmath5 takes values in @xmath16 , and the parameters of the model @xmath17 correspond to the mass of the particle species modelled and the coupling strength , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the laplace operator .",
    "the interaction is local in the sense that it couples the field values only at the same point in space .",
    "it is usual to consider the model in the momentum space , obtained through fourier transform , instead of the direct space , since due to the translation symmetry of the model the total momentum is conserved . in momentum space ,",
    "the action reads explicitly s_kin [ ] & = _",
    "r^4 ^4p  ( p ) ( |p|^2 + m^2 ) ( p ) , + s_int [ ; ] & = _ ( r^4)^4 ( p_1)(p_2)(p_3)(p_4 )",
    "^4(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4),[eq : phi4int ] where @xmath19 is the fourier transform of the field @xmath5 . in the interaction term , the dirac delta distribution @xmath20 imposes the so - called _ momentum conservation_. the covariance of the kinetic part , i.e. , the ( free ) _ propagator _ , can be explicitly computed to yield [ eq : freeprop ] p(p_1,p_2):= ( p_1 ) ( p_2 ) _ kin = d  ( p_1 ) ( p_2 ) e^-s_kin [ ] = ^4(p_1-p_2 ) .",
    "moreover , due to wick s theorem , any correlation function of such gaussian measure can be expressed as a sum of products of propagators [ eq : gausscorr ] ( p_1 ) ( p_2 ) ( p_2n ) _ kin = _ _ 2n/~ ( _ i=1^n ( p_(2i-1 ) ) ( p_(2i ) ) _ kin ) , where @xmath21 is the set of @xmath22 permutations of @xmath23 elements modulo the @xmath24 permutations of pairs of elements with indices @xmath25 and the @xmath26 permutations of elements within the pairs , i.e. , the set of all possible pairings of indices .",
    "] for a monomial of odd degree the correlation function vanishes , since the gaussian measure is symmetric .",
    "the qft perturbation expansion is based on this fact .",
    "for example , the @xmath28th order contribution to the full correlation function of @xmath2 field values , the _",
    "n - point function _ , is obtained by expanding the interaction part of the exponential integrand , and picking out the @xmath28th order term ( p_1 ) ( p_2 ) ( p_n ) _ k = d  ( p_1 ) ( p_2)(p_2 ) ( s_int[;])^k e^-s_kin [ ] . by substituting the explicit expression for the interaction term , and writing all the resulting correlation functions of the free theory in terms of propagators using and , one can explicitly calculate this @xmath28th order contribution to the @xmath2-point function of the theory . in qft ,",
    "the physical interpretation of this quantity is that it gives the ( non - normalized ) probability amplitude for a scattering process from an initial state with @xmath29 free particles having momenta @xmath30 to a final state with @xmath31 free particles having momenta @xmath32 .",

    "each feynman graph corresponds to an individual summand in the perturbative expansion of the correlation functions with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the feynman graphs of the @xmath14-model consist of a single type of edges ( the propagator ) labelled by a momentum variable and four - valent vertices ( the interaction ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi4 ] .",
    "the number of vertices in a feynman graph equals the order of the corresponding summand in the perturbative expansion .",
    "an arrow on an edge denotes the direction of the momentum flow @xmath42 , and can be assigned arbitrarily ; the opposite orientation corresponds to @xmath43 . in the following",
    "we will often just drop the momentum labels and arrows , since their specific assignment is immaterial  they can always be reintroduced arbitrarily .",
    "the feynman amplitude associated to a particular feynman graph is constructed as follows :    1 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the momenta labels on the edges @xmath45 of the feynman graph @xmath33 .",

    "3 .   integrate over @xmath44 associated to the internal edges of the graph .    the quantity that results from applying these rules to a feynman graph",
    "is the feynman amplitude of that graph .    for any feynman graph",
    ", the amplitude factorizes to the product of the amplitudes of its connected parts , so one can just focus only on connected feynman graphs . on the level of the generating functional ,",
    "the disconnected graphs can be removed by replacing @xmath51 $ ] with the logarithm @xmath52 $ ] in .",
    "moreover , it is common to restrict to consider the so - called one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) feynman graphs , or what are called bridgeless graphs in graph theory language .",

    "if there did exist a bridge , i.e. , an edge connecting two separate parts of the graph , the momentum conservation would fix the momentum flow on this edge , and make it trivial to consider the amplitude in two separate contributions , glued together simply through the identification of the momentum variables on both sides of the bridge .",
    "for example , by applying the above feynman rules to the feynman graph on the right - hand side of fig .",

    "however , we do not make a distinction here at the level of graph drawing . for a graph with two external edges , its contributions to wave function and mass renormalization are given by the external structures for each corresponding vertex . in figures [ fig : contrphi4 ] and [ fig : coprodphi4 ] we have provided some basic examples of the subgraph contraction operation and the coproduct , respectively , for @xmath14-model .    before ending this section ,",
    "let us emphasize the following fact of particular importance for the sequel .",
    "the 2-valent vertices are associated with a quadratic divergence , since the power - counting simply gives @xmath140 for them . due to this simple fact",
    "one may insert any graph with two external edges into a bare propagator of any feynman graph without changing the divergence degree of the graph , because one simultaneously needs to add a propagator , which adds a counter - balancing @xmath141 to the divergence degree .",
    "similarly , all 4-valent graphs are associated with a logarithmic divergence , which allows one to insert any graph with four external edges into a vertex without affecting the divergence degree .",
    "we already anticipate that this simple behavior does not hold for models with more complicated power - counting , such as the bgr model , in which case the notions of subgraph contraction insertion must be treated more carefully .",
    "the form of the bgr model derives from the combinatorics of 4-dimensional simplicial geometry . consider a 4-simplex .",
    "its boundary is given by five 3-simplices , i.e. , tetrahedra .",
    "each pair of these boundary tetrahedra shares one boundary triangle .",
    "this combinatorial structure can be illustrated by a stranded graph , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorvertex ] . here , each individual strand represents a triangle , while the five rectangular boxes , each connected to four strands entering the graph , represent the five boundary tetrahedra .",
    "the tetrahedra are considered colored , and we allow for two opposite orientations of the coloring .",
    "one considers colored tetrahedra and only two orientations of the coloring in order to simplify the combinatorics and the topology of this type of models ( see , for example , the paper @xcite , where this type of model was first introduced ) .",
    "one can then build larger stranded graphs from these building blocks by identifying boundary tetrahedra with matching colors .",
    "moreover , we allow only for identification of tetrahedra belonging to 4-simplices of opposite orientations , taken into account by alignment of arrows in the boxes representing tetrahedra . the resulting stranded graph will then be combinatorially dual to a 4-dimensional simplicial pseudo - manifold .",
    "a ( quantum ) statistical description of such simplicial geometries can be formulated as a colored tensor model .",
    "this is a qft model , whose feynman graphs have exactly such stranded structure .",
    "the model has fields of five different colors ( each colored block in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorvertex ] being a field ) and each such field is a complex - valued function on @xmath142 .",
    "the two stranded graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorvertex ] correspond to the two interaction terms of the model , while the propagator simply identifies the strands of the same color associated to interaction terms with opposite orientations .",
    "such models are sometimes called _ combinatorially non - local _ due to the combinatorial nature of the non - locality of their interaction terms .",
    "the feynman graphs of the bgr model are obtained from such stranded representations of simplicial geometry by removing four of the five fields ( namely the blue , the red , the green and the yellow fields in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorvertex ] above ) .",
    "thus , one considers interaction terms such as those illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgrvertices6 ] and fig .",

    "[ fig : bgrnonstrandedgraph ] reads @xmath178 with the same notation for the momenta as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgrgraph1 ] .",
    "the difference to the previous is that now there are only three internal strands corresponding to @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "the superficial divergence degree of this graph is @xmath179 despite the subdivergence , since the propagators contribute negatively to the power counting . in the following we state the power counting more explicitly .",
    "the feynman amplitude of any other bgr tensor graph may be computed in an analogous way .",
    "we leave as an exercise to the interested reader the calculation of amplitudes for the rest of the graphs of this section .",

    "[ fig : bgrnonstrandedgraph ] .",
    "the vertices are labeled , for example , as @xmath180 , where the lower index indicates the vertex type and the upper indices indicate the permutation of field variables .",
    "since the vertex is not symmetric under permutations of edges , the edges meeting at a vertex must be distinguished .",
    "this can be accomplished , for example , by placing the vertex label between the first and the last edge , where the edges are ordered in a right - handed orientation around the vertex with respect to the normal pointing upwards from the surface , on which the graph is drawn .",
    "let us give the following definition :    a _ face _ of a stranded feynman graph is a strand that forms a loop .",
    "note that a face of a stranded graph is dual to the corresponding triangle of the tetrahedra of the four - dimensional triangulation .",
    "the integrations over face momenta may give rise to divergencies , as we have already observed . in order for a strand to form a loop ,",
    "the non - stranded representation must clearly have a loop as well .",
    "however , a loop in the non - stranded representation does not imply the existence of a face as can be seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgrgraphexample3 ] .",
    "moreover , a face may extend around several loops of the non - stranded graph , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgrgraphexample4 ]",
    ".    therefore , the faces can be highly non - local objects on the graph .",
    "fortunately , the power counting restricts the non - locality of divergent faces significantly , as we will see in the following .",
    "notice also that faces can not extend over bridges of the non - stranded feynman graph , since due to the coloring a single strand can pass the same propagator only once .",
    "therefore , 1pi feynman graphs are still sufficient to resolve the divergence structure of feynman amplitudes of the bgr model .",
    "one has :    a superficial divergence degree for the bgr model is given by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath69 are the numbers of faces and propagators in @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "accordingly , all the allowed insertions lead to superficially divergent graphs , and the claim follows .",

    "it is therefore enough to show that for a fixed @xmath211 , we have _ / /=",
    "_  ( /)/  .",

    "as we have assumed these properties to hold , we conclude the proof .",
    "our main theorem then follows :    let @xmath226 be the unital associative algebra freely generated by the 1pi feynman graphs of the ben geloun - rivasseau tgft model . then @xmath227 is a hopf algebra , where    * the unit @xmath228 is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath107 is the empty graph . *",

    "therefore , the antipode follows from formula ( [ eq : srecurs ] ) .",
    "the 6-point function feynman amplitude ( without two- or four - point sub - divergencies ) of the ben geloun - rivasseau model can then by formally identified to the general formula given in theorem [ thm : ren ] _ r ( ) = s^_r ( ( ) ) ( ) , where s^_r ( ( ) ) = - r [ ( ) ] - r , is given through recursion .",
