    "given a closed compact surface @xmath0 endowed with a cellular decomposition @xmath17 , ( e.g. with a triangulation ) one can consider the group of `` combinatorial '' automorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , say that a homeomorphism @xmath18 is or @xmath17-homeomorphism , if it maps @xmath19-cells to @xmath19-cells , and @xmath20 is @xmath17-trivial if it preserves every cell and its orientation .",
    "then the group of of @xmath17 is the group of @xmath17-homeomorphisms modulo @xmath17-trivial ones .",
    "denote this group by @xmath21 .",
    "it was proved by r.  cori and a.  machi  @xcite and j.  ir and m.  koviera  @xcite that every finite group is isomorphic with @xmath21 for some cellular decomposition of some surface which can be taken equally either orientable or non - orientable .",

    "then in many cases ( e.g. when @xmath0 is orientable ) one can construct a smooth function @xmath24 such that @xmath23 is a critical level contaning saddles ( i.e. critical points being not local extremes ) , and the group @xmath21 can be regarded as the group of `` '' of @xmath6 .",

    "the main result of the present paper describes the structure of the group of automorphisms of the kronrod - reeb graph @xmath5 induced by isotopic to the identity diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 .",

    "then @xmath6 is said to be at @xmath39 to @xmath40 is there exist germs of diffeomorphisms @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "since both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are orientable , one can say about local minimums and local maximums of @xmath4 with respect to that orientation .",

    "let @xmath54 be a subset consisting of maps , i.e. maps having only non - degenerate critical points .",

    "by morse lemma a non - degenerate critical point of a function @xmath4 is equivalent to a homogeneous polynomial @xmath58 which , evidently , has no multiple factors , and so satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "hence @xmath60    in  @xcite the author computed the homotopy types of @xmath26 and @xmath7 for all @xmath61 .",
    "it was proven that if @xmath61 , then , except for few cases , @xmath35 is contractible , @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it was also established that the fundamental group @xmath13 contains a normal subgroup isomorphic to @xmath62 for some @xmath63 , and that the factor group @xmath64 is finite .    in a typical situation ,",

    "we characterize the class of all finite groups that arise as the group @xmath14 in   for the case when @xmath0 is orientable and differs from sphere and torus , see theorem  [ th : gf_m_or ] .    for its proof",
    "we first show that a finite group @xmath14 has the form   for some @xmath61 if and only if @xmath14 admits a special action on a finite tree .",
    "further , in theorem  [ th : rg_tg ] , we prove that groups having that actions are exactly the ones obtained from finite cyclic and dihedral groups by operations of direct product and wreath product from the top .",
    "the latter statement can be regarded as an extension of an old result of c.  jordan mentioned above about characterization of groups of automorphisms of finite trees .    as a consequence",
    "we also obtain that @xmath13 is always solvable , see theorem  [ th : pi1orbf_is_solvable ] .",
    "in  [ sect : enhanced_kr_graph ] we will recall from  @xcite the definitions of an kronrod - reeb graph @xmath5 of @xmath61 and how @xmath26 acts on @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is morse , then @xmath5 coincides with the usual kronrod - reeb graph of @xmath6 .",
