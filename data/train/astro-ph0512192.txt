    "the interaction of a charged particle with a gravitational wave ( gw ) has been studied by using a hamiltonian formalism ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "this approach is similar to the one used for the study of the interaction of ions with electrostatic waves in magnetized plasmas ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the existence of chaos in phase space has been shown as a consequence of the overlap of resonances .",
    "recently , the acceleration of the charged particles due to the chaotic diffusion has been associated with bursts @xcite .",
    "however , such a diffusion is obtained for relatively high energy particles and becomes efficiently present only for large amplitude values of the gw ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a parametric resonance in the general problem of interaction between particles and waves is discussed in the classical book of landau and lifshitz @xcite . for the particular problem",
    "kleidis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a parametric resonance arises for a set of frequencies of the gw of the form @xmath1 and an estimation of its width is given .",
    "also , the parametric resonance has been associated with the existence of chaotic motion .    in the present paper",
    "we study the possible fast acceleration of low energy particles for small amplitudes of the gw by taking into account two special properties of the system .",
    "the first is the parametric resonance which , as we shall show , arises only for @xmath2 .",
    "the second property is the integrability of the system , and subsequently the absence of chaos , when the gw propagates in a parallel direction with that of the magnetic field .    in section 2",
    "we review the hamiltonian formalism of the model which describes the interaction . in section 3 ,",
    "we study systematically the rise of a parametric resonance and in section 4 we prove the integrability of the system in the case of parallel propagation .",
    "it is shown in section 5 that when the above integrable case is in parametric resonance fast acceleration of particles occurs .",
    "the astrophysical implications are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the dynamics of a charged particle in a curved space - time and in the presence of a uniform magnetic field can be studied by considering the hamiltonian ( see @xcite ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the generalized coordinates and momenta of the particle , respectively .",
    "the metric @xmath6 defines the curved space - time and @xmath7 are the components of the vector potential @xmath8 of the magnetic field .",
    "it can be considered that the curvature of space - time is due to a gravitational wave ( gw ) . by considering a linearly polarized gw propagating in a direction @xmath9 of angle @xmath10 with respect to the axis @xmath11 , a possible form of the tensor @xmath6 is the following @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the minkovski space - time and @xmath14 is the amplitude of the gravitational wave . by using the metric tensor derived in @xcite and expanding its components up to @xmath15 we",
    "obtain the nonzero components of the tensor @xmath16 in the following form @xmath17 where @xmath18 the constant parameter @xmath19 is associated with the frequency @xmath20 of the gw . in the case of a uniform magnetic field @xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath22 , we may choose a system of units where the larmor frequency of the particles is @xmath23 .",
    "in this case @xmath19 is the ratio of the gw frequency to the larmor frequency i.e. @xmath24 .    by substituting in ( [ hoo ] )",
    "the above specific expressions and performing a canonical transformation to new canonical variables ( @xmath25 ) ( for details see @xcite ) we get @xmath26 the variables @xmath27 are associated with the gyro motion of the particles in the magnetic field , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the particle s energy and @xmath30 its velocity .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 is a constant of motion due to the symmetries of the original system .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) we can easily obtain the periodic solution @xmath32 the solution ( [ po ] ) corresponds to rest particles since it provides @xmath33 ( the energy of the rest mass ) . because of the restriction @xmath34 we should set @xmath35 in order our system to possess the above special solution .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is now written in the form @xmath36 and the solution ( [ po ] ) is periodic of period @xmath37 .    by considering the variations @xmath38 corresponding to the variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , the variational equations for the periodic solution ( [ po ] ) are @xmath41    furthermore , let @xmath42 be the monodromy matrix . considering the unperturbed system ( i.e. @xmath43 ) we obtain from the monodromy matrix @xmath42 the stability index @xmath44 the condition @xmath45 , ensures the linear stability of the periodic orbits for all values @xmath19 except for @xmath46 .",
    "these values are candidates for the generation of a parametric resonance .    in the perturbed system",
    "we examine the stability by following the methodology described by yakubovich and starzhinskii @xcite , p.357 . the variational equations ( [ veqs0 ] )",
    "are of the form @xmath47 and the fundamental @xmath48 matrix of solutions is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a @xmath51-periodic matrix , @xmath52 is the matrix of coefficients of the linear system ( [ veqs0 ] ) and @xmath53 are constant matrices calculated from the variational equations ( [ veqs1 ] ) on the periodic orbit . after some calculations we find @xmath54 .",
    "the nonzero components of the matrix @xmath55 are @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the stability of the periodic solution is given by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath59 defined in ( [ veqs1 ] ) , which are @xmath60 conclusively for every value of @xmath14,@xmath10 and @xmath61 the eigenvalues @xmath62 are purely imaginary and the periodic orbit that corresponds to the rest particles is stable .",
    "therefore , for arbitrarily small amplitude values @xmath14 , instability ( parametric resonance ) may occur only at @xmath2 . at this value",
    "the above method fails to classify the periodic orbit and we proceed to a numerical investigation .",
    "namely , we obtain the monodromy matrix by integrating numerically the variational equations beside the canonical equations of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) for various values of the amplitude @xmath14 of the gravitational wave and of the propagation angle @xmath10 .     for some typical values of the propagation angle @xmath10.,width=302 ]    ) for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and ( a ) @xmath65 , ( b ) @xmath2 ,",
    "( c ) @xmath66.,width=491 ]    as it is shown in figure 1 , the periodic orbit becomes unstable in a v - shaped region of parameters centered at @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that the borders of the parametric resonance can be approximated by the fitting formula @xmath67 and the instability region broadens as @xmath68 , i.e. towards the parallel propagation . in figure 2",
    "we present the poincare sections of ( [ ham2 ] ) on the plane @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the periodic orbit correspond to the fixed point of the sections .",
    "we see that at the parametric resonance at @xmath2 a pitchfork bifurcation of the periodic orbit ( [ po ] ) occurs",
    ". two stable periodic orbits bifurcate , which correspond to @xmath71 , while the periodic orbit ( [ po ] ) becomes unstable and the associated stable and unstable manifolds form a separatrix curve of figure - eight .    the poincare section of system ( [ ham2 ] ) can be defined also in the plane of variables @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "then the topology of the section in fig.2b is represented in the section @xmath72 as it is shown in fig.3a .",
    "the unstable periodic orbit ( [ po ] ) , indicated by p@xmath74 , appears at @xmath75 and its separatrix curve is located in the enegry domain @xmath76 . for any initial conditions the particle s energy @xmath77 shows regular bounded oscillation of librational type around @xmath78 or rotational type above the separatrix @xmath79 .",
    "the stable periodic orbit , which is generated by the pitchfork bifurcation and indicated as p@xmath80 , corresponds to energy value @xmath81 .",
    "as it is illustrated in fig.3b , the value @xmath81 depends on both parameters @xmath14 and @xmath10 .",
    "it holds always @xmath82 and also we can obtain by fitting that @xmath83 for @xmath84 . consequently , as @xmath68 , the energy oscillations increase rapidly their amplitude and at @xmath85 all particles are ejected to infinite energy independently of the amplitude of the gw .",
    "this special case is studied in the following section .",
    "plane for @xmath2 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "( b ) the energy @xmath81 of the bifurcated stable periodic solution as a function of the propagation angle @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath68 we obtain that @xmath83.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we consider @xmath85 , i.e. the gw propagates in parallel direction with the magnetic field .",
    "then the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) takes the form @xmath86 the corresponding canonical equations are : @xmath87    from equation ( [ h0a ] ) we obtain directly that @xmath88 and subsequently equations ( [ h0c ] ) and ( [ h0d ] ) consist a linear non - autonomous system . providing a solution",
    "@xmath89 the system turns to be integrable for any values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath19 . the poincare section in fig.4a , indicates the regular oscillations of the particle s energy for all initial conditions .",
    "such a situation changes at the parametric resonance for @xmath2 and the dynamics is depicted by the poincare section in fig.4b .",
    "we obtain that the stable and the unstable manifolds which originate from the unstable periodic orbit ( [ po ] ) are located at @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , respectively , and extend from @xmath33 up to infinity .",
    "the dynamics becomes purely hyperbolic .    ) for ( a ) @xmath93 , @xmath94 and ( b ) @xmath2 , @xmath95 .",
    "the up and down directed arrows indicate the unstable and stable manifolds , respectively.,width=510 ]    the linear system of eqs .",
    "( [ h0c ] ) and ( [ h0d ] ) is not directly solvable . by differentiating and introducing the variable transformation @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    ", we derive the separable system of second order equations @xmath98 if we introduce the new time variable @xmath99 and omit the terms @xmath100 the above equations take the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for either @xmath103 or @xmath104 , the minus sign refers to @xmath104 and the plus sign to @xmath103 and prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath105 .",
    "equation ( [ meq ] ) is a mathieu type equation with solutions of the form @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a periodic function @xcite . in the parameter space @xmath108 stable and unstable regions",
    "are defined where @xmath109=0 $ ] and @xmath109\\neq 0 $ ] respectively . for the actual system ( [ ham20 ] )",
    "the unstable region is the v - shaped region shown in fig . 1 for @xmath85 . in fig.5a",
    "we present an example of the oscillations of the variable @xmath110 which correspond to the trajectory along the unstable manifold for @xmath2 .",
    "such a variation is associated with an increase of the particle s energy @xmath111 . from ( [ ham20 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath112 the increase of @xmath77 is exponential ( see fig .",
    "4b ) and the numerical study suggest that for @xmath113 , the associated exponent coincides with the amplitude of the gw , i.e. @xmath114     of the gyro motion of a particle in the parametric resonance ( b ) the exponential increase of energy @xmath115 for the evolution along the unstable manifold .",
    "the corresponding parameters are @xmath2 , @xmath63 and @xmath116.,width=453 ]",
    "in previous studies , mentioned in the introduction , the acceleration of the particles is a result of the chaotic diffusion .",
    "however , wide chaotic regions are formed only for high energy levels and in the presence of very strong gravitational waves ( @xmath117 ) @xcite . especially , for small values of the propagation angle @xmath118 chaotic regions appear in phase space only as very thin bounded zones around islands formed according to the poncare - birkhoff theorem .",
    "consequently , acceleration of low energy particles under the perturbation caused by weak gws can occur only through the parametric resonance ( @xmath2 ) at the integrable case ( @xmath85 ) .    in a more realistic situation ,",
    "the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic field met by the particles is not constant .",
    "according to the results obtained in the previous sections , the charged particles will accelerate when the magnetic field becomes almost parallel to the direction of the gravitational wave and have a magnitude such that @xmath119 .",
    "a simple simulation that illustrates this situation is described below .",
    "we consider that the propagation angle between the gw , with constant @xmath2 , and the direction of the magnetic field varies in time linearly as @xmath120 the time variable @xmath121 is the coordinate time @xmath122 in the original form ( [ hoo ] ) of the system .",
    "the slope parameter @xmath123 controls the time span spent by the particle in an interval ( @xmath124 ) and , particularly , the critical time interval @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "a typical example of the evolution of a particle under the above condition is shown in fig.6a .",
    "we observe that the particle , which starts with low energy @xmath127 ( particularly @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 , obeys small oscillations for approximately @xmath130 .",
    "when the system approaches the integrable hyperbolic dynamics at @xmath85 , the particle accelerates and a significant jump in particle s energy occurs . leaving the hyperbolic domain ( @xmath131 ) the particle",
    "is captured in a regular phase space domain with corresponding energy @xmath132 significantly greater than @xmath133 ( particularly , @xmath134 ) .",
    "the total increase in energy , @xmath135 , depends on the critical time interval @xmath125 and the @xmath10-width , @xmath136 , where the hyperbolic structure is effective . for the particular simple model it holds that @xmath137 .",
    "certainly , the most significant parameter for the acceleration is the amplitude @xmath14 of the gw which is associated with the exponential rate of the acceleration along the unstable manifolds in phase space according to the estimation ( [ gammaexp ] ) . in fig.6b",
    "we present the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath135 derived by the numerical simulation for some particular values of the parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we observe that , if the critical time @xmath125 is sufficiently large ( or @xmath123 is small ) , the energy jump is notable even for very small values of @xmath14 .",
    "the same qualitative results are obtained when we keep constant the propagation angle @xmath85 and change the parameter @xmath19 passing through the value @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that gravitational waves with frequency @xmath20 and amplitude @xmath138 can accelerate charged particles to very high energies when two conditions are met ( a ) the gravitational wave propagates along the external magnetic field ( @xmath139 ) and ( b ) the ratio of the gravitational wave frequency to gyro frequency is about 2 ( @xmath140 . the model used has a number of important simplifications : ( 1 ) we assume that the magnetic field is constant ( 2 ) the energy absorption by the particles is small compared to the energy curried by the gravitational wave and ( 3 ) we ignore the collective plasma effects associated with the particle acceleration .    retaining the above simplifications we may proceed to estimate the energy gained by the particles in a realistic astrophysical system .",
    "we assume that a volume of length @xmath141 is close to a source of gravitational waves .",
    "the volume is filled with plasma with density @xmath142 and the magnetic field is in a fully turbulent state .",
    "the gravitational wave is crossing the volume in few seconds and every time it travels along the ambient field ( @xmath143 ) with almost zero strength its energy increases .",
    "the zero strength magnetic field , which is associated to null surfaces , is an important requirement since the gravitational wave has low frequency ( of few khz ) and acceleration is possible only for @xmath119 ) .",
    "the energy increase is fast and can be substantial ( @xmath144 ) if the amplitude of the gravitational wave is @xmath145 . therefore the particles diffuse in energy space not by small random steps , as it was the case in the stochastic interaction studied earlier ( @xcite- @xcite ) , but through large random energy jumps .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this article to present a detailed analysis of the above process but we can present a rough estimate of the energy transferred from the gravitational wave to the plasma .",
    "let us assume that a particle travel a distance @xmath146 ( its trajectory is not a straight line ) before exiting the interaction volume .",
    "let us also assume that only in small parts of its trajectory ( @xmath147 a few kilometers ) the particle is able to meet the conditions needed for its acceleration .",
    "for a small portion of protons , e.g @xmath148 ) , which participate in the interaction , these regions can be a fraction of @xmath149 and the energy gain will be @xmath150 ( or @xmath151 ) , where @xmath152 is the mass of proton",
    ". the number of particles participating in this interaction can be as many as @xmath153 the total energy lost by the gravitational wave is , approximately , @xmath154 ergs , which constitute a small fraction of its total energy @xmath155 ergs ( see @xcite ) .    according to the model , the acceleration conditions ( @xmath139 , @xmath119 ) can be met sporadically along the trajectory of a charged particle in the vicinity of a gravitational wave source when the magnetized plasma is in a turbulent state .",
    "a few particles can then reach very high energies in a few seconds absorbing only a very small fraction of the gravitational wave .",
    "it remains to be seen , by performing further simulations , if the process described above for particle acceleration can be significant in a realistic astrophysical environment . in this case the electromagnetic emission from the accelerated particles can be a precursor of the gravitational wave for easier detection ."
