    ", @xmath12 is the usual temperature which is independent of the two times and on the chosen observable @xmath6 . out of equilibrium , in principle",
    "@xmath4 may depend on @xmath13 and @xmath6 and is not necessarily related to the temperature of the reservoir . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that @xmath4 exhibits the properties of a temperature , in the sense that it regulates the direction of heat fluxes favouring thermalization .",
    "specifically , if different degrees of freedom _ effectively _ interact on a given time scale , heat flows from those with higher @xmath4 to those with a lower one .",
    "the concept of effective temperature is possibly relevant when thermal flows are small ; in the context of aging systems this usually amounts to consider the large time regime . generally , in this asymptotic domain one can identify fast and slow degrees of freedom whose typical timescales @xmath14 and @xmath15 become widely separated . indeed , while @xmath16 is generally age - independent , @xmath17 is usually an increasing function of the age @xmath18 of the sample .",
    "when this happens , one can probe fast or slow degrees increasing the times @xmath13 along particular directions in the @xmath13 plane . specifically , by letting @xmath19 keeping @xmath20 finite , since @xmath21 the slow degrees act adiabatically and can be considered as static . in this time sector , denoted as the short time difference ( or quasi - equilibrium ) regime , one probes the dynamical behavior of fast modes .",

    "usually denoted as aging regime , the fast degrees act as a stationary background and the time evolution of the slow modes is probed . in a class of aging systems , among which mean field p - spin models and coarsening systems @xcite , the effective temperature ( here and in the following we simply quote the name for the quantity @xmath4 defined through eq . ( [ efftemp ] ) , without necessarily conforming to the debated interpretation of it as a thermodynamic temperature ) takes two different well defined values in the short time and in the aging regime . in the former sector",
    "one has @xmath12 , the bath temperature , while in the aging regime @xmath24 .",
    "a major difference between mean field glassy models and phase - ordering systems is that @xmath25 is finite in the former , while it is infinite in the latter .",
    "this simple two - temperature scenario , as opposed to that of a continuously varying @xmath4 displayed by models with full replica symmetry breaking , such as the sherrington - kirkpatrik spin glass , or some systems without local detailed balance @xcite , is amenable of a simple interpretation in terms of fast and slow components : the former which are already at the equilibrium temperature and the latter retaining a self - generated higher temperature @xmath25 .",
    "generally , the existence of different effective temperatures in the asymptotic domain implies that thermalization among different degrees of freedom is suppressed .",
    "while on the whole the mechanism whereby thermalization is avoided is uncertain , in the case of coarsening systems , at least in the solvable large-@xmath26 model ( @xmath26 being the number of components of the vector order parameter ) fast and slow degrees can be explicitly exhibited and their statistical independence can be proved @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with two temperatures being sustained and coexist in the system .",
    "however , the issue of heat exchanges occurring between fast and slow modes has never carefully been analyzed so far .    in this paper",
    "we tackle this question numerically in the physical case of coarsening systems with @xmath27 .",

    "this is perhaps the simplest case where the two - degrees / two - temperature scenario can be investigated .",

    "these features , which are presumably related to the fact that the model is at the lower critical dimensionality @xmath32 @xcite , make the interpretation of @xmath4 as a genuine temperature doubtful . however , for @xmath33 these features disappear and the two - temperature scenario is more sound .",

    "[ numsetup ] we will prepare the two systems as containing fast modes ( system 1 ) and a mixture of fast and slow ones ( system 2 ) .",
    "heat fluxes between different degrees will then be inferred from the knowledge of @xmath3 .",

    "this is the subject of the remaining of this section . in order to do that",
    ", it is first useful to understand the basic mechanisms whereby heat is transferred at stationarity .",
    "this can be better illustrated by considering first the case of two systems made by one single spin each .",
    "we also assume , for the moment , that the two spins are updated alternately with metropolis transition rates . denoting with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the two possible states of system 1 ( and similarly for 2 ) ,",
    "let us consider the case of an initial state @xmath90 which evolves in four steps as follows 1 _ , 2 _ 1 _ , 2 _ 1 _ , 2 _ 1 _ , 2 _ 1 _ , 2 _ [ scheme ] eventually returning to the initial state . in the initial state",
    "the system is in the lowest energy state . since 1",
    "is in contact with the higher temperature bath , it has a larger probability to be flipped first .",
    "if this happens , as in the first step in the scheme ( [ scheme ] ) , the heat @xmath91 ( equal to the energy increase @xmath55 of the system ) is transferred from the reservoir @xmath0 to 1 .",
    "now it is the turn of 2 to be updated . with metropolis rates it flips with probability one , because in doing so the energy decreases .",
    "then the heat @xmath92 is released by 2 to @xmath1 ( step two ) . at this stage a heat @xmath93 has been transferred between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : hence we conclude that the amount @xmath94 has flown between the two spins . now",
    "the system is again in the lowest energy state and , as before , the most probable evolution is the reversal of 1 , where a heat @xmath91 is again taken from the reservoir ( step three ) .",
    "this move surely induces the flip of 2 ( step four ) with a heat @xmath95 flowing to @xmath1 and another amount @xmath94 exchanged between the two systems . in conclusion , if this process happens , a heat @xmath96 flows from 1 to 2 .",
    "clearly , one can analogously imagine a process where @xmath97 , but this process implies that 2 flips first , which is less probable .",
    "this explains why , on average , @xmath3 is positive , even if negative fluctuations ( which in stationary states are regulated by eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) ) are possible .",
    "the physical mechanism described above is such that heat is transferred from one system to the other whenever the flip of one spin triggers the flip of the other .",
    "it is then quite natural to introduce a direct measure of the heat flow as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the energy variation of the system in the @xmath72-th step belonging to the interval @xmath100 , @xmath101 is a subset of steps where a flip has been triggered by a previous reversal of the other spin , and @xmath102 depending on the direction of the heat flow .",
    "we state that the flip of ( say ) 2 in the @xmath103-th step has been triggered if 1 and 2 were not aligned before reversing 2 , and 1 was the last spin flipped before @xmath103 . in this case heat",
    "is flowing from 1 to 2 and hence @xmath104 . in the opposite situation",
    "in which 1 is flipping at time @xmath103 and 2 was flipped previously one has @xmath105 .",
    "the same definition is meaningful if a different sequence of updates ( i.e. random ) is assumed and/or different transition rates are considered ( i.e. glauber ) .",
    "the main difference in this case is that after the flip of 1 , spin 2 is not forced to flip and it might happen that 1 recovers again its original value .",
    "however in this case there is no heat transfer between 1 and 2 , and this process does not alter the computation of @xmath3 .",
    "let us now consider the case of systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "the mechanism described in ( [ scheme ] ) is at work between any couple of spins on the interface between 1 and 2 .",
    "clearly , many other processes , involving also other spins away from the interface , may occur .",
    "however , they do not overrule our algorithm , since there is no heat transfer between 1 and 2 until the process arrives on the boundary between them .",
    "therefore , we can adopt the same operative definition for the heat transferred between any couple of spins on the interface , and @xmath3 is then obtained by summing all these contributions .    in order to test this method , we have prepared a system with the geometry discussed below eq .",
    "(    [ qdiff ] ) in a stationary state , and we have computed @xmath3 with this technique and , independently , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . if the method is reliable , the determination of @xmath3 should verify eq .",
    "( [ qdiff ] ) for large @xmath84 , so the probability distributions @xmath106 and @xmath107=q)$ ] should obey @xmath108 .",
    "these distributions are compared in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] . for small @xmath84",
    "they are quite different .",
    "this is expected due to the presence of the boundary term in eq .",
    "( [ qdifff ] ) .",
    "increasing @xmath84 , however , the boundary term becomes comparably smaller and the two curves tend to merge . to be more quantitative we plot , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , the _ distance _ d_as= [ distance ] between the two probability densities , showing that it is a steadily decreasing function .",
    "this shows that the algorithm for the direct measurement of @xmath3 is reliable .",
    "when one ( or both ) of the systems is aging , eq .",
    "( [ qdiff ] ) is spoiled by the extra heat released to the baths because the system is lowering its energy due to relaxation . in these cases",
    "the direct computation of @xmath3 according to the technique described above is mandatory . in the following",
    ", it will always be used to compute @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we study the heat exchanges in phase - ordering systems .",
    "we do this with the help of some numerical experiments designed to collect the statistics of the heat flowing between fast and slow degrees and among them and the reservoir .",
    "this will allow us to test the scenario with two statistically independent degrees coexisting at different ( effective ) temperatures and to discuss why such independence may be retained in the evolution .    in order to do",
    "that , the straightforward procedure would be to consider an aging system , to recognize and discriminate ( at any time ) fast and slow components , and hence to detect the heat they are exchanging .",
    "however , this is not easily realizable . indeed , although in a coarsening system we have an idea of what slow and fast modes are , a precise definition and separation of degrees is to a large extent arbitrary .",
    "moreover , if even one could find a technique suited to do that , this would be tuned to phase - ordering and the method would be restricted to coarsening systems .",
    "instead , we propose a different approach where two systems are coupled . preparing such systems so that the first is in equilibrium while the second coarsens , as will be detailed below , one may assume that slow degrees are confined in the second . as we shall discuss",
    ", this will allow us to proceed to the discussion of heat exchanges . in doing that",
    ", we adopt the same geometry as for the stationary case described in the previous section except that , in order to guarantee that the heat exchanged is small enough we have activated only two links , at distance @xmath87 , between the two systems . in all the cases we have chosen the parameters in such a way that the system is free from finite - size effects .",
    "system 1 is prepared in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath0 while system 2 is in an infinite temperature disordered configuration . at time @xmath109",
    ", sample 2 is brought in contact with the thermostat at the temperature @xmath110 while 1 interacts with a bath at the same temperature @xmath0 of its initial equilibrium state .",
    "then , from time @xmath7 onwards 2 ages via phase - ordering kinetics , while 1 remains in a stationary configuration .",
    "precisely , 1 is not stationary in principle , due to the coupling with the non - stationary system 2 , but this effect is negligible for large system sizes and few active links between the two sub - systems .",
    "moreover the effect is further suppressed in the asymptotic time domain , due to the progressive decrease of the number of slow degrees in sample 2 .",
    "indeed our simulations did not show any deviation from stationarity in 1 .",
    "the statistics of the heats is collected from some time @xmath18 to @xmath111 in a sample of size @xmath112 .",
    "notice that in the range of times considered in this simulation , represented by the dashed box in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figene ] , finite - size effects can be neglected .    indicating with @xmath113 , @xmath114 the fast degrees of freedom of the two coupled systems , with @xmath115 the slow ones , and with @xmath116 the heat exchanged between @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( and similarly for the heat exchanged between fast and slow ones ) , the general scheme of all the possible heat exchanges is summarized in figure [ schema ] .",
    "we start with the case in which the two baths are at the same temperature @xmath117 .",
    "this will allow us to draw some conclusion on the possibility that , in a single coarsening system , heat is released directly from the slow modes to the fast ones .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and of @xmath3 have been computed letting @xmath118 fixed while @xmath18 is increased ( we used values of @xmath18 up to @xmath119 , for different choices of @xmath120 ) .",
    "this will be referred to as the aging limit . for every choice of @xmath18 and @xmath120 we found a pattern of behaviors analogous to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ a1 ] , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 . here",
    "one sees that @xmath123 , because 2 is transferring the excess energy associated to the interfaces to the bath @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    "the heat @xmath124 is very small .",
    "this happens because with the present geometry @xmath3 can be exchanged only through two links and because we are working in the aging limit .",
    "indeed , while @xmath113 and @xmath114 are equilibrated at the same temperature , and hence @xmath125 , @xmath126 is the only contribution to @xmath127 .",
    "however , in the aging limit since @xmath128 and the number of slow modes which contribute to @xmath124 is @xmath129 , there is a number of order @xmath130 of terms in the double sum in eq .",
    "( [ quantoq ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "for the heats exchanged involving only fast degrees , such as @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , @xmath134 is constant and hence there is a number of order @xmath18 of terms contributing in eq .",
    "( [ quantoq ] ) .",
    "therefore , the heat @xmath124 is negligible with respect to the others .",
    "this shows that our experiments are performed in the limit of small average heat exchanged between the two systems .",
    "however , although small , @xmath124 is not strictly zero and its behavior parallels that of @xmath67 . this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figq12vsq2 ] where @xmath127 , @xmath83 and their ratio is plotted for different choices of @xmath120 . in the inset of this figure",
    "one sees that , after an initial transient , @xmath83 decays as @xmath135 .",
    "a similar behavior is found for @xmath136 , the main difference being an oscillating behavior superimposed on the @xmath135 decay .",
    "the origin of such oscillations is not completely clear and is probably related to the recurrent passage of interfaces across the boundary links .",
    "their amplitude can be suppressed by increasing @xmath120 , because collecting the heats on larger time windows effectively averages out the oscillating behavior . for @xmath137",
    "the periodic behavior is basically washed away .",
    "notice also that the curves tend to superimpose as @xmath120 increases .",
    "the ratio @xmath138 is plotted in the main part of the figure , showing that for sufficiently large values of @xmath18 and @xmath120 it converges to a constant value , namely @xmath127 and @xmath83 are proportional . this behavior supports the hypothesis that slow degrees transfer heat to the fast ones and to the reservoir basically in the same way .",
    "this is so because , since fast degrees are thermalized with the reservoirs they affect the slow ones similarly to what the thermal baths do , namely absorbing heat .",
    "[ a1 ]    let us see how these findings fit into the scenario with two degrees coexisting at different ( effective ) temperatures .",
    "this framework implies that statistical independence is retained and thermalization does not occur between them .",
    "the question is why .",
    "the most obvious explanation would be that slow and fast degrees do not effectively interact ; they are _ insulated _ , in some sense .",
    "however , the above experiment has shown that this is not the case , since heat is transferred from slow degrees to the fast ones and to the reservoir basically in the same way .",
    "hence , statistical independence must have a different origin .",
    "a possible explanation is the following : let us consider two separated domains at time @xmath139 ( left part of fig .",
    "( [ due_interf ] ) ) .",
    "they successively merge at the later time @xmath140 , releasing some heat @xmath141 to the fast degrees surrounding the coalescence event .",
    "this excess heat will outflow to the bath on the microscopic time @xmath39 .",
    "after the event the slow degrees which have originally released the heat are annihilated .",
    "the surviving ones are left unmodified by this process , and hence retain their original properties . in summary , if energy release is always accompanied by annihilation , the heat transferred between fast and slow components up to a certain time was provided by interfaces that do not exist any more , while those still surviving have never been involved . notice that , writing @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the heat released to the reservoir , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) one has @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the number of slow degrees .",
    "this shows that @xmath146 is proportional to the decrease of @xmath145 , and this is consistent with the hypotheses that heat release and annihilation are deeply related processes .",
    "having shown that fast degrees absorb the excess heat released by the interfaces it remains to be shown that this process does not spoil the thermal properties of the fast degrees , preserving in this way the statistical independence .",
    "this is expected because bulk degrees are able to thermalize among themselves and with the reservoirs in a microscopic time @xmath147 , making their thermal properties irrespective of the presence of interfaces .",
    "if this is true , one might predict that when two coarsening systems quenched to different temperatures @xmath0 , @xmath148 are put in contact , heat flows from the fast components of the hotter system to those of the colder .",
    "moreover , fluctuations of heat exchanged between fast modes should be similar to those observed in stationary systems and , in particular , governed by the fluctuation principle ( [ fluc ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , we should verify eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) but with @xmath116 in place of @xmath3 . however , we recall that eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) is supposed to hold in the large-@xmath84 domain where boundary terms can be neglected , similarly to what happens in eq .",
    "( [ qdifff ] ) . in this regime",
    "the number of bulk spins is much larger than that of the interfacial ones and so @xmath149 is negligible with respect to @xmath116 .",
    "then , if the thermal properties of fast degrees is unaffected by the presence of the slow ones one should be able to verify the fr ( [ fluc ] ) for the _ whole _ heat transferred @xmath3 .    in order to study this ,",
    "we have designed an experiment similar to the one discussed above . however",
    "now we quench system 1 to @xmath150 , while 2 is in equilibrium at @xmath151 . in fig .",
    "[ a3 ] we compare the probability distribution @xmath152 of the heat @xmath3 in this experiment , with the one @xmath153 measured in the experiment described in sec .",
    "( [ two ] ) where the samples are again in contact with the same baths at @xmath154 , but they are both stationary .",
    "the two distributions have a zig - zag shape .",
    "this is not due to a lack of statistics but is a genuine feature that we will discuss later .",
    "notice that , at any finite time , the positive tail of @xmath152 is fatter than that of @xmath153 .",
    "this is due to the extra heat flowing from the coarsening system 1 to the stationary sample 2 , which is produced by the reduction of the interface density , similarly to the case with @xmath155 discussed above ( see fig .",
    "[ a1 ] ) . besides this",
    ", one observes that the two distributions tend to merge in the large time limit when all boundary terms become negligible and slow degrees are sufficiently few .",
    "we made this observation more quantitative by plotting , in one inset of fig .",
    "[ a1 ] , the _ distance _ @xmath156 between the two probability densities , defined in eq .",
    "( [ distance ] ) , which decreases in a power - law way .",
    "the merging of the two distributions indicates that the thermal properties of the fast degrees are left unchanged by the presence of the slow ones . as a further check we consider the validity of eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) : after having verified that the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) is well fitted by @xmath157=k(\\tau)(1/t_2 - 1/t_1)q_{1,2}$ ] for all the values of @xmath84 , we have plotted the _ slope _ @xmath158 in the inset of the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "one sees that @xmath158 converges to @xmath159 when @xmath75 is increased , as expected .",
    "let us now come back to the zig - zag feature of the distributions of fig .",
    "[ a3 ] . which can be explained as follows .",
    "let us consider the 4-steps microscopic heat transfer process ( [ scheme ] ) . according to our operative definition of @xmath3 , one measures @xmath160 or @xmath96 after the first or after the fourth step , respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath3 is always a multiple of 2 , in this model . in the situations considered in this section spin 2",
    "is part of an extended system in contact with the reservoir at @xmath110 .",
    "this system is in a coarsening stage , where the up - down symmetry is not globally broken .",
    "however locally , the neighborhood of spin 2 has almost surely a broken symmetry character , if time is large enough .",
    "indeed , this spin will almost surely be located in the bulk of a magnetized domain .",
    "suppose that symmetry is broken around the @xmath161 direction .",
    "in this situation the probability of finding the first or the last configuration of the process ( [ scheme ] ) is much higher than that of finding the other . since the final time @xmath162 over which the heats are collected is not correlated to the spin configurations , one has a much higher probability that @xmath3 is a multiple of 4 than that it is not",
    "this explains the zig - zag behavior where values of @xmath3 which are multiples of 4 are enhanced .     computed in a stationary state with @xmath163 , @xmath151 and in the setup where 2 is ( quasi)-stationary at @xmath151 while 1 is aging after a quench to @xmath163 .",
    "the system size is @xmath164 .",

    "coarsening systems are prototypical models which exhibit a non trivial aging behavior where two classes of degrees of freedom with different properties can be identified and studied to some extent .",
    "they are then particularly suited to understand the issue of thermal exchanges in aging states and the related concept of effective temperatures . in this perspective ,",
    "in this paper we have studied numerically the heat flows occurring in an ising model quenched below the critical temperature . in order to do that we have first developed an algorithm to quantify the heat transferred between two parts of a system , and we have subsequently used this tool in a series of numerical experiments designed as to detect the heat fluxes occurring between the two kinds of degrees existing in the coarsening system .",
    "our results fit into a scenario where fast components thermalize with the reservoirs and act themselves as baths where interfaces can temporary store their excess energy when annihilation events occur .",
    "the mechanism is such that , after a microscopic time of order @xmath39 , the statistical properties of both fast and slow modes are left unchanged .",
    "this guarantees that the two kind of degrees may remain statistically independent , as shown analytically in a soluble limit in @xcite .",
    "once a thermodynamic interpretation of the effective temperature ( in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is agreed upon ( let us mention however that our results do not speak about the consistent interpretation of @xmath4 as a genuine thermodynamic temperature ) our results help to explain why a couple of different effective temperature can be sustained indefinitely . at variance to what is naively expected , this does not occur because the two classes of degrees are thermally insulated , or not effectively interacting . on the contrary , heat is exchanged between them much in the same way as it is exchanged with the baths . the mechanism",
    "whereby this occurs , nevertheless , is such to preserve the statistical properties of the two kind of modes .",
    "we have given support to this allegation by proving that the gallavotti - cohen fr ( [ fluc ] ) is obeyed in the asymptotic domain also when aging occurs in systems at different temperatures .",
    "let us stress here that @xmath0 and @xmath1 entering eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) are in this case the temperatures of the thermal baths .",
    "the presence of @xmath4 does not play an appreciable role in our experiments because slow degrees do not contribute significantly to the heat exchanged @xmath3 , which is dominated by the contribution of the fast spins .",
    "interestingly , @xmath4 might be expected to enter the fr @xcite if only the heat exchanged by slow degrees was considered , ( namely subtracting away the dominant contribution provided by the fast ones in a specially designed experiment ) .",
