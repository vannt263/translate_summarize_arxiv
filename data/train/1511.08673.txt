    "correlated and frustrated electronic ( spin ) systems have recently observed a major surge in research activities due to the inherently rich fundamental physics involved in their understanding as well as their potential for practical applications .",
    "vanadium spinel oxides belong to one such family of systems which , of late , has become the centre of attraction for studying phenomena involving the competition among various degrees of freedom , like spin , orbital and lattice in presence of both coulomb correlation and geometric frustration @xcite .",
    "these compounds with chemical formula av@xmath2o@xmath11 can be broadly divided into three categories on the basis of a - site cation properties , namely ; ( i ) a site non - magnetic ( i.e. a= zn , mg , cd ) , ( ii ) a - site magnetic but orbitally inactive ( i.e. a = mn , co ) , ( iii ) a - site magnetic and orbitally active ( i.e. a = fe ) . as v ion is both magnetic and orbitally active , the additional magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom of a site ion bring in a very complex and rich physics with competing spin , lattice and orbital interactions ( in some cases also spin - orbit interactions ) in these systems .",
    "the competition among different degrees of freedom then manifests itself in several structural ( accompanied often by orbital ordering ) and magnetic transitions as observed experimentally in these systems .",
    "fev@xmath2o@xmath11 is a rare example among the vanadium spinel oxides where both fe and v cations are magnetic as well as orbitally active .",
    "this system is reported to show three successive structural transitions ( cubic@xmath12 tetragonal@xmath13 orthorhombic @xmath12 tetragonal ) and two magnetic transitions ( paramagnetic ( pm ) @xmath12 collinear ferrimagnetic ( fim ) @xmath12 non - collinear ferrimagnetic ( nc - fim ) ) as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "another example is mnv@xmath2o@xmath11 which has a - site magnetic but not orbitally active .",
    "this compound shows one structural ( cubic@xmath12 tetragonal ) and two magnetic ( pm @xmath12 fim @xmath12 nc - fim ) transitions @xcite .",
    "znv@xmath2o@xmath11 can be the third example with a nonmagnetic and non - orbitally active a - site ion which undergoes one structural ( cubic@xmath12 tetragonal ) and one magnetic ( pm @xmath12 antiferromagnetic ) transition @xcite .",
    "although most of the structural and magnetic transitions ( along with the magnetic orders ) have been unambiguously established by various experiments , the orbital order which often accompanies the structural transitions are still a matter of intense investigation and continuous debate @xcite .",
    "the debate is mostly centered around the orbital order of the v sites in these spinels .",
    "v ion in its @xmath14 valence state has two @xmath15-electrons in the orbitally degenerate @xmath16 levels . in most of these systems ,",
    "low temperature structure is tetragonal and vo@xmath17 octahedra have tetragonal compression accompanied often by a trigonal distortion . due to the tetragonal compression along z - direction the energy of the d@xmath18 orbital is lowered and it is occupied by one d electron .",
    "however , the second d electron has a choice : occupy either d@xmath5 or d@xmath6 orbital or a combination of these two .",
    "there are various possible scenarios proposed for the orbital order in these systems based on the symmetry of the tetragonal phase and the type of dominant interactions .",
    "some of the proposed orbital ordering models include ferro - orbital ordering of complex orbitals such as d@xmath5@xmath19id@xmath6 with dominant spin - orbit interaction@xcite , a - type antiferro - orbital ordering of real orbitals d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 alternating along c - direction where so interaction is not considered strong@xcite and an orbital ordering of real and complex orbitals for systems with intermediate strength of so interaction@xcite etc .",
    "also , experiments have not yet been able to establish the orbital order unambiguously in these systems as there are measurements reported in the literature supporting each of these models .",
    "very recently , the doped variants of fev@xmath2o@xmath11 and mnv@xmath2o@xmath11 ( i.e. fe@xmath0mn@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3(@xmath20 ) ) have been studied experimentally by kawaguchi et al.@xcite and d. choudhuri et al.@xcite where a detail magnetic and structural phase diagram has been obtained .",
    "kawaguchi et al .",
    "have also analyzed the orbital ordering at fe and v sites in fe@xmath0mn@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3for different doping ( x ) on the basis of local jahn - teller distortions of feo@xmath11 tetrahedra and vo@xmath17 octahedra respectively . from their analysis ,",
    "the authors have predicted that in the range 0@xmath21 , the d@xmath9 orbital should order at all fe sites and at v sites a long range ferro - orbital ordering of complex orbitals of the type d@xmath5@xmath19id@xmath6 should be present . on the other hand , for the range 0.6 @xmath22",
    ", it is the d@xmath10 orbital that orders at fe sites and an a - type antiferro - orbital order should exist at v sites where within each ab - plane it is ferro - orbital order of either d@xmath5 or d@xmath6 but along c - direction it is antiferro ( i.e. alternate arrangement of d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 orbital ) .",
    "however , a very recent xmcd measurements reveal that though there is a difference in the occupied orbital state in fev@xmath2o@xmath11 and mnv@xmath2o@xmath11 , the orbitals that order ( at v sites ) in fev@xmath2o@xmath11 as well as in mnv@xmath2o@xmath11 are not complex but real orbitals @xcite . even though the observation of orbital order consisting of real orbitals rather than complex ones corroborates the previous theoretical predictions reported in the literature on these two systems@xcite ,",
    "the exact nature of orbital ordering proposed from theory and experiments differ significantly . in view of these disagreements regarding the orbital state of parent compounds and also to study the effect of doping , we have decided to investigate the issue of orbital order in the whole range of x in fe@xmath0mn@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath11 from a theoretical perspective using ab - initio density functional theory calculations .",
    "we have performed ab - initio density functional theory calculations within various approximations such as gga , gga+u and gga+u+so for fe@xmath0mn@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3with x=0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1 .",
    "the experimental structures of parent and doped compounds have been taken from experiments @xcite . in case of x=0.25 and x=0.75",
    "we have taken the available experimental structural data for x=0.2 and x=0.8 and optimized the structure as described below .",
    "the optimization ( volume , c / a ratio and oxygen positions ) has been done by using perdew - burke - ernzerof generalized gradient approximation ( pbe - gga ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite , within the full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code @xcite .",
    "we have used the package 2droptimize available within wien2k package for the optimization of volume and c / a ratio . for this purpose",
    "we have considered nine different volumes around the experimental volume and for each volume nine c / a ratios were considered . during the optimization involving these 81 structures , the free internal parameters ( here oxygen positions )",
    "were also optimized .",
    "final optimized structural parameters were obtained by the analysis of the following data ; ( i ) energy vs. c / a for each volume , ( ii ) energy vs. volume ( with optimized c / a ) and ( iii ) c / a vs. volume .",
    "each curve was then fit to 3rd , 4th and 5th order of polynomial and the lattice constants a and c were calculated from the best fit .",
    "we have listed some optimized structural parameters for x = 0 , 0.5 and 0.75 in table i which we have used for our calculations reported here . we have considered the muffin - tin radii of 2.00 , 1.95 , 1.65 a.u for fe(mn ) , v and o respectively .",
    "the plane wave cutoff rk@xmath23 was set to 8.0 for all calculations and the number of @xmath24 points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ( bz ) were taken to be 60 for x = 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 72 for x = 0.75 , 1 .",
    "the expansion of the radial wavefunction in spherical harmonics was considered up to angular momentum quantum number @xmath25 .",
    "we also performed calculations including the correlation effects arising from the d electrons of fe / mn and v. for this , we have used a self - interaction corrected ( sic ) gga+u",
    "@xcite approximation which takes into account the on - site coulomb interaction u and removes the self - coulomb and self exchange correlation energy .",
    "spin - orbit ( so ) coupling is included by the second variational method @xcite with scalar relativistic wavefunctions .",
    "all the calculations were performed for the collinear ferrimagnetic spin arrangement of fe / mn and v ions .",
    "wannier90 @xcite and wien2wannier @xcite ( the interface program between wien2k and wannier90 ) were used to fit the bands around fermi level by localized wannier orbitals and to analyze the band characters in terms of these orbitals .",
    "on the basis of symmetry of the crystal structure and observed orbital ordering in our calculations , we divide these compounds into two groups ( i ) x=0 , 0.25 , 0.5 which we refer to as x@xmath40.6 case as crystal symmetry remains same in the range 0@xmath4x@xmath40.6 , ( ii ) x=0.75 , 1 which we refer to as x@xmath26 case where symmetry is different from the former one .",

    "our optimized structures also have the same symmetry although the local trigonal and tetragonal distortions as well as the c / a ratios differ slightly . in table",
    "i we compared the structural parameters of experiment and optimized one for x=0.5 case .",
    "we clearly observe from table i that the local trigonal and tetragonal distortions at feo@xmath11 tetrahedron and vo@xmath17 octahedron as well as the c / a ratio of the optimized structure are comparable and more importantly have the same signs ( i.e. compression or elongation along a particular direction ) as the experimental one .",
    "therefore , we discuss below the results obtained with these optimized structures .",
    "we note that we have also performed calculations with the corresponding experimental structures where it is available and checked that our both experimental and optimized structures give consistent results .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     * gga+u+so results : * we also performed calculations including so interaction to study its effect on orbital ordering and whether there are complex orbitals involved in the ordering process .",
    "however , we did not observe any significant effect of so interaction in this case either .",
    "the calculated orbital moments are also found to be very small as listed in table ii .",
    "v orbital moment is found to be about 0.07@xmath28 which is much smaller than that found for x=0.5 case ( i.e. 0.22@xmath28 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of kawaguchi et al . that above x=0.6 the orbital moments should decrease .",
    "the observation of low orbital moment is also consistent with the recent xmcd measurements and previous theoretical calculations on mnv@xmath2o@xmath11@xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the orbital ordering involves only real orbitals in this case as well .",
    "we have performed first principles density functional theory calculations in a series of compounds fe@xmath0mn@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3with x = 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1 where experimental measurements related to orbital ordering have recently been reported .",
    "we investigated in detail the orbital ordering of fe and v d - orbitals in these systems from our calculations under various approximations such gga , gga+u and gga+u+so .",
    "we have also performed a detail analysis of long range orbital order by calculating the wannier orbital projections of the occupied d - bands and plotting those orbitals in real space lattice . on the basis of the observed orbital order from our calculations we divide these systems into two classes ; one which includes the compounds x=0,0.25 and 0.5 and the other includes x=0.75 and 1 . in the former ,",
    "we observe d@xmath9 orbital order at fe sites while in the later it is d@xmath10 orbital ordering . as far as v sites are concerned , in the former case ,",
    "d@xmath18 orbital is found to be present at all v sites as expected and the second orbital that is ordered has equal contribution from d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 ( i.e a linear superposition of the type d@xmath5+d@xmath6 or d@xmath5-d@xmath6 ) . in successive ab - planes along c",
    "- direction the composition of this orbital alternates between d@xmath5+d@xmath6 and d@xmath5-d@xmath6 .",
    "we further observe that real orbitals , not complex ones as had been claimed in some reports earlier@xcite , are involved in the orbital ordering process .",
    "this observation is consistent with the recent xmcd measurements on the parent compounds@xcite . for x=0.75 and 1 ,",
    "we observe , apart from d@xmath18 orbital being present at all v sites , the second electron occupies preferentially either d@xmath5 or d@xmath6 in successive ab - planes as one moves along c - direction which is often referred to as a - type orbital ordering in the literature .",
