    "for example , lepage and brodsky studied the pion - photon tff by neglecting the transverse distributions ( @xmath11-distribution ) of the constitute quarks , and resulted in the well - known asymptotic prediction  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath12 tends to be a constant ( @xmath13 ) for the asymptotic pion da @xmath14 .",
