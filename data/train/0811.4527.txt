    "among the most striking discrepancies between classical and quantum physics are the nonclassical correlations between the subsystems of a compound system  @xcite . in general , a common description of all subsystems is needed for describing the properties and the evolution of the compound system  @xcite .",
    "these nonclassical correlations are usually called entanglement .",
    "today , entanglement is considered to be the key resource of the vast fields of quantum information processing , quantum computation , and quantum technology , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent examples of entangled states are the bell states , which maximally violate bell - type inequalities which are valid for classical correlations  @xcite .    on the other hand , in the field of quantum optics nonclassical effects have been studied over many years , which are related to negativities in the glauber ",

    "a state is considered to be classical , if the @xmath0 function has the properties of a classical propability distribution .",
    "if this is not the case , then the state is called a nonclassical one  @xcite .",
    "recently , negativities of @xmath0 could be experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "entanglement and the nonclassical effects reflected by the negativities in @xmath0 appear to be related in some form .",
    "when mixing two radiation fields by a beam splitter , nonclassicality in one of the input channel is necessary for the generation of entanglement in the output channels  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", even an entangled composite state has negativities in the @xmath0 function , which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for entanglement .",
    "a detailed understanding of the structure of entangled quantum states is a topic of fundamental interest .",
    "the idea of the decomposition of entangled states into a best approximation by a separable state and a remaining entangled state delivered further insights into the nature of entanglement , see  @xcite . it has been shown in  @xcite , that any quantum state can be given in terms of local pseudo - mixtures , here and in the following denoted by the quasi - probability distribution @xmath1 , that visualizes entanglement .",
    "an interesting consequence is in this context , that local measurements are sufficient to describe any quantum system completely  @xcite , including entanglement .    in the present contribution",
    "we reconsider the representation of entangled states by quasi - probabilities , @xmath1 , in terms of separable states .",
    "this representation is compared with the glauber  sudarshan representation of nonclassical states by classical ones .",
    "we give an explicit construction scheme for @xmath1 for arbitrary quantum states , which opens the possibility of reconstructing these quasi - probabilities from experimental data .",
    "however , the quasi - distributions resulting from the bare reconstruction are not unique .",
    "the identification of entanglement would require to inspect an infinite set of quasi - probabilities . to overcome this problem is the main aim of our paper .",
    "starting from the problem that @xmath1 is not unique , we derive an optimization procedure to obtain @xmath2 , representing a quasi - probability of a given state whose negativities are properly minimized .",

    "let us start with the well known glauber  sudarshan representation of a single - mode quantum state as an example for quasi - probabilities in statistical quantum physics .",

    "a state is nonclassical , if @xmath0 fails to be represented as a classical propability distribution @xmath7 , see  @xcite .",
    "thus , a nonclassical state @xmath8 has negativities in its @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the only classical pure state ( with a non - negative distribution @xmath0 ) is the coherent state  @xcite .",
    "thus the implication of eq .",
    "( [ gsdec ] ) is , that any quantum state @xmath8 can be given solely in terms of classical states @xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned above it has been shown in  @xcite , that any quantum state for finite hilbert spaces can be given as @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being separable states and @xmath13 .",

    "there are two items describing the failure of an entangled state @xmath18 to be a convex combination of separable states . for the latter it is not allowed to use coefficient with both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , only finite systems need to be considered to characterize entanglement completely .",
    "hence , it is not a restriction , if one assumes a finite , but arbitrary dimensional hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "thus , any quantum state can be given as @xmath22 with the quasi - probabilities @xmath23 the negative quasi - propabilities can be considered to be the key signature of entanglement .",
    "this leads us to the question , how to obtain the quasi - probability distribution @xmath1  in particular for entangled states .",
    "we will start to consider two quantum systems represented by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , given by the bases @xmath26 for each system .",

    "it is sufficient to show how to write any pure state @xmath53 solely in terms of separable states .",
    "for any pure state one can obtain the schmidt decomposition  @xcite @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the schmidt rank @xmath56 , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 being orthonormal in @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . under the assumption @xmath59 , we can write @xmath60 the first sum , @xmath61 , is a separable state .",
    "the second sum depends on the terms ( for @xmath62 ) @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "in this case we obtain @xmath84 , with negativities for entanglement .",
    "furthermore it is obvious that negativities of @xmath0 are not necessarily due to entanglement .",

    "therefore entanglement is due to negativities in the distribution @xmath106 .    the other way around , as it was known for two decades  @xcite , any separable state can be given by a classical distribution , @xmath107 .",
    "thus a single non - negative quasi - distribution @xmath1 is sufficient to demonstrate the entanglement of a given quantum state .",
    "the advantage of an optimized quasi - probability @xmath2 is that it clearly uncovers entanglement and separability by its negativities and its non - negativity , respectively .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath108 is finite dimensional , @xmath109 .",
