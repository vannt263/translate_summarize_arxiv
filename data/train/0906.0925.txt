    "the wigner phase space representation of quantum mechanics  @xcite is a very useful and enlightening approach .",
    "it is of practical interest in the description of a broad range of physical phenomena , including quantum transport processes in quantum optics  @xcite and condensed matter  @xcite , quantum chaos  @xcite , quantum complexity  @xcite , decoherence  @xcite , quantum computation  @xcite , and quantum tomography  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the phase space approach brings out most clearly the differences and similarities between classical and quantum mechanics and offers unique insights into the classical limit of quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "the wigner phase space distribution function of a quantum state described by a state vector @xmath3 reads @xmath4 ( for the sake of simplicity , we consider the case of a single particle moving along a straight line ) .",
    "the wigner function provides a pictorial phase - space representation of the abstract notion of a quantum state and allows us to compute the quantum mechanical expectation values of observables in terms of phase space - averages .    a different",
    ", almost unknown phase space approach is based on an old paper by fermi  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by fermi , the state of a quantum system may be defined in two completely equivalent ways : by its wave function @xmath5 or by measuring a physical quantity @xmath0 . given the measurement outcome @xmath6 , @xmath7",
    "is obtained as solution of the eigenvalue equation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . on the other hand , given the wave function @xmath7 it is always possible to find an operator @xmath0 such that @xmath10 using the polar decomposition @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real functions [ @xmath14 for any @xmath15 , it is easy to check that identity ( [ goperator ] ) is fulfilled by taking @xmath16 ^ 2+\\hbar^2 \\frac{r''(x)}{r(x)}. \\label{gfoperator}\\ ] ] equation ( [ goperator ] ) implies that the corresponding physical quantity @xmath0 takes the value @xmath17 . the equation @xmath18 ^ 2+\\hbar^2 \\frac{r''(x)}{r(x)}=0 \\label{gfimplicit}\\ ] ] defines a curve in the two - dimensional phase space . in other words , as expected from heisenberg uncertainty principle , we can not identify a quantum particle by means of a phase - space point @xmath19 but we need a curve , @xmath2 .",
    "note that it is also possible to write equation ( [ gfimplicit ] ) in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the particle mass , @xmath22 the madelung s velocity  @xcite , and @xmath23 the so - called quantum - mechanical potential  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ ppmfermi ] ) locates two points , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , in the phase space for any @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the phase space fermi function @xmath0 and the wigner function @xmath1 are at first sight unrelated .",
    "in particular , for the fermi function there is no interpretation in terms of quasiprobabilities as for the wigner function . on the other hand , for a gaussian wave packet",
    "the @xmath2 curve is an ellipse of area @xmath29",
    "@xcite and coincides with the phase - space contour level along which @xmath30 , with @xmath31 equal to the maximum value of @xmath32 .",
    "different contour levels of @xmath32 correspond to different `` equipotential curves '' @xmath33 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that a similar relation exists when the gaussian shape of the wave packet is modified , provided the wave packet remains peaked .",
    "finally , we will comment on the significance of our results in the context of semiclassical approximations of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us first consider the gaussian packet @xmath34 in this case wigner function ( [ wignerfunction ] ) reads @xmath35 while the fermi function is given by @xmath36 it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ wgaussian ] ) and ( [ gfgaussian ] ) that for gaussian packet ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) we have @xmath37 therefore , there is a one to one correspondence between the `` equipotential curves '' @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 . in particular",
    ", the @xmath41 curve coincides with the curve @xmath42 , with @xmath43 maximum value of @xmath32 .",
    "we now discuss the relation between the wigner and the fermi function when the wave packet is peaked but not gaussian . assuming a smooth , regular behavior of the packet around its maximum",
    ", we choose the analytic expression @xmath44 $ ] , with @xmath45 polynomial [ chosen so that @xmath46 for any @xmath15 and @xmath47 normalization constant which is irrelevant for our purposes , while @xmath13 is a polynomial . the wigner function",
    "is then given by the fourier transform ( [ wignerfunction ] ) of @xmath48 \\\\ \\\\ \\times \\ , e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left [ s\\left(x+\\frac{y}{2}\\right)- s\\left(x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)\\right]}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]      we computed numerically @xmath1 for several functions @xmath45 , @xmath13 and found that it strongly depends on @xmath13 , while the dependence on @xmath45 is weak , as far as the wave packet remains peaked .",
    "therefore , we first focus on the case @xmath50 .",
    "= 8.cm    wigner functions for @xmath51 , namely @xmath52 and several @xmath13",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left plot ) and compared with the corresponding @xmath41 curves ( right plots ) .",
    "even though the wave packets in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with the exception of the top plot [ @xmath53 , corresponding to a squeezed state ] , are far from being gaussian , the @xmath41 curve still provides a rather satisfactory description of size and shape of the wave packet in phase space .    this agreement can be explained by the following argument . if we set @xmath51 and consider the expansion @xmath54 we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the shift theorem of fourier transform implies that , if @xmath57=w_g(x , p),\\ ] ] with @xmath58 fourier transform with respect to the @xmath59-variable , then @xmath60=w_g[x , p - s'(x)].\\ ] ] we can therefore conclude that the wigner function corresponding to wave vector ( [ gaussians ] ) reads @xmath61 = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\hbar }   e^{-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2}{\\delta^2}-\\frac{\\delta^2 [ p - s'(x)]^2}{\\hbar^2}}.\\ ] ] hence connection ( [ wgf ] ) between the wigner and the fermi functions approximately holds around the peak of the wave packet . the rather good agreement between the @xmath41 curve and the contour level @xmath62",
    "is shown in the right plots of fig .",
    "we can conclude that , for peaked packets , the @xmath41 curve is close to an equipotential curve of the wigner function , enclosing a phase space area of the order of planck s constant .",
    "we have seen numerically that the dependence of the wigner function on @xmath45 is weak , as far as the wave packet remains peaked . as an example , we consider @xmath64 , with @xmath65 so that @xmath66 for any @xmath26 , and @xmath63 . for @xmath67",
    "the wave function @xmath68 has a single maximum at @xmath69 and the @xmath41 curve again gives a good representation of the phase - space size and shape of the wave packet ( see the top plots of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath70 the wave function exhibits two maxima at @xmath71 . for @xmath72 the two maxima are well separated . such a  cat state  exhibits non - classical features which impact on the structure of the wigner function ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] bottom left , for @xmath73 ) .",
    "since @xmath74 is the autocorrelation function of @xmath12 , then it reaches its maximum at @xmath69 . on the other hand , the marginal @xmath75 exhibits a minimum at @xmath69 and this is possible thanks to the negative regions of @xmath1 ( the white regions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] bottom left ) . for this cat state",
    "the @xmath41 curve captures the two peaks at @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] bottom right ) but not the non - classical phase - space structures of the wigner function .",
    "the @xmath41 curve is an interesting tool to investigate quantum fluctuations in the semiclassical region .",
    "as far as the wave packet remains peaked , that is , before the ehrenfest time scale  @xcite , its size and phase - space shape can be readily derived from the wave function ( or from a semiclassical approximation of the wave function ) , without computing the whole wigner function . moreover , the distortion of the wave packet is directly related to @xmath77 , that is , to the madelung s velocity .    as a numerical illustration of the capability of the @xmath41 curve to capture relevant features of quantum fluctuations , we follow in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the evolution of the wigner and fermi functions for the quartic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath78 here , @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the frequency of the harmonic part of the oscillator and @xmath81 gives the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "this model has been widely investigated in the context of quantum to classical transition  @xcite and also used to explain important experimental results  @xcite .",
    "model ( [ eq : quartic ] ) is integrable , see refs .",
    "@xcite for the evolution of classical and quantum phase - space distributions .",
    "details on the computation of the fermi function are given in the appendix .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the evolution the wigner function with the evolution of the @xmath41 fermi function , for the quartic oscillator , starting from an initial gaussian wave packet @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "it is clear that , as far as the wave packet remains peaked , the @xmath41 curve reproduces both size and shape of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is the case for times smaller than the ehrenfest time scale @xmath84  @xcite , until which the centroid of the wave packet follows a classical trajectory . for longer times the wigner function develops interference fringes , while the @xmath41 function splits into several curves .",
    "we point out that the @xmath2 function ( [ ppmfermi ] ) singles out only two @xmath85-values ( or none ) for any @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , it can not reproduce the whole phase space structure of the wave packet when the wigner function does not exhibit a single peak but a non - monotonous behavior along @xmath85 [ see the bottom plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( left ) ] .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the phase space structure of a peaked wave packet can be satisfactorily described by the @xmath41 fermi curve . in spite of the fact that the wigner and the fermi functions are at first sight two completely unrelated phase space descriptions of quantum mechanics , a link between them exists and",
    "is based on the shift theorem of fourier transform .",
    "such theorem also allows us to understand the shape of the wigner function for perturbed gaussian packets in terms of the madelung s velocity .",
    "our theoretical results , corroborated by numerical simulations for the quartic oscillator model , show that the fermi function is an interesting tool to investigate the phase - space size and shape of quantum fluctuations in the semiclassical regime .",
    "while the fermi function @xmath0 fully determines the state of a quantum system , the extension of the results obtained in this paper to generic states encounters difficulties .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath2 curve is in general not sufficient .",
    "the complete determination of the state of a system requires the extension of this curve to the complex @xmath85-plane .",
    "that is , consideration of the complex values of @xmath87 , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ppmfermi ] ) when @xmath88 , is needed .",
    "we then obtain @xmath89 , @xmath90 , from which the @xmath91 operator ( [ gfoperator ] ) and consequently the wave function @xmath7 are determined .",
    "any phase space description of quantum mechanics necessarily involves features beyond classical intuition : negative quasiprobabilities in the case of the wigner function , complex momenta for the fermi curve .",
    "we consider as initial condition a gaussian state ( coherent state for the harmonic part of the oscillator ) , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the state of the quartic oscillator at time @xmath97 is then given by @xmath98 .",
    "in the coordinate representation , @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the @xmath101-th hermite polynomial .    in order to compute the fermi function , we write @xmath102 , so that @xmath103 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath104 finally , the @xmath41 curve is obtained from ( [ gfimplicit ] ) . note that in computing the derivatives of @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we took advantage of the relation @xmath107 .",
