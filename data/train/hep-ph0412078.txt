    "<S> a simple unitarized quark - meson model , recently applied with success to light and charmed scalar mesons , is shown to encompass adler - type zeros in the amplitude , due to the use of relativistic kinematics in the scattering sector . </S>",
    "<S> these zeros turn out to be crucial for the description of the @xmath0(800 ) resonance , as well as the new charmed scalar mesons @xmath1(2317 ) and @xmath2(2300 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the light scalar mesons are still causing lots of headaches to many theorists as well as experimentalists , despite the growing , yet far from general , consensus that unitarization in some form should represent the necessary setting . </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose of the present short note , we limit ourselves to refer to a recent brief review @xcite , which , albeit voicing mainly our personal view - points , contains many references to work in this field .    </S>",
    "<S> an important contribution to unraveling the conundrum of the light scalar mesons from a data - analysis perspective was recently made by d.  v.  bugg @xcite , in successfully describing elastic @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering as well as the corresponding @xmath5 ( @xmath6(600 ) ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath0(800 ) ) resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the clue to this achievement was the inclusion of the respective adler zeros for these processes directly into the energy - dependent widths contained in the relativistic breit  wigner amplitudes used in the phase - shift fits .    </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath8-matrix zeros below threshold were determined by s.  weinberg @xcite for elastic @xmath3 scattering , elaborating upon consistency conditions among strong - interaction amplitudes derived by s.  l.  adler @xcite for @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 processes , on the basis of pcac . in the case of elastic @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering , </S>",
    "<S> the adler zeros lie at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , which were the values used by d.  v.  bugg .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> as early as in 1986 two of us co - authored a paper @xcite in which , for the first time , a complete light nonet of scalar - meson resonances @xcite was predicted with a simultaneous reasonable description of the corresponding elastic @xmath13-wave meson - meson phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> although the latter coupled - channel model results were obtained without any fit in the scalar sector , its predictions for the resonance pole positions lied very close to the present - day world averages . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , no attempt was made in this work to account for dynamical adler zeros from pcac or ( approximate ) chiral symmetry , besides the use of a physical input pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in a more recent paper @xcite , a simplified yet less model - dependent version of the mentioned coupled - channel approach was employed to fit the @xmath13-wave @xmath4 phase shifts up to 1.6 gev , thereby extracting both the established @xmath0(1430 ) and the now also listed @xmath0(800 ) resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we used the very same modified breit  </S>",
    "<S> wigner formula , with adjusted quark and meson masses , to successfully describe @xcite the couple of just discovered charmed scalar mesons consisting of the very narrow @xmath14(2317 ) @xcite and the broad @xmath15(2300 ) @xcite .    in view of these surprising results , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze here in more detail the behavior of the latter model amplitude below threshold and in the complex - momentum plane ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath16 matrix is , for the @xmath17 scalar case , simply given by @xmath18\\right\\}^{-1 } \\ ; , \\label{bw}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are spherical bessel and neumann functions , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energies of the lowest bare @xmath23 @xmath24 states , @xmath25 is the coupling for @xmath26 quark - pair creation , @xmath27 is the corresponding interaction radius , @xmath28 is the relativistic relative momentum of the two - meson system , and @xmath29 is the associated relativistic reduced mass @xmath30 \\ ; . \\label{mu}\\ ] ] we immediately see @xcite from the latter expression that @xmath29 vanishes at @xmath31 . therefore , at this point below threshold , the factor with @xmath25 in eq .  ( </S>",
    "<S> [ bw ] ) is squashed to zero , so that the amplitude also vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this property was shared by the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nice illustrations of the effect of these kinematical adler - type zeros are the @xmath13-matrix pole trajectories in the complex-@xmath28 plane for @xmath13-wave @xmath32 and @xmath33 scattering ( see the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the parametrization here is slightly different from the one in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as we now scale @xmath25 and @xmath27 with the reduced mass of the @xmath24 system , so as to guarantee rigorous flavor invariance ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that , in the @xmath32 case , the two pole trajectories interchange their roles , so that now it is the bare state which gives rise to the @xmath1(2317 ) instead of the continuum state . however , despite the dramatic change in the trajectories themselves , their end points , corresponding to the value 0.75 ( gev@xmath34 ) of the universal coupling @xmath35 , only suffer a modest shift , which even produces an improved value for the @xmath1(2317 ) mass , viz .  </S>",
    "<S> 2.327 gev . in the @xmath33 case , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories remain qualitatively unaltered , but the predicted @xmath2(2300 ) pole position also improves , i.e. , to @xmath36 gev </S>",
    "<S> . however , the crucial message from the figure appears to be the large effect of the adler - type zeros , indicated by the open circles . </S>",
    "<S> namely , while in the @xmath32 case the relatively distant zeros , located at @xmath37 , allow the lower pole to travel all the way to the upper imaginary-@xmath28 axis , for @xmath33 scattering the nearby zeros at @xmath38 slow down this pole so as to settle above threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> note that these kinematical zeros deviate less than 1% from the theoretical adler zeros . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we get a ( quasi-)bound state in the former case , and a quite broad resonance in the latter , similarly to what happens with the @xmath7 meson ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the @xmath7-pole trajectory ) .    as a final test </S>",
    "<S> , we check what happens to the @xmath7 by removing the adler - type zero . </S>",
    "<S> so we substitute the relativistic reduced mass ( [ mu ] ) by a nonrelativistic one , and then refit @xmath25 , @xmath27 to the @xmath4 phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a somewhat unphysical @xmath39 mev . defining also the relative momentum </S>",
    "<S> nonrelativistically then completely kills the @xmath7 , while the @xmath0(1430 ) still survives . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide a clue to the absence of a light @xmath7 in the analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which a distant , negative @xmath40 gev@xmath41 was used , in contrast with e.g.  the unitarized chiral approaches of ref .  @xcite . </S>"
