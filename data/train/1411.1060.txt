    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) are a rare class of supernovae ( sne ) discovered in wide - field surveys in the past decade .",
    "they are characterized by peak luminosities of 10 - 100 times those of normal core - collapse and type ia sne .",
    "at least two clear subclasses have emerged : slsne that show narrow hydrogen lines in their spectra ( h - rich slsne ) are thought to represent the extreme end of the type iin sn distribution , and are likely powered by interaction with dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the subclass of slsne without hydrogen in their spectra ( h - poor slsne ; e.g. @xcite ) , the mechanism powering the extreme luminosities is not known . as in the case of h - rich slsne",
    ", interaction has also been proposed as the power source , but would require extreme mass loss and should produce narrow lines in the spectra that are not seen @xcite . a central engine model , such as energy injection from a newborn magnetar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has also been proposed .",
    "another possibility , applicable to the slowest - evolving h - poor slsne , is pair - instability sne ( pisne ; @xcite ) , although this interpretation is controversial @xcite .",
    "one way to shed light on the nature of these extreme explosions is to study their progenitor populations .",
    "as all slsne discovered to date are far too distant for direct progenitor detections , in practice this means studying their host galaxy environments as a proxy .",
    "early studies @xcite suggested that slsne were preferentially found in low - luminosity host galaxies .",
    "detailed studies of two individual hosts @xcite revealed metal - poor dwarf galaxies with high specific star formation rates .",
    "these initial trends were investigated in detail with a much larger sample in @xcite , who studied properties of 31 slsn host galaxies , and found that compared to core - collapse sne , the slsne are found in lower - luminosity , lower - mass , higher specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) and lower metallicity environments . instead , their properties were found to be broadly consistent with those of long - duration gamma - ray burst ( lgrb ) host galaxies , though the slsn host galaxies studied were even lower - luminosity and lower - mass than the lgrb host comparison sample .",
    "a complementary approach is to analyze the sub - galactic environments of slsne , i.e. the locations of slsne within their host galaxies .",
    "studies that compare the locations of type ic sne and lgrbs to the sites of star formation , as traced by uv or h@xmath1 emission , show that the supernova locations are strongly correlated with the brightest star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "this is used as evidence that the progenitors of these explosions are young and massive .",
    "type ii sne overall trace the uv emission , though not as strongly as type ib / c sne , suggesting a longer - lived and less massive progenitor @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the locations of short - duration gamma - ray bursts are unassociated with uv light and show significant offsets from the host galaxy centers , suggesting they do not arise from young , massive stars , and are consistent instead with the predictions for a compact object merger progenitor @xcite .",
    "thus , studying the locations of transients within their ( resolved ) host light distributions offers a powerful probe of the progenitor properties .    here , we present the first analysis of the locations of h - poor slsne within their host galaxies .",
    "we present resolved _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging , allowing us to both study the morphologies of slsn host galaxies , as well as the host - sn offsets and positions of the sn locations in the overall light distribution .",
    "we present our targets , _ hst _ observations , data processing techniques and astrometric matching to determine the slsn locations in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "section  [ sec : stats ] describes the comparison samples and statistical techniques , and we present our results in sections  [ sec : galscale ] and [ sec : results ] .",
    "the implications of our findings are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] and summarized in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume a @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the majority of our targets for this study were discovered in the ps1/mds transient search , which operated from late 2009 to early 2014 .",
    "the ps1 telescope on haleakala is a high - etendue wide - field survey instrument with a 1.8-m diameter primary mirror and a @xmath7 diameter field of view imaged by an array of sixty @xmath8 pixel detectors , with a pixel scale of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes the photometric system and broadband filters in detail .",
    "the ps1/mds consists of 10 fields ( each with a single ps1 imager footprint ) observed in @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13with a typical cadence of 3  d in each filter , to a @xmath14 depth of @xmath15 mag ; @xmath16is used near full moon with a typical depth of @xmath17 mag .",
    "the standard reduction , astrometric solution , and stacking of the nightly images are done by the pan - starrs1 image processing pipeline ( ipp ) system @xcite on a computer cluster at the maui high performance computer center . for the transients search ,",
    "the nightly mds stacks were transferred to the harvard fas research computing cluster , where they were processed through a frame subtraction analysis using the photpipe pipeline developed for the supermacho and essence surveys @xcite .",
    "a subset of targets was selected for spectroscopic follow - up , using the blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5-m mmt telescope @xcite , the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8-m gemini telescopes , and the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) and inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) on the 6.5-m magellan telescopes . over the 4 yr of the survey",
    ", we have discovered and spectroscopically confirmed more than 15 h - poor slsne in the ps1/mds data ( @xcite ; r. lunnan et al . 2015 , in preparation ) . due to the modest area and deep detection limit ,",
    "most of the volume of ps1/mds is at high redshift .",
    "the rare slsne in our sample cover @xmath18 .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of ps1/mds was not complete , with follow - up targets selected based on the available light curve and galaxy information .",
    "in particular , the slsne were generally found by some combination of having long observed rise - times and/or being several magnitudes brighter than any apparent host . @xcite",
    "examined in detail to what extent the selection could bias the resulting host galaxy population of the ps1/mds slsn sample , with the conclusion that the strong environmental preferences seen are real and not caused by selection effects .",
    "we obtained _ hst _ observations of the host galaxies of 11 h - poor slsne discovered in the ps1/mds survey through programs go-13022 and go-13326 ( pis : berger and lunnan , respectively ) .",
    "the initial program targeted five slsn host galaxies that were undetected in ground - based data , obtaining both rest - frame uv and rest - frame optical imaging , and the follow - up program added rest - frame uv imaging of the remaining slsn host galaxies in the ps1/mds sample at the time . in addition the host galaxy of slsn ps1 - 10bzj @xcite has archival _ hst _ imaging from the gems survey @xcite .",
    "since the remaining galaxy images by necessity were obtained after the sn explosion , the programs were designed to only include targets where the sne were expected to have faded well below _",
    "detection threshold by the time of the observations , based on the available ps1/mds light curves . for this reason ,",
    "the sample only includes events from the first 2.5 yr of ps1/mds .",
    "all targets are listed in table  [ tab : targets ] .",
    "each galaxy was imaged with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) in a filter corresponding to rest - frame uv emission ( @xmath19 ; f475w , f606w or f814w were used depending on the redshift ) .",
    "we used a standard four - point dither pattern for optimal pixel subsampling ; table  [ tab : hst ] lists the details for each observation , including the effective wavelengths for each filter / redshift combination .",
    "we processed and combined the calibrated and cte - corrected individual images using the astrodrizzle software provided by stsci @xcite , with a final pixscale of 0.025/pixel ( i.e. half the native image scale ) , and a pixfrac value of 0.8 .    in addition , the h - poor slsn ps1 - 11aib was observed in program go-12529 ( pi : soderberg ) , capturing both the late - time light curve of the sn and a final epoch for a host galaxy template .",
    "the f625w filter corresponds to rest - frame uv at a redshift of @xmath20 . in this case , the data are somewhat shallower and we only have two images available per filter , so we do not redrizzle onto a finer grid but keep the original image scale of 0.05/pixel .",
    "we note that what we identify as the host galaxy of ps1 - 11aib is unresolved in the template image , and does not appear to be offset from the sn centroid ( figure  [ fig : hstpix ] ) , so there is a possibility of confusion with lingering sn emission .",
    "the fact that the f625w flux remained constant in the two final epochs ( 220 to 350 rest - frame days past peak ) , as well as the flat f625w - f775w color in the final epoch argues that we are indeed detecting the galaxy , however .",
    "the peculiar transient ps1 - 10afx @xcite was targeted as part of program go-13326 ; however the discovery of a second galaxy along the line of sight combined with the observed sn properties make it likely this object was in fact a lensed sn rather than a slsn @xcite . due to the uncertainties in the nature of this object ,",
    "we do not include it in our analysis here , though we show the _ hst _ image and sn location in appendix  [ sec:10afx ] .",
    "additionally , the slsn ps1 - 10ky @xcite was targeted as part of program go-13022 but its host galaxy was not detected .",
    "it is therefore not included in the discussion , except for where the upper limit is relevant .",
    "in addition to the _ hst _ data from our ps1 sample , a few slsn host galaxies have _ hst _ images available in the public archive from proposal go-13025 ( pi : levan ) . we included available public images covering rest - frame uv of 5 h - poor slsne in our analysis ; targets and details of the observations are listed in tables  [ tab : targets ] and [ tab : hst ] .",
    "as the public objects are generally at lower redshifts than the ps1 sample , most of these objects were imaged with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/uvis ) . unlike acs",
    ", wfc3 images are not currently corrected for cte losses as part of the standard _ hst _ pipeline , and we used the cte correction software available from the wfc3 tools webpage before processing and combining the individual images with astrodrizzle .",
    "again , we used a pixfrac of 0.8 and a final pixscale of half the native image scale , which corresponds to a final scale of 0.0198/pixel .",
    "all final drizzled images are shown in figure  [ fig : hstpix ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the offset technique is limited in comparing the locations of transients to the overall light distribution because many of the slsn host galaxies exhibit irregular , asymmetric structure .",
    "the distance from the flux - weighted center of the galaxy is therefore not necessarily a good indicator of the flux level at the sn position .",
    "for this reason , @xcite developed a morphology - independent technique for quantifying the extent to which sne trace their host light distribution , by determining the pixel on which the sn occurred , and computing the fraction of light in galaxy pixels of lower surface brightness .",
    "a hypothetical population of sources that perfectly tracked the underlying light distribution would follow a uniform distribution : a pixel with twice as much flux would , statistically speaking , be exactly twice as likely to contain a transient .    to calculate this statistic , we first determine which pixels are part of the galaxy .",
    "we fit a gaussian profile to the sky brightness distribution near the galaxy , and determine the 1@xmath21 cutoff level ( equivalent to taking s / n @xmath22 ) .",
    "consecutive pixels above this cutoff level are then defined to be part of the galaxy , and we compute the fraction of light in galaxy pixels fainter than the slsn position . in cases",
    "where the sn position is known to a precision worse than the fwhm of the image , we first convolve the image with a gaussian of the same width as the sn position uncertainty .",
    "the results for each galaxy are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : light_dist ] we show the cumulative distribution of the light fractions of slsn locations , compared to the goods ccsne , lgrbs @xcite and local type ic sne @xcite .",
    "the dashed line marks the expectation of a uniform distribution .",
    "the slsn locations overall are slightly skewed toward brighter pixels , with a median value is 0.65 .",
    "this suggests that slsne are indeed correlated with the uv light of their host galaxies , and are slightly more likely to be found in brighter regions of their host galaxies .",
    "they do not appear to be as strongly correlated with the brightest regions as are lgrbs , which have a median value of 0.88 .",
    "in particular , only one ( @xmath23 ) of the lgrbs in the sample from @xcite are found in regions of fractional brighness @xmath24 , whereas about a quarter of the slsne are found at such low flux values .",
    "the sample sizes are small , however , and statistically we can not rule out either that the slsne come from the same distribution as the lgrbs ( @xmath25 ) , or that they are drawn from a uniform distribution ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the comparison is complicated by the fact that the slsn host galaxies are overall fainter than either of the galaxy populations we are comparing to , and so it is possible the slsn distribution is shifted to lower relative flux values due to the lower - surface brightness parts of the galaxies not being above the noise threshold .",
    "this effect is not likely to be severe , however , since the faintest pixels in the distribution contribute little to the overall _ total _ flux , which is what matters the most for the relative position .",
    "this effect was considered in detail by @xcite when comparing the lgrb sample to the goods ccsne , by experimenting with artificially increasing the noise in their images by a magnitude ( thus losing a larger fraction of the galaxy edge flux ) .",
    "they found that their results were overall unaffected .",
    "it is also worth noting that the galaxies where we find the lowest fractional flux levels at the sn positions are in fact some of the brightest galaxies in the sample : ps1 - 12bqf , ps1 - 11bam and ps1 - 12bmy ( figure  [ fig : hstpix ] ; table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "therefore , the result that some slsne explode in regions of their galaxy with very little uv flux is unlikely to be caused by a surface brightness bias .",
    "another potential bias arises due to that the contrast between a typical slsn and its host galaxy is several magnitudes greater than that between a typical ccsn and its host . as a result ,",
    "the slsne are relatively easier to detect in the brightest regions of their host galaxies , whereas the ccsn sample may be missing events in the bright galaxy cores .",
    "@xcite examined this effect in the goods sample , and estimated that the fraction of central sne missed in the goods sample was @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , the low - z type ic sn sample @xcite appears to trace the brightest regions of their hosts at least as strongly as the slsne do .",
    "thus , sn - host contrast is unlikely to be affecting the comparison on a significant level .     ,",
    "both the offset distribution and the fractional flux distribution of slsne suggest that their locations are correlated with the uv light and hence with recent star formation activity .",
    "this is further evidence that slsne come from massive stars , as is also seen by their associations with star - forming galaxies in general , and high ssfrs in particular @xcite . while their locations are statistically consistent with those of lgrbs , the slsne appear to not be as strongly correlated with the brightest regions of their host galaxies as the lgrbs are ( figure  [ fig : light_dist ] ) .",
    "since a stronger correlation with star formation tracers is generally interpreted as evidence for a younger and more massive progenitor population @xcite , the simplest interpretation is that slsn progenitors are older / less massive stars than lgrb progenitors .",
    "we note that recently , @xcite have argued that slsne result from more massive stars than lgrbs ; our result of slsn locations is potentially at odds with this interpretation . instead ,",
    "as we argued in @xcite , the host galaxy properties seem to lead to the conclusion that the progenitors require low metallicity , potentially as a requirement for a magnetar remnant .",
    "while the locations of slsne may not be more strongly correlated with star formation activity than those of ordinary core - collapse sne , the fact remains that their overall host environments are strikingly different .",
    "our results can also be interpreted to mean that the most important environmental factor for producing a slsn is something different than the progenitor mass alone .",
    "one such factor could be metallicity , as h - poor slsne are generally found in low - metallicity galaxies @xcite . in addition , several proposed models for slsne are consistent with a low metallicity preference , either directly in the case of pisn models , or indirectly in the case of models that require a rapidly rotating progenitor , such as the magnetar model @xcite .",
    "a low - metallicity requirement could explain why some slsne appear to explode in regions away from the most intense star formation , especially in the more massive galaxies in our sample .",
    "in particular it is worth noting that in all cases where the slsn exploded in what looks like an ordinary disk galaxy ( ps1 - 12bqf in the _ hst _ sample , and the lower - redshift ptf11rks and mls121104 in @xcite ) , the sn location is in the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "the fact that our sample is dominated by irregular dwarf galaxies could explain why a potential metallicity preference is not reflected as a preference for large offsets in the overall distribution .    while metallicity is one possible option ( and one that is often invoked also to explain the environmental preferences of lgrbs ) , it is not the only possibility .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the host galaxies of both broad - lined type ic sne and lgrbs have high stellar mass and star formation densities , compared to sdss galaxies of similar masses , and we find that slsn host galaxies show the same trend ( figure  [ fig : sfr_sigma ] ) .",
    "since this trend can not be explained by a simple metallicity preference , @xcite instead argue the key factor may be that massive binary progenitor systems can form more efficiently in regions of dense star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed a dynamical origin for slsne , as the result of runaway collisions in dense star clusters .",
    "if this is the dominant channel for producing slsne , however , it would be difficult to explain our result that some fraction of slsne explode well away from the brightest regions of star formation .    in the context of the interaction - driven model for slsne , the natural comparison sample would be the h - rich slsne , since these do show clear signs of interaction in their spectra .",
    "no similar study of the locations of this class has yet been carried out , unfortunately , though their overall environments appear to be less extreme than those of h - poor slsne @xcite .",
    "for interaction - driven sne in general , @xcite examined the locations of 26 type iin sne , and found that they overall traced the uv light distribution , but was not correlated with ongoing star formation as traced by h@xmath1 .",
    "this result is perhaps surprising , as type iin sne are thought to have massive progenitors such as luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ; e.g. @xcite ) , whereas the type iin locations would suggest similar progenitor masses as ordinary type iip sne .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that both the observed isolated locations of lbvs and the locations of type iin sne are naturally explained in a scenario where lbvs are the product of binary evolution , with a significant fraction being kicked from its birth cluster when the companion goes supernova .",
    "this illustrates how other factors than progenitor mass can have a significant impact on the observed locations of sn subtypes , and that the different correlations between sn locations and uv light between different populations need not be due to a simple mass difference if binary progenitor models are considered .",
    "we have carried out the first study of the sub - galactic environments of h - poor slsne , using resolved rest - frame uv imaging from _ hst _ and precise sn locations .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    * the host galaxies of h - poor slsne are generally irregular dwarf galaxies : about half show asymmetric morphology or multiple peaks , and there is a distinct lack of grand - design spiral galaxies compared to ccsn host galaxies in the same redshift range .",
    "* slsn host galaxies are compact , with a median half - light radius of 0.9  kpc .",
    "the median sfr surface density , as derived from the uv flux , is 0.1  @xmath28 .",
    "slsn host galaxies exhibit high sfr surface densities for their stellar masses compared to host galaxies of local ccsne . *",
    "the median offset between slsne and their hosts is @xmath29 1  kpc .",
    "the normalized offset distribution is consistent with those of other types of transients with massive star progenitors , with a median normalized offset of one half - light radius . * the locations of h - poor slsne",
    "are correlated with the uv light .",
    "we find that their distribution is intermediate between those of lgrbs ( which trace the brightest regions of their hosts ) and a uniform distribution , and can not be distinguished statistically from either with the current sample size .",
    "the galaxy properties derived from the _ hst _ images support the overall picture that h - poor slsne explode in host galaxies that are overall different from core - collapse sn hosts , and that share many similarities with lgrb host galaxies .",
    "both samples are primarily found in irregular galaxies , with similar typical sizes .",
    "in addition , both are found in galaxies with high star formation surface densities .",
    "thus , the galaxy - scale properties support the results of @xcite that similar environmental factors are necessary for stars to end their lives as either a h - poor slsn or a lgrb .    at the same time",
    ", our study of the sub - galactic locations of slsne indicates that the _ local _ environments of slsne and lgrbs may be different , with slsne being less biased toward the brightest regions of their host galaxies ( although a larger sample size is necessary to distinguish them statistically ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as slsn progenitors being less massive and longer - lived stars than lgrb progenitors , contrary to recent claims that slsne are the very first stars to explode in a starburst @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with the recent results of @xcite , however , who find that the ism column densities along slsn lines of sight are on the low end of what is seen in lgrbs , also suggesting that they trace different local environments .",

    "<S> we present _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_)rest - frame ultraviolet imaging of the host galaxies of 16 hydrogen - poor superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) , including 11 events from the pan - starrs medium deep survey . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the superb angular resolution of _ hst _ , we characterize the galaxies morphological properties , sizes and star formation rate ( sfr ) densities . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the supernova ( sn ) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometric matching , and measure physical and host - normalized offsets , as well as the sn positions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the host galaxies of h - poor slsne are irregular , compact dwarf galaxies , with a median half - light radius of just 0.9  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the uv - derived sfr densities are high ( @xmath0 ) , suggesting that slsne form in overdense environments . </S>",
    "<S> their locations trace the uv light of their host galaxies , with a distribution intermediate between that of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) ( which are strongly clustered on the brightest regions of their hosts ) and a uniform distribution ( characteristic of normal core - collapse sne ) , though can not be statistically distinguished from either with the current sample size . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> this strengthens the picture that slsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinary core - collapse sne to form , and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies as do lgrbs . </S>",
    "<S> if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightest regions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample , this would indicate a different , potentially lower - mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs . </S>"
