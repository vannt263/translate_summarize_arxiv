    "the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 that appear in are positive constants determining the weight that is put on the regularity of the denoised image @xmath22 and the length of the edge set @xmath19 .    in order to show the existence of minimizers of the mumford  shah functional , a weak formulation depending only on one variable has been introduced by de giorgi et al .",

    "the set @xmath19 is replaced by the jump set @xmath23 of the function @xmath24 , the space of special function of bounded variation on @xmath9 .",
    "still , this reformulation of the functional provides no method for the actual numerical computation of minimizers .",
    "thus , various approximations of the functional @xmath25 have been proposed , most of them based on the concept of @xmath2-convergence .",
    "ambrosio and tortorelli @xcite proposed a variational model in which they replace the set @xmath23 by a continuous function @xmath26 with values close to @xmath27 near @xmath23 , and values close to @xmath28 away from @xmath23 .",

    "@xcite , region growing and merging methods have been proposed . for detailed analysis of the mumford  shah model ,",
    "we refer reader to the book by morel and solimini @xcite .",
    "we also refer to the books @xcite , where some of the above mentioned results are shortly discussed .    in the following",
    ", we will show how the problem of minimizing the mumford  shah functional @xmath25 can be approached by means of an asymptotic expansion that is based on the idea of topological asymptotic analysis . in its original formulation ( see , e.g. , sokoowski et al .",
    "@xcite , garreau et al .",

    "@xcite ) , this theory investigates a variation of some objective functional depending on subsets of @xmath29 with respect to the subtraction of a small ball from the considered domain .",
    "this variation is a scalar function , called the topological gradient or the topological derivative , and its largest negative values indicate positions , where it is good to remove a small ball . in @xcite ,",
    "amstutz proposed to modify the definition of topological gradient and provide variations of a given functional with respect to change of certain material properties , and not a domain topology .",
    "recently , topological asymptotic analysis has been also applied for image processing purposes by auroux et al .",
    "@xcite and by muszkieta @xcite .    in order to apply the theory of topological asymptotic expansions , it is necessary that the functional to be minimized depends solely on the set @xmath19 .",
    "this can be achieved in the case of the mumford  shah functional by noting that the minimizing pair @xmath30 is uniquely determined by either of the components @xmath31 and @xmath32 : the set @xmath32 coincides with the jump set @xmath33 of the function @xmath31 .",
    "conversely , @xmath31 can be computed from @xmath32 by solving the partial differential equation @xmath34 now consider the functional @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the solution of   with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath19 . then the pair @xmath37 minimizes the functional @xmath25 , if and only if @xmath38 for all @xmath17 .",
    "the idea is now to use a gradient descent like approach to the minimization of the functional @xmath39 . starting from an initial guess @xmath19 of the edge set ( for instance @xmath40 ) , one adds to @xmath19 those points , whose inclusion would lead to a near to maximal decrease of the cost functional @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , one adjoins to the set @xmath19 small balls of radius @xmath0 centered at the points @xmath41 and tries to compute an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath42 for some functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "those @xmath45 for which @xmath46 attains the largest negative values are then added to the set @xmath19 .",
    "this process is iterated , until the function @xmath46 becomes non - negative everywhere .    in the case of the mumford  shah functional",
    ", this procedure can not applied directly , because the functional is infinite whenever @xmath19 contains a set of positive lebesgue measure .",
    "we therefore propose to use a different , though related , functional for the computation of the asymptotic expansion , which is based on an approximation of the one - dimensional hausdorff measure : the number of balls of radius @xmath0 that are required to cover a set @xmath19 , multiplied with @xmath1 , provides a good estimate of @xmath18 for @xmath47 small enough and @xmath19 sufficiently regular . in the following , we introduce this approximating functional @xmath48 .",
    "however , because we later prove the @xmath2-convergence of this functional to @xmath25 , it is necessary to let @xmath48 depend on two functions , the function @xmath22 and a piecewise constant edge indicator function @xmath26 :    for each finite set @xmath49 and each @xmath50 we define the function @xmath51 by @xmath52 for every @xmath53 we define @xmath54 here we set @xmath55 , if @xmath56 for any @xmath49 .",

    "based on theorem  [ thm : gasymptotic ] , we propose the following algorithm for the approximate minimization of the functional @xmath48 for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath429 .    [ alg ] let @xmath266 , @xmath20 , @xmath430 , @xmath0 , and @xmath50 be given .",

    "this theorem states that adding in the @xmath328-th step a point @xmath172 to the edge indicator will approximately result in a decrease of the functional @xmath439 by approximately @xmath440 .",
    "thus , we will obtain the steepest descent , if we add a point @xmath172 , where @xmath436 is maximal . at the same time",
    "the adding of another ball leads to an increase of the term @xmath345 by @xmath441 . in total",
    ", the value of @xmath48 will increase if   holds , else @xmath48 will decrease and therefore it makes sense to include the point @xmath172 into the edge set .    in order to increase the performance of the algorithm , it makes sense to add not just one ball in each iteration , but rather several ones .",
    "also in this case a similar approximation as theorem  [ thm : gasymptotic ] holds , and thus the same criterion for adding new points can be applied .",
    "this strategy has been used in the numerical examples below .",
    "we now compare the results obtained with algorithm  [ alg ] with results obtained using the approximation introduced by ambrosio and tortorelli  @xcite .",
    "this latter method consists in minimizing the functional @xmath442 again , the function @xmath26 serves as an edge indicator in the sense that the points where @xmath26 is close to zero are an approximation of the edge set @xmath19 of the solution of the mumford  shah functional . in contrast to the approximation by means of the functional @xmath48 , however , where the edge set is given as the points where the function @xmath26 is equal to @xmath104 , in case of the functional   one has to threshold @xmath26 in order to obtain a precisely defined edge set .",
    "the minimization of @xmath443 has been carried out by alternately solving the corresponding euler ",
    "lagrange equations with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath26 . for the discretization",
    ", we have used a finite element approach with piecewise bilinear basis functions on the pixel grid .",
    "the same discretization has been used for the computation of @xmath444 in the second step of algorithm  [ alg ] .",
    "figures  [ fi : boats ] and  [ fi : peppers ] show a comparison of the results of the ambrosio  tortorelli approximation and algorithm  [ alg ] .",
    "the edge indicators are in both cases comparable , though our algorithm in general classifies more points as edges .",
    "the main difference between the results is that the ambrosio ",
    "tortorelli approximation leads to a diffuse edge indicator , while our method produces well defined edges . as a consequence , also the smoothed images tend to be less blurred ; compare , for instance , the various light reflections in figure  [ fi : peppers ] .",
