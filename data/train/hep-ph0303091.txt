    "since the observatory is located at very large height ( @xmath3  km ) in comparison with thickness of the atmosphere , the fraction of detected flux is known , and thus this is the calorimetric experiment ( absorption of light in the upward direction is small ) . a telescope with diameter 2.5 m controls the area @xmath4",

    "gravitational interaction mixes the visible and mirror neutrino states , and thus causes the oscillation between them",
    ".    a cosmological scenario must provide the suppression of the mirror matter and in particular the density of mirror neutrinos at the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "it can be obtained in the two - inflaton model @xcite .",
    "the rolling of two inlaton to minimum of the potential is not synchronised , and when mirror inflaton reaches minimum , the ordinary inflaton continues its rolling , inflating thus the mirror matter produced by the mirror inflaton .",
    "while mirror matter is suppressed , the mirror topological defects can strongly dominate @xcite .",
