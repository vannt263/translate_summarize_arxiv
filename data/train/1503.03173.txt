    "launched in march of 2009 , nasa s _ kepler _  mission is a space - based photometric telescope designed to address important questions on the frequency and characteristics of planetary systems around sun - like stars , and to search for transiting earth - analogs  @xcite .",
    "statistical answers to these questions are required in order to constrain planetary formation and evolution scenarios .",
    "_ kepler _  detects transiting planetary candidates signals through continuous photometric monitoring of about 160000 stars at high photometric precision ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this unprecedented sample of potential exoplanets has become an immense resource for statistical studies of the properties and distributions of planets around main - sequence stars ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "this ensemble of candidates is also necessary for determining the occurrence rate of exoplanets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and more specifically of earth - size planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mission has led to the detection of 2740 _ planetary candidates _ during the first two years of operation  @xcite . however , only a small subset of these candidates have been confirmed as true planets .",
    "this is because asserting the planetary nature of a transit signal requires significant observational follow - up and computational efforts that are unachievable in a practical sense for every detected candidate .",
    "we do not expect all the signals to be due to planets : many astrophysical phenomena can reproduce a similar lightcurve to that of a transiting planet  @xcite . indeed , false - positive contamination is one of the main challenges facing transit surveys such as _ kepler_. during the last decade , ground - based surveys dedicated to the search of transiting planets have spent considerable effort in confirming the planetary nature of photometrically detected candidates  @xcite .",
    "these surveys have established that false positives usually outnumber true planetary systems by a large factor .",
    "it has been shown that from 80 to 90% of the candidates are false - positives for the most successful ground - based exoplanet surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons , the true false positive rate of _ kepler _  remains an active research area because false positives can critically bias estimates of planet occurrence rates ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the subject of the current paper .",
    "the _ kepler _  survey poses new challenges for dynamically confirming ( using radial velocity or transit timing variation ) the planetary nature of candidates .",
    "this is because of intrinsic characteristics of the _ kepler _  target sample such as the large number of candidates , the candidates small size ( presumably of low mass ) , and the faintness of the host stars .",
    "consequently , we must develop new methods to determine the origin of _ kepler _  detectable signals .",
    "one method consists of in - depth statistical validation of candidates by ruling out false positive scenarios one - by - one ( e.g. , blender ,  @xcite ) ; it fully exploits the information from the shape of a transit lightcurve  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this method is to demonstrate _ statistically _ that a transit signal is more likely to be of planetary origin than to be a false positive . in the case of _ kepler",
    "_ , this is generally made possible using follow - up observations , such as spectroscopy , imaging , and multi - wavelength transit photometry ( including with _ spitzer _ ) .",
    "this was demonstrated in the case of the first validation of a super - earth  @xcite .",
    "however , each candidate validated by this method requires intense observational and computational follow - up work .",
    "in particular , the follow - up strategies adopted by the _ kepler _  team are summarized in  @xcite , and often require substantial efforts and resources .",
    "therefore , it is impractical at present to apply the blender method to each individual _ kepler _  transit signal . yet at the same time , we require the fractional values of _ bona fide _ planets , or of astrophysical false positives , to accurately determine the occurrence of planetary systems from _ kepler _",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are currently several approaches to estimate the _ false positive rate _ ( fpr ) of the _ kepler _  sample .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of contamination on the fpr due to the design of _ kepler _  itself , such as direct prf ( pixel response function ) , antipodal reflections , ccd cross - talks , or columns anomalies .",
    "the contamination sources are eclipsing binaries , variable stars , and other transiting planets and results in a significant number of the known kois to be false positives .",
    "@xcite performed period - ephemeris matching among all transiting planet , eclipsing binary , and variable star sources .",
    "they examined the full koi list and found that 12% of kois are false - positives due to contamination .",
    "other approaches use generic arguments about the _ kepler _  signals to infer the overall _ kepler _  fpr ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "there are also parallel attempts to estimate the fpr of targeted specific samples of kepler objects of interest ( kois ) .",
    "for example , studies have focused on close - in gas giant planet candidates ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , or on the multiple planet system candidates  @xcite .",
    "the latter sample contains less than a percent of false positives  @xcite .",
    "other methods use a proxy of the host stars mean density to estimate the _ kepler _  fpr ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we conduct two campaigns to measure transit depths of kois with _ spitzer _ , and combine these observations to followup studies , in order to assess the overall fpr of these samples .",
    "we adopt an approach that expands significantly the number of kois that are examined using multi - wavelength photometry .",
    "our project focuses primarily on smaller size candidates , such as mini - neptune and super - earth size objects , compared to previous targeted sample studies .",
    "we select a sample of 51 candidates , measure their transit depth at 4.5 microns with irac , and combine these observations with complementary follow - up studies and information from _ kepler _  in order to derive the false positive probability ( fpp ) for each object .",
    "our method is based on the fact that the relative depth of a planetary transit is achromatic ( neglecting the modest effect of limb - darkening ) , but not for a blend . in contrast , a blend containing a false positive , for instance an eclipsing binary , can yield a depth that can vary significantly with the instrument bandpass and stellar temperatures .",
    "the amplitude of this effect increases correspondingly as the difference in wavelength between the two bandpasses increases . since _",
    "kepler _  observes through a broad bandpass at visible wavelengths , large color - dependent effects for false positives caused by the presence of blended cool stars can be revealed at infrared wavelengths .",
    "we first applied this method by combining _",
    "spitzer _",
    "data from this program and _ kepler _  data in  @xcite .    the two science exploration _",
    "spitzer _",
    "programs , which form the core of the data presented in the current paper , have been an active part of the attempts to validate kois . about 20% of the total amount of",
    "_ spitzer _  telescope time allocated for this project has already been used in publications dedicated to the confirmation or the validation of 22 kepler planets . these are kepler-10c @xcite , kepler-11b @xcite , kepler-14b @xcite , kepler-18b , c @xcite , kepler-19b @xcite , kepler-20b , c @xcite , kepler-22b @xcite , kepler-25b , c @xcite , kepler-26c @xcite , kepler-32b @xcite , kepler-37b @xcite , kepler-49b , c @xcite , kepler-61b @xcite , kepler-62e @xcite , kepler-68b @xcite , kepler-410a b @xcite , kepler-93b @xcite ( see table  [ tab : fpp ] for the correspondance between _ kepler _",
    "names and koi numbers ) .",
    "furthermore , some of the kois of the current study are already confirmed or validated as planets without using the _ spitzer _  data . in particular ,",
    "@xcite validate 851 planets in multiple - planet system candidates ( including 11 kois used in our study ) by applying statistical arguments @xcite on the q1-q8 _ kepler _  data .",
    "while the radial velocity technique allowed the confirmation of the planetary nature of kepler-89d @xcite , kepler-94b @xcite , kepler-102d , e @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the present work disregard previous validation or confirmation of individual object in order to treat the whole koi list followed with _ spitzer _  as a statistical ensemble ; this is necessary to estimate the fpr of this sample .",
    "finally , 150 hours ( 11% ) of time from these two exploration science programs were used to study the atmospheres of kepler - detected hot jupiters detected by monitoring their secondary eclipses  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first describe the different types of astrophysical false positives that we are concerned with ( section  [ sec : fptype ] ) .",
    "we then present the sample of candidates that were selected to conduct this study ( section  [ sec : select ] ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "observations and results are presented in sections  [ sec : spfollowup ] and  [ sec : spconstraint ] .",
    "the combination of various observational constraints ( section  [ sec : observations ] ) allows us to estimate the fpr of our _ kepler _  sample ( section  [ sec : fpp ] ) .",
    "we finally discuss the implications of our findings in section  [ sec : discussion ] , in particular , in the context of other studies .",
    "there are a variety of astrophysical phenomena that can mimic the signal of a transiting planet passing in front of a main sequence star targeted by _",
    "these events are produced by additional stars falling within the same aperture as the target star ( presumed to be the brighter star ) , and significantly diluting the total light observed by kepler .",
    "more specifically , the kinds of false positives that we are concerned with in our study include background or foreground eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) , blended within the kepler aperture of the target star , as well as those that are physically associated to the target star .",
    "we refer to these latter configurations as hierarchical triples ( hts ) .",
    "hts often can not be resolved in high - angular resolution imaging . in this paper",
    ", we check for the presence of a stellar companion by looking at how transit depths vary between the _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  bandpasses",
    ". the dilution by a stellar companion , blended in the _ kepler _  aperture of a planet host star of interest , can be responsible for variations in the wavelength - dependent transit depths measured for a planet .",
    "we do not consider the case where the contaminating star is itself transited by a planet as a potential false positive scenario .    before searching for false - positives in _ kepler _ , it is important to recall the major vetting steps that each _ kepler _  target goes through .",
    "first , a comprehensive study was applied when assembling the kepler input catalog ( kic ;  @xcite ) , leading to the identification of some ebs and stellar giants , hence avoiding their continuous monitoring with _ kepler_. about 160000 stars were carefully selected from the kic catalog and were continuously monitored photometrically with _",
    "kepler _  ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite explains the detection of transit events and the vetting processes that are then applied to reject the most common false positive scenarios .",
    "transit - like signals are identifiable from tces ( threshold - crossing events ) using the _ kepler _  photometry alone . the _ kepler",
    "_  team adopted a detection threshold of @xmath1 for the transit so that no more than one spurious signal can occur from purely random fluctuations amongst the 160000 stars . in practice ,",
    "the process of vetting from tces to kois involves several qualitative steps that could affect the _ kepler _  fpr .",
    "@xcite have validated the integrity of this threshold while @xcite report that tcert ( threshold crossing event review team ) is 92.9% effective in detecting false - positives for kois from q1-q8 .",
    "the _ kepler _  pipeline identifies grazing ebs by searching for even / odd transit depth differences or by looking for the presence of a clear signature of secondary eclipses .",
    "giant star - eclipsed - by - a - dwarf star scenarios are detected by recognizing that the primary star is a giant , thereby implying that the size of the transiting body must itself be stellar ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of the shift in the photocenter at a significance level greater than 3@xmath0 and the comparison of the difference of in- and out - of transit images show the true source location .",
    "interestingly , this technique permits the identification of potential contamination by unresolved close - by ebs in an efficient manner  @xcite .",
    "however , even for high transit snr candidates , some blended binary scenarios remain undetectable through the vetting processes . therefore , estimating the fpr from _ kepler _  requires knowledge of the probability of encountering such blend scenarios .    throughout this paper",
    ", we follow the notation introduced by  @xcite : the objects that comprise a blended binary system are referred to as the ` secondary ' and ` tertiary ' , and the candidate star host is referred to as the ` primary ' .",
    "the distance along the line - of - sight between the binary system and the main star is parametrized in terms of the difference in distance modulus , @xmath2 .",
    "the notation applies to every astrophysical false positive scenario .",
    "the first _ spitzer _",
    "follow - up program comprised 36 of the first 400 kois identified by the kepler survey  @xcite .",
    "a second set of 23 candidates was selected from the 2335 kois compiled by  @xcite for the second _ spitzer _  program .",
    "we present the observations and the results for the 36 kois from the first program and 15 kois from the second program ; the current project uses in total 51 kois .",
    "the remaining 8 targets from the second program were not observed yet at the time of the present analysis ( kois-248.03 , 1686.01 , 2290.01 , 2124.01 , 2311.01 , 2418.01 , 2474.01 , 2650.01 ) .",
    "kois-248.03 and 2650.01 have recently been validated as kepler-49d , and kepler-395c , respectively  @xcite .",
    "importantly , we select these two ensembles with very different criteria . for the first set , our goal was to derive the fpr of a sub - sample by following - up candidates that represent the diversity of kois initially found . to reach this goal ,",
    "the first sample is chosen to cover representative ranges of orbital periods , transit depths , stellar types and magnitudes that the first 400 kois could allow .",
    "the size of this sample includes about 10% of the known kois at the time .",
    "the ranges of the second set are more tightly constrained : we select candidates for which the expected planetary radius @xmath3 would be less than 1.6 @xmath4  and the @xmath5 ( using a stellar temperature @xmath6  estimated from the kic ) .",
    "overall , our sample of stellar hosts span a range of kic estimated temperature from @xmath7 up to @xmath8 . for both ensembles ,",
    "the requirement was imposed to accept targets with predicted transit depths detection of at least @xmath9 ( scaled from the _ kepler _  value ) , achievable with three or less transits observed with _ spitzer_. the selected candidate radii as function of their periods are presented in figure  [ fig : rpper ] .",
    "we use _ warm - spitzer_/irac  @xcite at 4.5  to observe transits of the 51 selected kois between may 2010 and july 2012 .",
    "we obtained these observations as part of two large science exploration programs ( program i d 60028 and 80117 ) . in total , 1400  hours of _ spitzer _  time is used for the follow - up of _ kepler _  targets .",
    "of this time , 800  hours of observations are used to complete the first program ( 60028 ) and 600  hours are dedicated to the second program ( 80117 ) .",
    "150  hours of this time were used to study the atmospheres of hot - jupiters detected by _ kepler _  during secondary eclipses  @xcite .",
    "the remaining 1250  hours are dedicated to validating kois and estimating the fpr in the _ kepler _  data , and are the focus of this paper .",
    "a total of 157 _ spitzer _  aors ( astronomical observation requests ) have been submitted for these two programs .",
    "this paper focuses on the study of the 51 kois presented in section  [ sec : select ] that have been observed with _",
    "spitzer _  during 95 visits ( aors ) .",
    "for most of the targeted stars , the data were obtained in a continuous staring full array mode ( @xmath10 pixels ) with exposure times of 12 or 30  s , depending on the brightness of the star of interest .",
    "we used the subarray mode of irac for the brightest host stars . in this mode , only a @xmath11-pixel part of the detector is used ; this covers a @xmath12 field of view ( pixel size of 1.2 ) and allows for higher cadences ( 0.2  s exposures ) .",
    "we choose to put our target at the default pointing position in the center of the field - of - view in order to avoid known hot pixels and bad columns .",
    "this area of the detector is well characterized since it has been extensively used for extrasolar planet studies .",
    "an offset is applied to a few kois in order to avoid the presence of a close - by bright target on the same line or column .",
    "the ephemerides of the kois were taken from the kfop database , which are now available on the cfop website and we ensured that each visit lasted approximately 2.5 times the transit duration . we observe 29 kois , amongst the 51 presented here , during multiple transit events in order to improve the snr on the combined lightcurves .",
    "tables  [ tab : spitzer1 ] and  [ tab : spitzer2 ] list these observations for each program respectively .",
    "we use the bcd files ( basic calibrated data ) produced by the _",
    "spitzer_/irac pipeline .",
    "these files include corrections for dark current , flat fielding , pixel non - linearity , and conversion to flux units .",
    "@xcite describes the method used to produce photometric time series in each channel from the bcd files .",
    "the method consists of finding the centroid position of the stellar point - spread - function ( psf ) and performing aperture photometry .",
    "we first convert the pixel intensities to electrons based on the detector gain and exposure time provided in the fits headers .",
    "this facilitates the evaluation of the photometric errors .",
    "we extract the bjd date for each image from the fits headers and compute it to mid - exposure .",
    "we then correct for transient pixels in each individual image using a 20-point sliding median filter of the pixel intensity versus time .",
    "to do so , we compare each pixel s intensity to the median of the 10 preceding and 10 following exposures at the same pixel position and we replace outliers greater than @xmath13 with their median value .",
    "the fraction of pixels that we replace varies between 0.15 to 0.5% .",
    "the centroid position of the stellar psf is then determined using daophot - type photometry procedures , ` gcntrd ` , from the idl astronomy library .",
    "we use the ` aper ` routine to perform aperture photometry with a circular aperture of variable radius .",
    "for each visit , we search for the best aperture size ranging between 1 and 8 pixels radii in steps of 0.5 pixel .",
    "we propagate the uncertainties as a function of the aperture radius and we adopt the size that provides the smallest errors . we notice that the snr does not vary significantly with the aperture radii for all the dataset .",
    "the final aperture sizes are set between @xmath14 and @xmath15  pixels depending on the kois .",
    "we determine the background level for each frame from two methods .",
    "the first method uses a fit of a gaussian to the central region of a histogram of counts from the full array , where the background values are defined by the peak position of this gaussian .",
    "the second method uses the measure of the median value of the pixels inside an annulus centered around the star , with inner and outer radii of @xmath16 and @xmath17 pixels respectively , to estimate the background overall level .",
    "both estimates produce similar results .",
    "the contribution of the background to the total flux from the stars is low for all observations , from 0.1% to 1.0% depending on the images , and fairly constant for each aor .",
    "we find that the residuals from the final light curve modeling are minimized by adopting the center of the gaussian fits .",
    "after producing the photometric time - series , we use a sliding median filter to select and trim outliers greater than @xmath18 , which correspond to less than two % of the data .",
    "we also discard the first half - hour of all observations , which is affected by a significant telescope jitter before stabilization .",
    "six aors , corresponding to a total of 30  hours , were gathered at levels above 30,000 dn ( in the raw data ) ; this is a level where the detector response tends to be non - linear by several percent . in order to avoid misinterpreting these data",
    ", we do not consider aors that are above the range of linearization correction .",
    "therefore , these six aors are not used in this work and they are not presented in table  [ tab : spitzer1 ] and  [ tab : spitzer2 ] .",
    "as described in @xcite , we use a transit light curve model multiplied by instrumental decorrelation functions to measure the transit parameters and their uncertainties from the _ spitzer _  data .",
    "we compute the transit light curves with the idl transit routine ` occultsmall ` from @xcite .",
    "this model depends on the following parameters : the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath19 , the orbital semi - major axis to stellar - radius ratio ( system scale ) @xmath20 , the impact parameter @xmath21 , the time of mid transit @xmath22 , and limb darkening coefficients .",
    "the measured parameter of interest here is the transit depth .",
    "we fix @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 to their values measured from the _ kepler _  photometry .",
    "the snr of our observations is low compared to typical _",
    "spitzer _  observations of brighter transiting planets .",
    "the limb darkening effect is negligible at this level of precision ; the coefficients are set to zero .",
    "we assume an eccentricity of zero for the kois orbit since this parameter does not affect the transit depth measurements at the level of precision we are working with .",
    "only @xmath19 is set as a free parameter to represent the astrophysical signal .",
    "spitzer_/irac photometry is known to be systematically affected by the so - called pixel - phase effect ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is seen as oscillations in the measured fluxes with a period of approximately 70  minutes ( period of the telescope pointing jitter ) for data secured prior october 2010 , and 40 minutes for data secured after . by october 2010 the _ spitzer",
    "_  engineering team was able to correlate the pointing wobble with the cycling of a heater used to keep a battery within its operating temperature range . following this discovery , the _ spitzer _",
    "team significantly reduced the amplitude and the period of the pointing wobble .",
    "the amplitude of this effect varies between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , peak to peak , depending on the position of the star in the array .",
    "we decorrelated our signal in each channel using a linear function of time for the baseline ( two parameters ) and three types of functions to correct the data for the intrapixel variations : a linear function of the psf position ( two parameters ) , a quadratic function ( four parameters ) and a quadratic with a cross term ( five parameters ) .",
    "@xcite describes in detail the last function .",
    "we perform a simultaneous levenberg ",
    "marquardt least - squares fit  @xcite to the data to determine the transit depths and the instrumental parameters . for each visit",
    ", we adopt the decorrelation function that significantly improves the @xmath25 minimization .",
    "we rescale the errors on each photometric point to be set to the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the residuals from the initial best - fit of the data .",
    "hence , the reduced @xmath25 becomes one .",
    "all the data - point measurement errors are therefore assumed to be identical for each lightcurve . as an example , figure  [ fig : spitzerlightcurves ] shows the raw data and the corrected _ spitzer _  transit lightcurve of koi-701.03 ( kepler-62e ) . figures  [ fig : spitzerlightcurvesa ] ,  [ fig : spitzerlightcurvesb ] , and  [ fig : spitzerlightcurvesc ] present the normalized , corrected , binned and combined lightcurves with their associated best fit models for all the observed kois that are presented in the current study .",
    "we estimate parameter uncertainties using two different methods : markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) and residual permutation methods .",
    "our mcmc implementation uses the metropolis - hasting algorithm with gibbs sampling @xcite .",
    "we assume uniform prior distributions for all jump parameters .",
    "we adjust the width of the distribution from which we randomly draw the jump sizes in each parameter until 2025% of jumps are executed in each of the parameters .",
    "we create five chains , each with 10@xmath26 points , where each chain starts with a different set of starting parameters ( each parameter is assigned a starting position that is + @xmath27 or @xmath28 from the best - fit values ) .",
    "we discard the first 10% of jumps of each chain to remove the chain s transient dependence on the starting parameters .    in order to obtain an estimate of the correlated and systematic errors in our measurements",
    ", we use the residual permutation bootstrap , also called `` prayer bead '' method , described in  @xcite . in this method , the residuals of the initial fit are shifted systematically and sequentially by one frame , and then added to the transit light curve model before fitting again .    for both methods ,",
    "the posterior distributions are used to estimate the errors : we allow asymmetric error bars spanning @xmath29 of the nearest points above and below the values of the parameters associated with the minimum @xmath25 to derive the @xmath30 uncertainties for each parameter .",
    "we find that the two approaches provide consistent results .",
    "tables  [ tab : spitzer1 ] and  [ tab : spitzer2 ] present the transit depths and associated errors derived from the mcmc technique .    finally , we check that kois for which we have multi - epoch measurements have transit depths that agree within the @xmath9 level .",
    "we combine the measured transit depths for these kois by computing the weighted means and errors .",
    "we use standard aperture photometry of each individual bcd image in order to compute the flux for all the kois in our sample .",
    "we measure the averaged flux over the background annulus .",
    "the main difference between the procedure used in the section and the one described in section  [ sec : spdepth ] is that we use a fixed aperture size with a radius of 3 pixels surrounded by an annulus of 12-to-20 pixels to estimate the flux and the background , respectively .",
    "furthermore , only the out - of - transit data are considered for determining the source flux densities .",
    "we first convert the bcd images into mjy per pixel units from their original mjy per steradian units .",
    "then we estimate the centroid position of the main target star s psf for each image , and compute aperture photometry centered on the source .",
    "we apply an aperture correction of 1.113 at 4.5  ( this value is taken from irac data handbook ) .",
    "we correct the full lightcurve for the intrapixel sensitivity using the method described in section  [ sec : spdepth ] .",
    "color and array - location - dependent photometric corrections are also applied to the photometry ; the latter accounts for the variation in pixel solid angle ( due to distortion ) and the variation of the spectral response ( due to the tilted filters and wide field - of - view ) over the array  @xcite .",
    "most of our data taken in full - array mode is such that the psf is centered on the central pixel of the array ( 128;128 ) , so no array correction is applied for this dataset .",
    "the brightest stars of our sample are secured in subarray mode for which we apply an array correction of 0.68% .",
    "we convert the surface brightness ( in mjy ) into _ spitzer _  magnitudes at 4.5  using a zero - magnitude flux density ( zmag ) of 179.7 jy as computed by  @xcite .",
    "we finally compute the uncertainties on the flux densities using the photon noise and the standard deviation of the measurements from all the individual frames .",
    "we test the accuracy of our procedure using _ spitzer _",
    "irac photometric calibrator datasets taken from the public _ spitzer _",
    "archive : bd+60 1753 and hd180609 .",
    "we check that our magnitudes match those of  @xcite at better than the @xmath30 level .",
    "tables  [ tab : spitzer1 ] and  [ tab : spitzer2 ] present the flux densities and the corresponding magnitude at 4.5  for each koi . while the uncertainties in these tables are the formal values , we have conservatively adjusted some of the errors to be no lower than 2% .",
    "this lower limit is based on the findings of  @xcite .",
    "this section describes in detail how we use _ spitzer _  observations to rule - out false positive scenarios .",
    "the applied methodology makes use of the transit depths measured with _",
    "spitzer _  and with _ kepler _ , as well as the measured colors _ kepler__spitzer_.    the true transit depth @xmath31 obtained from an eclipsing system comprising a main object ( 2 ) and its companion ( 3 ) corresponds to :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the emitted fluxes in the same bandpass .",

    "stars that are unable to reproduce the observables are removed using complementary observational constraints ( e.g. , centroid analysis , ao imaging , etc ... ) .",

    "further details about the steps undertaken are given below .    to estimate the likelihood of a planet , we rely on the list of candidates from kepler .",
    "we assume here that all the kois are true planets and that the period distribution of our _ spitzer _  sample follows , in first order , the period distribution of the kois .",
    "the latest assumption is verified in figure  [ fig : period_distribution ] for the koi distribution derived from  @xcite .",
    "the kois are separated per period range using equal logarithmically spaced intervals .",

    "we estimate the stellar density using a stellar population synthesis model of the galaxy , the besanon model  @xcite .",
    "we use this model to derive the frequency of stars present in the photometric apertures around each koi in our sample .",
    "we adopt the stellar densities predicted by this model in the r band , which is a band sufficiently close to the _ kepler _  bandpass for our purposes . instead of estimating the stellar population in a cone around the line of sight of each koi",
    ", we create a grid of 24 cells evenly spaced over _ kepler _",
    "s field of view ( about one cell per _ kepler _  ccd module ) .",
    "an aperture of 1  square degree centered on each cell of the grid is chosen for the initial estimate of stellar population .",
    "we then perform stellar density calculations in half - magnitude bins of apparent brightness , from a r - magnitude of 5 down to magnitude 24",
    ". we also account for interstellar extinction with a coefficient of 0.5  mag  kpc@xmath69 in @xmath70 band .",
    "the number of stars that fall in the aperture of each grid varies between 30,000 and 1,400,000 , depending on the galactic latitude and longitude of the kois .",
    "we derive the stellar population using the closest cell relative to the target . in this way",
    ", we evaluate the expected number density of neighboring stars , and their mass distribution per square degree and per magnitude bin .",
    "we then estimate the number of ebs amongst these neighbor stars that could potentially reproduce the signal detected in _ kepler_. it corresponds to the occurrence rate of binaries multiply by the probability that they undergo eclipses . this rate has been measured in the _ kepler _  field  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "1261 detached binary systems have been found from the first four months of observations with periods less than 125  days  @xcite .",
    "these are the typical false positives of interest for our study .",
    "therefore , the frequency of ebs that we consider is @xmath71 .",
    "this frequency is computed from short period detached binaries and it depends on their period ; it decreases below 0.80% for longer periods .",
    "consequently , the uniform frequency of ebs that we use in this work is a conservative value .",
    "this allows us to compute upper limits for the fpps .",
    "we note that this frequency includes eclipsing pairs in triple or higher multiplicity stellar systems .",
    "finally , the total blend frequency @xmath67 that is inserted in equation  [ eq : fpp ] is found by combining the probabilities associated with all background or foreground binaries .",
    "for each koi in our sample , we use the density of stars in each magnitude bin determined using the population synthesis model .",
    "we now calculate the fraction of these stars that would remain false positive candidates after taking into account the available observational constraints .",
    "we describe below the method used in this task .",
    "the first step uses the faint limit condition described in section  [ sec : faintlimit ] .",
    "this removes all the stars that are too faint to reproduce the transit depths observed in the _ kepler _  photometry .",
    "the remaining stars pass through the second step that combines high - resolution images of the target s neighborhood ( ao observations ) and centroid motion analyzes when available .",
    "this provides the spatial extent considered for blend frequency calculations .",
    "these constraints significantly decrease the size of the apertures that could hide a background or foreground binary : this is sometimes 5  and often 2  . even though stars located at distances beyond 5  can reproduce _ kepler _  signals  @xcite , we assume for simplicity that all the stars that are beyond the limits found by the centroid method can not mimic transit signals .    these stars are therefore excluded from the blend frequency calculations .",
    "this step always removes the largest number of possible blend scenarios .",
    "it is a very powerful tool for identifying background ebs blended with the target  @xcite . in a final third step ,",
    "we use the constraints from the _ spitzer _",
    "observations , the measured transit depths and magnitudes , as described in section  [ sec : spconstraint ] . for each secondary star that survives the first two steps",
    ", we consider tertiary stars ( ebs ) , ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 solar masses , and test the ratios of transit depths .",
    "we compute the diluted ratio of the true transit depths for each scenario following equation  [ eq : ratiodepth ] .",
    "we compare this ratio to its observed value for each mass of the chosen tertiary star .",
    "if the calculated ratio is not consistent with the observed one , the tertiary star scenario is then rejected .",
    "we also apply the constraint from the color `` _ kepler__spitzer _ '' @xmath47 as given by equation  [ eq : color ] .",
    "we reject the tertiary star scenarios for which the calculated colors are not in agreement with the measured ones .",
    "overall , this third step allows us to remove most of the red dwarfs that could potentially remain as false positives .",
    "we finally find the total blend frequency by combining the probabilities associated with all background or foreground star .",
    "figure  [ fig : depth ] ( top panel ) shows the measured transit depths in the _ spitzer _  bandpass compared with those measured with _",
    "kepler_. we find that 50% of the sample have measured depths that agree within @xmath72 , and that 85% agree within @xmath27 ( figure  [ fig : depth ] , bottom ) .",
    "the distribution is therefore somewhat broader ( by @xmath7320% ) than expected for a gaussian with a standard deviation of unity , indicating that the _ spitzer _  and _ kepler _  transit depths for our kois are not all statistically consistent within their uncertainties .",
    "this may be caused by : ( i ) the presence of false positives in our sample ; ( ii ) dilution from unresolved companion stars resulting in wavelength - dependent transit depths ; or ( iii ) underestimated uncertainties in our measurement of the spitzer transit depths .",
    "below we present evidence that some of the kois do indeed suffer from dilution effects .",
    "likewise , biases in determining reliable uncertainties for our _ spitzer _  measurements can not be entirely ruled out , as they depend on our ability to correct the data for the main source of systematic errors , which is the intra - pixel sensitivity .",
    "there are three candidates for which the transit depths measured from the _ kepler _  photometry are significantly deeper ( @xmath74 ) than the depths measured from _ spitzer _ : koi-12.01 , koi-13.01 , koi-94.01 .",
    "these objects are three jupiter - size planet candidates out of the four from this family that we have in our sample . since we observed koi-13.01 and koi-94.01 with",
    "_ spitzer _",
    ", these candidates have been confirmed as _ bona fide _",
    "planets by @xcite , and @xcite respectively .",
    "these three kois have known close - by companions which are located at closer than 1  , well within the _ kepler _  apertures and within the _ spitzer _  psfs .",
    "the host star koi-13 is known to be part of a stellar binary system , both components being rapidly rotating a stars @xcite .",
    "the companion is about 300  k cooler than the primary host star and is 0.3 magnitude fainter in the kepler bandpass .",
    "similarly , the cfop shows that koi-12 is also a massive fast rotator star .",
    "direct images of the close environment of koi-12 reveal the presence of two fainter stars within 1  of the primary host .",
    "a low mass - star companion at 06 from koi-94 has been detected and this explains the significant difference of measured transit depths  @xcite .",
    "the candidates with the largest discrepancies are koi-82.01 and koi-98.01 at the @xmath75 and @xmath76 level , respectively . for koi-98.01 ,",
    "the host star is known to have a stellar companion at 03 @xcite .",
    "koi-82 has no close by companion detected by ao  @xcite ; we therefore attribute the discrepancy between _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  to statistical fluctuations . in general , the dilution produced by the presence of stars within the aperture of the koi result in chromatic differences between the transit depths . in the present cases ,",
    "the flux contamination from the companion stars to the primary host targets , koi-12 , 94 and 13 , vary with wavelength .",
    "the dilution is greater in the infrared compared to the visible as expected for cooler ( redder ) contaminants .",
    "because the contaminant stars contribute proportionally to more flux in the infrared compared to the visible , the dilution produced by their presence is larger at longer wavelengths .",
    "this results in shallower measured transit depths in the _ spitzer _  bandpass compared to the _ kepler _  bandpass .",
    "koi-258.01 is the only observed candidate for which the lightcurve is not properly fitted by a transit planet model .",
    "the _ spitzer _  and",
    "the _ kepler _  transit lightcurves exhibit a clear v - shape .",
    "such objects do not usually appear in the koi list as they are flagged as false positives .",
    "koi-258.01 was ranked as a koi early on in the mission before being removed .",
    "the _ kepler _  project has since changed this target to an inactive mode as the primary star has two companions within 1.5 \" that are 2 to 3 magnitudes fainter in the k band . however , by the time of this decision the order to execute the _ spitzer _",
    "observation had already been given .",
    "for consistency we therefore choose to remove this object from the list of kois with computed fpps .      as described in section  [ sec : fpp ] , we estimate the fpp for each individual candidate on this list and table  [ tab : fpp ] presents our results .",
    "we find that half of the targets in our sample have a fpp which is lower than 1% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fpp ] ) . using the distribution of fpp for the complete sample ,",
    "we measure a median value of 1.3% .",
    "we calculate a robust estimate of the dispersion of the fpp distribution using the median absolute deviation as the initial guess , and then weighting points using tukey s biweight  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of our distribution measured by this method is 2.5% .",
    "this leads to an upper limit for the fpr of 3.8% at the @xmath77 level , and of 8.8% at the @xmath78 level .    at present",
    ", the sample of this study represents only 2% of the total candidates published so far  @xcite .",
    "therefore , extrapolating a _ kepler _",
    "fpr from such a small sample should be done with caution .",
    "furthermore , our sample is not a uniform sample of kois as it can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first category comprises the sub - sample of two thirds of the targets for which we have complementary observational constraints from direct imaging ( ao ) or _ kepler _ s centroid measurements .",
    "for this first sample , we measure a median fpr of 0.7% with a robust estimate of the dispersion of 0.8% .",
    "the second category comprises the rest of the targets for which we have no other constraints other than the _ kepler _  depths and the _ spitzer _  photometry .",
    "this is because we do not have the centroid analysis completed yet at the time of the work . for this second sample ,",
    "we measure a fpr lower than 24% at @xmath77 level , and we find that these fpps vary between 5-to-43 % .",
    "the kois of our sample with the highest fpp values ( e.g. koi-137.01 , 137.02 and 952.02 ) are indeed confirmed planets , which implies that their fpp is much lower than the values we can compute from the current study .",
    "all of this leads towards a rather low value for the overall fpr of the _ kepler _  sample .",
    "finally , we note that 11 of the observed kois have fpps @xmath79 0.3% .",
    "this implies that these detected signals are at least 99.7% consistent with planetary objects ; these kois can be considered as `` validated '' at the @xmath78 level of confidence .",
    "we use two _ spitzer _  science exploration programs for this study .",
    "we measure a median fpr of 0.8% with a dispersion of 0.9% from the kois of our first _ spitzer _",
    "program ( 60028 ) .",
    "this value becomes 14% , with a dispersion of 9% , for the 15 targets from our second program ( 80117 ) .",
    "this is a higher fpr compared to the value derived from the first _",
    "spitzer _  program .",
    "this is mainly because we do not have constraints from ao imaging nor from the _ kepler _  centroid analysis for these kois , unlike for most of the targets from the first program .",
    "this higher fpr value is also because the targeted sample is mainly composed of m - dwarf hosts .",
    "low mass stars are usually faint in the _ kepler _  bandpass ( 13.5 @xmath79mag@xmath80 16 ) , hence the faint magnitude limit ( equation  [ eq : blender ] ) allows for fainter , and hence more numerous , ebs to mimic the transit signal than for the brighter targets in our first program .",
    "this higher fpr value is also because the second sample contains mainly small size planet candidates ( super - earth candidates ) which typically have smaller transit depths .",
    "it is expected that the fpp increases with magnitude and with decreasing galactic latitude , and we observe such trends in figure  [ fig : fppb ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the faintness of m - stars also leads to a centroid analyzes with lower precisions , often prevents direct - imaging , and consequently contributes to a higher stellar blend frequency .",
    "the stellar parameters that we use for this study are from @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite recently updated the stellar properties using data from quarter 1 - 16 and different observational techniques , but homogeneously extract the parameters from the dartmouth stellar isochrones  @xcite .",
    "we find that the changes in stellar masses correspond to 9% in average compared to  @xcite for the kois used for this study .",
    "there are five kois of our list with updated masses that decrease between 15% and 30% ( koi-104 , 244 , 252 , 663 , 899 , and 947 ) . as noted by @xcite , these are mainly low mass stars .",
    "six stars have their updated masses that increase by more than 15% ( koi-13 , 87 , 98 , 111 , 446 , and 1362 ) .",
    "since the mass of the primary is kept fixed in our study , we look at two extreme cases of mass changes ( koi-252 and 87 ) in order to test the effect of these variations on our determination of the fpps .",
    "@xcite reported a mass for koi-252 of 0.5  m@xmath81 , a decrease of 30% , and a mass for koi-87 that is 20% larger ( 0.98  m@xmath81 ) .",
    "for these two objects , we compute and compare the apparent transit depth ratios with the old and with the new masses for the primary stars , and we estimate the variations of these ratios for different masses of secondaries and tertiaries ( such as presented in fig  [ fig : ratiodepthd ] ) .",
    "we find that with a decrease in the stellar mass of 30% for a 0.65  m@xmath81 ( koi-252 ) , the apparent transit ratios decrease of no more than 30% for any secondaries with masses lower than 1.2  m@xmath81 , and distance modulii of 5 . therefore , a primary star with a lower updated mass results in a lower number of low mass stars that can be rejected in order to satisfy the constraint from the _ spitzer _ transit depth .",
    "we compute the new fpp for koi-252.01 considering the updated mass .",
    "we find that the fpp increases to 0.3% , compared to 0.21% with the previous mass .",
    "inversely , increasing the mass of the primary by 20% ( 0.98  m@xmath81 , koi-87 ) generates an increase in the apparent transit ratios of less than 30% for any mass of the secondary that is lower than 1.2  m@xmath81 .",
    "the new fpp for this target goes down to 0.68% .",
    "we conclude that the new stellar masses computed by  @xcite do not change significantly the fpps of the kois that we have observed with _",
    "spitzer_. the fpps presented in the current study are slightly underestimated for the kois for which the updated masses have decreased compared to  @xcite , whereas they are slightly overestimated for the kois for which the reevaluated masses are increased .",
    "finally , the period distribution of the _ spitzer _  sample is skewed towards long period candidates compared to the distribution obtained from the list of kois ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : period_distribution ] ) .",
    "this is because the second _ spitzer _  sample was selected to focus on the super - earth candidates that orbit in or close to the habitable zone of their host stars .",
    "longer period kois are more difficult to characterize ( less _ kepler _  transit events ) , therefore the skewed period distribution would tend to overestimate the fpr extrapolated from the _ spitzer _  measurements .      the majority of the kois presented here have already been the focus of more specific studies , and have been validated or confirmed as true planets ( see table  [ tab : fpp ] ) .",
    "a subset of planets have constraints on their masses either from radial velocity measurements or from ttvs measured from the _ kepler _  transit lightcurves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nearly half ( 22 ) of the kois that we selected are in multiple transiting systems .",
    "eleven of these systems have been validated by @xcite using statistical arguments from @xcite and q1-q8 _ kepler _  data .",
    "most of these systems were initially selected from the multiples in order to understand this relatively unexplored class of objects .",
    "others have companions that were discovered after their selection .",
    "since then , we now know that candidates in multiple systems have a very high probability to be planets as demonstrated by  @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of this study , we assume that we have no information other than the depths and magnitudes measured in the _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  bandpasses , and the direct imaging observations when available .    in many cases",
    "the _ kepler _",
    "team relies on the blender procedure to assess the planetary nature of candidates in a statistical manner ( e.g. , kepler-9d : @xcite , kepler-11 g : @xcite , and kepler-10c : @xcite ) .",
    "blender takes into account the detailed morphology of the transit to reject as many false positive scenarios as possible .",
    "this approach is also used by other groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a candidate is considered validated when the likelihood of the signal being due to a true planet is much larger ( by orders of magnitude ) than the likelihood of a false positive .",
    "many of the steps followed in the present analysis are inspired by the blender approach , but are simplified and adapted to our purposes .",
    "in particular , we use here only the transit depth rather than its detailed shape to rule out blends .",
    "in contrast to blender , we adopt a single representative isochrone for all stars rather than different isochrones for the background binary and the target based on the measured spectroscopic properties .",
    "this latter approximation has little impact on our results .",
    "we test this for a sub - sample of our candidates for which we obtained spectroscopic reconnaissance of the main targets .",
    "the sub - sample comprises some candidates that were used for blender validation and have already been published ( see table  [ tab : fpp ] ) . for this subset ,",
    "we determine the mass , radius , and age of the host star from a fit of the isochrones as described by @xcite . we compute a new fpp for each koi in this subset .",
    "we compare this value to the fpp computed using the standard isochrone for the primary , and have checked that they are very similar .",
    "this is because most of the false positive scenarios are mainly ruled - out from the combination of the _ kepler _  photometry , the imaging and centroid information .",
    "we also test the robustness of our method using isochrones of different ages for the secondary star instead of a standard isochrone .",
    "the main motivation for this test is that a blended unassociated triple might have a component that is at a very different age from the primary .",
    "we let the secondary isochrones range over all ages between 0.7 to 10 gyr , while fixing the standard isochrone for the primary .",
    "we find that the differences in the apparent transit depth ratios between _ spitzer _  and _ kepler _  ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratiodepthd ] ) vary from 10 to 30% ( in absolute ) compared to the use of the standard isochrone for the secondary .",
    "this difference depends on the mass of the secondary and tertiary , and it is partially degenerate with distance , which is a free parameter here . in practice",
    ", this changes the blend frequency , and hence the fpp calculated in section  [ sec : fpp ] by only a small fraction . the impact on the choice of isochrone ages for the secondary has also been tested by  @xcite through the detailed study of the shape of transit light - curves using the blender framework .",
    "they find that the age of the secondary does not change significantly their estimate of the fpp .",
    "therefore , we conclude that using generic isochrones does not affect the overall conclusion of this paper that the fpr of our sample is low .",
    "@xcite perform detailed numerical simulations of the _ kepler _  targets to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives , and its dependence on spectral type , candidate planet size , and orbital period .",
    "they find that the global false positive rate of _ kepler _  is 9.4% , peaking for giant planets ( 622@xmath82 ) at 17.7% , reaching a low of 6.7% for small neptunes ( 24@xmath82 ) , and increasing again for earth - size planets ( 0.81.25@xmath82 ) to 12.3% .",
    "we compare these findings with the sample of candidates observed with _",
    "spitzer _",
    "that fall in a similar overall size range ( 1.2522@xmath82 ) .",
    "from the fpr estimated by @xcite , we can conclude that it would be extremely unlikely that we find no false positives in a random sample of 51 kois observed with _ spitzer_. the difference between our findings and the results from  @xcite is explained by the fact that our _ spitzer _  sample underwent a much more stringent vetting procedure than typical kois .",
    "indeed , the estimated fpp for our sample is lower than 8.8% at @xmath9 level .",
    "we now compare our findings to the study of  @xcite .",
    "these authors use the depths from the first 1235 kois reported from  @xcite together with generic assumptions and with the stellar population synthesis model trilegal  @xcite to derive the fpp of all kois .",
    "their result was updated in @xcite using the transit depths reported by  @xcite , and is based on 16 months of _ kepler",
    "_  observations .",
    "the main steps employed in the current paper are similar to their approach .",
    "one of the main differences is that we include color information on the transits depths , thanks to the _ spitzer _  observations ( depths and magnitudes ) .",
    "we also include constraints from direct imaging and centroids analyses when available .",
    "another difference is that our work focuses on a small number of kois , whereas  @xcite aim at evaluating the fpr of the complete sample of kois . despite these differences",
    ", we find that our study is in good agreement with the study from  @xcite .",
    "they predict that the fpr would be lower than 5% for half of the kois , and lower than 10% for most of them .",
    "their results are consistent with the value that we report from our independent observational survey .",
    "furthermore , we also find trends in agreement with their work for the fpp values as a function of galactic latitude and _ kepler _  magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : fppkpb ] ) .",
    "there are other observational projects that address the question of the fpr in _",
    "kepler_. the most comparable observational study to our project in terms of candidate sample size is the work of  @xcite .",
    "they find a relatively high value for the fpr of 34.8% @xmath83 6.5% for their sample of 33 kois .",
    "however , there are several important differences between our approach and the one employed by  @xcite .",
    "the first difference remains in the observational method that is used to constrain the fpp of individual targets .",
    "instead of using transit photometry , @xcite obtain radial velocity observations to establish the nature of the transiting candidates .",
    "the second important difference concerns the selection of the candidates considered for follow - up observations .",
    "they focus on the deepest short - period transit signals with high @xmath84 that _ kepler _  has detected .",
    "unlike for our study , @xcite restrict their targets to candidates with large transit depths that are greater than 0.4% , and with short orbital periods lower than 25 days , and with host stars brighter than _ kepler _  magnitude 14.7 .",
    "this selection is obviously driven by instrumental capabilities . instead , we select our candidates from a wider range of candidate sizes , orbital periods , and magnitudes that had been vetted by the _",
    "cfop_. moreover , some of the kois selected by  @xcite were noted as being slightly v - shaped from the _ kepler _  photometry in  @xcite , and these signals are considered as most likely due to ebs .",
    "we emphasize that the fpr is expected to be greater for larger transit depths .",
    "therefore , one should expect a higher fpr for the family of giant planets .",
    "the high fpr found in the sample of  @xcite is consistent with the findings of  @xcite for which close - in candidates were also targeted . @xcite",
    "refine the photometric transit light curve analysis of 115 kepler giant planet candidates based on photometric data from quarters q0 to q2 .",
    "these authors find that 14% of these candidates are likely false positives based on the detections of their secondary eclipses .",
    "ground - based telescopes are also employed to examine the status of false - positives of a few kois using the same technique that we present here , i.e. color photometry .",
    "@xcite use the _ gtc _ telescope and observe transits of four short - period ( p@xmath796 days ) planet candidates .",
    "however , we note that the color photometric approach with ground - based instruments is limited to short period candidates for which the transit can be observed during the course of the night . furthermore , the amplitude of the color - dependent effects for false positive detection increases as the two bandpasses under consideration are further removed in wavelength .",
    "therefore , _ spitzer _  is better adapted compared to ground - based photometric false - positive searches .",
    "we present the results from two large observational campaigns , which were conducted with the _ spitzer _  space telescope , dedicated to estimating the _ false positive rate _ amongst a sample of _ kepler _  candidates .",
    "we select a sub - sample of 51 candidates , spanning wide ranges in stellar , orbital and planetary parameter space , and we observe their transits with _ spitzer _  at 4.5  .",
    "we measure the transit depths of these candidates in the _ spitzer _  bandpass and compare them to the depths measured with _ kepler_. this technique allows us to derive the probability that a false - positive ( blended eclipsing binaries ) could mimic the transit - shape signal .",
    "we estimate that 85% of the kois from this sample have measured _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  depths which agree at better than @xmath9 level .",
    "we use the _ spitzer _  observations to remove most of the red - dwarfs that could potentially remain as false positives . by combining _ spitzer _  and follow - up observations , we estimate that the overall false positive rate of our sample is estimated to be 1.3% , and lower than 8.8% at 99.7% of confidence .",
    "this rate implies that the vetting procedures of the _ kepler _  data likely rule out a larger fraction of blends . extrapolating the empirical knowledge gained from this small sample to the overall _ kepler _  sample of candidates , we find that the overall false positive rate of the _ kepler _  sample is small . in this context , at least 90% of the _ kepler _  signals could be of planetary origin .",

    "<S> nasa s _ kepler _  mission has provided several thousand transiting planet candidates during the four years of its nominal mission , yet only a small subset of these candidates have been confirmed as true planets . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fraction of _ bona fide _ planets . estimating the rate of _ false positives _ of the overall _ kepler _  sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the results from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the _ spitzer _  </S>",
    "<S> space telescope during the the _ kepler _  mission . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are dedicated to estimating the _ false positive rate _ ( fpr ) amongst the _ kepler _  candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we select a sub - sample of 51 candidates , spanning wide ranges in stellar , orbital and planetary parameter space , and we observe their transits with _ spitzer _  at 4.5  . </S>",
    "<S> we use these observations to measures the candidate s transit depths and infrared magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> an authentic planet produces an achromatic transit depth ( neglecting the modest effect of limb darkening ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely a bandpass - dependent depth alerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source of the observed eclipse : a false - positive scenario .    for most of the candidates ( 85% ) , the transit depths measured with _ </S>",
    "<S> _  are consistent with the transit depths measured with _ spitzer _  as expected for planetary objects , while we find that the most discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that dilute the photometry . </S>",

    "<S> constraints on their own yield fprs between 5 - 40% , depending on the kois . by considering the population of the _ kepler _  field stars , and by combining follow - up observations ( imaging ) when available , we find that the overall fpr of our sample is low </S>",
    "<S> . the measured upper limit on the fpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this observational result , which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that is not investigated by the _ kepler _  </S>",
    "<S> observations , provides an independent indication that _ kepler _ s false positive rate is low . </S>"
