    "there are only two instances in modern cosmology in which a genuine theoretical prediction has been directly confirmed by observation .",
    "the first of these was the theoretical prediction obtained directly from the solution of einstein s equations by friedmann ( 1922 ) and later lemaitre ( 1927 ) that the universe is expanding ( hubble 1929 ) .",
    "the second was the theoretical prediction made in the framework of the original steady - state cosmology ( bondi and gold 1948 ; hoyle 1948 ) that the universe should be accelerating .",
    "this has been demonstrated in modern times by perlmutter et al ( 1999 ) and by riess et al ( 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately while the latter was a clear cut theoretical prediction , the observers almost unanimously have chosen to interpret their detection of acceleration by maintaining the ( standard ) and highly popular big bang model ( sbbc ) explaining the acceleration in terms of a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "because of this lack of balance in the discussion and the interpretation of the acceleration , we finally published a paper ( banerjee et al 2000 ) showing that the observational data available up to that time can very reasonably be interpreted in terms of the quasi - steady state cosmological ( qssc ) model . in this model",
    "we had shown that the qssc model provides a good fit to the above data provided one takes account of the absorption of light by intergalactic dust in the form of metallic whiskers .",
    "dust of this kind is required by the qssc model to explain the cosmic microwave background ( hoyle , burbidge and narlikar 1994@xmath0 , 2000 ) .",
    "since that paper was published , new data have been obtained ( riess et al 2001 ) involving a type ia supernova at a much higher redshift .    in order to give some level of balance to the claim that is now being associated with these discoveries ( cf .",
    "flippenko 2001 ) , in this paper we extend our earlier discussion to see how well ( or how badly ) the quasi - steady state model fits the new data . however , we first begin with a short discussion of why the cosmological constant currently enjoys so much popularity .",
    "the recent popularity of the cosmological constant with the proponents of standard cosmology rests on the following aspects : + 1 .",
    "the constraints of ` age ' are relaxed . by choosing a @xmath1",
    "suitably it is possible to increase the age of the universe .",
    "thus the age of a standard flat @xmath2 model is @xmath3 yrs , for @xmath4 , which is too low for accommodating globular cluster ages of @xmath5 yrs , for @xmath6 . by way of comparison ,",
    "the age of a flat model with @xmath7 is @xmath8 yrs , for @xmath9 . at the same time",
    "it should be stressed that the choice @xmath10 is rather arbitrary .",
    "while there are those who strongly advocate the model with this value , there is compelling evidence from saha et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that @xmath11 .",
    "the use of @xmath1 allows the metric distance to any given redshift to be larger than the corresponding distance ( for the same redshift ) for the @xmath12 model .",
    "this was demonstrated very clearly by the magnitude - redshift relation for type ia supernovae .",
    "the excess faintness of supernovae ( over the predictions of the @xmath2 friedmann models ) was interpreted as the proof of a non - zero , positive @xmath13 .",
    "indirect checks on @xmath14 are provided by the structure formation scenarios and the observed inhomogeneities of the cosmic microwave background . here",
    "the choice of a non - zero @xmath1 helps by expanding the parameter space and thereby relieving pressures on structure formation scenarios from the various observational constraints . for a review of these and other observational constraints",
    "see bagla eta al ( 1996 ) and narlikar and padmanabhan ( 2001 ) .",
    "if one insists on a flat model ( @xmath15 as is implied by most kinds of inflation@xmath15 ) , the observed baryonic density of matter is only a few percent of the total cosmological density . in that case",
    "the rest ( @xmath16 90% ) of all matter has to be dark and probably non - baryonic .",
    "the requirement of locating and identifying so much of matter in this dark and esoteric form is not so severe if we assume that a substantial part of it is taken over by @xmath1 and is called ` dark energy ' or ` quintessence ' .",
    "although the problem of bridging the gap between the predicted and the observed still remains , the gap is now to be explained more easily by an ` intangible ' dark energy than by a more tangible dark matter particle .",
    "the gifts brought by the cosmological constant come accompanied by a few unwelcome effects too .",
    "we name a few below .    \\1 . with the popularity of the inflationary model ,",
    "the cosmological constant found a new life with its claimed origin in the force generated by transitions of the vacuum .",
    "it is this force that is supposed to drive the universe in a transient de sitter - like mode .",
    "it is tempting to suppose that the present @xmath1 owes its origin to the inflationary phase .",
    "however , weinberg ( 1989 ) has commented on the extremely low value of @xmath1 as required by the present cosmological observations compared to the primordial scenarios that drove the universe into an inflationary mode .",
    "if the inflation took place at the gut epoch , the present value of @xmath1 is too low by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "if the inflation took place at the quantum gravity epoch , the above factor is lower still at @xmath18 .",
    "it is easier to suppose that after inflation was over , the cosmological constant dropped to zero , rather than try to explain why we see its relic at such a low but highly fine - tuned value .",
    "one may recall that ` fine - tuning ' was a defect of the standard model , that the idea of inflation was invented to correct . to rationalize fine tuning , models with @xmath19 , @xmath20 or with @xmath21",
    "have been considered by vishwakarma ( 2001 ) to allow for a steady drop of @xmath1 from its high primordial value to the presently claimed low value .",
    "these models have a somewhat ad - hoc nature and certainly do not share the elegance of the overall structure of general relativity .    \\2 .",
    "although it is tempting to place a larger and larger fraction of the total energy in the @xmath1 - basket , beyond a certain level the exercise proves counter - productive .",
    "the stretching of space because of a large @xmath1 makes gravitational lensing of large redshift objects , a much more frequent phenomenon than is observationally allowed .",
    "the presently favoured value of @xmath22 is already bursting through this limit , and anything in excess may not be tolerated by the lensing data ( falco , kochanek and munoz , 1998 )    \\3 .",
    "if one uses the ` best fit to observations ' as a criterion for estimating @xmath1 , then the angular size - redshift relation for ultra compact radio sources ( jackson and dodgeson 1997 ) implies that @xmath23 .",
    "there is thus a contradiction between two cosmological tests of the universe going to large redshifts : the @xmath24-@xmath25 relation gives @xmath26 whereas the @xmath27-@xmath25 relation requires @xmath28 for best - fit model .",
    "given the uncertainties surrounding the cosmological ` standard candle ' and ` standard rulers ' , we feel that the current enthusiasm for a positive cosmological constant may be premature .",
    "if one is willing to move out of the framework of the standard cosmology , the quasi - steady state cosmology ( qssc ) provides an already existing framework to understand the above cosmological issues .",
    "we briefly describe the salient features of this cosmology before coming to these specific issues .",
    "the qssc is a non - singular cosmology which arises from a machian theory of gravity that gives field equations more general than general relativity ( hoyle , burbidge and narlikar 1995 ) .",
    "the equations are :    @xmath29.\\ ] ]    here we have taken the speed of light @xmath30 and the first term on the right hand side is the usual energy momentum tensor of matter , which , in the case of `` dust '' ( pressure @xmath31 with density @xmath32 and flow vector @xmath33 , becomes    @xmath34    while the second term on the right hand side denotes the contribution from a traceless scalar field @xmath35 of _ negative _ energy and stresses with gradient @xmath36 :    @xmath37.\\ ] ]    the coupling constant @xmath38 is positive ; but with its negative coupling to gravity or spacetime geometry , it generates repulsion and _ accelerated _ expansion of spacetime .",
    "we should point out here that the cosmological constant @xmath1 in this theory arises from a machian interaction and _ its sign is negative_.    for quantitative details of this model , see the paper cited above ( hoyle , burbidge and narlikar 1995 ) .",
    "general solutions of these equations in the homogeneous - isotropic case were obtained by sachs , narlikar and hoyle ( 1996 ) .",
    "the qssc generally uses the simplest of these , which has a @xmath39 ( flat ) robertson - walker spacetime with a scale factor given by    @xmath40.\\ ] ]    in this expression the function @xmath41 is very close to @xmath42 , except near the maxima and minima of the scale factor .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote respectively the characteristic time scale of the exponential expansion and the time period of one cycle , while the parameter @xmath45 satisfies the inequality    @xmath46    evidently for @xmath47 , the scale factor describes a universe with a long term exponential expansion together with short term oscillations in which @xmath48 never reaches the value zero .",
    "the details of this cosmology are found in various papers by hoyle , burbidge and narlikar ( 1993 , 1994 a , b , 1995 ) as well as in their book ( _ op.cit .",
    ", _ 2000 ) .",
    "the long term expansion in this model is accelerated , as in the original steady state theory .",
    "the repulsive force generated by the @xmath49field is responsible for this feature .",
    "however , the @xmath49field plays the crucial role of creating new matter _ without violating any conservation law_. although the scale factor describes a smoothed out universe , in actuality the creation is in the form of mini - explosions triggered by the strong gravitational fields of highly collapsed ( black - hole like ) objects .",
    "it is claimed that the creation phenomenon occurs at various mass scales , ranging from the stellar to the supercluster scales .    within the framework of the qssc ,",
    "the cosmic microwave background is explained as the thermalized relic starlight from previous cycles .",
    "the thermal temperature can indeed be worked out in terms of the known stellar activity and its present value can be derived as @xmath50k .",
    "how is thermalization achieved ?",
    "the proposed mechanism is via metallic whiskers ( narlikar , et al 1997 ) which form a component of intergalactic dust .",
    "the formation and extinction properties of these whiskers have been discussed in the above paper .",
    "typically the whiskers form from the metallic vapours ejected from supernovae where the metals are synthesized .",
    "experiments have shown that metallic vapours on cooling , condense into elongated whiskers of @xmath51 mm length and @xmath52 cm cross - sectional radius ( donn and sears , 1963 ; nabarro and jackson , 1958 ) .",
    "it is estimated that a dust density of @xmath53 g @xmath54 is adequate to achieve the above effect .",
    "this model can also explain the observed anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background , including the peak at @xmath55 normally referred to as the doppler peak in standard cosmology ( narlikar , et al 2002 ) .",
    "indeed it is this type of dust that helps explain the magnitude - redshift relation for extragalactic type ia supernovae .",
    "from the above discussion , it is evident that three new aspects are introduced by the qssc vis - a - vis standard cosmology when interpreting the @xmath24-@xmath25 relation .",
    "there should be : + ( i ) a negative cosmological constant , + ( ii ) a repulsive force arising from a negative energy @xmath35-field , + ( iii ) cosmic dust which extinguishes radiation travelling over long distances",
    ".    of these ( i ) tends to decelerate the universe , while ( ii ) tends to accelerate it .",
    "the effect of ( iii ) , so far as the type ia supernova @xmath24-@xmath25 test is concerned , is to make the distant supernovae progressively dimmer .",
    "the effective magnitude - redshift relation is given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the absolute luminosity of the source and the luminosity distance @xmath59 is measured in mpc .",
    "here we have used the notation and definitions of perlmutter , et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 has been referred to by these authors as ` hubble constant free ' absolute magnitude .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of this equation is the standard luminosity distance @xmath61 term which can be computed for the qssc .",
    "the product @xmath62 is independent of hubble s constant .",
    "the last term denotes the dimming produced by the intergalactic dust and may be explicitly written as :    @xmath63    where , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the three parameters of this cosmology corresponding to the cosmological constant , matter density and the @xmath49field energy density .",
    "@xmath67 km s@xmath68 mpc@xmath68 is the present value of hubble s constant .",
    "the density @xmath69 is the present intergalactic dust grain density in the form of metallic whiskers and @xmath70 is the mass absorption coefficient .",
    "chitre and narlikar ( 1976 ) were the first to discuss the role of intergalactic dust in the @xmath24-@xmath25 relation . at the time",
    "the general belief about the intergalactic medium did not include dust as a significant component and so the suggestion in the above paper that presence of even a small dust - component would enhance the apparent magnitudes was largely ignored .",
    "recently aquirre ( 1999 ) considered the role of dust in the @xmath24-@xmath25 relation , followed by banerjee , et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "a comment is necessary on eq ( 7 ) . in the paper by banerjee ,",
    "et al ( 2000 ) this formula had appeared with a typographical error , with the factor @xmath71 missing in the numerator .",
    "the factor was nevertheless included in the actual calculation .",
    "the calculation redone by vishwakarma ( 2002 ) has slightly lowered the value of @xmath72 per degree of freedom from @xmath731.06 to @xmath731.00 , thus marginally improving upon the goodness of fit claimed originally by banerjee , et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we use this formula to compute the @xmath24-@xmath25 curve as predicted by the qssc . as reported by vishwakarma ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the calculation is done in two different ways .",
    "the first is to use the low - redshift measurements to determine the two free parameters in equation ( 6 ) , viz . @xmath60 and @xmath74 , and then use these values to calculate @xmath72 from the high - redshift measurements including sn 1997ff , the highest redshift supernova observed so far .",
    "note that the model considered here is completely determined by @xmath75 and @xmath76 as considered by banerjee , et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "the second method is to use the supernova 1997ff along with the earlier 60 supernovae , taking the high- and low - redshift points together , to get a best fit curve and then judge the goodness of fit .",
    "if the fit is relatively good , one can argue for the robustness of the theoretical relation .",
    "a)_method 1 _ : using the earlier work of banerjee , et al ( 2000 ) we carry out the calculation of magnitudes at specified redshifts , using equation ( 6 ) .",
    "six of the sixty supernovae were dropped from the calculation as the deviations of the observed magnitudes from the expected ones are somewhat excessive .",
    "we will comment on this deviation within the framework of the qssc later . for the present we may mention that data on similar six supernovae had been omitted in obtaining the best - fit models of standard cosmology by perlmutter , et al ( 1999 ) who had also considered 54 supernovae in their primary fit c.    with the constraint @xmath77 , the sample of 16 low redshift supernovae gives @xmath78 with a wide range @xmath79 as the best - fitting solution , where @xmath72 does not change significantly .",
    "for example , @xmath80 with @xmath81 gives a value @xmath72 per degree of freedom of 0.8 which represents an excellent fit .",
    "to fix ideas , @xmath82 gives the corresponding absolute magnitude at peak luminosity of the supernova as @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath9 .",
    "these values are in the right region for sn peak magnitudes ( saha , et al 2001 ) .",
    "when we add the new point sn 1997ff ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) to the older list of 38 high redshift supernovae with @xmath88 , the new sample gives a @xmath72 per degree of freedom of 1.49 which , though larger than before , is still acceptable as a reasonable fit .",
    "it would be worthwhile to mention that the supernova 1997ff is claimed to be on the brighter side due to gravitational lensing effect ( moertell et al , 2000 ) .",
    "if this is the case then an increase in the measured apparent magnitude of this supernova by only as much as 0.5 improves the fit considerably by giving @xmath72 per degree of freedom of 1.22 .",
    "likewise , a change in the redshift of this farthest supernova from 1.755 to 1.65 improves the @xmath72 per degree of freedom to 1.33 .",
    "we demonstrate this to underscore the need for caution in interpreting data in terms of models till ( a ) we have data on more supernovae available and ( b ) we are more certain about their magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "\\b ) _ method 2 _ : here we include the supernovae 1997ff along with the 54 supernovae from earlier samples in obtaining the best - fit curve .",
    "naturally the fit of such a curve to the data will be better than that in the first case .",
    "here we report an exercise carried out by one of us ( vishwakarma , 2002 ) in which the models are fitted in the qssc parameter space of @xmath89 and @xmath69 in the range @xmath90 g @xmath54 .",
    "the region enclosed by the tilted u - shaped curve in figure 1 , has the qssc models with parameters that yield values of @xmath72 per degree of freedom in the range 1.16 to 1.26 , that is , values indicating a satisfactory fit .",
    "even the model chosen by banerjee et al ( 2000 ) , viz .",
    "@xmath91 yields a reasonable fit with the @xmath72 value per degree of freedom of 1.27 . moreover , if we assume that the supernova 1997ff is observed on the brighter side , as we have mentioned earlier , then an increase in its magnitude by 0.5 improves the @xmath72 per degree of freedom to 1.12 .",
    "likewise , a change in its redshift from 1.755 to 1.65 reduces the @xmath72 per degree of freedom to 1.19 . in figure 2 , we have shown the fitting of this model ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 with @xmath72 per degree of freedom @xmath92 ) to the observed data points and compared it with the favoured standard big bang model ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the perlmutter et al data taken together with sn 1997ff , do not give the standard flat model as the best - fitting model : there the best - fitting model is obtained with @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) with a @xmath72 value per degree of freedom of 1.09 . however , if we concentrate our attention on the flat model ( @xmath97 ) , which is currently favoured , the minimum @xmath72 is obtained for the model @xmath98 with a @xmath72 value per degree of freedom of 1.17 ( vishwakarma , 2002 ) .    refering back to our opening remarks in this paper , it is interesting to compare the old steady state model with the classical einstein desitter model ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) for the data of perlmutter , et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "the respective value of @xmath72 per degree of freedom for the steady state model is 1.42 , compared to the value 1.75 for the einstein desitter model .",
    "this relative performance may be contrasted with the situation prevailing three decades ago when the @xmath24-@xmath25 data on galaxies were claimed to support a _ decelerating _ universe and were used to rule out the steady state model on the grounds that the model predicts an _ accelerating _ universe .",
    "as was originally stated by banerjee , et al ( 2000 ) , the adjustable parameter in the above exercise is @xmath69 , the density of intergalactic dust . by requiring the fit to be ` best ' we determine the value of @xmath69 .",
    "had the theory been on the wrong track , this value could have come out vastly different from the value needed to thermalize the microwave background .",
    "that it comes out in the correct range must be considered a point in favour of this approach",
    ".    it will take us too far from the focus of the present paper to elaborate on the details of the microwave background in the qssc . in a separate paper ( narlikar , et al 2002 ) devoted to the spectrum and fluctuations of the mbr in the qssc",
    "we have shown that the mbr anisotropy from rich clusters can be revealed by a peak in the power spectrum around @xmath101 while smaller peaks are revealed in the @xmath102 range from groups of galaxies and perhaps weaker peaks at @xmath103 from individual galaxies or compact groups .    in the qssc , the whisker dust is produced and ejected from the vicinity of supernovae , as discussed by narlikar et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus it is quite likely that dust near the parent supernova may show varying degree of concentration .",
    "this can lead to relatively large fluctuations in the supernova magnitudes , and may account for the large deviations for the six supernovae omitted from the study .    in principle , despite such fluctuations , it is possible to use the @xmath104 test to distinguish between the standard @xmath1-based approach and the above qssc approach . as we go to higher redshifts ,",
    "the effect of acceleration as implied by the cosmological constant will diminish , while that of the intergalactic dust will become greater .",
    "however , great care needs to be exercised before drawing any conclusions from such observations . as the example of the @xmath104 test for galaxies showed in the 1970s ,",
    "uncertain evolutionary effects tend to dominate at high redshifts .",
    "in addition , we have seen that even small changes in the measured values of @xmath24 or @xmath25 can greatly alter the conclusion .",
    "finally , as we go to higher redshifts , gravitational lensing may selectively amplify the images and thus push the observed brightness to values higher than normal ( lewis and ibata 2001 ) .",
    "hence it is prudent to await the accumulation of more type ia supernovae in the high-@xmath25 basket .",
