    "there is compelling evidence from astrophysical and cosmological data that the dominant component of the matter in the universe is in the form of  dark matter \" that only interacts very weakly with ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the standard cosmological model is that the dark matter density today is comparable with that of the baryons ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "such a fact could be naturally explained by an asymmetry in dark matter similar to that in baryons @xcite .",
    "though higher or lower masses are possible @xcite , the asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) models prefer to have dm mass @xmath5 gev @xcite , which is within the inferred mass range ( @xmath3 gev ) of the dark matter candidates found by dama @xcite and cogent @xcite , where @xmath6 is the mass of neutrons . in the adm scenarios , despite the dm particles can in principle have weak - scale interactions and therefore sizable scattering cross sections off baryons , annihilations do not occur because of the presence of an asymmetry in the dm sector between particles and anti - particles .",
    "therefore the adm particles can be captured by astrophysical bodies such as the sun , earth , white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the captured particles will eventually be thermalized and centered in the core of the star , namely , a dense dark matter core forms @xcite . due to the non - annihilation of adm particles ,",
    "the build up of a concentration at the center of neutron stars may lead up to a collapse of these particles into a small black hole and the neutron star may be destroyed .",
    "if the central temperature of very old isolated neutron stars falls below the critical temperature to form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , the bosonic particles in the ground state condense and no longer follow the thermal distribution .",
    "consequently the process of collapse will be significantly enhanced",
    ". therefore the existence of very old neutron stars in the galaxy imposes a valid constraint on non - annihilating bosonic weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . in the initial work by goldman and nussinov @xcite",
    "a mass larger than @xmath7 has been excluded . in other words ,",
    "the preferred adm models with a mass @xmath2 gev can not be non - annihilating and bosonic .",
    "such a result is a piece of evidence that the compact objects can be valuable probe of the physical properties of dark matter particles .",
    "recently , after taking into account the hawking evaporation of the newly - formed small black hole @xcite , kouvaris and tinyakov @xcite have shown that the non - interacting adm particles can be bosonic as long as they have a mass @xmath8 gev , i.e. , the allowed mass range of non - interacting bosonic adm particles has been considerably extended .",
    "such a progress is remarkable but the @xmath3 gev range favored by dama and cogent has still been excluded . in this work we show that with the advanced estimate of hawking evaporation rate @xcite as well as the rate of accretion onto the black holes formed at the center of neutron stars , asymmetric bosonic non - interacting dark matter with a mass @xmath9 gev is viable , which covers the most interesting regions , including the preferred adm mass @xmath2 gev as well as the @xmath3 gev range favored by dama and cogent .",
    "we also find that the asymmetric bosonic non - interacting dark matter particles with a mass above @xmath1 tev has been excluded by current neutron star observations .",
    "wimps scatter with nuclei and then lose their kinetic energy when pass through a star .",
    "if the kinetic energy is smaller than the stellar gravitational potential the dark matter particles will get captured @xcite and concentrate in the center within the radius @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the temperature ( density ) of the star core . through this work",
    "we denote @xmath13 and @xmath14 k.    the mass of the ordinary matter contained in such a volume is @xmath15 the mass of the captured dark matter can be estimated as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy density of dark matter surrounding the neutron star , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the spin - independent cross section of the dark matter scattering with the neutron / proton .      for bosonic wimps , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) may be formed .",
    "since such a state is more compact , the self - gravitation regime starts much earlier .",
    "the particle density required to form bec is @xmath20 and the total mass of the needed particles is @xmath21    the size of the condensed state is determined by the radius of the wave function of the wimp ground state in the gravitational potential of the star , i.e. , @xmath22 which is much smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "the self - gravitation regime reaches for a mass of the condensed matter @xmath24    for non - interacting bosons only the uncertainty principle opposes the collapse . as long as the mass of self - gravitating bosons reaches @xcite @xmath25 they will collapse into a black hole , where @xmath26 gev is the planck mass . for @xmath27 kev that is of our interest , @xmath28 .",
    "hence it is @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 that provides a key constraint on the mass of bosonic non - interacting adm .    for a black hole to form , the condition either @xmath31 or @xmath32 should be satisfied .",
    "the request @xmath33 suggests that the neutron star should have an age @xmath34 . while @xmath35 requires @xmath36 and then @xmath37 .",
    "current observations of nearby highly magnetized neutron stars suggest that these objects usually cool down to a surface temperature @xmath38 k ( correspondingly @xmath39 k if the relation @xmath40^{0.455}$ ] @xcite still holds , where @xmath41 is the surface gravity of the neutron star ) in a timescale @xmath42 yrs @xcite . if such objects can be identified in regions with @xmath43 , one has @xmath44 mev .    for adm particles lighter than @xmath45 ,",
    "it is rather hard to have @xmath32 .",
    "for example even with very extreme parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 yrs and @xmath48 k , we have @xmath49 , which is still smaller than @xmath50 . therefore current neutron star observations are _ not _ against the kev to sub - gev non - interacting bosonic adm and the future observations of highly magnetized neutron star in dense dark matter region may exclude the mass range from sub - mev to sub - gev .",
    "after its formation , whether the black hole can survive or not depends on the competition between hawking evaporation and simultaneous accretion of the surrounding material .",
    "let s discuss these two processes in some detail .",
    "* the hawking radiation * mimics thermal emission from a blackbody with a finite size and a temperature of @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass of the black hole . the mass - loss rate of an evaporating black hole can be expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 accounts for degrees of freedom of each species of radiated particles and can be estimated with eq.(9 ) of @xcite .",
    "when the temperature of the black hole exceeds the quark - gluon deconfinement temperature ( @xmath55 mev ) , the quark , gluon and lighter particles will be emitted .",
    "hence the mass loss rate can be considerably larger than the estimate @xmath56 adopted in both @xcite and @xcite , where @xmath57 is newton s constant , @xmath58 is the speed of light and @xmath59 is the reduced planck s constant .    *",
    "bondi accretion onto black hole * has been widely discussed since 1952 @xcite . for current purpose",
    "we need to take the relativistic approach . following appendix g of @xcite , the rate of accretion of rest mass onto the black hole",
    "is @xmath60 ( independent of the radius @xmath61 to the black hole ) , where @xmath62 is the baryon number density and @xmath63 is the inward radial velocity component . to calculate an explicit value for @xmath64 , we need to adopt an equation of state and take it to be @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the pressure . in @xcite , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "are assumed to be constant .",
    "currently the density is so high that the equation of state likely changes when @xmath62 reaches a critical value . for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "motivated by the latest astrophysical measurement on the equation of state of the ultra - dense material in neutron stars @xcite we take @xmath71 . at @xmath72 , @xmath73 and",
    "quark matter likely forms ( the temperature is denoted as @xmath74 ) , for which @xmath75 and the sound speed is @xmath76 .",
    "the energy density ( baryon number density ) is proportional to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . adopting eq.(g.17 ) of @xcite , at the critical radius @xmath79",
    ", we have @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . hence the relativistic bernoulli equation ( i.e. , eq.(g.22 ) of @xcite ) gives @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and then @xmath84 our accretion rate is lower than the preliminary estimate with classical bondi accretion formula @xcite by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "+ the black hole will disappear as long as @xmath85 , such a request defines a critical mass of the black hole , i.e. , @xmath86 the hawking temperature is @xmath87 mev , for which @xmath88 .",
    "the mass of the dark matter particles should satisfy ( i.e. , eq.([eq : m_c ] ) ) @xmath89 otherwise the black hole will be bigger and bigger and finally the whole neutron star is destroyed .",
    "very old neutron stars will be destroyed too if bec does not form ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) but the self - gravitating dark matter core is massive enough for black hole to form ( i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the existence of old neutron stars in the galaxy thus imposes a tight constraint on the heavy adm model @xcite . in this case",
    "the request @xmath92 usually does not provide us new information and we focus on the first two requests , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 therefore we need @xmath95 . due to the relatively fixed @xmath12 and the reverse sign of the indices of @xmath96 and @xmath97 on @xmath98 , @xmath17 , @xmath99 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath100 reaches the minimum when @xmath101 , for which we have @xmath102 and then @xmath103 since @xmath104 , for the extreme parameters @xmath105 and @xmath47 yrs , the above constraint yields that @xmath106 gev .",
    "however , such a tight constraint is not reachable because the required @xmath11 is high up to @xmath107 k , which is impossible for a neutron star as old as the universe .",
    "nevertheless , even in such an extreme scenario , the resulting @xmath108 gev is far larger than @xmath109 gev , demonstrating that _ the window for non - interacting bosonic asymmetric dark matter models does open . _",
    "for isolated neutron stars , with the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 to form a black hole , @xmath112 should satisfy @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 . among the parameters involved in the above equation , @xmath110 , @xmath17 and @xmath99",
    "are measurable , and @xmath12 and @xmath41 are relatively well determined .",
    "so the tightest constraint on @xmath117 is achievable .",
    "the cooling of neutron stars is still to be better understood .",
    "the fit to the surface temperature of the best studied isolated neutron stars suggests that for a mass @xmath118 , one likely has @xmath119 k ( @xmath120 k ) at @xmath42 yrs ( @xmath121 yrs ) @xcite .",
    "with eq.([eq : t_s ] ) we have @xmath122 at a time @xmath123 yrs .",
    "the existence of isolated neutron stars older than @xmath124 yrs thus requires that @xmath125 otherwise such stars will have been destroyed by the black hole formed at their center ( the formed black hole has a mass @xmath126 gev , for which the mass loss due to hawking evaporation is too small to balance the bondi accretion .",
    "it is straightforward to show this with the formulae presented in section ii a ) .     and",
    "@xmath19 for isolated neutron stars at local dm density @xmath127 .",
    "the left exclusion region is the case of j0108 - 1431 ( @xmath128 yrs and @xmath129 k @xcite ) while the right exclusion region is based on eq.([eq : constraint - tev]).,width=362 ]",
    "for the bosonic non - interacting asymmetric dark matter particles , the build up of a concentration at the center of neutron stars may lead up to a collapse of these particles into a small black hole and the neutron star may be destroyed .",
    "therefore the existence of old neutron stars in the galaxy imposes a tight constraint on such a kind of dark matter , as firstly noticed in 1989 @xcite .",
    "a robust constraint is however not achievable until the hawking evaporation of the newly - formed small black hole and the simultaneous accretion have been properly addressed .",
    "we find out that in previous works the hawking evaporation rate has been underestimated while the bondi accretion rate has been overestimated ( see section ii a for the details ) .",
    "after the corrections , the asymmetric bosonic non - interacting dark matter with a mass @xmath130 gev is found to be viable .",
    "we also show that for @xmath131 tev , the black hole can form ( without reaching the bose - einstein condensation regime ) and swallow the neutron star .",
    "interestingly , even in the most - extreme / unrealistic scenario , we have @xmath108 gev , which is much larger than @xmath109 gev , demonstrating that there is indeed a nice window for non - interacting bosonic asymmetric dark matter models ( see section ii b for the details ) .",
    "we conclude that the asymmetric non - annihilating bosonic dark matter is viable if its mass is in the range from @xmath0 gev to @xmath1 tev , which covers the most attractive regions , including the preferred asymmetric dark matter mass @xmath2 gev as well as the @xmath3 gev range favored by dama and cogent ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find out that current neutron star observations are _ not _ against the kev to sub - gev non - interacting bosonic adm and the future observations of magnetized neutron star in dense dark matter region may exclude the mass range from sub - mev to sub - gev ( see eq.([eq : m_low ] ) and the subsequent two paragraphs for the discussion ) .",
