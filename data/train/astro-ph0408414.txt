    "the detection of fe k-@xmath24 x - ray lines can play an important role in understanding the nature of grb .",
    "it may provide insights into the nature and details of the grb progenitor , e.g. through possible differences in the line properties of short grbs and long grbs . while long grbs are convincingly associated with the collapse of massive stars , short grbs are , lacking other evidence ,",
    "largely believed to arise from compact star mergers such as ns / ns or ns / bh systems .",
    "thus in short bursts one might expect an ambient gas density which is lower , and a stellar remnant or stellar funnel which is more compact than in the long burst case . in the latter",
    ", the explosion may be expected to take place in a higher density medium , e.g. a star forming region , or the pre - burst wind of the progenitor , and the progenitor is spatially more extended .    in the case of long grbs ,",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for generating iron lines . these fall mainly into two categories : distant reprocessor or nearby reprocessor models .",
    "both of them assume photoionization and reprocessing by a stellar remnant medium outside the source of continuum photons associated with the afterglow .",
    "in the distant models , based on the supranova paradigm , the x - rays from the burst and early afterglow emission illuminate iron - rich material at a distance of @xmath25 which is outside the fireball region , deposited there by a supernova explosion occurring months before the grb event ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case",
    ", the line intensity variations are thought to be due to light travel time effects between the grb and the reprocessor .",
    "alternatively , in the nearby reprocessor models , the line emission is attributed to the interaction of a long lasting outflow from the central engine with the progenitor stellar envelope at distances @xmath26 ( rees & 2000 ; & rees 2001 ; bttcher & fryer 2001 ) . in this case ,",
    "line variations are attributed to changes or decay of the photoionizing radiation continuum or jet .",
    "therefore , iron emission line feature ( e.g. equivalent width ( @xmath27 ) ) produced by the different mechanisms will be different ( ballantyne , et al .",
    "2002 , kallman et al . , 2002 ) .    among the well - localized grbs , @xmath28 90% have x - ray afterglows and about 60% of bursts with x - ray afterglow detections",
    "are also detected in the optical band .",
    "however the other 40% are optically dark . in several cases ( e.g. grb 970508 , grb 970828 , grb 991216 , grb990705 ) ,",
    "the x - ray redshifts derived from the iron lines were consistent with those from optical spectroscopy of the host galaxy ( piro 2002 ) .",
    "this shows that measurements of the redshift by x - ray spectroscopy is more than mere a possibility , and can provide reliable results , which is particularly interesting when the optical spectroscopy is difficult or non - existent , as in dark bursts .",
    "the possible role of iron lines in tracing the high redshift universe has been discussed by & rees ( 2003 ) , ghisellini et al ( 1999 ) and others . since",
    "little absorption is expected from either our galaxy or the intergalactic medium in the x - ray band above @xmath29 kev , one can expect the fe k-@xmath24 line to be in principle detectable up to redshifts 30 , if grb are present there and if the signal to noise ratio is sufficient for a given spectrometric instrument .",
    "it is this latter question which we address here .",
    "so far , 5 iron line features have been detected : grb 970508 ( piro et al .",
    "1999 , bepposax ) , grb 970828 ( yoshida et al . 1999 ,",
    "asca ) , grb 990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 , bepposax , prompt x - ray emission ) , grb 991216 ( piro et al .",
    "2000 , chandra ) , grb 000214 ( antonelli et al .",
    "2000 , bepposax ) .",
    "however , almost all of them are detected marginally .",
    "a compilation of the significance levels is grb 970508 : @xmath30 ( 99.3% ) ; grb 970828:@xmath31 ( 98.3% ) ; grb 990705 : @xmath32 ( 95.6% ) ( based on the fit results of amati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and our own ) ; grb 991216 , piro et al .",
    ": @xmath33 ( 99.5% ) ; ballantyne et al .",
    ": @xmath34 ( 98% ) ; grb 000214 : 3@xmath35 . because of the low signal to noise in these previous observations , it is difficult to differentiate between the two main classes of line production models .",
    "one example here is grb 991216 , for which piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that it can be explained well by a distant reprocessor model , whereas ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argued that it could be explained in a reflected emission model too , which is compatible with the nearby model .",
    "thus , the detection of higher signal to noise line features is necessary .",
    "this would be necessary also in order to have some confidence in the utility of the lines as redshift tracers .    in a number of other bursts ,",
    "several low z ( ionic charge ) lines have been reported with xmm ( reeves et al .",
    "2002 ; watson et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; see also table 1 in obrian et al . ( 2003 ) for the summary of all detected low z x - ray lines ) .",
    "the non - detection of iron lines at a significant level in these same objects by xmm , and the non - detection of significant lower z elements in the objects where chandra detected fe lines , is an interesting question which remains to be clarified .",
    "observations at an earlier phase of the afterglow , when the lines may be easier to detect , could throw light on this question .",
    "swift , due for launch in late 2004 , has spectral capabilities and a very short slewing time ( @xmath36 minute ) .",
    "thus , if strong enough lines are produced at minutes to hours , as many @xmath37 bursts with lines might be detected with higher signal to noise ratio than heretofore . on the other hand , the significance level of most of the grb afterglow line systems reported in the literature have been put into question ( sako , harrison & rutledge 2004 ) .",
    "this underlines the uncertainties of the previous detections , and the importance of finding , or not finding , such lines with the improved detection sensitivities made possible by earlier spectral measurements when swift comes on line . in this paper , we investigate the detectability of iron line emission , both with swift and with chandra and xmm , and address the question of how far can bursts be detected and their redshifts measured with a quantifiable confidence level ( @xmath38 ) , as function of the epoch after the trigger when the line forms and is observed .",
    "the start time of the grb x - ray afterglow depends on various details about the external density and the parameters of the burst .",
    "here we adopt the usual phenomenological definition which takes the start of the x - ray afterglow @xmath39 to coincide with the end of grb itself ( i.e. of its @xmath40-ray duration ) .    for the x - ray afterglow continuum flux",
    ", we use the observer frame flux @xmath41 as a function of observed energy @xmath42 and observer time @xmath43 for a spectrum parameterized as @xmath44 ( lamb & reichart 2000 ) , generalized to a double power law to account for the jet break and consequent steepening of the light curve .",
    "the source is assumed to have an initial luminosity @xmath45 which in the rest frame is constant between the trigger time and source frame prompt phase duration time @xmath46 , which we take nominally to be 20 s. this is followed by an initial power law decay @xmath47 , and after a time @xmath48 ( the source frame jet break time , nominally taken to be 0.5 days ) , the decay is assumed to follow a steeper power law @xmath49 , due to the jet having a finite size .",
    "the observer - frame spectral flux is then @xmath50~ , \\label{eq : fxdouble}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is the initial grb afterglow isotropic - equivalent luminosity per energy corresponding to an x - ray luminosity in the 0.2 - 10 kev band of @xmath52 erg s@xmath53 , assumed to be constant from trigger time up to the nominal source frame duration @xmath54 s of the gamma - ray emission , and @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "we assume nominal values for the initial temporal decay index @xmath56 , and for the index after the jet break @xmath57 .",
    "for the energy spectral index we adopt a nominal value @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the luminosity distance , using @xmath60",
    ".    models for the time - dependence of the equivalent width ( @xmath27 ) of the x - ray lines involve a number of physical and geometrical assumptions ( ghisellini , lazzati & campana 1999 ; lazzati , campana , & ghisellini 1999 ; weth et al 2000 ; & rees 2000 ; lazzati et al 2002 ; rees & 2000 ; kallman , & rees 2003 ) .",
    "we do not intend here to delve into the details of these models , setting ourselves instead a simpler goal .",
    "that is , assuming that the lines so far detected are real and representative , we ask ourselves up to what redshifts and at what times would such lines be detectable with x - ray instruments available in the next few years ( in particular , taking advantage of swift s fast response time ) . in what follows",
    "we adopt a phenomenological description of the equivalent width of fe group lines in the afterglow , based on the reported detections in five cases of emission lines with equivalent widths @xmath61 kev at observer epochs @xmath62 day after the trigger .",
    "earlier measurements with a large area high resolution instrument do not exist ( although one prompt absorption line lasting of order @xmath63 s was reported with the wide - field detector on bepoo - sax , amati , etal , 2000 ) , and this could be due to slewing time limitations of previous missions .",
    "however , one expects in a distant reprocessor ( e.g. supranova ) model the line to become prominent at 0.5 - 1 day due to the geometry of the model ( lazzati et al 1999 ; weth et al 2000 ) . on the other hand , in nearby reprocessor ( e.g. stellar funnel ) models",
    ", a crude argument indicates that emission lines could start as early as minutes after the trigger ( & rees 2001 ) , and the @xmath27 may remain roughly constant for times of order one day , due to a long - lived decaying jet or ourflow .",
    "ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) calculated in more detail the evolution of @xmath27 with incident luminosity , using the reflection code developed by ross , weaver , & mccray ( 1978 ) and updated by ross & fabian ( 1993 ) . using solar abundances and incidence angles of 45 and 75 degrees , they find for both distant and nearby models a similar @xmath27 tendency of an initial increase as a power law until reaching a plateau maximum , followed by a steeper decay . for the distant model , this can be understood as being due to the ionization parameter @xmath64 being in the range @xmath65 where high - ionization fe lines are prominent ( for solar abundances ) at the time when the effective emitting area dictated by the light travel time to the shell reaches a maximum , and afterwards dropping off .",
    "for the nearby model , the similar behavior in this calculation may be ascribed to the @xmath66 drop in time , @xmath67 initially being too high for fe lines , then after a decrease being for a finite time into the optimum range for high - ionization fe lines , and then dropping below the optimum range .",
    "thus qualitatively this calculation suggests that both models have a rising and decaying @xmath27 , with a peak near one day , compatible with current observations .",
    "there are a number of factors , however , which can lead to significant changes in the simple model discussed above .",
    "for instance , more shallow incidence angles , as might be expected in nearby funnel models , can increase significantly the @xmath27 over what is obtained at wider incidence angles ( kallman , & rees , 2003 ) , and the @xmath27 also increases when the fe abundance is larger than solar .",
    "a supersolar fe abundance also affects the luminosity dependence of the ionization equilibrium ; as shown by lazzati , ramirez - ruiz & rees ( 2002 ) , an fe abundance ten time solar extends to @xmath68 the range where highly ionized fe lines are prominent .",
    "thus , for a typical nearby funnel model with @xmath69 inside a shell @xmath70 at @xmath71 cm and density @xmath72 @xmath73 , an initial luminosity @xmath74 erg / s at source time @xmath75 s decaying @xmath76 leads to a prominent fe line ( for ten times supersolar fe ) for @xmath77 between source times @xmath78 s , corresponding at @xmath79 to observer times @xmath80 . for 100 times supersolar fe",
    ", the fe lines are expected to be prominent starting at even shorter times .",
    "a funnel model can be expected to be metal enriched and to have very shallow incidence angles .",
    "thus , based on the above simple argument , it is plausible to assume that in a funnel model a large @xmath27 , say of order the 0.5 - 1 kev values reported , could be present starting minutes after the trigger and up to days . such approximate estimates , of course , would need more careful testing via numerical calculations , requiring a number of additional assumptions and extensive parameter space modeling .",
    "short of doing that , we can bracket the line @xmath27 behavior of funnel models as ranging between , at one extreme , being similar to that of the distant models ( that is , an @xmath81 kev only near 0.5 - 2 days ) , and at he other extreme , having an almost constant @xmath82 kev from minutes to days .",
    "clearly , a distinction between nearby or distant models will require much further numerical modelling , and/or observations determining whether a dense reprocessor can be present at @xmath83 cm at the time of the burst .",
    "we do can not address such a choice here .",
    "however , noting that the generic behavior of a line producing region is bound to be bracketed between the above mentioned two extremes , we investigate the line detectability in the case of both of these behaviors .",
    "the simplified approach adopted here is to assume a phenomenological x - ray continuum whose time behavior is given by equation ( [ eq : fxdouble ] ) , and assume that the afterglow produces fe group lines whose rest - frame @xmath84 kev is comparable to the reported values , without specifying the physical model giving rise to them . for the line temporal behavior we consider the two cases above .",
    "one case has an ( approximately ) constant @xmath27 between minutes to days , which may be plausible for nearby ( funnel ) models under conditions as discussed above .",
    "the other case treated assumes a variable @xmath27 , which starts small and peaks around one day ( based on the calculations of ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz , 2001 , e.g. their intermediate curve , where @xmath27= 10 ev for @xmath85 erg / s ; then an @xmath27 increasing as a power law for @xmath86 erg / s , up to @xmath82 kev for @xmath87 erg / s ; and an @xmath27 exponential decay for @xmath88 erg / s .",
    "this implies an @xmath27 peak time around @xmath281 - 2 days at redshift @xmath7 in our model .",
    "for these two models , we then calculate the signal to noise ratio of the line observation as a function of redshift and observer time .",
    "the typical procedure which we follow is : ( i ) we create a nominal observed spectrum from the theoretical equation ( [ eq : fxdouble ] ) and an emission line of a given @xmath27 and assumed width ( e.g. due to thermal motions or bulk dispersion velocities ) , and convolve this with the response function of the instrument , using the standard x - ray spectral fitting package _ xspec_. as examples , we have used the response functions of swift xrt , chandra acis and xmm - epic .",
    "the relative effective areas of these instruments are shown in figure [ fig : effarea ] .    in practice ,",
    "the input spectrum is a power - law continuum plus a gaussian @xmath89 iron line , taking into account the absorption by the galactic medium ( wabs*(powerlaw+gaussian ) ) . for this model",
    ", we have to input 6 initial parameters : ( a ) galactic column density , ( b)power - law continuum power - law index , ( c)continuum flux normalization factor , ( d ) gaussian line energy , ( e ) line width , and ( f ) normalization for the gaussian line . the galactic column density was set to a typical value @xmath90 ( n. brandt 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the continuum normalization is determined by the continuum flux given by the formula ( [ eq : fxdouble ] ) , making those two fluxes consistent over the instrument observing band ( e.g. 0.2 - 10 kev ) . because the simulated spectrum is seen in the observer frame , the gaussian line energy is given by the equation @xmath91 .",
    "the line width is taken to be proportional to the line energy .",
    "observationally , there is no consensus on how much the  typical \" line width is .",
    "for the same burst grb 991216 , piro ( 2000 ) obtained a line width of @xmath92 kev , while ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used a narrow line ( @xmath93 kev ) to get a better fit .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume it to be a broad line , because physically the photoionization of fe - rich plasmas for an ionization parameter @xmath94 is expected to result in an equilibrium rest - frame temperature of a few kev . in the simulations ,",
    "we have used a fixed relation between the line energy and the line width , which for the most part is @xmath95 kev ( except where we compared broad vs. narrow lines).the last parameter ( f ) is the equivalent width @xmath27 , which for the constant @xmath27 models is set to be 1 kev , and in the varying @xmath27 case it is given by the time dependence discussed above leading to a value @xmath96 kev at about one day .",
    "\\(ii ) once we have the simulated spectrum , we follow the standard method of analyzing the spectrum using the _ xpsec _ software package and determine to what degree the line is detectable , calculating the significance level ( in standard deviations @xmath35 ) for one specific detection according to the f - test .",
    "\\(iii ) we repeat the steps ( ( i ) and ( ii ) ) for at least 100 times , and check the repeatability of the detection rate of a line at a certain significance level .",
    "in addition , we have also tested the degree to which instruments can differentiate a broad line from a narrow line , or distinguish between lines with different central energies , such as 6.4 and 6.7 kev .",
    "this is of interest as a diagnostic for the dynamics and thermal conditions in the emission region , which would provide a valuable tool in assessing models .",
    "the procedure used for these two tests are similar to those described above .",
    "the simulated spectra are obtained assuming the same input parameters as before .",
    "each simulated spectrum is fitted with a power law and a fixed rest - frame line energy at either 6.4 kev or 6.7 kev , and we check the chi - square difference between the two fits , which indicates how the change of line energy affects the fit result .",
    "we repeated this fit and comparison procedure for each set of parameters 50 times , in order to reduce the statistical errors , and derive from this an average chi - square difference .",
    "based on the chi - square difference , we find the corresponding probability , which is a function of the chi - square difference and the degrees of freedom ( chapter 15.6 , numerical recipes in c++ , press et al .",
    "2002 ) . for example",
    ", a chi - square difference of 21 and 5 degrees of freedom corresponds to a probability 0.999 , which is 3 @xmath35 . for the narrow line versus broad line test , we fixed as examples the line width to be 670 ev ( broad line ) and 200 ev ( narrower line ) , respectively , in the rest frame , and follow a similar procedure as above for the line energy test .",
    "note that in our simulations we have used the chi - square statistics throughout , instead of likelihood statistics , which is valid and guaranteed by the large enough number of photons in each bin ( at least 20 photons ) and in total ( usually thousand of photons collected during the whole integration time ) .",
    "we have done simulations for several sets of grb afterglow model parameters .",
    "the source - frame duration of the grb is taken to be @xmath97 s or @xmath98 s. we show only the plots for @xmath97 s , the longer durations being used only for comparison .",
    "the initial isotropic - equivalent luminosity is usually taken to be @xmath99 , consistent with the present ( @xmath100 few ) observations ( costa 1998 ) . as an alternative",
    ", we also consider a higher than usual initial x - ray luminosity , @xmath101 erg s@xmath53 , which might be typical of high redshift grb , e.g. schneider et al , 2002 ) .",
    "( note that we take an initial x - ray luminosity which is assumed to be about one order of magnitude below the corresponding prompt @xmath40-ray luminosity ) .",
    "the source - frame equivalent width is typically taken as @xmath102 or 0.5 kev ( only the 1 kev results are shown ) .",
    "we consider the two generic line temporal behaviors discussed above , one in which the k@xmath24 line has a a large @xmath103 constant from minutes after the trigger up to days , and another in which the @xmath104 starts low , grows to @xmath84 kev on a timescale @xmath96 day , and drops rapidly afterwards ( see discussion in  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the integration time was taken to be 0.6 times the observing time , counted after the grb trigger ( i.e. for an observer time 1 day we take we take an integration time of 0.6 days ending at 1 day .",
    "we took a grid of values in redshift @xmath105 and observer time @xmath43 , and with the above parameters and the procedure outlined in the previous section we calculate for each pair of @xmath106 values the significance level of the detection with various instruments . for most of the calculations ( unless stated otherwise ) this procedure is repeated 300 times for each point , and the average chi - squared value is adopted , resulting in contour plots of the standard deviation @xmath35 in the @xmath106 plane .",
    "e.g. , regions in the plot with significance levels @xmath1 indicate that the detection is likely to be real .",
    "fig [ fig : swchxm_50_1.0 ] shows the line detection significance levels attainable with swift , chandra and xmm for a burst of initial x - ray luminosity @xmath107 , source - frame equivalent width @xmath102 kev ( assumed constant ) , for a source - frame grb prompt duration @xmath97 s. this shows that swift can detect such iron lines with significance @xmath3 up to @xmath108 for observer times @xmath109 s , or up to @xmath110 for observer times @xmath2 s. to @xmath111 for observer times up to a day .",
    "the bends in the significance level plots , e.g. at intermediate redshifts and times for swift , are due to the minima in the effective area of the instrument at intermediate energies ( figure [ fig : effarea ] ) .",
    "this is superposed on the expected overall tendency of a decreasing significance level with increasing time and redshift . for",
    "longer burst durations , e.g. @xmath112=40 s , the continuum flux level is correspondingly higher at the same time , and the lines are detectable to correspondingly higher redshifts or times . for a decreased equivalent width ,",

    "the significance levels become lower as the observing time increases , as expected from the dimming , hence an earlier acquisition of the target as well as an early turn - on of the line improve the chances of detection .",

    "roughly , one can say that bursts with the standard parameters used here would be detectable at better than @xmath115 confidence level with chandra up to @xmath116 , and with xmm up to @xmath117 , at observer times @xmath118 s = 1 day . for later observer times , similar significance may be obtained for lower redshifts .",

    "the results for swift are shown in the left panel of fig [ fig : merge_all_sw_50_1.0 ] , while the results for chandra are shown in the left panel of fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] and those for xmm are shown in the left panel of fig [ fig : merge_all_xmm_50_1.0 ] , for the standard luminosity burst case .    for lines of different central energies , such as he - like fe 6.7 kev k@xmath24 and the lower ionization state fe 6.4 kev line ,",
    "the line energy difference is 0.3/(1+z ) kev , and naively one expects a sensitivity to detecting different lines up to a redshift @xmath12",
    ". the same factors , such as @xmath27 , integration time , etc , will affect the detectability . using the statistical method described above , we have plotted for swift in fig [ fig : merge_all_sw_50_1.0 ] , for chandra in fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] , and for xmm - newton in fig [ fig : merge_all_xmm_50_1.0 ] the significance contours for differentiating a 6.4 vs. a 6.7 kev line ( middle panels ) .",
    "we have also investigated the ability to distinguish between the he - like fe 6.7 kev and the corresponding co 7.2 kev or ni 7.8 kev lines ( which are all he - like ) .",
    "we find that it is easier to distinguish co or ni he - like lines from the fe 6.7 kev line than it is to distinguish between the fe 6.7 and 6.4 kev lines , because the line energy differences are larger than that between fe 6.4 and 6.7 kev lines .",
    "the significance contours for differentiating an fe 6.7 kev from a co 7.2 kev line are shown for swift in fig [ fig : merge_all_sw_50_1.0 ] , for chandra in fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] , and for xmm - newton in fig [ fig : merge_all_xmm_50_1.0 ] ( right panels , in all three ) , for a standard burst of initial x - ray luminosity @xmath142 erg / s , @xmath102 kev , @xmath97 s. for bursts of higher initial luminosity @xmath101 erg / s , swift s ability to discriminate between fe 6.7 kev and co 7.2 kev lines is shown in the right panel of fig [ fig : merge_all_sw_51_1.0 ] .",
    "we note that if lines of different widths or different energies are determined to be distinguishable with the above procedure , this implies that the lines are detectable at the 3 @xmath35 or higher level .",
    "this is because in _ xspec _ , if a line is not detectable or is detectable at a smaller significance level , the possible parameter range does not make a significant difference in the fitting results . the converse , however , is not true , since there may be cases where a line is detectable at the 3 @xmath35 level , while differences in the line energies or line widths can not be distinguished at a comparable level of significance .",
    "we have quantitatively investigated the prospects for the detection of fe group x - ray emission lines in gamma - ray burst afterglows , for various redshifts extending up to @xmath143 and observing times extending up to 10 days after the trigger .",
    "we have used as a template for the x - ray continuum the spectral and temporal behavior inferred from afterglow observations , and have assumed fe line rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath84 kev comparable to those reported in a number of grb afterglows .",
    "these line and continuum models are purely phenomenological , without explicit reference to particular models .",
    "it is not known at present whether lines , if present , are formed soon after the outburst or only after periods of a day or so , as suggested by existing observations , since slewing time constraints in previous experiments prevented verification of the time of onset of the lines .",
    "thus , we have tested for the line detectability at observer times starting at @xmath144 s and up to days .",
    "we have assumed two simplified models for the equivalent width time behavior , motivated by generic analytical and numerical photoionization models .",
    "one of these assumes an equivalent width which does not change significantly with time , being a constant fraction of the photoionizing continuum .",
    "this model may be pertinent to so - called nearby models of line formation in the jet funnel or outer parts of the expanding star .",
    "the other assumes an equivalent width which grows in time up to a maximum value reached at about one day , and subsequently declines .",
    "this is motivated by so - called distant , or geometric models , e.g. where a shell of dense material is encountered at about a light day from the source .",
    "a similar behavior , however , may occur for some values of the parameters also in nearby models .",
    "the results for simulated observations with the x - ray detectors in swift ( xrt ) , chandra ( acis s3 ) and xmm ( epic ) are presented as contour plots of the significance level of line detection , expressed in standard deviations , for a gaussian line of constant or varying equivalent width superposed on a power law continuum declining in time , as a function of redshift and observing time . as expected , the line detectability is sensitively dependent on the initial and subsequent continuum x - ray luminosity and on the equivalent width . due to the k - correction effects whereby the spectral and temporal redshift - dependent changes partially cancel out , the sensitivity decrease in a given energy band with increasing redshift is more moderate than one would naively expect from the bolometric decay .",
    "notice that this is dependent on the afterglow spectral and temporal indices entering in @xmath145 . for the nominal values adopted here , @xmath146 , @xmath147 ( before the break ) ,",
    "the k - correction is @xmath148 , but the specific values can differ substantially between bursts .    for an initial x - ray isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath149 erg / s , a constant source - frame equivalent width @xmath102 kev and a prompt - phase source - frame duration @xmath97 s , swift , chandra , and xmm can detect lines with significance @xmath3 roughly out to @xmath150 respectively ( fig [ fig : swchxm_50_1.0 ] ) , for times of order @xmath151 s. for a similar initial luminosity but an equivalent width @xmath121 kev , the corresponding redshifts drop substantially ; e.g. swift and chandra could detect lines to @xmath152 , respectively , with the same confidence level as above for times of @xmath153 s.    in a more detailed model , the equivalent width could vary in time , and in this case one would expect the line detectability to be maximal when the equivalent width reaches its peak value ( see  [ sec : model ] for detailed model ) . outside the peak range , the @xmath27 is smaller and the detectablity drops rapidly .",
    "our calculations for a standard luminosity burst of @xmath149 erg / s indicate that swift could detect fe lines up to @xmath154 for times @xmath155 seconds ( fig [ fig : ew_vary ] , left ) . for the same parameters ,",
    "chandra could detect fe lines out to @xmath156 for times of @xmath157 seconds ( fig [ fig : ew_vary ] , right ) . for more luminous afterglows of @xmath101 erg / s ( which may be characteristic of pop .",
    "iii bursts ) , fe lines could be detected with swift out to @xmath158 with the same confidence level and observer time range as chandra does for the standard ( lower ) luminosity case .",
    "an interesting question is how far and how late can various instruments distinguish between lines of the same energy centroid but different widths , or between lines of similar widths but different energy centroids .",
    "the former is more difficult , especially at high redshifts or late times when the detection is marginal , and for this we investigated the distinguishability of nominal `` broad '' lines with @xmath159 0.1 vs. `` narrow '' lines with @xmath159 0.03 , i.e. 0.6 kev vs. 0.2 kev widths for the fe 6.7 kev lines . for investigating the sensibility to different line centroids",
    ", we assumed the same widths @xmath160 kev for lines of centroid energies 6.7 kev vs. 6.4 kev ( he - like fe vs. the lower ionization fe line complex ) , as well as 6.7 kev ( he - like fe ) vs. 7.2 kev ( he - like co ) . for a standard luminosity afterglow of @xmath149 erg / s and a constant equivalent width @xmath102 kev , @xmath97 s , the figures ( [ fig : merge_all_sw_50_1.0 ] ) , ( [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] ) and ( [ fig : merge_all_xmm_50_1.0 ] ) show the ability to distinguish these different line cases with swift , chandra and xmm - newton , respectively .",
    "one sees that for such standard luminosity bursts , swift can differentiate an 0.67 kev line width from an 0.2 kev width out to @xmath161 with confidence level of @xmath162 for times @xmath163 s. it it can distinguish a 6.7 kev line from a 6.4 kev line out to @xmath164 with confidence level @xmath165 at times @xmath6 seconds ; and a 6.7 kev line from a 7.2 kev line out to @xmath166 with @xmath162 for times @xmath6 s. as might be expected , a 7.2 kev line is easier to distinguish from a 6.7 kev than the latter is from a 6.4 kev line , since the energy difference is larger . because chandra and xmm have much larger effective areas , one expects that they can make such distinctions out to larger redshifts and longer times , as is verified from an inspection of fig [ fig : swchxm_50_1.0 ] ( middle and right panels ) .",
    "e.g. with chandra , and @xmath149 erg / s , @xmath102 kev , the same line width differences can be distinguished out to roughly @xmath167 and @xmath168 s with a confidence level @xmath165 ( fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] , left ) , and energy differences of 6.4 vs. 6.7 kev out to @xmath7 and @xmath169 s ( fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] , middle ) ; while energy difference of 6.7 vs. 7.2 kev can be distinguished out to @xmath170 and @xmath169 s with @xmath165 ( fig [ fig : merge_all_ch_50_1.0 ] , right ) .",
    "for xmm , the corresponding redshifts are of order is @xmath171 with a confidence level of @xmath162 for times of order @xmath172 s ( fig [ fig : merge_all_xmm_50_1.0 ] ) .    for larger initial isotropic - equivalent x - ray luminosities , e.g. @xmath101",
    "erg / s corresponding to an extreme low - resdhift case or a nominal high - redshift pop .",
    "iii case , swift ( and of course chandra and xmm ) can detect lines out to much higher redshifts compared to the standard case of @xmath149 erg / s .",
    "this is shown in fig [ fig : merge_all_sw_51_1.0 ] , where for a constant @xmath102 kev and @xmath97 s the maximum @xmath115 redshifts at @xmath173 s are @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 for the detection of a 6.7 kev line , for distinguishing two line widths of 0.67 vs. 0.2 kev , and for distinguishing two lines of 6.7 vs. 7.2 kev ( left , middle and right panels , respectively ) .    in conclusion",
    ", if x - ray lines are present in grb , chandra and xmm , with their slower slew response times , should be able to detect them at observer times @xmath177 days ( @xmath178 days in the source frame ) out to very high redshifts @xmath179 , in the range where the universe started to reionize , for burst properties similar to those inferred in @xmath180 objects . if xmm and chandra do not detect new lines at a higher significance level than previously reported ( noting that line evidence is considered currently for 9 out of 21 bursts , e.g. sako et al .",
    "2004 ) , one might conclude that the conditions assumed here do not apply to some or all of the bursts ; or the @xmath27 are smaller ( e.g. as in the variable @xmath27 case , see fig [ fig : ew_vary ] ) ; or the luminosity is smaller ; or the lines do not appear early on , when the flux is high , etc . if on the other hand lines are detected , xmm and chandra should also be able to distinguish details such as line widths or central energies out to redshifts where the first galaxies formed , @xmath141 .",
    "swift , with its fast slew time , should be able to detect lines at much earlier times , if present , starting at @xmath181 s , and out to redshifts @xmath167 , or to higher redshifst for the more luminous bursts . in the latter case , it would also be able to answer questions about line broadening , ionization stage or line physics out to @xmath182 and times up to a day .",
    "thus swift , in conjunction with larger spacecraft such as chandra and xmm , should be able to answer important questions about burst properties as a function of the age of the universe , such as whether x - ray lines occur in them , at what times in the source frame they form , and out to what redshifts , as well as details of the physical conditions in the burst .    this research has been supported through nasa nag5 - 13286 and the monell foundation .",
