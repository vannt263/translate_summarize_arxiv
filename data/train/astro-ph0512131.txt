    "twilight and dawn flats were acquired every evening and used for flat fielding .",
    "four standard star fields from @xcite  pg1633 , pg2213 , and two fields in l95  were observed throughout the potentially photometric nights .",
    "these fields consisted of a total of 22 stars with a color range of @xmath8 and were observed at airmasses ranging from 1.1 to 1.8 to ensure accurate determination of the photometric extinction and color terms .",
    "aperture photometry was completed on the standard star frames using the apphot package within iraf .",

    "the difference between the magnitudes given by the psf and aperture photometry constituted the aperture correction , which was then applied to the original psf photometry .",
    "typical values for the aperture correction ranged between 0.1 and 0.2 , and the values showed no trends in variation across the chip .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the clusters were constructed using the standard magnitudes given by the transformation equations ( see section [ transf ] ) .",

    "a helium - burning clump can not be accurately identified .",
    "a binary sequence located 0.75 magnitudes above the main sequence is detected , most notably in the @xmath28 cmd .",
    "our photometry covers a much smaller area , and is not quite as deep as the photometry presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our photometry of ngc 188 was obtained so that a precise , relative comparison could be made be the well studied cluster ngc 188 and be 17 .",
    "in addition , the ngc 188 can be used to assess the absolute calibration of our photometry , via a comparison to other data sets .",
    "this paper s ngc 188 photometry was compared to that of @xcite on a star by star basis .",

    "it is not clear whose data is best calibrated onto the standard system .",
    "based upon these comparisons it appears that our photometry is on the @xcite photometric system to an accuracy of @xmath37mag .    as a result of berkeley 17 s large distance and low galactic latitude ,",
    "its cmd is highly contaminated by field stars .",
    "the cmd consists of a total of 1239 stars , and extends approximately 4 magnitudes fainter than the main - sequence turnoff , located at @xmath38 .",
    "a highly contaminated main - sequence can be discerned , along with a well - populated subgiant branch and a scarcely populated giant branch . neither a helium - burning clump not a binary sequence can be discerned .",
    "the @xmath39 colour - colour diagram can be used to estimate reddening , and thereby remove many foreground stars ( which typically have a lower reddening ) from the cmd of berkeley 17 .",
    "the colour - colour of ngc 188 ( which has a low reddening , and few foreground stars ) was compared with the be 17 colour - colour diagram to partially eliminate field star contamination ( figure [ n188be17color ] ) .",
    "the cleaned berkeley 17 cmd contains 1083 stars , and is shown in figure [ cleanbe17cmd ] .",
    "stars which are deemed to be non - members of be17 are denoted by a zero in the final column of table [ be17phottable ] .",
    "a comparison between this paper s @xmath40 photometry ( before field star removal ) and that of @xcite is shown in figure [ be17comp ] . while the phelps photometry ( which surveyed a somewhat smaller region ) reaches approximately a magnitude deeper , this paper s photometry displays both a tighter main - sequence and a more well - defined main - sequence turnoff .",
    "the phelps photometry is redder than our photometry , with @xmath41mag .",
    "given the good agreement of our ngc 188 photometry with the photometry from @xcite we believe that our photometry is on the standard @xcite system to within @xmath37mag .",

    "the models were evolved in 2000 time steps from the zero age main - sequence through the red giant branch .",
    "the models include the diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",
    "a solar calibrated model was calculated , yielding @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( initial abundances ) . for other metallicities ,",
    "@xmath45 was assumed ( corresponding to a primordial helium abundance of @xmath46 ) .",
    "the solar calibrated mixing length was used for all the models .",
    "the isochrones were created for metallicities of [ fe / h ] = + 0.20 , + 0.10 , + 0.00 , 0.12 , 0.30 , 0.40 , 0.60 , 0.70 , 0.82 , and 1.00 .    the transformation from the theoretical log(l ) versus log(t@xmath47 )",
    "plane to observed colors and magnitudes for the constructed isochrones was completed using two separate color transformations , as this represents one of the greatest uncertainties of the theoretical isochrones .",
    "the first transformation utilized the @xcite model atmospheres as described in @xcite , and the second , the @xcite color tables .",
    "the isochrones were constructed in the age range of 100 myr to 15 gyr for each of the aforementioned metallicities and color transformations , thereby allowing for considerable flexibility in performing the isochrone fits to the cluster cmds .",
    "one of the most important isochrone input parameters is metallicity , and therefore , accurate cluster metallicities are crucial to obtaining reliable age estimates .",
    "we are interested in obtaining precise relative ages for ngc 188 and be 17 .",
    "for this reason , we elected to use the metallicity estimates from @xcite , who conducted an extensive , homogeneous spectroscopic survey of a large number of old open clusters , seeking to accurately determine both cluster metallicities and reddenings .",
    "this paper s clusters , ngc 188 and berkeley 17 , were both included in their investigation . as the @xcite metallicities for these two clusters were done in a homogeneous manner , it is likely that the metallicity difference between the two clusters was robustly measured",
    ".    for relative age determinations , using precise relative metallicity determinations is more important than the zero - point of the metallicity scale . in this",
    "regard , high - resolution spectroscopy of m67 @xcite found [ fe / h ] values which are about 0.1 dex higher than @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xcite study may be underestimating the metallicity of the clusters .",
    "this implies that our absolute age determinations could be systematically in error , but does not effect our relative age determinations . a 0.1 dex increase in [ fe / h ]",
    "would systematically decrease our age estimates by approximately 8% .",
    "@xcite used fe i and fe - peak blends to measure metallicities and the h@xmath48 strength of main sequence stars spanning the distance to the cluster were used to determine reddening values .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath49 = -0.10\\pm 0.09 $ ] and @xmath50 for ngc 188 .",
    "however , @xcite note that their h@xmath48 reddening value is lower than published estimates and adopt @xmath51 . for be 17",
    ", @xcite found @xmath49 = -0.33\\pm 0.12 $ ] and @xmath52 .",
    "in fitting the isochrones to the cmds of the two clusters , fits are made to the upper main - sequence , main - sequence turnoff and sub - giant regions .",
    "the colour of the red giant branch was not used in the fitting process , as it s location in the theoretical models depends sensitively on super - adiabatic convection which is not well understood .",
    "similarly , the colour of the lower main sequence was not used in the fit , as there are difficulties with the conversion between theoretical temperatures and colours for cool main sequence stars .",
    "the range of acceptable isochrone fits is constrained by the requirement of simultaneous fits in the @xmath40 and @xmath28 cmds .",
    "the metallicity , reddening , and distance modulus are required to be identical in both cmds , assuming @xmath53 $ ] @xcite .",
    "metallicities and reddenings are required to be consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "isochrone fit parameters are summarized in table [ table5 ] .        as a result of the high quality of the photometry , and its distinct cmd morphology ngc 188",
    "is determined to be @xmath2gyr old .",
    "the results obtained using the two individual sets of color transformations are consistent , and an excellent agreement with the spectroscopic values from @xcite is also evident .",
    "a sample isochrone fit is shown in figure [ n188isofit ] .",
    "an age of @xmath54gyr agrees well with the previous age determination of @xmath54gyr , by @xcite ; @xmath5gyr by @xcite and @xmath55gyr by @xcite .",
    "these studies utilized different photometry and stellar evolution models .",
    "the agreement between the different studies suggest that the age of ngc 188 has been robustly determined .      the age of berkeley 17 is found to be 10.0 @xmath3 1.0 gyr . as a result of the larger reddening uncertainty , greater field star contamination , and the less distinct cluster cmd morphology ,",
    "the established age for berkeley 17 has a greater uncertainty than does ngc 188 .",
    "however , by using the constraints on reddening and metallicity from spectroscopy and requiring simultaneous fitting in @xmath40 and @xmath56 , reliable results are obtained .",
    "similar ages are obtained using the two separate color transformations .",
    "a sample isochrone fit is shown in figure [ be17isofit ] .",
    "our age for be 17 is on the low side of the estimates made by @xcite , who determined an age of 12.5 gyr based on the @xcite isochrones , and 10.013.0 gyr based on the @xcite isochrones .",
    "however , as no accurate spectroscopic study had been performed for berkeley 17 at the time , @xcite allowed for a large range of metallicities and reddenings .",
    "additionally , simultaneous fitting in the @xmath40 , @xmath28 cmds was not an important factor in phelps isochrone fitting process , mainly because the isochrones were not normalized to the sun either in terms of helium abundance or in terms of the mixing - length parameter .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found an lower estimate of @xmath57 gyr using the @xcite isochrones on both the @xcite and @xcite photometry .",
    "@xcite , using the same methodology as @xcite made age determinations of previously well - studied clusters ngc 188 and ngc 6791 , for which age estimates of 6.5 @xmath3 0.5 gyr ( ngc 188 ) and 8.5 @xmath3 0.5 gyr ( ngc 6791 ) were determined .",
    "the @xcite results imply an age difference between ngc 188 and berkeley 17 of approximately 2.5 gyr , consistent with the results obtained in this paper .",
    "the fact that our age estimates for be 17 agree with @xcite and @xcite is surprising , given that our photometry has a significant offset from the @xcite photometry ( see figure [ be17comp ] ) .",
    "in order to study the early formation history of the milky way , it is useful to compare the derived ages of ngc 188 and be17 to other old open clusters and globular clusters . as accurate estimates of the metallicity of a cluster are critical for age determinations , open clusters were selected from the @xcite metallicity study which included [ fe / h ] measurements for 39 clusters . from this list , clusters were selected which had good quality photometry and a morphological age index @xcite greater than 2.0 ( corresponding to an age of approximately 1 gyr ) .",
    "the final sample of open clusters contains 18 clusters .",
    "globular clusters were selected from the extensive , homogeneous hst photometric study of globular clusters carried out by @xcite .",
    "we elected to restrict our sample to relatively metal - rich ( @xmath49 > -1.2 $ ] ) clusters located in the inner part of the galaxy ( @xmath58kpc ) . requiring the globular clusters to be relatively metal - rich makes the age comparisons to the more metal - rich open clusters more direct .",
    "the restriction on galacto - center distance was made in an attempt to only include clusters which were formed as part of the initial galactic collapse , and not as part of a latter accretion event .",
    "@xcite found that globular clusters within a galactocentric radius of 8 kpc are nearly coeval , implying that the inner halo globular clusters formed in the initial galactic collapse , whereas the outer halo  where clusters were found to have a larger range in age  was likely formed through the accretion of extra - galactic fragments .",
    "finally , the globular classification provided in the recent study by @xcite was used to exclude clusters belonging to the young halo ( yh ) , as these are believed to have been formed in external satellites eventually accreted by the milky way .",
    "our globular cluster sample contains 13 clusters with b , v photometry from @xcite . for three of these clusters",
    " 47 tuc , ngc 5927 , and ngc 6652  hst vi photometry was also available .    given the sensitivity of isochrone fitting to the assumed metallicity , it is important that a consistent metallicity scale be used for the open and globular clusters .",
    "while numerous studies have attempted to determine uniform globular cluster @xcite and open cluster @xcite metallicities , these studies have generally not overlapped between the two cluster populations .",
    "@xcite used equivalent width observations to establish a linear relationship between ca ii triplet equivalent widths and the globular cluster abundance scale of @xcite .",
    "this lead to a relative metallicity abundance ranking for a total of 71 globular clusters . @xcite sought to extend the ca ii triplet abundance scale to the younger ages and higher metallicities of open clusters .",
    "new spectra were obtained for a sample of five globular clusters and six old open clusters , and using globular cluster abundances on the @xcite scale and open cluster abundances on the @xcite scale , a linear relationship between [ fe / h ] and ca ii line strength was found .",
    "a crucial point in their study was to establish the compatibility of the two metallicity scales , given that the calibration of two scales differs in two respects : the atmosphere models utilized , and the effective temperature derivations .",
    "@xcite conclude that the systematic offsets between the two scales are comparable to or smaller than their respective internal uncertainties .",
    "they believe that the offset resulting from the choice of model atmospheres is of similar magnitude but opposite sign of that of the choice of effective temperature scale .",
    "@xcite conclude that the offset between the two metallicity scales is no more than 0.1 dex .",
    "globular and open cluster metallicities were thus taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "individual ages for all of the clusters were determined using main sequence fitting , in the same manner that was done for ngc 188 and pal 11 . in making these fits ,",
    "the metallicity of the isochrone was required to be consistent to within 0.1 dex of the cluster metallicity .",
    "the isochrones were constructed using scaled solar compositions , while globular clusters are typically enhanced in their @xmath59-element ( o , mg , si , s , and ca ) abundances . to take this into account , the relationship between the heavy elements mass fraction ( @xmath60 ) in the isochrones and [ fe / h ] followed the relationship given by @xcite and @xcite . in making this correction , globular cluster @xmath61",

    "this is the same age reduction estimated for the open clusters , based upon the suggestion that the @xcite metallicity values are too low by 0.1 dex .",
    "the globular clusters have ages in the range 11.8  14.0 gyr , with no evidence for an age range .",
    "the thick disk globular clusters ( the most metal - rich clusters in our sample ) were found to have an average age of @xmath78gyr , while the two oldest open clusters in our sample have an age of @xmath79gyr .",
    "thus , the oldest open clusters in the thin disk are found to be @xmath80gyr younger than the thick disk globular clusters .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find no significant age difference between the thin and thick disks in the galaxy .",
    "however , their age determinations generally had larger error bars than our determinations , and @xcite determined the age of two thick disk globular clusters , while we determine the age of three thick disk globular clusters .",
    "combined , these two effects made it difficult for @xcite to determine if age differences less than 3 gyr existed . in summary , we find that the oldest open clusters imply that the thin disk started forming @xmath80gyr after the formation of the thick disk .",
