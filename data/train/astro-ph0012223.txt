    "the hot plasma in the corona of the sun and of other stars is thought to be in `` coronal equilibrium '' .",
    "atomic excitations occur through collisions with electrons . the excited atoms decay radiatively and the emitted radiation escapes without any further interaction with the emitting plasma . as a consequence ,",
    "the emission is optically thin , and the total flux emitted in some spectral band or in a given emission line is proportional to the emission measure @xmath15 , defined as the integral of the square of the plasma density @xmath16 over the emitting volume elements d@xmath17 through @xmath18 .",
    "thus , observationally , the contributions of density and volume to a given observed value of @xmath15 can not be disentangled .",
    "stellar x - ray surveys carried out with the _ einstein _ and rosat satellites have shown an enormous range of x - ray luminosity ( @xmath19 ) for stars of given spectral type ( cf . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "typically , one observes star to star variations in @xmath19 of up to four orders of magnitude , with the largest x - ray luminosities found among the stars with the largest rotation rates .",
    "while one definitely finds a correlation between mean coronal temperature and x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is also clear that the single - most important factor contributing to the large variations in @xmath19 is the variation in emission measure .",
    "the conclusion therefore is that active stars ( can ) have a couple of orders of magnitude higher coronal emission measure , while maintaining the same optical output as low - activity stars like our sun .    the emission measure is directly linked to the structure of stellar coronae , if we assume , going along with the solar analogy , that the x - ray emitting plasma of a stellar corona is confined in magnetic loops .",
    "the observed values of @xmath15 and @xmath19 for a given star could be accounted for either by the existence of more loops than typically visible on the solar surface , by higher density loops or by longer , more voluminous loops .",
    "thus the question is reduced to the following : if @xmath20 for an active star , one wants to know whether this is due to @xmath21 or @xmath22 or both .",
    "spatially resolved solar observations allow to disentangle density and volume contributions to the overall emission measure .",
    "one finds the total x - ray output of the sun dominated  at least under maximum conditions  by the emission from rather small , dense loops .",
    "stellar coronae always appear as point sources .",
    "the only way to infer structural information in these unresolved point sources has been via eclipse studies in suitably chosen systems where one tries to constrain the emitting plasma volume from the observed light curve . another method to infer structure in spatially unresolved data are spectroscopic measurements of density .",
    "the emissivity of plasma in coronal equilibrium in carefully selected lines does depend on density .",
    "some lines may be present in low - density plasmas and disappear in high - density plasmas such as the forbidden lines in he - like triplets , while other lines may appear in high - density plasmas and be absent in low - density plasmas ( such as lines formed following excitations from excited levels ) . with the high - resolution spectroscopic facilities onboard _ chandra",
    "_ it is possible to carry out such studies for a wide range of x - ray sources .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present and discuss some key density diagnostics available in the high - resolution grating spectra obtained with _ chandra_. we will specifically discuss the spectra obtained with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) for the stars capella and procyon .",
    "+    .[star_prop]properties of procyon and capella : mass @xmath23 , radius @xmath24 , effective temperature @xmath25 , log  g and the limb darkening coefficient @xmath26 [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in all of the above analysis we assumed all triplet lines to be optically thin . in the following section we show this assumption to be consistent with our results .",
    "let us therefore assume that the optical depth in the resonance lines is not small .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the measured resonance line flux due to radiative scattering . at line center",
    "the optical depth is given by the equation @xmath27 ( @xcite ) with the fractional ionization is denoted by @xmath28 , the elemental abundances by @xmath29 , the ratio of hydrogen to electron density is @xmath30 , the oscillator strength @xmath31 for all ions , the atomic number is @xmath23 , the wavelength is measured in  , the temperature in k , the electron density @xmath32 in @xmath33 and the mean free path is denoted by @xmath34 . in eq .",
    "[ tau ] we adopt a value of unity for the fractional ionization and use the solar abundances .",
    "we further assume @xmath35 at the peak line formation and note , that @xmath36 is rather insensitive to the precise value of @xmath35 .",
    "we can determine  for each resonance line  that value of @xmath37 which yields an optical depth of unity .",
    "adopting a maximum value of @xmath32 of @xmath38 @xmath33 ( cf . tab .",
    "[ dens_tab ] ) , we determine lower values of @xmath34 of @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 cm and @xmath41 cm , for ovii , nvi and cv , respectively . assuming a geometry most suitable for resonance scattering , we can compute the respective emission measures of @xmath42 respectively . comparing these emission measures with those derived from the measured line",
    "fluxes @xmath43 @xmath44 with the line cooling function @xmath45 and the distance @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "tab.[star_prop ] ) , shows the former to be larger by a few orders of magnitude for both stars .",
    "this inconsistency shows that the assumption of a non - negligible optical depth is invalid and we conclude that optical depth effects are irrelevant for the analysis of he - like triplets in procyon and capella .",
    "both capella and procyon are considered to be solar - like stars . in the solar context",
    "the he - like triplets of oxygen , nitrogen and carbon have been known for a long time and in fact the he - like ion density diagnostics have been first developed to interpret these solar data .",
    "many solar observations are available for the ovii triplet , while only very few observations have been made for the nvi and cv triplets .",
    "the first observations of the cv triplet are reported by @xcite , who obtained an f / i - ratio of 1.9 , while @xcite found an f / i - ratio of 1.0 .",
    "the latter authors also observed the nvi triplet , but failed to detect the intercombination line and hence deduced f / i @xmath47 1.9 .",
    "@xcite observed the cv and nvi triplets during a flare and found a mean value of f / i @xmath48 2 with large scatter between 0.14 around this mean for nvi and a value of 0.21 ( with a scatter between 0.170.25 ) for cv . in consequence ,",
    "little can be said about the solar nvi line ratios because of the large measurement errors .",
    "the measured ratios for both capella and procyon are certainly consistent with the range of nvi f / i values quoted by @xcite . as far as cv is concerned",
    ", the flare data yield very low f / i ratios indicative of high densities .",
    "the cv f / i ratio observed for capella is higher , and that for procyon  still higher than that observed for the @xcite flare  we argue is due to large photospheric radiation fluxes .",
    "we therefore conclude that the layers contributing the cv emission in capella and procyon are at lower density than those encountered in solar flares , and the same applies to the layers emitting nvi .",
    "observations of the ovii triplet in the solar corona are reported by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , all of which refer to the quiescent corona , while some of the observations from @xcite and @xcite refer to flares and those of @xcite refer to active regions .",
    "in addition we considered some data points collected from various sources cited by @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ g_r ] we plot g vs. r of these solar observations and compare these solar data with our _ chandra _ measurements for procyon and capella . for clarity we omitted individual error bars , which are typically 0.10.3 for the solar measurements .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ g_r ] , most of the solar measurements yield r value between 3 and 4 . a few values are significantly lower around r @xmath48 2 , with all them referring to flares or active regions",
    ". our _ chandra _ measurements ( 3.28 for procyon , 4.0 for capella ) thus fall into the bulk part of the solar data .",
    "unfortunately , the solar data are by no means unambiguous .",
    "it is not always clear which regions the data refer to ( except for the flare observations by @xcite ) , and further , most of the observations are relatively old and have not been taken with high spatial resolution ; they are comparable in some sense to our full disk observations of stellar x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , the instrumentation used in different experiments is quite different and each experiment is affected by its own specific difficulties .",
    "nevertheless it seems fair to state that most ovii measurements referring to quiescent conditions are close to the low density limit , thus indicating that the physical properties of the ovii emitting layers in capella and procyon should not be that different from those in the sun ; a little puzzling in this context is the large scatter of the solar g data .",
    "in contrast , the solar flare data ( r @xmath49 2 ) is much lower than any of the other measurements , consistent with a high density plasma .",
    "+ @xcite : quiescent ( diamond ) , flare ( asterix ) , + @xcite ( dotted diamond ) , + @xcite ( filled triangle upside down ) , + @xcite : active region ( plus symbol ) , + @xcite : flare ( cross ) .",
    "+ encircled are our measurements of procyon ( open triangle ) and capella ( open box ) .      inspection of tab .",
    "[ dens_tab ] suggests that @xmath50 for the densities derived from cv , nvi , and ovii ; there is definitely no evidence for @xmath51 .",
    "these findings are in contradiction to the claims made by @xcite , who argue on the basis of fexxi line ratios measured with the euve satellite that @xmath52 @xmath33 .",
    "a recent analysis of the long wavelength part ( @xmath53   ) of the letgs spectrum of capella by @xcite , however , yielded plasma densities of @xmath54 @xmath33 at most for the plasma emitting in the fexxi lines with no evidence for any deviations from the low density limit .",
    "of course , these values refer to those plasma layers emitting in the fexxi line , which ought to be at far higher temperature ( @xmath48 8 mk ) than those emitting in the cv , nvi , and ovii lines ( 12 mk ) .",
    "if we assume all the observed emissions to come from the same magnetically confined structures ( loops ) , one expects the gas pressure to be more or less constant and hence the density at lower temperatures even higher .",
    "however , plasma densities ( for capella ) of @xmath55 @xmath33 at temperatures of 2 mk are clearly inconsistent with our letgs spectra .",
    "therefore the plasma emitting in the fexxi line is either at the low density limit or the fexxi emission comes from different structures than the emissions from he - like ions .",
    "our temperature measurements of the line forming regions ( cf . , tab .",
    "[ ftemp ] ) are not fully conclusive , although they suggest that the same lines of cv , nvi , and ovii respectively are formed at a somewhat higher temperature ( at most a factor of 2 ) in capella as compared to procyon . as a consequence we must have @xmath56 for the gas pressures in the respective line forming regions .",
    "capella s peak coronal temperature is clearly much higher than procyon s . if we again assume  going along with the solar analogy  that for both procyon and capella ( all of ) the x - ray emission originates from magnetically confined plasma loops , the loop top temperatures in capella must be higher than in procyon .",
    "the loop scaling laws then imply for the typical loop length scales @xmath57 for procyon and capella @xmath58 . a conservative estimate yields @xmath59 , thus @xmath14 .",
    "the conclusion then appears inescapable that the typical sizes of the magnetic structures in procyon and capella are quite different by probably at least one order of magnitude .",
    "next , it is instructive to compare the total mean surface fluxes emitted in the helium- and hydrogen - like ions of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen for procyon and capella . using the measured count ratios and correcting for the effects of distance , exposure times and the surface areas of the stars we find for the cv , cvi , nvi , nvii , ovii , and oviii lines values of ( capella)/(procyon ) of 0.96 , 1.37 , 1.09 , 4.9 , 1.87 , and 9.71 respectively .",
    "therefore up to those temperatures where the cv , cvi , and nvi lines are formed , the mean surface fluxes in the two stars hardly differ at all ; pressures and temperatures are also quite similar .",
    "we therefore conclude that the physical characteristics and global properties ( such as filling factor ) of procyon s and capella s corona at a level of @xmath60 k are very similar .",
    "it is interesting to again perform a comparison to the sun .",
    "@xcite quote  for their sl801 rocket flight on nov 20 1969  resonance line fluxes of 4.2 10@xmath61 , 2.1 10@xmath61 , and 3.1 10@xmath61 erg/(@xmath62sec ) for ovii , nvi , and cv respectively .",
    "correcting for the distance between earth and sun we find average surface fluxes of 200 , 100 , and 150 erg/@xmath62/sec for ovii , nvi , and cv respectively on the solar surface .",
    "carrying out the same calculation for our _ chandra _ data , we find  using the effective areas given in tab .",
    "[ eff_ar ]  mean surface fluxes in ovii of 3700 and 1980 erg/(@xmath62sec ) , in nvi of 480 and 430 erg/(@xmath62sec ) , and in cv of 830 and 860 erg/(@xmath62sec ) for capella and procyon respectively .",
    "we therefore recover our previous finding that capella s and procyon s surface fluxes are quite similar , and determine in addition that both stars exceed typical ( ? ) solar values by one order of magnitude .",
    "since the physical conditions of the line emitting regions are quite similar , we conclude that the coronal filling factors are larger .",
    "evaluating now the coronal pressure for procyon we find  using the densities and temperatures derived from nvi ",
    "@xmath63(nvi ) = 4.4  dyn/@xmath62 , a value also very typical for solar active regions .",
    "from the loop scaling law ( @xcite ) @xmath64 we deduce a typical length of @xmath65 cm using @xmath66  k. this value must be considered as a lower limit to the probable length scale because of the unfortunate sensitive dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath67 through @xmath68 ; @xmath67 is likely somewhat higher than @xmath66  k as suggested by the temperatures derived from the oviii data . at any rate , however , the conclusion is , that the x - ray emission originates from low - lying loops and hence also our _ chandra _ data support the view that procyon s corona has an appearance very similar to the sun s , just like the conclusion drawn by @xcite from their euve spectra .",
    "it then follows that the sizes of the magnetic loops in procyon s corona are similar to the loops found in the solar corona . adopting  for argument s sake",
    " a characteristic length of l@xmath69 = 1@xmath70 cm , we then find for capella @xmath71 cm , and possibly even a significant fraction of capella s radius .",
    "this result is somewhat puzzling . on the sun , loop structures , i.e. , magnetically closed topologies ,",
    "are occasionally found at larger heights , but they are always of low density and they never contribute significantly to the overall x - ray emission .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether this behavior is typical for active stars in general , or whether it applies only to capella .",
    "after all , capella may not be the prototypical active star .",
    "its corona is not as hot as that of other stars , it does not produce flares and its radio emission is very weak .",
