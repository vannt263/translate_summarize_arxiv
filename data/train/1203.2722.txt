    "this is a topological aspect of the surface andreev bound state  @xcite .",
    "the topological features are quite different between the superfluid @xmath0he a- and b - phases because the a- ( b-)phase is a time reversal symmetry broken ( unbroken ) state . the a - phase is a chiral superfluid with the spontaneous edge mass current while b - phase is a helical superfluid with the spontaneous edge spin current .",

    "the a - phase with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surface under the pair potential reflected on an edge has the same magnitude of this angular momentum and the same contributions from these two kinds of qps  @xcite .",

    "the depletion of the spin current by temperature within a low - temperature range is proportional to @xmath2 because the spin current from majorana qps has a quadratic energy spectrum .",
