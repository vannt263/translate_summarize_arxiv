    "in the current paper we investigate the behaviour of the pressure profile induced by a stokes wave of greatest height propagating in a fluid body of finite - depth .",
    "a stokes waves of greatest height , also called an extreme stokes waves , is a steady , periodic , two - dimensional flow , characterised by the appearance of a stagnation point on the free surface , specifically at the wave crest , which appear as cusps with an included angle of @xmath0 cf .",
    "the symmetries and regularity of steady periodic waves have been well established under a variety of conditions , including gravity waves incorporating vorticity cf .",
    "however the presence of stagnation points in the flow introduces a number of mathematical complications related to the regularity of the of the free surface @xcite , which require careful and subtle treatment when analysing the governing equations of the flows .",
    "the analytical techniques developed in this paper by means of an excision of the stagnation points allow us to deduce several key features of the pressure in the fluid flow .",
    "specifically it is shown that the pressure decreases as we move horizontally between a crest - line and a trough - line , while along these lines the pressure is stationary with respect to the horizontal coordinate . secondly it will be shown that the pressure strictly increases with depth at any point throughout the fluid domain .",
    "incompressibility and irrotationality of regular stokes waves allows one to construct a conformal map of the fluid domain with analytic continuation to the boundary , the so called hodograph transform .",
    "using the hodograph transform one may equivalently reformulate the free - boundary problem governing two - dimensional stokes waves as a fixed - boundary problem on the conformal image of the fluid domain , wherein one may readily employ several powerful maximum principles .",
    "however the presence of a stagnation point in an extreme stokes wave ensures that the hodograph transform does not have analytic continuation to the boundary ; as such the fixed - boundary and free - boundary problems may no longer be identified on the boundary .",
    "moreover , owing to the lack of regularity of the free surface , the boundary of the conformal domain lacks the necessary regularity to impose maximum principles . nevertheless by excising the stagnation point from the conformal domain , we restore the necessary regularity of the boundary to impose maximum principles and also ensure the hodograph transform is conformal throughout . then by means of a uniform limiting process cf .",
    "@xcite we may extend the application of maximum principles from the excised domain to the fluid domain .",
    "the uniform limiting process was used to great effect in the work @xcite , which proved the existence of extreme deep - water stokes incorporating cusps with an included angle of 120 degrees . moreover ,",
    "the same technique was employed in the work @xcite to prove the convexity of the surface profile of stokes waves of greatest height . in the recent works @xcite and @xcite , the uniform limiting process was effectively used to show that particles travelling on the streamlines of extremes stokes waves , in finite and infinite depth , do not form closed trajectories .    extending the methods developed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate the aforementioned qualitative behaviour of the pressure in an extreme stokes wave in fluid body of finite depth ; see @xcite for recent results concerning the pressure in deep - water stokes waves .",
    "pressure measurements within a water body are of significant importance both experimentally and theoretically . in many respects",
    "the pressure determines several physical features of the fluid body , for example governing the trajectories followed by individual fluid particles , see @xcite for some recent results on particle trajectories in regular and extreme stokes waves . from a practical point of view",
    ", wave measurements can be extremely difficult to execute @xcite and a widely used method of obtaining information is through pressure data @xcite .",
    "these pressure measurements convey information about the surface profile of the water wave by means of the pressure transfer function c.f .",
    "@xcite for some recent results in this regard . from an experimental and commercial perspective , information about the velocity and pressure beneath surface waves are crucial to the design of cost effective off - shore structures @xcite .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the free boundary problem for extreme stokes waves in the moving frame , that is to say the frame which moves with wave phase speed of the two - dimensional flow .",
    "section [ sec3 ] examines the stream function and velocity potential for the flow , which follow from the incompressibility and irrotationality of the flow , and introduce the hodograph transform defined in terms of these functions .",
    "the free boundary problem is reformulated as a fixed boundary problem on the conformal image of the fluid domain under the hodograph transform . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we prove the main theorem of this paper .",
    "theorem [ s4thm1 ] states that the fluid pressure is strictly decreasing as a function of the horizontal coordinate @xmath1 between a crest - line and subsequent trough - line , except along these lines themselves , where the pressure is stationary with respect to this @xmath1-coordinate .",
    "additionally it is proven that the pressure is a strictly decreasing function of the vertical coordinate @xmath2 , that is the pressure increases with the fluid depth .",
    "there are several structural features common to all stokes waves , which are crucial for the analysis of the flow .",
    "stokes waves are steady , irrotational and periodic wave trains , moving with fixed wave speed @xmath3 relative to the physical frame with coordinates @xmath4 . in a stokes wave of greatest height , the free surface profile @xmath5 is symmetric about any crest - line and moreover is strictly decreasing between wave - crest and wave - trough cf . @xcite . in general for stokes waves , the horizontal fluid velocity @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 are periodic and symmetric about the crest - line while the vertical velocity @xmath8 is periodic and antisymmetric about the crest - line cf .",
    "@xcite . without loss of generality",
    "it will be assumed that the wave has a fixed wavelength @xmath9 , defined as the distance between two successive wave crests ( or troughs ) .",
    "stokes waves are characterised as two - dimensional flows in a vertical plane where the effects of surface tension are negligible , and which move through an incompressible fluid body .    as with regular stokes waves ,",
    "the wave of greatest height is a steady wave form and accordingly it propagates with fixed wave speed @xmath3 . as such",
    ", we may reformulate the free boundary problem in the moving frame , which has coordinates @xmath10 , and is related to the physical frame coordinates by the transformation @xmath11 the governing equations in the moving frame are given by euler s equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the fluid domain is given by the closure of the set @xmath17 .",
    "the reformulation of the euler equations with respect to the moving frame coordinates is that the system depends on time implicity through the @xmath1-variable .",
    "thus the velocity field and pressure depend on time implicity and are of the form @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "the incompressibility and irrotationality conditions are expressed via @xmath19 in @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions are given by @xmath21 the system of equations - constitute the free boundary problem in the moving frame .",
    "the incompressibility and irrotationality of the fluid flow , as per equation , ensure that both components of the fluid velocity are harmonic in the fluid domain , namely @xmath22 the dynamic boundary conditions in equation reflect the fact that the only pressure exerted on the fluid particles there is the constant atmospheric pressure @xmath23",
    ". meanwhile the first kinematic boundary condition coincides with the fact particles on the free surface remain there while the second kinematic boundary condition reflects the impermeability the flat bed .      in the case of regular stokes waves ,",
    "the horizontal velocity component in the physical frame of an individual fluid particle is always less than the wave speed , which yields the strict inequality @xmath24 in the moving frame .",
    "hence the horizontal component of a particle s velocity is in the negative @xmath1-direction within the moving frame .",
    "the presence of stagnation points at the wave crest in a stokes wave of greatest height means the relation is no longer strict throughout the fluid body the , but rather we find @xmath25 with equality achieved only at the wave - crest .",
    "the presence of stagnation points on the free surface will ensure that the functions @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath7 are no longer real analytic , but merely continuous , in any neighbourhood of these points .",
    "however these functions are real analytic throughout the remainder of the fluid domain in the wave of greatest height , and indeed are also real analytic throughout the entire fluid domain of regular stokes waves .",
    "this regularity of the velocity , pressure and surface profile in a smooth stokes waves will be exploited to deduce several qualitative features of these functions in the wave of greatest height , by means of the uniform limiting process .    in the case of regular and extreme stokes waves over finite depth",
    ", we define the mean horizontal current on the sea bed as @xmath27 with the latter inequality a result of , having imposed the condition that equality is achieved only at the wave crest .",
    "in addition the irrotationality of the fluid flow also ensures that at any fixed depth @xmath28 below the free surface we also find @xmath29 the last inequality again assured by the fact there are no stagnation points beneath the free surface .",
    "thus we find the average horizontal current is fixed for all depths below the free surface of the wave of greatest height , and in what follows we will assume @xmath30 .",
    "the incompressibility of the fluid flow provides for the existence of streamlines in the fluid domain , with each streamline composed of the same particles at all times .",
    "this foliation of the fluid domain is defined by the level sets of the stream function @xmath31 , which is defined in terms of the velocity field as follows : @xmath32 the incompressibility condition applied to equation also leads us to conclude that the stream function is harmonic throughout the fluid domain @xmath20 and as such we must have @xmath33 therein . integrating the relations we deduce from the symmetry properties and periodicity of the velocity field that the stream function itself is periodic in the horizontal direction .",
    "analogously the irrotationality of the fluid flow provides for the existence of a velocity potential @xmath34 , which is defined in terms of the fluid velocity as follows : @xmath35 once again the irrotationality condition applied to also ensures the velocity potential @xmath36 is harmonic throughout the fluid domain @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore upon integrating and imposing the symmetries and periodicity of the fluid velocity we deduce that the function @xmath37 is also periodic with respect to @xmath1 .    integrating the euler equation",
    ", it is readily demonstrated that the expression @xmath38 is constant throughout the fluid domain , which constitutes bernoulli s law .",
    "utilising this it is possible to reformulate the free boundary problem in equations  in terms of the stream function @xmath39 and the free surface @xmath26 according to : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the relative mass flux and @xmath42 the hydraulic head .",
    "having constructed a pair of harmonic conjugate functions , namely @xmath36 and @xmath39 , we are now in a position to use these maps to transform the free boundary domain to a fixed boundary domain under the conformal map @xmath43 where we define @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45 it should be noted that the mapping in equation is conformal almost every where in the fluid body except at the wave - crest where the velocity field is no longer real analytic .    in what follows",
    "we shall apply maximum principles to the velocity field and pressure in the conformal domain @xmath46 .",
    "however owing to the periodicity of these functions it is only necessary that they be examined over one wavelength , namely between @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the free boundary domain .",
    "as such the interior domain may be effectively represented by the two disjoint regions @xmath49 along with their lateral edges @xmath50\\right\\}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\left\\{x=\\pm\\pi : y\\in[-d,\\eta(\\pm\\pi)]\\right\\}\\ ] ] corresponding to the closure of the crest - line and trough - lines respectively .",
    "meanwhile the free surface is divided as follows : @xmath51 while the lower boundary of the fluid domain is given by the sets @xmath52 corresponding to the impermeable flat bed .    under the conformal map @xmath53 the interior regions @xmath54 transform to the interior regions @xmath55",
    "given by @xmath56 meanwhile the images of the free surface and the flat bed are @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",

    "lastly we introduce the height function @xmath61 where it is immediately clear that this function is harmonic throughout @xmath20 .",
    "since the mapping given by equation is conformal every where within @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath62 is also analytic everywhere within the conformal domain @xmath46 . the free boundary problem given by equation",
    "may be reformulated in terms of the harmonic function @xmath63 in the conformal domain , thus yielding a fixed boundary problem given by : @xmath64 the second boundary condition ( on @xmath65 ) follows from bernoulli s law and the coordinate transformations @xmath66 which follow directly from the conformal transformation in equation and equations  which define the harmonic conjugates @xmath36 and @xmath39 . in a regular stokes wave the reformulation of the free boundary problem as per equation",
    "is valid throughout the fluid domain including the free boundary . in the case of extreme stokes waves ,",
    "the conformal change of variables given by equation may be implemented in the interior , and by caratheodory s theorem c.f .",
    "@xcite may be continuously extended to the closed fluid domain .",
    "nevertheless the coordinate transformation is not differentiable at the wave crest and as such the reformulation of the boundary problem fails at the point @xmath67 along the boundary @xmath68 .",
    "the map given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 is analytic in the interior of @xmath72 .",
    "additionally the function has analytic continuation to a neighbourhood of any point on the boundary @xmath73 defining the function @xmath74 , there exists a sequence of stokes waves @xmath75 which converges weakly to @xmath76 in the sobolev space @xmath77 , where @xmath78 cf .",
    "privalov s theorem ensures the sequence @xmath79 for @xmath80 approaches the extreme stokes wave @xmath81 .",
    "the uniform limiting process is the means by which the sequence of regular almost extreme stokes waves @xmath82 allows us to formulate maximum principle in the conformal domain for the functions @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 and by taking the limit of the sequence , extend our conclusions to the extreme stokes wave @xmath76 .",
    "in this section we will prove the main result of this paper which is the following :      1 .",
    "the pressure strictly decreases between the crest - line and trough - line and as such we have @xmath84 , except on the crest - line and on the trough - lines themselves where we find @xmath85 .",
    "the pressure strictly increases as we descend into the fluid domain and as such @xmath86 throughout @xmath83 .",

    "equation , it follows that @xmath90 meanwhile , the euler equation along with equations ",
    "yield @xmath91 this ensures @xmath7 is stationary with respect to the horizontal coordinate along the crest(trough)-line , from a point immediately beneath the wave - crest(trough ) to points directly beneath lying immediately above the sea bed .",
    "the velocity component @xmath92 is continuous throughout @xmath83 cf . @xcite . as such , about the wave crest @xmath93 we may write @xmath94 where the symmetry of @xmath6 about the crest - line @xmath88\\right\\}$ ] ensures the last inequality .",
    "moreover anti - symmetry ensures @xmath8 vanishes at the wave - crest , and as such the euler equation yields @xmath95 thus ensuring @xmath7 is stationary with respect to @xmath1 at the wave - crest also .",
