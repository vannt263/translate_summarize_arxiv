    "the cosmological origin of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) has been well established due to recent discovery of multi - wavelength afterglows ( costa et al .",

    ". however , we are still far from resolving the puzzle of grbs , because their `` inner engines '' are well hidden from direct afterglow observations .",
    "some grbs localized by bepposax satellite have implied isotropic energy release of more than @xmath3 ergs ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; andersen et al . 1999 ; harrison et al . 1999 ) , which forces many theorists to deduce that grb radiation must be highly collimated . obviously , whether grbs are beamed or not has become one of the most important problems that need to be solved urgently .",
    "in the literature , it is generally believed that afterglows from jetted grb remnant are characterized by an obvious break in the light curve during the _ relativistic phase _",
    ", due to both the jet edge effect ( panaitescu & mszros 1999 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ) and the lateral expansion effect ( rhoads 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the breaking point is determined by @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the jet and @xmath5 is the half opening angle .",
    "recently we have developed a refined dynamical model that can correctly describe the overall evolution of an ultra - relativistic jet to non - relativisitic phase with the expanding velocity as small as @xmath6 ( huang et al .",
    "surprisingly enough , our detailed numerical results ( huang , dai & lu 2000b ) show that the break theoretically predicted in light curve does not appear during _ the relativistic phase _ , i.e. , the time determined by @xmath4 is not a breaking point .",
    "however , an obvious break does appear within the relativistic - newtonian transition region , the degree of which is found to be parameter dependent ( huang , dai & lu 2000b ) .",
    "generally speaking , the newtonian phase of jet evolution is characterized by a rapid decay of optical afterglows , with the power - law timing index @xmath7  2.1 .    in practical observations ,",
    "the power - law decay indices of afterglows from grb 980326 , 980519 and 991208 are anomalously large , @xmath8 ( groot et al . 1998 ; owens et al .",
    "1998 ; castro - tirado et al .",

    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to study these cases numerically , based on our refined beaming model ( huang et al .",

    "our model also takes the electron cooling ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) and the equal arrival time surface effect ( panaitescu & mszros 1998 ) into account .",

    "grb 970228 is the first grb that an optical counterpart was observed .",
    "recently , evidence for a supernova was found in the reanalyzed optical and near - infrared images .",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 1999b ) argued that the afterglow observations are well explained by an initial power - law decay with @xmath88 , modified at later times by a type - ic supernova light curve .",
    "here we suggest that the initial rapid decay of @xmath89 ( beginning at @xmath90 s ) can be easily explained if a jet model was employed .",
    "this can be clearly seen from our calculations in sections 3.1  3.4 .",
    "grb 980326 provides the most strong evidence for grb / supernova connection .",
    "its optical afterglow has two distinct contributions : a power - law decaying component ( @xmath91 , groot et al .",
    "1998 ) and emission from the underlying supernova ( bloom et al . 1999 ) .",
    "similarly we suggest that the rapidly decaying afterglow component ( beginning at @xmath92 s ) is produced by beamed grb ejecta .",
    "determining the existence of beaming in grbs will be helpful to our understanding of the grb `` central engines '' .",
    "based on our refined dynamical model for beamed grb remnants ( huang et al .",
    "2000a ) , we have examined those grbs with rapidly decaying optical afterglows closely .",
    "detailed numerical results show that afterglows from grb 970228 , 980326 , 980519 , 990123 , 990510 and 991208 can be satisfactorily fitted : the obvious break in the optical light curve of grb 990123 is due to the relativistic - newtonian transition of the beamed ejecta , and the rapid fading of afterglows from other grbs is due to the relatively large values of @xmath93 and @xmath13 .",
    "we thus strongly suggest that these grbs be highly collimated .",
    "note that in all cases , synchrotron radiation during the mildly relativistic and non - relativistic phases plays an important role in explaining the rapid decaying of optical afterglows .    in our calculations ,",
    "the @xmath28 values distribute in a narrow range , i.e. , between 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "this has given some support to freedman & waxman s ( 1999 ) suggestion that @xmath28 has a universal value of @xmath94 .",
    "however our results do not support their proposal that @xmath30 has a universal value of 2.2 .",
    "our @xmath95 values distributed in a narrow range , @xmath96 .",
    "this may provide important clues to our understanding of the central engine .",
    "we note that woosley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have obtained such a small value of @xmath95 after numerically studying the collapsar models of grbs . the range of our @xmath13 values ( @xmath97  1000 @xmath44 ) indicates that some grbs may be in gaseous environments , also giving some hints on grb central engines .",
    "the jet model greatly relaxes the energy crisis for grb 990123 and 990510 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that other grbs such as grb 970508 , 971214 , 980329 and 980703 do not have rapidly fading afterglows .",
    "they should not be highly collimated ( huang , dai & lu 2000b ) .",
    "then the energy crisis is really a problem : grb 971214 and 980703 have indicated isotropic @xmath0-ray energies of @xmath98 m@xmath99 and @xmath100 m@xmath99 respectively !    the rapid fading of afterglows from grb 970228 , 980326 , 980519 has also been explained as being due to the interaction of an isotropic blastwave with a wind environment ( dai & lu 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 )",
    ". however the wind environment model could not explain the light curve break observed for grb 990123 and 990510 .",
    "as has been shown clearly in this paper , the jet model can naturally explain all these bursts , and should be more reasonable .",
    "another possibility was proposed recently by dai & lu ( 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "they suggested that the light curve break is due to the relativistic - newtonian transition of an isotropic blastwave in a dense medium ( @xmath101 @xmath44 ) , and the rapidly fading afterglows can be explained as emissions in the non - relativistic phase .",
    "it is obviously an interesting proposition and should also be paid attention to .",
