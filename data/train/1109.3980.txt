    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) located at a distance of around 60 kpc is one of the nearest galaxies .",
    "the smc is characterized by a less pronounced bar , than that seen in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "it also has an eastern extension called the wing .",
    "the wing and the northeastern part of the bar are closer than the southern parts @xcite .",
    "a large line of sight depth was found in the outer and inner regions of the smc by @xcite and @xcite respectively .    in an extensive survey of variable stars in the smc",
    ", @xcite discovered 76 rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) in the field centered on the globular cluster , ngc 121 .",
    "he found that the period distribution of the rrls in the smc is unlike that found anywhere in the galaxy and closely resembles the distribution of variable stars in the leo ii dwarf galaxy .",
    "his studies also showed that these stars are distributed rather evenly and concentrate neither towards the bar nor towards the center of the smc .",
    "he mentioned that the lack of strong stellar concentration is another property in common with the stellar populations in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also found an even and smooth distribution of rrls in the northeastern regions and the central 2.4 square degree regions of the smc respectively .",
    "@xcite used the rrls data published by @xcite to estimate the depth in the central regions of the smc .",
    "they found that the depth estimated using the red clump ( rc ) stars and the rrls are similar in the central regions of the smc .",
    "they suggested that the rrls and the rc stars in the central bar region of the smc are born in the same location and occupy a similar volume in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite presented a catalog of the rrls in the smc from optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) iii survey . from the spatial distribution of the rrls they suggested that the halo of the smc is roughly circular in the sky .",
    "however their density map of the rrls revealed two maxima near the center of the smc .",
    "@xcite showed that the older stellar populations ( age @xmath7 1 gyr ) in the smc are distributed in a regular , smooth ellipsoid .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn by @xcite from the denis near infrared survey .",
    "@xcite further investigated the dynamical origin of the bar using isodensity contour maps of stars with different ages .",
    "they found similar results for old stellar populations .",
    "a sample of 12 populous smc clusters which possess rc stars are studied by @xcite to determine the distances to these clusters .",
    "the line of sight depth of the smc is estimated as the standard deviation ( sigma ) of these distances .",
    "they found a 1-sigma depth of @xmath8 6 - 12 kpc for the smc .",
    "viewing the smc as a triaxial ellipsoid with ra , dec and the line of sight depth as the three axes , they found an axes ratio of 1:2:4 . from a spectroscopic study of 2046 red giant stars",
    "@xcite found that the older stellar components of the smc have a velocity dispersion of 27.5 kms@xmath9 and a maximum possible rotation of 17 kms@xmath9 .",
    "their result is consistent with other kinematical studies based on the radial velocities of the pne and carbon stars , which represent the old and intermediate - age stellar populations ( @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the structure of the older stellar component of the smc is a spheroidal / ellipsoidal , that is supported by its velocity dispersion .    from the analysis of young stars ( age @xmath10 200 myr )",
    "@xcite suggested that the irregular appearance of the smc is due to the recent star formation .",
    "as in the case of young stars , the large scale hi morphology of the smc obtained from the high resolution hi observations @xcite is also quite irregular and does not show symmetry .",
    "the most prominent features are the elongation from the northeast to the southwest and the v - shaped concentration in the east . the hi observations also show that the smc has a significant amount of rotation with a circular velocity of approximately 60 kms@xmath9 @xcite and a large velocity gradient of 91 kms@xmath9 in the southwest to 200 kms@xmath9 in the north east .",
    "@xcite obtained velocities for 2045 young ( o , b , a ) stars in the smc , and found a velocity gradient of similar slope as seen in the hi gas .",
    "surprisingly though , they found a position angle ( @xmath1 126@xmath11 ) for the line of maximum velocity gradient that is quite different , and almost orthogonal to that seen in the hi .",
    "@xcite suggested that this difference in the position angles may be an artifact of the different spatial coverage of the two studies ( @xcite did not observe in the north - east region where the hi velocities are the largest ) , since it would be difficult to find a physical explanation for a significant difference in kinematics between hi gas and young stars .",
    "the inclination of the smc disk in which the young stars are believed to be distributed is estimated as 70@xmath11 @xmath12 3@xmath11 and 68@xmath11 @xmath12 2@xmath11 from the photometric studies of cepheids by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the position angle of the line of nodes is estimated to be @xmath1 148@xmath11.0 .",
    "@xcite modelled the smc as a two component system consisting of a nearly spherical halo and a rotationally supported disc .",
    "the tidal radius of the smc is estimated as 5 kpc according to their model .",
    "their best fit to the distribution halo particles within 5 kpc radius was in good agreement with the observed distributions of the old ( @xmath7 9 gyr ) and intermediate age ( 2@xmath29 gyr ) stellar populations in the smc .",
    "the distribution of disc particles could reproduce the observed irregular distribution of young stars in the smc .",
    "@xcite suggested that a major merger event in the early stage of the smc formation caused the coexistence of a spheroidal stellar component and an extended rotating hi disk .",
    "both the observational and theoretical studies suggest that the old and the intermediate - age stellar populations in the smc are distributed in a spheroidal / ellipsoidal component .",
    "motivated with this result , here we study the rc stars and the rrls in the inner smc , which represent the intermediate - age and the old stellar populations respectively .",
    "this study aims to understand the structure of the inner smc and hence to quantitatively estimate the structural parameters .",
    "the rc stars are core helium burning stars , which are metal rich and slightly more massive counter parts of the horizontal branch stars .",
    "they have tightly defined colour and magnitude , and appear as an easily identifiable component in the colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "these properties of the rc stars make them a good proxy to determine the distance to a galaxy and also to understand the structure of a galaxy .",
    "previously many people have used the rc stars as a proxy for distance estimation @xcite , to identify the structures in the lmc @xcite and to estimate the orientation measurements of the lmc ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the depth of both the lmc & the smc using the dispersions in magnitude and colour distributions of the rc stars .",
    "the rrls are metal poor , low mass , core helium burning stars which undergo radial pulsations . their period of pulsation have a range of 0.2 - 1 day .",
    "the rrls are excellent tracers of the oldest observable population of stars in a galaxy .",
    "the rrab type stars have constant mean magnitude and they are used for distance estimation @xcite .",
    "the dispersion about the mean magnitude is a measure of the depth of the host galaxy . @xcite and @xcite used the dispersion of the rrab stars to estimate the line of sight depth of the lmc and smc respectively .",
    "@xcite studied the structure of the lmc stellar halo using the rrls in the lmc .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the structural parameters of the older component of the smc from the analysis of the rc stars and the rrls in the inner smc . @xcite",
    "presented the v and i bands photometric data of the 16 sq.degrees of the smc from the ogle iii survey .",
    "the catalog of the smc rrls from the ogle iii survey is presented by @xcite .",
    "both these data sets are used in this study .",
    "the mean dereddened i@xmath5 magnitude of the rc stars and the rrls are used to estimate the relative locations of different regions in the smc with respect to the mean smc distance .",
    "the dispersion in the mean magnitude is used to obtain the line of sight depth across the smc .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section deals with the contribution of heterogeneous population on the dereddened i@xmath5 magnitude of the rc stars and rrls and also to the dispersion in their mean magnitude . in section 3",
    "we explain the data and analysis of both the rc stars and the rrls .",
    "the reddening map of the smc is presented in section 4 .",
    "the results of our analysis are given in section 5 .",
    "the estimation of the structural parameters of the smc are explained in detail in section 6 .",
    "the discussion and the conclusions are presented in section 7 & 8 respectively .",
    "@xcite determined the distance to the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) as well as to the bulge of our galaxy from the dereddened apparent magnitude of the rc stars assuming a constant absolute i band magnitude for them . later",
    "@xcite and @xcite claimed that the luminosity of the rc stars is highly influenced by the age and metallicity and must be accounted for in the determination of the distance . when the controversy regarding the use of rc stars as the absolute indicator continued , they were used to estimate relative distances between regions within mcs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite used them as relative distance indicators in their studies .",
    "the rc stars in the smc are a heterogeneous population and hence , they would have a range in mass , age and metallicity .",
    "the density of stars in various location will also vary with the local star formation rate as a function of time .",
    "these factors would contribute to the range of magnitude and colour of the net population of the rc stars in any given location of the smc and hence to the observed peak magnitude and dispersion .",
    "@xcite simulated the rc stars in smc using star formation history and age metallicity relation from @xcite .",
    "they created the synthetic cmds of the smc and the distributions of the rc stars were fitted using numerical analysis to obtain the mean and dispersion of the magnitude and colour distributions .",
    "the model predicted values are used in our study to account for the population effects of the rc stars .",
    "the estimated intrinsic widths of the colour and magnitude distributions of the rc stars in the smc are 0.03 mag and 0.076 mag respectively .",
    "the rrls in the smc are also a heterogeneous population with a range in age , metallicity and mass .",
    "there are small variations in their luminosities due to evolutionary effects .",
    "these factors could contribute to the observed dereddened magnitudes of these stars and also to the dispersion of magnitude within a sample .",
    "this is discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "apart from multiple population in a given region , there could be variation in population and metallicity across the smc .",
    "@xcite did not find any different population or metallcity gradient near the central regions of the smc .",
    "@xcite obtained deep cmds of 6 smc inner regions to study the star formation history .",
    "the interesting fact they found about the six cmds is the apparent homogeneity of old stellar population , populating the subgiant branch and the clump .",
    "this suggested that there is no large differences in age and metallicity exist among old stars in the inner smc .",
    "the ogle iii survey @xcite presented the v and i bands photometric data of 16 deg@xmath13 of the smc consisting of about 35 million stars . we divided the observed region into 1280 regions with a bin size of 8.88 x 4.44 square arcmin .",
    "the average photometric error of red clump stars in the i and v bands are around 0.05 mag .",

    "for all the regions , red clump stars are found to be located well within the box shown in the cmd , with boundaries 0.65 - 1.35 mag in ( v@xmath2i ) colour and 17.5 - 19.5 mag in i magnitude .",

    "the rc stars occupy a compact region in the cmd .",
    "their number distribution profiles resemble a gaussian .",

    "the dispersions in the magnitude and colour distribution of the rc stars are used to obtain the line of sight depth of each sub - region in the smc .    to obtain the number distribution of the rc stars",

    "these distributions are fitted with a gaussian + quadratic polynomial .",

    "a nonlinear least - square method is used to fit the profile and to obtain the parameters .",
    "the colour and magnitude distributions along with the fitted profiles of a sub - region in the smc are shown in the lower left panels of figure 2 and figure 3 respectively .",
    "the parameters obtained are the coefficients of each term in the function used to fit the profile , error in the estimate of each parameter , and reduced @xmath14@xmath13 value .",
    "for all the sub - regions we estimated the peaks and the widths in the i mag and ( v@xmath2i ) mag of the distributions , associated errors with the parameters , and reduced @xmath14@xmath13 values .",
    "the errors associated with the parameters are obtained using the covariance matrix , where the square root of the diagonal elements of the matrix gives the error values .",
    "the number of the rc stars identified within the box in the cmd are less ( 100 - 400 ) for 602 sub - regions .",
    "these sub - regions are located towards the edge of the survey and in the three isolated fields in the north western region of the smc .",
    "for these 602 sub - regions we carefully analyzed the magnitude and colour distributions .",
    "because of the less number of stars the peaks of the distributions were not very clear and unique .",
    "it was difficult to fit those distributions with the profiles .",
    "as our methodology depends very much on the statistical analysis of the sample we omitted these 602 sub - regions , with rc stars less than 400 , for the remaining analysis .",
    "thus the number of regions used for the study reduced to 678 .",
    "the magnitude and colour distributions of most of these 678 regions were checked manually and found that the fits are satisfactory .",

    "the convention of the + ve and -ve z axes are such that the + ve z axis is towards us and -ve z axis away from us .",
    "the distribution of rrls in the smc looks more or less symmetric and extends from -20 kpc to + 20 kpc with respect to the mean .",
    "most of the stars are located between @xmath12 10 kpc .",
    "an extension to large distances can be seen at x @xmath10 .",
    "the outer density contours shown in figure 6 indicate that the eastern side of the smc is on an average closer to us than the western side .",
    "we calculated the average i@xmath5 magnitude of rrls in the eastern end ( x@xmath10 - 1.5 , 245 stars ) and in the western end ( x@xmath71.5 , 221 stars ) .",
    "it was found that the eastern side is 0.034 mag brighter than the western side , which makes the eastern side on an average 950 pc closer to us than the western side .",
    "similarly , the outer density contours shown in figure 7 suggest that the northern side is closer to us than the southern side .",
    "we calculated the average i@xmath5 in the northern end ( y@xmath71.5 , 133 stars ) and in the southern end ( y@xmath10 - 1.5,104 stars ) .",
    "it was found that the northern side is 0.019 mag brighter than the southern side , which makes the northern side on an average 520 pc closer to us than the southern side .",
    "thus the outer density contours of figures 6 and 7 and the quantitative estimates mildly suggest that the north eastern part of the smc is closer to us .",
    "this result is very similar to the result that obtained from the rc stars .",
    "as this effect is significant in outer regions and our study is limited to inner regions , we need more data in the outer region to securely say that the northeastern part of the smc is closer to us . from the photometric study of stellar populations upto 11.1 kpc in the smc , @xcite found that the eastern part of the smc is closer to us than the western side .    in the case of the rc stars as well as rrls , the variation in the i@xmath5 magnitude is assumed as only due to the difference in the distances .",
    "as discussed earlier in section 2 , there can be contributions in their mean magnitude from the population effects .",
    "thus the line of sight distance estimates suggest that either the rc star and rrls in the north eastern part of the smc are different from those found in the other regions of the smc and/or the northeastern regions of the smc are closer to us .",
    "the previous studies mentioned in section 2 suggest that there is no large variation in the age and metallcity among old stars in the inner smc .",
    "thus the contribution to the i@xmath5 magnitude from the population effects across the smc is expected to be minimum .",
    "the exact contribution can be understood only from the detailed spectroscopic studies of the old stellar populations .",
    "the dispersions in the magnitude and colour distributions of the rc stars are used to obtain the depth corresponding to the width ( 1-sigma ) of the 553 sub - regions in the smc .",
    "the width corresponding to depth is converted into depth in kpc using the distance modulus formula , + @xmath41 = 5log@xmath18[(d@xmath5 + d/2)/(d@xmath5 - d/2 ) + where d is the line of sight depth in kpc .",
    "a colour coded , two dimensional plot of depth is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the colour code is explained in the plot . from the plot",
    "we can see that the depth distribution in the smc is more or less uniform .",
    "the prominent feature in the plot is the enhanced depth ( depth @xmath7 8 kpc ) seen near the central regions .",
    "an increased depth of around 6 - 8 kpc is seen near the north eastern regions also .",
    "the average depth obtained for the smc observed region is 4.57 @xmath12 1.03 kpc .",
    "these results are matching well with the previous depth estimates by @xcite .    the dispersion in the mean magnitude of rrab stars is also used to estimate the depth ( 1-sigma ) of the smc .",
    "the dispersion in the mean magnitude for 70 sub - regions of the smc is estimated and converted into depth in kpc .",
    "the average value of depth estimated when the intrinsic spread was taken as 0.1 mag is 4.07 @xmath12 1.68 kpc and the average depth is 3.43 @xmath12 1.82 kpc when 0.15 mag was taken as the intrinsic spread .",
    "these estimates match with the depth estimate obtained from the rc stars within the error bars .",
    "the depth estimated using the rc stars and rrls are plotted together in figure 9 against the x and y axes . in both the lower panels ,",
    "the depth values are plotted against the x - axis and in both the upper panels , they are plotted against the y - axis .",
    "basically the depth values correspond to the extent ( front to back distance ) over which these stars are distributed in the smc .",
    "the measured 1-sigma depth ( front to back distance ) is halved and plotted along the + ve and -ve depth - axis , assuming that the depth is symmetric with respect to the smc .",
    "the red crosses correspond to the depth estimated using the rc stars and the black points correspond to the depth estimated using the rrls .",
    "the error bars for each point are not plotted to avoid crowding . in the left panels ,",
    "the black dots correspond to the depth estimated using the rrls when the @xmath38 is taken as 0.1 mag .",
    "similarly , in the right panels the black dots correspond to the depth estimated using the rrls when the @xmath38 is taken as 0.15 mag .",
    "the larger depth near the center ( x@xmath10 and y@xmath10 ) is seen for both the populations .",
    "the 18 regions in the right panels and the 3 regions in the left panels which are shown as open circles at zero depth are those for which the depth of the rrls became less than zero when the correction for @xmath38 were applied . for a large number of regions",
    "the depth value becomes less than zero when @xmath38 is taken as 0.15 mag .",
    "thus , it appears to be more appropriate to take @xmath38 as 0.1 mag for the rrls in the smc .",
    "the depth profiles of both the populations are similar , suggesting that both the rc stars and rrls occupy a similar volume in the smc .",
    "it is important to see how the dispersion in the distribution of the rrls is related to the real rrls distribution , obtained from the individual rrls distances .",
    "this comparison will help us to estimate the actual depth from the dispersion of the rrls in the smc .",
    "we halved the 1-sigma depth ( front to back distance estimated after correcting for @xmath38 to be taken as 0.1 mag ) obtained for each sub - region with respect to the mean distance and plotted in the -ve and + ve z axis as open circles against the x - axis in the left lower panel of figure 10 . similarly ,",
    "2-sigma depth,3-sigma depth and 3.5-sigma depth are plotted in the lower right panel , upper - right panel and upper left panel of figure 10 respectively .",
    "the individual rrls distances with respect to the mean smc distance are shown as black dots in all the panels of figure 10 . from the figure",
    "we can clearly see that the distribution of rrls is atleast extended upto 3.5 sigma dispersion , if we take an intrinsic spread of 0.1 mag .",
    "this 3.5 sigma width ( @xmath42 = 0.146 mag ) translates to a front to back distance of around 14.12 kpc . in figure 11 ,",
    "the depth estimated from rrls after correcting for @xmath38 = 0.15 mag are plotted over the individual rrls distances .",
    "the left upper panel shows the 4 sigma depth plotted over the individual rrls distances . from the figure",
    "we can clearly see that the distribution of rrls is atleast extended to 4 sigma dispersion , if we take an intrinsic spread of 0.15 mag .",
    "this 4 sigma width ( @xmath42 = 0.124 mag ) translates into a front to back distance of around 13.7 kpc .",
    "thus the rrls in the smc are distributed over a distance of @xmath1 14 kpc along the line of sight . in the case of the rc stars ,",
    "we have estimated only the mean distances to the sub - regions and the depth of the sub - regions .",
    "so we can not compare the real rc distribution with the width of the distribution to define the depth .",
    "since the depth profiles of the rc stars and the rrls are similar , we expect these two populations to occupy a similar volume in the smc and the rc stars also to be distributed in a depth of 14 kpc .",
    "the large depth suggests a spheroidal / ellipsoidal distribution for the above populations .      from the above section we found that both the rc stars and rrls have similar line of sight depth .",
    "the density distributions of both these populations will give a clue about the system in the xy plane .",
    "the surface density distribution , and the radial density profile are studied to understand the structure of the smc .",
    "the surface density is calculated by dividing the observed region into different sub - regions and obtaining the number of objects per unit area in each sub - region .",
    "the radial density profiles are obtained by finding the projected radial number density of objects in concentric rings around the centroid of the smc .",
    "these profiles can be compared with the theoretical models .",
    "the two theoretical models which can be used for the comparison of spatial distribution of different stellar populations in the smc are the exponential disk profile and the king s profile .",
    "the exponential disk profile is give by +   + f(r ) = f@xmath43e@xmath44 +   + where f@xmath43 and the h represent the central density of the objects and the scale length , respectively and",
    "r is the distance from the centre of the distribution .",
    "the king s profile @xcite , which is often used to describe the distribution of globular clusters , but also applies to dwarf spheroidal galaxies , is given by +   + f(r ) = f@xmath45\\{[1+(r / a)@xmath13]@xmath47 - [ 1+(r@xmath48/a)@xmath13]@xmath47}@xmath13 +   + where r@xmath48 and a are the tidal and core radii respectively , f@xmath49 is the central density of objects and r is the distance from the centre .",
    "both these profiles are used to fit the observed distribution of the rc stars in the smc .",
    "the number of the rc stars , identified from the cmd , in each sub - region of the ogle iii region are estimated .",
    "we used all the 1280 sub - regions ( each having an area of 32.6 square kpc ) in the observed ogle iii region .",
    "we estimated the number density , number of the rc stars per unit area , for each sub - region .",
    "the number density distribution of the rc stars is shown in figure 12 .",
    "the number density of rc stars in each sub - region ranges from 7500/kpc@xmath13 - 200,000/kpc@xmath13 . in this figure ,",
    "discrete points represent each sub - region and the colour denotes the number density .",
    "the plot clearly shows the smooth rc distribution with an elongation in the north@xmath2east to south@xmath2 west ( ne - sw ) direction .",
    "the colour code is given in the figure , where d denotes the red clump number density .",
    "the position angle of the elongation of the rc distribution is around 54@xmath11 for the eastern side .",
    "the plot also shows the shift in the rc density center , @xmath20 = 0@xmath21 52@xmath22 34@xmath23.2 , @xmath19 = -73@xmath11 2@xmath24 48@xmath25 ( shown as green hexagon in figure 12 ) from the optical center , @xmath20 = 0@xmath21 52@xmath22 45@xmath23 , @xmath19 = -72@xmath11 49@xmath24 43@xmath25 ( shown as magenta hexagon in figure 12 ) of the smc .",
    "the center of the density distribution shown here is very similar to the centroid ( given in section 2.1 ) of our rc sample in 553 sub - regions which are used for the estimation of dereddened magnitude and depth .",

    "the region within 0.8@xmath11 radius from the density center are divided into 16 equal area ( 28.3 square arcmin ) annuli .",
    "the number of rc stars in each annuli is obtained and it is divided by the area of the annuli to obtain the number density .",
    "thus the radial density distribution of the rc stars within 0.8@xmath11 radius from the density center is obtained and are shown as black squares in figure 13 . the best fitted exponential disk profile and the king s profile",
    "are shown in the figure as green and blue solid lines respectively .",
    "we can see that the radial density profile of the rc stars in the smc is marginally better described by the king s profile than by the exponential profile .",
    "we obtained the surface density profile of the rc stars in the whole observed area of the smc .",
    "the number density of the rc stars in the 1280 sub - regions of the smc are plotted against the radial distance of each sub - region from the density center in figure 13 .",
    "the black points in the figure denotes the surface density of the rc stars in each sub - region .",
    "the best fit exponential disk profile and the king s profile are shown as green and blue dashed lines in figure 13 . here",
    "we can see that the surface density profile of the rc stars in the smc is best described by the king s profile .",
    "the parameters obtained by fitting the radial density and surface density distributions by exponential and king s profiles are given in table 1 .",

    "but in the surface density profile we can see a spread in the points for each radii , which indicates that the volume in which the rc stars are distributed is not exactly spherical . again from the map of the surface density distribution shown in figure 12 , we can see the elongation in the ne - sw direction .",
    "thus the rc stars in the smc are distributed in an ellipsoidal system .",
    "our sample of rrls which are pulsating in the fundamental mode consists 1904 stars .",
    "the density center of our sample is @xmath20 = 0@xmath21 53@xmath22 31@xmath23 , @xmath19 = -72@xmath11 59@xmath24 15@xmath25.7 .",
    "the density center of our sample lies in between the two concentrations found by @xcite . to study the density profiles a large number of sample",
    "is required .",
    "the surface density map of the rrls identified from the ogle iii photometric maps is shown in the lower panel of figure 7 in @xcite .",
    "they identified two concentrations in the rrls spatial distribution and found that the rrls in the smc form a roughly circular strucutre in the sky which indicates that the rrls in the smc are distributed in a spheroidal / ellipsoidal volume .",
    "we model the observed system of the smc in which the rc stars and rrls are distributed as a triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "the parameters of this ellipsoidal system , like the axes ratio and the orientation can be estimated using the inertia tensor analysis .",
    "the tensor analysis used here is similar to the methods used by @xcite and @xcite , but with some modification .",
    "the tensor analysis used in the study is explained in appendix .",
    "the method described in the appendix can be applied to our sample of the rrls to estimate the parameters of the ellipsoidal component of the smc .",
    "first we applied this method only to ( x , y ) system and found that the smc rr lyrae distribution is elongated with an axes ratio of 1:1.3 and the major axis has a position angle of 74@xmath11 ( ne - sw ) .",
    "we repeated the procedure to the ( x , y , z ) coordinates of the rrls .",
    "the axes ratio obtained is 1:1.3:6.47 and the longest axis is inclined with the line of sight direction with an angle ( @xmath3 ) of 0@xmath11.4 .",
    "the position angle of the projection of the ellipsoid ( @xmath4 ) on the plane of the sky is given by 74@xmath11.4 .",
    "the data of the rrls used here contain the rrls in the isolated north western ogle iii fields .",
    "as they are discrete points in the density distribution , we removed the rrls in those fields and repeated the procedure .",
    "when we removed the rrls in those fields , the density center changed to @xmath20 = 0@xmath21 54@xmath22 38@xmath23.6 , @xmath19 = -73@xmath11 4@xmath24 52@xmath25.2 .",
    "the axes ratio obtained is 1:1.57:7.71 with @xmath3 = 0@xmath11.4 and @xmath4 = 66@xmath11.0 . here",
    "we can see that the coverage of the data plays an important role in the estimation of the structural parameters of the ellipsoid .",
    "this may also suggest that there may be a variation in the inner and outer structures of the smc .",
    "nidever et al ( 2011 ) found that the inner smc ( r@xmath103@xmath11 ) is more elliptical than the outer component ( 3@xmath11@xmath10r@xmath107@xmath11.5 ) .    in order to understand the radial variation of the inner structure we estimated the parameters using the data within different radii . at first , the analysis is done excluding the rrls in the north western fields .",
    "the axes ratio , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the rrls distribution are obtained for the data within different radii , starting from 0.75@xmath11 .",
    "the values obtained are given in table 2 .",
    "the values show that the @xmath3 is more or less constant with a value of around 0@xmath11.5 .",

    "the axes ratio has a range from 1:1.05:19.84 to 1:1.57:7.7 .",
    "the @xmath4 ranges from 60@xmath11 to 78@xmath11 .",
    "the data within 0.75@xmath11 of the density center is symmetric and the parameters obtained confirm that the rrls distribution in the smc is slightly elongated in the ne - sw direction .",
    "as the radius increases the data coverage is not symmetric and circular , and the axis ratio of x and y show an increasing trend .",
    "the surface density map of rrls shown ( in figure 7 of @xcite ) does not show large elongation , rather the map looks nearly circular with a mild elongation in the ne - sw direction .",
    "so the elongation obtained for the rrls distribution in the plane of the sky , at larger radius where the data coverage is not even , may not be real",
    ". we did a similar analysis to understand the radial variation including the fields in the north western regions . here the concentric circles with different radii are centered on the density center ( given in last paragraph ) estimated including the rrls in the north western fields .",
    "these values are also given in table 2 .",
    "from this also it is evident that there is a mild elongation in the ne - sw direction in the distribution of the rrls in the smc . here",
    "we have to also keep in mind that the density center estimation of the smc rrls is not accurate as there are two concentrations found in the density distribution shown in figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the variation in the density center also modifies the structural parameters of the distribution .    from the detailed analysis",
    "described in the last two paragraphs , it is clear that the quantitative estimates of the structural parameters of the smc are very much dependent on the data coverage .",

    "we assume the distribution to be symmetric with respect to the mean distance to that sub - region .",
    "initially we took the i@xmath5 values of the bins within 1-sigma width and converted them into z distances .",
    "as we have the number of stars in each bin we weighted and applied the inertia tensor analysis to the x , y and z coordinates .",

    "also , from figures 10 and 11 we can see that the rr lyrae distribution extends up to 3 - 4 sigma depth .",
    "hence we can take the z component to extend upto higher sigma levels ( 2-sigma , 3-sigma , 3.5-sigma , 4-sigma ) to understand the real rc distribution in the smc .",
    "we applied the inertia tensor analysis using z components which extend up to 2-sigma , 3-sigma , 3.5-sigma & 4-sigma .",
    "the parameters obtained are given in table 3 . from the table",
    "we can see that the orientation measurements of the ellipsoidal component of the smc using rc stars , where the z component extend up to 3.5 sigma is similar to the values obtained for the rr lyrae distribution excluding the north western fields .",
    "as we removed the regions with rc stars less than 400 , the north western fields are not included in the analysis .",
    "the axes ratio and the angle @xmath3 are matching well with the ellipsoidal parameters of the smc , estimated using the distribution of the rrls . the position angle",
    ", @xmath4 estimated using the rc stars and rrls are slightly different .",
    "based on the analysis described above we can say that the rc stars in the smc are distributed in an ellipsoidal system with an axes ratio of 1:1.48:7.88 . the position angle",
    ", @xmath4 is 55@xmath11.5 .",
    "the longest axis z which is perpendicular to the x@xmath53y@xmath53 plane ( obtained by the counter clockwise rotation of the xy plane with an angle 55@xmath11.5 with respect to the z axis ) is inclined with the z axis with an angle of 0@xmath11.58@xmath11 .",
    "the inclination of the z@xmath53 axis with the line of sight is very small and we can assume the longest axis to be almost along the line of sight .",
    "the quantities estimated in this analysis strongly depend on the data coverage . in order to compare the axes ratio and the orientation measurements obtained from both the populations , it is important to take the sample of both the population of stars from the same region . in the case of the rc stars regions which include the north western fields and also regions in the edges of the data set",
    "are omitted based on the selection criteria .",
    "such a truncation of the data is not done in the case of the rrls .",
    "only the rrls which are possible galactic objects are removed from the analysis .",
    "these stars are not concentrated on a particular region but are scattered . if we remove the rrls in the north western fields and the edges of the data , then the sample of rrls cover the nearly the same region as the rc stars sample .",
    "we used the rrls within the box of size size -1.8@xmath21.8 in both the x and y axes .",
    "thus the rrls in the edges of the data set and in the north western fields are nearly removed .",
    "then we estimated the parameters using this sample of the rrls and the values are given in table 4 . from the table",

    "+    we find the z @xmath1 z axis is the longest axis in the analysis of both the rrls and the rc stars .",
    "the reason for such a result is mainly the coverage of the smc .",
    "the studied data covers only the central regions thus restricting the coverage in the xy plane . on the other hand",
    "the full z direction is sampled .",
    "hence the present view of the smc based on our axes ratio is like viewing only the central part of a sphere along the z axis .",
    "such a perspective will give an elongated z axis .",
    "this is clear from figure 14 . in order to test whether the z@xmath1z axis is due to the viewing perspective , we have sampled the data similarly along the three axes .",
    "the extend of the sample along all the three axes can be made equal by taking the data only within a spherical radii ( @xmath54 ) of 2 , 2.5 and 3 degrees from the center .",
    "we took the rrls stars within these different radii and estimated the structural parameters .",
    "the estimated parameters are given in table 5 .",
    "an elongation in the ne - sw axis is seen suggesting that the elongation of the rrls in the ne - sw is a real feature .",
    "the decrease in the relative length of the z axis is expected as the selection mentioned above removes relatively more number of stars along the z direction than in the x and y directions . from table 5",
    "we can see that the inclination of the longest axis with the line of sight axis decreases from inner to outer radii .",
    "the finite xy coverage restricts further analysis of this trend .",
    "the very small value of @xmath3 ( given in tables 2 , and 4 ) estimated from the analysis of all the rrls , including those at larger z distances from the center , indicates that the decreasing trend of @xmath3 is continued to outer radii also . in table 5",
    "we can also see an increase in @xmath4 and the relative length of y axis from inner to outer region . from section 6.1 and from table 2",
    "we can understand that these two quantities are dependent on the choice of the centroid of the system .",
    "so we can not definitely say anything more about this trend .",
    "another important result to be noticed from table 5 is that even though the z axis is the longest of the three , the values of the longest and the second longest ( y ) axes are comparable .",
    "this suggests that when the coverage along all the three axes becomes comparable , the structure of the smc is spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal .",
    "the above analysis indicates that the xy extent of the smc upto which stellar populations are studied / detected plays an important role in understanding the actual structure of the smc and hence the estimation of the structural parameters .",
    "the tidal radius estimates give the radial extent up to which the stellar populations are bound to the smc or up to which they are expected to be found .",
    "@xcite estimated the tidal radius of the smc to be @xmath1 5 kpc .",
    "later @xcite suggested the tidal radius of the smc to be 4 - 9 kpc .",
    "the estimations obtained in our study from the radial density and surface density profiles of the rc stars , given in table 1 , suggest the tidal radius to be 7 - 12 kpc .",
    "there are many recent studies which found old and intermediate stellar populations in the outer regions .",
    "@xcite found that up to 6.5 kpc from the smc center , the galaxy is composed of both , intermediate - age and old population , without an extended halo .",
    "@xcite estimated the smc edge in the eastern direction to be around 6 kpc from the survey of red giant stars in 10 fields in the smc .",
    "a very recent photometric survey of the stellar periphery of the smc by @xcite found the presence of old and intermediate age populations at least up to 9 kpc .",
    "the above mentioned observational studies and tidal radius estimates suggest that the full extent of the smc in the xy plane ( 2 * 9 = 18 kpc ) is of the order of the front to back distance estimated ( 14 kpc ) along the z axis .",
    "we found in earlier sections that the inner smc is slightly elongated in the ne - sw direction .",
    "thus we suggest , that the actual structure of the smc is spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal .",
    "better estimates of the structural parameters can be obtained with a data set of larger sky coverage . in the following section ,",
    "we combine previous studies and suggest an evolutionary model for the smc .",
    "@xcite suggested that the smc may be formed due to a dwarf - dwarf merger , resulting in a stellar spheroidal component and a gaseous disk component , happened before the formation of the mw - lmc - smc system .",
    "they also suggest that since stellar populations formed before the merger event should have dynamically hot kinematics , the youngest age of stellar populations that show both spheroidal distributions and no or little rotation can correspond to the epoch when the merger occurred . as the merger event should evoke a large scale star formation event in the galaxy , the epoch of merger can also be traced from the enhancements seen in the star formation history of the smc .",
    "the most comprehensive study of the star formation history of the smc is presented by @xcite .",
    "they derived the global star formation history of the smc .",
    "they found that there was a significant epoch of star formation up to 8.4 gyr ago when @xmath5550@xmath56 of the stars were formed , followed by a long quiescent period in the range 3 gyr @xmath10 age @xmath10 8.4 gyr , and a more or less continuous period of star formation starting 3 gyr ago and extending to the present .",
    "they also found three peaks in the sfr , at 2@xmath23 gyr , at 400 myr , and 60 myr ago .",
    "their cmds do not go deep enough to derive the full star formation history from the information on the main sequence .",
    "obtaining cmds reaching the oldest main sequence turnoff is essential in order to properly constrain the intermediate - age and old population @xcite .",
    "as we study the intermediate age and old stellar populations in the smc , here we compare the star formation studies done based on the cmds which reach the oldest main sequence turnoffs .",
    "these studies go deeper and hence have smaller field of views .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have done such studies and obtained the star formation history of the smc .",
    "@xcite found a broad peak of star formation between 5 and 8 gyr ago .",
    "@xcite found two main episodes of star formation , at 300@xmath2400 myr and between 3@xmath26 gyr .",
    "they also found that the star formation rate was low until @xmath8 6 gyr ago , when only a few stars were formed .",
    "@xcite found star formation enhancements at two intermediate ages , a conspicuous one peaked at 4@xmath25 gyr old in all fields and a less significant one peaked at 1.5@xmath22.5 gyr old in all fields .",
    "the enhancement at old ages , with the peak at 10 gyr old is seen in all fields .",
    "but in the western fields , this old enhancement is split into two at 8 gyr old and at 12 gyr old .",
    "their farthest field is at 4.5 kpc .",
    "all these studies show an enhancement in the star formation in the smc around 4@xmath25 gyrs ago .    if the 4@xmath25 gyr global star formation in the smc is assumed to be due to a dwarf - dwarf merger , then according to the merger model , the merged galaxy will settle down within 1 - 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "this scenario will then demand a spheroidal component well mixed with stars older than 2 gyr .",
    "our results find that the old population ( rr lyrae stars , age @xmath7 9 gyr ) and the intermediate age component ( red clump stars , age = 2@xmath29 gyr ) seem to occupy similar volume , suggesting that stars older than 2 gyr are in a well mixed ellipsoid .    @xcite proposed that the evidence of a major merger event in the smc is imprinted in the age - metallicity relation as a dip in [ fe / h ] .",
    "they predicted that the major merger with a mass ratio of 1:1 to 1:4 occurred at @xmath1 7.5 gyr ago in the smc .",
    "based on this model they could reproduce the abundance distribution function of the field stars in the smc . as they could not correlate a peak in the star formation history of the smc at the epoch of the merger they suggested that the major merger which occurred in the smc at 7.5 gyr ago did not trigger a major star burst due to some physical reasons but proceeded with a moderate star formation .",
    "@xcite did not find a dip in the age metallicity relation of the smc , which @xcite claim to detect and suggested as the imprint of a major merger at 7.5 gyr ago . again",
    "if this merger event in the smc at 7.5 gyr old is the reason for the kinematical and morphological differences of the young and old stars then we can not expect stars younger than 4 - 5 gyr in the spheroidal / ellipsoidal distribution . as we see the rc stars which have an age range of 2 - 9 gyr in the spheroidal / ellipsoidal distribution we propose a merger event which started around 4 - 5 gyr ago as the reason for the observed distribution of stars in the smc .    a wider and larger future photometric ( ogle iv ) and spectroscopic surveys which cover both the inner and outer regions of the smc will help to understand the complete structure and kinematics of the smc",
    "@xmath57 the dereddened i@xmath0 magnitude of the rc stars and rrls are used to determine the relative positions of the regions in the smc with respect to the mean distance and it suggest that either the population of the rc stars and rrls in the north eastern regions are different and/or the north eastern part of the smc is closer to us .",
    "+ @xmath57 the line of sight depth of the smc estimated using the rc stars and the rrls is found to be @xmath1 14 kpc .",
    "the depth profiles of both the population look similar indicating that these two populations are located in the similar volume of the smc .",
    "+ @xmath57 the surface density distribution and the radial density profile of the rc stars suggest that they are distributed in a nearly spheroidal system .",
    "the tidal radius estimated for the smc system is @xmath1 7 - 12 kpc .",

    "the estimated parameters are very much dependent on the data coverage .",
    "+ @xmath57 the study of data only within concentric spheres of radii 2 , 2.5 and 3 degrees from the center , where the extent in all the three axes becomes equal , shows that the relative lengths of the z and y axes are comparable .",
    "we estimated an axes ratio of 1:1.33:1.61 with a 2@xmath6.6 inclination of the longest axis with the line of sight from the analysis of rrls within 3 degrees in the x , y and z axes .",
    "the position angle of the projection of the ellipsoid on the sky obtained is 70@xmath6.2 .",
    "our tidal radius estimates and various observational studies of the outer regions suggest that the full extent of the smc in the xy plane is similar to the front to the back distance estimated along the line of sight .",
    "these results suggest that the actual structure of the smc is spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal .",
    "+ @xmath57 we propose that the smc experienced a merger with another dwarf galaxy at about 4@xmath25 gyr ago , and the merger process was completed in another 2 - 3 gyr .",

    "the eigen vectors corresponding to each eigenvalues are given as e@xmath77 = e@xmath78 i + e@xmath79 j + e@xmath80 k , e@xmath81 = e@xmath82 i + e@xmath83 j + e@xmath84 k & e@xmath85 = e@xmath86 i + e@xmath87 j + e@xmath88 k where i , j and k are unit vectors along the x , y and z axes respectively . the transformation of the xyz system to xyz can be obtained using the transformation matrix , t which is made up of the 9 components of the 3 eigen vectors . the transformation matrix , t is given by    t = @xmath89 + from the eigen values and the transformation matrix , the axes ratio and the orientation of the characteristic ellipsoid that best describes the spatial distribution of the particles in the system can be obtained .",
    "as the moment of inertia of a system characterizes the resistance of the system to rotation , the component of moment of inertia along the major axis of the system will be least and maximum along the minor axis .",
    "thus the three eigen values which represent the moments of inertia of the three axes ( such that i@xmath71@xmath7i@xmath72@xmath7i@xmath73 ) of the ellipsoid can be written as + i@xmath71 = m(a@xmath13 + b@xmath13 ) + i@xmath72 = m(a@xmath13 + c@xmath13 ) + i@xmath73 = m(b@xmath13 + c@xmath13 ) + where a , b & c are the semi - axes of the ellipsoid such that a@xmath7b@xmath7c and m the total mass of the system . using the above relations we can estimate the axes ratio of the ellipsoid which best describes the spatial distribution of the particles in the system . the transformation matrix , t describes the spatial directions or the orientation of the ellipsoid with respect to the local reference frame ."

    "<S> the 3d structure of the inner small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is investigated using the red clump ( rc ) stars and the rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) , which represent the intermediate - age and the old stellar populations of a galaxy . </S>",

    "<S> the mean dereddened i@xmath0 magnitude of the rc stars and the rrls are used to study the relative positions of the different regions in the smc with respect to the mean smc distance . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the northeastern part of the smc is closer to us . </S>",
    "<S> the line of sight depth ( front to back distance ) across the smc is estimated using the dispersion in the i@xmath0 magnitudes of both the rc stars and the rrls and found to be large ( @xmath1 14 kpc ) for both the populations . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity in their depth distribution suggest that both these populations occupy a similar volume of the smc . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density distribution and the radial density profile of the rc stars suggest that they are more likely to be distributed in a nearly spheroidal system . </S>",
    "<S> the tidal radius estimated for the smc system is @xmath1 7 - 12 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> an elongation along the ne@xmath2sw direction is seen in the surface density map of the rc stars . </S>",
    "<S> the surface density distribution of the rrls in the smc is nearly circular . </S>",
    "<S> based on all the above results the observed structure of the smc , in which both the rc stars and rrls are distributed , is approximated as a triaxial ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the ellipsoid are obtained using the inertia tensor analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the axes ratio , inclination of the longest axis with the line of sight ( @xmath3 ) and the position angle ( @xmath4 ) of the longest axis of the elliposid on the sky from the analysis of the rrls . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the red clump stars with the assumption that they are extended up to a depth of 3.5 times the sigma ( width of dereddened i@xmath5 magnitude distribution , corrected for intrinsic spread and observational errors ) , was also found to give similar axes ratio and orientation angles . </S>",
    "<S> the above estimated parameters depend on the data coverage of the smc . using the rrls with equal coverage in all the three axes ( data within 3 degrees in x , y and z axes ) , we estimated an axes ratio of 1:1.33:1.61 with @xmath3 = 2@xmath6.6 and @xmath4 = 70@xmath6.2 . </S>",
    "<S> our tidal radius estimates and the recent observational studies suggest that the full extent of the smc in the xy plane is of the order of the front to back distance estimated along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the structure of the smc is spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the smc experienced a merger with another dwarf galaxy at @xmath1 4@xmath25 gyr ago , and the merger process was completed in another 2@xmath23 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted in a spheroidal distribution comprising of stars older than 2 gyr . </S>"
