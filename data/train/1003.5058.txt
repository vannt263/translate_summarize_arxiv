    "despite being very well confirmed by experiments thermodynamics and classical statistical physics still lack a commonly accepted and conceptually clear foundation .",
    "the reason for this unsatisfactory situation is that physicists have not yet succeeded in finding concise and convincing justifications for the fundamental axioms of statistical physics .",
    "an overview of the attempts to axiomatize statistical physics and thermodynamics and to justify the axioms from classical newtonian mechanics and the conceptual problems with these approaches can be found for example in @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "quantum mechanics claims to be a fundamental theory . as such it should be capable of providing us with a microscopic explanation for all phenomena we observe in macroscopic systems , including irreversible processes like thermalization .",
    "but , its unitary time evolution seems to be incompatible with irreversibility @xcite leading to an apparent contradiction between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "this apparent contradiction is part of the long standing problem of the emergence of classically from quantum mechanics .    to overcome this problem",
    "many authors have suggested to modify quantum theory , either by adding nonlinear terms to the von  neumann equation or by postulating a periodical spontaneous collapse of the wave function @xcite .",
    "others have considered effective , markovian , time evolutions for open quantum systems @xcite and it has been shown that system bath models that evolve under a special form of hamiltonian tend to evolve into states that are classical superpositions of so called _ pointer states _  a phenomenon called _ environmentally induced super selection _ , a term due to zurek @xcite . depending on the author subsets of these approaches",
    "are subsumed under the term _ decoherence theory _ @xcite .    in face of the enormous success of standard quantum mechanics in explaining microscopic phenomena and the additional difficulties that arise when the von  neumann equation is modified and the existence of macroscopic quantum systems on the one hand , and the broad applicability of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics on the other",
    ", we feel that neither a modification of quantum theory , nor considerations restricted to special situations can provide a satisfactory explanation of the statistical and thermodynamic behavior of our macroscopic world .",
    "consequently we will seek to derive general statements independent of particular models and we will not use the markov assumption . furthermore , we believe that neither the assumption of ergodicity nor classical or quantum chaos are good starting points for constructing a convincing and consistent foundation for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics ( see for example footnote 1 and 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the struggle for a quantum mechanical explanation of behavior usually described by statistical physics dates back to the founding fathers of quantum theory , most notably von  neumann @xcite and schrdinger @xcite .",
    "recently work on this subject was resumed and there has been remarkable success :    * in @xcite a justification for the applicability of the canonical ensemble is given that does not rely on subjective , added randomness or ensemble averages . while @xcite make particular assumptions on the hamiltonian and introduce the concept of temperature , and thereby are able to derive explicitly the boltzmann distribution , the aim of @xcite is more to show that the reduced states of random states of large quantum systems typically look like the reduced state of the microcanonical state , @xcite in addition uses time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "all these works are based on typicality arguments and the phenomenon of measure concentration @xcite .. * in @xcite it is shown how seemingly irreversible , thermodynamic behavior of macroscopic systems can be explained in the framework of standard quantum mechanics and that the approach proposed in @xcite is capable of explaining the phenomenon of equilibration in a natural way .",
    "* there are some works that investigate equilibration and thermalization in particular models @xcite . due to the additional structure in the less general situations considered in these",
    "works a more detailed analysis is possible and the authors can make assertions about the time scales on which equilibration happens . * in @xcite it is shown how the concepts of work and heat can be defined on purely microscopical grounds without using classical external driving and in @xcite the limits of purely quantum microscopic thermal machines are investigated .",
    "see also the references in @xcite for works discussing and applying definitions of work and heat based on time dependent hamiltonians and external driving . * in",
    "@xcite it is shown that a slow and continuous evolution of expectation values is typical for large quantum systems . * in @xcite it is shown that large quantum systems typically are in some sense _ ergodic _ with respect to coarse grained , macroscopic observables .",
    "@xcite was criticized in @xcite , but recently it was argued that this criticism was unjustified @xcite .",
    "* there have been attempts to derive the second  law of thermodynamics @xcite or a statistical h - theorem @xcite for the von  neumann entropy from quantum mechanics and in @xcite ( see also the older references 4 and 5 in @xcite ) a different entropy measure , `` microscopic diagonal entropy '' , was proposed to overcome the contradiction between microscopic time reversal invariance and the second  law . * in addition to the mainly analytical works cited above there exists a quickly increasing amount of numerical works concerned with equilibration and thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems confirming the analytical findings @xcite .    unfortunately the often mathematically rigorous and far reaching results of these works are almost complete ignored by textbooks on statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , this is true even for the results obtained by von  neumann in 1930 @xcite ( an exception is @xcite ) .",
    "this situation is unfortunate since some of the results mentioned above address long standing conceptual issues at the very heart of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "especially @xcite argue for a new interpretation of the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "following seth lloyd @xcite we called this approach _ pure state quantum statistical mechanics_. in what follows we give a concise and self contained review of the results of these and other related works in a unified and consistent notation . in the first section we introduce the general setup and fix the notation .",
    "we then review the recent progress in the field and present additional new results concerning the justification of the applicability of the microcanonical and canonical ensemble , equilibration , ergodicity and initial state independence .",
    "finally we show that these results imply a statistical quantum second  law of thermodynamics .",
    "we consider arbitrary quantum systems that can be described using a hilbert space @xmath17 of finite dimension @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that all observables , including energy , are bounded linear operators , i.e have a finite operator norm",
    ".    we will often talk about systems that can be divided into two parts , which we will call the bath @xmath13 and the subsystem @xmath12 , such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the hilbert spaces of the subsystem and the bath respectively .",
    "it shall be emphasized that we will not make any special a priori assumptions about the size and structure of the bath and system .",
    "all results will be completely general .",
    "the only reason why we call one part the bath and the other the subsystem is that in the end we will be interested in situations where the dimension @xmath22 of the hilbert space @xmath21 of the bath is much larger than the dimension @xmath23 of the hilbert space @xmath20 of the system .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the set of all projectors on @xmath17 and by @xmath25 the set of all rank @xmath26 projectors on @xmath17 .",
    "we write @xmath27 and @xmath28 for normalized pure state vectors and use @xmath29 and @xmath30 to denote their associated pure density matrices in @xmath31 .",
    "the set of all , possibly mixed , normalized density matrices on @xmath17 , i.e. the set of all positive - semidefinite hermitian matrices with trace one , will be denoted by @xmath32 and we will use the symbols @xmath33 and @xmath34 for , possibly mixed , states from @xmath32 .",
    "their reduced states , or marginals , on the subsystem and bath are indicated by superscript letters like in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the joint system @xmath37 has @xmath18 energy eigenstates @xmath38 with corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath39 that we will assume to be given in units of @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian governs the time evolution of the joint system .",
    "if the initial state of the system was @xmath41 we will denote the state at time @xmath42 by @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the hamiltonians considered herein are completely general except for one extremely weak constraint , namely that they have _ non - degenerate energy gaps _ or are _ non - resonant_. this assumption imposes a restriction on the equality of the gaps between energy eigenvalues , namely @xmath45 note that there are two slightly different versions of this assumption : in the first , stronger version the indices @xmath46 run over all eigenstates of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "this version implies that the spectrum of the hamiltonian is non - degenerate . in the weaker version",
    "the indices run only over all distinct eigenvalues , so that degeneracies in the energy spectrum are allowed as long as the gaps between the degenerate subspaces are non - degenerate .",
    "it shall be emphasized that even the stronger version is an extremely weak restriction as every hamiltonian can be made to be non - resonant by adding an arbitrary small random perturbation .",
    "generic hamiltonians have non - degenerate energy gaps .",
    "every hamiltonian becomes non - degenerate by adding an arbitrary small random perturbation ; therefore the hamiltonians of macroscopic systems can be expected to satisfy this constraint .",
    "the physical implication of this assumption is that the hamiltonian is _ fully interactive _ in the sense that there exists no partition of the composite system into a subsystem and bath such that the hamiltonian can be written as a sum @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 act on the subsystem and bath alone .    in the following",
    "we will use the stronger version of the non - degenerate energy gaps assumption for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , results similar to the ones presented herein hold under the second , weaker version .",
    "basically , what one has to do is replace projectors onto energy eigenstates @xmath51 by projectors onto degenerate subspaces and refine some of the quantities appearing in the theorems , in particular the _ effective dimension _",
    "( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the consequence of the non - degenerate energy gaps assumption that we exploit in the present work is that time averaging a state @xmath52 that evolves under such a hamiltonian @xmath53 gives the same result as dephasing the initial state with respect to the energy eigenbasis of @xmath54 @xmath55 : = \\sum_k { | e_k \\rangle \\langle e_k | } \\rho_0 { | e_k \\rangle \\langle e_k | } .\\ ] ] we will therefore use the letter @xmath56 $ ] to refer to time averaged and dephased states respectively .",
    "in what follows we will often talk about _ random pure states _",
    "drawn from some subspace @xmath57 . unless explicitly stated otherwise by a random pure state we mean a state that was chosen according to the haar measure on @xmath57 , which is the unique unitary left and right invariant measure on @xmath58 @xcite ( see appendix  [ appendix : thehaarmeasure ] for more information ) .      in conventional statistical mechanics",
    "probabilities , expectation values , variances and higher moments of observables are computed via ensemble averages .",
    "depending on the situation under consideration one must employ the microcanonical , canonical or the appropriate grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approach is beyond all doubt and the results obtained using it have been confirmed by innumerous experiments .    on the other hand ,",
    "the role of probability @xcite in physics , the problem of ergodicity and especially the microscopic justification of the second  law of thermodynamic are very subtle issues and many fundamental questions concerning them are still open despite many decades of research @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our discussion will be to show how the applicability of ensemble averages can be justified using quantum mechanics and measure concentration techniques without any extra assumptions .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is in some sense the most fundamental ensemble . in classical statistical physics",
    "it is applied to closed systems in equilibrium .",
    "the other ensembles , canonical and grand canonical can be derived from it @xcite .    in the quantum setting the microcanonical ensemble",
    "is used in situations where all one knows about a closed physical system is that the value of some observable @xmath9 , which corresponds to a conserved quantity , i.e @xmath59 = 0 $ ] , lies in some interval @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath61 be the eigenvectors of @xmath9 and @xmath57 the restricted subspace spanned by those eigenvectors that have eigenvalues in the interval .",

    "all compatible states are assigned the same a priory probability .",
    "it is beyond all doubt that this approach to calculate expectation values has proven to be extremely useful and yields results in good agreement with experiments .",

    "the final state of a small subsystem coupled to a large heat bath is typically independent of its initial state and is completely determined by some macroscopic properties of the bath . this key feature of thermodynamic systems is expressed in the second  law of thermodynamics .",
    "the obvious example is the canonical boltzmann state which is completely specified by giving the local hamiltonian and the temperature of the bath .",
    "one would therefore like to know under which conditions the equilibrium state of the subsystem of a large quantum mechanical system is independent from the initial state and depends only on the subspace from which the bath state was drawn .",

    "<S> the capabilities of a new approach towards the foundations of statistical mechanics are explored . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is genuine quantum in the sense that statistical behavior is a consequence of objective quantum uncertainties due to entanglement and uncertainty relations . </S>",
    "<S> no additional randomness is added by hand and no assumptions about a priori probabilities are made , instead measure concentration results are used to justify the methods of statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> the approach explains the applicability of the microcanonical and canonical ensemble and the tendency to equilibrate in a natural way .    </S>",
    "<S> this work contains a pedagogical review of the existing literature and some new results . </S>",
    "<S> the most important of which are : i )  a measure theoretic justification for the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> ii )  bounds on the subsystem equilibration time . </S>",
    "<S> iii )  a proof that a generic weak interaction causes decoherence in the energy eigenbasis . </S>",
    "<S> iv )  a proof of a quantum h - theorem . </S>",
    "<S> v )  new estimates of the average effective dimension for initial product states and states from the mean energy ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> vi )  a proof that time and ensemble averages of observables are typically close to each other . vii )  a bound on the fluctuations of the purity of a system coupled to a bath .    </S>",
