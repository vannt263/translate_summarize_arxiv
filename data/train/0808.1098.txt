    "it is a great pleasure to take part in the edward teller centennial symposium and to have this opportunity to describe dr .",
    "teller s contributions to electroweak nuclear physics .",
    "his career in physics began just at the time that the nature of @xmath0 decay and the likely existence of the neutrino were first becoming clear .",
    "edward s own contributions to this story are very significant and involve both neutrino properties and the role of weak interactions in astrophysics .    experiments on radioactive nuclei had , by the late-1920s , demonstrated that the positrons emitted in @xmath0 decay were produced in a continuous spectrum , carrying off on average only about half of the nuclear decay energy @xcite .",
    "james chadwick first obtained this result in 1914 from studies of the beta decay of @xmath1pb .",
    "a particularly definitive calorimetry measurement was done by ellis and wooster in 1927 and confirmed and improved by meitner and orthman in 1930 .",
    "speculative explanations included niels bohr s suggestion that einstein s mass / energy equivalence might not hold in the  new quantum mechanics , \" and chadwick s observation that perhaps some unobserved radiation accompanied the positron .    in 1930",
    "wolfgang pauli , who bohr had once described as a  genius , comparable perhaps only to einstein himself , \" hypothesized that an unobserved , neutral , spin-1/2  neutron , \" later renamed the neutrino by fermi , accounted for the apparent anomaly  a new particle with a mass less than 1% that of the proton .",
    "his suggestion came in a letter to the participants of a conference in tuebingen that began with ",
    "liebe radioaktive damen und herren ! \" reflecting perhaps the more conservative nature of theorists of that era , he later worried : ",
    "i have done a terrible thing .",
    "i have postulated a particle that can not be detected .",
    "\" pauli first public presentation on the neutrino did not come until the 1933 7th solvay conference @xcite .",
    "decay , an analog of the electromagnetic interaction apart from the absence of the electromagnetic field .",
    "photo of fermi ( note the blackboard error ) courtesy of argonne national laboratory.,width=415 ]    today s neutron was found by chadwick in 1932 .",
    "fermi , who had followed pauli s suggestion and other developments in @xmath0 decay , in 1934 proposed a model of the weak interaction , based on an analogy with electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] , a proton bound in a nucleus is transformed into a neutron , with the emission of a positron and @xmath2 .",
    "the interaction occurs at a point , so fermi s model has no counterpart to the electromagnetic field .",
    "remarkably , apart from axial currents and the associated parity violation , this description is the correct low - energy limit of today s standard model .",
    "it anticipated future developments in which the electromagnetic and weak interactions would be unified , in the standard model and in the nuclear response to these interactions .",
    "edward teller completed his phd in leipzig in the same year , 1930 , that pauli made his suggestion of the neutrino .",
    "teller worked with werner heisenberg on the quantum mechanics of molecular hydrogen , and had benefited from the many visitors attracted to the university .",
    "one of special note was george gamow , who visited in 1930 , accompanied by lev landau .",
    "gamow had described barrier penetration in 1928 to explain @xmath3 decay , setting the stage for later treatments of nuclear astrophysics and the gamow peak .",
    "teller became an assistant at gttingen in 1931 , helping eucken and franck . through his friendship with czech physicist george placzek ,",
    "teller received an invitation to visit fermi in the summer of 1932 .",

    "this observation is remarkable in several ways .",
    "it gives the correct allowed rate in the absence of polarization @xmath18 gamow and teller suggested that the vector and axial coupling might be similar in magnitude . today",
    "s standard model describes the coupling to the underlying quarks as @xmath19 .",
    "also , while the following issue does not arise for rates  the focus of the gamow - teller paper  one could accomplish the suggested generalization of fermi s theory in two ways . in a modern notation , @xmath20 that is",
    ", one could add an axial current - current interaction to fermi s vector - vector interaction , or alternatively generalize the current to @xmath19 .",
    "the latter would have anticipated by 20 years parity violation in the weak interaction . while gamow and teller do not comment explicitly on this issue or mention parity violation , their description of the matrix elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 is curious .",
    "they speak of a linear combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17  that is , a sum of vector and axial - vector amplitudes , which they suggest would be of comparable importance .",
    "they were remarkably close to the standard model .",
    "the introduction of the gamow - teller operator was critical to efforts in the 1930s to understand the mechanisms for hydrogen burning in main - sequence stars .",
    "the initiating step in the pp chain synthesis of @xmath21he @xmath22 is a gamow - teller transition .",
    "the structure of the weak interaction  the amplitudes that might be constructed from vector ( v ) , axial - vector ( a ) , scalar ( s ) , pseudoscalar ( p ) , and tensor ( t ) terms at low energies  was not fully resolved until 30 years later .",
    "teller had another connection with this story , through his university of chicago student c. n. yang ( 1946 - 9 ) . in 1957",
    "lee and yang pointed out that parity conservation was poorly established in the weak interaction , and that its violation might explain puzzling decay properties of neutral kaons . quickly following this suggestion",
    "wu , ambler , hayward , hoppes , and hudson found an angular asymmetry in the @xmath0s produced in the decay of polarized @xmath23co , and garwin , lederman , and weinrich found highly polarized muons in pion @xmath0 decay .",
    "finally , goldhaber , grodzins , and sunyar demonstrated that @xmath0 decay neutrinos are left - handed , ruling out possibilities like s+t in favor of v - a .",
    "while the @xmath19 nature of the weak interaction may seem an old story , it has a modern connection to some very important open questions regarding the neutrino .",
    "the neutrino is unique among standard model fermions in that it lacks a charge or any other additively conserved quantum number .",
    "such quantum numbers reverse sign under particle - antiparticle conjugation , and thus distinguish particles from their antiparticles .",
    "thus we know that the electron has a distinct antiparticle , the position with its opposite charge .",
    "but in the case of the neutrino , the need for a distinct antiparticle is unclear : it is possible that the neutrino is its own antiparticle .",
    "this might prompt one to do the gedanken experiment illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] .",
    "the first step is to define the @xmath2 as the particle that accompanies the positron produced by a @xmath24 source .",
    "the second step is to determine what that particle does when it strikes a target .",
    "one finds it produces @xmath25s .     and @xmath26 , prior to the discovery of parity nonconservation .",
    "if one were to define the @xmath2 as the partner of the positron in @xmath24 decay and the @xmath26 as the partner of the electron in @xmath27 decay , then these neutrinos would appear to be distinct operationally , when their interactions in targets are tested .",
    "this would seem to require the introduction of a quantum number like lepton number to distinguish the @xmath28 from the @xmath29.,width=415 ]    next define the @xmath26 as the particle that accompanies the electron produced by a @xmath27 source .",
    "then one finds that this particle , on striking a target , produces an @xmath30 . from a comparison of the two experiments it appears",
    "that the @xmath2 and @xmath26 are distinct particles : they produce different final states when they interact in targets .    as there is no obvious quantum number distinguishing the @xmath2 and @xmath26 ,",
    "would would then be tempted to introduce one , the lepton number @xmath31 , requiring it to be additively conserved : @xmath32 this would account for the results of the  experiments \" illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] .",
    "historically this issue was connected with the early development of the cl detector famous in solar neutrinos .",
    "after pontecorvo suggested using cl , alvarez investigated various background issues , as he was considering testing @xmath28/@xmath29 identity , using reactor @xmath26s .",
    "later davis placed a cl detector prototype near the savannah river reactor to search for @xmath33 but found no ar , indicating that the @xmath2 and @xmath26 are distinct at the level of @xmath34 5% .",
    "there is an elegant way to do the savannah river experiment at the nuclear level , with neutrinoless @xmath35 decay @xcite . in this process",
    "a nucleus ( n , z ) decays through a second - order weak interaction @xmath36 with the emission of two electrons .",
    "if the @xmath2 and @xmath26 are identical @xmath37 if the neutrino is a majorana particle @xmath37 then the neutrino emitted in one neutron @xmath0 decay can be reabsorbed on a second neutron , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebeta ] .",
    "but we do not see this process in nature .",
    "thus it seems once again that the @xmath2 and @xmath26 must be distinct , carrying opposite lepton charges .",
    "as the middle panel illustrates , neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay would then be strictly forbidden : the final state of two electrons ( @xmath38 ) can not result from the decay of an initial state with @xmath39 .",
    "produced in the first decay is the wrong neutrino to complete the second step .",
    "a dirac neutrino is thus allowed by experiment , as it is consistent with the absence of neutrinoless double beta decay , a process so far not seen in nature .",
    "panel c ) shows the majorana case , including the effects of neutrino handedness .",
    "a majorana neutrino is allowed by experiment , provided the mass is sufficiently small ( so the handedness is sufficiently exact ) .",
    "this requires the majorana neutrino mass to be @xmath40 1 ev , a result compatible with other tests of mass , such as neutrino oscillations.,width=415 ]    but there is a hidden assumption in the above arguments , one that starts with the axial current introduced by gamow and teller .",
    "we can remove all references to lepton number @xmath37 so that @xmath41 @xmath37 but suppress double @xmath0 decay with a different label , the handedness of the neutrino . as the goldhaber , grodzins , and sunyar experiment would show in 1957 , because the gamow and teller spin interaction does appear with fermi s vector interaction in the combination v - a , the ( anti)neutrino emitted in @xmath27 decay is righted - handed , while the neutrino that produces an @xmath25 when scattering in a target is left - handed .",
    "thus , in the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublebeta ] , we find another mechanism for suppressing double @xmath0 decay , without the assumption of a conserved lepton number : the neutrino produced in the first beta decay has the wrong handedness to generate a neutrino by scattering off a second nucleon .",
    "these assignments do not forbid double @xmath0 decay @xmath37 we eliminated lepton number and its absolute conservation @xmath37 but only suppress it : the handedness of the neutrino is not exact because of its mass . the amplitude in panel c )",
    "is proportional to the handedness admixture @xmath42 where we have estimated the energy of the exchanged neutrino to be @xmath43 for a typical heavy nucleus .",
    "the same arguments apply to the savannah river experiment and other tests that naively suggest the @xmath28 must have a distinct antiparticle .",
    "thus this discussion shows that there are two descriptions of massive neutrinos , and _ both _ are consistent with nature , for light neutrinos .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] .",
    "the first is the two - component majorana case : the neutrino is its own antiparticle , so that under cpt the @xmath44 .",
    "one can also consider the constraints of lorentz invariance .",
    "if one boosts to a frame moving faster than a massive neutrino , momentum is reversed but not spin .",
    "the handedness is then flipped : lorentz invariance requires a right - handed counterpart to a left - handed state , and the reverse .",
    "thus a two - component neutrino can satisfy the constraints of both particle - antiparticle conjugation and lorentz invariance .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce a lepton number to distinguish the @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "lepton number reverses under particle - antiparticle conjugation , but not under lorentz boosts .",
    "thus four neutrino components are required to satisfy the constraints of particle - antiparticle conjugation and lorentz invariance .",
    "this is the dirac case of fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] .",
    "our minimal standard model of particle physics does not allow neutrino mass : dirac masses are absent because there is no right - handed neutrino field , and majorana masses are absent because they require interactions that are poorly behaved at high energies .",
    "but neither of these standard - model restrictions is likely to hold in the more general models that will someday replace the standard model ; nor is the second concern of any importance if one adopts a modern view that the standard model is an effective theory that should be restricted to lower energies .",
    "we now know a new , extended standard model is needed , because neutrinos are massive .",
    "the super - kamiokande and sno experiments have demonstrated that atmospheric and solar neutrinos oscillate .",
    "while oscillation experiments constrain differences in the squares of neutrino masses , those differences tell us that at least one neutrino has a mass @xmath45 0.04 ev .",
    "we also have the @xmath28 mass bounds @xmath46 the former comes from combining tritium @xmath0 decay mass limits with mass differences @xmath47 known from oscillation experiments , while the later is derived from cosmological arguments , that massive neutrinos inhibit the growth of structure on large scales .",
    "this chain of argument leads to an interesting observation : while we must look to extended models for an explanation of neutrino mass , it is at first not clear how a more unified theory can account for neutrino masses , since they are so much smaller than the masses of other standard model particles .",
    "a group theory factor is not going to generate the factor of 10@xmath48 or more to explain the ratio @xmath49 .",
    "but a elegant resolution of this puzzle is provided by the special freedom available with neutrinos , the possibility of both dirac and majorana mass terms @xcite .",
    "neutrinos and other standard - model fermions can share the same dirac mass scale @xmath50 .",
    "but the seesaw mechanism , in addition , postulates a heavy right - handed majorana neutrino mass @xmath51 , yielding a mass matrix @xmath52 thus a natural  small parameter \" @xmath53 emerges that explains why neutrinos are so much lighter than other fermions .",
    "the scale @xmath51 represents new physics .",
    "if one takes @xmath54 one finds an @xmath51 that is very close to the energy scale where supersymmetric grand unified theories predict that the strong , weak , and electromagnetic forces unify .",
    "thus it is quite possible that tiny neutrino masses are giving us our first glimpse of physics that is otherwise hidden by an enormous energy gap .",
    "in 1946 edward teller left los alamos to join enrico fermi and maria mayer at the university of chicago . in 1948 maurice goldhaber , then at the university of illinois , approached teller about the broad photoabsorption resonances he had observed in @xmath55,n ) nuclear reactions ",
    "the nuclear response was similar to related phenomena in crystal lattices that teller had considered years earlier .",
    "out of these discussions emerged a simple collective model of the giant dipole resonance in which the neutrons oscillate against the protons , with the nuclear symmetry energy generating a linear restoring force .",
    "this single harmonic mode could be constructed to satisfy the energy - weighted @xmath56 sum rule @xmath57 figure  [ fig : goldhaber ] illustrates the mode .",
    "this celebrated paper @xcite also has a connection with neutrinos and with the gamow - teller suggestion of a semi - leptonic weak interactions mediated by a combination of vector and axial - vector currents .",
    "once the model is constructed to saturate the @xmath56 sum rule , it can be generalized algebraically to account for the full 15-dimensional super - multiplet of dipole resonances , if it is assumed nuclear forces are independent of spin and isospin .",
    "this yields a set of su(4 ) generalizations of the @xmath56 mode which saturate the ( l=1 s t ) responses for the allowed choices of spin s and isospin t.        one can envision this pictorially as a generalization of the proton / neutron fluid oscillations of the original goldhaber - teller model to fluids that also carry spin .",
    "for example , the axial responses needed to describe neutral current neutrino scattering involve the substitution @xmath58_{j=0,1,2 } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\tau_3(i ) \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] an example of such a spin - dependent mode is given in fig .  [",
    "fig : goldhaber ] : a fluid consisting of spin - up protons and spin - down neutrons oscillates against one with spin - up neutrons and spin - down protons .",
    "thus this is an l=1 s=1 t=1 mode .    despite its great simplicity",
    ", this generalized goldhaber - teller model captures enough of the basic physics of first - forbidden nuclear responses to be a useful tool for calculations .",
    "one  homework \" problem @xcite that can be solved with this model is  how did the galaxy make the fluorine found in toothpaste ? \"",
    "that data needed for the solution include :    * fluorine has a single stable isotope , @xmath59f , and is relatively rare .",
    "its galactic abundance relative to neon is 1/3100 . *",
    "galactic core - collapse supernovae occur about once every 30 years . *",
    "such supernovae are thought to be the primary source of ne , which is synthesized from  burning \" oxygen in the supernova progenitor star during the long period of hydrostatic evolution , then ejected with the rest of the mantle during the explosion .",
    "* each supernova releases about @xmath60 muon and tauon @xmath28s . *",
    "as these @xmath28s have an average energy of @xmath34 25 mev , most can excited giant resonances when scattering off ne .",
    "* as the typical radius of the ne shell is about 20,000 km , the total fluence of @xmath28s through this shell during the few seconds of the explosion is @xmath61/@xmath62 .",
    "although the average neutrino energy @xmath63 25 mev , cross section kinematics yields makes neutrinos on the high - energy tail of the boltzmann distribution much more important . furthermore , neutrinos scattering backward can transfer a three - momentum @xmath64 .",
    "consequently the inelastic scattering is dominated by the first - forbidden responses , the giant resonances .",
    "while the original goldhaber - teller model was designed to saturate the sum rule for the @xmath65 nuclear response , its su(4 ) generalization addresses the full set of giant resonances important to both axial and vector currents .",
    "that is , it provides a reasonable model for @xmath66 where @xmath67 , the boson mediating neutrino - nucleus scattering , is the analog of the @xmath68 in goldhaber s photoexcitation experiments . summing over the spin and isospin modes yields @xmath69    the direct synthesis of new elements by supernova neutrinos",
    "is called the neutrino process . when calculations only slightly more sophisticated than the above are combined with nuclear reaction networks that include the effects of the processing of the neutrons and protons coproduced with the @xmath59ne and @xmath59f , as well as effects of shock - wave heating of the ne shell",
    ", one finds that the correct ratio of @xmath59f/@xmath70ne is obtained for a heavy - flavor neutrino temperature of @xmath34 6 mev .",
    "this is very similar to the temperatures supernova modelers obtain from detailed hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "edward teller s career in nuclear physics spanned 70 years and encompassed many subjects not addressed here .",
    "however , the two papers chosen for discussion are notable for their physics insight and their historical setting .",
    "gamow and teller introduced a spin - dependent @xmath0 decay amplitude that anticipated the axial - vector current of the standard model and the 1957 discoveries that established the v - a form of the weak interaction .",
    "the resulting handedness of the neutrino provides an explanation for suppressed double @xmath0 decay rates , thereby keeping open the possibility of majorana neutrino masses . because neutrinos can have both majorana and dirac mass terms",
    ", a natural explanation arises for the difference between the neutrino mass scale and that of other fermions  but one not yet confirmed experimentally .",
    "goldhaber and teller introduced a simple nuclear model capable of saturating the @xmath56 photoabsorption sum rule .",
    "this model has a natural generalization for weak charged- and neutral - current responses , if the nuclear hamiltonian is assumed be independent of spin and isospin .",
    "while the gamow - teller paper described for the first time the full set of operators responsible for allowed transitions , and goldhaber - teller model and its su(4 ) generalization provided a similar description for the first - forbidden responses .",
