    "exactly soluble quantum spin models belong to the most fascinating topics to deal with in the area of modern equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that quantum effects usually compete with a cooperative nature of spontaneous long - range ordering and thus , it is quite intricate to find an exactly solvable model that simultaneously exhibits both spontaneous long - range order as well as obvious macroscopic features of quantum origin . on the other hand , it is a competition between quantum and cooperative phenomena that is an essential ingredient for observing a quite remarkable and unexpected behavior of low - dimensional quantum spin models .",
    "the hybrid ising - heisenberg models on decorated planar lattices , whose nodal sites are occupied by the classical ising spins and decorating sites by the quantum heisenberg ones , belong to the simplest rigorously solved quantum spin models that exhibit a spontaneous long - range ordering with apparent quantum manifestations .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark , moreover , that the ising - heisenberg planar models @xcite where a finite cluster of the heisenberg spins interacts with either two or three nodal ising spins are in principle tractable by the use of generalized decoration - iteration or star - triangle transformations @xcite , which establish a precise mapping equivalence between them and the spin-1/2 ising model on the corresponding undecorated planar lattice @xcite . among other matters , the exact solutions for this special class of the ising - heisenberg planar models might serve in evidence that these rigorously solvable models exhibit a strong - universal critical behavior , which can be characterized by critical exponents from the standard ising universality class .",
    "contrary to this , the more interesting weak - universal behavior @xcite of the critical exponents has been recently announced for two ising - heisenberg planar models @xcite , where a finite cluster of the heisenberg spins interacts with four nodal ising spins . the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair @xmath0 heisenberg interaction and two quartic ising interactions",
    "@xcite has surprisingly turned out to be the fully exactly solvable model due to a validity of the precise mapping equivalence with baxter s zero - field ( symmetric ) eight - vertex model @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to examine in detail how the weak - universal critical behavior of this exactly soluble model depends on a spatial anisotropy in two quartic ising interactions and on the exchange anisotropy of the @xmath0 heisenberg pair interaction , whose effect have not been dealt with in our preceding work @xcite for the most general case .",
    "this paper is so organized . in the following section",
    ", we will describe the hybrid ising - heisenberg model and recall basic steps of the exact mapping procedure to the zero - field eight - vertex model .",
    "the most interesting results for the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , which are supported by a detailed analysis of critical exponents , are subsequently presented in the next section .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are mentioned along with a brief summary of the most important scientific achievements in the last section .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional lattice of edge - sharing octahedrons .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] schematically displays the elementary unit cell of the two - dimensional lattice , i.e. an octahedron , which contains four ising spins @xmath1 in its basal plane and two heisenberg spins @xmath2 in its apical positions .",
    "let each edge of the octahedron , which connects two ising spins , be a common edge of two adjacent octahedrons so that an ensemble of all ising spins will form a square lattice and the heisenberg spins will be located above and below a center of each elementary square face .",
    "suppose furthermore that both apical heisenberg spins interact together via the pair @xmath0 heisenberg interaction ,     heisenberg interaction between the apical heisenberg spins and both types of broken lines connect spins involved in the quartic ising interactions .",

    ", the total hamiltonian can be written as a sum over all elementary unit cells ( octahedrons ) @xmath3 , where each cluster hamiltonian @xmath4 contains one pair interaction between the apical heisenberg spins and two quartic ising - type interactions between the heisenberg spins and their four ising neighbors @xmath5 above , the interaction parameters @xmath6 label spatial components of the anisotropic @xmath0 interaction between the heisenberg spins , while the interaction parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 label two quartic ising - type interactions between both apical heisenberg spins and two ising spins from opposite corners of a square face along two different diagonal directions ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the crucial step of our calculation lies in an evaluation of the partition function .",
    "a validity of the commutation relation @xmath9 = 0 $ ] between different octahedron - cluster hamiltonians allows a partial factorization of the partition function into the following product @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath13 is the absolute temperature .",

    "it should be also mentioned that the critical exponents of the zero - field eight - vertex model @xcite continuously change with the parameter @xmath39 by following the formulas @xmath40 consequently , the relations ( [ ce ] ) will also govern changes of the critical exponents of the ising - heisenberg model when the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) are used for a calculation of the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "in this part , let us proceed to a discussion of the most interesting results obtained for critical properties of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair and quartic interactions .",
    "before doing so , however , it is worthy of notice that some special cases of this model system have already been investigated by the present authors in our earlier paper @xcite , where the critical behavior of the particular case with two identical quartic interactions @xmath42 and the more symmetric @xmath43 heisenberg interaction ( @xmath44 ) was explored in detail by assuming both ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic pair interaction .",
    "exact results for this more symmetric version of the ising - heisenberg model indicate that the model with the antiferromagnetic pair interaction exhibits less significant changes of both critical temperatures as well as critical exponents than the model with the ferromagnetic pair interaction . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been demonstrated that only the ising - heisenberg model with the ferromagnetic pair interaction shows a unusual quantum critical point of the infinite order , which characterizes a remarkable singular behavior of the critical exponents near the isotropic limit of the heisenberg pair interaction ( @xmath45 ) . with this background ,",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to shed light on how this strange weak - universal critical behavior will change by introducing a spatial anisotropy in two quartic ising - type interactions ( @xmath46 ) or by assuming the most general form of the @xmath0 exchange anisotropy in the heisenberg pair interaction .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the investigated ising - heisenberg model possesses a rather high symmetry , because all four different boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) are mutually interchangeable under the transformations @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 .",
    "this means , among other matters , that one may further restrict both quartic interaction parameters to positive values , since the transformations @xmath47 and @xmath48 merely cause rather trivial changes of the nodal ising spins @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . owing to this fact , let us further assume that all the interaction terms @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 entering the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) are positive and moreover , the symmetry of the hamiltonian allows us to consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 without loss of the generality . for easy reference ,",
    "the number of free parameters is lowered by introducing the following set of dimensionless parameters : @xmath56 marks the dimensionless temperature , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are proportional to a relative strength of the quartic ising - type interactions , and finally , the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 measure a relative strength of the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath0 heisenberg pair interaction . the former anisotropy parameter @xmath59 determines a difference in the exchange interactions along a quantization @xmath61-axis and its perpendicular @xmath62-axis , whereas the latter anisotropy parameter determines a difference between the stronger and weaker exchange interaction in the @xmath63-plane .",
    "first , let us take a closer look at the ground - state behavior .",
    "it can be readily understood that the ground - state spin arrangement will always correspond to the lowest - energy eigenstate that enters into the greatest boltzmann s weight among the four boltzmann s weights given by eqs .",
    "( [ bw1])-([bw7 ] ) . in the zero temperature limit ,",
    "the greatest boltzmann s weight is @xmath64 if @xmath65 or @xmath66 if @xmath67 .",
    "this observation would suggest that the ground - state spin arrangement will basically change whenever the weaker exchange interaction @xmath52 in the @xmath63-plane exceeds the exchange interaction @xmath53 along the quantization axis .",
    "one actually finds that the lowest - energy eigenstate is either @xmath68 if @xmath65 , or , @xmath69 if the reverse inequality holds . in eqs .",
    "( [ gsa])([gsb ] ) , the former ket vector unambiguously determines the states of four nodal ising spins from an elementary square face of the @xmath16th octahedron and the latter ket vector unambiguously specifies the relevant state of the heisenberg spin pair .",
    "it should be also noticed that another equivalent representations of these eigenstates can be obtained from the eigenvectors ( [ gsa])([gsb ] ) under the reversal of all four nodal ising spins and consequently , the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 are both four - fold degenerate .",
    "let us now make a few comments on spin arrangements appearing in both ground - state phases .",
    "in the phase @xmath70 , the ising spins placed on a square lattice either exhibit a perfect ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic long - range order , which is accompanied with the entangled spin state @xmath72 consisting of both ferromagnetic states of the heisenberg spin pairs . on the other hand ,",
    "the heisenberg spin pairs reside in the phase @xmath71 the entangled spin state @xmath73 consisting of both antiferromagnetic states and the ising spins prefer a superantiferromagnetic long - range order with the ferromagnetic alignment in a horizontal direction and the antiferromagnetic alignment in a vertical direction , or vice versa . to compare with , is might quite useful to mention that the phase @xmath71 preserves its character even if the less general case of the @xmath43 exchange anisotropy is assumed , whereas the spin arrangement of the phase @xmath70 drastically changes disentanglement of both ferromagnetic states of the heisenberg spin pairs @xmath74 in the particular limit @xmath75 , the phase @xmath76 actually becomes macroscopically degenerate as the heisenberg spin pairs may choose independently of each other one of two ferromagnetic states @xmath77 .",
    "hence , it follows that the phase @xmath76 will exhibit a rather high macroscopical degeneracy of the order @xmath78 , which is proportional to the total number of the heisenberg spin pairs ( remember that @xmath35 simultaneously marks the total number of the ising spins , the total number of the heisenberg spin pairs , as well as , the total number of elementary unit cells ) .",
    "now , we will turn our attention to a detailed study of finite - temperature phase diagrams .",
    "one should recall that phase transition lines of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair and quartic interactions can be straightforwardly calculated from the critical condition of the corresponding zero - field eight - vertex model by substituting the effective boltzmann s weights ( [ bw1])([bw7 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to remember , moreover , that the greatest boltzmann s weight is either @xmath64 or @xmath66 . for both particular cases ,",

    "let us examine first how a spatial anisotropy in two quartic ising - type interactions influences the critical behavior of the model under investigation . to see this effect ,",
    "the critical temperature is plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] against the anisotropy parameter @xmath59 for the particular case of the @xmath43 exchange anisotropy ( i.e. @xmath84 ) when a strength of the stronger quartic interaction is fixed ( @xmath85 ) and a strength of the weaker quartic interaction varies .",
    "as one can see , the phase diagram consists of two marked wings of critical lines that separate both spontaneously long - range ordered phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , since both critical lines merge together at the ground - state boundary @xmath45 between these two phases .",
    "it is noteworthy that the left ( right ) wing represents a line of critical points of the phase @xmath70 ( the phase @xmath71 ) , which can be obtained as a numerical solution of the critical condition ( [ ccef ] ) by assuming the plus ( minus ) sign therein .",
    "it becomes quite evident from figure  [ fig2 ] that one may also found reentrant phase transitions slightly above the ground - state boundary between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , i.e. under the constraint @xmath86 . in this parameter region ,",
    "the reentrant phase transitions from the spontaneously ordered phase @xmath71 to the disordered phase and from the disordered phase to the spontaneously ordered phase @xmath70 take place because the free energy of the phase @xmath70 decreases much more rapidly with the increase of temperature than the free energy of the phase @xmath71 due to the much higher entropy gain of the phase @xmath70 . another",
    "interesting fact to observe here is that a spatial anisotropy in the quartic ising - type interactions does not qualitatively affect the critical behavior of the investigated model system . as it can be easily understood from eqs .",
    "( [ ev ] ) and ( [ bw5])([bw7 ] ) , the spatial anisotropy in the quartic ising - type interactions @xmath46 merely causes an anisotropy in the effective pair interactions @xmath87 of two ising square lattice coupled together through the effective quartic interaction @xmath25 when speaking in the language of the ising spin representation of the corresponding zero - field eight - vertex model .",
    "of course , it is well known that the anisotropy in those pair interactions does not fundamentally affect the overall critical behavior of the zero - field eight - vertex model .     for the ising - heisenberg model with the @xmath43 exchange anisotropy ( @xmath75 ) when a strength of the one quartic ising - type interaction is fixed ( @xmath85 ) and that of another one quartic ising - type interaction @xmath58 varies.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the sake of comparison , we have displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] the critical temperature as a function of the exchange anisotropy @xmath59 for one illustrative example of the less symmetric @xmath0 exchange anisotropy ( @xmath88 ) when a strength of the stronger quartic interaction is fixed ( @xmath85 ) and a strength of the weaker quartic interaction varies . it can be clearly seen from this figure that the finite - temperature phase diagram of this more general case quite closely resembles the one formerly discussed by the analysis of the particular case with the @xmath43 exchange anisotropy .",
    "actually , one still finds two wings of the critical lines that separate both spontaneously long - range ordered phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , whereas the zero - temperature transition between these phases moves towards the higher values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath59 as it occurs just if the weaker exchange interaction in the @xmath63-plane @xmath52 overwhelms the one @xmath53 along the quantization axis . however , the most obvious difference between the phase diagrams shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] is that the latter phase diagram does not imply an existence of the reentrant phase transitions near the ground - state boundary between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this specific feature can be attributed to the fact that the macroscopical degeneracy of the phase @xmath70 is entirely lifted whenever the most general case of the @xmath0 exchange anisotropy is assumed .",
    "hence , it follows that both wings of critical lines tend to zero temperature with an infinite gradient and thus , there does not emerge reentrant phase transitions near the ground - state boundary between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 . to provide an independent check of the aforementioned scenario , the critical temperature is plotted in figure [ fig4 ] against the exchange anisotropy @xmath59 for one selected value of the quartic ising - type interactions ( @xmath89 ) at four different strengths of the exchange anisotropy @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] apparently supports all previous statements , since the critical lines obviously have vertical tangents at the zero - temperature transition between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which is generally shifted towards the higher values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath59 upon strengthening the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath63-plane ( i.e. when the ratio @xmath60 is lowered ) .",
    "altogether , it could be concluded that the spatial anisotropy in the quartic ising - type interactions has a less significant impact on the overall critical behavior compared to the exchange anisotropy of the heisenberg pair interaction .",
    "therefore , our subsequent analysis will be mainly concentrated on how the exchange anisotropy in the heisenberg pair interaction influences the most essential features of the critical behavior .     for the ising - heisenberg model with the @xmath0 exchange anisotropy ( @xmath90 ) when a strength of the one quartic ising - type interaction is fixed ( @xmath85 ) and that of another one quartic ising - type interaction @xmath58 varies.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with a fixed strength of the quartic ising - type interactions ( @xmath89 ) at four different values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath60.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    at this place , let us make a few remarks on possible changes of the critical behavior and critical exponents , which can be induced upon varying the anisotropy parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for this purpose , the figures [ fig5][fig7 ] display typical changes of the critical temperature and the critical exponent @xmath91 with the anisotropy parameter @xmath59 for the ising - heisenberg model with a fixed strength of the quartic ising - type interactions ( @xmath89 ) at three different values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . in these figures ,",

    "it should be pointed out , moreover , that the relevant changes of the critical exponent bring also insight into a nature of phase transitions as the order of phase transitions is proportional to @xmath97 ( see for instance pp .",
    "1617 in reference @xcite ) .",

    ", the zero - temperature phase transition between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 might be regarded as a phase transition of the infinite order and hence , this special critical point in fact represents a quite remarkable quantum critical point .",

    "a disappearance of the reentrant transitions occurs on behalf of the @xmath0 exchange anisotropy , which generally lifts a macroscopical degeneracy of the phase @xmath70 , as it has been reasoned by the ground - state analysis . owing to this fact , the critical lines of both four - fold degenerate phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 should always tend to zero temperature with the infinite gradient at the ground - state boundary between them whenever the @xmath0 exchange anisotropy is considered .",
    "the quite interesting situation thus appears if there is a small but non - zero exchange anisotropy between both interactions in the @xmath63-plane ( see figure [ fig6]b ) . in this particular case ,",
    "both critical lines meet at the ground - state boundary between the phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 with an infinite gradient but they curve in the same direction at small enough temperatures , which gives rise to another type of the reentrant phenomenon @xcite . naturally , the greater a difference between the exchange interactions @xmath51 and @xmath52 is , the smaller is a temperature range where the reentrant phenomenon may be observed .",
    "in this work , the critical properties of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model with the pair @xmath0 heisenberg interaction and two quartic ising - type interactions have been studied in particular within the exact mapping technique based on the generalized star - square transformation .",
    "this algebraic transformation establishes an exact mapping equivalence between the proposed ising - heisenberg model and the baxter s zero - field ( symmetric ) eight - vertex model , which has been subsequently used for obtaining several interesting exact results for the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams , phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "the most interesting finding to emerge from the present study is an exact evidence of the quantum critical point , which appears whenever the weaker exchange interaction in the @xmath63-plane equals the exchange interaction @xmath53 along the quantization axis , i.e. whenever @xmath101 .",
    "it turns out that the critical exponents exhibit a peculiar singular behavior in a close vicinity of this quantum critical point , which consequently represents a phase transition of the infinite order .",
    "the main emphasis of the present paper was to provide a deeper insight into how a spatial anisotropy in two quartic ising - type interactions and the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath0 heisenberg pair interaction influence the striking weak - universal critical behavior .",
    "it has been shown that a spatial anisotropy in two quartic ising - type interactions has less pronounced effect on the critical behavior , which changes quantitatively rather than qualitatively upon varying the anisotropy in two quartic ising - type interactions .",
    "on the other hand , the exchange anisotropy in the @xmath0 heisenberg pair interaction significantly changes the overall critical behavior , namely , it enables to change a location of the quantum critical point as well as an appearance ( or disappearance ) of the reentrant phase transitions .",
