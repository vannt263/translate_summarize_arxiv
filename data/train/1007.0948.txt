    "the tangle model was introduced by ernst and sumners @xcite as a tool for understanding the action of certain proteins , * site - specific recombinases * , on dna .",
    "if the initial dna molecule is circular , this reaction can form dna knots and links . in this setting , the circular dna molecules are decomposed into a collection of tangles , and the protein action is modelled as replacing one particular tangle @xmath0 with another , @xmath1 .",
    "information on the knot or link type of the resulting dna can then be used in conjunction with the tangle model to help determine both structural and mechanistic information about site - specific recombination .",
    "this approach has been carried out successfully in many situations ( @xcite ) .",
    "these treatments have been restricted to the case where the dna products are exclusively prime knots and links .",
    "however , experiments show that , in certain situations , it is possible to obtain products which are nontrivial connected sums @xcite .",
    "the previous analysis relies on the cyclic surgery theorem @xcite .",
    "this approach breaks down for composite knots , essentially because their double branched cover do not have cyclic group . in this paper",
    ", we extend the tangle model to be able to deal with these non - prime cases .",
    "in particular , we prove that if the distance between the parental tangle @xmath0 and the recombinant tangle @xmath1 is greater or equal than 2 , then only the obvious locally knotted solutions may occur .",
    "we also give some restrictions on the solutions for the much more difficult distance one case .",
    "in particular , we completely describe the situation for montesinos tangles .",
    "we illustrate this by applying the results to the hin recombinase , a protein present in the bacteria _",
    "salmonella enterica_.    0.1 in this work is organised as follows : in section 2 , we give an introduction to site - specific recombination , followed by a description of the hin recombinase system , which acts as a motivation for the work to follow . in section 3",
    ", we give a brief review of tangles , which are the natural objects of study in topological models of site - specific recombination .",
    "section 4 contains the bulk of our theoretical work : we formulate a tangle model for the occurrence of composite products , and we relate it to the problem of exceptional dehn fillings on simple manifolds at maximal distance . here",
    ", we show that there are no rational tangle attachments to a prime tangle yielding a 4-plat and then a connected sum of 4-plats . in section 5",
    ", we solve the tangle equations arising from the processive hin recombination on mutated sites . in section 6 , we combine this with our results from section 4 to obtain the complete set of tangle solutions to the equations arising from distributive hin recombination ( theorem [ ti ] ) .",
    "we conclude in section 7 by discussing future directions for research .",
    "site - specific recombination is a fairly broad term that is used to describe a localised protein reaction in which two double stranded dna segments ( possibly belonging to the same dna molecule ) are brought together , cut , rearranged and resealed in some particular manner .",
    "this results in a variety of local operations on the genome of organisms , such as insertion of segments , a key step in viral infections , or inversion of a particular sequence , which can be a way to regulate gene expression ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this process can be described in more detail as follows : in a first step , recombinases detect each individual specific dna sequence and bind to it .",
    "typically , four protein molecules bind to two sites ( two molecules for each segment ) .",
    "the two segments are then brought together , either by protein action or random thermal motion , and juxtaposed .",
    "the juxtaposed sites are known as the * crossover sites*. the trapped dna together with the protein is known as the * synaptosome*. in a second stage of the reaction , dna strands are cleaved , exchanged and resealed within the synaptosome complex . a total of four such reactions occur , one for each strand , effectively disconnecting each crossover site . a final stage of the reaction involves the breaking down of the synaptosome , and the disassociation of the protein from the dna .",
    "before this occurs , the protein can immediately cleave again and perform one more round of recombination .",
    "this phenomenon is known as * processive recombination*. naturally , proteins may act on dna which has already undergone one or more full recombination events , and this is known as * distributive recombination*.      our work will focus chiefly on the particular case of hin - mediated recombination , which we describe in more detail .",
    "hin is a site - specific recombinase from the serine family .",
    "it is found _ in vivo _ in members of the _ salmonella _ family of bacteria , for example _ salmonella enterica_. its primary function is to regulate the expression of the _ flic _ and _ flib _ genes .",
    "these genes are involved in the synthesis of the _ flagellum _ of the bacteria .",
    "flagellum _ is a tail - like structure present in some bacteria , and it is their primary source of locomotion through media .",
    "a primary constituent of the _ flagellum _ is the protein known as flagellin .",
    "this helps the _ flagellum _ achieve a helicoidal structure , which favours locomotion .",
    "it is precisely the synthesis of this protein that flic and flib regulate .",
    "depending on the state of activity of these genes , slightly different versions of flagellin will be assembled .",
    "this phenomenon is known as * flagellar phase variation*. recombination by hin inverts a particular dna sequence , thereby acting as an `` on - off '' switch for gene expression .",
    "it acts on a so - called @xmath2 segment , containing the regions that code for _ flib _ and _ flic_. it is known that , when @xmath2 is in standard position , expression of _ flic _ is inhibited , resulting in one type of flagellar phase , whereas when @xmath2 is in inverted position , _ flib _ is inhibited and _ flic _ is expressed , resulting in the alternative flagellar variety .",
    "this is described in more detail by kutsukake _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "0.1 in @xmath2 is a 996 base pair ( bp ) sequence , with two specific sites , each of length 26bp , at its extremes .",
    "these sites are designated _ hixl _ and _ hixr _ , and it is known that these are the specific sites that hin binds to .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the known bp sequence for _ hixl_. the two letter subsequence @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 , depending on the strand ) in bold is the region where dna cleavage takes place .",
    "cleavage occurs along the region specified by the gray line .",
    "site has a slightly different sequence , but it also contains the cleavage sites highlighted .",
    "the hin mediated inversion reaction is catalysed by enhancer proteins hu and fis . in the @xmath2 segment , there is also a 65bp long * enhancer sequence*. during the inversion reaction , two pairs of molecules of fis bind to the enhancer sequence to help form the synaptic complex : see figure 3 ( the enhancer sequence is unaffected during subsequent stages of recombination ) .",
    "the synaptosome consists then of four subunits of hin , bound in pairs to each of the recombination sites .",
    "following the terminology of @xcite , we will henceforth name it the * invertasome*.          0.1 in in @xcite , heichman _",
    "et al _ performed a series of experiments with hin _ in vitro _",
    ", on both `` standard '' and mutated circular dna molecules . to create the mutants , heichman and colleagues introduced a small mutation at the cleavage site of _ hixl _ , replacing @xmath3 by @xmath5 .",
    "these molecules were then recombined by hin , and the resulting knot types were analysed both by agarose gel techniques and by electron microscopy .",
    "the tangle analysis of this system is essentially carried out in vazquez and sumners @xcite , and we refer the reader to it for details . ] .",
    "the electron microscopy results for recombination on mutated sites are displayed in figure [ lhtrefoil ] .",
    "therefore , we have a sequence of reaction products as @xmath6 .",
    "there is also the occurrence of a non - prime knot @xmath7 .",
    "the agarose gels also reveal the formation of a 7 crossing knot , the knot type of which was not imaged via electron microscopy",
    ".     twist knot , and a composite knot @xmath7 . taken from @xcite ]",
    "the spectrum of knots observed led heichman _",
    "et al _ to propose the following strand exchange mechanism for the action of hin : cleavage occurs at the sites , in the standard manner for a serine recombinase , and then a 180@xmath8 clockwise turn is performed at each recombination round , as illustrated in figure [ invertassome ] : this is in accordance with the products that were observed . with this scheme ,",
    "it is also easy to explain the spectrum of products observed for the action on mutant sites , namely the absence of figure - eight knots and 6 crossing twist knots : upon performing the first round of rotation , hin tries to reseal the strands , but it finds that there is a mismatch in the sequence ( _ i.e. _ the strands are not complementary ) .",
    "this causes the system to undergo an additional round of recombination in order to achieve a configuration that is consistent with base pair complementarity : see figure [ rotate ] .            as for",
    "the step that produces @xmath7 and other non - prime knots , this can not come from processive recombination , since this only produces twist knots , which are prime .",
    "the most likely explanation is that this product arises when hin performs distributive recombination .",
    "it is conceivable that hin could perform one round of recombination , resulting in @xmath9 , before releasing dna .",
    "it could then bind once more to form a new invertasome , keeping the knotted arc in the outside unbound dna .",
    "after one round of recombination , this would produce @xmath7 .    0.1 in we",
    "are thus motivated to apply the tangle model of ernst and sumners to give mathematical confirmation of these predictions .",
    "our main goals are the following :    1 .   to describe the formation of the knots",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and the 7-crossing knot , as far as the topological mechanism of strand exchange is concerned .",
    "2 .   to describe , in terms of an appropriate tangle model , the formation of composite knots @xmath7 as reaction products .    the first item will be in the same spirit of the aforementioned classical tangle model .",
    "the second step , however , will require a slightly new approach to the tangle model , not so much in formulation , but in the techniques required to solve it .",
    "we postpone the details of this until section 4 , after we have defined the mathematical objects under scrutiny , the tangles .",
    "tangles were first introduced by conway @xcite , as part of a scheme to develop a more efficient notation for enumerating knots . since then , quite a lot of work has been done on them , and they are a rich source of examples in dehn surgery , for they provide a fairly friendly way to visualise the properties of some 3-manifolds ( for a comprehensive discussion of this , see gordon @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by making the definition :    a * tangle * is a topological triple @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is ( pl or smoothly ) homeomorphic to a 3-ball , @xmath13 is a pair of arcs properly embedded in @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is an orientation - preserving embedding @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unit 2-sphere in euclidean space , centred at the origin , together with a choice of 4 distinguished points @xmath17 .",
    "we call @xmath14 the * boundary parametrisation * of @xmath18",
    ".    we will commonly refer to @xmath13 as the * arcs * of the tangle . in situations where the boundary parametrisation is irrelevant",
    ", we will simply use the notation @xmath18 .",
    "we will consider two notions of equivalence . the first one , which ignores @xmath14 ,",
    "will be given the name of tangle homeomorphism , whereas the second ( a stronger notion of equivalence ) will receive the name of tangle isomorphism .",
    "two tangles @xmath19 and @xmath20 are said to be * homeomorphic * if there exists a homeomorphism @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "two tangles @xmath23 and @xmath24 are said to be * isomorphic * if there exists a homeomorphism @xmath21 as above with the additional requirement that the following diagram commutes ( @xmath25 is understood to be the identity map ) .",
    "@xmath26 0.1 in tangles are partitioned into 3 equivalence classes , up to homeomorphism :    up to tangle homeomorphism , we have the following :    1 .",
    "a tangle @xmath18 is said to be * locally knotted * if @xmath27 an embedded 2-sphere @xmath28 in @xmath12 intersecting @xmath13 in two points and such that @xmath28 bounds a ( ball , knotted arc ) pair .",
    "a tangle @xmath18 is said to be * rational * if it is homeomorphic to the tangle @xmath29 .",
    "this is equivalent to the existence of a properly embedded disk @xmath30 in @xmath12 such that @xmath30 separates the arcs , and such that no 2-sphere intersects the arcs in the manner described in the previous paragraph .",
    "a tangle @xmath18 is said to be * prime * if it is neither locally knotted nor rational .",
    "tangles are best studied together with their two - fold covers , branched over @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the contractibility of @xmath12 ensures that these are uniquely defined once the branching set is specified , so we can speak of _ the _ two - fold cover , branched over @xmath13 , without ambiguity .",
    "when the branching set downstairs is implicit in the discussion , we will abuse terminology and will refer to the cover simply as the * double branched cover * of a tangle .",
    "the following theorem of lickorish @xcite is fundamental :    @xcite let @xmath18 be a tangle , and @xmath31 its double branched cover .",
    "then , the following holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath18 is locally knotted @xmath32 is a non - prime manifold with torus boundary .",
    "@xmath18 is rational @xmath32 is a solid torus .",
    "@xmath18 is prime @xmath33 is irreducible , @xmath34-irreducible with torus boundary .",
    "( recall that the solid torus is the only irreducible , @xmath34-reducible manifold with torus boundary . )",
    "rational tangles are classified up to isomorphism by the extended rational numbers @xmath35 , in the following sense : we define three types of homeomorphisms of tangles    1 .   @xmath36 is defined as a positive dehn half - twist about the meridian disk @xmath37 , which is the intersection of the plane @xmath38 with the standard unit 3-ball .",
    "@xmath39 is defined as a positive dehn half - twist about the latitude disk @xmath40 , which is the intersection of the plane @xmath41 with the standard unit 3-ball .",

    "adapted from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ f : twists ]    with all of this in mind , we have the following theorem of conway @xcite :    we have the following facts about rational tangles :    1 .",
    "a tangle @xmath11 is rational if and only if it can be obtained from @xmath46 by a finite sequence of horizontal twist homeomorphisms alternating with reflections taking the form @xmath47 , where the @xmath48 .",
    "setting @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , we write @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is isomorphic to @xmath53    a rational tangle of the form @xmath54 is called * integral*.    0.1 in one can define two important operations on tangles . given tangles @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath12 , we can form their * tangle sum * by connecting the @xmath56 of @xmath55 with the @xmath43 of @xmath12 via a trivial arc . similarly",
    ", one connects the @xmath44 of @xmath55 with the @xmath57 of @xmath12 .",
    "the result is ( often ) a tangle , which we denote by @xmath58 . also , given a tangle @xmath55 , one can form its * numerator closure * by connecting the northern arcs via a trivial arc , and the southern arcs in the same fashion .",
    "the result , @xmath59 , is a topological pair @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is some knot or link .",
    "these constructions are schematised in figure 7 .",
    "( left ) and @xmath59 ( right ) . ]",
    "given rational tangles @xmath62 , we define the * montesinos tangle * @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the double branched cover @xmath63 is a seifert fibered space over the disk with exceptional fibers of multiplicities @xmath65 .",
    "we can now formulate the tangle model .",
    "we model the synaptosome as a ball , which represents the region occupied by the 4 protein molecules , with a pair of properly embedded arcs , each arc representing a double stranded segment of dna .",
    "these form a tangle which we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "the complement of this tangle in @xmath66 , together with the dna outside the synaptosome , form a tangle which we denote by @xmath67 .",
    "the entire dna segment can then be represented as the numerator closure @xmath68 .",
    "we model the action of the recombinase as replacing the tangle @xmath0 by another tangle @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , one round of site - specific recombination can be described by the pair of * tangle equations *    @xmath69 @xmath70    for some knots @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend these to @xmath73 rounds of processive recombination . at the @xmath74th recombination step ( @xmath75 ) , we think of recombination as replacing the tangle @xmath76 with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is understood to be @xmath79 .",
    "hence , we have    @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82    the purpose of the model is then to determine the tangles @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath67 , given the knot type of the @xmath83 .",
    "usually @xmath84 , that is , the initial dna is taken to be unknotted .    0.1 in following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", we remark that experimental evidence seems to indicate that hin behaves in a more complex way , that of a 3-string tangle ( see figure [ inve ] ) .",
    "these objects are still not well understood , although there has been recent progress - e.g. see the work of cabrera - ibarra @xcite and darcy _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists biological evidence pointing to the fact that the enhancer sequence does not play an active role in the recombination process @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to perform an isotopy that removes it from the region modelling the invertasome , justifying the treatment of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as 2-string tangles .    0.1 in solving tangle equations in full generality is a very hard problem .",
    "fortunately , the knots usually observed in dna recombination experiments are 4-plats ( also known as 2-bridge knots ) , and this makes the problem more tractable . given enough reaction steps , it is often possible to uniquely determine @xmath67 and @xmath1 .    0.1 in the strategy for solving tangle equations is the following : one uses the information on knot types to argue that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are rational tangles .",
    "this means that their double branched covers are solid tori .",
    "therefore , we convert the tangle analysis into a dehn surgery problem .",
    "that is , we can think of attaching a solid torus @xmath85 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) to @xmath86 . here",
    ", @xmath87 denotes the double branched cover map .",
    "then , results on dehn surgery are applied to ( hopefully ) conclude that @xmath88 must be a solid torus , implying that @xmath67 is a rational tangle . a computation , as described in @xcite , then yields the tangle solutions .      in the light of the results of heichman s experiment , we propose the following tangle equations for processive hin recombination on mutated sites    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92    here , we have switched to the 2-bridge notation of schubert .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 denotes the unknot , @xmath94 denotes the trefoil knot , and @xmath95 denotes the @xmath10 knot .",
    "@xmath61 is a 7-crossing knot , and its knot will be determined as a corollary of our results .",
    "the faintness of the line in the agarose gel corresponding to 7 crossing knots ( see @xcite ) supports the suggestion that @xmath61 is the product of 3 rounds of recombination , since one should expect a dramatic decrease in the density of products as the number of recombination rounds increases .    0.1 in",
    "as stated in the previous section , we will also be interested in the @xmath96 case , which we postulate arises from distributive recombination . to capture the essence of this phenomenon ,",
    "we propose the following tangle equations    @xmath97    @xmath98    notice that @xmath99 is not the same as @xmath67 .",
    "these are two different systems , which must be treated separately .",
    "nevertheless , the information on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is crucial for the analysis , and it is part of the motivation for considering the first system .    0.1 in    in the next section , we tackle the equations for distributive recombination in a much more general form , namely    @xmath100    @xmath101    where the @xmath83 are 4-plats , and @xmath102 are rational .",
    "we postpone the solution of equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) until section 4 , where we also solve equations ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) as a consequence of the work in section 3 .",
    "our goal in this section is to give results on the classification of tangles @xmath67 which arise as solutions to the tangle equations presented below :    @xmath103 @xmath104    where the @xmath83 are 4-plats , and @xmath102 are rational . @xmath105 and @xmath106 are both assumed to be nontrivial . 0.1 in    * note :",
    "* @xmath67 can not be a rational tangle , since the sum of two rational tangles gives a 4-plat .",
    "so we consider @xmath67 to be either locally knotted or prime .",

    "we begin by noting that , since ( ball , knotted arc ) pairs persist upon tangle summation , @xmath107 or @xmath108 for locally knotted solutions to occur .",
    "if that is the case ( @xmath107 , say ) , we can excise the common ( ball , knotted arc ) pairs in both equations and we are thus reduced to    @xmath109 @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the unknot .",
    "@xmath112 is a tangle from which a ( ball , knotted arc ) pair has been excised .",
    "now , we can interpret our tangle equations as dehn surgery on a strongly invertible knot @xmath61 in @xmath66 , the core of the solid torus given by @xmath85 .",
    "our notation for dehn surgery on a manifold @xmath88 with a torus boundary component , along a slope @xmath113 , is @xmath114 . if @xmath115 then taking double branched covers gives    @xmath116 @xmath117    where @xmath118 are slopes ( simple closed curves up to isotopy ) in @xmath119 .",
    "note that @xmath112 is either rational or prime .",
    "we would like to conclude that @xmath120 is a solid torus ( and hence @xmath112 is rational ) , but this is not always true .",
    "there are numerous examples of nontrivial strongly invertible knots having lens space surgeries . following a procedure explored by bleiler @xcite",
    ", we can construct , given a strongly invertible projection of a knot possessing a lens space surgery , examples of prime tangles having rational tangle attachments yielding 4-plats .",
    "the reader is referred to bleiler s work @xcite and to gordon @xcite for details on this construction .",
    "0.1 in recent results of kronheimer _ et al _ @xcite show the following : if @xmath121 , then the only non - trivial knot which possesses a @xmath122 surgery is the trefoil .",
    "we note that site - specific recombination usually produces 2-bridge knots of low complexity ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this , together with a complete knowledge of surgeries on torus knots as given by moser @xcite and the remarks in the preceding paragraph , can help one enumerate locally knotted solutions to the tangle equations ( [ tng1 ] ) and ( [ tng2 ] ) for the case @xmath121 .",
    "whereas it would be impractical to explicitly formulate a classification theorem , individual cases can be treated with relative ease , and the details are left to the reader .      to classify prime tangle solutions we use two different strategies depending on the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the * distance * between two rational tangles @xmath124 and @xmath125 is defined as @xmath126 .",

    "thus , for @xmath142 , @xmath141 bounds a disk , and for @xmath143 , @xmath144 bounds a disk .",
    "thus , the distance between the fillings is just the geometric intersection number of these two curves , and the result follows .    from now on , we will treat the cases @xmath145 and @xmath146 separately .      to begin",

    "@xmath171 is the result of performing dehn filling on @xmath156 along a slope @xmath164 in @xmath157 .",
    "this filling always extends the fibration unless @xmath164 is isotopic to a regular fiber ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now we must distinguish two subcases : if both @xmath172 , then @xmath173 .",
    "this clearly does not admit a seifert fibration .",
    "this implies that @xmath164 is the unique slope that destroys the fibration , and so @xmath174 extends such a fibration .",
    "this implies ( see @xcite ) that the orbit surface of @xmath174 is either a torus or a nonorientable surface of genus two .",
    "this is impossible , since lens spaces can only fiber over @xmath152 or @xmath175 ( here we are taking @xmath176 as a lens space ) .",
    "if at least one of @xmath177 is not equal to zero , then @xmath156 either fibers over the disk with two exceptional fibers ( @xmath156 can not be a solid torus ) or over @xmath175 with one exceptional fiber . in either case , attaching a solid torus as determined by @xmath113 must add a regular fiber in order for us to obtain a lens space .",
    "notice that once again @xmath164 destroys the fibration , so it must be isotopic to a fiber @xmath2 on @xmath157 .",
    "choosing a crossing curve @xmath99 for @xmath157 and denoting a regular fiber by @xmath2 , we must have that @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , whence @xmath168 .",

    "if the latter holds , notice that there is an alternative fibering over the disk with two exceptional fibers , and hence this reduces to the previous situation , so we are finished .",
    "now , we show that @xmath88 is atoroidal .",
    "first , note that @xmath88 can not contain non - separating tori , for these would remain non - separating after dehn filling , contradicting the fact that all tori in lens spaces are separating .",
    "next , we appeal to the following result , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "this is a preliminary lemma in the proof of the jsj decomposition theorem .",
    "the result , we believe , is due to kneser .",
    "[ chop]let @xmath156 be irreducible , compact and connected .",
    "then , there exists a finite disjoint collection of tori @xmath133 such that each component of @xmath184 is atoroidal .    since all tori in @xmath88 are separating , the operation described above breaks @xmath88 into a disconnected collection of atoroidal manifolds .",
    "these are clearly , irreducible , @xmath34-irreducible .",
    "since all boundary components are tori , each piece is either a small sfs or simple , as remarked before propoposition [ prro ] .    in order to aid our discussion ,",
    "let us define the following :    a * splitting graph of @xmath88 along @xmath133 * is a graph @xmath185 whose edges are the essential tori in @xmath133 , and the vertices are connected pieces of the decomposition .",
    "two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if some incompressible torus in @xmath133 separates their corresponding components , and @xmath133 lies in both components .",
    "the splitting graph for @xmath88 is a tree .",
    "recall that a finite connected graph is a tree if and only if removing any edge disconnects it . that @xmath185 is connected follows from the fact that @xmath88 is connected",
    "since all of our tori are separating , deleting one of them will disconnect @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the splitting graph for this disconnected manifold is a disconnected graph , and the result follows .",
    "now , we let the vertex corresponding to the connected component that contains @xmath186 be the root of the splitting tree , and we can begin the analysis . recall that in a tree , the concept of height of edges and vertices is well defined , once a root is chosen .",

    "an edge @xmath191 will be labelled similarly .",
    "we will abuse notation and identify vertices with pieces of the decomposition and edges with essential tori .    0.1 in note that if @xmath185 consists of a single vertex , there is nothing to prove : in this case",
    ", @xmath88 is atoroidal , and hence simple , by previous discussions .",
    "so we may assume that the set of edges is nonempty .",
    "we can now state our first result .",
    "[ atoroidal]@xmath192 is a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber .",
    "as remarked above proposition [ prro ] , @xmath192 is either simple or a small sfs .",
    "let us deal with the simple case first .",
    "_ case 1 : _",
    "suppose @xmath192 is simple .",
    "we may assume that @xmath192 has more than one boundary component : these are @xmath186 and @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is some positive integer .",
    "now , perform the @xmath113 and @xmath164 fillings along @xmath186 , and denote the manifolds obtained by @xmath113 and @xmath164 filling on @xmath192 as @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "we know that @xmath122 and @xmath197 are atoroidal , and hence all the @xmath198 must compress in @xmath122 and @xmath197 .",
    "we claim that at least one of the @xmath198 must compress in @xmath195 , and the same for @xmath196 .",
    "let us prove the claim : let @xmath199 be a compressing disk for @xmath200 in @xmath122 . since @xmath200 separates @xmath88 , @xmath201 is either contained in the component that contains @xmath186 or in the other component .",
    "if @xmath201 is in this other component , that means that @xmath200 compresses in @xmath88 , contradicting the fact that it is essential .",
    "thus we may assume @xmath199 is in the component which contains @xmath202 , but not necessarily in @xmath195 .",
    "this will happen if and only if @xmath199 intersects some of the @xmath198 .",
    "so suppose @xmath199 intersects some of the other @xmath203 .",
    "this intersection is a finite collection of loops .",
    "let @xmath204 be an innermost loop .",
    "we know that @xmath204 must then bound a disk @xmath205 , and the boundary of this disk intersects , say , @xmath206 .",
    "notice that this disk does nt intersect any other of the @xmath198 .",
    "now , we apply an innermost loop argument : if this disk is inessential in @xmath206 , we may delete its interior from @xmath206 , push @xmath207 away from @xmath206 , and glue back another disk disjoint from @xmath206 , thus reducing the number of intersections .",
    "hence , we can assume that @xmath204 is an essential loop in @xmath206 which bounds a disk .",
    "this is a compression disk for @xmath206 .",
    "repeating the argument at the start of the claim , we have that this disk is contained in the component to which @xmath186 belongs .",
    "since @xmath208 is taken not to intersect any of the other @xmath198 , we have constructed a compressing disk for @xmath206 in @xmath195 .",
    "exactly the same argument goes for @xmath196 , and the claim is proved .",
    "now , we have a pair of fillings @xmath113 and @xmath164 for a simple manifold @xmath192 such that @xmath209 and such that @xmath195 and @xmath196 are @xmath34-reducible .",
    "this contradicts results of wu ( theorem 1 of @xcite ) , and so @xmath192 can not be simple .    _ case 2 : _",
    "@xmath192 is a small sfs .",
    "we ve already remarked that @xmath192 has at leat two boundary components .",
    "going through the list of small sfs ( see @xcite ) , we find that the only possibilities are a sfs over the pair of pants with no exceptional fibers , or a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber",

    "suppose @xmath192 is a sfs over the pair of pants .",
    "we are given two different dehn fillings on @xmath192 .",
    "a filling with slope @xmath113 `` destroys '' the fibration if and only if @xmath113 is attached to a curve homologous to a fiber .",
    "since we have two fillings with different slopes , at least one of them will  respect \" the seifert fibration and wlog we see that @xmath195 is a sfs over the annulus .",
    "we can now apply the same reasoning as in the simple case and deduce that at least one of the boundary components will compress in @xmath195 .",
    "now , it is known that an irreducible manifold with a compressible torus boundary component is a solid torus .",
    "thus , @xmath195 is a solid torus , and this is clearly a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we must remark at this point that the case where @xmath192 is a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber can occur : we can regard a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber as the result of removing the neighborhood of a @xmath210 torus knot from a solid torus @xmath183 , where this torus knot lies on the boundary of a torus concentric to @xmath211 .",
    "@xmath212 is the invariant of the exceptional fiber .",
    "denote this space by @xmath213 ( this is often known as a cable space ) .",
    "performing dehn filling on a boundary component yields a seifert fibered space with at most two exceptional fibers for all slopes except one .",
    "standard facts about seifert fibered spaces can then be used to determine exactly when this fibration is that of a solid torus ( that is , when no exceptional fibers are added ) .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "0.1 in it might look that we can not make any further progress with our analysis at this stage .",
    "however , we can get around the difficulties as follows : we claim that @xmath195 and @xmath196 are both solid tori .",
    "thus , we can think of @xmath195 and @xmath196 as inducing two dehn fillings on @xmath214 , which we will denote by @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "if we can show that the distance between these fillings is not 1 , we can apply proposition [ atoroidal ] inductively to show the tree is linear , with a terminal node @xmath217 which is a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber and a pair of induced fillings on @xmath217 at distance greater than 1 .",
    "@xmath195 and @xmath196 are solid tori .    we know that at least one of the fillings will extend the seifert fibration , so , wlog , assume that @xmath195 is a sfs .",
    "in particular , it is irreducible .",
    "exactly the same argument as for the pair of pants implies that @xmath195 is @xmath34-reducible , and hence a solid torus .",
    "now , if @xmath196 also respects the fibration , there is nothing to prove .",
    "so assume that the fibration does not extend to @xmath196 .",
    "choose a pair of curves @xmath2 , @xmath99 on the component @xmath133 of @xmath218 where the filling takes place .",
    "here , @xmath2 is a fiber , and @xmath99 is a crossing curve . these form a basis for @xmath219 ( see @xcite for details on crossing curves ) .",
    "thus , in the @xmath113 filling , a meridian gets glued to a curve @xmath220 . in the @xmath164 filling ,",
    "a meridian gets glued to @xmath2 .",
    "however , we showed before that @xmath195 is a solid torus , and this can not fiber with two exceptional fibers .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath192 has one exceptional fiber , implies that the @xmath113 filling adds a regular fiber , and hence @xmath221 .",
    "we thus have that @xmath222 .",
    "this contradicts @xmath155 , and hence @xmath196 must be a solid torus as well .",
    "thus , the claim is proved .    0.1 in we must now compute the distance between these fillings @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "essentially , this is figuring out which slopes on @xmath223 , @xmath224 bound disks .",
    "we use the following notation : let @xmath225 be a simple closed curve in a solid torus @xmath183 which does not lie inside a ball , and let @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is a regular open neighborhood of @xmath225 .",
    "we denote by @xmath228 the result of performing @xmath229 dehn surgery on @xmath230 on the boundary component created by removing @xmath227 .",

    "we can now use this to prove :    @xmath236 .",
    "let @xmath237 , @xmath238 , with @xmath113 , @xmath164 as before .",
    "then the previous proposition allows us to express @xmath239 and @xmath240 in terms of coordinates on @xmath211 .",
    "we obtain that a meridian in @xmath195 is a @xmath241 curve .",
    "similarly , a meridian in @xmath196 is a @xmath242 curve .",
    "hence , @xmath243 .",
    "since in the case of cabling spaces @xmath244 , the result follows .",
    "this allows us to complete our main argument :    [ mauro ] @xmath88 is atoroidal .    we ve shown that @xmath192 is a sfs over the annulus , and that @xmath195 and @xmath196 are solid tori .",
    "we can now pass the analysis to @xmath214 , and so we have two dehn fillings @xmath215 and @xmath216 . by the previous proposition , @xmath245 .",
    "we can now apply the argument of proposition [ atoroidal ] and conclude that @xmath214 is a sfs over the annulus with at most one exceptional fiber . carrying out this procedure",
    "inductively we eventually reach the terminal node @xmath217 of our tree .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath217 can not be simple , and it must therefore be a sfs over the disk with at most two exceptional fibers .",
    "but this is the situation of proposition [ prro ] : @xmath217 can not be a sfs .",

    "we have dehn fillings @xmath128 yielding a lens space and @xmath129 yielding a reducible manifold .",
    "this implies that @xmath246 , by theorem [ boy ] .",
    "the result follows .      here , the dehn filling techniques used above break down , and in fact the bounds obtained are best possible , in the sense that there are examples of reducible and cyclic fillings at distance one .",
    "the class of prime tangles ( respectively irreducible , @xmath34-irreducible manifolds ) is too large for one to hope for a complete solution to the problem .",

    "[ ti]given that @xmath312 , @xmath293 , the following are the complete tangle solutions for @xmath99 to the equations :    @xmath315 @xmath316    1 .",
    "* rational tangles : * there are no rational tangle solutions .",
    "* prime tangles : * there are no prime tangle solutions .",
    "locally knotted solutions : * the only 4 possible solutions for @xmath99 are displayed in figure [ knotty ] .    .",
    "note that only a and b are consistent with experimental evidence . ]",
    "[ final ]    we treat each case separately :    @xmath325 this is a straightforward observation , already remarked in section 4 .",
    "@xmath326 this follows from corollary [ coroo ] .",
    "@xmath327 we use the procedure described at the beginning of section 4.1 to obtain a one - to - one correspondence between locally knotted solutions and solutions to the equations obtained by excising a common knotted ( ball , arc ) pair .",
    "@xmath328 @xmath329    here , @xmath330 is either rational or prime .",
    "suppose @xmath330 is prime .",
    "then , its double branched cover is a knot complement @xmath331 .",
    "suppose @xmath61 is not a torus knot ( _ i.e. _ @xmath332 is not a sfs ) .",
    "by lemma [ lil ] , we can obtain @xmath285 by performing @xmath333 surgery on @xmath61 , contradicting the cyclic surgery theorem ( which asserts that the surgery must be integral ) .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath61 is a torus knot .",
    "applying exactly the same argument as in proposition [ same ] , we conclude that @xmath61 is the unknot , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath330 is rational .",
    "it is now a routine matter to enumerate the possibilities for @xmath330 .",
    "let @xmath334 .",
    "applying lemma 2.1 of @xcite to both equations with @xmath312 and @xmath293 we get @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "solving gives the rational numbers @xmath337 .",
    "reintroducing the excised trefoils , we obtain the desired locally knotted solutions .",
    "the results suggest that , with the exception of solutions c and d in figure [ knotty ] , the action of hin during distributive recombination is essentially identical to that of processive recombination . in particular , this seems to indicate the formation of composite knots occurs as hin traps a dna molecule which has already undergone one round of recombination , with the existing dna knot being localised outside of the invertasome .",
    "the invertasome maintains a configuration that is identical to the processive recombination steps .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that hin is a highly restrictive protein , and the invertasome tends to be productive only under very special conditions @xcite .",
    "these results are what one would naturally expect of distributive recombination yielding composite knots",
    ".    the undesired solutions illustrated in figures [ knotty]c and d do not seem to conform to any previously reported biological mechanism @xcite .",
    "in particular , they induce an antiparallel alignment of the inverted crossover sites . however , as discussed in section 2 , the dna segments involved in the invertasome are only several dozen bp long .",
    "this short length makes it highly unlikely a compensating supercoil could be introduced within the invertasome to give the required parallel alignment of the inverted crossover sites .",
    "we have successfully extended the tangle model to treat equations involving composite knots in most cases . to do this , we first built on results on exceptional dehn fillings at maximal distance .",
    "we then showed that , for any prime tangle , there are no rational tangle attachments of distance greater than one that first yield a 4-plat and then a connected sum of 4-plats .",
    "next , we applied the tangle model to describe the rational tangle solution to processive hin recombination on mutated sites .",
    "finally , this was combined with our surgery results to classify all tangle solutions arising from distributive recombination mediated by hin ( theorem [ ti ] ) .",
    "our work confirms the biologically predicted configuration for the invertasome ( modulo one undesired solution , that can be excluded on biological grounds ) .",
    "further , the outside dna attains a configuration that is the expected one , with localised knotted arcs trapped outside the invertasome , as shown in figure [ knotty ] .",
    "we emphasize that although we have illustrated this extended tangle model with the hin recombinase , that the lens space connect sum surgery restrictions , as developed in section 4 , are completely general .",
    "thus , these can be applied to a variety of site - specific recombination systems where composite knots arise as a result of distributive recombination . in particular ,",
    "the gin recombinase has been known to yield composite knots @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it would be useful to obtain electron micrograph images of reaction products of the form @xmath338 , which we predict would occur as the result of an additional round of recombination in our model .",
    "the existence of these products would eliminate solutions c and d in theorem [ ti ] , as discussed in the previous section .    as remarked in section 3 ,",
    "experiments indicate the hin invertasome behaves as a 3-string tangle .",
    "one other possible avenue of research would therefore be to model hin as a 3-string tangle .",
    "darcy , luecke and vazquez @xcite and cabrera ibarra @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have published some results in this direction . in particular",
    ", cabrera ibarra gives results on the classification of 3-string tangle solutions to processive recombination by gin , a protein very similar to hin .",
    "we plan to extend these results to the setting of distributive recombination",
    ".    finally , the most natural direction in which to extend our results would be to obtain more information on the @xmath146 case .",
    "this could be then be applied to a variety of site - specific recombination systems , including distributive recombination of hin on standard sites @xcite , and processive followed by distributive recombination of gin on directly repeated sites @xcite , @xcite . additionally , classifying such surgeries at distance one would be an interesting mathematical problem on its own .",
