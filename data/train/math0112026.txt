    "in particular , a coboundary will simply count the number of colorings of a knot or knotted surface by the quandle @xmath6 .",
    "two important topological applications have been obtained using the cocycle invariants .",
    "* the @xmath0-twist spun trefoil @xmath29 and its orientation - reversed counterpart @xmath244 have shown to have distinct cocycle invariants using a cocycle in @xmath245 , providing a proof that @xmath29 is non - invertible @xcite .",
    "+ the higher genus surfaces obtained from @xmath29 by adding arbitrary number of trivial @xmath11-handles are also non - invertible , since such handle additions do not alter the cocycle invariant .",
    "+ we note , again , that this result in higher genus cases is not immediately obtained from @xcite , although higher genus generalizations of the farber - levine pairing @xcite can be used . *",
    "the projection of the @xmath0-twist spun trefoil was shown to have at least four triple points @xcite .",
    "+ the same cocycle group @xmath245 , but a different cocycle found in @xcite was used .",
    "in this section , we describe @xmath0-dimensional quandle homology classes as cobordism classes of quandle colored virtual knot diagrams .",
    "see @xcite for more general geometric descriptions of homology classes .",
    "consider an untwisted quandle homology class of a quandle @xmath6 , and represent the class by @xmath246 .",
    "write @xmath247 as a sum of @xmath0-chains @xmath248 where @xmath249 . for each @xmath250 with @xmath251 , consider a positive crossing diagram in which the over - arc is colored @xmath252 and the under - arc away from which the normal to the over arc points is colored @xmath253 . similarly , when @xmath254 we consider a negative crossing of the same form .",
    "the boundary of the chain is @xmath255 which is the difference in the colors on the under - arcs . since @xmath247 is a cycle these boundary terms cancel over the sum of the crossings .",
    "thus to represent the @xmath0-cycle , we take a disjoint union of colored crossings , and join the end - point arcs together when they have the correct orientation and the same color .",
    "the arcs are joined together formally , and the joining need not occur on a planar diagram , obtaining a colored `` virtual knot diagram . ''",
    "virtual knots have been popularized by l.h .",
    "kauffman who has found , for example , that the diagram in fig .",

    "the unshaded crossings between bands can be regarded as virtual crossings .",
    "these bands connecting shaded squares correspond to identifying matching boundaries in the above construction .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "* there is a one - to - one correspondence @xcite between ( 1 ) quandle colored virtual knot diagrams modulo the virtual reidemeister moves and colored cobordisms , and ( 2 ) @xmath0-dimensional quandle homology classes .",
    "* this geometric representations were used to estimate the rank of rack homology groups in @xcite for some racks and quandles . * this",
    "was also used to show that a certain long exact sequence splits @xcite at low dimensions , as mentioned in section  [ quanss ] . * the @xmath0-dimensional regions near crossings in classical diagrams",
    "can also be colored to represent @xmath3-cycles .",
    "such colorings were used in @xcite to give an alternate proof that left- and right handed trefoils are not equivalent . *",
    "the cocycle invariants can be interpreted as a formal sum of the kronecker product between a fixed cocycle and such cycles constructed above represented by colored diagrams .",
    "such an interpretation was used in @xcite to evaluate the cocycle invariants .",
    "* twisted cycles have a similar interpretation , but the consistency of alexander numbering requires care . * the untwisted homology group @xmath261 is trivial .",
    "thus the cycle @xmath262 is a boundary .",
    "meanwhile , the fundamental quandle @xcite of the virtual knot in fig .  [ ssvsv0 ] can be computed to be @xmath130 .",
    "thus we have the interesting situtation in which a knot , with any coloring by its fundamental quandle elements , is null - homologous in the @xmath0-dimensional cycle group of its fundamental quandle .",

    "this was proven using similar techniques in @xcite .",
    "recently , satoh and shima @xcite have shown that any diagram for the @xmath0-twist spun trefoil has at least 4 triple points using a @xmath3-cocycle in @xmath272 discovered by mochizuki @xcite .",

    "were discovered by calculations first , and then drinfeld @xcite developed a theory of quantum groups whose representations gave rise to r - matrices .",
    "this construction is seen as an obstruction to co - commutativity satisfying the next order ( the yang - baxter ) relation , or , deformation theory of an algebraic structure giving rise to a solution to a higher order relation .",
