    "in july 2012 , a higgs - like resonance with mass @xmath4 125 gev has been caught by the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite .",
    "so far , all the measurements of the discovered new particle@xcite are well compatible with the scalar boson predicted by the standard model(sm)@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the sm can not be the final theory of nature .",
    "theoretically , successful explanation of some problems , such as the hierarchy problem , requires new physics beyond the sm near the tev scale .",
    "experimentally , the solid evidence for neutrino oscillation is one of the firm hints for new physics .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm is that the sm gauge groups are augmented by a @xmath0 symmetry , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the baryon number and lepton number respectively .",
    "the @xmath7 gauge symmetry can explain the presence of three right - handed neutrinos and provide a natural framework for the seesaw mechanism@xcite . in addiction",
    ", it s worth noting that @xmath7 symmetry breaking takes place at the tev scale , hence giving rise to new and interesting tev scale phenomenology .",
    "concerning the probe of new physics through the higgs boson , the yukawa couplings play an important role in probing the new physics .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest particle discovered and owns the strongest yukawa coupling .",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling is speculated to be sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism and new physics .",
    "the @xmath8 production process is a golden channel for directly probing the top yukawa coupling , however , this process can not provide the information on the relative sign between the coupling of the higgs to fermions and to vector bosons . as a beneficial supplement , the @xmath9 production process can bring a unique possibility@xcite and many relevant works have been carried out@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model predicts heavy neutrinos , a tev scale extra neutral gauge boson and an additional heavy neutral higgs , which makes the model phenomenologically rich .",
    "the heavy higgs state mixes with the sm higgs boson so that some higgs couplings are modified and this effect can also influence the process of single top and higgs associated production . besides , the process of single top and heavy higgs associated production deserves attention , which is equally important for understanding the ewsb and probing new physics . by performing the detailed analysis on this process may provide a good opportunity to probe the @xmath0 model signal .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we review the @xmath0 model related to our work . in sec.iii",
    "we first calculate the production cross sections of the single top and @xmath10 associated production at the lhc , then explore the observability of @xmath11-channel process @xmath2 through @xmath12 by performing a parton - level simulation .",
    "finally , we make a summary in sec.iv .",
    "the minimal @xmath7 extension of the sm @xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath13 with the classical conformal symmetry . under this gauge symmetry ,",
    "the invariance of the lagrangian implies the existence of a new gauge boson . in order to make the model free from all the gauge and gravitational anomalies , three generations of right - handed neutrinos",
    "are necessarily introduced .    in this model",
    ", the most general gauge - invariant and renormalisable scalar lagrangian can be expressed as @xmath14 with the scalar potential given by @xmath15    from the mass terms in the scalar potential , the mass matrix between the two higgs bosons in the basis @xmath16 can be given by @xmath17 the mass eigenstates are related via the mixing matrix @xmath18 where the mixing angle @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) satisfies @xmath21 the masses of the physical higgs bosons @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are light sm - like and heavy higgs bosons , respectively .    to complete the discussion on the lagrangian , we write down the yukawa term , which in addition to the sm terms has interactions involving the right - handed neutrinos @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 runs from 1@xmath313 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath32 field breaks the @xmath7 symmetry and generates the majorana masses for the right handed neutrinos and the dirac masses for the light neutrinos .    in terms of the mixing angle @xmath19",
    ", the couplings of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the fermions and gauge bosons can be expressed as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the sm fermions , @xmath35 with @xmath36 is the usual weinberg angle .",
    "for the single top and higgs associated production , the three processes of interest are characterized by the virtuality of the @xmath37 boson in the process@xcite : ( i ) @xmath11-channel , where the @xmath37 is spacelike ; ( ii ) @xmath38-channel , where the @xmath37 is timelike ; ( iii ) @xmath37-associated production channel , where there is emission of a real @xmath37 boson . in the @xmath0 model , the lowest - order feynman diagrams of the @xmath11-channel process @xmath39 are shown in fig.[thjbl ] , the @xmath38-channel process @xmath40 are shown in fig.[thbbl ] and the @xmath37-associated production channel process @xmath41 are shown in fig.[thwbl ] .",
    "we can see that the feynman diagrams for these processes are the same as the corresponding sm processes .",
    "moreover , the conjugate processes where @xmath11 is replaced by @xmath42 have been included in our calculations .",
    "we compute the cross sections by using @xmath43@xcite with the parton distribution function cteq6l @xcite , and set the renormalization scale @xmath44 and factorization scale @xmath45 to be @xmath46 .",
    "the sm input parameters are taken as follows @xcite : @xmath47    in our calculations , the relevant @xmath0 model parameters are the mixing parameter @xmath19 and the heavy higgs mass @xmath48 . considering the constraints in refs.@xcite , we choose the parameter space as follows : @xmath49 , @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52 .      in fig.[th1 ] , we show the production cross sections of the processes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 at the 8 and 14 tev lhc in the @xmath0 model , respectively . for clarity , we marked the corresponding sm process cross sections on the figures .",
    "we can see that the cross sections in the @xmath0 model decrease with increasing @xmath57 . besides , the behavior of these three processes are similar for the 8 tev and 14 tev .",
    "this is easy to understand because there are the same change factor @xmath58 in the light higgs @xmath25 couplings in eq.([int ] ) so that the production cross sections are suppressed by @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 , the mixing between the light higgs @xmath25 and the heavy higgs @xmath26 will decouple so that the cross sections go back to the sm values .      in figs.([th2cross8]-[th2cross14 ] ) , we show the production cross sections of the processes @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 at the 8 and 14 tev lhc in the @xmath0 model , respectively . in order to see the influence of the heavy higgs mass @xmath48 on the production cross sections , we take @xmath66 as example .",
    "we can see that the cross sections increase with increasing @xmath57 , which is because the heavy higgs @xmath26 couplings in eq.([int ] ) are proportional to @xmath57 so that the cross sections are proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath11-channel process dominates amongst these three production modes at the lhc , so we will explore the observability through the @xmath11-channel @xmath62 at 14 tev lhc in the following section .",
    "the three most dominant decay modes of the heavy higgs @xmath26 are @xmath68 and @xmath69@xcite .",
    "though the branching fraction of @xmath70 is smaller than the branching fractions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the @xmath69 signal is much easier to separate from sm backgrounds . for the @xmath69 decay modes ,",
    "the leptonic decay mode of @xmath69 offer the cleanest possible signatures though the di - jet and semi - leptonic decay modes of @xmath69 are larger .",
    "this leptonic decay mode has been studied in the heavy higgs production at the lhc and it found that a heavy higgs boson of mass smaller than 500 gev can be discovered at the lhc with high - luminosity ( hl - lhc)@xcite . in our work , we concentrate on the channel @xmath73 as shown in fig.[decay ] , where @xmath26 decays to two @xmath74 bosons and the two @xmath74 bosons subsequently decay to four leptons . the signal is characterised by @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the light jets and @xmath77 .",
    "the largest background for this process comes from the @xmath78 production mode that will generate the same final state .",
    "we generate the signal and background events with with @xcite and perform the parton shower and the fast detector simulations with @xcite and @xcite . to simulate @xmath79-tagging , we take moderate single @xmath79-tagging efficiency @xmath80 for @xmath79-jet in the final state .",
    "follow the analysis on @xmath8 signature by atlas and cms collaborations@xcite at the lhc run - i , the events are selected to satisfy the criteria as follows : @xmath81    [ 1 ] > + m#1     c0.3 cm c0.3 cm c0.cm |c2cm|c2cm|c2cm|",
    "c2 cm & & & & + & & & & & & + & & & & & 3000fb@xmath82 & + & & 34.3&103.9&1.84&0.33 + & & 15.6 & 50.2&1.20&0.31 + & & 11.3&19.5&1.40&0.58 + & & 2.97&1.04&1.60&2.86 +    due to the small signal cross section , this process has a low signal - to - background ratio @xmath83 at the lhc . in this case",
    ", we will focus on enhancing the systematic significance @xmath84 . considering the transverse momentum of the leptons",
    "have little effect on the signal - to - background ratio and the systematic significance , we do nt use them as selection cuts here .",
    "after analysis , we will adopt the following two cuts , the relevant normalized distributions of the kinematic variables for @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 with respect to the background are shown in fig.[th2 ] .",
    "firstly , we impose the cut @xmath87 gev to separate signal from background , where @xmath88 is the total transverse hadronic energy .",
    "this cut can improve both the signal - to - background ratio @xmath83 and the systematic significance @xmath84 .",
    "after that , we apply the invariant mass of the four lepton system to further isolate the signal and let @xmath89 lie in the range @xmath90 gev .",
    "we can see that the signal - to - background ratio @xmath83 is improved and the systematic significance @xmath84 is enhanced obviously .",
    "the cut - flow cross sections of the signal and background for 14 tev lhc are summarized in table.[cutflow ] .",
    "after all cuts above , we can see that the systematic significance @xmath84 is substantially improved . for",
    "the hl - lhc with a final integrated luminosity of @xmath91fb@xmath82 , the signal - to - background ratio @xmath83 can reach 1.6@xmath92 and systematic significance @xmath84 can reach 2.86 for @xmath93 gev , @xmath86 .",
    "unfortunatel , we can see that the number of signal events is very small because of the small leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath74 boson , which will be a trouble for detecting this signal at the lhc .",
    "in the minimal @xmath7 extension of the sm , we investigated the single top and higgs associated production at the lhc .",
    "we computed the production cross sections of the processes @xmath94 for 8 , 14 tev lhc and displayed the dependance of the cross sections on the relevant @xmath0 model parameter .",
    "moreover , we investigated the observability of process @xmath2 followed by the decays @xmath95 and @xmath96 at 14 tev lhc for @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 .",
    "we performed a simple parton - level simulation and found that it is challenging for the 14 tev lhc and future hl - lhc with the integrated luminosity @xmath97fb@xmath82 to observe the effect of the process @xmath98 through this final state .",
    "so , we have to expect a collider with higher energy and higher luminosity to probe this effect",
    ". maybe , a 100 tev proton - proton collider with integrated luminosities of 3 ab@xmath99 30ab@xmath82 can provide us a potential opportunity@xcite .",
