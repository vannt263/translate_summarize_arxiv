    "recent results in the case of cyclic covering spaces ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) suggest the existence of such a theory .",
    "having understood the cyclic case , the natural next step is to consider the branched dihedral covering spaces .",
    "these spaces have long played an important role in knot theory , dating back to reidemeister s use of the linking matrix of a knot s dihedral covering link to distinguish knots with the same alexander polynomial ( @xcite , see also _",
    "more recently they have also been used in investigations of knot concordance ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , branched dihedral covers are useful in @xmath2manifold topology : for example , it turns out that every @xmath2manifold is a @xmath2fold branched dihedral covering space over some knot ( see _ e.g. _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.11 ) ) .",

    "one first performs crossing changes to untie the knot by introducing @xmath3framed unknots along which surgery is carried out .",
    "the unknots are chosen to have linking number zero with the knot .",
    "after this step , we have a surgery presentation of the given knot as a @xmath3framed link @xmath5 lying in the complement of an unknot @xmath6 , where each component of @xmath5 has linking number zero modulo @xmath1 with @xmath6 . for the purpose of generalization",

    "we would like analogous procedures for classes of covering spaces corresponding to other groups , in particular to the dihedral groups .",
    "the key feature which permitted construction in the cyclic case was the existence of a knot ( the unknot ) which every other knot could be transformed into via surgeries in the kernel of the mod @xmath1 linking homomorphism , and whose branched cyclic cover could be constructed explicitly .    to discuss how this generalizes it s worth introducing a few definitions .    for",
