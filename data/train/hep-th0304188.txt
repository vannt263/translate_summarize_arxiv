    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite support the idea that the standard big bang phase of the expansion of the universe was preceded by inflation @xcite .",
    "recent results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite constrain the properties of proposed inflationary models tightly , but although some models are now excluded , numerous possibilities remain . a further challenge to observational cosmology",
    "is to try to hone in on a small class of viable models , even if identifying a single , correct theory of inflation may prove impracticable .",
    "all of the data collected up until now are consistent with a relatively pristine universe in which the perturbations observed today result from the amplification and distortion of a relatively featureless , gaussian spectrum of fluctuations produced by quantum effects during inflation .",
    "however , it is likely that inflation itself could have left behind other remnants  such as cosmic strings  which could actively perturb both the cmb and dark matter of the universe up to the present day .",
    "it is well - known that cosmic strings can not be wholly responsible for either the cmb temperature fluctuations or the observed clustering of galaxies @xcite ; roughly speaking , the implied limits on the cosmic string tension @xmath6 allowed by observations is @xmath7 .",
    "however , now that cosmology has entered an era in which the properties of the universe are being revealed to unprecedented precision , a natural question is to what extent the observations can allow previously unwanted ingredients , such as cosmic strings ( e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , as the precision of cosmological observations increases , we might hope to be able to distinguish among numerous presently viable models for inflation by the properties of the cosmic strings they predict .",
    "although the idea that inflationary cosmology might lead to cosmic string formation is not new @xcite , it has received new impetus from the brane world scenario suggested by superstring theory . in brane world cosmology",
    ", standard model particles and interactions correspond to open string ( brane ) modes , while the graviton , the dilaton and the radions are closed string ( bulk ) modes .",
    "thus , our 3d universe can be thought of as residing on a brane or stack of branes with three dimensions of cosmological size .",
    "these branes in turn reside in extra dimensions that are compactified .",
    "in such a model , inflation can result during the collisions of branes coalescing to form , ultimately , the brane on which we live @xcite .    in these brane inflation models ,",
    "the separations between branes in the compactified dimensions are scalar fields ( open string modes ) that can act as inflatons , with the interaction potential between spatially separated branes providing the inflaton potential .",
    "details of the brane inflation scenario depend on both qualitative and quantitative features , such as whether collisions involve a brane - antibrane pair @xcite or two branes coalescing at an angle @xcite , as well as parameters such as the sizes of the compactified dimensions @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , though , it appears easy to find models that predict adiabatic temperature and dark matter fluctuations capable of reproducing all currently available observations . a seemingly unavoidable outcome of brane inflation , though , is the production of a network of cosmic strings @xcite , whose effects on cosmological observables ranges from negligible to substantial , depending on the specific brane inflationary scenario @xcite .    although cosmic string production towards the end of inflation is possible in field theory models @xcite , the scaling properties of the cosmic string networks in brane inflationary scenarios are different than that in the familiar 3 + 1 d simulations , since intercommutation probabilities are smaller as a consequence of the existence of extra dimensions .",
    "in addition to placing constraints on the amplitude of string induced perturbations of the cmb , we show that the results place limits on @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is the string tension and @xmath9 is related to the interstring distance as a fraction of the horizon .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is sensitive to the intercommutation rate of strings , however the exact relation is expected to be model - dependent .",
    "here we shall first review the essential points of brane inflation , and examine the constraints imposed by the wmap observations if we ignore the contribution from cosmic strings .",
    "these constraints allow us to delineate a range of possible cosmic string tensions .",
    "then , we assess quantitatively the extent to which cosmic strings can contribute to the cmb temperature fluctuations and power spectra of dark matter density perturbations . in this analysis , we hold properties of the background cosmological model fixed to their best fit values , as determined by wmap @xcite _ _ w__ithout cosmic strings .",
    "( a more detailed analysis that varies the background cosmology as well is under way . )",
    "although the available data favor models without cosmic strings , they may still allow , within the uncertainties , a contribution from string - induced perturbations of up to 10% .",
    "they also imply scalar perturbation indices @xmath5 which , although still consistent with a broad range of models , may be able to discriminate among them in future .",
    "we also compute the dark matter density perturbation power spectrum , and compare with observational determinations from the 2dfgrs galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of these results in terms of the string tension and efficiency with which the cosmic string network decays via intercommutation of string segments , which is reduced in a universe with extra dimensions .",
    "finally , we discuss the prospects for detecting b - mode polarization , which is expected to be a prominent signature of a cosmic string network , in view of the constraints implied by our analysis .",
    "recently , the brane world scenario suggested by superstring theory was proposed , where the standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions are open string ( brane ) modes while the graviton and the radions are closed string ( bulk ) modes .",
    "the relative brane positions ( i.e. , brane separation ) in the compactified dimensions are scalar fields that have just the right properties to act as inflatons .",
    "thus , the brane inflation scenario emerges naturally in the brane world @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the inflaton potential is due to the exchange of closed string modes between branes ; this is the dual of the one - loop partition function of the open string spectrum , a property well - studied in string theory @xcite .",
    "this interaction is of gravitational strength , resulting in a very weak ( flat ) potential , ideally tailored for inflation .",
    "the potential is essentially dictated by the attractive gravitational ( and the ramond - ramond ) interaction between branes .",
    "as the branes move towards each other , slow - roll exponential inflation takes place .",
    "this yields an almost scale - invariant power spectrum for density perturbation , except there is a slight red - tilt ( at a few percent level ) .",
    "as they reach a distance around the string scale , the inflaton potential becomes quite steep so that the slow - roll condition breaks down . at around the same time , a complex tachyon appears , so inflation ends rapidly as the tachyon rolls down its potential . in effect",
    ", inflation ends when the branes collide , heating the universe to start the standard big bang phase of cosmological expansion .",
    "this brane inflationary scenario may be realized in a number of ways @xcite .",
    "the scenario is simplest when the radion and the dilaton ( bulk ) modes are assumed to be stabilized by some unknown non - perturbative bulk dynamics at the onset of inflation .",
    "since the inflaton is a brane mode , and the inflaton potential is dictated by the brane mode spectrum , it is reasonable to assume that the inflaton potential is insensitive to the details of the bulk dynamics .",
    "coupling of the tachyon to inflaton and standard model fields can allow efficient heating of the universe if certain conditions on the coupling of the tachyon to standard model particles are met @xcite . as the tachyon rolls down its potential , besides heating the universe , the vacuum energy also goes to the production of defects , in particular , cosmic strings .",
    "the effect of the resulting cosmic string network may be negligible or rather substantial , depending on the particular brane inflationary scenario @xcite .",
    "however , in all cases , we expect the density perturbation power spectrum in cmb to be dominated by the adiabatic fluctuations arising from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton during brane inflation , not by the nonadiabatic contributions from cosmic strings .",
    "however , the contribution to the density perturbation power spectrum in cmb coming from the cosmic string network may be large enough to be observable .",
    "we devote this section to a review of the implications of brane inflation . for a broad set of models",
    ", we present results for the slow roll evolution , fluctuation spectra , string mass scale , and associated cosmic string tension .",
    "( these results follow directly from the treatments in refs . @xcite . )",
    "we consider the collision of a @xmath10 brane with a @xmath10 brane at an angle @xmath11 ; collision with a @xmath10 antibrane corresponds to @xmath12 .",

    "we will distinguish between two different potentials for the interaction between branes , depending on their separations .",
    "( see @xcite . ) for some scenarios , a fixed lattice of branes is considered to be spread throughout the compactified dimensions , with a moving brane placed inside one lattice square . at separations small",
    "compared to the lattice size of the compactification topology , the interaction is `` coulombic '' , with a potential of the form @xmath29 for a separation @xmath30 in the large compact dimensions .",
    "this potential is suitable for inflation resulting from the collision of a pair of relatively nearby branes at a small angle @xcite .",
    "when the separation is nearly equal to the lattice size , an expansion about zero displacement from the anti - podal point gives @xmath31 , where @xmath32 depends on the compactification topology .",
    "this potential is suitable for the brane - anti - brane scenario ( which corresponds to branes at angle @xmath33 ) . in the next two subsections , we summarize the inflation scenario for interbrane potentials of these two general forms .",

    "numerical simulations @xcite show that during the radiation and matter dominated eras the string network evolves according to a scaling solution , which on sufficiently large scales can be described by two length scales .",
    "the first scale , @xmath110 , is the coherence length of strings , i.  e. the distance beyond which directions along the string are uncorrelated .",
    "the second scale , @xmath111 , is the average inter - string separation .",
    "scaling implies that both length scales grow in proportion to the horizon .",
    "simulations indicate that @xmath112 , while @xmath113 , with @xmath114 in the matter era @xcite .",
    "the one - scale model @xcite , in which the two length scales are assumed to be equal , has been quite successful in describing the general properties of cosmic string networks inferred from numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations have assumed that cosmic strings would reconnect on every intersection .",
    "it is of interest to us , however , to also consider the case when the reconnection probability is less than one . if strings can move and interact in extra dimensions then , while appearing to intersect in our three dimensions , they may actually miss each other .",
    "hence , the effective intercommutation rate of these strings will generally be smaller than unity . as a consequence",
    ", one would expect more strings per horizon in these theories .",
    "because of the straightening of wiggles on sub - horizon scales due to the expansion of the universe , one would still expect @xmath115 .",
    "however , the string density would increase , therefore reducing the inter - string distance . hence , smaller inter - commutation probabilities imply smaller @xmath116 .",
    "consider a string network in a volume @xmath117 described by the two length scales introduced above . on average",
    "there is one string segment of length @xmath118 per volume @xmath119 .",
    "the rough number of such string segments is n = v l^2  .",
    "if the energy per unit length is @xmath6 , then the total energy of the string network is e = n = v l^2  . and",
    "the energy density is just @xmath120 .",
    "now suppose we want to calculate the effect of this string network on the cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "in particular , we want to find the power spectrum , i.  e. the 2-point function . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that only @xmath121 affects cmb ( in general we would have to consider all components of the string network s energy - momentum tensor @xmath122 ) . then to evaluate the cmb power spectrum it suffices to know the 2-point unequal time correlators @xmath123 at all @xmath76 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 . here",
    "@xmath126 is the fourier transform of @xmath127 .",
    "the cmb power spectrum is roughly given by c_l = dk dt_1 dt_2  _ l(t_1,t_2,k )  , where @xmath128 is a linear operator .",
    "again , for simplicity , let us assume that @xmath129 and @xmath130 at all times , namely that the network scales perfectly with time .",
    "we want to see how @xmath131 , or equivalently @xmath123 , depends on @xmath116 and @xmath6 .",

    ". such weak dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath26 can be explained by multiple opportunities for string reconnection during one crossing time , due to small - scale wiggles .",
    "we have performed a partial statistical analysis in which we held the parameters of the background cosmological model ( total , matter , baryon and dark energy density parameters , hubble constant , reionization optical depth ) fixed at their wmap best fit values according to @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we considered a flat @xmath154cdm universe with @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158  km / s / mpc and @xmath159 .",
    "the scalar spectral index @xmath107 was allowed to vary within bounds set by the prior @xmath160 , in increments of @xmath161 .",

    "the string intercommutation probability @xmath2 was approximately @xmath162 and was allowed to vary only insignificantly during the radiation - matter domination transition .",
    "the cmbr and linear matter power spectra for both adiabatic and string parts were computed using respectively modified versions of cmbfast @xcite .",
    "however , one can not directly compare linear matter spectra outputted by cmbfast to the galaxy clustering data published by the 2dfgrs team .",
    "we have `` processed '' the theoretical power spectrum @xmath163 for both adiabatic and string components following a procedure similar to that prescribed in section 5.1.4 of @xcite .",
    "first of all , we output @xmath163 at the effective redshift of the 2dfgrs survey : @xmath164 ( the valued suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "then we correct for the redshift space distortions using the approximate formula given in @xcite : p^th(k ) p^th_z(k ) = ( 1 + 2 3 + 15 ^2 ) p^th(k )  , with @xmath165 .",

    "we have investigated both possibilities and will refer to them the `` @xmath108-free '' and `` @xmath108-fixed '' model .",
    "we are interested in constraining the fractional contribution to the wmap and 2dfgrs data given by eq .",
    "( [ clsuperpos ] ) . to do this properly , from first principles , would require using theoretical models with both cosmic strings and adiabatic perturbations to generate the relevant sky maps , and then compare these directly to the data to compute likelihood functions that can be used , along with appropriate priors , the posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the models . to get a quick and dirty bound on the most interesting parameter , @xmath3 , we have chosen to adopt a simpler approach in which we treat the published results for @xmath131 of the tt and te sky maps , and the 2dfgrs power spectra as data , and use them and their uncertainties to construct a @xmath168 statistic in the usual way . for each value of @xmath3 , we minimize the statistic with respect to variations in the parameters @xmath107 , @xmath105 , and the bias parameter , to find @xmath169 .",
    "if our `` data '' really represented independent data points , then we could be confident that at each @xmath3 the value of @xmath169 would obey a distribution that roughly has a mean value equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the fit , @xmath170 , and a standard deviation @xmath171 .",
    "[ fig : chiminall ] shows the results for @xmath108-free ( left ) and @xmath108-fixed ( right ) ( as defined at the end of ",

    "we keep cosmological paramters such as @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 fixed at their best fit values from @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have either three ( @xmath107 , @xmath105 , and @xmath108 for @xmath108-free evaluation ) or two ( @xmath107 and @xmath105 for @xmath108-fixed evaluation ) parameters in each of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiminall ] , so @xmath178 ( @xmath108-freee ) or @xmath179 ( @xmath108-fixed ) , and @xmath180 in either case . since the two panels in the figure actually show the reduced statistic @xmath181 , we could regard values of @xmath3 with @xmath181 within approximately @xmath182 of the minimum value as representing more or less equally good fits to the data to within @xmath183 `` sigma '' .",
    "below , we shall use @xmath184 for placing a limit on @xmath3 ; this can be interpreted as either a 1.7``@xmath32 '' bound , or as a crude attempt to account for the fact that we are also ignoring the effects of varying several more cosmological parameters .",
    "although assessing the acceptability of models with different values of @xmath3 is not justified rigorously , we note that the minimum values of @xmath185 shown in either panel of fig .",

    "here we find that the lowest value of the minimum @xmath181 is at @xmath198 , not @xmath189 . in view of the limitations of our statistical analysis , one can not attach much significance to either the existence of this minimum , or the precise nonzero @xmath3 at which it occurs , but it is worth observing that adding a small string contribution may be welcome when matching the cmbr normalized matter spectra to the galaxy data .",
    "moreover , this result shows that at the very least we can not exclude values of @xmath199 .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath191 corresponding to the minimum @xmath168 per degree of freedom grow with @xmath3 in this panel and , for @xmath4 , they fall within the range @xmath200 .    in figures [ fig :",

    "the simple adiabatic @xmath154cdm model with a constant @xmath107 fits the wmap data very well in general , but much worse so on very large scales .",
    "for the first few multipoles , @xmath202 , the experiment finds a clear deficit of power , as compared to the prediction of the model .",
    "one could hope that , because cosmic strings generically predict such lack of power for low multipoles , adding a string component would improve the fit on large scales . however , as one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig : free ] and [ fig : fixed ] , this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that cosmic strings fit the data extremely poorly in the region of the first and the second acoustic peaks , where the wmap error bars on @xmath131s are _ very _ small .",
    "the `` benefit '' from adding strings on larger scales , where the error bars are large , is offset by the much larger `` damage '' that strings cause when fitting on smaller scales .",

    "( [ bdep ] ) , @xmath207 .",
    "because cosmic strings produce a sizeable vector perturbation , in addition to the @xmath208-polarization , they can also induce the @xmath3-type polarization of the cmbr . in fig .",

    "it appears that , even if cosmic strings were contributing only a few percent to the cmb temperature anisotropy , they could contribute a b - mode signal on scales @xmath210 that would be in excess of the expected b - mode produced by lensing of the e - mode by galaxies @xcite .",
    "such a detection would be an important test for the existence of cosmic strings .",
    "cosmic strings appear to be a likely by - product of inflation in superstring cosmology .",
    "although these cosmological models are only just beginning to be developed in sufficient detail for comparisons with data to be possible , most models seem to feature a string scale comparable to or slightly smaller than the gut scale , and cosmic string tensions @xmath211 .",
    "these expectations motivate studying models in which cmb fluctuations and large scale structure are the consequence of both growing modes associated with perturbations generated from quantum fluctuations during inflation , and active perturbations associated with the gravitational effects of a network of cosmic strings . here , we have presented an attempt at such an analysis , based on a rough comparison of theoretical models with both adiabatic perturbations and cosmic strings with wmap tt and te power spectra as well as the 2dfgrs results on galaxy correlation functions .",
    "our results need to be improved in various ways , both by allowing numerous cosmological parameters we held fixed to vary , and by computing likelihood functions , rather than using a rough criterion based on a reduced @xmath168 statistic .",
    "nevertheless , they already indicate that although the data currently available generally favor models without cosmic strings , they may not exclude nonzero cosmic string tension and density definitively , provided the growth of fluctuations in the universe is not dominated by cosmic strings . rather conservatively",

    "we intend to present results of a more comprehensive study which would include varying all cosmological parameters as well as the relevant parameters of the string model , including their specific predictions for @xmath5 , and a better justified statistical analysis based on codes made available by the wmap team for computing likelihood functions for any model for the production of temperature pertubations @xcite .",
    "( some modifications will be needed to account for the nongaussianity of the cosmic string perturbations . ) in addition to the wmap and the 2dfgrs data , the analysis will also include the latest results from the sload digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",

    "another potentially distinguishing signature of cosmic strings could be the detection of cosmological non - gaussianity .",
