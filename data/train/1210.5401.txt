    "it is a remarkable fact that a generic state of a quantum system of moderate dimension is unlikely to be physically realisable .",
    "this is because physically accessible states occupy only a tiny submanifold of the full hilbert space @xmath0 , as follows from a simple counting argument ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the submanifold of physically accessible states has been christened _ the physical corner of hilbert space _ ; states in this corner exhibit highly nongeneric features : a quantum state chosen at random from @xmath1 is massively entangled and locally featureless @xcite while , in stark contrast , the manifold of physical states realized in nature exhibit short - range correlations , and often obey entropy area laws @xcite .",
    "the fact that physically realisable states are not generic has important practical consequences for the calculation of observable properties . instead of parametrising a physical state using a complete ( exponentially large basis ) of hilbert space ,",
    "entropy area laws suggest that there is a more efficient description where only the physical degrees of freedom participating in short - ranged correlations are used .",
    "such a parametrisation , if found , would allow unprecedented insights when combined with the _ variational method_.    a compelling example of an efficient parametrisation of the physical corner is found in the study of one - dimensional strongly interacting quantum lattice systems @xcite . the archetypal variational class here is the set of _ matrix product states _",
    "( mps ) @xcite .",
    "the variational method applied to mps , synonymous with the _ density matrix renormalisation group _ @xcite , has enjoyed unparalleled success in the study of the equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum lattice systems .",
    "the mps class has now been extended far beyond the one - dimensional setting to arbitrary quantum lattice systems where they are now understood as examples of _ tensor networks_. the two most notable tensor networks are the _ projected entangled - pair states _ ( peps ) @xcite and the _ multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz _ ( mera ) @xcite . both of these classes have been applied with considerable success to the study of strongly correlated physics in two dimensions and beyond for noncritical and critical systems .",
    "tensor networks such as peps and mera are not yet able to explain all the physics of low - dimensional lattice systems , but already many new insights have been obtained .",
    "while the mps and mera classes are naturally defined in the presence of a lattice , they have both @xcite been generalised in a natural way to continuous quantum systems . here",
    "a basic challenge is that a discrete collection of degrees of freedom is replaced by a _",
    "continuous _ collection .",
    "this means that , for a tensor network state , a contraction of a discrete collection of tensors needs to be replaced by the `` contraction '' of a now continuous set of tensors .",
    "here we argue that the most natural systematic way to achieve this is to replace the tensor contraction with a _ path integral _ over some now continuous auxiliary degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the core objective of this paper is to obtain and study such a path - integral representation for the cmps class .",
    "this representation will then be used as the basis for higher - dimensional generalisations in a forthcoming paper .",
    "here we review the mps class and sketch some of its properties .",
    "our intent is to make this paper accessible to those with a diversity of backgrounds , so we have tried to provide all the necessary prerequisite material and references needed to follow our argument here .",
    "readers with a familiarity with mps and the dmrg are invited to skim this section lightly to fix notation .",
    "we begin by recalling that any bipartite pure quantum state @xmath2 admits a schmidt decomposition @xmath3 for some set of local bases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for pure states @xmath6 of one - dimensional quantum spin systems @xmath7 with local dimension @xmath8 , we may perform a schmidt decomposition iteratively on the bipartitions @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 , \\cdots$ ] @xmath11 $ ] ( where @xmath12 is the complement of @xmath13 and @xmath14 $ ] denotes the particular bipartite split ) to obtain the mps representation @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is a collection of @xmath8 matrices of size @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a row vector of dimension @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a column vector of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "the dimensions @xmath23 are called the _ bond dimensions _ of the mps and characterize the degree of entanglement entropy across a cut at site @xmath24 .",
    "this construction shows that mps are an  _ expressive _ class , meaning that _ any _ state may be represented as an mps with a sufficiently large choice of the @xmath23s ( the argument applies to _ any _ pure state ) .",
    "however , in most implementations we simply assume that the bond dimension is constant and truncate it at some value @xmath25 , which acts as a _ refinement parameter _ for this class .    matrix product state representations ( [ eq : mps ] ) possess several remarkable properties .",
    "the first , and most important , is that they provide an efficient parametrisation of naturally occurring states @xcite ; it is now understood that mps can very efficiently represent both the ground states of models with a spectral gap and also the non - equilibrium dynamics of any quantum spin chain .",
    "the second property is that they possess an entropy area law @xcite , meaning that the von neumann entropy of any contiguous block of spins is bounded above by a constant , i.e. , the size of the boundary .",
    "another important property of mps is a _ gauge _ degree of freedom , so they supply an over - complete parametrisation .",
    "a matrix product state ( [ eq : mps ] ) is an example of a quantum state known as a _ tensor network state _ ( tns ) . to define a tns",
    "one first associates a finite graph @xmath26 with the quantum system where the physical degrees of freedom , which are quantum spins of dimension @xmath8 , live on the vertices @xmath27 , and the edges @xmath28 encode _ auxiliary _ degrees of freedom . to each vertex",
    "@xmath29 we associate a tensor @xmath30 with @xmath31 indices , where @xmath32 is the _ degree _ of the vertex @xmath29 .",
    "each index @xmath33 is associated with a corresponding edge @xmath34 incident with the vertex @xmath29 and takes values @xmath35 ; these are the _ auxiliary bond indices_. the index @xmath36 is the _ physical index _ and takes values @xmath37",
    ". the tns corresponding to this arrangement of tensors is then given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the _ contraction _ of all the auxiliary indices , i.e. , each pair of tensor indices associated with each edge are separately summed .",
    "such tnss may be represented pictorially where we draw a `` leg '' for each index of each tensor and join contracted indices with lines .",
    "physical indices are drawn as unpaired arrows .",
    "for example , the simple tensor network resulting from the multiplication of two matrices @xmath40 , is represented by : @xmath41\\txt{$a$}\\ar[l]_{\\alpha}\\ar@{-}[r]^{\\beta } & * + [ f-:<3pt>]\\txt{${b}$}\\ar[r]^{\\gamma}&.   } \\ ] ]    in the case of an mps we associate with each tuple of matrices @xmath16 , regarded as a _ three - index tensor _",

    "the way to take a continuum limit of a tns is to choose the tensors @xmath53 so that as the spacing between the sites goes to zero the _ density _ of particles / excitations in the system remains constant . in one dimension , for mps , this is achieved @xcite by choosing @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are arbitrary @xmath57 matrices and @xmath58 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we ll see in the next section that with this choice of @xmath53s the path integral ( [ eq : dfpi ] ) reduces , in the limit @xmath59 , to a standard path integral . in the sequel to this paper",
    ", we ll show that a similar recipe works for any sufficiently regular lattice .",
    "continuous matrix product states are a variational class of states for one - dimensional quantum fields .",

    "we wish to reformulate the cmps state ( [ eq : cmps2 ] ) so that expectation values for the auxiliary system are recast as path - integral expressions .",
    "the motivation for this is two - fold : firstly , to facilitate the passage to higher - dimensional cmps states ; and secondly , to make manifest the symmetries of the physical state in terms of symmetries of an action for the auxiliary system .",
    "our discussion is centred on the case of a single bosonic field in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ; the generalisation to spinor and vector fields follows easily , and we only comment on the modifications required .",
    "write a basis for the hilbert space @xmath72 of @xmath65 as @xmath73 .",
    "we enlarge this space via second quantisation , i.e. , by either introducing bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 according to the canonical commutation relations : @xmath76 = \\delta_{j , k } , \\quad j = 0 , 1 , \\ldots , d-1,\\ ] ] with all other commutators vanishing , or fermionic annihilation and creation operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 according to the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath79 with all other anticommutators vanishing .",
    "the configuration space for our enlarged auxiliary system is that of _ fock space _ @xmath80 , where the @xmath81 subscript indicates either bosonic or fermionic fock space .",
    "the connection between @xmath72 and our enlarged fock space @xmath80 is made , in the bosonic case , by identifying @xmath72 with the single - particle sector via @xmath82 or , in the fermionic case , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the fock vacuum .",
    "we identify , whenever clear from the context , states @xmath85 with their single - particle counterparts in @xmath80 .    using this embedding ,",

    "we then obtain a path integral by dividing @xmath94 $ ] into small intervals @xmath95 with uniform spacing @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 , and insert resolutions of the identity between each term .",
    "our choice of resolution is , in the bosonic case , in terms of coherent states of the auxiliary system , defined as @xmath98|\\omega_\\b\\>$ ] : @xmath99 where @xmath100 . in the fermionic case we exploit fermion coherent states of the form @xmath101|\\omega_\\b\\>$ ] , where @xmath102 are now _ grassmann - valued_. apart from the use of anticommuting grassmann numbers the fermionic calculation mirrors the bosonic case in essentially all other respects",
    "; we thus focus on the details of the bosonic calculation and write out the fermionic case at the end .    after the resolution ( [ eq : boscohres ] ) has been placed between each term we end up with a product of transition amplitudes of the form @xmath103 .",
    "we then make use of the expression @xmath104\\ ] ] and the assumption that only smooth variations of @xmath105 contribute , which allows us to expand the terms in the exponential and obtain , in the continuum limit @xmath59 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    where the path integral is over @xmath64 complex fields and @xmath107 is an _ operator - valued _ action given by @xmath108 where we ve written @xmath109 as a vector @xmath110 . however , since the field operator @xmath111 commutes with @xmath112 and @xmath113 at all other points @xmath114 the ordering over the auxiliary time variable is trivial and we can simply write the path integral as @xmath115 |\\phi\\>}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is a _ physical _ field coherent state @xmath117 |\\omega_\\a\\>,\\ ] ] @xmath118 , and the complex action @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 this formulation ( [ pathcmps ] ) of the one - dimensional cmps state as a path integral is one of our guiding expressions for the generalisation to higher - dimensional scenarios which we describe in a sequel paper .",
    "the fermionic case is identical , except that @xmath110 is now a vector of grassmann fields .",
    "of course , both the bosonic and fermionic cases yield exactly the same physical state @xmath121 , since they coincide on the 1-particle sector .",
    "notice that we ve dropped the limits from the integrals ; the expression ( [ pathcmps ] ) makes equal sense for quantum systems on @xmath94 $ ] as for the infinite case @xmath122 .",
    "let s pause to interpret ( [ eq : cmps2 ] ) for a moment .",
    "what these equations are saying is that a cmps is a superposition of coherent states @xmath116 with some weighting @xmath123 .",
    "the standard intuition concerning coherent states is that they are the `` most classical '' states of a quantum system due to their saturation of the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "thus , ( [ pathcmps ] ) tells us that a cmps is a superposition of `` classical '' field states centred around classical field configurations @xmath124 in phase space .",
    "these field configurations @xmath125 themselves are scalar functions of a vector of _ auxiliary _ classical fields @xmath126 . by interpreting that spatial variable @xmath93 as a temporal variable one can understand the action @xmath119 for these auxiliary fields as that of a @xmath127-dimensional quantum field , i.e. , ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "one has the picture of an auxiliary system undergoing a classical trajectory of its discrete variables , however to gain information ( by measurement ) about a dynamically evolving quantum system we inevitable disturb it because of the back - action of the quantum measurement .",
    "the closest representation of the dynamics in this quantum setting is to _ continuously monitor _ the evolving auxiliary system with a sequence of infinitesimally weak measurements @xcite . by exploiting von neumann s prescription for quantum measurement this process",
    "is then understood as _ entangling _ the auxiliary system and an infinite collection of _ meter _ systems .",
    "the combined auxiliary system+meter collection undergoes completely positive dynamics . in the continuum limit",
    "the meter systems constitute a quantum field with one extra spatial dimension , the reduced state of the meters alone is a quantum state .",
    "the cmps coherent field state is then an imprint of the discrete trajectory , and is as classical a record as possible .",
    "the stength and manner of this imprint is entirely contained in the particular coupling @xmath128 .",
    "each trajectory for the auxiliary system contributes a coherent field state , and the cmps is simply a superposition of `` classical '' trajectories with the according weighting by the action @xmath119 .    : here a sample classical trajectory for the ( in this case , three ) auxiliary fields is depicted above .",
    "these classical trajectories are then combined via @xmath129 into a single complex scalar trajectory @xmath130 .",
    "the field coherent state is then represented diagrammatically via the ket with the purple smeared trajectory ( the idea is that a field coherent state is like a smeared - out classical configuration centred on the classical configuration @xmath131 ) . the formula for the resulting cmps is then a superposition of such coherent states weighted by the `` action '' @xmath119 . ]",
    "in this section we show that an arbitrary one - dimensional quantum field state is expressible as a cmps , as long as the bond dimension @xmath64 is allowed to become arbitrarily large .",
    "the argument we present here is for the case of bosonic fock space @xmath132))$ ] on a _ finite _ interval @xmath94 $ ] , however , it is expected to be valid in the more general case of the interval @xmath122 .",
    "the argument is rather simple and relies on three facts .",
    "the first is that an arbitrary quantum field coherent state @xmath133 |\\omega_\\a\\>,\\ ] ] is exactly representible as a cmps @xmath134 with bond dimension @xmath135 .",
    "this follows upon taking @xmath67 and @xmath56 to be the one - dimensional matrices @xmath136 and @xmath137 . the boundary vectors @xmath138 and @xmath21 are simply taken to be equal to @xmath139 .",
    "the next fact we require is that the set of all field coherent states is _ dense _ in fock space , meaning that an arbitrary field state @xmath140))$ ] may be approximated arbitrarily well by an increasing linear combination of field coherent states : @xmath141 the final fact we need is that a linear combination @xmath142 of two cmps @xmath143 and @xmath144 with bond dimensions @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively , is again a cmps with bond dimension @xmath147 and parameters @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "putting these facts together allows us to deduce that @xmath152 is a sequence of cmps with bond dimensions @xmath153 that tend , in the limit , to an arbitrary state @xmath154 in fock space .",
    "thus we have confirmed the _ completeness _ or _ expressiveness _ property of the cmps variational class in one dimension .",
    "it is worth noting that the argument we present here is by no means the most economical : there are , exploiting gauge invariance , almost certainly more efficient sequences of representations tending to the state @xmath154 using lower bond dimensions . indeed , as we argue in the next section , a more economical representation of a physical field state is strongly suggested by the path integral representation .",
    "it is worth noting that in the previous subsection we showed that an arbitrary cmps is a superposition of field coherent states .",
    "here we ve shown the converse : an arbitrary superposition of field coherent states is also a cmps .",
    "in this section we show how naturally occurring physical states are efficiently represented via cmps . intuitively , the argument presented here is a continuum version of that appearing in @xcite , i.e. , we exchange the role of space and time and contract the ( continuum ) tensor network for the state of a dynamically evolving field along the spatial axis first , regarding it is a temporal axis .",
    "we frame our results in the bosonic setting , although the extension to the fermion case is straightforward .",
    "the generic situation we consider is therefore that of bosons moving in @xmath155 with field annihilation @xmath156 and creation @xmath157 operators obeying the canonical commutation relations @xmath158",
    "= \\delta(x - y ) , $ ] with all other commutators vanishing .",
    "the hamiltonian , in second quantisation , is taken to have the standard kinetic+potential energy form : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and with an interaction potential @xmath161 for simplicity we will concentrate here on ultralocal interactions , i.e. @xmath162 , with @xmath163 being a constant .",
    "we consider a field system , initialized in the physical state @xmath164 and allow it to evolve under the full hamiltonian @xmath165 for a time @xmath166 , until it reaches the state @xmath167 .",
    "our task is to show that the final state @xmath168 admits a natural description in terms of the cmps path integral representation , which can be interpreted instead as a ( virtual ) process in which some additional auxiliary system @xmath169 undergoes dissipative dynamics that couple it to the physical field system and on completion generates @xmath170 . to avoid confusion , in the case of the _ physical _ evolution of the field system @xmath171 we use @xmath172 for the spatial coordinate , and @xmath173 for the physical time coordinate , while for the virtual process in which the auxiliary system @xmath169 couples to the physical field @xmath171 we use @xmath93 for the virtual time coordinate of @xmath169 and label _ subsystems _ of @xmath169 with the parameter @xmath174 .",
    "the construction that follows will roughly amount to reinterpreting the field variables @xmath175 as @xmath176 within a quite physically distinct setting .",
    "our first move is to reformulate the physical field evolution in terms of a path integral expression over coherent states .",
    "the construction proceeds , as usual , by discretising the time interval @xmath177 $ ] into @xmath178 pieces of length @xmath179 and writing @xmath180 we suppose , for simplicity , that the initial state @xmath181 is a field coherent state .    as in the construction of the auxiliary action",

    "we find that an infinitesimal advance for the physical system is described by    @xmath184    with a hamiltonian density @xmath185 given by @xmath186 summing over each time interval yields the expression @xmath187 being a superposition of physical coherent states described by @xmath188 at time @xmath189 , and with the action @xmath190 the lower limit of this path integral is @xmath191 while the upper limit is unconstrained .",
    "the path integral form of @xmath168 is suggestive of how an auxiliary system should couple to the physical system in order to generate @xmath168 under ( virtual ) dissipative dynamics . since we wish the auxilary system @xmath169 to sweep over the length of the physical field the time parameter for the process",
    "@xmath93 , should correspond to the physical spatial variable @xmath172 .",
    "to capture this idea we could subdivide the auxiliary system @xmath169 into harmonic oscillator subsystems as @xmath192 , labelled by some variable @xmath174 , however since @xmath173 is a continuous variable we shall effectively be taking the limit in which @xmath169 is an _",
    "auxiliary _ complex field where @xmath174 is its spatial coordinate and the auxiliary system has _",
    "extent from @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "the key point is that spatial couplings ( along @xmath174 ) within the hamiltonian of the auxiliary system can be used to simulate the physical dynamics that generates @xmath168 , as the auxiliary system sweeps out over the physical field , and couples to it through a natural interaction term .    for the auxiliary variables we use @xmath195 and @xmath196 , which we can combine into a single complex field as @xmath197 .",
    "the free hamiltonian of the auxiliary system is taken to be @xmath198 and where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the momenta conjugate to @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the form of ( [ eq : realtime ] ) suggests that the interaction term coupling the auxiliary and physical systems be taken to be the continuous measurement interaction in which the physical system @xmath171 is interpreted as continuously measuring the ` observable ' @xmath203 .",

    "the calculation proceeds in a similar manner to the earlier cmps path integral calculation evolving under the composite hamiltonian @xmath213 , however for our resolution of the identity at auxiliary time @xmath93 we use the complete set of states @xmath214 given by @xmath215 .",

    "the cmps representation that we have constructed involves an infinite dimensional auxiliary system where integration over @xmath174 corresponds to a continuum summation over the auxiliary indices ; this is not unexpected since the auxiliary system faithfully simulates the entire dynamical history of the physical field .",
    "however , the local character of the interaction term implies that we can obtain @xmath168 equally well from the coupling of a single auxiliary oscillator to the physical field , with the composite system now undergoing a more general completely - positive map ( instead of a unitary interaction ) .",
