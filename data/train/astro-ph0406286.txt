    "we obtain about 7000 counts in the total 0.3 - 8 kev band , after background subtraction , corresponding to a count rate of 0.35 @xmath18 .",

    "cameras were operated in full frame mode with the thin filter applied .",
    "the data have been cleaned and processed in the standard pipeline mode using the science analysis software ( sas ) .",
    "the event files for the pn and the two mos detectors were produced using the standard reduction pipeline ( watson et al .",
    "the event files were screened for high particle background periods resulting in a good time interval of about 5.5 ksec for both mos and pn .",

    "the coordinates of the x - ray source are @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( j2000 ) ; note that the _ iras _ name for this object refers to b1950 .",

    "given that the nominal point spread function ( psf ) is undersampled by the pixels of the acis camera ( fwhm@xmath25 at 1.5  kev , compared to a pixel size of @xmath26 ) we consider the probability of any extension marginal .",
    "indeed , the gaussian fit to the point spread function generated with the ciao mkpsf task gives a comparable fwhm ( @xmath27 pixels ) .",
    "1 shows that the central uv - bright source in iras20051 - 1117   is surrounded by some faint nebulosity which is associated with the galaxy .",
    "the nuclear source appears to be point - like in the uv . in order to investigate this issue further , we co - added the 5 uvw1 and uvw2 images to create a single image .",
    "using iraf , we fitted the one - dimensional radial profile of the central source in both filters with a gaussian .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian profile is @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the case of the uvw1 and uvw2 images , respectively .",
    "the profile of the uvw1 source appears to be slightly larger than the width of the nominal psf for this filter ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the fwhm of the uvw2 source is identical to the psf width for this filter ( @xmath31 ) . as the contribution of the underlying galaxy",
    "is much more pronounced in the uvw1 image , our results imply that , just like with the x - ray source , the uv source is not resolved either , its size being equal to or smaller than @xmath32 which corresponds to @xmath151.4 kpc .",
    "2 ( upper panel ) shows the background subtracted pn and mos light curves for iras20051 - 1117  in the 0.3 - 8 kev band ( open squares , filled and open circles for pn , mos-1 and mos-2 light curves , respectively ) .",
    "the time bin size was set to 200 sec .",
    "all cameras were switched on about the same time , however there are a few gaps of duration @xmath33 sec in all light curves , due to the rejetion of periods with high particle background .",
    "the light curves appear to be flat , with no significant variations above the intrumental noise . using the @xmath34 test , we find that the light curves are consistent with the hypothesis of a constant flux .",

    "kev light curve does not show any significant , intrinsic variations either ( fig .",
    "2 , lower panel ) .",
    "we conclude that iras20051 - 1117  does not show any significant variations on time scales smaller than @xmath35 ksec .",
    "next , we examine whether there is any evidence for long term variability . using the best fit power - law spectrum derived from the pn data ( @xmath36 see section 3.3 below )",
    "we derive a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39from the _ xmm - newton  _ ( pn ) and _ chandra  _ data respectively , suggesting that the nucleus presents no variability .",
    "however , as the _ chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ observations are separated by a small interval of about 3 weeks , we have also checked whether other x - ray missions have obtained in the past observations of our object .",
    "_ rosat _ ( pspc ) has observed iras20051 - 1117  in the second semester of 1990 during the rosat - all - sky - survey ( exposure time 411s ) .",
    "the count rate of @xmath40 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) translates to an absorbed flux of @xmath41 @xmath39 in the 0.3 - 2 kev band ( using the best - fit pn model ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ flux in the same energy band ( @xmath42 @xmath39 ) , within @xmath43 .",
    "the spectra are grouped , using the ftool grppha task to give a minimum of 20 ( 15 ) counts per bin for _ xmm - newton  _ ( _ chandra  _ ) to ensure that gaussian statistics apply .",
    "the quoted errors to the best fitting spectral parameters correspond to the 90 % confidence level for one interesting parameter . in order to assess",
    "the significance of new parameters added to a model we have adopted the 95 % confidence level , using the _",
    "f_-test for additional terms .",
    "we discard data below 0.3 and above 8 kev due to the low response of the acis - s , pn and mos cameras .",
    "we fit the data using the xspec v11.2 software package .",
    "the spectral fits are presented separately for the _",
    "chandra  _ and the _ xmm - newton  _ data .",
    "we first fit the pn data using a single power - law model absorbed by two columns : one fixed to the galactic ( @xmath44 dickey & lockman 1990 ) and one intrinsic which is left free to vary .",
    "we find that this model provides a relatively poor fit ( @xmath45 ) to the data .",
    "the power - law has the canonical slope , @xmath46 , while the 90 % upper limit of the intrinsic column is @xmath47 .",
    "the addition of a narrow line ( @xmath48 kev i.e. smaller than the ccd s spectral resolution at these energies ) at 6.4 kev ( rest - frame ) results in a better fit .",
    "we find @xmath49 for one additional parameter ( the normalization of the gaussian line ) which is statistically significant at the @xmath50 % confidence level .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe line is @xmath51 ev consistent with that predicted for unobscured agn",
    "( e.g. page et al .",
    "2004 ) with comparable x - ray luminosity .",
    "the spectral results are presented in table 1 . in fig .",
    "3 ( upper panel ) we plot the model fit to the data together with the data to model ratio . inspection of the residuals suggests the possibility that some additional lines are present : e.g. fe at 6.96 kev , ca at 3.9 kev , si at 1.9 kev ( rest - frame ) . however , only the first line ( fe ) is detected at over the 95 per cent confidence level . the resulting equivalent width is @xmath52 ev . the presence of residuals at low energies prompted us to test for the presence of thermal emission .",
    "the inclusion of a raymond - smith spectrum ( abundance fixed at z=0.3 ) results in a significantly better fit @xmath53 .",
    "the temperature of this component ( @xmath54 kev ) is consistent with the properties of hot gas emission in nearby star - forming galaxies ( e.g. stevens et al .",
    "its luminosity is @xmath55 @xmath8 .",
    "the mos data are fitted with the normalizations untied between the mos1 and mos2 detectors .",

    "the low effective area of the mos detectors at high energies , hampers us from placing any constraints on the properties of the fe lines above 6 kev .",
    "the addition of an fe line results in the reduction of the @xmath60 by only @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of a raymond - smith component is not statistically significant . finally , a joint fit to the pn and mos data ( with the normalizations between the 3 detectors untied ) yields @xmath62",
    ", @xmath63 @xmath59 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the normalizations between the 2 mos instruments agree within 5% while those between mos and pn within 20 % .",

    "a single power - law fit to the data gives @xmath68 with a negligible intrinsic column density of @xmath69 @xmath59 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the above values are in reasonable agreement with those derived from the pn .",
    "the addition of an fe line at 6.4 kev reduces the @xmath60 by 6.9 which is statistically significant at the @xmath71 % confidence level . the equivalent width of the line is @xmath72 ev , comparable to the value found from the model fitting of the pn data . the _ chandra  _ spectrum is plotted in fig .",
    "3 ( lower panel ) together with the data to model ratio . finally ,",
    "the addition of a raymond - smith component results in the improvement of the fit ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the temperature of the raymond - smith component is @xmath74 kev in good agreement with _ xmm - newton  _ while the power - law photon index is flatter ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath60 , when the thermal component is added , may suggest the presence of a compact nuclear star - forming region .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that many _ photo - ionization _ line residuals at soft energies are reduced with the inclusion of the above component .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations were made with the 1.3 m telescope at skinakas observatory ( crete , greece ) on 2002 june 21 .",
    "the f/7.7 ritchey - cretien telescope was equipped with a @xmath76 site chip plus a 651 lines mm@xmath77 grating , giving a dispersion of @xmath78   / pix .",
    "we used a 2@xmath79 slit which corresponds to a physical size of @xmath80 kpc at the redshift of our object .",
    "the spectra span the @xmath81   range , at a resolution of @xmath15 7.0 fwhm .",
    "the total integration time was 1.5 hrs .",
    "the optical spectrum of the source is shown in fig .",
    "it is similar to the spectrum presented by moran et al .",
    "we detect strong h@xmath82 , [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] and [ o iii ] and much weaker h@xmath83 ( narrow ) and [ o i ] lines .",
    "h@xmath82 has a broad component with a width of @xmath84 km / sec .",
    "our measurements of the galaxy emission line flux ratios are as follows : [ o iii]/h@xmath83(narrow)=1.1 , [ o i]/h@xmath82(narrow)=0.019 , h@xmath82(narrow)/h@xmath83(narrow)=2.65 , h@xmath82(broad)/h@xmath83(narrow ) = 3.69 , [ nii]/h@xmath82(narrow)=0.59 , and [ sii]/h@xmath82(narrow)=0.33 .",
    "the ratios for the bright lines are slightly smaller ( by a factor of @xmath85 ) than the respective values listed in table 3 of moran et al .",
    "these differences are not highly significant , specially if one considers the fact that different ratio values can be obtained if the seeing and/or extraction apertures differ since in this case different amounts of the host galaxy are included in the aperture .",
    "furthermore , for the fainter lines ( h@xmath83 and [ o i ] ) our measurements are quite uncertain because of the poor quality of the data ( the overall signal - to - noise of the optical spectrum is @xmath86 ) . despite these small differences , the position of the source on the standard emission line diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. veilleux et al . 1995 ) confirms that this object lies between the hii region and agn loci .    from the ratio between h@xmath82(narrow ) and h@xmath83",
    ", we calculate a reddening of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for an agn and an hii region intrinsic continuum respectively .",
    "these correspond to an equivalent hi column density of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , assuming galactic gas - to - dust ratio ( bohlin et al 1978 ) . as the reddening mentioned above",
    "refers to the sum of the galactic and intrinsic extinction , this result agrees well with the result of no intrinsic absorption as derived from the model fitting to the epic pn x - ray spectrum .",
    "the availability of simultaneous uv ( om ) and x - ray ( epic - pn ) observations by _ xmm - newton  _  gives us the opportunity to investigate the uv / x - ray energy distribution of the source . for the om data , we first estimated the mean count rate of the individual images ( as formed by summing the counts within a @xmath91 diameter aperture centered on the nucleus ) .",
    "we have not corrected for the contribution of the underlying galaxy , which increases towards larger wavelengths ( reaching @xmath92 % in the b filter ) .",
    "we transformed the average count rates to magnitudes using the appropriate zeropoint magnitude value for each filter ( as listed in the _ xmm - newton  _  users manual ) .",
    "for the reddening correction we assumed no intrinsic absorption , and adopted the galactic extinction value , @xmath93 , of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . using the @xmath94 versus @xmath95 relationship of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for @xmath96 , we then found @xmath94 at @xmath97 2900 , and 2150   ( i.e. the wavelengths at which the response of the b , uvw1 , and uvw2 filters peaks ) .    the uv / x - ray energy distribution is shown in fig . 5 , plotted as @xmath98 versus @xmath99 .",
    "for the x - ray data we used the best fitting power law model to the _ xmm - newton  _  epic - pn spectrum ( the long dashed lines represent power law models with slopes equal to the best fitting slope @xmath100 confidence limit values ) . in the uv band ,",
    "the ratio @xmath101 is comparable with the ratio of the respective frequencies .",
    "this result implies that @xmath102 , in agreement with the trend shown by the mean energy distribution of radio - quiet agn in the same energy band ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) . using the data shown in fig . 5",
    ", we find that the monochromatic x - ray ( 2 kev ) to uv ( 2500  ) luminosity ratio for iras20051 - 1117is @xmath103 .",
    "this is consistent with the average value of @xmath104 for radio - quiet agn ( stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the om , @xmath105 band measurement indicates that the sed rises towards longer wavelengths .",
    "this trend is caused by the fact the host galaxy s underlying emission in this band is quite stronger than the emission in the uv wavelengths .",
    "a quasi - simultaneous flux measurement at longer wavelengths is also possible based on the optical spectrum of the source . since",
    "this spectrum was taken only @xmath4 months after the _ xmm - newton  _  observation we used it in order to estimate a  v \" band measurement .",
    "to that aim , we computed the average flux in the @xmath106   band ( observer s frame ) , which is free of lines , and we dereddened it adopting @xmath107 , as before .",
    "interestingly , although the optical spectrum was taken using a @xmath19 wide slit ( i.e. significantly smaller than the aperture size that we use for the om photometry ) , the @xmath108 band flux that we measure is larger than that in the @xmath105 band .",
    "this result gives further support to the idea that the sed rises towards longer wavelengths .",
    "this trend is confirmed when we consider the near and far infrared measurements of the source . for the j , h , and k bands we used the 2mass measurements ( in a aperture of size @xmath109 ) . for the far - infrared band we used the iras measurements at @xmath110 and 100 microns , from the iras faint source catalogue .",
    "although the near - infrared and uv flux measurements are taken from apertures which have almost identical areas , the strong rise from optical to near - infrared wavelengths shown in fig .",
    "5 shows that the energy release in the near - infrared band is significantly larger than that released in the uv band . in iras20051 - 1117 , it is the near - infrared / optical which rises above its uv continuum , and not the other way around , as it is observed in most galaxies with a strong active nucleus .",
    "apart from the strong contribution of the galaxy stellar population in the near - infrared bands , the strong far infrared emission is indicative of the presence of a significant star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "for example , using the relation between logarithm of sfr and logarithm of galaxy luminosity at 100 microns of misiriotis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find an overall sfr of @xmath111 m@xmath112 yr@xmath77 .",
    "this is typical of bright iras galaxies , but much smaller than sfr in starburst galaxies .",
    "in this work , we present the results from x - ray and optical observations of iras20051 - 1117 .",
    "chandra  _  and _ xmm - newton  _  om images reveal the presense of a strong , uv and x - ray bright nuclear source , which is un - resolved in both cases .",
    "the fwhm of the x - ray source is @xmath113 , which corresponds to a region of size @xmath114 kpc at the distance of the object .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus is very similar to the typical agn spectra : a power - law model fitting to the epic - pn spectrum shows the canonical spectral slope of @xmath115 , and reveals the presence of an iron line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is consistent with that of unobscured agn of comparable luminosity ( e.g. page et al .",
    "we also detect evidence for the presence of ionized material in the vicinity of the nucleus , as indicated by the presence in the spectrum of a line at 6.96 kev which we interpret as emission from ionized iron . thermal emission with a low temperature ( 0.2 kev )",
    "is present in both the _ xmm - newton  _ and the _",
    "chandra  _ spectrum .",
    "the presence of a strong , point - like nuclear uv and x - ray source , with an x - ray spectrum typical of agn , shows conclusively that the intense x - ray emission of iras20051 - 1117  is produced by a seyfert - like nucleus in the center of this galaxy .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that the uv / x - ray energy spectral distribution of this object is very similar to the seds of agn in the same energy band . in particular , the  x - ray loudness \" of this object , @xmath116 ,",
    "is consistent with the average x - ray / uv luminosity ratio found for radio - quiet agns .",
    "however , optical observations that were performed only 2.5 months after the _ xmm - newton  _  observations of iras20051 - 1117 , reveal an optical spectrum very similar to the spectrum presented by moran et al .",
    "the emission - line flux ratios places this galaxy on the boundary between regions ordinarily populated by hii and seyfert galaxies .",
    "although there are signs of seyfert activity as well ( such as the presence of a weak , broad component of the h@xmath82 line ) , the optical spectrum is dominated by characteristics of hii galaxies .",
    "moran et al . (",
    "1996 ) have suggested that  obscuration \" effects may be responsible for the optical spectra of  composite \" galaxies .",
    "however , both the _ xmm - newton  _  and _ chandra  _  observations of iras20051 - 1117  show no sign of any intrinsic absorption in this galaxy . there is a possibility that the x - ray nucleus is totally obscured ( compton - thick ) in which case we are viewing the reflected component in the backside of the torus . the lack of variability between the _ xmm - newton  _ and the _",
    "chandra  _ epochs ( as well as the _ rosat  _ epoch ) could in principle favor such an interpretation . nevertheless , the moderate equivalent width of the fe line , combined with the steep x - ray spectrum ( see e.g. matt et al .",
    "1996 ) argue against the reflection component scenario .",
    "the detection of a strong nuclear uv source and of a broad @xmath117 in the low signal - to - noise optical spectrum further support the hypothesis that we are viewing directly the seyfert nucleus .",
    "ward et al .",
    "( 1988 ) have noted the presence of a tight correlation between the broad @xmath5 and the hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) luminosity in unobscured agn .",
    "our object has an @xmath5 luminosity of @xmath118 @xmath8(moran et al .",
    "1996 ) which translates to a predicted 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath119 @xmath8 , in excellent agreement with the _",
    "chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ observations , further suggesting that the broad line region is not obscured in our object .",
    "one possibility that could explain the optical spectral properties of iras20051 - 1117  is that it hosts a non - standard broad line region .",
    "for some reason , much less gas in the central source of this object is illuminated by the ionizing continuum , than in a typical agn . or",
    "perhaps , the broad line region may even be absent in this source . a third possibility",
    "though , and perhaps a more realistic one , is that the agn optical signature is not evident in this source because of the presence of a starburst component ( moran et al . , 1996 ) _ and _ because it is partially diluted by the presence of the strong optical continuum of the host galaxy . iras20051 - 1117  is a luminous spiral galaxy , as its optical / near - infrared excess emission in the overall sed implies ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "its total k - band magnitude is 11.28 ( 2mass survey ) which translates to an absolute magnitude of @xmath120 . using an average colour of @xmath121 , appropriate for spiral galaxies of morphological type @xmath122 ( de jong , 1996 ) , we find @xmath123 .",
    "severgnini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate that the optical signature of x - ray unabsorbed agn with x - ray luminosity up to @xmath124 @xmath8(the case of iras20051 - 1117 ) , may be hidden if they are hosted by a galaxy with @xmath125 . in fact , their calculations indicate that only h@xmath82 will show clearly the appearence of the central active nucleus , exactly like the case with iras20051 - 1117 , as only h@xmath82 shows clear evidence for a broad component .",
    "finally , we do not detect any significant variations in both the _ chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _  light curves .",
    "x - ray variability has become one of the defining characteristics of agn the last years .",
    "however , the lack of detection of significant variations is not surprising , given the short duration of the x - ray light curves .",
    "for example , the _ xmm - newton  _  epic - pn light curve is less than 10 ksec . for a @xmath126 erg / s source",
    ", we expect to measure an  excess variance \" , @xmath127 ( i.e. the variance of a light curve normalized by its mean squared after correcting for the experimental noise ) of @xmath128 in light curves as long as @xmath129 day ( e.g. nandra et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "if @xmath127 increases proportional to the length of the light curve , then we expect @xmath130 in the case of the present iras20051 - 1117  light curves . however , due to the low count rate , even in the combined epic pn and mos light curve , the uncertainty on the estimation of @xmath127 due to the experimental poisson noise ( found using equation 11 of vaughan et al . , 2003 )",
    "is twice as large as the expected  signal \" that we want to detect .",
    "clearly , a longer x - ray light curve is needed in order to detect significant , short term variations in iras20051 - 1117 .",
    "more surprising is the lack of  long term \" variations , when we compare the observed x - ray flux during the _ xmm - newton  _ _ chandra  _ and _ rosat  _ observations , which are separated by 3 weeks and 12 years , respectively .",
    "only monitoring x - ray observations over a period of months / years could allow us to investigate the variability behavior of this source .",
    "we present _ chandra  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ observations of iras20051 - 1117  one of the composite galaxies in the moran et al .",
    "( 1996 ) sample of galaxies .",
    "chandra  _ data show that the x - ray emission comes from a nuclear point - like source with a luminosity of @xmath131 @xmath8 .",
    "this coincides with a bright , uv nucleus as revealed by the uv imaging performed with the om on - board _ xmm - newton  _ . the x - ray spectrum ( _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ ) is represented by a power - law spectrum with a steep photon index @xmath1 and a thermal component with a temperature of @xmath2 kev absorbed by a negligible intrinsic column density @xmath132 @xmath59 . an fe line at 6.4 kev is also detected in both the _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ data with an equivalent width of @xmath133 ev .",
    "the above give away the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "there is no variability between the _ chandra  _ and the _ xmm - newton  _ flux which are separated by a small period of about 3 weeks .",
    "puzzlingly , there is no observed variability in the soft x - ray flux between _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ and the _ rosat  _ observation which are separated by a period of more than 12 years .",
    "the marked lack of variability could suggest the presence of a highly obscured ( compton - thick ) agn . however , this possibility is probably ruled out by the moderate equivalent width of the fe line , the steep x - ray spectrum observed and the ratio of the hard x - ray to the @xmath5 luminosity which are typical of unobscured agn .",
    "the nuclear optical spectrum ( using a @xmath19 slit which corresponds to a @xmath134 kpc region at the source ) obtained 2.5 months after the _ xmm - newton  _ observation , presents a weak broad @xmath5 line .",
    "nevertheless , the optical spectrum is dominated by a strong star - forming component which outshines the agn signatures .",
    "the weakness of the agn features could be attributed to the dilution of the nuclear agn emission by the star - forming component and the strong host galaxy optical emission .",
    "iras20051 - 1117  presents many similarities with the luminous x - ray galaxies which have been detected in deep x - ray surveys .",
    "although these are clearly associated with agn having high x - ray luminosities , their optical spectra show no agn signatures .",
    "the present observations help us to shed light on the properties of such objects and to understand why these fail to reveal strong agn signatures in the optical band .",
    "this work demonstrates in agreement with earlier work ( georgantopoulos et al .",
    "2003 , severgnini et al . 2003 ) that heavy obscuration may not always be responsible for the discrepancy observed between the x - ray and optical classification .",
    "this work has been supported by the nasa grant g01 - 2120x .",
    "support is also ackowledged by the grant x - ray astrophysics with esa s mission xmm in the framework of the programme excellence in research jointly funded by the the european union and the greek ministry of development .",
    "skinakas observatory is a collaborative project of the university of crete , the foundation for research and tecnology - hellas , and the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
