    "a sample of 8 qsos with @xmath3 has been observed @xcite with vlt / uves at a typical resolution @xmath4 and s / n @xmath5 .",
    "thanks to the two - arm design of the spectrograph @xcite , a high efficiency has been achieved in the whole optical range , from the atmospheric cutoff to @xmath6 , which translates immediately in the possibility of obtaining new results on the lyman forest , especially at @xmath7 .",
    "the data have been reduced with the uves pipeline @xcite - an non - negligible factor in maximizing the scientific output per unit time - and analyzed with the vpfit package @xcite .",
    "the swift increase of the number of absorptions ( and the average opacity ) with increasing redshift is the most impressive property of the ly-@xmath0  forest . fig .",
    "[ dndz ] shows the number density evolution of the ly-@xmath0  lines @xcite in the column density interval  has been chosen to allow a comparison with the hst key - programme sample at @xmath8 @xcite for which a threshold in equivalent width of 0.24  was adopted . ]",
    "the maximum - likelihood fit to the data at @xmath10 with the customary power - law parameterization provides @xmath11 .",
    "the uves observations imply that the turn - off in the evolution does occur at @xmath12 , not at @xmath13 as previously suggested .",
    "forest with @xmath14 .",
    "dotted lines refer to the evolution compatible with an ionising uv background due only to qsos .",
    "solid lines show the expected evolution when both qsos and galaxies contribute to the background , for models with @xmath15=0.05 ( upper line ) , 0.1 and 0.4 ( lower line ) .",
    "data points come from several observations in the literature , as given by @xcite .",
    "the modelled evolution has been normalized to the observed evolution in the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite ]    while the opacity is varying so fast , the column density distribution stays almost unchanged .",
    "the differential density distribution function measured by uves @xcite , that is the number of lines per unit redshift path and per unit @xmath17  as a function of @xmath17 , basically follows a power - law @xmath18 extending over 10 orders of magnitude with little , but significant deviations : the slope @xmath19 of the power - law in the range @xmath20 goes from about @xmath21 at @xmath22 to @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "recent hst stis data @xcite confirm that this trend continues at lower redshift , measuring a @xmath19 of @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath27 is governed by two main factors : the hubble expansion and the metagalactic uv background ( uvb ) . at high @xmath28 both the expansion ,",
    "which decreases the density and tends to increase the ionization , and the uvb , which is increasing or non - decreasing with decreasing redshift , work in the same direction and cause a steep evolution of the number of lines . at low @xmath28 ,",
    "the uvb starts to decrease with decreasing redshift , due to the reduced number and intensity of the ionizing sources , counteracting the hubble expansion . as a result",
    "the evolution of the number of lines slows down .    up to date numerical simulations",
    "@xcite have been remarkably successful in qualitatively reproducing the observed evolution , however they predict the break in the @xmath29  power - law at a redshift @xmath30 that appears too high in the light of the new uves results .",
    "this suggests that the uvb implemented in the simulations may not be the correct one : it was thought that at low redshift qsos are the main source of ionizing photons , and , since their space density drops below @xmath31 , so does the uvb .",
    "however , galaxies can produce a conspicuous ionizing flux too , possibly more significant than it was thought@xcite .",
    "the galaxy contribution can keep the uvb relatively high until at @xmath12 the global star formation rate in the universe quickly decreases , determining the qualitative change in the number density of lines .    under relatively general assumptions , it is possible to relate the observed number of lines above a given threshold in column density or equivalent width to the expansion , the uvb , the distribution in column density of the absorbers and the cosmology @xcite : @xmath32^{\\beta-1 } h^{-1}(z ) , \\label{eq : dndz}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the photoionization rate and @xmath19 the power - law index of the @xmath17  distribution .    to estimate @xmath33",
    "we have investigated the contribution of galaxies to the uvb@xcite , exploring three values for the fraction of ionizing photons that can escape the galaxy interstellar medium , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( the latter value corresponds to the lyman - continuum flux detected by @xcite in the composite spectrum of 29 lyman - break galaxies ) .",
    "measurements of the uvb based on the proximity effect at high-@xmath28 and on the @xmath36 emission in high - latitude galactic clouds at low-@xmath28 provide an upper limit on @xmath37 , consistent with recent results on individual galaxies both at low-@xmath28 @xcite and at @xmath38 @xcite . introducing a contribution of galaxies to the uvb ,",
    "the break in the ly-@xmath0  @xmath29  can be better reproduced than with a pure qso contribution @xcite .",
    "the agreement improves considerably also at @xmath39 . besides , models with @xmath40 describe the flat evolution of the absorbers much better than @xmath41 .",
    "forest as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction towards which the points move if the temperature or the ionization rate increase @xcite,,scaledwidth=105.0% ]    a consistency check is provided by the evolution of the lower column density lines .",
    "for @xmath42 the @xmath17  distribution follows a flatter slope @xmath19 , and according to eq .",
    "[ eq : dndz ] this translates directly into a slower evolutionary rate , which is consistent with the uves observations@xcite : @xmath43 .",
    "another diagnostic can be derived from the spectral shape of the uvb and its influence on the intensity ratios of metal lines @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to transform the observed column density distribution in the mass distribution of the photoionized gas ( fig .",
    "[ nhimass ] ) and interpret it , following schaye@xcite , as a function of the matter density contrast : 1 ) the flattening at @xmath44 is partly due to line crowding and partly to the turnover of the density distribution below the mean density ; 2 ) the steepening at @xmath45 , with a deficiency of lines that becomes more and more evident at lower z , reflects the fall - off in the density distribution due to the onset of rapid , non - linear collapse 3 ) the flattening at @xmath46 can be attributed to the flattening of the density distribution at density contrast @xmath47 due to the virialization of collapsed matter .",
    "the differential mass density distribution has a sort of universal form when plotted as a function of the density contrast .",
    "a given density contrast , however , corresponds to lower and lower column densities with decreasing redshift , and this causes a translation of the mass density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ nhimass ] ) towards the left with decreasing redshift , which explains the steepening of the slope @xmath19 reported in sect.2 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations successfully reproduce this behaviour , indicating that the derived matter distribution is indeed consistent with what would be expected from gravitational instability .",
    "the amount of baryons required in a given cosmological scenario to produce the observed opacity of the lyman forest can be computed @xcite under general assumptions .",
    "a lower - bound to the cosmic baryon density can be derived from the mean ly-@xmath0  flux decrement , @xmath48,@xcite and/or from the distribution of the ly-@xmath0  optical depths .",
    "the limits derived from the effective optical depths measured in the uves spectra at @xmath49 are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : omega ] .",
    "they are consistent with the bbn value for a low d / h primordial abundance .",
    "most of the baryons reside in the lyman forest at @xmath49 with little change in the contribution to @xmath50 as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , given the observed opacity , a higher uvb requires a higher @xmath51 . as pointed out by @xcite , an escape fraction as large as 0.4 , as measured by @xcite , would result in an @xmath52 in conflict either with the primordial d / h abundance or in general with the bbn or with the ly-@xmath0  opacity measurements .",

    "if the ly-@xmath0  forest is in thermal equilibrium with the metagalactic uv background , the line width of the absorption lines , described by the @xmath55 parameter of the voigt profile , is directly related to the gas temperature of the absorbing medium determined by the balance between adiabatic cooling and photo - heating : @xmath56 .",
    "additional sources of broadening exist , such as the differential hubble flow across the absorbers , peculiar motions , jeans smoothing .",
    "however , there is a lower limit to the line widths , set by the temperature of the gas , that is in principle measurable . in practice",
    "the situation is slightly more complex because for a photoionized gas there is a temperature - density relation , the so - called equation of state : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the gas temperature , @xmath59 is the gas temperature at the mean gas density , @xmath60 is the baryon over - density , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a constant which depends on the ionization history .",
    "the equation of state translates into a lower cutoff @xmath63 in the @xmath17@xmath55 distribution .",
    "the observed cut - off doppler parameter at a fixed column density of @xmath64 , @xmath65 is measured to increase with decreasing redshift , while the slope of the cutoff does not change significantly .",
    "a typical value of @xmath6618 km s@xmath67 at @xmath68 corresponds to a reference temperature of @xmath69k .",
    "this does not mean that the temperature of the igm increases with decreasing @xmath28 : on the contrary , taking into account the equation of state and the fact that a given column density corresponds to higher and higher over - densities with decreasing redshift , it turns out that the temperature at the mean density is actually decreasing with decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , evidence has been found @xcite for a general increase of the temperature around the redshift @xmath70 , attributed to the reionization of heii . temperature and ionization fluctuations",
    "are also expected due to feedback processes from the formation of galactic structures @xcite and might have been observed in correspondence of some voids in the ly-@xmath0  forest @xcite .",
