    "an example of such particles are leptoquarks ( lqs ) , colour triplet bosons which are a generic prediction of grand unified theories  @xcite , composite models  @xcite , technicolour  @xcite and supersymmetry with @xmath69-parity violation  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "particle interactions conserve lepton flavour , and if this property is extended to lq models , any such particles produced at hera would decay exclusively into a quark and a first generation lepton , namely an electron or a neutrino .",
    "dedicated searches have been performed at hera for such leptoquarks , where the sm expectation is dominated by neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) background@xcite .",
    "the introduction of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) to leptoquark models would mean the processes @xmath70 or @xmath71 , mediated by the exchange of a leptoquark , would be observable at hera with final states containing a muon or the decay products of a tau lepton in combination with a hadronic system @xmath72 .",
    "searches for such signatures have been performed at hera and limits on lfv leptoquark production have been derived  @xcite . in this paper a search for lfv phenomena is performed using @xmath7 collision data at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath1  gev , recorded during the years 1998 - 2007 by the h1 experiment at hera .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosity of @xmath2  pb@xmath3 for @xmath4 collisions and @xmath5  pb@xmath3 for @xmath6 collisions represents an increase in size of the data sample with respect to the previous publication by a factor of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",

    "some lqs , namely @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , may decay to a neutrino - quark pair resulting in the branching fraction for decays into charged leptons .",
    "since neutrino flavours can not be distinguished with the h1 experiment such final states are not included in this analysis .",
    "leptoquarks carry both lepton ( @xmath90 ) and baryon ( @xmath91 ) quantum numbers , and the fermion number is assumed to be conserved .",

    "several sm processes may mimic the lq signal .",
    "the main sm background contribution is from photoproduction events , in which a hadron is wrongly identified as a muon or a narrow hadronic jet fakes the signature of the hadronic tau decay .",
    "similarly , the scattered electron in nc dis events may also be misinterpreted as the one - prong hadronic tau decay jet .",
