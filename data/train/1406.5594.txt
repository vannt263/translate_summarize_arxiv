    "on cold surfaces ( t@xmath210k ) most species can adsorb in physisorbed states and remain trapped @xcite .",
    "if the species are reactive , some chemical transformation can occur , without help of any external agents like photons , electrons or other energetic particles .",
    "thanks to these trapping properties , cold dust particles are the nano - catalysts of cold environments . since decades , a large part of the molecular diversity observed in our universe is attributed to the catalytic role of interstellar dust.@xcite the dust can be made from carbonaceous materials , silicates and be coated with water . it is usually considered to have a temperature t@xmath220 k in most of the environments of the interstellar medium .",
    "radio - astronomy has powerful eyes able to decipher our ancient and primordial chemical history , thanks to the freeing of rotation in the gas phase .",
    "unfortunately , the birth - place of the molecular complexity is partially hidden and locked in the solid phase . for this reason , freezing and synthesis of complex molecules on micron",
    "- sized cold dust particles remain ambiguous : solid and gas phase equilibrium is still an open problem .",
    "pagani et al@xcite have shown that co and n@xmath0 species present very different depletion behaviors , in spite of their similar sticking probability and desorption efficiency.@xcite bacmann et al@xcite have observed unexpected `` high '' gas - phase abundances of large molecules like ch@xmath3och@xmath3 in very cold environments ( i.e. pre - stellar cores ) : such molecules should remain trapped on the solid phase .",
    "this is a direct ( or paradoxal ) observational evidence of the link between solid and gas phase .",
    "takahashi and williams @xcite proposed that desorption of co is induced by chemistry ; the energy released by a h+h reaction heats the grain and provokes the desorption of co from very small grains .",
    "more recently , different authors propose direct reactive desorption mechanisms.@xcite for example vasyunin and herbst@xcite include in their model a reactive desorption parameter : the efficiency of the chemical desorption process is constrained to 1 - 10@xmath1 in order to reproduce the astrophysical observations .    from a theoretical point of view , desorption upon formation has been linked to indirect mechanisms , as in the case of photo - dissociation of water,@xcite or to direct formation mechanisms , like in the case of h+h or o+h.@xcite    photo - desorption experiments have confirmed that recombinative desorption is a possible mechanism,@xcite especially in the case of irradiation of o@xmath0 and co@xmath0.@xcite moreover , rajapan et al.@xcite have shown that surface plays a fundamental part in the total efficiency of the process .",
    "the presence of a sio@xmath0 surface ( as a third body ) enhances the rate of combination of radical species ( no@xmath0 and n@xmath0o@xmath4 ) produced by photolysis , compared to the gas phase .",
    "nevertheless photo - desorption has a limited efficiency of about 1 desorption per 1000 incident photons .",
    "moreover it requires usually more energy ( typically 7 - 10 ev ) than those of chemical reactions ( @xmath2 4 ev ) and even more compared to binding energies ( @xmath2 0.4 ev ) . on the contrary , dulieu et al,@xcite by experimentally studying water formation ,",
    "show that direct chemical desorption can have an efficiency close to unity . in two previous works,@xcite",
    "we showed that the chemical desorption efficiency depends on the substrate , and it is maximized for bare surfaces .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated that the type of reaction affects chemical desorption efficiency : for example oh+h @xmath5 reaction has a very high probability of chemical desorption , while some others , like o@xmath0h+h@xmath6 , appear to not undergo chemical desorption .",
    "so far no real clues have been proposed yet to understand such differences .",
    "the chemical desorption process starts from the energy excess usually present in radical - radical reactions .",
    "chemical desorption efficiency will depend on how the newly formed molecule dissipates the energy excess .",
    "actually , in order to desorb , the molecule has to convert a fraction of this excess formation energy into kinetic energy , and especially into motion perpendicular to the substrate . in other words ,",
    "the problem lies on how the newly formed molecule manages the energy excess and interacts dynamically with the surface .",
    "the total budget of energy excess ( enthalpy of reaction ) is the most important parameter describing the chemical desorption .",
    "the larger is the enthalpy of reaction , the more probable is chemical desorption .",
    "in addition , the binding energy of the newly formed species should be considered as a limiting factor . among different parameters ,",
    "the degrees of freedom of newly formed molecules seem to play a important role : in fact more degrees of freedom lead to an easier distribution to internal modes and thus dissipation .",
    "the last parameter that we consider is the interaction with the substrate , namely the phonon propagation .",
    "water ice substrate has larger capabilities to dissipate the excess of energy than other substrates ( silicates and oxidized graphite ) , and therefore the probability of chemical desorption is lower . nevertheless , the `` softness '' of water ice substrate is not sufficient to forbid chemical desorption , as shown in amiaud et al@xcite and govers et al@xcite in the case of h@xmath0 .",
    "further works stress - in the case of water - the role of the surface coverage in the inhibition of the chemical desorption process.@xcite    the aim of this article is to describe the role and the contribution of the different parameters influencing the chemical desorption .",
    "we have chosen to present the case of o atom reactivity on oxidized graphite for two reasons .",
    "first , o atoms reactivity is a well known system,@xcite and , since only 2 reactions are involved : @xmath7 @xmath8 we can immediately realize how the different parameters affect the two reactions .",
    "second , among substrates already studied , the oxidized graphite exhibits the highest chemical desorption efficiency .",

    "experiments take place in an ultra - high vacuum chamber ( base pressure 10@xmath9 mbar ) , containing the hopg sample ( 0.9  cm in diameter ) stuck on the copper finger of the cryostat , operating at temperatures between 6.5  k and 350  k.    the temperature of the sample ( t@xmath10 ) is computer - controlled , by a calibrated silicon - diode and a thermocouple ( aufe / chrome l k - type ) clamped on the sample holder .",

    "the blue straight line corresponds to the conservation of the total number of o atoms : if all the atoms ( in the form of o , o@xmath0 , and o@xmath3 ) desorb during the tpd , therefore the triangles should overlie this line .",
    "this line is made experimentally using the undissociated beam ( pure o@xmath0 beam ) .",
    "we did not detect any signal that could be interpreted as o - atom desorption in the gas phase during the tpd , and the sum o@xmath0+o@xmath3 does not fit the blue line , in contrast to what is observed on a water substrate.@xcite the large deficit in o atoms is due to the reactive desorption or `` chemical desorption '' .",
    "the excess of chemical energy of the newly formed molecule is partly transferred to kinetic energy ( by bounce on the substrate ) , and desorption may occur . we can also remark on fig .",

    "there is a rather vertical shift up .",
    "this shift illustrates two facts : ( i ) the o@xmath0 production saturates because o@xmath0 molecules are transformed into o@xmath3 molecules by new incoming o atoms ; ( ii ) the larger the coverage , the lower the chemical desorption efficiency .",
    "we want to stress that for increasing doses we need to increase exposure times , keeping the flux of the atomic beam constant .",
    "the measurement is made at the end of the exposure , but the coverage evolves during the exposure phase .",
    "an experimental point does not represent a constant coverage , but the evolution from zero to the final coverage .",
    "actually , our experiments represent integration over the time of events . from the stars in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , it is clear that chemical desorption efficiency is reduced with the coverage , but the used experimental method partly conceals the correlation between the coverage and the chemical desorption , because the coverage is not the parameter directly varied .",
    "for this reason we perform a second set of experiments .",
    "this time , while keeping constant the dose ( 0.5  ml ) - using the same evolution of the coverage ( at first approximation ) - we increment the surface temperature for different experiments from 8 to 25  k ( above which o@xmath0 starts to desorb ) .",

    "and @xmath23 are the chemical desorption probability of ( r1 ) and ( r2 ) respectively.,width=325 ]    to analyze our experimental result , we can consider how the populations of species adsorbed on the substrate evolve with time ( or coverage ) .",
    "in particular , there are three populations evolving with the deposited dose : o(t ) , o@xmath0(t ) , and o@xmath3(t ) .",
    "however , we are only able to measure o@xmath0 ( t@xmath29 ) and o@xmath3(t@xmath29 ) final populations , represented through grey circles on fig .  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the evolution of populations has two origins : external incoming fluxes of o and o@xmath0 molecules ( represented by broad arrows ) , and chemical evolution of the populations .",
    "o atoms undergo the two reactions ( r1 ) and ( r2 ) .",
    "the branching ratio between ( r1 ) and ( r2 ) is expressed by the parameter @xmath30 . if @xmath30=1 , only ( r1 ) takes place , if @xmath30=0 , only ( r2 ) takes place .",
    "clearly the balance between the two reactions is dependent on populations , so from one experiment to another , and even during any given experiment , @xmath30 varies ranging always between 0 and 1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 describes the chemical desorption of ( r1 ) , and the parameter @xmath23 describes the chemical desorption of ( r2 ) . if @xmath31=1 , all the o@xmath0 formed via o+o reactions steadily desorb .",
    "parameters @xmath31 and @xmath23 actually describe the chemical desorption process .",
    "we now write the o@xmath0(t@xmath29 ) population , composed of the three following parts :    * the contribution from the undissociated part of the beam : @xmath32 * the contribution of ( r1 ) ( o part of the beam ) less the part that has undertaken chemical desorption : @xmath33 * the subtraction due to ( r2 ) . here",

    "the share of energy available for the motion perpendicular to the surface ( required for desorption ) is more limited in the case of o@xmath3 .",
    "so the energy available for desorption favors chemical desorption of o@xmath0 .",

    "_ mass of newly formed molecule_. it may have an indirect impact on the chemical desorption .",
    "actually , phonon propagation is dependent on the mass of the colliding molecule with the surface .",

    "these experiments show the importance of the coverage from a different point of view . following our previous analysis",
    "we could expect that chemical desorption vanishes exactly at one ml , due to the similar masses of o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 as in the case of o@xmath0 and o@xmath3 .",
    "a small deviation from this behavior has been observed , that could be attributed to the flux calibration uncertainty , but it is more likely related to the energy transfer .",
    "the energy transfer is not only a kinetic energy transfer influenced by mass , but it is a complex ro - vibrational exchange .",
    "previously , we have shown that the detection of excited d@xmath0 molecules , ejected from an ice surface upon d recombination , disappears if the surface is before covered with a layer of d@xmath0.@xcite it is an evidence that internal energy of molecules is also exchanged between co - adsorbates . in the case of d@xmath0 , however , it is not possible to know if the molecules released in the gas phase are directly involved in reactions , or simply desorbed from thermal desorption due to surface coverage increase . in the present case , we can see if n@xmath0 molecules are ejected after having absorbed energy from ( r1 ) and ( r2 ) reactions .",
    "this is not the case : n@xmath0 desorption yield remains the same with or without oxygen reactions .",
    "n@xmath0 is clearly absorbing a part of chemical energy , although , it is not converting it efficiently into desorption .",
    "we can conclude that the indirect chemical desorption process is inefficient , within our 5  % experimental error bars .",
    "moreover , desorption can not be a direct mechanism because the initial total translational momentum is very weak ( both atoms are thermalized with the substrate ) .",
    "therefore , desorption happens after at least one bounce on a third body and so after a ro - vibrational and kinetic energy exchange .",
    "after the collision , the energy is spread again inside the molecule modes or transferred to the collider . around 41  kj / mol ( for r1 ) of the energy",
    "is used for one of the dimensions of kinetic energy , if the initial chemical energy is shared equally between the degrees of freedom . hence , even if the energy transfer to the surface is important and only 36  % of the energy is kept by the reactive product , there are still 15  kj / mol of energy for ( r1 ) to compare with 10  kj / mol of binding energy .",
    "this can explain why the chemical desorption in case of ( r1 ) is high on a bare and rigid surface .",
    "on the contrary , for ( r2 ) , only about 2.5  kj / mol of energy is available to overcome the 17.5  kj / mol energy barrier .",
    "this can explain the low chemical desorption efficiency for ( r2 ) .",
    "in the case of the bounce on a adsorbed molecule , neither the newly formed o@xmath0 molecule nor the impacted molecule have a chance to desorb : the first one transfers all the chemical energy to the second one ; this last dissipates energy in its own internal degrees of freedom . by colliding with a physisorbed molecule",
    "ro - vibrational energy is shared between all the degrees of freedom of both the two molecules , and so the desorption probability is greatly reduced for both molecules .     and",
    "o@xmath3 tpd traces after deposition of 0.5  ml of o+o@xmath0 on a bare oxidized graphite sample .",
    "red curve : o@xmath0 and o@xmath3 tpd traces after deposition of 0.5  ml of o+o@xmath0 on 1  ml of n@xmath0 previously deposited on a oxidized graphite.,width=325 ]     ( black squares ) , o@xmath3 ( red circles ) and their sum ( green triangles ) obtained after 0.5  ml of beam exposure in function of the dose of n@xmath0 molecules previously deposited on the oxidized graphite sample .",
    "dark green line corresponds to no chemical desorption.,width=325 ]    mass and energy transfer argumentations are able to depict the observed facts ; nevertheless they present some limits and theoretical studies are needed to clarify how energy partition takes place .",
    "recently , fayolle et al@xcite have studied the photo - desorption of o@xmath0 using an isotopic mixture of @xmath48o@xmath0 and @xmath49o@xmath0 .",
    "they have observed @xmath49o@xmath48o desorption , putting in evidence that the o+o reaction takes place .",
    "recombinative desorption is an efficient channel of photo - desorption of o@xmath0 , but it is not the only one .",
    "these experiments are performed with 60 layers of o@xmath0 , and we wonder why this mechanism does not vanish due to the high coverage like in our experiments . actually the total yield is low , 5@xmath1410@xmath50 molecules per photons ( 9  ev photons ) at the maximum .",
    "we have to consider that photons are not able to induce desorption ( it is only possible for the first three layers ) in the deeper part of the matrix .",
    "for this reason , we can multiply by one order of magnitude , and we still obtain a very optimistic efficiency of about 5 % .",
    "we note that our detection limit is about few @xmath1 and it is compatible with such a value .",
    "moreover , in the case of photo - desorption , o atoms formed through photon absorption have certainly important kinetic energies , due to a higher energy budget ; therefore they can react with a non negligible total momentum , on the contrary of what is presented in this paper .",
    "moreover , for the case of photo - desorption , the role of vibrational relaxation is central,@xcite which is also possible in our case , even if we have no experimental information about it .",
    "it is therefore difficult to compare directly experiments of photo - desorption and chemical desorption , even using the same studied molecule .",
    "unfortunately in our case , we do not have any spectroscopic information and are only sensitive to overall effects .",
    "detection of chemical desorption coupled with laser spectroscopy would provide very useful insight for the problem .",
    "it would teach us if the momentum transfer we used here is a sufficient tool to depict correctly the problem , or more certainly if detailed relaxation to others bodies ( adsorbates or substrate ) has to be treated for all the degrees of freedom .",
    "however since the details of the energy transfer at play is not yet known , our aim here was to illuminate the role of surface coverage in chemical desorption process .",
    "in this paper we have shown how surface coverage influences chemical desorption process , by presenting the case of oxygen reactivity on oxidized graphite .",
    "it is a system with only two open channels of reactions leading to o@xmath0 and o@xmath3 .",
    "thanks to these two observables , it is possible to constrain the chemical desorption efficiency . we have shown that    * reaction o+o@xmath51o@xmath0 is the main carrier of the oxygen loss via chemical desorption ; the probability of chemical desorption is 80@xmath1 on a bare surface ; * reaction o+o@xmath0 @xmath51o@xmath3 leads to only few percent of the gas phase products .    we have shown that these findings are explained by referring essentially to 4 physical parameters of the reaction : ( 1 ) exothermicity of reaction , ( 2 ) mass , ( 3 ) degrees of freedom , and ( 4 ) binding energy of products .",
    "+ moreover , through these parameters , we are able to explain the surface coverage dependence of chemical desorption . the presence of a pre - adsorbed species enhances the probability for the newly formed excited molecules to dissipate their excess energy ; in other words chemical desorption decreases with surface coverage increase .",
    "finally , we think that the relation between the masses of newly formed species and pre - adsorbed species is a key parameter : the more similar their masses , the higher the energy transfer ( lower the chemical desorption ) , and viceversa . as a side effect ,",
    "indirect cd is unlikely .",
    "these results represent a further step to understand how gas and solid phase are coupled in cold environments .",
    "the energy excess of the reaction between two radicals physisorbed on a cold surface can lead to the desorption of the products , even if the temperature of the substrate is low enough to keep them physisorbed .",
    "molecular dynamic simulations will be able to investigate in more detail the energy partition of newly formed molecules .",
