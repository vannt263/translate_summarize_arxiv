    "since the first discoveries @xcite , the number of known extra - solar planets has been rapidly increasing and it reaches @xmath2 ( http://exoplanet.eu : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a significant fraction of these planets are members of multi - planet systems @xcite , which were mostly discovered by the radial - velocity and transit methods .",
    "multi - planet systems can also be detected by using the microlensing method .",
    "gravitational microlensing occurs by the chance alignment along the line of sight toward a background star ( source ) and a foreground object ( lens ) , resulting in the magnification of the source brightness due to the bending of light by the gravity of the lens .",
    "when a lensing object is a star accompanied by a planet , the planet causes astigmatism in the bending of light and induces formation of caustics which refers to the envelope of light rays on the source plane at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinity .",
    "a planetary lensing signal occurs when the source approaches caustics and it appears as a short term anomaly superposed on the smooth and symmetric lensing light curve of the host star @xcite .",
    "if a planetary system is composed of multiple planets , each planet induces its own caustics and the multiplicity of the planets can be identified if the source trajectory passes multiple caustics induced by the individual planets @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to multiple planets for general microlensing events is low because planet - induced caustics are small and thus the geometrical probability for the source to pass multiple caustics is low .",
    "however , the sensitivity is high for a subset of lensing events where the brightness of a source star is greatly magnified @xcite .",
    "this is because one of the caustics induced by each planet is always located very close to the host star around which the source of a high - magnification event passes by @xcite .",
    "indeed , two multi - planet systems identified by microlensing @xcite were discovered through this channel .",
    "microlensing discoveries of multi - planet systems are important for better understanding of planet - formation mechanism . according to the core accretion theory @xcite ,",
    "giant planets are believed to form in group in the region beyond the snow line where the lower temperature in this region makes many more solid grains available for accretion into planetesimals .",
    "however , most known planets in multiple systems reside well within the snow line .",
    "these close - in planets are believed to have migrated from the outer region where they were formed @xcite .",
    "detecting planets at their birth places by using the transit and the radial - velocity methods is difficult due to their low sensitivity to wide - separation planets .",
    "by contrast , microlensing is sensitive to planets located around and beyond the snow line and thus provides a channel to study planets where they formed .    in this work ,",
    "we reanalyze the light curves of the eight high - magnification microlensing events for each of which a single planet was previously detected . from the analyses",
    ", we investigate the existence of additional planets .",

    "the host has a low - mass companion with @xmath34 @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "] we exclude the events with already - known multi - planet systems and circum - stellar binary planets from our analysis .",
    "second , we choose events with good coverage of the peak region .",
    "this is because signatures of multiple planets for high - magnification events show up near the peak of a light curve and thus good coverage of the peak region is essential to constrain additional planets .",
    "third , we confine analysis to events for which there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the known planetary signals .",

    "[ table : one ] , we list the lensing events that we analyzed . also presented are the peak magnifications @xmath38 of the individual events , the physical parameters ( mass and separation from the host ) of the previously discovered planets , and the references of the original analyses . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the light curves of the events .",
    "we note that the same data sets as those used in the original analysis are used in our analysis for the consistency of results .",
    "in order to investigate the existence of an additional planet for a lensing event with an already known planet , it is required to conduct triple - lens modeling . for a triple - lens system ,",
    "the image positions for given locations of the lens and source are found by solving the equation of lens mapping ( lens equation ) that is expressed as @xmath39 here @xmath401 , 2 , and 3 denote the individual lens components , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the complex notations of the source , lens , and image positions , respectively , @xmath44 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the mass fraction of each lens component @xcite .",
    "once the image locations are found , the lensing magnification is computed by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the magnification of each image .",
    "due to non - linearity , the lens equation for a triple lens system can not be analytically solved . however , lensing magnifications can be numerically computed by using the method known as the inverse ray - shooting method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a large number of rays are uniformly shot from the image plane , bent by the lens equation , and land on the source plane .",
    "then , lensing magnifications are computed as the ratio of the number density of rays on the source plane to that on the image plane .",
    "the lens equation can also be solved semi - analytically because the equation is expressed as a tenth - order polynomial in @xmath45 and the image positions and subsequent lensing magnifications are computed by solving the polynomial @xcite .",
    "the semi - analytic method has an advantage of fast computation but it is difficult to be used for computing lensing magnifications affected by finite - source effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical method can be used to compute finite - source magnifications but computation is slow .",
    "describing the light curve of a triple - lensing event requires ten basic parameters .",
    "the first three of these parameters describe how the source approaches the lens .",
    "they are the time of the closest source approach to a reference position of the lens system , @xmath49 , the normalized projected separation between the source and the lens reference position at that moment , @xmath50 , and the einstein time scale , @xmath51 , that is defined as the time required for the source to cross the angular einstein radius of the lens @xmath52 .",
    "another six parameters characterize the lens system .",
    "they are the projected separations between the host and the individual planet companions , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the mass ratios of the companions to the host , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the angle between the source trajectory and the axis connecting the host and the first planet , @xmath57 , and the orientation angle of the second planet with respect to the host - first planet axis , @xmath58 .",
    "we note that length scales describing lensing phenomenon are usually expressed in units of @xmath52 and @xmath50 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are normalized by @xmath52 .",
    "the last parameter is the angular size of the source @xmath59 in unit of the einstein radius , @xmath60 ( normalized source radius ) .",
    "this parameter is needed to describe light curve deviations affected by finite - source effects .",
    "besides the basic lensing parameters , precise description of lensing light curves often requires additional parameters to account for higher - order effects .",
    "one such effect is caused by the positional change of an observer induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun . considering this parallax effect",
    "@xcite requires two additional parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 that represent the two components of the lens parallax vector @xmath63 projected on the sky in the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively .",
    "similarly , lensing light curves can also be affected by the change of the lens position caused by the orbital motion @xcite .    with the lensing parameters , we conduct triple - lens modeling of the events that were previously analyzed based on binary - lens modeling . for all analyzed events ,",
    "the anomaly is dominated by the signal of the already reported planet and thus the signal of the potential additional planet would be small .",
    "we , therefore , set the lensing parameters related to the known planet @xmath64 fixed as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the existence of an additional planet is then inspected by checking whether the two - planet model improves the fit with respect to the single - planet model .",
    "not knowing the characteristics of the second planet , we search for the second - planet parameters @xmath54 and @xmath56 by inspecting solutions in wide ranges of the parameter space spanning @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "for a given set of @xmath67 , the other lensing parameters are searched for by minimizing @xmath68 in the parameter space using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm .    for computing triple - lensing magnifications , we apply both the semi - analytic and numerical methods . for the region near the peak of the light curve ,",
    "we use the numerical inverse ray - shooting method because this region is likely to be affected by finite - source effects during the source star s approach close to the planet - induced caustics . for other regions ,",
    "we use the semi - analytic method for fast computation . computing finite - source magnifications",
    "is further accelerated by applying the `` map making '' method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a map of rays for a given set of @xmath64 and @xmath67 is constructed based on the inverse ray shooting method and then it is used to produce many different light curves resulting from various source trajectories without producing extra maps . in computing finite - source magnifications , we consider limb - darkening variation of the source star surface brightness by modeling the surface brightness profile as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the limb - darkening coefficients corresponding to specific passband @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the angle between the line of sight toward the source star and the normal to the source surface .",
    "we use the same limb - darkening coefficients that were used in the previous analyses where first planets were reported .",
    "if higher - order effects were reported in the previous analyses , we also consider them .",
    "parallax effects were reported for events ogle-2005-blg-071 , moa-2009-blg-387 , and moa-2010-blg-477 .",
    "on the other hand , obvious effect of lens - orbital motion was reported for none of the events .",
    "we note that the effect of an additional planet is confined to the narrow region of the light curve peak while both parallax and lens - orbital effects influence the overall shape of a lensing light curve .",
    "therefore , the existence of the second planet does not affect the lensing parameters of higher - order effects .",
    "table [ table : two ] shows the result of the analysis presented as @xmath68 values of the binary and triple lens models . from the comparison of the @xmath68 values , it is found that including an additional planet improves fits with @xmath0 for seven out of the eight analyzed events . for moa-2009-blg-319 ,",
