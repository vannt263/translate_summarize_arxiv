    "rapid x - ray variability is a ubiquitous characteristic of accretion onto black holes .",
    "aperiodic x - ray fluctuations are seen from both galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and , accounting for the inverse scaling of all relevant frequencies with black hole mass , appear to have similar characteristics ( uttley , mchardy & vaughan 2005 ; mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) . while it is highly tempting to relate this variability to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence that is believed to drive the accretion process ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) , the exact physical processes underlying the observed fluctuations remain mysterious .",
    "gbhbs also display quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in their x - ray lightcurves ( see review by mcclintock & remillard 2003 )",
    ". of particular interest are the high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) that are seen in the very - high ( or steep power law ; mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) state of gbhbs .",
    "the hfqpos have quality factors of few - to-@xmath1 , centroid frequencies of order @xmath2 and appear to be imprinted on the hard x - ray tail of the spectrum rather than the thermal disk emission .",
    "the fact that their frequencies are stable and at least loosely comparable to the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) around the black hole suggests that their properties are set by the relativistic portions of the gravitational potential .",
    "this gives them enormous promise as a diagnostic of black hole mass and spin .",
    "however , the utility of hfqpos to relativistic astrophysics is severely limited by the lack of a compelling theoretical framework in which to interpret measurements of the frequencies , quality factors and root - mean - square ( rms ) powers . there",
    "exist well defined geodesic frequencies ( i.e. , the orbital , radial epicyclic and vertical epicyclic frequencies ) at any given radius in the accretion disk .",
    "however , these frequencies ( as well as all non - trivial linear combinations ) change with radius , and it is not clear why the frequencies of any one particular radius would be preferentially displayed in the overall power - spectrum .",
    "hfqpos are commonly found in pairs with an approximate 3:2 frequency ratio , and this has been used to suggest that a particular radius is picked out due to a resonance . in the parametric resonance model ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 , 2003 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , there is a resonance in the disk at the radius where the radial epicyclic frequency and vertical epicyclic frequency are in small integer ratios . as discussed below",
    ", the strongest resonance occurs when these frequencies are in 3:2 ratio , at least in the simplest manifestation of this model .",
    "other resonance models have been examined by rezzolla et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) and kato ( 2004a , b , c ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the hfqpos are global oscillation modes of the accretion disk ( i.e. , `` diskoseismic '' modes ) .",
    "global modes have been examined analytically ( using linear theory ) on a hydrodynamic background in spacetimes that are pseudo - newtonian ( okazaki , kato , & fukue 1987 ; nowak & wagoner 1991 , 1992 , 1993 ; markovi & lamb 1998 ) , schwarzschild ( kato & fukue 1980 ) , and kerr ( kato 1990 , 1991 , 1993 ; kato & honma 1991 ; perez et al .",
    "1997 ; silbergleit et al . 2001 ; wagoner et al . 2001 ; ortega - rodriguez et al . 2001 ) .",
    "three classes of mode are recovered corresponding to pressure modes ( p - modes ) , inertial modes ( conventionally referred to as g - modes even though the restoring force results from rotation or inertia , depending on your frame of reference ; j.pringle priv .",
    "communication ) and warping / corrugation modes ( c - modes ) . for plausible masses and spins , the fundamental ( @xmath3 ) g - mode",
    "was quickly identified as a good candidate for the first hfqpo discovered , the 67hz oscillation found in the system grs  1915@xmath4105 ( nowak et al .",
    "current diskoseismology theory does not provide a natural explanation of hfqpo pairs with small - integer ratios ; however , all present analyses are conducted using linear theory whereas these hfqpos pairs would likely arise from mode - coupling that would only be revealed by a non - linear analysis .    clearly",
    ", many open questions concerning the physics of x - ray variability remain , including the correct interpretation of hfqpos .",
    "the current dominant paradigm for understanding black hole accretion is that the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) drives powerful mhd turbulence , and correlated maxwell stresses within this turbulence mediate the outward transport of angular momentum that allows accretion to proceed .",
    "however , the connection between the mhd turbulence paradigm and models for the aperiodic and quasi - periodic variability remains highly uncertain .",
    "for example , can the mhd turbulence naturally produce the rms - flux relation noted in most black hole x - ray lightcurves ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ) and/or the log - normal flux distribution found in cygnus x-1 ( uttley , mchardy & vaughan 2005 ) ?",
    "are diskoseismic modes excited by turbulent fluctuation ( nowak & wagoner 1993 ) , or does the turbulence act to damp such modes ( arras , blaes & turner 2006 ) ?",
    "do the maxwell stresses couple radial and vertical motions in such a way as to excite parametric resonance instabilities of the type identified by abramowicz & kluniak ( 2001 ) or any other resonant phenomena ? does the fact that the hfqpos are imprinted on the high - energy tail provide a fundamental clue to their origin , or is it a generic consequence of any oscillating thermal accretion disk surrounded by a comptonizing corona ( lehr , wagoner & wilms 2000 ) ?    in this paper , we use a set of global hydrodynamic and mhd simulations of geometrically - thin accretion disks in a pseudo - newtonian potential to begin an exploration of these issues .",
    "our canonical mhd simulation represents a thinner disk , and is run for more orbits , than any previously published well - resolved 3-d mhd disk simulation .",
    "this allows us to conduct a more extensive study of the temporal variability of such disks than has previously been attempted . in   2 , we give a brief review of the theory of both local and global hydrodynamic modes of black hole accretion disks , as well as the parametric resonance instability model for hfqpos .",
    "  3 presents our study of ideal ( inviscid ) hydrodynamic disks , both with imposed axisymmetry and in full 3-dimensions .",
    "we find prominent trapped g - modes in the axisymmetric simulations which remain ( albeit with diminished amplitude ) in the full 3-d case .",
    "we then study the mhd case in   4 , where we find that the turbulence excites neither the diskoseismic modes nor the parametric resonances discussed above .",
    "instead , we find that the turbulence excites local hydrodynamic waves of the type elucidated by lubow & pringle ( 1993 ) .",
    "we discuss our results , including a comparison to previous work , in   5 and",
    "conclude in ",
    "here we provide a brief review of some previously established theoretical results that are pertinent to this paper .",
    "there is a very extensive literature on oscillations and waves in accretion disks .",
    "here we focus on just those aspects of the field that turn out to be relevant for the interpretation of our simulation which have been elucidated most clearly by lubow & pringle ( 1993 ) .",
    "lubow & pringle ( 1993 ; hereafter lp93 ) studied three dimensional wave propagation in accretion disks ignoring self - gravity . in the case where one ignores vertical motions ,",
    "they show that radial waves obey the well - known dispersion relation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sound speed ( assumed , in this case , to be purely a function of @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the radial epicyclic frequency given by @xmath9 ( also see binney & tremaine 1987 ) . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the angular frequency of the background keplerian flow .",
    "lp93 proceed to study the propagation of axisymmetric waves in the case where the atmosphere has a locally isothermal vertical structure .",
    "they find two types of waves .",
    "there are low - frequency gravity waves for which @xmath11 there are also high - frequency acoustic waves which have @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the adiabatic index . in the special case of purely vertical perturbations , the inequality becomes an equality , @xmath15 the @xmath16 mode corresponds to a bulk vertical displacement of the disk and subsequent vertical oscillation at the vertical epicyclic frequency which , in the analysis of lp93 and in all analyses performed in this paper , coincides with the orbital frequency . in general",
    ", the @xmath17 mode has @xmath18 vertical nodes ( i.e. , locations where the vertical velocity perturbation vanishes ) , and is either even or odd depending on whether @xmath18 is even or odd , respectively .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : mhd ] , our simulations demonstrate the effectiveness with which mhd turbulence excites these local acoustic waves .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , several groups have studied the global oscillation of black hole accretion disks using linear perturbation theory , identifying three classes of normal mode ( @xmath19-modes , @xmath20-modes and @xmath21-modes ) .",
    "trapped @xmath19-modes have received particular attention as a possible source of hfqpo , although the other families of modes may well be relevant . here",
    "we review some of the basic results of these analyses , following the approach of nowak & wagoner ( 1991 , 1992 ; hereafter nw91 and nw92 ) .",
    "the nw91 and nw92 analyses are not fully relativistic , instead employing a pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "thus , these analyses can be readily compared with our pseudo - newtonian simulations .",
    "we also note that full general relativistic mhd simulations have typically yielded results for slowly rotating black holes that are very similar to those obtained with pseudo - newtonian potentials ( e.g. , gammie , mckinney , & tth 2003 ; de  villiers & hawley 2003 ) .",
    "nw91 and nw92 use a lagrangian formalism ( friedman & schutz 1978 ) and a wkbj approximation to derive the linearized equations describing perturbations of an inviscid hydrodynamic thin accretion accretion disk about a pure keplerian background state .",
    "they also initially examined the special case of purely radial oscillations and found the standard dispersion relation of disk theory ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : disk_dispersion ] ) . given that the gravity - modified @xmath20-modes described by this dispersion relation become evanescent when @xmath22 , global @xmath20-modes can be trapped between the isco ( where @xmath23 ) and the radius at which @xmath24 . in practice , however , the `` leaky '' nature of the isco would seem to make the trapping of these modes ineffective .    the more general case , including perturbations that have vertical as well as radial motions , yields more promising results .",
    "nw92 examine the linearized equations describing the behavior of the scalar potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the eulerian variation in the pressure .",
    "they show that the linearized equations are approximately separable into radial and vertical equations , with the separation constant being a slowly varying function of @xmath7 , @xmath27 .",
    "the general dispersion relation for these modes becomes @xmath28(\\omega^2-\\kappa^2)=\\omega^2c_s^2k^2\\ ; .\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath29 , non - evanescent solutions exist for @xmath30 ( predominantly radial @xmath20-modes ) or @xmath22 ( predominantly vertical @xmath19-modes ) . through this analysis ,",
    "nw92 identify a class of global @xmath19-modes that are trapped between two evanescent regions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , these modes are trapped under the peak of the epicyclic frequency .",
    "they principally focus on the @xmath3 ( axisymmetric ) modes , and show that the mode frequency is only _ slightly _ smaller than the maximum radial epicyclic frequency @xmath34 .",
    "radial harmonics of these modes are very closely spaced .",
    "thus , the inner radius at which the mode becomes evanescent is still a finite distance ( and , in plausible settings , several vertical scale heights ) from the isco .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility of having appreciable power in such modes without significant leakage across the isco .    a major issue , however , is the effect of the turbulent mhd background state on these modes .",
    "the diskoseismic mode frequencies are comparable to the frequencies characterizing the expected mhd turbulent fluctuations ( which is very different to the situation in the sun , for example , where the observed helioseismic modes have frequencies that are four orders of magnitude higher than the turbulent turnover frequency ) .",
    "thus , an mhd turbulent disk is likely to be a hostile environment for any diskoseismic modes .",
    "furthermore , magnetic forces can lead to a rather gradual transition in flow properties around the isco , potentially worsening the leakage of the trapped g - modes . considering these mode destruction / suppression mechanisms ,",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that mode survival becomes easier in thinner disks since ( 1 ) the ratio of the typical turbulent cell size to the radial extent of the resonant cavity will decrease with disk thickness and ( 2 ) there are suggestions that the transition in flow properties around the isco is sharper in thinner disks ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ; shafee et al .",
    "2008 ) thereby producing less mode leakage .",
    "this raises the possibility that a @xmath19-mode can be sustained against ( or even fed by ; nowak & wagoner 1993 ) the turbulence in a sufficiently thin disk .",
    "previously published global mhd disk simulations ( e.g. , hawley & krolik 2001 ) have modeled flows as thin as @xmath35 and have not reported diskoseismic modes . however , these authors did not conduct a directed search for such modes and hence it is not possible to say that the modes were really not present .",
    "careful examination of local `` shearing - box '' simulations have indeed failed to find trapped @xmath19-modes associated with mhd turbulence ( arras , blaes & turner 2006 ) , but this issue has yet to be examined in a global thin - disk setting .",
    "searching for and characterizing these trapped @xmath19-modes in global thin - disk simulations will be a major theme of our paper .      from the point of view of explaining hfqpos ,",
    "the need for global oscillation modes is diminished if some process does indeed select special radii in the accretion disk . as discussed in the introduction , the discovery of pairs of hfqpos with small integer ratios has prompted several groups to examine resonance models .",
    "in particular , we shall briefly review the parametric resonance model of abramowicz & kluniak ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 , 2003 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "we begin by considering an accretion disk in which the flow deviates only slightly from keplerian so that the position of a fluid element ( in spherical polar coordinates ) is given by @xmath36 we have specialized to the case of axisymmetric perturbations . by expanding the resulting equations of motion to third order ( and wrapping up the non - gravitational forces into two unspecified force functions ) , one finds a mathieu - type equation of motion @xmath37\\delta\\theta + \\lambda\\,\\delta\\theta_{,\\,t}=0 , \\label{eq : mathieu}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a small constant that describes the coupling between the vertical and radial perturbations , and @xmath39 is a ( small ) damping constant . here , we have specialized the equations of abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter a2003 ) to the case where the vertical epicyclic frequency is the same as the orbital frequency .",
    "this is valid for a non - spinning black hole and , in particular , the pseudo - newtonian potential that we use for the simulations in this paper .",
    "one expects a system described by eqn .",
    "[ eq : mathieu ] to exhibit a parametric resonance instability when @xmath40 , where @xmath18 is a non - zero positive integer .",
    "given that black hole potentials always have @xmath41 , the smallest value of @xmath18 for which the resonance condition is obeyed is @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "this is expected to be the strongest of the set of resonances .",
    "it is interesting that the fundamental `` test - particle '' frequencies at this resonant radius have 3:2 frequency ratio in agreement with observations of hfqpo pairs . for the paczynski - wiita pseudo - newtonian potential we use in our simulations ( paczynski & wiita 1980 , hereafter pw ) , @xmath44 we have @xmath45 and , @xmath46 hence , the 3:2 resonance occurs at @xmath47 .",
    "it must be noted , however , that a full integration of a toy - problem by a2003 reveals that higher - order effects shift the location of the resonance , making the ratio of the epicyclic frequencies extremely sensitive to the strength of the coupling between the @xmath7 and @xmath48 perturbations . while a2003 suggest that this sensitivity is a strength of the model , allowing application to hfqpo pairs in neutron star systems which do not have simple integer ratios , it inevitably diminishes the power of this model to explain black hole systems .",
    "in addition , there is currently no physical model of the coupling between the radial and vertical motions .",
    "the simulations described in this paper allow us to assess whether magnetic forces couple these motions in such a way as to drive a parametric resonance instability .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we construct and analyze numerical simulations of thin disks in order to examine their variability properties , focusing on the presence of local and global modes , as well as parametric resonances .",
    "of course , real accretion disks are believed to require at least an mhd - level description in order to capture the mri - driven turbulence that transports angular momentum and drives accretion .",
    "mhd simulations are addressed in the next section .",
    "however , it is useful to begin with a discussion of ideal hydrodynamic models in order to help isolate the various physical effects present in these complex systems",
    ". that will be the focus of this section .    in order to allow us to perform a set of simulations with modest - to - high resolution",
    ", we begin with 2-d ( axisymmetric ) hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we expect ( and indeed show ) that these axisymmetric models are well suited for studying the fundamental @xmath3 g - mode . however , once we move to mhd , cowling s anti - dynamo theorem ( cowling 1957 ) leads to qualitatively different behavior in axisymmetric compared with full 3-d simulations . hence , all of the mhd models that we shall describe are performed in 3-dimensions .",
    "since we will be directly comparing results ( e.g. , @xmath19-mode amplitudes ) between the hydrodynamic and mhd simulations , we also need to perform a `` bridging '' 3-d hydrodynamic simulation .      to make the problem tractable despite the severe resolution requirements imposed by the geometrical thinness of the accretion disk , we choose to focus on only the most essential aspects of the physics . from the discussion in ",
    "2 , it is clear that the essential aspect of the relativistic potential that must be captured is the nature of the radial epicyclic frequency ( e.g. , that it goes to zero at some finite radius and hence produces an isco at that radius ) . in this sense , the pw potential ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : pw_pot ] ) is a good approximation for the gravitational field of a non - rotating black hole ; its isco ( at @xmath49 ) and marginally bound orbit ( at @xmath50 ) are both at the same radius as in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "we also simplify the simulations by neglecting all radiation processes ( radiative heating , radiative cooling , radiative transfer , and the dynamical effects of radiation pressure ) . in place of a full energy equation , the gas is given an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath51 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from this analysis , we find compelling evidence for a break in the power law characterizing the psd of @xmath52 . compared to a single power law , the broken power fit is better by @xmath53 , hence the maximum likelihood ratio is at least @xmath54 in all three data segments independently .",
    "the break frequency and power law slopes are consistent between the second and third data segments , but these do not match the first data segment .",
    "the break frequencies are within a factor of two of , but not consistent with , the orbital frequency at the isco , @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , although there is a clear steepening in the power density spectrum , it is not possible at this point to assign a specific physical meaning to the break .",
    "we note that this general form of the psd , i.e. , an approximate power - law with curvature or a break at frequencies close to the isco orbital frequency , has been previously seen in the mass accretion rate of global disk simulations ( hawley & krolik 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "we see no indications of qpos in the @xmath56 psd .",
    "quantitatively , we add a lorentzian qpo to the broken power - law psd model in which the qpo centroid frequency , full - width half - maximum , and amplitude are allowed to be free parameters , with the one restriction that the quality factor of the qpo must exceed 2 .",
    "we find that the peak power of any qpo can not exceed 2% of the continuum power measured at the centroid of the qpo at the 99% confidence level .",
    "in recent years , several groups have reported temporal analyses of mhd disk simulations . here , we briefly compare our work with some of these published results .",
    "probably the most relevant previous work is that of arras , blaes & turner ( 2006 ; hereafter abt ) .",
    "these authors perform a local , shearing box mhd simulation of a patch of an accretion disk ; this provides a controlled environment in which fluid modes can be characterized .",
    "abt find that the mhd turbulence excites a spectrum of distinct acoustic modes as well as radial epicyclic motions .",
    "however , they note a lack of distinct inertial modes ( g - modes ) and use this fact to argue against the excitation of trapped g - modes in global accretion disks .",
    "our findings are completely in line with those of abt , and represent an extension of abt s conclusions to global simulations of thin accretion disks .",
    "there have been qpos reported from global simulations .",
    "kato ( 2004d ) performed a global mhd disk simulation in a pw potential and presented an analysis of quantities derived from the mass accretion rate . through visual inspection of the resulting psds from four periods of the ( long ) simulation , he reports a pair of transient qpos and a pair of qpos that are labeled as persistent ( although it is not clear that they are present in the psd of all data segments , and the statistical significance of the features is unclear ) .",
    "the qpos are attributed to resonances between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies , and it is found that these qpo pairs have frequency ratios that are _ approximately _ 3:2 .",
    "we find no evidence of these resonances in our simulations . in another interesting difference , an inspection of the radially - resolved psds in kato ( 2004d )",
    "reveal no signs of the local p - modes that seem to feature so prominently in our psds .",
    "while the reason for these discrepancies is unclear , we do note that the kato ( 2004d ) simulations have an order of magnitude less resolution in both the azimuthal and ( more importantly ) the vertical direction , although his simulations do have a significantly larger computational domain .",
    "it is possible that the kato ( 2004d ) simulations have failed to adequately resolve the vertical dynamics of the thin disk .",
    "chan et al . ( 2006 ) have also performed global mhd disk simulations in a pw potential using the pseudo - spectral algorithm of chan , psaltis , & zel ( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "their study included a post - processing of the simulation to include detailed radiative transfer , and was explicitly targeted at understanding the variability ( including the large amplitude flaring ) of the hot accretion flow around the black hole at the center of the galaxy .",
    "they found that the turbulence of the quiescent flow could only produce a factor of two modulations in the observed luminosity . to model the large amplitude flares , they introduce large density perturbations into the flow . after being perturbed",
    ", the disk displays a qpo with a frequency equal to the orbital frequency at the magnetosonic point .",
    "given that the chan et al .",
    "study is exploring a rather different regime of accretion than our present study ( i.e. , hot , thick accretion flows versus thin , cold accretion flows ) , it is hard to make a direct comparison .",
    "finally , skh have performed detailed analyses of general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) simulations of disks performed using the code of de  villiers & hawley ( 2003 ) . in particular , they have studied a long ( @xmath57 ) simulation of a disk around a schwarzschild black hole , focusing on the temporal behavior of proxy - lightcurves ( rather than the underlying fluid properties discussed in this paper ) .",
    "it is unclear from their analysis whether their simulated accretion disk has excited local p - modes of the type that we find in this current work .",
    "skh do find , though , that a proxy - lightcurve based on radiative transfer through the disk assuming black body emission and free - free absorption displays qpos with an approximate 3:2 ratio .",
    "however , these qpos are transient , only appearing at certain times and certain viewing inclinations .",
    "as described above , several authors have reported transient qpo pairs from mhd simulations with frequency ratio 3:2 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret these as resonance phenomena . here",
    ", we note that there are several ways that approximate 3:2 ratios can be generated that do not necessarily involve resonances and , hence , one should guard against over - interpreting qpo pairs .",
    "indeed , we must remember that some sources have qpo frequency ratios that are inconsistent with 3:2 ( e.g. , the 67  hz and 41  hz qpos from grs  1915 + 105 ; see strohmayer 2001 ) .",
    "for example , consider the local vertical p - modes of the disk ( discussed in ",
    "[ sec : local_osc ] ) . at a given radius ,",
    "the @xmath58 vertical pressure mode has a frequency of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the orbital frequency . for a gas pressure dominated disk in which @xmath51 , @xmath61 , and for a radiation pressure dominated disk in which @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "if some unspecified physical process enhances emission from a given ring of the disk , one can imagine a situation where qpos are generated at the orbital frequency and the @xmath58 vertical pressure mode , thereby giving frequency ratios compatible with the measured ratios in several sources .",
    "alternatively , the next lowest vertical mode that has a vertical velocity node in the midplane ( and thus maximum variation of pressure and density there ) has a frequency of @xmath64 . as a result , when @xmath51 we have @xmath65 , and when @xmath62 the ratio is 1.46 . once again",
    ", if nature picks out a specific radius and the emission is modulated by the @xmath58 and @xmath42 modes , we would see qpos with frequency ratios entirely consistent with the observations .    as another example , suppose that the disk emission is modulated at the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies , and that the emission is distributed in radius according to a standard page & thorne ( 1974 ) disk .",
    "the radial distribution of the emission then peaks close to the radius where the radial epicyclic frequency is a maximum ( and hence is slowly changing with radius ) .",
    "one might then expect to see a pair of qpos corresponding to these two epicyclic frequencies .",
    "the frequency ratio depends only weakly on the spin parameter , ranging from 1.46 at @xmath66 to 1.7 at @xmath67 .",
    "the origin of hfqpos remains elusive .",
    "our simulations of geometrically - thin accretion disks have shown that mri - driven mhd turbulence does not excite the trapped g - modes of nowak & wagoner ( 1992 ) , even when those modes definitively exist in the equivalent hydrodynamic disk .",
    "we have also shown that mhd turbulence does not excite the parametric resonance instability of abramowicz & kluniak ( 2001 ) . instead ,",
    "the only distinct modes found in our simulated mhd disks are local vertical p - modes and radial epicyclic oscillations .",
    "clearly , the failure of all simulations to date to produce stable qpo pairs of the type seen in gbhbs suggests that either the qpos are too weak to be detected in the simulations or the models are missing some important physical ingredients .",
    "it is an open question whether the global disk modes or the parametric instabilities discussed in this paper can be excited once one includes the full effects of gr close to rapidly spinning black holes and/or radiation physics .",
    "indeed , the fact that hfqpos are only seen in rather special spectral states ( the soft intermediate state ; e.g. , see belloni 2006 ) when the accretion rate is thought to be comparable to the eddington limit suggests that radiation physics , in particular , may well be important to the hfqpo mechanism .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the transition from the hard intermediate state into the soft intermediate state is associated with powerful relativistic ejection events .",
    "thus , another interesting possibility is that hfqpo production occurs in the black hole magnetosphere ( i.e. , the base of the jet ) and not the accretion disk at all .",
