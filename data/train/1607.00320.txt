    "the origin , strength and structure of intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmf ) remain a mystery up to the present day .",
    "possible mechanisms to explain cosmic magnetogenesis may be divided into two main categories : cosmological scenarios predict that magnetic fields were generated through processes taking place in the early universe , such as inflation @xcite , electroweak @xcite or qcd phase transitions @xcite , and leptogenesis @xcite , among others ; in astrophysical scenarios the fields would be created during the later stages of evolution of the universe , for example during structure formation  @xcite or even thereafter @xcite .",
    "measurements of igmf are rather difficult due to their low magnitude .",
    "common methods to estimate the strength of igmf are indirect and include the well - known faraday rotation measurements which yield upper limits of the order of a few ng  @xcite .",
    "lower bounds , @xmath4 , have been obtained by several authors using gamma - ray - induced electromagnetic cascades in the intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "these lower bounds are controversial because of the claims  @xcite that the development of the cascade is suppressed by plasma instabilities that arise from interactions with the intergalactic medium . on the other hand , recent direct observations of cascades  @xcite",
    "suggest that plasma instabilities are not operative and that the original bounds hold .",
    "we expect that future analyses will clarify the role , if any , of plasma instabilities in the development of the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "magnetic fields can carry helicity ( @xmath5 ) , which is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the magnetic vector potential and @xmath8 is the magnetic field . since magnetic helicity affects the dynamical evolution of magnetic fields ,",
    "an indirect way to measure magnetic helicity is to measure the magnetic field power spectrum and compare it with the evolution seen in magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "ther are also some proposals to _ directly _ measure magnetic helicity based on the propagation of cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been proposed that helicity can leave characteristic parity - odd imprints on the arrival directions of gamma rays that are the result of gamma - ray - induced electromagnetic cascades @xcite .",
    "in particular , long & vachaspati  @xcite have carried out a thorough analysis of the morphology of the arrival directions of gamma rays using a semi - analytical approach , but without including the stochasticity of the magnetic field or the cascade process .",
    "hence , a full monte carlo approach and three - dimensional simulations are needed in order to confirm or refute their findings and provide a solid basis for further analyses .",
    "the observation of helical primordial magnetic fields has profound implications for particle physics and the early universe .",
    "scenarios in which the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry is generated dynamically are found to also produce helical magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the handedness of the field is related to details of the matter - genesis scenario  @xcite .",
    "if the observed magnetic fields are coherent on very large scales , they may have been produced at the initial epoch , perhaps during an inflation @xcite .",

    "a gamma ray emitted by a blazar interacts with photons from the diffuse extragalactic background radiation fields producing an electron - positron pair .",
    "the electrons then upscatter photons of the cosmic microwave background to high energies in a process known as inverse compton scattering ( ics ) . the electrons continue to upscatter photons until their energy diminishes .",
    "the upscattered photons can produce yet more electron - positron pairs until the energy of the photon drops below the threshold for pair production .",
    "we should therefore observe the blazar source as well as gamma rays originating from the cascade process , unless magnetic fields bend the electron trajectories sufficiently away from the line of sight .    to perform three - dimensional simulations of the development of gamma - ray - induced electromagnetic cascades in the igm ,",

    "in this section we present the results .",
    "some preliminary considerations regarding the setup of simulations should first be made .",
    "we use the large sphere observer approach which is a computationally efficient method for studying cosmic and gamma rays from a single source  @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the fact that this source is located in the center of a sphere which has a radius equal to @xmath96 , the distance from the source to the observer .",
    "hence , if a particle crosses the sphere from the inside to the outside , it is flagged ` detected ' .",
    "this will henceforth be called a ` hit ' and it corresponds to the particle reaching the observer .",
    "the source can emit gamma rays either within a jet or isotropically .",
    "due to the choice of a large sphere as an observer , all events above a given energy threshold ( here we use @xmath97 ) are detected .",
    "moreover , we can easily select a subset of the events and consider an arbitrary emission pattern , such as a jet of arbitrary half - opening angle @xmath98 , or an emission around an arbitrary direction tilted with respect to the line of sight .",
    "simple geometrical considerations allow us to correct the arrival directions on the large sphere to mimic earth s field of view . in the sky maps presented in this work , for each hit ,",
    "the corresponding coordinate system of the observer is placed such that its origin is located at the position of the hit while the @xmath15 axis points towards the source , _ i.e. _ in the direction of the center of the sphere . in order to determine the directions of the @xmath82 and @xmath99 axes , we take a `` global '' reference frame at a fixed point of the sphere and parallel - transport it along a geodesic to the location of the hit .",
    "then the spherical angles of the event are measured in the local frame located at the hit point .    while the `` large sphere observer '' method is economical",
    "as no photons are wasted , one possible concern is that in a realistic set - up most photons would indeed be wasted and the actual halo morphology would be sensitive to the absent photons .",
    "however , our results in the test case of a uniform magnetic field correlate well with analytic simulations @xcite , giving us confidence in the method .",
    "the magnetic field ( except for the uniform case ) is sampled in a grid with @xmath100 cells , where each cell has a size of @xmath101 .            for a gamma ray emitted at tev energy @xmath102 and observed at an energy @xmath103 , originating from a source ( blazar in our case ) located at redshift @xmath104 and distance @xmath96 ,",
    "traversing a magnetic field of strength @xmath105 , the expected average angular arrival direction is  @xcite @xmath106 this formula is only a rough estimate where @xmath107 is a factor close to unity , @xmath108 , which varies slightly with the ebl model chosen .",
    "furthermore , this equation is only valid if the coherence length ( @xmath109 ) of the field is much larger than the propagation length of electrons before they upscatter photons via inverse compton .",
    "this is always true in our simulations because the propagation length is of the order of 30  kpc , whereas the minimum coherence length is 10  mpc .    in order to compare our results with eq .",
    "( [ thetaebd ] ) , we simulate the propagation of gamma rays with initial energies @xmath110 , distance @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , emitted in a collimated jet along the line of sight assuming stochastic magnetic fields with strength of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the maps containing the arrival directions are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytcomp ] .",

    "( [ thetaebd ] ) .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : analytcomp ] .",
    "the results show a good agreement with the expected deflections .",
    "differences are due to the nature of the analytic formula itself , which has been derived in  @xcite using various simplifying assumptions .",
    "furthermore , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the deflection angle is highly sensitive to the particular ebl model used . in particular , for the ebl model used here ( kneiske & dole  ) , we expect @xmath115 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath116 for typical ebl models found in the literature .",
    "we now consider a simple scenario with a uniform magnetic field . by definition ,",
    "a uniform magnetic field has a preferred direction , and therefore one has to distinguish among three general cases depending on the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the axis of the jet : parallel , perpendicular , and intermediate orientation .",
    "the jet direction is assumed to be along the line of sight .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] these different cases are shown for a magnetic field of strength @xmath117 , assuming that the gamma rays are emitted in a jet with a half - opening angle of @xmath118 and with energy @xmath119 .",
    "the results for the three cases with a specific focus on their energy dependence are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] .",
    "the results for the first case , in which the magnetic field is parallel to the jet axis , are rather intuitive and are shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] .",
    "one can see that there is only one possible arrival direction , face - on , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath120 , which means that only electrons created with momenta parallel to the magnetic field lines , and thus not influenced by the lorentz force , can reach the observer .",
    "any electron that deviates from the line of sight will have a trajectory that leaves the plane spanned by the line of sight and the velocity direction of the initial tev photon and will not reach the observer .",
    "the second case , shown in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] , has a magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight . here only photons arriving in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field are detected .",
    "this means that the parent - electrons of these photons describe circular motion in this same plane .",
    "if an electron has a velocity component _ parallel _ to the magnetic field , it is initially directed away from the line of sight , and there is no component of the lorentz force that can bend it back towards the observer .    in the case of an intermediate orientation of the magnetic field , illustrated through the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] for a tilt angle of @xmath121 ( left ) and @xmath122 ( right ) , we obtain results between the two extreme cases previously discussed , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the patterns are now smeared out since electrons from a range of directions can be directed towards the observer .",
    "still , the dilution of the signal is small compared to the actual deflection , and hence this can be observed .",
    "therefore , relevant information can still be extracted from sky maps by using the morphology of the arrival directions .",
    "now we introduce magnetic helicity to the simulations .",
    "the source is assumed to have a half opening angle @xmath123 .",
    "we take the field to be stochastic with a batchelor spectrum as in eq .  ( [ eb120 ] ) . as we are assuming the maximal helical case , _",
    "@xmath124 , this also fixes the spectrum of @xmath125 according to eq .",
    "( [ hbeb ] ) .",
    "the field has an average field strength of @xmath126 and a correlation length of @xmath127 . here",

    "we have simulated the propagation of gamma rays with initial energy @xmath119 in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields with maximally negative ( @xmath133 ) , zero ( @xmath134 ) and maximally positive ( @xmath135 ) helicities gamma ray distribution by a parity reversal of the @xmath136 plot .",
    "however , we simulate the two cases independently to show two different stochastic realizations . ] . to simulate @xmath137 photons in our standard scenario described above , _ i.e. _ with @xmath111 and @xmath114 , the current version of the code takes @xmath138 hours on @xmath139 cores at @xmath140 .         the actual values for helicities for the whole simulation box as well as along the line sight",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : helgrid ] in order to illustrate to which extent statistics play a role .",
    "as one can see , both for the whole grid as well as just along the line of sight , which is more important to judge about the statistical significance for a given case , the helicity distribution corresponds to the sign it has been assigned .",
    "furthermore , from the panel on the right , one can see that for these particular realizations , for @xmath141 the absolute magnitude of @xmath142 is high close to the source and low close to the observer , while for @xmath143 it stays roughly equal along the propagation path .",
    "we can understand the qualitatively similar patterns for @xmath144 , _",
    "i.e. _ both patterns are spirals with similar twist , by noting that pair production on average happens close to the source , and both cases have similar helicity measures in that region . as a confirmation of this interpretation we found that in simulations in which the absolute value of @xmath142 is small close to the source , the spiral - like structures tend to be less distinct .",
    "the sky map containing the arrival directions of gamma rays are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : test5 g ] .",
    "we consider both the case for which the jet is directed along the line of sight ( left column ) and for which it is tilted by @xmath118 ( right column ) . for the former one can see the impact of magnetic helicity by comparing the top ( @xmath133 ) and bottom ( @xmath135 ) panels .",
    "a remarkable spiral - like pattern is clearly visible , being left- or right - handed depending on whether the helicity is negative or positive , respectively . for zero helicity ( @xmath134 , middle panels ) ,",
    "on the other hand , no clear orientation can be seen .",
    "we show here the results for @xmath145 .",
    "for lower coherence lengths ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath147 we find that the arrival direction pattern is washed out , and it is not possible to infer the presence of helicity , thus confirming the analytical predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite for this combination of parameters using simulations .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : difflc ] where the results for different @xmath109 and @xmath148 are shown .",
    "while for @xmath149 a clear characteristic spiral in the arrival directions can be seen , it becomes less visible for @xmath150 and disappears for @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 is a reasonable choice in order to show the effects of helicity discussed below .",
    "it is also a valid value in certain magnetogenesis scenarios  @xcite .    to understand the dependence of the spiral pattern on the coherence scale , we note that , for small coherence lengths , the spirals become too tight to be resolved , _",
    "i.e. _  their angular size becomes too small compared to the overall halo @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that the quality of the spiral might be highly sensitive to the specific values of the parameters of the setting such as @xmath105 , @xmath96 and @xmath109 which we will further investigate in the future .    on the other hand , for larger coherence lengths",
    "the spirals tend to a straight line , similarly to the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : homfield ] , approaching the case of a simple uniform magnetic field .",
    "this , again , is rather intuitive , since if @xmath152 , the stochastic magnetic field will effectively be uniform on the length scales in question .    on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : test5 g ] we show the same scenario described above , but this time the direction of the jet is tilted by @xmath118 with respect to the line of sight . as one can see in the figure , this reduces the effective area of arrival directions and also the symmetry of the pattern . in our example , for instance , one of the `` arms '' of the spiral pattern or a part of it is removed .",
    "this enables us to apply the @xmath0-statistics  @xcite ( discussed below ) to relate the helicity of the field with the arrival directions of gamma rays .",
    "it should be noted that all findings of this and the previous sections are in good agreement with the analytic predictions of ref .",

    "@xcite , the calculation of the parity - odd statistics , or @xmath0-statistics , should enable us , depending on the sign and general shape of the @xmath0-factors for different values of @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath166 , to draw conclusions about the helicity of the intervening helical magnetic field .",

    "the idea underlying idea of this new method that we denote @xmath1-statistics ( for `` spiral '' ) is that a gamma ray from a cascade that has a greater deflection away from the source direction due to the magnetic field will also have a greater azimuthal deflection if the magnetic field is helical .",

    "i.e. _  events with @xmath183 . for a right - handed spiral",
    "there should be higher values of @xmath181 for @xmath184 than for @xmath185 inside the band , while for a left - handed pattern @xmath181 should be smaller for @xmath184 than for @xmath185 .",
    "in other words , the peak of the function @xmath186 should be skewed to the right or to the left depending on whether the spiral is right- or left - handed , respectively . by finding a measure for this asymmetry or skew of the maximum",
    "one can deduce the orientation and subsequently the magnetic helicity .",
    "more concretely , the calculation is performed in the following way : first , we subdivide the interval on which @xmath179 is defined , _",
    "@xmath187 , in @xmath188 bins , such that each of the bins has a width @xmath189 .",
    "the @xmath159th bin , which corresponds to the interval @xmath190 , @xmath191 , will be labeled @xmath192 . for each bin",
    "we calculate @xmath193 by @xmath194 where @xmath195 are the coordinates of the @xmath196th event in the set @xmath197 and @xmath198 is the total number of events in this set . if @xmath197 is empty , we set @xmath199",
    ". furthermore , for real data it might be necessary to restrict the analysis to events with @xmath200 smaller than a certain value @xmath201 as for @xmath202 background photons might dominate and result in a false signal .    in this set of @xmath203 one",
    "now has to identify the relevant and significant maxima as well as the corresponding bin number @xmath204 and calculate the quantities @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the number of bins we need to consider in order to include the width of the peak .",
    "here one has to assume periodicity , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath207 .",
    "essentially @xmath208 corresponds to the average value of @xmath209 to the left of the peak and @xmath210 to the right of the peak .",
    "the final step is to define the @xmath1-statistics that measures the skewness of the peak @xmath211 for a right - handed spiral @xmath1 will be positive , whereas for a left - handed spiral it will be negative .",
    "we performed this computation for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : test5 g ] . the plots for @xmath181 , shown for different energies ,",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : thetabar ] . even without any further analysis one can see in this figure that the peaks for opposite orientations indeed show opposite skews  while on the left panel",
    "higher angles are achieved for @xmath212 , on the right panel , even more clearly , that is the case for @xmath185 . for the central panel , however ,",
    "peaks of either skewness are found .         in order to support these qualitative considerations ,",
    "one has to look at the @xmath1-values which have been calculated and are presented for the three cases in tabs .",
    "[ tab : stab-1][tab : stab+1 ] .",
    "the most clear case here is the one for @xmath143 , where for all energy ranges we obtain @xmath213 with two values even going as low as @xmath214 .",
    "this means that the morphology of the arrival directions is solely right - handed which is also clearly seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : test5 g ] . for the case of @xmath141",
    "the situation is less clear as there is only one value being as high as @xmath215 .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath1 is positive for all energy ranges with three exceptions for which , however the absolute value of @xmath1 is close to zero , this is strong evidence for a left - handed orientation .",
    "finally , no clear statement can be made regarding the case with no helicity ( @xmath216 )  here one does not find significant negative or positive values for @xmath1 .",
    "as the last step , we need to connect the handedness of the arrival direction pattern with the sign of helicity . their correlation has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an analysis has been carried out for a homogeneous magnetic field . in this reference",
    "the authors indeed find that for a positive helicity one expects a right - handed orientation , whereas for negative helicities a left - handed orientation should be observed , thus confirming our results for stochastic fields .    as a concluding remark",
    "it should be stated that for the results presented above we used simulations containing approximately @xmath217 photons arriving at earth in the energy range @xmath218 , which provided clear patterns with satisfactory statistical significance . the upcoming cherenkov telescope array ( cta )",
    "@xcite might be able to detect this kind of signature in the energy range @xmath219 with @xmath220 of observation .",
    "fewer photons would distort the picture since , for example in the case of the @xmath1-statistics , the peaks would become less visible , such that a reliable calculation would no longer be possible .",
    "this is the case for high energy photons as their contribution to the total flux is rather small . on the other hand , for",
    "the lowest energies ( @xmath221a few gev ) , even with as few as @xmath222 photons relevant peaks can be seen , which , however , might be more difficult to construe in a more realistic case considering additionally diffuse gamma ray radiation and multiple sources .",

    "we have performed three - dimensional monte carlo studies of the development of gamma - ray - induced electromagnetic cascades in the intergalactic medium in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "we have used the `` large sphere observer '' method for improved computational performance . in this case",
    "all cascade photons hitting the surface of the sphere are detected by the the observer . with a standard three - dimensional monte carlo simulation",
    "most cascade photons would not reach earth , resulting in wasted computation and very low statistics .",
    "a simplification made in our treatment is that the magnetic field evolves adiabatically with redshift as @xmath223 .",
    "this is justified because the cascade development we have discussed occurs in cosmic voids where mhd amplification and contamination by sources is minimal . also , the sources are at redshifts @xmath224 .",
    "we first compared our computational setup with analytical approximations and then validated it in simple scenarios containing a uniform magnetic field oriented parallelly and perpendicularly to the line of sight of the blazar jet .",
    "as expected , for a magnetic field parallel to the direction of the jet of half - opening angle @xmath98 , assumed to be pointing toward earth , effects of the field were not observed . for a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the jet , deflections were non - zero and in the expected direction .",

    "the results tend to converge toward the case of a uniform magnetic field in the limit of large coherence lengths .",
    "we have considered only large values of correlation length ( @xmath127 ) since for much smaller coherence lengths , with the other parameters being held fixed , no clear signature of helicity can be seen , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : difflc ] .",
    "nevertheless , one should bear in mind that the current upper limits of coherence length of magnetic fields in voids range between a few and hundreds of mpc  @xcite , placing the chosen value of 120 mpc well within the allowed bounds .",
    "we have deployed the so - called @xmath0-statistics , a powerful analysis tool that makes it possible to determine the properties of magnetic helicity directly from the observables of gamma rays measured at earth . in this",
    "work we for the first time applied @xmath0-statistics to realistic three - dimensional simulations of electromagnetic cascades .",
    "our results for @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qtest5 g ] .",
    "the plots do not show a strong correlation between @xmath0 and the existence and sign of the helicity . at the moment we can not clearly state whether averaging over several objects will show a stronger correlation .",
    "we plan on investigating this issue in a future work .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that @xmath0-statistics might not be the final method to quantify magnetic helicity , however it is a good initial approach and has been used in several works ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) with satisfactory results . in this work",
    "we have , for the first time , introduced the @xmath1-statistics , which is a direct measure of the handedness of a pattern with respect to the line of sight .",
    "we have shown that the orientation , represented by the sign of @xmath1 , is directly correlated with the sign of helicity .",
    "this shows that the @xmath1 measure is also a powerful tool to be used in the analysis of helicity of igmf .",
    "backgrounds at the @xmath22510 - 100 gev energy range are expected due to secondary photons from agn halos whose jet opening angles do not encompass the earth .",
    "other astrophysical sources of photons in this energy range also exist and have to be taken into account . in this first work we have neglected these backgrounds , which will be included in future studies .",
    "we found that it is probably necessary to analyze various sources in order to make a definite statement about the sign of the helicity , since a clear signature can not always be seen . in the future",
    "we will extend our simulations to the case of multiple sources and diffuse gamma rays .",
    "we expect to be able to reproduce actual detections and consequently retrieve more precise information about igmf , which can be used to infer their origin and evolution .",
    "in addition , we will extend the analysis by further exploring the parameter space as varying quantities such as the magnetic field strength @xmath226 , the magnetic correlation length @xmath109 and source parameters such as its distance from the observer , its energy spectrum or its cutoff energy , as they may be important in order to obtain a complete picture of their influence as discussed above and to explain actual observations .",
