    "quantum ( bose or fermi ) statistics is a very basic concept in physics , directly arising from the indiscernability principle of the microscopic world .",
    "however effective models employing different statistics have proved to be very useful to describe some selected aspects of complex interacting microscopic systems . as an example , an ideal fermi gas with fermi - dirac statistics can be described in certain approximations by a boltzmann distribution with repulsive interaction , while a bosonic ideal gas , by an attractive potential @xcite . on more general grounds ,",
    "the statistical mechanics of fractional exclusion statistics ( fes ) quasi - particle systems was formulated by several authors @xcite , based on the fes concept introduced by haldane in ref .",
    "this has been a prolific concept and was applied to both quantum and classical systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a stochastic method for the simulation of the time evolution of fes systems was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a generalization of a similar method used for bose and fermi systems @xcite , whereas the relatively recent experimental realization of the fermi degeneracy in cold atomic gases has renewed the interest in the theoretical investigation of non - ideal fermi systems at low temperatures and their interpretation as ideal fes systems @xcite .",
    "the general fes formalism was amended to include the change of the fes parameters at the change of the particle species @xcite .",
    "this amendment allows the general implementation of fes as a method for the description of interacting particle systems as ideal ( quasi)particle gases @xcite .",
    "however , the level of approximation of such a description and the connections with other many - particle methods are not yet clear .",
    "a rigorous connection between the fes and the bethe ansatz equations for an exactly solvable model was worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite in the one - dimensional case . in higher dimensions",
    ", one can expect that the statistics and interaction would not be transmutable in general because interaction and exchange positions between two particles can occur separately .",
    "however indications exist that a mapping might exist between ideal fes and interacting particles with regular quantum statistics in the quasi - particle semi - classical approximation given by the self - consistent mean - field theory . indeed , in refs .",
    "@xcite the fes was applied to describe bose gases with local ( @xmath0-function ) interaction in two - dimensional traps in the thomas fermi ( tf ) limit . in this paper",
    "we generalize this result to apply fes to bose and fermi systems of particles with generic two - body interactions in arbitrary external potentials in the landau or tf semiclassical limit in any number of dimensions .",
    "we define quasiparticle energies which determine our fes parameters and using these we calculate the fes equilibrium particle distribution .",
    "moreover , we calculate the particle distribution also starting from the mean - field description by defining the landau type of quasiparticles , and we show that the two descriptions are equivalent , i.e. the populations are identical , provided that we make the mapping between the fes and landau s quasiparticle energies .",
    "this equivalence proves that our fes description of the interacting particle system corresponds to a self - consistent mean - field approximation .",
    "such an approximation , though certainly not adequate to fully describe strongly interacting quantum systems , is the basis of a number of highly predictive theoretical methods in many - body physics , from landau fermi liquid theory to density functional methods in correlated electron or nucleon systems .",
