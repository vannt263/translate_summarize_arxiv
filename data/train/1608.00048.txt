    "a theoretical study by thorne et al . ( 1984 ) based on laboratory experiments predicted that phosphorus monoxyde po should be the most abundant p - bearing molecule in molecular clouds , hence the main reservoir of phosphorus in the gas phase .",

    "po was found as abundant as pn in the envelope of vy cma , a fact which led the authors to propose that these species are formed from shocks in the circumstellar envelope ; they also concluded that po and pn are the main reservoir of phosphorus in the gas phase .",

    ", a careful determination of the abundance of p - bearing species in the gas phase shows that they contain _ only _ a few percent of the total elemental phosphorus .",
    "in section 3 , we showed that the emission from pn and po arises from the l1157-b1 outflow cavity , which can be described by a c - type shock ( lefloch et al .",
    "2012 ; holdship et al .",
    "we therefore investigate the origin of the po and pn emission in this region by the use of the chemical gas - grain model ucl_chem ( viti et al .",

    "we use the same approach as viti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) where we modelled the ammonia and water emission across the same region .",
    "we note that a similar approach was used by aota & aikawa ( 2012 ) to reproduce the previous observations of pn and po performed by yamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) toward the same outflow cavity .",
    "we stress that our new observational constraints lead to different conclusions about the history of the region and the shock parameters .",
    "this point is more specifically addressed in sect .",
    "we study the evolution of phosphorous - bearing species in a one dimensional c - shock , but with the specific aim of determining whether po and pn are mainly formed and destroyed in the gas phase prior to the shock passage , on the grains , or during the shock event(s ) .",
    "moreover , as in viti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , our model is able to determine whether the differences in line profiles discussed above may be explained by the differences in abundances at different velocities .",
    "a detailed description of ucl_chem coupled with the shock model can be found in viti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main characteristics of the code .",
    "the code is run in two phases , where phase i forms a dense core out of a diffuse medium , starting from an essentially atomic gas .",
    "we adopt an initial density of 100 @xmath96 for the diffuse medium . during this phase , gas - phase chemistry ,",
    "freezing on to dust particles and subsequent surface processing occur .",
    "the sticking efficiency for all species is assumed to be 100% but the rate of depletion is a function of density ( in a similar manner as in rawlings et al .",
    "the density at the end of phase i is a free parameter , called from now on the pre - shock density .",
    "the second phase computes the time - dependent chemical evolution of the gas and dust during the passage of a shock .",
    "the model includes both thermal desorption , due to the dust being heated by the presence of the outflow , as well as sputtering of the icy mantles once the dynamical age across the c - shock has reached the `` saturation timescales '' , as in jimenez - serra et al .",
    "the saturation timescale corresponds to the time when most of the ices have been injected into the gas phase , due to the passage of the shock ( jimenez - serra et al .",
    "such timescales are inversely proportional to the density of the gas and for pre - shock  densities of @xmath97@xmath98 , these times range between 10 and 100 years , i.e. factors 10 - 100 shorter than the typical dynamical ages of young molecular outflows ( @xmath99 ) . our chemical gas - phase network is taken from umist 12and is augmented with updates from the kida database .",
    "the surface network comprises mainly hydrogenation reactions .",
    "in particular we note that neither umist 12 nor kida contains a network for ph@xmath7 . rather than creating an _ ad hoc _ set of reactions for this species we made the assumptions that this species will be preferentially formed on the grains by hydrogenation and that therefore ph@xmath64 could act as a proxy for ph@xmath7 .",
    "of course this also means that we are assuming that the routes for gas phase destruction for ph@xmath7 and ph@xmath64 are similar . in all our figures we therefore present ph@xmath64 as a proxy for ph@xmath7 .",
    "we ran a small grid of models where we varied :    * the pre - shock density ; we have adopted two possible values for the total hydrogen nuclei density n(h+@xmath100 h@xmath64)based on previous studies of this cavity : 10@xmath101 and 10@xmath102 . * the shock velocity , from 20 to @xmath5 . from the pre - shock density and the shock velocity the maximum temperature of the neutral fluid attained within the shock",

    "* the initial elemental abundance of phosphorous : while its abundance in the diffuse , warm ism , is found to be solar ( e.g. jenkins , savage & spitzer 1986 ) , all the studies so far of phosphorous - bearing species in star forming regions have found that the initial elemental abundance of phosphorous needs to be depleted by up to a factor of 100 in order to match the observations ( aota & aikawa 2012 ; fontani et al .",
    "2016 ; rivilla et al .",
    "we have therefore varied this parameter and adopted values of solar ( 2.57@xmath10310@xmath104 ) down to a depletion factor of 100 . * the duration of the pre - shock phase ( phase i ) .",
    "we have considered a short - lived and a long - lived scenario , respectively , to investigate the impact of different initial gas compositions , as a result of different cloud ages . in the first case ,",
    "the core is immediately subjected to the passage of a shock when it reaches the pre - shock density ; in the second case , the core is allowed to remain static for about 2 million years .",
    "the observations yield abundance values for po and pn of the order of 13@xmath77 , for a common source size of @xmath105 , with po larger by a factor of 3 or so than pn .",
    "ph@xmath7 is undetected , and has an upper limit of 10@xmath106 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "3 the evolution of phosphorous bearing species as well as nitrogen as a function of time during the passage of the shock ( phase ii ) , when the initial elemental abundance of phosphorus is depleted by a factor of 100 and the pre - shock phase is long - lived .",
    "we show the result for three shock velocities ( 20,30 , @xmath5 ) , pre - shock densities of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and long-/short - lived pre - shock phase in figs .  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the depletion effect affects only the overall abundance of p - bearing species .",
    "our first result is that none of the models where phosphorous is solar can fit the observations , as all phosphorous bearing species are about two orders of magnitude higher than what is observed .",
    "models where the total gas - phase phosphorous is @xmath107 are therefore favoured .    as can be seen in fig .  3",
    ", we find that ph@xmath64 is immediately released in the gas phase , as a result of the grain mantle sputtering at the passage of shock .",
    "pn follows closely the evolution of ph@xmath64 , while po forms gradually and its abundance rises slowly in the shock .",
    "this is in agreement with our observations , where there is a clear shift toward more blue - shifted velocities for po than for pn , which is consistent with a delay in the formation of po in the gas phase with respect to pn .    if the pre - shock phase ( phase i ) is short - lived ( fig .",
    "4 ) we never reach a situation where po is clearly larger than pn throughout the shock evolution . as explained below",
    ", this is due to the lack of significant depletion of atomic n for time - scales < 1 myr .",
    "atomic phosphorus also remains abundant in the gas phase , at abundances of about @xmath95 , comparable to or larger than that of pn , depending on the pre - shock density .",
    "if the pre - shock phase ( phase i ) is short - lived we never reach a situation where po is clearly larger than pn throughout the shock evolution .",
    "this is the reason why aota & aikawa ( 2012 ) opted for a short - lived pre - shock phase to explain the upper limits of po measured toward l1157-b1 by yamaguchi et al .",
    "given the uncertainties in the derivation of po and pn abundances , we can not discard a situation the po / pn ratio is simply @xmath108 , however .",
    "a chemical analysis on the formation and destruction of po and pn shows that the key player in their chemistry is atomic nitrogen ( as also found by aota & aikawa 2012 ) , which in turn is mainly released from ammonia nh@xmath7 in the shock : for example , for the higher pre - shock densities ( @xmath98 ) and weak shocks ( @xmath46 ) , a significant fraction of atomic nitrogen is still present in the gas phase and hence po is destroyed by the reaction @xmath109 .",
    "this reaction contributes to @xmath11085% to the total destruction of po . when the shock velocity is higher , about @xmath111 , the temperature of the neutral fluid is also higher and favours the conversion of n into nh@xmath7 , and therefore po survives in the gas phase for longer .",
    "however , at higher velocities ( @xmath5 ) , as also shown in viti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , nh@xmath7 is efficiently destroyed in the post - shock gas , liberating n into the gas phase and augmenting the destruction of po via n ( a route that here contributes to 100% of the po destruction ) .",
    "this leads to a faster drop for po .",
    "this process requires that the maximum temperature in the shock is larger than @xmath4 .    because the amount of available nitrogen is key to the survival of po , a higher pre - shock density favours it :",
    "for higher densities , more nitrogen is locked onto grains in the form of nh@xmath7 .",
    "the atomic nitrogen abundance decreases by @xmath112 when the pre - shock density increases from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ( see e.g. figs .",
    "since from previous discussion in sect .",
    "3.2 , the terminal velocity of po is smaller ( about @xmath113 ) than the pn one ( almost @xmath114 ) , the model with a shock velocity of @xmath5 ( bottom right of fig .",
    "3 ) is the best match , as po is destroyed at the end of the post - shock region as a consequence of the destruction of nh@xmath7 .",
    "the best matching models are in fact those where the pre - shock phase is longer - lived ( fig .",
    "3 ) , again , because atomic nitrogen has more time to get locked in the icy mantles before the arrival of the shock . in all the models from fig .  3 ,",
    "pn and po are comparable for most of the dissipation length .",
    "the only model for which we find a sharp decrease in abundance in the postshock region is the model with pre - shock density of @xmath98 and a shock velocity of @xmath5 .",
    "such a drop occurs at a time of @xmath115 and translates into lower terminal velocities of the po line emission .",
    "models with a shock velocity of @xmath46 and @xmath116 also indicate a po abundance drop from the gas phase .",
    "this abundance drop occurs at a longer time however , once passed the dissipation length , which makes it difficult to quantify accurately based on our simple modelling .",
    "because of this , and because similar shock velocities are also required to explain the different line profiles observed toward l1157-b1 for nh@xmath7 and h@xmath64o ( viti et al .",
    "2011 ) , we favour the scenario in which pn and po are formed in a shock with a velocity of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that a high pre - shock density also favours the idea that dense clumps along outflows pre - exist the outflow event itself and are not in fact formed by compression due to the arrival of the shock ( viti et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "using the detection of the pn @xmath8=21 line and the non - detection of po by yamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in l1157-b1 , aota & aikawa ( 2012 ) modelled the phosphorous chemistry in the shocked region of l1157-b1 by using a chemical model coupled with the parametric shock model by jimenez - serra et al .",
    "these authors searched for shock solutions whereby pn was abundant while po was not .",
    "the wider and richer spectral content of the asai data brings more robust constraints on the properties of p - bearing species po , pn ( and ph@xmath7 ) in l1157-b1 , affecting some of their conclusions on the shock properties : their study favours a shock velocity of @xmath46 , while our results suggest that pn and po are formed in a @xmath5 shock . in our model a maximum temperature of 4000 k is indeed required in the shock to liberate atomic",
    "n into the gas phase from nh3 and to destroy po at higher velocities in the shock ( as suggested by the observed different terminal velocities of pn and po ; section 3.2 ) .",
    "our conclusions on the depletion of elemental phosphorus by a factor of 100 in molecular dark clouds , and of the importance of atomic n in the chemistry of po and pn , agree with those of aota & aikawa ( 2012 ) .",
    "recent studies of pn and po towards the high - mass star forming regions w51 e1/e2 and w3(oh ) by fontani et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and rivilla et al .",
    "( 2016 ) reach conclusions similar to ours : phosphorus appears to be depleted in quiescent molecular gas by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the abundances they derive towards these massive sources are of the order @xmath117 , typically one order of magnitude less than towards the shock l1157-b1 .",
    "interestingly , they report similar po / pn abundance ratios ( @xmath85 23 ) . observations with the noema array",
    "would permit more accurate determination of the depletion factor by resolving the size of the emitting region of po and pn at a few arcsec scale .",
    "mapping the relative spatial distribution of po and pn as a function of velocity would permit confirmation of our conclusions on the shock parameters .",
    "we report on a systematic search for p - bearing species towards the solar - type star forming region l1157 . we have unambiguously detected emission from pn and , for the first time , from the pre - biotic molecule po in the outflow shock region l1157-b1 . no emission from p - bearing species",
    "was detected towards the envelope of the protostar l1157-mm .",
    "spectral line profile analysis suggests that the emission originates from the same region as sio , with a typical size of 15@xmath118 .",
    "the abundances of po and pn are found comparable , with values of 2.5 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "a simple modelling using the c - shock code of jimenez - serra et al . ( 2006 ) coupled the chemical gas - grain model ucl_chem ( viti et al .",
    "2004 ) allows us to reproduce the main features of po and pn emission in the shock .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows : + - phosphorus is depleted by about a factor 100 in the gas phase .",
    "+ - atomic nitrogen plays a key role in the formation and destruction routes of po and pn + - the observed po / pn abundance ratio is @xmath119 , and brings constraints on the duration of the pre - shock phase , which has to be larger than @xmath120 and the pre - shock density , of the order of @xmath98 .",
    "+ - the maximum temperature in the shock has to be @xmath121 in order to account for the difference of terminal velocities between po and pn .",
    "+ follow - up observations at arcsec scale with the noema array would permit probing the model we propose for the formation of po and pn in the shock . by resolving the size of the emitting region of po and pn , it would possible to confirm that both species form in different regions of the shock , and to estimate more accurately the phosphorus depletion factor in the gas phase .",
