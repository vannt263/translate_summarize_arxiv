    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] , respectively , toward the dilute limit @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we combine the above results to establish the universal phase diagram of a three - component fermi gas . because we developed controlled understanding on quantum phases in all available limits of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one emergent phase boundary has to end up as another phase boundary of the same type .",
    "accordingly , the quantum critical lines for the superfluid transition found in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : superfluid_bcs ] ) and ( [ eq : superfluid_bec ] ) are connected , and those for the lifshitz transition found in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lifshitz_narrow ] ) and ( [ eq : lifshitz_bec ] ) are also connected .",
    "this leads to the minimal but rich phase structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "an interesting observation is that the unpaired fermi surface coexisting with the superfluid is that of atoms in the weak coupling @xmath12 or dense region @xmath72 , while it is that of trimers in the strong coupling and dilute region , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . because there is no sharp distinction between them in terms of symmetries or topologies ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of atoms and trimers in the superfluid phase can be smoothly connected .",
    "if we associate three components of fermions with three colors of quarks  @xcite , this observation corresponds to a smooth crossover from deconfined quarks to confined baryons with decreasing density , which is known as the quark - hadron continuity  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the analogous new feature in a three - component fermi gas shall be termed an `` atom - trimer continuity . ''",
    "regarding low - lying excitations in the superfluid phase , the breaking of the @xmath18 symmetry down to @xmath73 generates three nambu - goldstone bosons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of an unpaired fermi surface , there exists a gapless fermionic excitation which has the character of an atom on one side and that of a trimer on the other side . because only the parity of a particle number is conserved in the superfluid phase , an unpaired atom and a trimer can not be distinguished by their particle numbers .",
    "accordingly , the gapless fermionic excitation can also exhibit a crossover with its effective mass changing smoothly from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , which signals the atom - trimer continuity  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the controlled analyses , we also develop a model analysis to quantify the phase diagram . a guiding principle to construct the model",
    "is that it must incorporate the correct asymptotic behaviors discussed above .",
    "the simplest possibility is just to add a contribution of noninteracting trimers to the mean - field grand potential density ( [ eq : mean_field ] ) : @xmath76^{5/2}}{90\\pi^2m}\\theta(3\\mu - e_3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by solving the gap equation @xmath77 and the number density equation @xmath78 at @xmath79 , we find that the superfluid transition takes place at @xmath80 the obtained quantum critical line is plotted in fig .",

    "( [ eq : superfluid_bcs ] ) and ( [ eq : superfluid_bec ] ) ] in the weak and strong coupling limits @xmath81 .",

    "the shaded region indicates where the smooth crossover from the fermi surface of atoms ( left side ) to trimers ( right side ) takes place .",
    "[ fig : mean_field ] ]    on the other hand , in the range of fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_field ] , the lifshitz transition takes place at @xmath86 where the fermi surface of trimers disappears with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained quantum critical line is plotted by the dashed curve , which again yields the correct asymptotic behavior [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : lifshitz_bec ] ) ] in the strong coupling limit @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , the fermi surface of trimers appears at @xmath88 and that of atoms disappears at @xmath42 , which correspond to the left and right edges of the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_field ] , respectively .",
    "while they define sharp boundaries in our simple treatment of trimers as noninteracting particles , such sharp boundaries need not actually exist .",
    "indeed , a more elaborate model with interaction terms @xmath89 added to the mean - field plus trimer model can incorporate the atom - trimer continuity by hybridizing an unpaired atom and a trimer ( represented by @xmath90 ) by a condensed dimer  @xcite .",
    "the shaded region is thus meant to indicate where the smooth crossover from the fermi surface of atoms to trimers takes place with increasing @xmath0 .     for @xmath91 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath92 ( dotted curve ) , and @xmath93 ( solid curve ) .",
    "these values of @xmath1 are above , at , and below the critical resonance range for opening the complete depletion of the superfluid by the trimer fermi gas , which gives rise to a pair of quantum critical points .",
    "[ fig : tc ] ]    we also extend the mean - field plus trimer model ( [ eq : model ] ) to nonzero temperature with a caveat that the mean - field approximation overestimates the critical temperature in the strong coupling region @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : tc ] shows the obtained superfluid critical temperature as a function of @xmath0 for three different values of @xmath1 . with decreasing @xmath1 from above ,",
    "the superfluid is gradually suppressed by the emergence of trimers .",
    "eventually , below the critical value @xmath84 , there appears a finite window in @xmath0 where the superfluid is completely depleted by the trimer fermi gas , which gives rise to a pair of quantum critical points .",
    "these are the same type of quantum critical point as that studied in the context of bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite .",
    "also , the same role of the trimer in the dilute limit was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on approximate three - body calculations .",
    "a narrow feshbach resonance sets the stage to investigate universal aspects of a three - component fermi gas .",
    "we explored its universal phase diagram with equal masses , densities , and interactions and found the minimal but rich phase structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "our main discovery is a new type of crossover physics : in addition to the ordinary bcs - bec crossover from loosely bound cooper pairs to tightly bound dimers , unpaired fermions coexisting with the superfluid can change smoothly from atoms to trimers , corresponding to the quark - hadron continuity in a dense nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "this new feature , termed an atom - trimer continuity , provides a novel analogy between ultracold atoms and quantum chromodynamics and should be investigated further .    at zero temperature",
    ", even identical fermions can form cooper pairs in some partial wave channel  @xcite .",
    "an interaction between unpaired atoms in the weak coupling region @xmath12 is induced by a density fluctuation of the other components of fermions , while an interaction between unpaired trimers in the strong coupling region @xmath13 is induced by a density fluctuation of the superfluid dimers which dominates over a direct trimer - trimer interaction . because both induced interactions cause an instability in the @xmath95-wave channel  @xcite",
    ", the previously unpaired fermi surface exhibits the @xmath95-wave superfluidity regardless of whether it was of atoms or trimers .",
    "therefore , the atom - trimer continuity remains intact . here",
    "the @xmath95-wave pairing of atoms or trimers breaks the @xmath73 symmetry of the @xmath3-wave superfluid phase down to @xmath96 besides broken rotational symmetries . on the other hand , because the @xmath3-wave superfluid phase with no unpaired fermi surface retains the @xmath73 symmetry , the previous lifshitz transition ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) becomes the @xmath95-wave superfluid transition .",
    "the trimer fermi gas phase is still distinct from the other two phases because its symmetry breaking pattern is different , @xmath97 by any pairing of trimers .",
    "thus far we focused on the maximally symmetric case , while our approach can be easily generalized to unequal masses , densities , and interactions .",
    "furthermore , the ideas developed here can be used to investigate universal aspects of other systems , such as a two - component fermi gas with a large mass ratio @xmath98  @xcite , which also lacks a universal ground state in the vicinity of a broad feshbach resonance .",

    "<S> , there exists a lifshitz transition between superfluids with and without an unpaired fermi surface as a function of @xmath0 . with decreasing @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface coexisting with the superfluid can change smoothly from that of atoms to trimers ( `` atom - trimer continuity '' ) , corresponding to the quark - hadron continuity in a dense nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , there appears a finite window in @xmath0 where the superfluid is completely depleted by the trimer fermi gas , which gives rise to a pair of quantum critical points . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of these three quantum phases are determined in regions where controlled analyses are possible and are also evaluated based on a mean - field plus trimer model . </S>"
