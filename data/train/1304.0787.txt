    "for a closed thermodynamic system in equilibrium , the volumetric compressibility @xmath0 is strictly non - negative because of stability constraints .",
    "such constraints are manifest through first - order phase transitions and phase separation via the maxwell construction that effectively avoids any branch in the @xmath1 diagram that would correspond to negative @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , during any equilibrium phase transition , the occupied volume always decreases as pressure increases and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this analysis implicitly assumes that stress changes infinitely slowly .",
    "however , when the stress changes at a finite rate , it is common for a solid @xcite ( and also for polymers @xcite ) to occupy a metastable configuration for an extended period before undergoing a phase change , and hence the previous stability constraints no longer apply .",
    "we posit that , if an increase in tension causes the previous equilibrium state to become metastable , the solid may undergo a transition in which the decay of this super - strained state results in a decrease in volume as the tension increases .",

    "[ fig2](b ) : when the linking string is cut , the initially slack support strings become taut and the mass can , counterintuitively , rise .",

    "figure [ fig6 ] illustrates the vibrational modes of such a constituent in which the central particles move in opposite directions .",
    "these modes are of particular interest because they are precisely the vibrations that give rise to the coupling and decoupling transitions of the constituents , and thus the frequencies of these modes indicate how often such events may occur .",

    "however , decouplings become possible when the stress increases past some @xmath73 , where the decoupled equilibrium appears , and necessarily occur by some @xmath74 , where the coupled equilibrium ceases to exist . then , applying our estimate for the transition rate for each constituent , the expected number of decoupling transitions that will occur by the time the stress reaches some @xmath11 is given by the integral of the rate over time @xmath75 where @xmath76 . in the second equality , we have changed the integration variable from time to stress and used the fact that @xmath77 . equation ( [ decouple ] ) should be interpreted as a valid estimate of the first transition event , which is all we need to complete our model for the decay of metastable states .",
    "specifically , we note that the transition events are largely irreversible ( they tend to go only from metastable to stable states ) and different transition events are not independent in the material : a single coupling or decoupling transition produces a cascade of further transitions , and macroscopic metastability can be completely and suddenly lost .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] compares the predictions of the model [ eq .  ( [ model ] ) and corresponding equation for @xmath83 ] with md simulations for both stress- and strain - controlled processes .",
    "the model quite accurately predicts the general trends of the metastable decay over the wide range of temperatures and stressing / straining rates that we simulated . in all cases ,",
    "smaller stressing / straining rate @xmath103 and larger temperature @xmath12 tend to lead to earlier decoupling transitions .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently low temperatures ( dotted and dashed lines ) , these transitions are icts [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] and force amplification transitions [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "remarkably , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig5 ] , our model predicts icts even for very large , macroscopic sizes ( @xmath104 ) over very small , macroscopic stressing rates ( @xmath105 ) for moderate temperatures ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "in fact , this persistence of icts can be deduced by inspection from eqs .",
    "( [ decouple ] ) and ( [ model ] ) .",
    "icts will occur provided metastable states persist until the stress becomes sufficiently large , while larger temperature @xmath12 , smaller stressing rate @xmath106 , and larger system size @xmath52 all tend to promote earlier metastable decay .",
    "but the temperature dependence in eq .",
    "( [ decouple ] ) is exponential , while the dependence on @xmath106 and @xmath52 are only polynomial .",
    "therefore , on inverting eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , it follows that @xmath79 depends only logarithmically on @xmath106 [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] and @xmath52 [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] , so that small temperatures can easily offset their effects [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ] .",
    "this provides evidence that icts are possible for a wide range of conditions .",
    "it is instructive to compare phase transitions exhibiting inverted compressibility with ordinary phase transitions , which do not . in ordinary first - order phase transitions ,",
    "the curve of spinodal points in the phase diagram lies strictly within the region of phase coexistence .",
    "the emergence of an ict implies a violation of this condition , as follows . for metastable coupled states reached while increasing @xmath11 ,",
    "the stress is larger than the stress of any state in the phase coexistence region ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , by convexity , the thermodynamic equilibrium to which these metastable coupled states decay must have a strain larger than the strain of any state within the phase coexistence region . therefore ,",
    "if these decays correspond to a decrease in the strain ( as observed in icts ) , the spinodal point at which the metastable coupled states cease to exist must occur at a yet larger strain , and hence the curve of spinodal points can not be confined to the region of phase coexistence .",
    "although their potential for icts has not been previously recognized , the global behavior of spinodal curves has been of wide interest in other contexts for many years ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "while icts have not been experimentally observed , we propose that with the significant advances made in designing both electromagnetic @xcite and acoustic @xcite metamaterials , it is possible to realize engineered materials that undergo icts .",
    "now , one may wonder why icts have not been previously predicted .",
    "this possibility was likely not anticipated because most previous continuum @xcite and lattice @xcite models of solid - solid phase transitions have postulated a free energy that is a function of a single dilation or shear strain field .",
    "such models necessarily result in stress - strain relations in which the stress is a single - valued function of the strain , as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "however , in systems like ours , additional fields are required to model not only the total length @xmath7 of the constituents ( corresponding to the usual strain field ) , but also the internal @xmath5 and @xmath6 degrees of freedom .",
    "the many - to - many nature of the relationship in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is the result of `` projecting away '' these internal strains .",
    "more generally , this observation indicates that any effective field theory that can account for icts will necessarily require additional fields ( e.g. , internal strains ) beyond the external strain .    ultimately , it is the global shape of the hysteresis curve that leads to the inverted response , and thus analogous phenomena associated with thermodynamically conjugated variables other than stress and strain can also emerge .",
    "that is , given a thermodynamic state variable @xmath107 ( e.g. , strain , entropy , magnetization , polarization , particle number ) with a conjugate thermodynamic force @xmath108 ( e.g. , stress , temperature , magnetic field , electric field , chemical potential ) , it generally follows from the convexity of the free energy that @xmath109 .",
    "however , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , if the system occupies a metastable state , an increase ( or decrease ) in @xmath108 may force the system to decay to the thermodynamic equilibrium . if this results in a decrease ( or increase ) in the observed value of @xmath107 , the transition will exhibit an inverted response in which @xmath110 ( e.g. , inverted compressibility , heat - capacity , magnetic susceptibility , electric susceptibility , chemical hardness transitions ) .",
    "we thus suggest that the negative compressibility transitions analyzed here will have analogues in other thermodynamic properties , which may inspire the design of yet new classes of metamaterials with unusual properties .",
    "this work was supported by an nsf graduate research fellowship and the nsf grant no .",
    "we define the temperature scale @xmath54 by setting @xmath111 equal to the energy barrier separating the coupled and decoupled minima of the potential energy at the tension for which the values of these two minima are equal ( i.e. , the point at which the equilibrium phase transition would occur in the limit of small temperature ) .",
