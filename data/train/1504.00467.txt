    "the first massive gravity formulation was done at the linear level by fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "this first attempt failed after comparing its predictions with the solar system observations .",
    "the reason for the failure of the theory at this level is the additional attractive effect due to the coupling between the scalar component and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this coupling remains even at the mass - less limit and it is known as the vdvz discontinuity @xcite . then after vainshtein proposed that it is possible to recover the predictions of gr at scales near the source if we consider a non - linear formulation of massive gravity instead of the standard linear version @xcite .",
    "introducing non - linearities however , makes the theory pathological due to the appearance of a ghost @xcite .",
    "in fact , the recovery of gr at scales of the solar system was due to the presence of this ghost since the negative kinetic energy term reproduced by the ghost exactly cancels the positive kinetic energy contribution coming from the scalar component .",
    "the details about this physical fact are explained in @xcite . due to the presence of a ghost , the non - linear theory was considered pathological .",
    "later de - rham , gabadadze and tolley discovered that by tuning in an appropriate way the different parameters of the potential , it was then possible to reproduce a ghost - free formulation of massive gravity .",
    "the essential idea is that the pathological terms of the action , after being grouped with higher order terms , are total derivatives and they will never appear in the equations of motion .",
    "the theory formulated in this way is called drgt @xcite . inside this theory , the recovery of gr at scales of the solar system is due to the non - linearities , relevant below the vainshtein scale which is approximately @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "the author formulated the vainshtein mechanism in terms of stckelberg functions .",
    "the vainshtein scale then appeared as an extremal condition of the dynamical metric in unitary gauge .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the scale is an extremal condition of the massive action . in this manuscript",
    ", i use this formulation in order to explain for which set of parameters it is possible to expect the vainshtein mechanism to operate and for which set of parameters , the mechanism is absent .",
    "the theory has generically three free - parameters , namely , the graviton mass , and the two free - parameters of the potential . by imposing the schwarzschild de - sitter background condition ,",
    "the number of free - parameters is reduced to two .",
    "if we fix the graviton mass parameter , then we can define an effective vainshtein scale . for the set of parameters where this scale vanishes or becomes smaller than the gravitational radius @xmath1 , the mechanism must be absent . on the other hand , for the set of parameters where the mechanism appears",
    ", the effective vainshtein scale must be finite .",
    "if it becomes infinite , then the screening mechanism should appear at any scale larger than @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative point of view is to set the vainshtein scale as an invariant .",
    "then we can define an effective graviton mass . at scales where the effective graviton mass almost vanishes",
    ", the mechanism should be expected to be absent and the massive gravitons can propagate freely everywhere . on the other hand ,",
    "if the effective graviton mass is finite , the mechanism must appear .",
    "if the effective graviton mass is infinite , then the massive gravitons can not propagate so far and then gr can in principle be recovered . in order to prove the consistency of these previous statements , i analyze the effective graviton mass for the different modes separately , namely , scalar , vectorial and the purely radial component in a free - falling frame of reference .",
    "in such a case , the analysis is more transparent and it also takes into account the role of the stckelberg function when the family of solutions with one free - parameter is analyzed @xcite .",
    "the black - hole solutions inside the non - linear formulation were already found in @xcite . the simplest and most generic solution for the spherically symmetric solution , was found in @xcite .",
    "all the solutions satisfying the stationary condition , are defined as :    @xmath2    where :    @xmath3    and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the scale factor which depends on the free - parameters of the theory . in this previous solution ,",
    "all the degrees of freedom are inside the dynamical metric . here",
    "we are in unitary gauge and then the fiducial metric is :    @xmath6    the solution ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) is equivalent to :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 corresponds to the stckelberg function .",
    "the non - triviality of @xmath8 contains the information of the extra - degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated in @xcite , that @xmath8 represents a preferred time - direction of the theory when the extra - degrees of freedom become relevant .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : drgt metric2 ] ) can be classified in two families .      for this family of solutions ,",
    "the stckelberg function is also a parameter . in other words",
    ", there is no rule or constraint telling us how this function should be specified .",
    "then in reality we still have two free - parameters , namely , one inside the potential and another represented by @xmath8 , which has a non - trivial relation with the graviton mass . for this case",
    ", the relation between the cosmological constant @xmath9 and the graviton mass , is given by @xcite :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 corresponds to the free - parameter of the massive action in agreement with the notation given in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the parameters of the massive action is defined in agreement with the condition @xmath12 .",
    "the result ( [ eq : cosmolala ] ) is telling us that the graviton mass is another free - parameter and its dependence with respect to @xmath11 must take the form @xmath13 if we want to keep @xmath9 as a fundamental constant . here",
    "however , i want to keep the vainshtein scale ( not the cosmological constant ) as an invariant quantity . in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite ,",
    "the equivalence principle is not satisfied for this family of solutions due to the preferred notion of time in agreement with the function @xmath8 .",
    "the equivalence principle is only satisfied if @xmath14 and this is equivalent to the absence of the extra - degrees of freedom for this family of solutions .      for the family of solutions with two free - parameters and the stckelberg function constrained ,",
    "the relation between the cosmological constant and the graviton mass is given by @xcite :    @xmath15    depending on the interpretation of the theory , the cosmological constant can be zero if we fix the graviton mass as an invariant .",
    "if however , what we keep as an invariant is the cosmological constant , then the value taken by the graviton mass might change .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath16 can give us a zero @xmath9 value or an infinite graviton mass , depending on the point of view .",
    "independent of the interpretation used , the stckelberg function has to satisfy the constraint @xcite :    @xmath17    a global solution of this previous constraint , is given by the finkelstein - type form @xcite :    @xmath18    for the family of solutions with one free - parameter but with the stckelberg function arbitrary , in principle there is no clear solution for @xmath8 .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath8 was considered as pathological for the perturbative analysis considered in @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation , was however considered in @xcite .",
    "the connection of this arbitrariness with the higgs mechanism at the graviton level was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "note that interestingly , for the family of solutions analyzed in this section , the equivalence principle is recovered .",
    "in fact , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tzero ] ) , it is easy to demonstrate that @xmath14 if @xmath19 . then , for the first family of solutions ( one free - paramater ) , we can conclude that the equivalence principle is in reality hidden . in other words , the principle which is absent from the family of solutions with one free - parameter and @xmath8 arbitrary , is recovered when we select as free - parameters those inside the massive action @xcite .",
    "note that the stckelberg function depends on the graviton mass through the function @xmath20 defined previously .",
    "then the arbitrariness on @xmath8 defined for the previous family of solutions , is equivalent to an arbitrariness on the graviton mass value .",
    "then for the first family of solutions , the two free - parameters are the graviton mass and @xmath11 .",
    "the vainshtein conditions were derived originally by the author in @xcite .",
    "they express the vainshtein scale as an extremal condition of the dynamical metric .",
    "this result helps us to find a relation between the stckelberg function @xmath8 and the function @xmath20 contained inside the components of the dynamical metric .",
    "the key relations are :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 being the vainshtein scale .",
    "the vanishing condition @xmath14 , guarantees the recovery of gr in the usual schwarzschild - like coordinates .",
    "the same set of relations , could also be derived from the most direct condition @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the result is independent of the exact form of the potential @xmath24 .",
    "the vainshtein scale , corresponding to an extremal conditions of the dynamical metric , can also be derived directly from the potential @xmath25 as has been explained in the previous section .",
    "the key point is to understand that in unitary gauge , namely , when all the degrees of freedom ( nambu - goldstone bosons ) are inside the dynamical metric ( eaten up by the dynamical metric ) , then any variation of the potential , is directly related to the variations on the dynamical metric .",
    "the relevant mathematical condition is @xcite :    @xmath26    the importance of the vainshtein conditions is that the details of the potential are not relevant at all in order to derive the vainshtein scale .",
    "all the information about the vainshtein scale is contained inside the dynamical metric if it contains all the degrees of freedom . for stationary cases , where the metric components are time - independent ,",
    "then eq . ( [ eq : ptm ] ) becomes :    @xmath27    and this is just equivalent to :    @xmath28    if the matrix @xmath29 is non - singular .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : this one ] ) , has to be satisfied by each component of the metric containing the information of the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "the conditions are valid at the vainshtein scale",
    ". then whenever we want to calculate the vainshtein radius of the theory , all what we have to do is to translate all the degrees of freedom to the dynamical metric and then apply the conditions ( [ eq : this one ] ) and finally solve algebraically for @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "here i derive the effective vainshtein scale for the two type of solutions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the first solution to be considered is the one with one free - parameter but with the stckelberg function arbitrary . in this case , in principle",
    "there is no correspondence between @xmath8 and the metric function @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamical metric in unitary gauge takes the explicit form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) but taking into account that @xmath8 is in principle arbitrary .",
    "then although the location of the vainshtein scale in terms of the stckelberg function is not clear at all , we can assume that the vainshtein conditions can still be applied to the dynamical metric , providing then the information about the location of the scale after which the effects of accelerated expansion have to be taken into account .",
    "for the stationary case , in agreement with @xcite , we can define the effective vainshtein scale as :    @xmath31    @xmath32    this is an effective value of the vainshtein radius depending on the free - parameters of the theory . in this case however , the possible effects of the stckelberg function @xmath33 have not been taken into account . later in this manuscript",
    "i will analyze the role of @xmath8 but inside the definition of effective graviton mass . the analysis done in sec .",

    "the vainshtein scale has a minimum for @xmath35 .",

    "however , if we analyze term by term in the function @xmath20 , given in terms of @xmath11 by :    @xmath39    then it is clear that gr is recovered everywhere for @xmath34 .",
    "however , for @xmath40 , the newtonian term @xmath41 becomes dominant , rescaling the effective newtonian constant and making gravity very strong and attractive .",
    "then the effective schwarzschild radius ( gravitational radius ) becomes very large .",
    "this means that even if the vainshtein mechanism operates everywhere outside the gravitational radius , this part of the solution is unphysical from the experimental point of view .",
    "however , the main point here is that as far as the vainshtein scale is non - zero , the mechanism is able to operate outside the gravitational radius .",

    "the peaks in such a case , can be interpreted as the combination of parameters for which the mode becomes heavy and does not propagate so far .",
    "this is equivalent to a screening mechanism effect .",
    "in addition , we can observe that the peaks for the vectorial component are not so large .",
    "this means that the vectorial modes in this case can propagate freely for most of the parameter combinations of the theory .",

    "here i have derived the simplest method in order to predict whether the vainshtein screening mechanism might appear for some specific parameter combinations of the theory .",
    "the method is based on the vainshtein conditions derived by the author in @xcite .",
    "the details of the potential are not important for the present analysis . the regions where the vainshtein mechanism operates are not necessarily relevant from the the physical point of view .",
    "this means that the conditions derived in this manuscript are necessary but not sufficient in order to guarantee the recovery of gr .",
    "the recovery of gr not only implies the predictions at the solar system scale but also the predictions related to the physics of black - holes . in @xcite for example , it was discovered that some parameter combinations can reproduce branch point effects when we analyze the periodicity structure of the propagators .",
    "this manuscript is developed by using two equivalent points of view .",
    "the first one is worked by fixing the graviton mass and then deriving an effective vainshtein scale .",
    "the second point of view is developed by fixing the vainshtein scale and then deriving an effective version of the graviton mass . here",
    "i consider that both points of view are physically equivalent and considering one or the other is a matter of choice . finally in order to perform a rigorous analysis , i have studied the behavior of the effective mass for each of the modes , namely , scalar , vectorial and radial . in this case",
    "i have also maintained the effective vainshtein scale as an invariant .",
    "the analysis revealed that the mass for the different modes can behave in a different way depending on the parameter combinations considered .",
    "in other words , although from the qualitative point of view some cases look similar , the detailed study revealed that the effective mass for the different modes are not the same in general .",
    "in particular the scalar and radial modes have the same effective mass for the case of two free - parameters and @xmath8 constrained .",
    "in such a case , only the vectorial component behaves different .",
    "however , if we look at the case with one free - parameter and @xmath8 arbitrary , then the different modes behave different when we look at them in detail .",
    "however , even in this situation , the scalar and radial components have similar behavior .",
    "the difference comes from the behavior with respect to the arbitrary stckelberg function .",
    "in fact , this function defines the direction of the preferred notion of time . it would be interesting to extend these ideas to other solutions like the ones proposed in @xcite among others , where other gravitational contributions might appear .",
    "the method could also be extended for the analysis of more complicated solutions like the kerr one , discovered recently inside the massive gravity formulations @xcite .",
    "for the case of solutions containing the time variable inside the metric components , the vainshtein conditions ( [ eq : ptm ] ) can not ignore the time variation in such a case . then the parameter combinations where the vainshtein ( screening ) mechanism appears might change with time .",
