    "in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics there exist two annihilation reactions that have become prominent model systems .",
    "these are the pair annihilation processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "interest in fluctuation effects on the first reaction process dates back to the seminal work by smoluchowski @xcite , and in more recent times at least to bramson and griffeath @xcite ; and for the second process fluctuations were first studied by ovchinnikov and zeldovich @xcite .",
    "the final states of both processes are trivial : all particles ( save perhaps a single one ) disappear in the case of @xmath14 , and only the excess number of particles of the initial majority species is left in the case of @xmath11 .",
    "the nature of the approach to the final state is , however , nontrivial and has been the subject of many investigations .",
    "the @xmath14 problem applies , for example , to domain walls in a one - dimensional system like in the zero - temperature ising model @xcite .",
    "its asymptotic behavior is the same as that of the diffusion - limited coagulation process @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the ensuing asymptotic density decay @xmath16 has been experimentally observed ( in an intermediate time window ) in the fusion kinetics of laser - induced excitons in quasi one - dimensional n(ch@xmath17)@xmath18mncl@xmath17 ( tmmc ) polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the study of the two - species annihilation reaction @xmath11 was motivated originally by the cosmological problem of matter - antimatter annihilation .",
    "ovchinnikov and zeldovich @xcite , and independently a few years later toussaint and wilczek @xcite , asked whether in such a simple annihilation model it would be possible that locally in space only , say , matter would be left .",
    "the answer rapidly turned out to be positive : the @xmath11 system exhibits the phenomenon of species `` segregation '' , that is , the emergence of ever growing single - species domains ( either @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) . as a result , after a short initial period , annihilation takes place only in `` reaction zones '' where the domains border , and the decay of the total density is slowed down markedly .",
    "indeed , a non - classical decay @xmath21 has been experimentally confirmed in three dimensions in a calcium / fluorophore reaction system @xcite .",
    "the condition for segregation to occur is that the spatial dimension @xmath22 be less than the critical _ segregation dimension _ @xmath8 , which in the case of @xmath11 is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "early work on this two - species problem was done by kang and redner @xcite ; clever heuristic reasoning and numerical work on the spatial structure of the domains is due to leyvraz and redner @xcite ; and rigorous results were derived by bramson and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group approach to the reaction @xmath14 was pursued by peliti @xcite and lee @xcite , and to the process @xmath11 by lee and cardy @xcite , and oerding @xcite .",
    "the strong interest in these two reactions has sparked off research on many related reaction - diffusion problems by various techniques .",

    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .    in 1986 ben - avraham and redner @xcite , crediting kang , introduced a @xmath0-species pair annihilation problem that interpolates between these two models , and hence puts them in a common perspective .",
    "they considered a system of @xmath0 distinct particle species @xmath24 , all propagating with the same difffusion constant , and reacting according to @xmath25 with a single fixed rate . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 this @xmath0-species",

    "( for the latter case , note that the probability of identical species to meet becomes vanishingly small in the limit of @xmath28 ; hence any particle encounter will lead to a reaction , and the distinction of different species becomes meaningless . )",

    "[ secconclusion ] .",
    "our considerations allow us to answer another question as well : in the two - species @xmath11 system the appearance of segregation is usually explained heuristically through arguments invoking the local conservation of the difference between the number of @xmath19 and @xmath20 particles .",
    "this conservation law thus seemed to be at the origin of the segregation phenomenon .",
    "however , the discovery @xcite that the one - dimensional mam exhibits segregation for all @xmath49 , even though it is not subject to any conservation law , cast doubt upon this apparent direct link between conservation laws and segregation .",
    "this doubt was subsequently reenforced by a heuristic argument according to which the mam should exhibit segregation in the entire region of the @xmath0-@xmath33 plane delimited by @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "( the only weakness of this argument is that the region concerned by it does not contain any points with integer `` physical '' @xmath0 and @xmath33 , except for @xmath26 , where the conservation law applies . )",
    "this present work clarifies this issue : we show that the existence of a conservation law , although a _ sufficient _ condition for segregation in dimensions @xmath52 , does _ not _ constitute a _ necessary _ condition : segregation may in fact occur in the absence of any conservation law .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 distinct diffusing particle species @xmath53 subject to the pair annihilation reactions @xmath54 here the @xmath55 represent the reaction rates per unit of density ; they are constrained only by the requirements that they be non - negative and that there exist a symmetry operation under which all particle species are equivalent .",
    "we will set @xmath4 , implying that no self - annihilation is possible . without loss of generality we may consider the matrix @xmath7 to be irreducible , _",
    "i.e. _ , the system of reactants can not be decomposed into mutually noninteracting subsystems .",

    "our focus will be on the power law for the density decay , @xmath36 , and on the segregation properties of this system .",
    "straightforward scaling analysis tells us that for pair annihilation processes such as considered here , very generally mean - field theory is applicable in spatial dimensions @xmath56 , and , likely with logarithmic corrections , at the upper critical dimension @xmath57 .",
    "we shall operate entirely at the mean - field level , and hence our results will concern dimensions @xmath58 . in our discussion",
    "we will briefly touch upon implications for lower dimensions @xmath59 .",
    "note that the system of reactions ( [ reactioneqns ] ) may be visualized as a graph @xmath60 with @xmath0 vertices representing the @xmath0 species , in which bonds carrying weights @xmath3 connect the vertices of pairs of species that may react with each other . at certain points in our discussion",
