    "the scalar component of primordial perturbations of the universe can be detected by the maps of temperature fluctuations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , while the tensor component of the primordial perturbations has to be probed by the maps of the stokes parameter @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the linear polarization of the cmbr .",
    "a tensor field generally contains electric - like @xmath0-mode and magnetic - like @xmath1-modes . in the linear regime ,",
    "vortical mode of primordial perturbations do not grow during the clustering of density field , and therefore , the perturbed field initially has to be curl - free .",
    "that is , the primordial perturbations can only yield the @xmath0-mode , but not @xmath1-mode of the cmbr polarization field . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1-mode perturbations can be produced by gravitational waves .",
    "therefore , extracting the @xmath1-mode information from cmbr polarization maps is crucial to verify the existence of gravitational wave background produced at the inflationary epoch .",
    "moreover , gravitational lensing of clusters and hot electron scattering of reionization would be able to yield both @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes . to study these problems a sharp decomposition of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes from @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps",
    "is required .",
    "if both @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps are available over the whole sky , one can find the whole sky maps of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes with the spherical harmonic decomposition , because the relation between the maps of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) in the space spanned by bases of spin two harmonics is local ( kamionkowsky et al .",
    "1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "however , the observed maps can not be global ; it is always limited by the contamination of our galaxy and other foreground sources .",
    "the relation between the maps of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) in physical space contains the laplace operator , and therefore , it is non - local",
    ". the @xmath5 decomposition with the spatially - limited maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 will not be unique if we lack of information of the polarization and its derivative on the boundary of the maps .    for noiseless samples , the problem of uniqueness",
    "would be solved by constructing orthogonal modes with window functions to fit the requirements of boundary conditions ( lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; bunn et al .",
    "2003 ; smith 2006 ; smith & zaldarriaga 2007 ) .",
    "it is , however , similar to the domain ( or windowed ) fourier analysis .",
    "the result will not be useful to study the structures in physical space ( e.g. chiueh & ma 2002 ) .",
    "the other challenge caused by the derivative operator is because the @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps are discrete .",
    "mathematically , the derivative operators @xmath6 or @xmath7 are continuous linear operators mapping functions defined in hilbert space , while the observed samples @xmath2 and @xmath3 actually are defined in space spanned by base @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which is a set of finite indices .",
    "this difference leads to large numerical errors when the discrete maps are noisy .",
    "the last , but not least , problem is from the smallness of @xmath1-modes . on the scale of one degree order ,",
    "the power of @xmath1-mode caused by gravitational waves at inflationary epoch is less than that of @xmath0-modes by a factor of at least 10@xmath4 .",
    "as the maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are random fields , the variance of the random fields will lead to the mixing of @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes .",
    "consequently , @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes would be contaminated from each other .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to recover the power of @xmath1-mode if the powers of @xmath0 modes are much larger than that of @xmath1 modes .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an algorithm of the @xmath5 decomposition based on the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) analysis , which is a compromise between the decompositions in physical space and scale space .",
    "the dwt analysis of the cmbr temperature fluctuation maps has attracted much attention in the last decade ( pando et al .",
    "1998 ; sanz et al .",
    "1999 ; mukherjee et al .",
    "2000 ) . besides these points",
    ", we especially take the advantage of the so - called wavelet - galerkin discretization ( e.g. louis et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is to approximate derivative operator to a matrix in space spanned by wavelet bases .",
    "for some available wavelets , the matrixes are exactly diagonal in scale - space , and narrowly banded in spatial space .",
    "this made the uncertainties from boundary , noises and variances are under control .",
    "we will study the conditions , under which the information of small @xmath1-mode can approximately be extracted from noisy maps of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the method of the @xmath5 separation in the dwt space .",
    "section 3 tests the dwt algorithm with samples with known spatial structures .",
    "we show that the method effectively to suppresses the uncertainties from boundary effect and noise .",

    "we first take a wavelet - galerkin discretization of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to rewrite these equations in the dwt space .",
    "we can assume that the patch is a @xmath18 square .",
    "the size of each pixel is @xmath19 , @xmath20 being a integral , one can project the maps into the dwt space by @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is orthogonal scaling function on scale @xmath20 ( e.g. fang & thews 1998 ) .",

    "we can construct the noise maps of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "first , with eq.(25 ) we can show @xmath110 that is , noise eq.(25 ) does not cause false correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes .",

    "that is , in the daubechies 6 dwt algorithm [ eqs(16 ) and ( 17 ) ] , the operator of derivative @xmath121 does not significantly change the level of the noise , while the operator for @xmath122 leads to an increase of the variance by a factor of 5 with respect to the variance of @xmath99 and @xmath100 maps .",
    "this shows that derivative will generally amplify the effect of noise .",
    "however , the matrix @xmath59 is exactly diagonal with respect to @xmath78 , the derivative operator in the dwt representation does not transfer the noise from one scale to others . in this sense",
    ", we have a handle on the noise .    as noise and signal",
    "are statistically uncorrelated , the power spectrum of @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be reconstructed by subtracting the power of noise as @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the dwt power spectrum of maps @xmath123 and @xmath124 given by eqs.(16 ) and ( 17 ) , respectively , using noisy @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "the algorithm of subtracting the noise dwt power spectrum @xmath131 and @xmath132 scale - by - scale is similar to the subtraction of shot noise power from the dwt power spectrum of galaxy survey ( fang & feng 2000 ) .      for a sample of finite area , the dwt power spectrum analysis does not need a window function to treat the spatial domain .",
    "the effect of boundary can effectively be reduced by dropping the dwt variables related to cells @xmath133 located on or near the boundary ( pando & fang 1998 ) .",
    "when derivative operators , @xmath6 , @xmath134 , are involved , the boundary effect would be more serious , because the matrix of derivative operators in the dwt representation is not exactly diagonal with respect to the spatial index @xmath27 .",
    "nevertheless , the matrix @xmath59 [ eq.(11 ) ] is narrowly banded , the effect of boundary can still be reduced by dropping boundary modes .",

    "this comparison is only to test the discretization of derivative operator , but says nothing about the amount of information loss associated with the algorithm .",

    "<S> it also reveals that if the @xmath2 and @xmath3 maps are random , these fields lead to the mixing of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the @xmath1 mode will be contaminated if the powers of @xmath0 modes are much larger than that of @xmath1 modes . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , numerical tests show that the power spectra of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on scales larger than the finest scale by a factor of 4 and higher can reasonably be recovered , even when the power ratio of @xmath0- to @xmath1-modes is as large as about 10@xmath4 , and the signal - to - noise ratio is equal to 10 and higher . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the galerkin discretization is free of false correlations , and keeps the contamination under control . </S>",
    "<S> as wavelet variables contain information of both spatial and scale spaces , the developed method is also effective to recover the spatial structures of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mode fields . </S>"
