    "the recent observations of type ia distant supernovae indicate that our universe is currently accelerating @xcite .",
    "there are different proposals for explaining this phenomenon .",
    "some of them are based on assumptions of standard cosmological models , which utilize frw metric .",
    "thus possible explanations include : cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite , a decaying vacuum energy density @xcite , an evolving scalar field or quintessence models @xcite , a phantom energy ( expressed in terms of the barotropic equation of state violating the weak energy condition ) @xcite , dark energy in the form of chaplygin gas @xcite , etc .. all these conceptions propose some kind of new matter of unknown origin which violate the strong energy condition .",
    "the universe is currently accelerating due to the presence of these dark energy components",
    ".    on the other hand , there are alternative ideas of explanation , in which instead of dark energy some modifications of friedmann s equation are proposed at the very beginning . in these approaches some effects arising from new physics like brane cosmologies , quantum effects , anisotropy effects etc . can mimic dark energy by a modification of friedmann equation .",
    "freese & lewis @xcite have shown that contributions of type @xmath5 to friedmann s equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy density and @xmath1 a constant , may describe such situations phenomenologically .",
    "these models ( by their authors called the cardassian models ) give rise to acceleration , although the universe is flat and contains the usual matter and radiation without any dark energy components . in the authors opinion @xcite , what is still lacking is a fundamental theory ( like general relativity ) from which these models can be derived after postulating robertson walker ( r - w ) symmetry .",
    "we argue that a possible candidate for such a fundamental theory can be provided by non - linear gravity theories ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and , particularly , the so - called @xmath8- theories @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that if one imposes the energy - momentum conservation condition then matter density is parametrized by the scale factor ( in a case of r - w symmetry ) , and cardassian term @xmath5 in the friedmann equation will be reproduced .",
    "there are different theoretical attempts to modify gravity in order to achieve an accelerating cosmic expansion at the present epoch .",
    "already in the paper by carroll et  al .",
    "@xcite , one can find interesting modifications of the einstein - hilbert action with lagrangian density @xmath9 .",
    "those authors have shown that in the generic case cosmological models admit , at late time , a de sitter solution , which is unfortunately unstable .",
    "moreover , carroll et  al .",
    "have demonstrated the existence of an interesting set of attractors , which seem to be important in the context of the dark energy problem .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to set up observational constraints on parameters of cosmological models inspired by non - linear gravity .",
    "the possibility of explaning cosmic acceleration in terms of nonlinear generalization of the einstein equation has been previously addressed in @xcite .",
    "however , these authors have not confronted their models with observational data .",
    "this problem has been tackled in @xcite , where nonlinear power law lagrangians were compared with snia data and x ray gas mass fraction as well ( see also @xcite for a more general class of lagrangians ) . here , we use samples of supernovae ia @xcite together with the baryon oscillation test @xcite for stringent and deeper constraint on model parameters .",
    "we check to which extent the predictions of our model are consistent with the current observational data .",
    "severe constraints on the particular modifications of gravity considered in this paper have been already proposed @xcite . on the other hand , in the article by clifton and barrow @xcite , strong constraints coming from nucleosynthesis of light elements",
    "have been found within a higher - order gravity .",
    "therefore , it is possible that our model ( although a first - order ) , which fits snia data well can be ruled out by nucleosynthesis arguments .",
    "assuming frw dynamics in which dark energy is present , the basic equation determining a cosmic evolution has the form of a generalized friedmann equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the effective energy density of several `` fluids '' , parametrized by the scale factor @xmath12 , while @xmath13 denotes the spatial curvature index .",
    "one can reformulate ( [ eq:1 ] ) in terms of density parameters @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 is the density parameter for the ( baryonic and dark ) matter , scaling like @xmath18 , while @xmath19 describes the dark energy @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ( the present value of the scale factor which we further on normalize to unity ) , one obtains the constraint @xmath22 .",
    "we can certainly assume that the energy density ( @xmath23 ) satisfies the conservation condition @xmath24 for each component of the fluid , so that @xmath25",
    ". then from  ( [ eq:2 ] ) one gets the constraint relation @xmath26 for the present values ( @xmath27 ) of the density parameters .",
    "all approaches mentioned above lead toward a description of dark energy in the framework of standard frw cosmology .",
    "it will be demonstrated , in the next section , that all cosmological models of the first - order non - linear gravity which satisfy r - w symmetry , can also be reduced to the familiar form ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effects of nonlinear gravity can mimic dynamical effects of dark energy .",
    "for the cosmological applications one chooses the friedmann - robertson - walker metric , which ( in spherical coordinates ) takes the standard form : @xmath28\\ .",
    "\\label{rw1}\\ ] ] as before , @xmath29 denotes the scale factor and @xmath30 the spatial curvature ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "another main ingredient of all cosmological models is a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor , expressed by @xmath32 one requires the standard relations between the pressure @xmath33 , the matter density @xmath7 , the equation of state parameter @xmath34 and the expansion factor @xmath35 , namely @xmath36    let us consider the action functional @xmath37 within the first order palatini formalism @xcite . in fact , from now on we shall assume the simplest power law gravitational lagrangian of the form @xmath38 where one fixes the constant @xmath39 to be positive ( it has the same dimension as @xmath40 ) .",
    "we want to point out that our model is singular for @xmath41 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such models are exactly solvable for the matter stress - energy tensor representing a single perfect fluid of a kind @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "( [ pro ] ) ) .",
    "their confrontation with experimental data has been performed , for a dust filled universe , in @xcite .",
    "here we attempt to continue the analysis with newly available astier snia samples and new baryon oscillation tests .",
    "these allow us to strengthen the admissible constraints on model parameters .",
    "moreover , we extend our research to a matter stress - energy tensor containing two components , both with @xmath42 : a perfect fluid @xmath43 and a radiation @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that the presence of the radiation term crucially changes the dynamics of our model at the early stage of its evolution .",
    "in addition , as to be demonstrated in section iii , although one can not obtain better constraints from snia data , the combined analysis of snia and baryon oscillations offers a new possibility for a deeper determination of model parameters .    following a method developed in @xcite , the hubble parameter for our model can be calculated to be : @xmath45 } \\left [   \\frac{\\kappa(1 - 3w ) \\eta_w}{\\beta } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\,a^{-\\frac{3(1+w)}{n}}+ \\nonumber \\\\ + \\frac{4n(2-n)\\kappa\\eta_{rad}}{3\\beta[3w(n-1)+(n-3)]^2 } \\left [   \\frac{\\kappa(1 - 3w ) \\eta_w}{\\beta } \\right]^{\\frac{1-n}{n}}\\,a^{-\\frac{n+3 + 3w(1-n)}{n } } - \\frac{k}{a^2}\\ , \\left [ \\frac{2n}{3w(n-1)+(n-3 ) } \\right]^2 \\ . \\label{mfrn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( since radiation is already included in ( [ mfrn ] ) , one has to assume @xmath46 . )",
    "it is worth pointing out that the deceleration parameter , in the case @xmath47 , equals to ( see @xcite ) : @xmath48 thus , the effective equation of state parameter @xmath49 is @xmath50 let us observe that , in the case @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the same values of @xmath53 and @xmath49 can also be achieved as asymptotic values @xmath54 . in the early universe , when the scale factor goes to the initial singularity , the radiation term , in ( [ mfrn ] ) scaling like @xmath55 , will dominate over the dust term ( scaling like @xmath56 ) . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath57 or @xmath58 , then the negative radiation term can not dominate over the matter , so that instead of the initial singularity we obtain a bounce . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath12 goes to infinity , the radiation becomes negligible versus to the matter .    in our further analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath59 i.e. , more precisely , to the spatially flat universe filled with dust and radiation . thus ( 8) , ( remarking once more that all @xmath60 s are positive constants ) becomes @xmath61^{1 \\over",
    "n } a^{-\\frac{3}{n}}\\,+ \\frac{4n(2-n)\\kappa\\eta_{rad}}{3\\beta(n-3)^2 } \\left[\\frac{\\eta_{dust}\\kappa}{\\beta } \\right]^{1-n \\over n } a^{-\\frac{n+3}{n } } -\\frac{4 k n^2}{(n-3)^2}\\,a^{-2 } \\ . \\label{frv1}\\ ] ] one should immediately note that this expression , representing the squared hubble parameter , reproduces in the case @xmath62  as expected  the standard friedmann equation .",
    "we would like to emphasize also that ( 11 ) becomes singular at @xmath63 . + it is convenient to rewrite relation ( 11 ) is such a way that all coefficients are dimensionless ( density parameters ) .",
    "then , the effects of the matter scaling like @xmath64 , and the radiation scaling like @xmath65 , can be separated from the effects of the nonlinear generalization of einstein gravity ( @xmath66 ) :    @xmath67    here : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 while @xmath71 denotes the present - day value of the hubble function .",
    "let us observe that @xmath72 can be determined also from the constraint @xmath73 , which easily reduces to : @xmath74    the relation ( [ eq:12a ] ) has the form of friedmann s first integral .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the model can be naturally rewritten in terms of a 2d dynamical system of newtonian type .",
    "its hamiltonian is :    @xmath75    while the corresponding equations of motion are :    @xmath76    the overdot differentiats now with respect to the rescaled time variable @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 , while @xmath79 is a potential function for the scale factor @xmath12 expressed in units of its present value @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 , then the potential function is given by the general formula    @xmath82    for example , the potential function for our model writes as ( @xmath80 ) :    @xmath83 \\omega_{nonl,0}\\,a^{\\frac{3}{n}\\left(1-n\\right ) } \\ .",
    "% + \\omega_{k,0}\\frac{4n^2}{\\left(n-3\\right)^2 \\label{eq:16}\\ ] ]    recently , in carloni et al @xcite , the cosmological dynamics of @xmath84 gravity has been treated in a different phase space with the use of qualitative methods for dynamical systems .",
    "the phase portraits for the @xmath4cdm model versus our model with fitted values of @xmath85 parameters ( see the next section ) are illustrated on figures 1 and 2 .",
    "both models are topologically inequivalent : the phase portrait of @xmath4cdm has a structurally stable saddle critical point , while with nonlinear gravity one obtains a center . as well - known , the critical point of a center type is structurally unstable and all trajectories around this point represent the models , which oscillate without initial and final singularities .",
    "it is interesting that ( [ eq:12a ] ) after a time reparametrization following the rule : @xmath86 is equivalent to the standard cosmological model with matter and radiation , with rescaled values of the corresponding density parameters @xmath2 and @xmath87 .",
    "the geometry of the potential function offers the possibility to investigate the remaining models . on",
    "can simply establish some general relation between the geometry of the potential function and critical points of the newtonian systems .",
    "in any case , the critical points lie on the @xmath12-axis , i.e. they represent the static solution @xmath88 so that @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is a strict local maximum of @xmath79 , it is of the saddle type .",
    "if @xmath90 is a strict local minimum of the analytical function @xmath79 , it is a centre .",
    "if @xmath90 is a horizontal inflection point of the @xmath79 , it is a cusp .    from the fitting procedure we obtain @xmath91",
    ", so the second term in the potential function is negative ( in contrast to the first term which is positive ) . because the negative radiation term in ( [ eq:16 ] ) can not dominate the first one ( @xmath92 ) , there is the characteristic bounce behavior rather than the initial singularity in the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "moreover , during the bouncing phase the universe is accelerating , while for late times it becomes matter dominated and decelerates .",
    "type ia distant supernova surveys suggest that the present universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "every year new snia enlarge the available data by more distant objects and lower systematics errors .",
    "riess et al .",
    "@xcite have compiled samples which become the standard data sets of snia .",
    "one of them , the restricted `` gold '' sample of 157 snia , is used in our analysis .",
    "recently astier et al .",
    "@xcite have compiled a new sample of supernovae , based on 71 high redshifted snia discovered during the first year of supernovae legacy survey .",
    "this latest sample of 115 supernovae is used as our basic sample .    for distant snia one can directly observe their apparent magnitude @xmath93 and redshift @xmath94 . because the absolute magnitude @xmath95 is related to the absolute luminosity @xmath96 , the relation between luminosity distance @xmath97 , the observed magnitude @xmath93 and the absolute magnitude @xmath95 has the following form @xmath98 it is convenient to use the dimensionless parameter @xmath99 @xmath100 instead of @xmath97 .",
    "then  ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath101 where @xmath102 we know the absolute magnitude of snia from its light curve .",
    "the luminosity distance of supernovae is a given function of the redshift : @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105    substituting ( [ eq:8 ] ) back into equations ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) provides us with an effective tool ( hubble diagram ) to test cosmological models and to constrain their parameters . assuming that supernovae measurements come with uncorrelated gaussian errors",
    ", one can determine the likelihood function @xmath106 from chi - square statistic @xmath107 , where @xmath108 the probability density function ( pdf in short ) of cosmological parameters @xcite can be derived from bayes theorem .",
    "therefore , one can estimate model parameters by using a minimization procedure .",
    "it is based on the likelihood function as well as on the best fit method minimizing @xmath109 .    for statistical analysis",
    "we have restricted the parameter @xmath2 to the interval @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath1 to @xmath111 $ ] ( except @xmath112 and additionally @xmath63 for @xmath113 ) . moreover , because of the singularity at @xmath114 ( see eq .",

    "one can observe systematic deviations between these models at higher redshifts .",
    "the non - linear gravity model predicts that high redshifted supernovae should be fainter than those predicted by the @xmath4cdm model .",

    "please note that we obtained different values of @xmath117 from the riess versus astier samples .",
    "it is because astier et al .",
    "assume the absolute magnitude @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "for comparison we present ( table 3 ) results of statistical analysis for the @xmath4cdm concordance model .",
    ".the flat non - linear gravity model with @xmath113 .",
    "results of statistical analysis performed on the astier versus the gold riess samples of snia obtained from @xmath109 best - fit .",

    "note that for both samples we obtain with aic and bic for the @xmath4cdm model smaller values than for non - linear gravity .",
    "we use a bayesian framework to compare the cosmological models , because they automatically penalize models with more parameters to fit the data .",
    "based on these simple information criteria , we find that the snia data still favour the @xmath4cdm model , because under a similar quality of the fit for both models , the @xmath4cdm contains fewer parameters .    it is interesting that both models give different predictions for the brightness of the distant supernovae ( see fig .",
    "the model of modified non - linear gravity predicts that very high redshift supernovae should be fainter than predicted by @xmath4cdm .",
    "so , we can expect future snia data to allow us discriminating finally between these two models .",
    "the main subject of our paper has been to confront the simplest class of non - linear gravity models versus the observation of distant type ia supernovae and the recent detection of the baryon acoustic peak in the sloan digital sky survey data .",
    "we find strong constraints on two independent model parameters ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "if we assume n=1 , then we obtain the standard einstein de sitter model filled by both matter and radiation .",
    "we estimate model parameters using standard minimization procedure based on the likelihood function as well as the best fit method . for deeper statistical analysis ,",
    "we have used aic and bic information criteria of model comparison and selection .",
    "our general conclusion is that non - linear gravity fits well ( both snia and baryon oscillation data ) .",
    "in particular we conclude :    1 .   analysis of snia astier data shows that values of @xmath109 statistic are comparable for both @xmath4cdm and best fitted non - linear gravity model .",
    "the non - linear gravity models with @xmath120 can be excluded by combined analysis of both snia data and baryon oscillation peak detected in the sdss luminous red galaxy survey of eisenstein at al .",

    "3 .   from snia data",
    "we obtain a weak dependence of the quality of fits on the value of density parameter for matter ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the combined analysis allowed only value of @xmath2 well tuned to its canonical value @xmath122 .",
    "this value of course is in good agreement with present extra - galactic data @xcite .",
    "we use the akaike and bayesian information criteria for comparison and discrimination between the analyzed models .",
    "we find these criteria still to favour the @xmath4cdm model over non - linear gravity , because ( under the similar quality of the fit for both models ) the @xmath4cdm model contains one parameter less .",
    "the hubble diagram implies that very high redshifted supernovae ( @xmath123 ) should be fainter in non - linear gravity model than those predicted by @xmath4cdm .",
    "so , future snia data can allow us finally to discriminate between these two models .",
    "the standard general relativity models with @xmath124 ( without cosmological constant ) can be excluded by snia data on @xmath125 level ( as the e - des model ) .",
    "the non - linear cosmology can therefore be treated as a serious alternative versus cosmology with dark energy of unknown nature .",
