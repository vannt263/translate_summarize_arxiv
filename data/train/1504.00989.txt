    "the morris - shore ( ms ) transformation  @xcite offers a theoretical framework to minimize the complexity in a variety of coherent excitation coupling linkages of a @xmath0-state quantum system  @xcite .",
    "often used in modeling laser - induced excitation of atoms , the ms transformation replaces the complex system by a set of independent two - state systems , decoupled from each other , and unlinked states . for example , when a degenerate two - state atom possessing angular momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , for the ground and excited levels , interacts with a laser field , the excitation degeneracy in the magnetic sub - levels results in various coupling linkages amongst @xmath3 levels , characterized by polarization states of the laser field .",
    "however , a consequence of the ms - transformation decoupling is that the @xmath4 hamiltonian that describes the coherent excitation is reduced to a set of @xmath5 sub - hamiltonians plus a diagonal matrix representing uncoupled dark or spectator states .",
    "so , the dynamics of such system can be described simply by a superposition of independent two - state dynamics , each of which undergoes a rabi oscillation between a pair of new ground and excited states defined in a factorized hilbert sub - space .",
    "the procedure of the ms transformation can be summarized as follows  @xcite .",
    "suppose an atomic system with @xmath6 ground levels and @xmath7 excited levels ( @xmath8 ) resonantly interacts with a laser field . under an assumption of no damping",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian is written in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa )  @xcite as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 coupling matrix between the ground and excited levels .",
    "then , the ms transformation theory predicts that the coupling matrix @xmath10 is diagonalized through a ms transformation given by @xmath12 where the unitary transformation @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 here the block matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the unitary transformations that diagonalize @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath19 is a direct sum of @xmath20 sets of two - state systems and @xmath21 uncoupled single states ( @xmath22 ) , _",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 s are the rabi frequencies , that are all different in general , of the two - state systems .",
    "various systems have been analyzed by the ms transformation  @xcite , which include two - state superposition systems  @xcite , three - state @xmath25-linkage systems  @xcite , four - state diamond- and tripod - linkage systems  @xcite , @xmath0-state @xmath20- and @xmath26-linkage systems  @xcite , to list a few .",
    "the ms transformation of three - state @xmath25-linkage systems is in particular interesting in regards to the laser technique called stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite , where the systems undergo an adiabatic evolution between ms - transformed coupled two states , leaving the dark state never populated during the laser interaction .",
    "the result is a complete population transfer ( cpt )  @xcite from one ground state to the other , which is easy to understand in the context of the ms transformation .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an experimental study of ms - transformed @xmath0-state systems performed by ultrafast laser - induced coherent excitations .",
    "the systems under consideration are the complex coupling linkages of the d1 and d2 transitions of atomic rubidium ( @xmath27rb ) .",
    "for example , the d1 transitions from @xmath28 to @xmath29 correspond to an @xmath30 system with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we first analyze the atomic rubidium systems in terms of the ms transformation to derive the rabi frequencies for the d1 and d2 transitions induced by an elliptically - polarized light in sec .",
    "ii . after briefly describing the experimental procedure in sec .",
    "iii , it is shown based on our experimental results that the system dynamics are all governed by a sum of at most two decoupled rabi oscillations  @xcite when these systems interact with ultrafast laser pulses of any polarization state . in sec .",
    "the implication of this result to possible controls of photo - electron polarizations is discussed before the conclusion in sec . v.",
    "we first consider a laser pulse in the linear or circular polarization state interacts with the atomic rubidium .",
    "suppose the polarized electric field is given by @xmath33 where the polarization vector @xmath34 or @xmath35 for the linear or circular polarization , respectively .",
    "the d1 transitions is dictated by the selection rule of @xmath36 or @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , so , for each @xmath39 , the hamiltonian can be written in the four - state basis @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the dipole moments are given by @xmath45 .",
    "since we consider ultrafast laser interactions , the interaction time is extremely short compared to the inverse of any hyperfine energy splitting , so the effective hamiltonian under a resonant approximation  @xcite can be alternatively written in the atomic frame as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath51 is assumed without loss of generality , the coupling matrix @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 and the ms transformation decouples the system into two independent two - state systems through diagonalizing the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 that are given by @xmath56 then , the coupling strength of each two - state system , or the square of each rabi frequency , is determined by the eigenvalues  @xcite given by    @xmath57    in the basis of the eigenvectors @xmath58 , an arbitrary ground state can be a pure superposition state or a mixed state of @xmath58 . if these two eigenvalues @xmath59 are the same , the two independent oscillators represented by @xmath58 vibrate coherently with the same rabi frequency , thus the cpt could occur . here",
    ", the condition for @xmath60 is given by @xmath61    as for the @xmath62 transitions ( @xmath63 ) , clebsch - gordon coefficient symmetries  @xcite allow @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for all @xmath68 , which satisfies @xmath60 and the rabi frequencies are the same for all @xmath39 s .",
    "therefore , the cpt of the total system occurs and , moreover , the system initially in any coherent - superposition or mixed ground - state simply undergoes simply a rabi oscillation with the rabi frequency given by @xmath69 the rabi oscillations in these complex degenerate - level manifolds have been observed in an implementation of single qubit operations of atomic rubidium  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for the @xmath70 transitions ( @xmath71 ) , the equality @xmath72 holds , which makes one of the eigenvalues zero and the other twice the eigenvalue of @xmath63 ( the @xmath62 transition ) . in other words , the @xmath70 transitions for different @xmath39 s have respectively a pair of uncoupled states and their rabi frequencies are @xmath73 times bigger than that of the corresponding @xmath62 transition .",
    "therefore , the temporal dynamics of @xmath74 transitions depend on the initial condition , unlike the @xmath62 transitions , since its oscillators are drastically different , which behavior has been applied to coherent controls of medium gains  @xcite .",
    "now we generalize the problem by considering elliptically polarizations of the laser interaction  @xcite .",
    "when the electric field is defined by @xmath75 the elements in @xmath10 are given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the transition dipole moment , @xmath78 .",
    "the dipole moments can be factorized by a common factor , @xmath79 for all @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "when the ellipticity @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 , the rabi frequencies are given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "when the hamiltonian is ms - transformed through the summarized procedure in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) , the resulting hamiltonian @xmath19 is a direct sum of twelve sets of two - state systems given by @xmath85 where the first set of six two - state systems corresponds to the @xmath86 transitions and the second to the @xmath87 transitions .",
    "this result can be readily understood in terms of the basis reduction from @xmath88 to @xmath89  @xcite . since spin interactions ( hyperfine interactions in this case )",
    "are irrelevant in ultrafast - time scale dynamics , they can be traced out , and the reduced basis description in @xmath89 can be alternatively acquired .",
    "the advantage for using the ms - transformed @xmath88 bases , instead of using the reduced basis set , comes from the fact that the coherent dynamics coupled with spin interactions can be directly seen in the former bases , implying applications to ultrafast time - scale nuclear - spin polarization controls  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig .",

    "the center wavelength of the laser pulses ( the pump pulse ) was tuned to 794.7  nm ( or 780 nm ) for the rubidium d1 ( d2 ) transition with a full - width - half - maximum ( fhwm ) bandwidth of 3  nm ( 0.5  nm ) .",
    "the single pulse energy was varied up to 0.03  mj , which was equivalent to a rabi pulse area of @xmath90 when the pulse diameter at the atom was about 0.5  mm and the size of the atom cloud was 200  @xmath91 m .",

    "the number of ions ( rb@xmath94 ) was counted by a micro - channel plate detector ( mcp ) .",
    "the signal linearity was assured by operating the experiment in the one - photon perturbation regime .",
    "the error due to three - photon ionizations by the pump pulse was estimated below 5% at a pulse - area of @xmath95  @xcite , which was negligible in the considered experimental condition .",
    "the whole experiment ( four steps : mot - turn off , laser - control , ionization , mot - turn on ) was repeated at 2 hz by cyclically turning on and off three mechanical shutters .",

    "the theoretical calculations are respectively plotted with dashed lines , of which the deviation from the experimental result is due to the spatially inhomogeneous laser interaction with the atom ensemble  @xcite . when the spatial averaging effect is taken into account ( by assuming the gaussian laser beam and atom ensemble size ratio is 2.5 ) ,",

    "electron spin polarization controls by photo - excitation of atoms have been theoretically discussed for alkali atoms  @xcite , where coherent excitations to @xmath128 states by circularly - polarized light was considered so that spin - orbit coupling exchanged spin and angular momenta .",
    "alternatively , it can be considered , based on our demonstration , that the excited @xmath128 state is independently controlled to @xmath129 and @xmath130 through ultrafast rabi oscillations .",

    "the second pulse resonantly tuned to @xmath130 state completely excites the remaining ground - state atoms , which are then photo - ionized by an extra means of an ultrafast time resolution .",
    "finally the third pulse identical to the first pulse de - excites the atoms in @xmath129 back to the ground state to complete the spin polarization control .",

    "higher fidelity controls may be achieved through adiabatic passages by applying frequency chirps .",
    "in summary , we have studied ultrafast - laser driven rabi oscillations of ms transformed atomic rubidium transitions .",
    "the complex coupling linkages involved with the d1 or d2 transitions are analyzed based on the ms transformation and the simplified decoupled systems are experimentally investigated by ultrafast laser interactions of spatially - localized rubidium atoms in a mot in the strong interaction regime . it has been found that all the system dynamics are governed by a sum of at most two decoupled rabi oscillations for any polarization state of the interacting ultrafast pulse .",
