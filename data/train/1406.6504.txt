    "in the last 20 years , great progress has been made in the study of a new branch of nuclear physics , i.e , the isospin nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that , within the parabolic approximation , the energy per particle in asymmetric nuclear matter can be approximately expressed as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the isospin asymmetry parameter and @xmath3 is the density - dependent nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the latter has been studied for decades due to its great importance in both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made , the symmetry energy is still subject to uncertainties especially at high - density region @xcite .",
    "nowadays , many sensitive observables have been identified as promising probes of the symmetry energy , such as the @xmath4 ratio @xcite , energetic photon as well as @xmath5 @xcite , the neutron to proton ratio @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , the isospin fractionation @xcite and the neutron - proton differential flow @xcite .",
    "however , one only knows these observables are in general sensitive to the high - density or low - density behaviors of the symmetry energy at certain beam energy whereas none knows the decomposition of sensitivity of the symmetry energy observables in the whole density region .",
    "such knowledge surely affects obtaining information of the density - dependent symmetry energy from comparisons of theoretical simulation and experimental data . in this study , based on the isospin - dependent transport model ,",
    "we address the above question .",
    "( color online ) evolution of the central baryon density in the reaction of @xmath8 at beam energies of 400 and 200 mev / nucleon with an impact parameter of b=1 fm .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the nuclear saturation density.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     ( color online ) evolution of the distribution percentage of baryon number in different density regions in the central reaction of @xmath8 at beam energies of 400 and 200 mev / nucleon , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this study , for simplicity , we use the isospin and density - dependent single particle potential @xmath9 where the isoscalar potential reads @xmath10 this soft nuclear isoscalar potential ( sbkd ) with @xmath11 = 200 mev , was firstly introduced by bertsch , kruse and das gupta @xcite . for the isovector potential @xmath12 , we use the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the reduced bayron density and @xmath15 = 1/2 ( -1/2 ) for neutrons ( protons ) .",
    "this symmetry potential roughly stands for one of the frequently used symmetry potential in nuclear transport models .",
    "to probe the density - dependent symmetry energy , it is instructive to know the time evolution of central maximal baryon density reached in heavy - ion collisions . figure  [ density ] shows the evolution of the central maximal baryon density reached in @xmath8 reaction at beam energies of 400 and 200 mev / nucleon with an impact parameter of b=1 fm .",
    "one can see that the central maximal baryon density reached is about 2.5@xmath16 for the incident beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon and about 2.0@xmath16 for 200 mev / nucleon case .",
    "and one can also see that the supra - density nuclear matter exists longer for 200 mev / nucleon case than that for 400 mev / nucleon case .    in order to better understand our target of studying the sensitivity of symmetry - energy - sensitive observables in different density regions ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ percentage ] , we plot the evolution of the distribution percentage of baryon number in different density regions .",
    "we can see that the distribution percentage of baryon number in different density regions changes with reaction time .",
    "more baryons lie in the density region around 1@xmath171.5@xmath16 in the whole reaction process . at the beginning of the reaction ( t @xmath18 1 fm / c ) nucleons in the two colliding nuclei",
    "are slightly compressed , thus more nucleons lie in the density region @xmath19 . immediately after this",
    ", the central density of the reaction increases rapidly due to compression as shown in figure  [ density ] .",
    "since baryons lie in different density regions , it is thus necessary to study in which density region the symmetry - energy - sensitive observables show maximal sensitivity . in order to know in which density region the frequently used symmetry energy",
    "sensitive observables show maximal sensitivity to the symmetry energy , similar with the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the whole density region ( @xmath20 ) we use the @xmath21 as the standard calculation , which gives a value of one observable @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 to see the relative sensitivity of this observable in different density regions ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , we turn off the symmetry energy in one density region but keep the symmetry energy in the residual density region .",
    "we thus get the other value of this observable @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 through comparing these new computational results with the standard calculation @xmath22 , one can obtain the relative sensitivity in a certain density region , which reads @xmath27 in the following , we demonstrate decomposition of the sensitivity of the frequently mentioned observables in the literature .     relative sensitivity ( @xmath28 ) of the symmetry - energy - sensitive observable @xmath4 as a function of density.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     relative sensitivity ( @xmath28 ) of the symmetry - energy - sensitive observable pre - equilibrium free n / p as a function of density.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath4 ratio was first proposed as a probe of nuclear symmetry energy in 2002 by _ li _ @xcite .",
    "it is generally considered to be sensitive to the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy . shown in figure  [ rpion400 ]",
    "is the decomposition of the sensitivity of the symmetry energy observable @xmath4 in different density regions . from figure  [ rpion400 ]",
    "we can clearly see that the maximal sensitivity of @xmath4 to the density - dependent symmetry energy lies in the density region around @xmath29 . above @xmath30 , sensitivity of @xmath4 to the symmetry energy",
    "is roughly equal to that below @xmath16 .",
    "with increase of density , collision effect becomes larger .",
    "thus one can see that the maximal sensitivity does not lie in the maximal density region reached .",
    "due to rescatterings of pion meson in the low - density region , charged pion ratio @xmath4 is also affected by the low - density behavior of the symmetry energy in some degree .",
    "in general , the sensitivity of charged pion ratio @xmath4 to the nuclear symmetry energy is larger in the high density region @xmath31 than that in low density region @xmath32 .    shown in figure  [ rnp400 ] is decomposition of the sensitivity of the symmetry energy observable pre - equilibrium free neutron to proton ratio",
    "n / p in different density regions . from figure  [ rnp400 ] , we can clearly see that the maximal sensitivity of the free neutron to proton ratio",
    "n / p at the incident beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon lies in the density region around @xmath30 .",
    "because nucleon emission at pre - equilibrium of the reaction does not suffer scatterings from the low - density matter , the symmetry energy in the low density region thus has minor effect .",
    "same as figure  [ rpion400 ] , but at the beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     same as figure  [ rnp400 ] , but at the beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is of interest to make similar study at incident beam energy below 400 mev / nucleon since such experiments of probing the symmetry energy and related are being planned or performed at riken in japan @xcite . shown in figure  [ rpion200 ] is decomposition of the sensitivity of the symmetry energy observable @xmath4 in different density regions in au+au reactions at the beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon .",
    "we can see that the maximal sensitivity of @xmath4 to the density - dependent symmetry energy lies also in the density region around @xmath29 . and",
    "it is in general still sensitive to the high density ( @xmath33 ) behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "more interestingly , we can see that the sensitivity of charged pion ratio @xmath4 to the symmetry energy is about two times larger than that at 400 mev / nucleon beam energy .",
    "therefore , one uses charged pion ratio @xmath4 to probe the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy , it is better to do experiments at relatively lower incident beam energy @xcite . as for the observable pre - equilibrium free neutron to proton ratio at incident beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon , it is shown in figure  [ rnp200 ] .",
    "the maximal sensitivity of the pre - equilibrium free neutron to proton ratio",
    "n / p at the incident beam energy of 200 mev / nucleon also lies in the density region around @xmath30 .",
    "in general , the symmetry energy in the low density region has minor effect .    as shown in figure  [ percentage ] , because only a small percentage of baryon lies in the maximum density region reached and also in the maximum density there are larger collision effects , symmetry - energy - sensitive observables are not sensitive to the symmetry energy in the maximal baryon - density region . to probe the symmetry energy at higher densities ,",
    "one thus needs heavy - ion collisions at even higher beam energy .",
    "however , the larger collision effects at higher beam energy increase the difficulty of studying nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "in summary , within the isospin dependent ibuu transport model , we studied the au+au reaction at incident beam energies of 200 and 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "it is found that the symmetry - energy - sensitive observables including charged pion ratio @xmath4 , pre - equilibrium free neutron - proton ratio @xmath6 mainly probe the density - dependent symmetry energy around 1.25@xmath0 ( for pion emission ) or 1.5@xmath0 ( for pre - equilibrium nucleon emission ) .",
    "effects of the symmetry energy in the low - density region is in general small but observable . since the symmetry - energy - sensitive observables are not sensitive to the symmetry energy in the maximal baryon - density region",
    ", it is therefore a challenge to probe the symmetry energy at higher densities .",
