    "complementary approaches aimed at distinguishing the nature of the progenitor systems include the search for the contribution to the early - time light curve from a possible companion @xcite , na i d line absorption features interpreted as evidence for circumstellar material @xcite , late - time bolometric light curves @xcite , gamma - ray emission @xcite , setting upper limits on the single degenerate scenario in old stellar populations from the lack of x - ray flux associated with the accretion @xcite , comparing predictions of sn  ia progenitor models with the properties of observed sn remnants @xcite , searching for the companion stars around young supernova remnants @xcite , or constraining the circumstellar medium and hence the evolutionary channel from radio observations @xcite .",
    "another approach aims at constraining the scenarios via rates and delay times , either by comparing prediction of binary population synthesis to observations @xcite or by inferring e.g. merger rates from the statistics of observed wd binary systems @xcite .    in this work , we determine and discuss the neutrino- and the gravitational wave signal of the n100 explosion model of @xcite .",
    "n100 is a recent , state - of - the - art , three - dimensional hydrodynamic explosion model of a delayed - detonation in a near chandrasekhar - mass ( @xmath4 ) carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "such delayed - detonation models are among the most promising candidates to explain a substantial fraction of the sn  ia  population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have chosen the n100 model for our study since its synthetic light curves and spectra make it a rather promising candidate for a `` normal '' sn  ia  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nucleosynthetic yields and electromagnetic emission of the n100 model have already been used as representative of near-@xmath4  delayed - detonations in the single degenerate scenario in several recent publications @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we actually re - calculate the n100 model from @xcite , this time also taking internal energy losses due to neutrino escape from all contributing source terms dynamically into account . for completeness",
    ", we therefore refer to this model hereafter as n100@xmath5 .",
    "the maximum central density of wds is @xmath6 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "neutrino trapping starts only at densities of @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xcite , wd matter is therefore always transparent to neutrinos ; in good approximation , they leave the star without any interaction .",
    "this simplifies the neutrino physics greatly , because we can assume that the energy that the neutrinos get when they are created is immediately lost to the star .",
    "nevertheless , in the hot ashes of burnt co matter , the thermodynamic conditions are such that copious amounts of neutrinos can be emitted .",
    "calculations of the neutrino signal for a few sn ia explosion models have been presented in the literature . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the neutrino signal for the w7 model @xcite , a one - dimensional fast deflagration of a @xmath9 co wd .",
    "@xcite calculated the neutrino signal for the n7d1r10t15c model @xcite , a two - dimensional pure deflagration of a @xmath10 co wd and the y12 model @xcite , a two - dimensional `` detonating - failed - deflagration '' ( gravitationally confined detonation ) model of the same 1.36 @xmath11  co wd .",
    "although @xcite refer to the y12 model as a delayed - detonation , this term is usually reserved for sne ia that undergo a deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) when the deflagration flame front reaches lower densities where it gets shredded by turbulence and the mixing of cold fuel and hot ash triggers a detonation @xcite .",
    "the explosion mechanism in the y12 model is fundamentally different in that the detonation is triggered not during the rising phase of the deflagration , but rather at a much later time when deflagration ashes that are gravitationally bound to the surface of the wd collide , see ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previously considered multi - dimensional sn ia models represent only peculiar events , i.e.  pure turbulent deflagration and gravitationally confined detonation models . here , we present neutrino luminosities for a three - dimensional delayed - detonation model of a @xmath12 co  wd that underwent a ddt .",
    "these explosion models have been extensively studied in the literature , and may be able to explain `` normal '' sne ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "see @xcite .",
    "we distinguish between _ weak _ neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions and _ thermal _ neutrinos produced by thermal plasma processes . in the following two sections , we introduce the physical processes that generate the neutrinos during thermonuclear burning in wds .",
    "_ weak neutrinos _",
    "are emitted in nuclear reactions involving the weak interaction ; the amount of emitted energy depends on specific reaction rates and therefore on the composition of the matter .",
    "the reaction rates themselves depend strongly on temperature and density .",
    "weak neutrinos and antineutrinos are produced in electron captures @xmath13 positron capture processes @xmath14 @xmath15 decays @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays @xmath18 all reactions , which can also occur inside nuclei , change the electron fraction @xmath19 ( defined as the number of electrons per baryon ) of the matter .",
    "neutrinos from electron captures ( [ eq : ecapture ] ) are abundantly produced in the neutronization processes that take place during and immediately after thermonuclear burning .",
    "as we will see , the energy released in reactions  ( [ eq : ecapture][eq : beta- ] ) dominates the energy released in all other neutrino generating processes in the physical environment of thermonuclear supernovae .",
    "in particular , electron capture reactions ( [ eq : ecapture ] ) play an important role during the thermonuclear burning of wd matter .",
    "they lead to neutronization , expressed as decreasing @xmath19 , lowering the electron degeneracy pressure and thereby affecting the dynamics of the fluid .",
    "electron captures on the constituent parts of co wds , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , would occur via the following reactions @xcite : @xmath22 the threshold energy for the first reaction chain is @xmath23 , for the second reaction chain @xmath24 .",
    "the fermi energies of the electrons match these values at densities of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively @xcite .    as mentioned above , central densities of accreting co wds",
    "are not expected to exceed @xmath27 @xcite , well below @xmath28 and @xmath29 , before thermonuclear burning starts in the central region .",
    "therefore , for densities appropriate for co wds , no electron captures on the most abundant unburnt nuclei occur .",
    "they are only possible after the start of thermonuclear burning , in particular on the hot `` ashes '' .    using the weak interaction rates of @xcite , @xcite calculated extensive tables of the time rate of change of the specific energy @xmath30 and the time rate of change of the electron fraction @xmath31 in these ashes for a three dimensional grid in density , temperature , and @xmath19 .",
    "we have extended their tables to determine the mean electron neutrino and electron antineutrino energies by implementing equation 17 of @xcite into the nuclear statistical equilibrium code of @xcite .",
    "we interpolate in the tables to determine the amount of energy carried away by weak neutrinos for each grid cell and simply subtract it from the internal energy of the cell in every time step .",
    "the mean neutrino energies are determined by post - processing the output of the hydrodynamics simulations , once again interpolating in the tables , utilizing the nse mass fraction , electron fraction , temperature , and density stored for each cell .      in the hot plasmas of stellar interiors",
    ", neutrinos are also emitted due to processes that are independent of nuclear reactions ; the amount of emitted energy depends only on the density and temperature of the matter .",
    "most important are neutrinos originating from electron - positron pair annihilation , photoemission , plasmon decay , bremsstrahlung , and recombination processes ( for a brief description and summary of the individual contributions of these processes see @xcite ) .",
    "neutrinos from these processes are often combined as _",
    "thermal neutrinos _ , they comprise neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors , whereas in reactions  ( [ eq : ecapture][eq : beta- ] ) only electron and anti - electron neutrinos are produced .",
    "we calculate the energy that is released from the wd due to the emission of _ thermal neutrinos _ using a code in which analytic fitting formulas from @xcite are implemented . in every time step",
    "we simply subtract the resulting locally calculated neutrino energies from the internal energy of each cell .",
    "the weak- and thermal neutrino luminosities for n100@xmath5 are shown as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the weak neutrino luminosity reaches a maximum of @xmath32 at @xmath33 and the integrated total weak neutrino energy loss amounts to @xmath34 .",
    "the weak neutrino luminosity is overwhelmingly dominated by electron neutrinos from electron captures and @xmath35 decay . in comparison ,",
    "the electron antineutrino luminosity from positron capture and @xmath36 decay is more than six orders of magnitude smaller ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) . at the time of maximum luminosity ,",
    "the mean weak electron neutrino energy is 4.0 mev and the mean weak electron antineutrino energy is 2.2 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "the thermal neutrino luminosity reaches a maximum of @xmath37 at @xmath38 and the integrated total thermal neutrino energy loss amounts to @xmath39 .",
    "the energy drained from the explosion by neutrinos is therefore small compared to e.g.  the nuclear energy released in the explosion , the initial gravitational binding energy , or the final kinetic energy .",
    "owing to the stochastic nature of our implementation of the deflagration - to - detonation transition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , even a small additional energy loss could , in principle , lead to very different final explosion .",
    "this is , however , not the case here as the time at which the first ddt occurs is only slightly delayed ( @xmath40 vs. @xmath41 ) . as a result",
    ", there is only a small reduction in kinetic energy between n100 ( @xmath42 ) and n100@xmath5 ( @xmath43 ) . although dynamically not very important , it is interesting to note that the energy carried away by neutrinos in @xmath44 is still on the same order of magnitude as the total energy radiated in photons by the sn during its entire duration .",
    "the secondary peak around @xmath45 in both the weak and thermal component of the neutrino signal is a signature of the deflagration - to - detonation transition .",
    "the secondary maximum occurs with a time delay with respect to @xmath46 since the increased neutrino emission occurs only when the detonation ( which was launched at low density ) overruns the highest density fuel in the center that was left unburned by the deflagration .",
    "@xcite also find a secondary maximum for the y12 model and call it a `` smoking gun '' of delayed - detonation sne .",
    "their secondary maximum , however , occurs with a relatively long time delay ( @xmath47 ) after the primary maximum .",
    "this difference of the occurrence time of the secondary maximum is a reflection of the fundamentally different mechanisms that lead to the initiation of the detonation in the y12 and n100@xmath5 models . for a similar reason ,",
    "these two models also differ by a factor of @xmath48 in their maximum neutrino luminosities , @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 . although both y12 and n100@xmath5 contain both a deflagration and a subsequent detonation , the fact that n100@xmath5 burns significantly more mass than y12 during the ( for neutrino emission dominant ) deflagration phase leads to the fact that the n100@xmath5 neutrino signal is more like that of pure deflagration models ( @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath52 @xcite ) , which , however , lack the characteristic secondary maximum of our simulations .     model as a function of time , originating from weak and thermal neutrinos , respectively . indicated",

    "research on gravitational wave signals of sne  ia  is a largely unexplored field .",

    "both @xcite and @xcite predicted there are about 500 galactic double degenerate sne  ia  progenitors that harbour the physical properties ( distance , mass , separation ) to enable their detection in gravitational waves .",
    "@xcite calculated the gravitational wave signal of a close binary system of two wds in the ringdown phase until the start of the merger , but they did not model the following thermonuclear burning which may lead to a supernova",
    ". pioneering work on the signal from an actual explosion has recently been performed by @xcite and @xcite , who calculated the gravitational wave signal of _ gravitationally - confined detonation ( gcd ) _ models of thermonuclear supernovae ( the y12 model discussed extensively in sec .",
    "[ sec : nu ] falls into this category ) . in these models ,",
    "an off - center ignited deflagration bubble rises due to buoyancy forces until it reaches the surface of the wd ; the deflagration does not unbind the star but triggers a subsequent detonation that ignites opposite to the point where the deflagration bubble reaches the surface .",
    "this scenario leads to asymmetric explosions and thus to relatively strong gravitational wave signals , which are discussed in detail in @xcite .    based on their earlier results",
    ", @xcite analyzed the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from thermonuclear supernovae arising from the gravitational confined detonation explosion mechanism .",
    "they found that it might pose a considerable source of noise  in the frequency range between @xmath59 and @xmath60  for future gravitational wave detectors such as decigo and bbo @xcite that are designed to detect the gravitational wave signal of cosmological inflation .",
    "our numerical approach for the computation of the gravitational wave signal follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculate only the approximate _ quadrupole radiation _ because of the newtonian nature of our simulations .    the most straightforward way to determine the amplitude of gravitational quadrupole waves is by calculating the second derivative of the quadrupole moment @xmath61 .",
    "the gravitational quadrupole radiation field in the transverse - traceless gauge @xmath62 is @xmath63 @xmath64 is the transverse - traceless projection operator @xmath65 with the normalized position vector @xmath66 and the distance to the source @xmath67 .",
    "however , the calculation of the second time derivative gives rise to numerical instabilities , the resulting signal is quite noisy . therefore , to avoid this unfavorable method , @xcite and @xcite introduced a different way to compute the amplitude",
    ". with this new method , which was applied successfully to core - collapse supernovae by @xcite and @xcite , the gravitational quadrupole radiation field @xmath62",
    "is calculated by @xmath68    here @xmath69 is the velocity and @xmath70 is the usual newtonian gravitational potential or an effective relativistic gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite showed that equation  ( [ eq : htt ] ) is equivalent to equation  ( [ eq : htt_quad ] ) , while @xcite demonstrated the numerical superiority of the method that implements equation  ( [ eq : htt ] ) .",
    "since gravitational waves have two polarization states ( `` + '' and `` @xmath71 '' ) , the amplitude can be written in terms of the two _ unit linear - polarization tensors _ @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite as @xmath74 in the case of a plane wave propagating in @xmath75-direction , the unit linear - polarization tensors are @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the unit vectors parallel to the @xmath79- and @xmath80-axis , respectively .",
    "we calculate the amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 considering two different lines of sight , as was suggested in @xcite .",
    "since they use preferentially spherical coordinates , they speak of the polar ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) and equatorial ( @xmath85 ,  @xmath84 ) direction . in our case , as we use exclusively cartesian coordinates , it is more appropriate to call it the @xmath75-direction and @xmath79-direction , which we do from now on . with the definition @xmath86 the amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the @xmath75-direction can be expressed as @xmath87 while in the @xmath79-direction one obtains @xmath88 we implemented the calculation of these amplitudes according to equation  ( [ eq : idotdot ] ) in the simulation code .",
    "next we show results of the calculated gravitational wave signal , beginning with a discussion of the four amplitudes ( [ eq : apluspol][eq : akreuzeq ] ) .      , see text for details . indicated are the time of the first deflagration - to - detonation transition @xmath53 and the time @xmath54 when the detonation wave reaches the center of the wd . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr14 ] we plot four different gravitational wave amplitudes that arise from two different lines of sight ( @xmath79- and @xmath75-direction ) , each with two polarization states ( @xmath71 and @xmath89 ) , see sec .",
    "[ sec : code_gw ] for a detailed explanation . in the first @xmath90 after the ignition of the deflagration ,",
    "no signal is visible ; after that the absolute values of all amplitudes rise in a steady , monotonic way .",
    "the initiation of the first detonation at @xmath91 and the time @xmath92 when the detonation reaches the center of the wd leave visible imprints on the signal . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the signal reaches a maximum value of @xmath94 at @xmath95 , about a factor of @xmath96 less than the maximum amplitude obtained by @xcite in their gcd model .",
    "the smaller maximum amplitude of the n100@xmath5 delayed - detonation model is naturally explained by the greater compactness of the gcd model when the detonation is triggered .",
    "the homologous expansion of the supernova ejecta after @xmath97 generates a signal that is constant in time up to @xmath98 , when the simulation was stopped .      .",
    "indicated are the time of the first deflagration - to - detonation transition @xmath53 and the time @xmath54 when the detonation wave reaches the center of the wd . ]    . ]    beyond the amplitudes , another quantity of interest is the total amount of energy radiated away by gravitational waves , @xmath99 .",
    "it can be expressed as @xcite @xmath100 all values of @xmath99 stated in this work are calculated by means of equation  ( [ eq : egw ] ) .",
    "the total gravitational wave energy of n100@xmath5 amounts to @xmath101 , about an order of magnitude less than the total energy of the gcd model of @xcite  this is again consistent with the results shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : ia_gwamp ] , because the calculated amplitudes differ by a factor of @xmath102 and the energy is proportional to the square of the amplitudes .",
    "these results demonstrate that the gravitational wave energy is dynamically unimportant since it is smaller than the internal- , kinetic- , nuclear- , and even neutrino loss energies .",
    "hence , the error caused by the fact that we did not couple the gravitational waves part of the code to the hydrodynamics part is negligible .",
    "the gravitational wave luminosity as a function of time is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : gwlum ] . clearly visible",
    "is a two - peaked structure ; the first peak corresponds to the deflagration phase and features a maximum luminosity of @xmath103 at @xmath104 , while the second , considerably higher peak can be attributed to the detonation phase , peaking at the time @xmath92 when the detonation reaches the center of the wd and converts the last remaining high density fuel to iron group elements .",
    "here the maximum luminosity is @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast , the gcd model of @xcite predicts a much greater difference in maximum power radiated in the deflagration and detonation phases .",
    "this difference is due to the more weakly ignited deflagration , which leads to a smaller degree of expansion and correspondingly a detonation in a more compact wd .",
    "the _ frequency _ @xmath106 of a gravitational wave signal is an important quantity to determine , because detectors are only sensitive in a confined frequency range ; see @xcite for a discussion on quantifying gravitational wave source amplitude and sensitivity curves .",
    "we adopt the approach of @xcite and @xcite and conduct fourier analyses of the calculated gravitational wave amplitudes and determine the energy spectrum @xmath107 .",
    "the fourier transforms of the @xmath108 are @xmath109 following @xcite , we obtain the energy spectrum by @xmath110    fig .  [",
    "fig : dr23b ] shows the energy spectrum of the gravitational wave signal , calculated by means of equation  ( [ eq : gw_dedf ] ) by evaluating the fourier integrals ( [ eq : fourier ] ) .",
    "the spectrum has a pronounced maximum of @xmath111 at @xmath112 and a secondary local maximum of @xmath113 at @xmath114 .",
    "the energy spectrum calculated by @xcite for the gcd model peaked at @xmath115 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite stated that an explosion model with more `` pre - expansion '' prior to detonation , such as the n100@xmath5 model presented here , would exhibit a characteristic gravitational wave frequency shifted downward by a factor of @xmath116 , a prediction that we essentially confirm .",
    "our results show that the detection of gravitational wave signals of sne  ia provides a way to differentiate between different explosion models with future gravitational wave observatories , if data analysis techniques are developed to extract those signals . the signal of our explosion model bears the mark of the deflagration - to - detonation transition .",
    "gravitational waves generated by mergers of two wds would feature the characteristic signature of the ringdown phase  according to @xcite ,",
    "the gravitational wave signal in the ringdown phase is of the same magnitude as the signal of the supernova in the above discussed scenarios : @xmath117 to @xmath118 , depending on the wd masses .",
    "finally , gcd models show a sharp single peak in the time evolution of the amplitude ( figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the low frequency range of the signals prevents a detection by second - generation instruments comparable to advanced ligo ; but third - generation space - based detectors like bbo or decigo that cover a lower frequency range should be able to detect the gravitational wave signal of at least all galactic type  ia supernovae .",
    "the gravitational wave frequencies that we obtain are consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results show that also thermonuclear supernovae modeled as delayed detonations contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background in the frequency range between @xmath59 and @xmath60 and thus pose a source of noise that might obscure the gravitational wave signal originating from the era of inflation shortly after the big bang ; the measurement of this signal is a central goal of the planned detectors bbo and decigo .",
    "finally , we estimate the detectability of our n100@xmath119 delayed - detonation model . depending on viewing angle and polarization ,",
    "our gravitational wave amplitudes fall in the range between approximately 1 to @xmath120 ( see fig .  [",

    "both bbo and decigo have a planned strain sensitivity limit of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath123 we find that our model s signal would be detectable out to a distance of 320 kpc and 1.3 mpc for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "thus , a delayed - detonation sn  ia going off in our milky way or one of its satellite galaxies would be well within the sensitivity limits of bbo or decigo . for fortuitous alignment ( i.e.  @xmath125 ) , even the triangulum and andromeda galaxies ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively ) would be within reach .",
    "we conducted a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a delayed - detonation explosion of a thermonuclear supernova and computed the neutrino and gravitational wave signals . by taking the energetics of neutrino losses on the hydrodynamic evolution into account",
