    "<S> the pion source as seen through hbt correlations at rhic energies is investigated within the urqmd approach . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the calculated transverse momentum , centrality , and system size dependence of the pratt - hbt radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 are reasonably well in line with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted @xmath2 values in central heavy ion collisions are larger as compared to experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding quantity @xmath3 of the pion emission source is somewhat larger than experimental estimates .    in the quest to discover the high temperature phase of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , the beam energies of accelerators have been boosted upwards from sis , ags , sps , to rhic . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that the phase transition from hadrons to quarks might only occur in a small volume part of the system and within a rather short timespan in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the qgp drops formed at rhic might be represented only by a few , locally thermally equilibrated drops of matter , in which quarks and gluons are de - confined . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is essential to probe the space - time structure of the ( equilibrated ? ) source  the `` region of homogeneity '' . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the small size and transient nature of the reactions preclude direct measurement of the time and/or position . </S>",
    "<S> instead , correlations of two final - state particles at small relative momenta provide the most direct link to the size and lifetime of subatomic reactions . </S>",
    "<S> a well - established technique , the so - called `` femtoscopy '' or `` hbt '' in the heavy - ion community ( in reference to hanbury - brown and twiss s original work with photons ) has been extensively used for hics with energies from sis , ags , sps , to rhic @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous hbt - measurements with various two - particle species have been pursued ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . identically charged pion interferometry has been most extensively investigated . </S>",
    "<S> basic , but important systematics of femtoscopic measurements from the ags , sps , and rhic have been discovered @xcite , such as the dependence of the hbt radii on system size , collision centrality , rapidity , transverse momentum , and particle mass . however , the existence of the so - called hbt - puzzle ( i.e. , the fact that model calculations that incorporate a phase transition to a new state of matter with many degrees of freedom significantly over - predict the observed source sizes ) @xcite drives us to a deeper and more systematical theoretical exploration . </S>",
    "<S> the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd , v2.2 ) transport model ( employing hadronic and string degrees of freedom ) ( for details , the reader is referred to refs.@xcite ) and the analyzing program crab ( v3.0@xmath4 ) @xcite are employed here as tools to analyze the two - particle interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the probable qgp phase is not strictly treated in the present version of urqmd model for the early - stage hics . </S>",
    "<S> however , the failure of fluid dynamical models to get the @xmath5-dependence of the hbt radii @xcite suggests that flow is not the only aspect that influences the observed @xmath5-dependence of hbt radii . a realistic hadronic cascade model such as urqmd </S>",
    "<S> can thus throw light on what other mechanisms during the late freeze - out stage induce strong coordinate - momentum correlations and thereby generate the observed strong @xmath5-dependence of the hbt radii . with this equipment , </S>",
    "<S> the excitation functions of the hbt radii of negatively charged pions are calculated systematically . in this paper , we focus on rhic energies , where the biggest challenge is faced by the current theoretical models . the femtoscopy results at lower energies will be presented in a further study @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function of two particles is decomposed in pratt s ( so - called longitudinal co - moving system `` out - side - long '' ) three - dimensional convention ( pratt - radii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional correlation function is fit with the standard gaussian form :    @xmath6    in which @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the components of the pair momentum difference @xmath9 and the homogeneity length ( pratt - radii ) in the @xmath10 direction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 is the incoherence factor , which lies between 0 ( complete coherence ) and 1 ( complete incoherence ) in realistic hics . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 represents the cross - term . for mass - symmetric colliding system </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath12 vanishes automatically at mid - rapidity due to the longitudinal reflection symmetry and is also found to be negligible in our present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the present urqmd calculations at rhic energies , the coulomb and other potential interactions are not considered ( the `` cascade mode '' is used ) due to the excessive computing times which would have been used otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb final state interactions are not taken into account in the analyzing program crab .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] gives the transverse momentum @xmath5 dependence ( @xmath13 ) of the pratt - radii @xmath0 ( left plots ) , @xmath2 ( middle plots ) , and @xmath1 ( right plots ) at nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energies @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 gev ( plots from top to bottom ) in au+au reactions . the experimental results at energies @xmath18 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 gev for central collisions ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 of the total cross section @xmath22 , respectively ) and at mid - rapidities ( @xmath23 ) are taken from refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental error bars are shown as the sum of both statistical and systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding calculations with the same trigger- and acceptance- conditions as in the experiments are shown , as well as the lower energy case @xmath14 gev for central collisions ( @xmath19 of @xmath22 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> both the absolute values and the decrease of the pratt - radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 with transverse momentum is reproduced by the present model calculations very well . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the decrease of the pratt - radii with the increase of transverse momentum is still under discussion : it may be caused by the strong underlying transverse flow @xcite , or , by the temperature inhomogeneities within the hadron source ( point of view of the hydrodynamics model ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , it is also seen that the calculated @xmath5-dependence of @xmath1 is somewhat flatter than that of @xmath0 , which implies that flow effects on the @xmath5-dependence of the pratt - radii can at least not be excluded . </S>",
    "<S> besides the flow effect , the surface - like emission charactistic of microscopic models should play significantly ( or even dominant ) role on hbt parameters as well because also other cascade / boltzmann calculations ( see e.g. , the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( rqmd ) @xcite , the hadronic rescattering model ( hrm ) @xcite , and a multi - phase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite ) can reproduce the @xmath5 dependence of pratt radii ( almost ) equally well . </S>",
    "<S> the transport of the hadronic gas , or the final state hadronic corona dynamics , should be further investigated since the qgp image is obscured by the hadronic corona @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the urqmd calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 reproduce the experimental data well within the error bars , while the calculated @xmath2 s are larger than the experimental data  the @xmath2 is about @xmath24 too large . </S>",
    "<S> we must conclude that at rhic , larger ratios of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are seen from hadron transport model than expected . </S>",
    "<S> similar observations have also been reported from most of other model calculations ( c.f . </S>",

    "<S> it was found that only @xmath33 of the observed elliptic flow is produced @xcite , which is probably due to a smaller anisotropy in the pressure gradients in the early stage of rhic collisions in the urqmd simulations compared to hydrodynamics . </S>",
