    "the strong usp conjecture is situated in the context of a broader family of conjectures from @xcite , which are all potential means to prove @xmath13 .",

    "the approach of @xcite shows that when @xmath15 is abelian , any stpp construction implies the inequality @xmath16 if the sets involved are large enough , this yields a nontrivial bound on @xmath0 , and @xcite showed how a family of sufficiently large stpp constructions would imply @xmath1 .",
    "this paper contains two main results .",
    "the first is a bound on the size of tricolored sum - free sets in abelian groups of bounded exponent .",
    "a tricolored sum - free set is a generalization of a three - term progression - free set ( a set whose elements satisfy @xmath17 ) in which the elements @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 range over three _ different _ subsets ( see definition  [ def : tri - sum - free ] ) .",

    "( this asymptotic formula for @xmath20 is a variant of the prime number theorem .",

    "these theorems extend the ellenberg ",
    "gijswijt  @xcite result in two directions : from progression - free sets to tricolored sum - free sets . ] and from abelian groups of prime exponent to abelian groups of bounded exponent .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ thm : boundedexponent ] disproves the strong usp conjecture via @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath15 has prime exponent @xmath30 , the bound in theorem  [ thm : zqn ] of @xmath31 agrees with the bound for progression - free sets obtained in  @xcite , but with a slightly worse exponent as we have stated it uniformly in @xmath30 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether @xmath32 can be improved to @xmath33 for general abelian groups of bounded exponent .",
    "a generalization of the ellenberg ",
    "gijswijt result that handles progression - free sets in abelian @xmath30-groups of bounded exponent was also obtained by petrov in  @xcite .    in the proof of theorem  [ thm : boundedexponent ] , we study a variant of tensor rank due to tao @xcite , which we call slice rank , and we show how slice rank is related to a quantitative version of the notion of instability from geometric invariant theory .",
    "we show that functions with low slice rank are unstable , and conversely prove that a quantitative bound on instability yields a bound on slice rank of tensor powers ( see section  [ sec : instability ] ) .",
    "our second main result generalizes @xcite by showing that every stpp construction yields a large tricolored sum - free set .",
    "together these two facts show that it is impossible to prove @xmath1 using sets satisfying the simultaneous triple product property in abelian groups of bounded exponent :    b [ thm : nosttp ] for every @xmath34 , there is an @xmath35 such that no stpp construction in any abelian group of exponent at most @xmath36 is large enough to yield a bound better than @xmath37 via the inequality  .",
    "note that all of the current best bounds on @xmath0 via the group - theoretic approach ( in @xcite ) , as well as the current best bounds on @xmath0 which use the coppersmith ",
    "winograd approach @xcite , yield stpp constructions whose underlying group is @xmath38 for @xmath18 fixed .    however , our results _ do not _ rule out achieving @xmath1 by using stpp constructions over abelian groups . specifically ,",
    "when the group has a large cyclic factor , it indeed contains a large sum - free subset and thus the constraints analyzed here are irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , one can use non - abelian groups or even more general objects such as association schemes @xcite .",
    "thus , our results serve to focus the search for group - theoretic constructions , and certainly do _ not _ rule them out as an approach to achieving @xmath1 .",
    "recall that the _ exponent of matrix multiplication _ is defined as @xmath39 in 2003 , cohn and umans  @xcite described a framework for proving upper bounds on @xmath0 by reducing matrix multiplication to group algebra multiplication .",
    "this reduction is carried out by means of a triple of subsets satisfying the _ triple product property _ :    subsets @xmath40 of a group @xmath41 satisfy the _ triple product property _ if @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "such a triple of subsets realizes @xmath49 inside the group algebra of @xmath41 .",
    "( here @xmath50 denotes the matrix multiplication tensor for multiplying an @xmath51 matrix by an @xmath52 matrix . ) from this , letting @xmath53 be the character degrees of @xmath41 ( i.e. , the dimensions of its irreducible representations ) , we obtain the inequality @xmath54 by bounding the rank of group algebra multiplication ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 ) .",
    "this inequality yields an upper bound for @xmath0 when @xmath41 and @xmath40 are chosen appropriately .    in the later paper @xcite several concrete routes to proving @xmath55 were proposed .",
    "these proposals seemingly go beyond the framework of the triple product property in various different ways ; however as described in @xcite , all of these constructions can be uniformly described using the triple product property as follows .",
    "several independent matrix multiplications are realized via the triple product property in the group algebra of a wreath product @xmath56 using certain well - chosen subsets of a group @xmath15 .",
    "this general formulation is captured by the simultaneous triple product property :    [ def : stpp ] an _ stpp construction _ is a collection of triples of subsets @xmath57 of a group @xmath15 satisfying the _ simultaneous triple product property _ ( stpp ) , which states that    1 .   for each @xmath58 the sets @xmath59 satisfy the triple product property , and 2 .   setting @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath67 satisfy the stpp if for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , we have @xmath75    an stpp construction in @xmath15 realizes the tensor @xmath76 and , via the asymptotic sum inequality  @xcite or the use of a wreath product @xcite , yields the fundamental inequality @xmath77 where @xmath53 are the character degrees of @xmath15 . for the rest of this paper we will take @xmath15 to be abelian ( with additive notation ) ,",
    "in which case this bound becomes the inequality of the introduction : @xmath78 all of the analysis of stpp constructions in the framework of @xcite is based on this inequality .",
    "no single stpp construction can achieve @xmath1 via ( more generally , see @xcite ) , so we must consider families of constructions in groups of growing size . to simplify the notation we typically do not index such families explicitly ( i.e. , we refer to a group @xmath15 rather than , say , @xmath79 ) .",
    "any stpp construction satisfies some simple `` packing bound '' inequalities , which reflect the fact that the sets @xmath80 must be disjoint from each other , as must @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this disjointness follows immediately from the second condition in the definition of the simultaneous triple product property .",
    "furthermore , since the sets @xmath59 satisfy the triple product property we must have @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . together",
    "these give the packing bounds : @xmath86    we say that a family of stpp constructions with @xmath87 _ meets the packing bound _ if @xmath88    a key observation is that meeting the packing bound is necessary for achieving @xmath1 :    [ lemma : packing ] any family of stpp constructions that does _ not _ meet the packing bound can not imply @xmath1 via the inequality .    in our usual notation , if @xmath89 for some fixed @xmath90 , then @xmath91 and so the strongest bound that can be obtained from is @xmath92 , which is bounded strictly away from the hoped - for @xmath1 .",
    "the same holds if either @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "both the strong usp conjecture  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  3.4 ) and the `` two families '' conjecture  ( * ? ? ? * conjecture  4.7 ) would , if true , yield stpp constructions that meet the packing bound and moreover prove @xmath13",
    ". however , the stpp constructions produced by the strong usp conjecture have underlying group @xmath95 , while the groups in the two families conjecture need not have bounded exponent .",
    "thus although theorem  [ thm : nosttp ] disproves the strong usp conjecture , it addresses only very special cases of the two families conjecture .",

    "given @xmath102 there exist unique @xmath103 and @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , and similarly for the other factors .",

    "then @xmath112 is a tricolored sum - free set .",
