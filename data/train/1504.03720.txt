    "astronomical transients represent huge releases of energy , often on very short timescales , and their discovery and follow - up allows us to probe the extreme physics involved .",
    "x - rays , being associated in large part with compact , high energy density processes such as accretion , can reveal much of the astrophysics in such events .",
    "the brightest x - ray sources in the sky are associated with accreting neutron stars and black holes and the vast majority are highly variable .    transients which can be detected as variable within individual  observations would be variable on timescales of seconds up to tens of kiloseconds for the longest observations . within our galaxy",
    "the major populations of x - ray transients exhibiting bursting behaviour on time - scales of seconds to hours come from flare stars and x - ray binary systems .",
    "flare stars can produce x - ray bursts on time - scales of minutes to hours due to magnetic reconnection events in the stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "accretion events in the bulk of x - ray binaries can show variability on these timescales , but in general with no more than @xmath11% amplitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "type 1 x - ray bursts are observed in neutron star x - ray binaries and are caused by thermonuclear flashes from accreted material on the neutron star surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these occur on time - scales of a few to hundreds of seconds releasing total energy of around @xmath12 ergs . supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) are high mass x - ray binary systems with supergiant companions .",
    "sfxts can produce x - ray flares on typical time - scales of 100 - 10,000 s @xcite .",
    "extragalactic populations of x - ray transients such as x - ray rich gamma - ray bursts and x - ray flashes @xcite can produce rapid bursts of x - rays with a wide range of peak energies .",
    "typically tidal disruption events evolve over too long a timescale ( months to years , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be detected as variable over a single  observation but the time - scale of the event decreases with black hole mass , radius of the disrupted star and the impact factor ( beta ) ( e.g. equation 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests the possibility of faster x - ray transients from the tidal disruption of compact stars around intermediate mass black holes ( e.g. in the case of white dwarfs see * ? ? ?",
    "there have recently been two discoveries of  transients on time - scales of hundreds of seconds with probable extragalactic origin .",
    "@xcite report a transient close to m86 with possible precursor events and a peak luminosity @xmath13 ( assuming the distance of m86 ) .",

    "@xcite report a transient in the chandra deep field - south survey of duration @xmath14 ks possibly associated with a r=27.38 ( ab ) galaxy with photometric redshift @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of two faint x - ray transients in archival  data .",
    "the analysis is split into two parts covering each transient discovered in turn .",
    "follow up near - infrared and archival very large array ( vla ) , two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and united states naval observatory ( usno - b ) observations of the field are analysed in a search for possible counterparts .",
    "we also analyse the spectral evolution of the transient discovered by @xcite , xrt  000519 .",
    "we then discuss the probable nature of these transients including the possibility that one is of similar nature to those discovered recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have searched the chandra data archive for rapid transient events , making use of the chandra source catalog @xcite and conducting our own search of data publicly released from 2010 onwards ( glennie et al . in preparation ) .",
    "there is a rich sample of statistically variable sources in the chandra data archive .",
    "we present two of the more unique transient sources discovered , which appear to be relatively bright and evolve over a short timescale .",
    "the first was discovered in an observation of the galaxy cluster aco 3581 with observation identification number ( obsid ) 12884 which began on 2011 january 3 .",
    "we name this transient after the date of the event , xrt  110103 .",
    "the observation in which the second transient was discovered was targeting the galaxy cluster spt - clj2352 - 4657 with obsid 13506 beginning 2012 august 30 .",

    "the details of the  observations and source coordinates are listed in table [ obs ] .",
    "all errors given are to the @xmath16 level of significance unless otherwise stated .",
    "the  data processing was done using ciao 4.5 and caldb 4.5.6 .",
    "the source positions were derived using the ciao tool wavdetect .",
    "source photons for each transient were extracted from a circular region centred on the wavdetect position with radii of 30 .",
    "this relatively large extraction region is warranted by the large off - axis angle of the transients of 13.3 and 12.3 arcmin for xrt  110103 and xrt  120830 respectively . in each case using an annulus as the background region would extend beyond the edge of the acis ccd so a nearby region of radius 60was chosen , centred on ra & dec @xmath17 for xrt  110103 and @xmath18 for xrt  120830 .",
    "the tool specextract was used to extract the source spectra and xspec 12.8.0 used for spectral fitting . in each case",
    "source photons in the range 0.3 - 7.0 kev were used for spectral analysis and the cash statistics @xcite used to determine the best - fit model parameters .    follow up near - infrared observations with the sirius instrument at the infrared survey facility ( irsf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were analysed using starlink gaia 4.4.4 .",
    "archival vla data of the field were reduced using the vla calibration pipeline 1.2.0 and imaging and analysis performed with casa 4.1.0 .",
    ".details of the observations and coordinates for each transient .",
    "the source position uncertainties are estimated using the method set out in @xcite including the champ positional uncertainty relations @xcite and the astrometric error calculated by @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ irsf_mag ]    we have fitted a powerlaw model ( pegpwrlw in xspec ) to the x - ray spectrum of xrt  120830 .",
    "as the proper motion of the possible counterpart suggests this is a nearby source we apply no correction for absorption . due to the low count rate we have taken source photons from the start of the burst to the end of the observation to get as many counts as possible .",
    "we find a photon index of @xmath19 and a peak flux of @xmath20 .",
    "we do not find a sufficient count rate to follow the spectral evolution of the source with a hardness ratio .",
    "without a counterpart and a subsequent redshift measurement it is not clear whether xrt  110103 is at the distance of the galaxy cluster aco 3581 or originates from a foreground or even more distant object . if it is associated with the cluster aco 3581 that would place it at a distance of 94.9 mpc @xcite , impying a peak luminosity of @xmath21 . the galactic latitude of xrt  110103 is @xmath22 suggesting a possible galactic source is unlikely to be further than @xmath14 kpc .",
    "at this distance , the peak luminosity would be @xmath23 which suggests an x - ray burst is unlikely @xcite .",
    "xrt  110103 exhibits similar properties to the transient xrt  000519 reported by @xcite . both evolve over a similar time - scale with the main burst taking place over a few hundred seconds and a slow powerlaw decay over the remainder of each observation .",
    "the lightcurve of xrt  000519 showed a twin peak in the main flare which is not evident in xrt  110103 .",
    "both have similar powerlaw spectra and were detected in observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "however , we are unable to associate xrt  110103 with any known counterpart within the cluster aco 3581 .",
    "xrt  000519 displayed precursor events @xmath24 and @xmath25 ks before the main flare . in the 6 ks of observations",
    "prior to the main flare of xrt  110103 we find no precursor events .",
    "xrt  110103 is a factor of a few fainter in flux so we can not rule out the possibility that similar precursor events are present but below our detection threshold .",
    "jonker et al .",
    "( 2013 ) offer multiple explanations for xrt  000519 , favouring the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "they do not rule out alternative scenarios such as the accretion of an asteroid by a foreground neutron star or an off - axis @xmath26-ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "@xcite estimate a peak luminosity for xrt  000519 of @xmath13 assuming a transient distance of 16.2 mpc , equivalent to that of m86 .",
    "if these events are due to the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole the different peak luminosities could be due to different black hole masses or due to different beaming factors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the transient recently discovered in the chandra deep field - south survey @xcite could also be related to xrt  110103 and xrt  000519 .",
    "the count rate quoted by @xcite and redshift for a potential counterpart galaxy of 0.31 @xcite suggest a peak luminosity of @xmath27 .",
    "these events could also be interpreted as x - ray flashes , which are probably related to grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the time - scale of the main flares and the late - time powerlaw decays seen in xrt  110103 and xrt  000519 are consistent with the early x - ray emission typically seen in grb lightcurves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure 7 in @xcite shows the peak energy constraints on x - ray flashes , x - ray - rich grbs and hard grbs . of these scenarios , the upper limits on the peak energy of xrt  110103 and xrt  000519 from the power law",
    "fits could only be consistent with an x - ray flash .",
    "however , for xrt  000519 the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) detected no gamma - ray burst at the time of the x - ray transient @xcite .    if xrt  110103 and xrt  000519 are the same type of object we provide an estimate of the rates for these events .",
    "we searched a total of 8.4 years of acis - i and acis - s public data with no grating used and found two events of this type . assuming an approximate 16 @xmath28 16 arc - minute field of view we derive a rate of @xmath4 per year over the whole sky with a peak x - ray flux greater than @xmath29 .",
    "there are significant biases in the sky sampling from  observations .",
    "if these transients are extragalactic then x - ray absorption in any galactic plane observations would likely result in any such transients being obscured .",
    "further if these events are associated with galaxy clusters then the  observations devoted to clusters ( approximately 18.5 per cent of acis observations are listed in this science category ) would have a greater chance of observing such an event than a random location on the sky . without firm knowledge of the nature or distance of these transients",
    "it is difficult to account for these possible biases .",
    "this combined with the small sample size suggests this rate should be treated as a very rough approximation .",
    "as we have two similar transients with such a large flux there should be many more fainter transients of a similar nature in the  archive .",
    "there should also be events in the archives of other soft x - ray telescopes such as _ rosat_. assuming a lightcurve and model similar to the best fit we find for xrt  110103 and a log - n log - s slope of -1.5 we calculate that there should be as many as 100 such events in the rosat all sky survey with greater than 15 photons detected .",
    "@xcite may have found some of these events .",
    "xrt  120830 has a galactic latitude of @xmath30 which suggests a galactic source would be within @xmath14 kpc . at this distance",
    "we find a peak luminosity of @xmath31 which again makes an x - ray burst unlikely .    the proper motion of @xmath9 milliarcsec per year for the likely counterpart to xrt  120830 suggests a flare from a nearby dwarf star as the most likely explanation for the x - ray transient .",
    "if we assume a typical tangential velocity for a local dwarf star of @xmath32 km s^-1^ ( e.g. see figure 7 of @xcite ) we find a distance of @xmath33 pc .",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath34 at such a distance would imply a dwarf star around the l1 spectral type ( see equation 6 and figure 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "the infrared colours are also consistent with a late m or early l dwarf ( e.g. figure 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that this is plausible distance .",
    "at this distance we estimate a peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath35 .",
    "larger peak x - ray luminosities have been reported in superflares for earlier type m dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this may be the largest x - ray flare detected in such a late type dwarf , although the distance and spectral type are uncertain .",
    "spectroscopic followup is required to confirm both the spectral type and provide a more accurate distance estimate .",
    "the marginal flaring events 7 and 14 ks after the main flare could be related to the rotation period of the dwarf star in this case , although we can not draw any firm conclusions regarding periodicity from 3 events .",
    "a @xmath36 hour rotation period would be rapid for an m dwarf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but some late - type dwarfs have comparable periods such as bri 0021 - 0214 at @xmath37 hours @xcite and 2massw j1707183 + 643933 at 3.6 hours which has also displayed a strong flare with an amplitude in the uv of at least 6 mag @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have discovered two previously unknown transients in archival  data .",
    "one of these events , xrt  110103 , could be extra - galactic in nature and deeper optical follow - up of xrt  110103 should help to determine the nature of this transient . combined with xrt  000519 and the transient reported by @xcite",
    "there is a population of  transients which could be of similar nature . a wider sample of such objects , from the  archive or other soft x - ray telescopes ,",
    "should help to determine whether these events are related to a known class of transient .",
    "xrt  120830 appears to be consistent with an x - ray flare from a late m or early l dwarf star .",
    "we are unable to confirm the precise spectral type of the dwarf from the infrared colours and magnitudes .",
    "the possible minor flares @xmath38 and @xmath39 ks after the main flare could be related to the rotation period of the star .    whilst telescopes with a large field of view such as _ swift - bat",
    "_ are ideal for detecting large numbers of transients those discovered serendipitously during routine observations can provide unique information .",
    "soft x - ray lightcurves and spectra are available for the entire transient event in this case rather than being limited to the afterglow . in the case of xrt  000519 the availability of a lightcurve prior to the main flare revealed possible precursor events",
    ". however , discovery years after the event means followup observations are likely to miss the decay phase of most transients .",
    "some form of quick alert system could rectify this , even if only alerting the principal investigator of the observation if data exclusivity periods must be adhered to .",
