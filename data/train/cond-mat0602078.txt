    "quantum brownian motion is much more involved than its classical analog since in general tractable equations of motion do not exist @xcite .",
    "progress can be made in two limiting ranges , namely , in the realm of weak dissipation and in the opposite one of strong friction . in the former case",
    "a perturbative treatment has led to a variety of markovian weak - coupling master equations @xcite , among them the famous lindblad @xcite and the redfield @xcite equations .",
    "successful applications include quantum optical systems , decoherence for solid - state based quantum bits and nonadiabatic dynamics in molecular systems , to name but a few .",
    "strong friction has been explored only recently @xcite with a growing amount of research since then @xcite . there , the quantum smoluchowski equation , a sort of markovian master equation as well , allows to investigate condensed phase dynamics at lower temperatures e.g.  in soft matter and mesoscopic systems @xcite .    a formally exact description of open quantum systems valid for all temperatures and damping strengths is provided by the path integral approach initiated by the work of feynman and vernon @xcite and developed in detail in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "the approach has been utilized in numerous applications especially in condensed phase systems , e.g.  to reveal the non - exponential decay of low temperature correlation functions , and has further been exploited to consistently derive the markovian master equations mentioned above @xcite .",
    "a real challenge , however , has been to evaluate the formally exact expression for the reduced density matrix in parameter regions where analytical progress and perturbative simplifications are prohibitive . with the increasing complexity of designed and controllable quantum systems on the nanoscale ,",
    "e.g.  for quantum information processing or molecular electronics , the issue of efficient numerical procedures in the _ real - time domain _ becomes a very crucial one .",
    "indeed , important achievements have been made in the last decade with the development of advanced path integral monte - carlo methods ( pimc ) @xcite , the quasi - adiabatic propagator scheme ( quapi ) @xcite , stochastic schrdinger equations @xcite , and basis set - methods @xcite .    in this context",
    "a certain class of systems has been extensively studied , namely , systems with discrete configuration space , also coined tight - binding systems ( tbss ) . for these systems",
    "quantum diffusion takes place on a lattice , where the sites are coupled by tunneling amplitudes , an important case being the restriction to nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the simplest example is the well - known spin - boson model @xcite with applications from condensed matter physics to electron transfer reactions .",
    "the fundamental role of tbss follows from the diversity of realizations in physics and chemistry @xcite .",
    "transport properties in general multistable systems at sufficiently low temperatures can be described within tbs models leading to relations to the kondo problem and the luttinger liquid model .",
    "further , tbss serve as archetypical models to study quantum phase transitions in correlated systems , as e.g.  for hubbard type of models .",
    "remarkably , even a large class of continuous systems can be mapped exactly onto tbss by means of duality transformations @xcite .",
    "based on the path integral representation exact non - markovian master equations for tbss @xcite have been derived , which provide the starting point for perturbative treatments such as the non - interacting blip approximation ( niba ) and reduce to markovian ones even for moderate dissipation and low temperatures @xcite , i.e.  far from the limiting ranges addressed above .",
    "the pimc approach is particularly suited to treat the dissipative real - time evolution of tbss numerically exactly . while former applications were restricted mainly to two and three state models @xcite , recently , we substantially improved the approach to apply to more complex systems @xcite , such as single charge transfer across long one - dimensional molecular chains including impurities and external driving fields . moreover , the simulation time range could be extended to cover basically all relevant time scales of the dissipative dynamics .",
    "we have been thus in a position to directly access the range of validity of markovian master equations for tbss , which in turn are extremely helpful to reveal the relevant physical processes behind the numerical data .",
    "the goal of this paper is now twofold : on the one hand we push the pimc procedure even further and present first results for the dissipative dynamics of spatially continuous and of correlated many - body systems ; on the other hand , we give arguments to what extent markovian master equations can be used in these more involved situations .",
    "we will see that this latter question will directly lead us to consider generalized tight - binding lattices with non - equidistant spacing between sites or in higher dimensions .",

    "[ sec1 ] with a brief summary of the path integral representation for open quantum systems and continue in sec .",

    "[ sec5 ] . at the end",
    "some conclusions are given .",
    "the standard approach @xcite for the inclusion of dissipation into a quantum mechanical formulation starts from a system+reservoir model @xmath0 with a system part @xmath1 , an environmental part @xmath2 , and a system - bath interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the reservoir ( heat bath ) is mimicked by a quasi - continuum of harmonic oscillators bilinearly coupled to the system : @xmath4 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes a system operator corresponding to a one - dimensional degree of freedom .",
    "dissipation appears when one considers the reduced dynamics by properly eliminating the bath degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath6 with an initial density matrix @xmath7 of the total system .",
    "it turns out that for the reduced dynamics the environmental parameters enter only via the spectral density @xmath8 which effectively becomes a continuous function of @xmath9 for a condensed - phase environment .",
    "note that in the above definition of the spectral density we have included a factor @xmath10 with @xmath11 being a proper length scale which is convenient for the treatment of tbss .",
    "the gaussian statistics of the isolated environment is determined by the complex - valued bath autocorrelation function which for real time @xmath12 reads @xmath13 \\over \\sinh(\\hbar\\beta\\omega/2 ) } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 .    in the sequel we focus on systems evolving in a discretized configuration space with respect to the pointer variable @xmath15 and",
    "thus consider the population @xmath16 of a `` lattice site '' @xmath17 determined by the diagonal part of the reduced density matrix , i.e. , @xmath18 which is normalized @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , the initial density matrix of the total compound @xmath7 in ( [ reduced ] ) is taken to be @xmath20 with the partition function of the isolated reservoir @xmath21 .",
    "the bath is equilibrated according to a localized initial state of the system on a lattice site @xmath22 , where @xmath23 so that e.g.  for electron transfer in a polar environment , @xmath24 is the electronic dipol moment and @xmath25 the collective dipol moment of the bath .",
    "generalizations to delocalized initial states for the system are straightforward @xcite .",
    "the path integral representation provides a formally exact expression for the reduced dynamics and is thus the starting point for a numerically exact monte - carlo ( mc ) scheme . along the lines sketched above ,",
    "the bath degrees of freedom are eliminated exactly to arrive at the reduced dynamics . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one thus obtains for eq .",

    "( [ populations path - integral ] ) is possible only numerically . in this situation",
    "the pimc method has been proven as a very promising approach to obtain numerically exact results even in regions of parameter space where other approximate methods fail .",
    "a prerequisite for an efficient numerical algorithm is an appropriate discretization of time and configuration space .",
    "the latter one is intrinsically given for multistable systems in the tight binding limit , where the relevant states are strongly localized in position , only very weakly coupled by tunneling , and energetically well separated from the rest of the spectrum . for spatially continuous systems supporting delocalized states the situation is less obvious , but in case of a discrete energy spectrum a mapping onto a generalized tight - binding lattice applies as well for lower temperatures @xcite . in any case , the configuration space variable can then be written as @xmath37 with a typical length scale @xmath11 and a dimensionless variable @xmath38 with @xmath39 according to a @xmath40-level system ( @xmath40ls ) .",
    "hence , the system hamiltonian reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 describes the energetic distribution of the sites according to @xmath43 and @xmath44 the couplings between them @xmath45 . in particular , in case of @xmath46 and nearest neighbor coupling",
    "only one recovers a @xmath47-spin - boson model .    for the discretization in time ,",

    "equations  ( [ pop - discretized ] ) , ( [ density ] ) and ( [ influence ] ) constitute a discretized form of the populations ( [ populations ] ) and thus provide a starting point for pimc simulations .",
    "as it is well - known this method is handicapped by the dynamical sign problem @xcite .",
    "it originates from quantum interferences between different system paths @xmath75 , causing a small signal - to - noise ratio of the stochastic averaging procedure .",
    "one approach to deal with this problem is based on the observation that the quasi - classical paths @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ influence ] ) can be integrated out as a series of @xmath77 matrix multiplications @xcite .",
    "this reduces the degrees of freedom from the @xmath78 variables @xmath79 to the @xmath77 quantum variables @xmath80 and therefore significantly improves the numerical stability of the corresponding mc simulations .",
    "while this technique , which in fact is yet another example of a blocking approach @xcite , works greatly for dissipative two- and three - state systems @xcite , however , the increasing size of the corresponding matrices with the number of electronic sites turns these multiplications into a quite time consuming task .",
    "since they have to be performed for every single update of the mc trajectory , the investigation of larger systems again requires exceptionally long cpu times .",
    "nevertheless , this severe computational bottleneck can be profoundly alleviated on physical grounds @xcite . upon closer inspection",
    "one finds that the possibility of rewriting the integration over the quasi - classical coordinates in terms of simple matrix multiplications is due to the fact that the real - valued part of the bath autocorrelation function ( [ lz ] ) governs only the _ quantum coordinates _ but not the quasi - classical ones .",
    "this real - valued part , which eventually leads to a damping out of quantum coherences , introduces a non - local self - coupling among the quantum coordinates and is thus directly related to retardation effects , a main complication for treating dissipative quantum systems .",
    "accordingly , the retardation effects influence the evolution of the quasi - classical coordinates contained in the imaginary part of the influence functional to a significantly weaker extend than that of the quantum coordinates . neglecting them",
    "while generating the mc trajectories leads to an only minor impairment of the sampling statistics , but causes an almost complete decoupling between quantum and quasi - classical coordinates .",
    "this in turn allows for an enormous speed - up of the matrix multiplications .",
    "accordingly , the sampling process could so far be accelerated by a factor of approximately 100 with respect to the original approach @xcite ( for further details , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite ) , thus opening the door to treat the reduced dynamics of much larger and even many - body systems over sufficiently long times .",
    "from the exact expression ( [ populations path - integral ] ) for the reduced density simplifications can be derived in certain limits in terms of time - local master equations . in the context discussed here , these are of crucial importance , mainly since ( i ) master equations allow to study ranges in parameter space where the monte carlo sampling is rather expensive , e.g.  for very weak or very strong friction , and ( ii ) they provide a basis to access the physical processes underlying the numerical data also by means of analytical techniques .    in the weak friction limit one imposes that the level broadening due to friction is much smaller than @xmath81 _ and _ the typical level separation .",
    "it is thus natural to work in the basis spanned by the energy eigenstates of @xmath1 and to treat the coupling @xmath3 perturbatively .",
    "with increasing coupling , however , the environment drives the system to its pointer basis in which the system - bath coupling operator @xmath15 is diagonal . as we have seen above in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , in this basis the path integral formulation allows for a non - perturbative elimination of the reservoir degrees of freedom . in case that friction is very strong and thus level broadening much larger than level spacing and temperature , a master equation complementary to the weak friction range , the quantum smoluchowski equation , is again available @xcite .",
    "what s about the intermediate regime ?",
    "for tbss discussed here , substantial findings have been gained in the past decade @xcite .",
    "namely , it was shown that an _",
    "exact _ retarded master equation exists , i.e. , @xmath82 where the kernels obey @xmath83 .",
    "basically they represent a power series in the couplings @xmath84 with corresponding spin - path integrals .",
    "to make the latter tractable , one applies the niba @xcite or its generalization , the non - interacting cluster approximation ( nica ) @xcite , which has been shown to be accurate in a variety of parameter ranges .",
    "for instance , in case of an ohmic spectral density with a high frequency cut - off , it captures quantum coherence as well as pure relaxation dynamics .",
    "the corresponding kernels @xmath85 read in lowest order in the intersite couplings @xmath86\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cos\\left[(\\epsilon_\\mu-\\epsilon_\\nu ) t+(q_\\mu - q_\\nu)^2\\ , q''(t)\\right]\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the practical use of ( [ exactme ] ) is limited though due to the retardation .",
    "now , for sufficiently strong dissipation and fast enough bath modes the kernel falls off on a time scale much shorter than the time scale on which the relevant reduced dynamics occurs so that we may set in ( [ exactme ] ) @xmath89 and @xmath90 accordingly , ( [ exactme ] ) reduces to a simple markovian rate equation @xmath91 with a rate matrix @xmath92 consisting of the individual rates @xmath93 . for nearest neighbor coupling ,",
    "the golden rule rates @xmath94 describe a sequential hopping process , while all higher order contributions to @xmath93 capture long - range hopping termed superexchange .",
    "note that in contrast to weak coupling master equations as e.g.the redfield equations , ( [ exactme ] ) and ( [ differential rate equation ] ) together with the corresponding transition rates apply also to the range of moderate to strong bath coupling and very low temperatures .    as an explicit example of ( [ differential rate equation ] ) we consider a one - dimensional tight - binding lattice with @xmath95 sites , spacing 1 , and constant nearest neighbor coupling corresponding to a spin-3-boson system ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "this model can be seen as a simple realization of electron transfer along a molecular chain subject to a dissipative environment @xcite .",
    "initially , the charge is localized at the donor site @xmath96 and @xmath97 monitors the dynamics towards the acceptor at @xmath98 .",
    "specifically , donor and acceptor are linked by a bridge with an impurity at its center .",
    "donor / acceptor have vanishing onsite energy , the bridge sites are elevated by @xmath99 , and the impurity site has @xmath100 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the exact pimc data are very accurately described by the time - local master equation ( [ differential rate equation ] ) despite the fact that all parameters are chosen such that one is close to a coherent / incoherent transition ( for the given values of @xmath71 and @xmath101 coherences appear at inverse temperatures @xmath102 and larger ) and @xmath103 is far from the scaling limit .",
    "in order to go beyond the spin - boson type of models ( one - dimensional tight binding lattice , equidistant spacing , constant nearest coupling ) , we start by presenting an approach to capture the dynamics of spatially continuous systems within the pimc procedure outlined above .",
    "it turns out that this method applies to systems with a discrete energy spectrum .",
    "the basic idea is simple : for sufficiently low temperatures only the lowest lying states of the isolated system can be assumed to take part in the dynamics ; thus , the full hilbert space @xmath1 can effectively be truncated to a subspace @xmath104 spanned by the @xmath105 lowest lying eigenstates .",
    "one then has to find a proper basis in this subspace , obtained by a unitary transformation from the eigenstate basis , in which a stochastic sampling of the path integrals ( [ populations path - integral ] ) can be performed .",
    "this sort of reduction is not new .",
    "in fact , the spin - boson model can be seen as originating from a double well potential , where only the two lowest lying states are taken into account .",
    "of course , the goal here is to go beyond : we want to capture the dissipative dynamics from very low up to moderate temperatures .",
    "for very high temperatures semi - classical or classical methods apply anyway .",
    "further , we are interested in the regime of moderate friction , where neither of the known approximate formulations work so that a numerical treatment has to start from the exact reduced dynamics ( [ populations path - integral ] ) .",
    "the proper basis for the sampling in the restricted hilbert space is then the basis that diagonalizes the operator @xmath5 in @xmath104 .",
    "this idea to treat spatially continuous systems has been first applied in the numerical quapi approach @xcite and has been recently analyzed in @xcite to derive a generalized master equation of the type given above ( [ exactme ] ) .",
    "hence , we sketch here only the central results briefly and refer to these previous works for further details .    in the @xmath105-dimensional subspace @xmath104 the pointer basis is defined as @xmath106 and obtained from the eigenstate basis @xmath107 by diagonalizing a matrix with entries @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "its eigenvalues provide the dimensionless @xmath110 , while the eigenvectors are given as @xmath111 .",
    "the basis set @xmath112 is also known as the dvr - basis ( discrete value representation ) . by representing the hamiltonian in this dvr - basis",
    ", one obtains `` onsite energies '' @xmath113 and `` intersite - couplings '' @xmath114 .",
    "the original system is thus mapped onto a generalized @xmath105-dimensional tight - binding lattice with _ non - equidistant _ sites at @xmath115 and _ non - nearest neighbor _",
    "couplings @xmath116 .",
    "now , to implement this tbs into the pimc algorithm , one has to take into account the non - equidistant lattice by re - defining the @xmath117 and @xmath118 variables properly .",
    "a rough estimate for the validity of the truncation procedure to the lowest @xmath105 eigenstates of the isolated system is given by the conditions that ( i ) the level broadening due to friction is of the same order as the level spacing or smaller and that ( ii ) the temperature is sufficiently low @xmath119 . while the second condition is obvious , the first one originates from the fact that for very strong friction the system tends to the classical limit again , see @xcite .    by way of example",
    ", we consider in the sequel a harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath120 and frequency @xmath121 , so that the typical length scale is @xmath122 .",
    "while a detailed account of the implementation into the pimc algorithm and results of simulations for specific observables , particularly in comparison with analytical results , will be given elsewhere , here , our main interest is to explicitly show that apart from the conditions for the applicability of time local master equations known for spin - boson models , the treatment of continuous systems via the described mapping comes with an additional complication .",
    "formally , this issue has also been addressed recently in @xcite . here",
    ", we directly compare numerically exact pimc data with results from the simplified master equation . for this purpose the initial state is chosen as one of the dvr - states which suffices to study the time evolution of the populations on the sites @xmath110 .",
    "results for @xmath123 and @xmath124 are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] for a bath with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . for this parameter set",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that time local master equations capture the exact dynamics of linear chains rather accurate even though one is close to an incoherent / coherent transition for the reduced dynamics .",
    "the same is true here for @xmath123 , where we used ( [ differential rate equation ] ) together with the hopping rates ( [ grfull ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath124 deviations appear in the short to intermediate time regime . for times of the order of @xmath128 and shorter ( @xmath129 ) ,",
    "these are caused by adiabatic effects in the bath well - known from the dynamics in ordinary tight binding lattices . in the intermediate time range , however , where for certain populations pronounced maxima occur , deviations must be ascribed a specific property related to the mapping onto a tight binding lattice with non - equidistant spacing . as mentioned above",
    ", this mapping requires a re - definition of the @xmath130 and @xmath131 variables , originally defined for a tight binding lattice with equidistant spacing of length @xmath11 .",
    "qualitatively , the situation is the following : since the variance of the @xmath105th eigenstate is roughly @xmath132 , the box in position space covered by @xmath105 states has a typical width @xmath133 .",
    "the mean spacing between adjacent lattice sites is thus @xmath134 .",
    "hence , compared to a lattice with equidistant spacing of length @xmath135 , the re - definition of the @xmath130 and @xmath131 variables in the influence functional ( [ influence ] ) comes with an additional factor of the order @xmath136 , which basically renormalizes the damping kernel .",
    "consequently , for fixed bath parameters and increasing @xmath105 , the effective coupling constant between bath and discrete system is not constant , but decreases as @xmath137 .",
    "the system is thus driven into the range of weak coupling to the bath @xcite , where retardation effects due to quantum coherences become more substantial .",
    "hence , the limit to a spatially continuous system @xmath138 is non - trivial and must be performed by keeping @xmath139 constant . specifically , by comparing the spectral density ( [ spectral ] ) with the one usually introduced for spatially continuous systems @xcite , one finds @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the macroscopic damping constant appearing in the classical langevin equation .",
    "note that the above relation can not be seen as a strict equality since the spacing between adjacent dvr - sites varies slightly and is typically smaller deep inside the potential well .",
    "the value @xmath126 chosen above corresponds for @xmath123 to @xmath142 and for @xmath124 to @xmath143 .",
    "now , a rough estimate for the validity of time local master equations can be gained by assuming that the exponential in ( [ grrate ] ) must fall off on a time scale sufficiently shorter than that of the dynamics of @xmath144 . for moderate and low temperatures ,",
    "this leads to @xmath145 and thus @xmath146 . in accordance with this relation , the pimc data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] for @xmath123 can still be captured quantitatively by ( [ differential rate equation ] ) , while for @xmath124 only a qualitative agreement can be seen . to perform",
    "the continuum limit is thus not an easy task and certainly deserves further research .",
    "the dissipative real - time evolution of interacting many body systems has been left basically untouched so far . in certain limits ,",
    "e.g.  for very strong repulsive interactions , results could be derived from a simple hopping model @xcite , but the intimate interplay between direct interaction , interaction mediated by the environment and dissipation has not been accessible . here , for the first time we present pimc results for the dynamics of two interacting particles along the lines described above . as in the previous section , in the sequel",
    "the formulation is outlined only briefly and we focus on conceptual properties related to time - local master equations .",
    "further , we consider the case of indistinguishable particles , called charges henceforth , so that the quantum nature of the particle statistics matters .",
    "physically , the situation refers to interacting spinless fermions or interacting bosons .",
    "the free system is taken as a tight - binding lattice with spacing 1 and nearest neighbor coupling , where the two charges can be placed on @xmath147 sites .",
    "accordingly , the two - charge hamilton operator reads @xmath148 + { u}\\right\\ } \\label{2hamilton}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are straightforward generalizations of the corresponding operators introduced above for the single particle case , while @xmath151 describes a site dependent coulomb interaction specified below .",
    "the coupling to the bath is determined by the total dipol - moment of the system and thus follows directly from ( [ hamilton ] ) : @xmath152 ^ 2\\right\\ }   \\label{total2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath153 .    since the two charges are indistinguishable it is convenient for the pimc simulation to work not in the single particle product basis , but rather in the basis of the many body states .",
    "for this purpose we introduce @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "the advantage of this representation is that the @xmath156 states @xmath157 are orthogonal in contrast to the original ones .",
    "accordingly , @xmath158 takes the form @xmath159\\ ] ] where now @xmath160 for an onsite coulomb energy this model is identical to a dissipative hubbard model with two charges .",
    "note , however , that for the pimc simulations a non - local interaction can easily be taken into account . now , as seen above , the free system dynamics enters in the discretized path integral formulation only through its short time propagator which is conveniently represented in the energy eigenbasis of @xmath158 in ( [ dhamilton ] ) , see ( [ sysprop2 ] ) .",
    "further , since in ( [ total2 ] ) the two charges interact with the bath only via the sum @xmath161 the corresponding change to the many body basis in the influence functional is straightforward .",
    "it amounts to introduce discretized sum and difference paths according to @xmath162 such that the influence functional depends only on @xmath163 and @xmath164 .    in principle",
    ", we could now start to implement the above representation into a pimc algorithm .",
    "however , before doing so we go one step further and exploit the following crucial property : _ the dissipative dynamics of two indistinguishable charges on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath40 sites is equivalent to the dissipative dynamics of a single particle on a two - dimensional triangular lattice with @xmath156 sites_. to see this , one realizes that the coupling to the bath @xmath165 with @xmath166 as in ( [ initial_perp_p ] ) can be written as @xmath167 with the vector operators @xmath168 and @xmath169 , thus being identical to the system - bath coupling of a single particle on a surface .",
    "eventually , by a proper re - labeling of the populations @xmath170 one formally obtains the desired mapping .",

    ", transitions can only occur in the vertical and the horizontal direction , respectively .",
    "note that this mapping can be generalized to fermionic systems as well .",
    "to summarize , the advantages of the many body basis and the subsequent mapping onto a single particle 2@xmath40-lattice are : ( i ) the pimc algorithm developed for single particles can be simply adapted to the case of two particles , ( ii ) the configuration space to be sampled is reduced from @xmath174 to @xmath156 , and ( iii ) the master equations introduced in the previous section can be directly applied .",
    "let us now analyze ( iii ) in more detail based on ( [ differential rate equation ] ) with the corresponding transition rates ( [ grfull ] ) .",
    "the simplest case is @xmath175 with only three available sites @xmath176 .",
    "obviously , for this case the triangular lattice coincides with a linear chain with three sites so that if a time local master equation applies for this latter case , it also applies for the two - charge case . for larger @xmath40 , however , the situation changes fundamentally due to a different topology of the two - dimensional lattices which then contain bulk - sites with four adjacent sites ( apart from @xmath177 where there is no bulk site , but two edge - sites with three connections ) .",
    "accordingly , the typical dwell time on a bulk - site is considerably shorter than on a site with two connections , roughly , by a factor of 2 .",
    "an environment which is able to destroy the phase coherence of the wave function on each site of a linear chain before a jump to an adjacent site takes place , may be too slow to achieve the same on bulk - sites in a 2d - lattice .",
    "hence , entangled many body states can survive on such a long time scale that a description based on a master equation local in time fails .",
    "in fact , this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where pimc data for @xmath178 are depicted together with the corresponding dynamics of the master equation ( [ differential rate equation ] ) . by successively removing more and more bulk sites from the lattice , the agreement of the pimc data with the prediction of the master equation , which is rather poor in case of the full lattice , increases , until upon creating a linear chain by removing all bulk states an almost perfect match is regained .",
    "the situation becomes even worse for a larger number of charges @xmath179 since then the bulk sites of the @xmath179-dimensional cube attain @xmath180 decay channels to adjacent sites , thus reducing the average dwell time by a factor of about @xmath180 compared to the one - dimensional case @xmath181 .",
    "the conclusion is the following : if for a bath characterized by @xmath71 and @xmath182 a markovian approximation applies for the dynamics on a 1d - lattice with nearest neighbor coupling @xmath183 , i.e.  @xmath184 and @xmath185 , this approximation fails for the multi - charge dynamics , unless @xmath71 is taken to be very large and temperatures are sufficiently high , roughly , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "hence , for most cases only numerical approaches like the pimc procedure presented here , seem to be applicable .",
    "the numerically exact pimc approach has been pushed further to deal also with spatially continuous systems and correlated many - body dynamics . to better understand the numerical data in certain parameter ranges , to estimate the dissipative quantum dynamics before starting an involved pimc calculation , and even to develop simplified models capturing the relevant processes , markovian master equations are of great practical use . to explore their applicability in the above situations",
    ", we had to consider generalized tight - binding lattices with either non - equidistant spacing or in higher dimensions . in both cases ,",
    "additional restrictions must be imposed beyond the constraints known from equidistant one - dimensional tbss so that for broader ranges of bath parameters no simple description seems to be possible .",
    "however , it is surprising that in other domains comprising stronger dissipation and lower temperatures , markovian master equations can still be found to work quite well , at least qualitatively .",
    "thus , markovian master equations together with numerically exact pimc simulations , which often provide the sole mean to check for their validity in a certain scenario , provide a powerful means to study dynamical properties over the full time range . in particular , for the correlated many - body dynamics in presence of dissipation this may open the door to examine the intimate interplay between coulomb interaction , particle statistics , and phonon baths , e.g.  for the charge transport in molecular and mesoscopic structures .",
