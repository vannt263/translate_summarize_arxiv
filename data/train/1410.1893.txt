    "probably , one of the best - known mechanisms for producing cosmic seed magnetic fields is the biermann battery effect ( biermann 1950 ) , which should operate during the formation of the large - scale structure and can produce a seed field of order @xmath4 g .",

    "the magnetic field lines are stretched by turbulent motions at the viscous - cutoff scale , also known as the kolmogorov scale . since the viscous - cutoff scale is close to the outer scale of turbulence in high magnetic prandtl number fluids ,",
    "the kinetic energy density at the viscous - cutoff scale is not much smaller than that of the outer scale .",
    "therefore , the exponential growth stage lasts for a long time until the magnetic energy density becomes comparable to the kinetic energy density at the outer scale of turbulence . in other words ,",
    "the system is in exponential growth stage most of the time in high magnetic prandtl number turbulence .    during the exponential growth stage ,",

    "we use 22 forcing components in the wavenumber range @xmath57 , which means the driving scale @xmath11 is @xmath58 . in our simulations , @xmath591 before saturation .",

    "if we compare the rates of expansion for @xmath135 and for @xmath136 in figure  [ fig : k20jpg ] , the rates look similar , which implies that the expansion rate is linear in time .",
    "indeed the lower panel of figure  [ fig : k20 t ] shows that the standard deviation of magnetic field distribution ( the dashed curve ; see equation  ( [ eq : sig3d ] ) for definition ) shows a linear growth after a certain time , before which its behavior is very similar to that of a passive scalar field ( the solid curve ) .",
    "this behavior is very similar to that of a localized seed magnetic field in unit magnetic prandtl number turbulence ( see cho 2013 for numerical methods and detailed discussions ) .",
    "if the initially magnetized region is smaller than the viscous - cutoff scale @xmath137 , the expansion speed of the magnetized region can be slower than @xmath138 .",
    "let the size of the initially magnetized region be @xmath139 .",
    "if @xmath140 , then it takes @xmath141 for the magnetic field to fill the ` host ' eddy at the viscous - cutoff scale . after filling the viscous - cutoff - scale eddy , it would take @xmath60 for the magnetic field to fill the whole outer - scale eddy .",
    "therefore , in this case , magnetization of the outer - scale eddy takes @xmath142 the expansion rate of the magnetized region on scales larger than the outer scale of turbulence will be @xmath143 for a cluster with @xmath90400 kpc and @xmath14430 kpc , we will have @xmath145 if @xmath146 .",
    "but , for this @xmath9 , slowdown of the expansion rate will be negligible ( see equation ( [ eq : slowdown ] ) ) .",
    "slowdown of the expansion rate will be important when @xmath14713 in the cluster .",
    "note , however , that , if the magnetized materials in jets or stripped gases provide seeding , the initially magnetized region can be up to hundreds - of - kpc - long and , therefore , @xmath9 can be smaller than this .    in the ism of galaxies , strength of the magnetic fields ranges from @xmath148 g ( diffuse ism ) to @xmath149 mg ( molecular clouds )",
    "when these gases are expelled from galaxies , magnetic fields in them will be attenuated due to expansion of the media .",
    "this makes the strength of the localized seed magnetic fields weaker than the galactic values .",
    "if a linear size of the medium expands by a factor of @xmath150 during the ejection , magnetic field becomes weaker by a factor of @xmath151 .",
    "the magnetic attenuation factor @xmath151 is uncertain and may depend on the ejection mechanism .",
    "if a galactic material is ejected via jets or explosions , the expansion factor can be very large .",
    "for example , if a jet is launched from a sub - pc scale and ultimately expands to kpc - scales , the expansion factor can be larger than @xmath152 ( see related discussions in brandenburg & subramanian 2005 ; widrow et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , if a magnetized gas is stripped from a galaxy , the expansion factor can be smaller than @xmath152 .",
    "another factor that can affect the strength of the seed fields is existence of turbulence inside ejecta .",
    "if turbulence exists inside the ejected media , turbulence dynamo can mitigate attenuation of the magnetic fields .",
    "if we use the turbulence dynamo models , we can test whether or not the high magnetic prandtl number turbulence is a correct model for the icm or the intergalactic medium .",
    "suppose that we can observe distribution of magnetic fields in filaments .",
    "if distribution of magnetic fields in filaments is more or less homogeneous , it is likely that the high magnetic prandtl number turbulence model is incorrect .",
    "if we find magnetic fields only near the astrophysical sources , we may be able to conclude that magnetic fields in filaments have astrophysical origins , rather than primordial .",
    "the use of an incompressible code has the advantage that we can easily control the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity . however",
    ", it is not possible to study the effects of compression with the incompressible code . in galaxy clusters , shocks and mergers",
    "can compress fluids and have a pronounced impact on the growth of magnetic field ( roettiger et al 1999 ; dolag et al .",
    "1999 , 2002 ; iapichino & brggen 2012 ) . for example , a simulation by dolag et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows that the mean magnetic field within a cluster of comoving radius 1 mpc increases by a factor of @xmath153 from redshift z=0.8 to z=0 .",
    "if this is a typical growth factor for compression amplification , the minimum strength of a uniform magnetic field for @xmath9=160 should be decreased by the same factor : a new minimum strength will be a few times @xmath154 g .",
    "note , however , that @xmath9 in actual clusters is likely to be much smaller than @xmath129 ( see equation ( [ eq : reicm ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , if we take into account both the compression amplification and a realistic @xmath9 , the minimum strength may not be much smaller than @xmath1 g .",
    "it is likely that the central region of a galaxy cluster has formed at a much earlier stage . during these early stages ,",
    "many of the physical properties , including the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath9 , could be different .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that some magnetization has occurred already at earlier stages , which can alleviate the constraints found in this paper .",
    "however , unless such central regions were substantially cooler and/or denser than present - day central regions , the effect may not be significant .",
    "note that , even in present - day cool cores , @xmath9 is expected to be less than @xmath155 ( schekochihin & cowley 2006 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have considered turbulence dynamo models in unit and high magnetic prandtl number fluids .",
    "we have found the following results :    1 .   in high magnetic prandtl number turbulence ( with a hydrodynamic reynolds number , @xmath9 , less than @xmath0 ) ,",
    "turbulence dynamo is not so efficient that a primordial seed magnetic field weaker than a certain critical value can not be a direct origin of magnetic fields in the icm . for a cluster with driving scale of @xmath16400 kpc and turbulence velocity of @xmath16400 km / s ,",
    "the critical strength is @xmath156 g for @xmath120 , which is very close to an upper limit of @xmath2 g placed by the cmb anisotropy observations .",
    "the critical strengths for seed magnetic fields ejected from galaxies or first stars are about two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "but , since the strengths of magnetic fields in those astrophysical objects are likely to be larger than @xmath3 g , it may not be so difficult for the seed magnetic fields ejected from the astrophysical bodies to have strengths larger than the critical values .",
    "therefore , our calculations favor astrophysical origin of magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "2 .   if the high magnetic prandtl number model is correct for clusters and filaments , pre - galactic magnetic fields generated by a battery effect , amplified in galaxies or first stars , and ejected from them later into intergalactic space would be plausible sources of magnetic fields in the large - scale structure of the universe .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly review turbulence dynamo models in unit magnetic prandtl number turbulence and discuss their implications .",
    "we assume that the fluid is incompressible and that both the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity are very small . when the magnetic prandtl number is unity , the velocity and the magnetic dissipation scales coincide .",
    "if a seed magnetic field has a primordial origin , the coherence length of the seed field can be very large and , therefore , it can be regarded as spatially uniform on the scale of galaxy clusters .",
    "even if the primordial seed magnetic field has a small coherence length ( see , for example , banerjee & jedamzik 2004 ; wagstaff et al .",

    "therefore , the distance grow exponentially , so does magnetic energy density .",
    "( c ) since the characteristic scale in ( b ) is @xmath166 , the magnetic energy spectrum peaks near the dissipation wavenumber @xmath24 .",

    "( d ) in summary , the magnetic field grows in 3 steps : exponential growth , linear growth , and saturation . when the hydrodynamic reynolds number ( @xmath9 ) approaches infinity , the duration of the exponential growth stage becomes zero .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    \\(1 ) the stretching of the magnetic field lines occurs most actively near the velocity dissipation scale first .",
    "this is because eddy turnover time is shortest , hence the rate of field - line stretching is highest , at the dissipation scale .",
    "suppose that we introduce a weak uniform seed magnetic field in a turbulent medium ( see figure [ fig:1](a ) ) .",
    "let us select two points on a magnetic field line whose separation is of order @xmath166 , where @xmath166 is the velocity dissipation scale ( figure [ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "after approximately one eddy turnover time , @xmath167 , where @xmath165 is the velocity at the dissipation scale , the distance between the two points along the field line will be doubled . after approximately another eddy turnover time @xmath28 , the distance between the two points along the field line will be doubled again .",
    "therefore , magnetic field lines are stretched exponentially and , as a result , the magnetic energy density grows exponentially .",
    "note that the typical scale of the magnetic field - line variation , which is of order @xmath166 , does not change during the process .",
    "therefore , the magnetic energy spectrum peaks near @xmath168 and , as time goes on , it goes upward without changing its shape much ( figure [ fig:1](c ) ) .",
    "\\(2 ) as the magnetic energy spectrum moves upward , it will finally touch up the kinetic energy spectrum at the dissipation scale .",
    "then what will happen ?",
    "when the magnetic energy spectrum becomes comparable to the kinetic energy spectrum at the dissipation scale , magnetic back - reaction suppresses stretching of magnetic field lines at the dissipation scale . due to the suppression , the exponential growth stage ends .",
    "note , however , that stretching at scales larger than @xmath166 is still efficient because the kinetic energy spectrum is still higher than the magnetic energy spectrum at the scales .",
    "therefore , now the scale slightly larger than the dissipation scale becomes the most active scale for stretching .",
    "this way , the subsequent stage is characterized by a slower growth of magnetic energy and a gradual shift of the peak of the magnetic energy spectrum to larger scales ( cho & vishniac 2000 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the magnetic energy density at this stage turns out to be linear ( schlter & biermann 1950 ; schekochihin & cowley 2007 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the amplification of magnetic field stops when the magnetic energy density becomes comparable to the kinetic energy density at the outer - scale of turbulence and a final , statistically steady , saturation stage begins . during the saturation stage ,",
    "the peak of the magnetic energy spectrum occurs at a wavenumber a few times larger than that of the kinetic energy spectrum ( cho & vishniac 2000 ) .    in the vanishing viscosity ( and diffusivity )",
    "limit , the duration of the exponential growth stage will be very short .",
    "nevertheless , since the eddy turnover time at the dissipation scale is arbitrarily small in the limit , any weak seed field can grow exponentially , reach the equipartition strength at the dissipation scale , and enter the linear growth stage within arbitrarily small amount of time .",
    "therefore , in the vanishing viscosity limit , 1 ) the exponential growth stage shown in figure [ fig:1](d ) becomes invisible , 2 ) @xmath169 shows linear growth most of the time before saturation , and 3 ) regardless of the strength of the initial seed field , @xmath169 follows virtually the same curve of growth when @xmath82 is plotted in a linear scale as in figure [ fig:1](d ) . according to simulations ( e.g. cho et al .",
    "2009 ; cho & yoo 2012 ) , the system reaches the saturation stage in @xmath125 .",
    "amplification of a localized seed magnetic field was studied in detail by cho & yoo ( 2012 ) and cho ( 2013 ) .",
    "if a seed magnetic field is localized in space , turbulent motions make the seed magnetic field transported out from the region of initial injection ( figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "cho ( 2013 ) found that the rate at which the magnetized region expands is @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the _ homogenization timescale _ ( or the magnetization timescale ) , the time required for the magnetic field to fill the whole system , is given by @xmath170 if the driving scale is comparable to the size of the system , @xmath171 , then homogenization happens fast , i.e.  within @xmath172 times the large - eddy turnover time @xmath25 , and the subsequent evolution should be similar to that of a uniform / homogeneous seed magnetic field case ( cho & yoo 2012 ) .",
    "the whole system reaches the saturation stage within @xmath173 . on the other hand , if the driving scale is less than @xmath174 , i.e.  if @xmath175 , the magnetic field near the initial injection cite reaches the equipartition strength @xmath38 before the magnetic field fills the whole system . in this case , it takes more than @xmath176 for the whole system to reach the saturation stage .    as in uniform / homogeneous seed field cases ,",
    "as long as the strength of the seed magnetic field is sufficiently weaker than the equipartition strength , its absolute value does not matter much in the vanishing viscosity limit .",
    "first , because weak magnetic fields are passively transported and stretched by turbulent motions , the homogenization timescale @xmath177 , which is mainly determined by large - scale turbulent motions , is similar for all weak seed magnetic fields .",
    "second , as in the uniform / homogeneous seed field cases , the strength of the weak seed fields does not affect the saturation time much .",
    "therefore , the turbulence dynamo process should be similar for sufficiently weak localized seed magnetic fields .      since turbulence dynamo is so efficient in the vanishing viscosity limit that it is difficult to find a constraint on the strength of the initial seed magnetic field .",
    "this is true for both the primordial and the astrophysical seed magnetic fields .",
    "however , it might be possible to tell the origin of the cosmic magnetism by observing the distribution of magnetic field in some systems .",
    "the key quantity is the homogenization timescale , @xmath177 .",
    "suppose that a localized seed magnetic field is injected into a system .",
    "if @xmath177 is short compared with the age of the universe , the system becomes homogenized quickly and the subsequent evolution will be very similar to that of a uniform seed magnetic field . therefore , in this case , it will be very difficult to distinguish the astrophysical and the primordial seed magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath177 is longer than the hubble time , the system has not been yet completely magnetized .",
    "therefore , in this case , the magnetic field in the system will be very inhomogeneous .",
    "consider a cluster of galaxies with @xmath1781 mpc . in this case , if @xmath179 km / s , which is very likely , the homogenization timescale is shorter than the hubble time",
    ". therefore , it will be very difficult to distinguish the primordial and the astrophysical origins of magnetic fields in clusters .",

    "<S> if they were ejected from astrophysical bodies , they were highly localized in space at the time of injection . in this paper , using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic prandtl number fluids , we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic reynolds number based on the spitzer viscosity in the intracluster medium ( icm ) is believed to be less than @xmath0 , while the magnetic reynolds number can be much larger than that . in this case , if the seed magnetic fields have primordial origins , they should be stronger than @xmath1 g , which is very close to the upper limit of @xmath2 g set by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if the seed magnetic fields were ejected from astrophysical bodies , any seed magnetic fields stronger than @xmath2 g can safely magnetize the intracluster medium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is less likely that primordial magnetic fields are the direct origin of present - day magnetic fields in the icm . </S>"
