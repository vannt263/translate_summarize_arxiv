    "the standard model ( sm ) explains current high energy experiments , but it offers no understanding of many parameters included in the sm ( e.g. the fermion masses and the flavor mixing angles ) . it is expected that there exist some fundamental theory which includes the sm as a low energy effective theory . this theory should offer a deeper understanding of these parameters .",
    "if some reasonable relations among the sm parameters could be discovered phenomenologically , it would provide us with important clue toward the search for the fundamental theory .",
    "recently the top quark has been discovered and its mass has been measured .",
    "more precise data on elements of the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix @xcite will be available in the near future , e.g. from the experiments at the @xmath0-factories . thus it is timely to study the quark mass matrices and the km matrix through various phenomenological approaches . up to now , many attempt have been made to investigate the explicit connection between the quark mixing matrix and quark mass matrices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we present exact relations between the general mass matrices and the flavor mixing matrix .",
    "this approach is obviously advantageous over many specific @xmath1 and can model - independently shed light on the origin of quark masses and flavor mixing .    in this work ,",
    "we start from the nearest - neighbor interactions ( nni ) form of quark mass matrices .",
    "have shown that any @xmath2 quark mass matrices can be transformed into the nni basis form both up and down part at the same time , so we do not lose any generality by using this basis @xcite .",
    "the up and down mass matrices have twelve parameters , we fix six of them so that the six quark masses can be correctly reproduced .",
    "further more we show that two real parameters can be chosen to be _ any _ value .",
    "the remaining four parameters are obtained from the measurements of the km matrix .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : nni ] , we review the nni form of the mass matrices . in section [ sec : free ] , we separate out the two arbitrary degrees of freedom of the nni basis .",
    "these two degrees of freedom can be chosen implicitly and will not change any observable . in section [ sec : epsf ] , we show how to separate the elements of quark mass matrices in terms of quark masses and dimensionless parameters on the nni basis . in section [ sec :",
    "exact_km ] , exact analytical calculation of the km matrix is presented . in section [ sec : sum ] , we specialize our result to the fritzsch @xmath1 and summarize our results .",
    "_ nni basis _    it has been shown that the arbitrary up and down part @xmath2 quark mass matrices can be simultaneously transformed into the nni form without changing any observable quantities @xcite .",
    "that is , this transformation itself does not change the values of quark masses and the km matrix elements .",
    "hence the nni form includes all physical contents of quark mass matrices in the sm . in this basis",
    "each mass matrix has four texture zeros , so it is very simple .",
    "generally , @xmath2 mass matrices in the nni basis can be written as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the top and bottom quark masses , respectively .",
    "note that in the nni form , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are chosen real and non - negative and the phases are moved to a diagonal phase matrix @xmath8 shown below . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are diagonalized by orthogonal matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 through @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the up , charm , down and strange quark masses , respectively .",
    "we can write the km matrix @xmath18 by reparametrizing the right handed quark field phases , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the phase - difference matrix between the up and down quark sectors .",
    "_ degrees of freedom _    there are twelve real parameters in the above nni form , although the number of observable parameters is ten , that is , the six quark masses and four measurements of the km matrix . remaining two degrees of freedom are those of the choice of the nni basis .",
    "any mass matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be transformed into the above nni basis mass matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 without changing the values of the quark masses and the km matrix through @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unitary matrices .",
    "( here , the matrix @xmath8 is displayed in ( [ eqn : phase ] ) . ) in order to construct @xmath28 , we choose some non - vanishing complex value @xmath29 at first .",
    "then , using @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30 @xmath31 as the eigenvector of the matrix @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",

    "we can write @xmath29 and @xmath34 in terms of the elements of the nni basis mass matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 as follows : @xmath36",
    "therefore we can fix two arbitrary degrees of freedom of the nni basis by fixing the complex number @xmath29 .",
    "obviously from the above calculations , this fixing does not require any constraint to the quark masses and the km matrix .    in another way",
