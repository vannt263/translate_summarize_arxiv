    "the minimal standard model ( msm ) of electroweak interactions @xcite is in complete agreement with all precision experimental data ( lepii , tevatron , sld ) , with the notable exception of neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . in this minimal version",
    "there is one complex @xmath2 doublet which provides mass for the fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking three of the four real degrees of freedom initially present in the higgs doublet become the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , leaving one degree of freedom which manifests itself as a physical particle ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass ( @xmath6 ) is not fixed by the model , although constraints on @xmath6 can be obtained by making additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "these include the unitarity bound ( @xmath7 gev ) @xcite and the triviality bound @xcite . so far no experimental information on the nature of the higgs particle has been found , and from the negative searches in the higgsstrahlung channel at lepii the lower bound @xmath8 gev @xcite has been derived .    in recent years",
    "there has been growing interest in the study of extended higgs sectors with more than one doublet @xcite .",
    "the simplest extension of the msm is the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) , which is formed by adding an extra complex @xmath9 scalar doublet to the msm lagrangian .",
    "motivations for such a structure include cp  violation in the higgs sector , supersymmetry , and a possible solution to the cosmological domain wall problem @xcite .",
    "in particular , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite takes the form of a constrained thdm .    the most general thdm scalar potential which is renormalizable",
    ", gauge invariant and cp invariant depends on ten parameters , but such a potential can still break cp spontaneously @xcite . in order to ensure that tree - level flavour changing neutral currents are eliminated , a discrete symmetry ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a scalar doublet ) may be imposed on the lagrangian @xcite , which reduces the number of free parameters to 6 .",
    "the resulting potential was considered in @xcite , and is referred to as @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "we shall be concerned with the potential described in @xcite which is equivalent to @xmath12 plus a term which breaks the discrete symmetry ( parametrized by @xmath13 ) and contains 7 free parameters .",
    "such a potential does not break cp spontaneously or explicitly @xcite,@xcite provided that all the parameters are real .",
    "we note here that tree - level unitarity constraints for the thdm scalar potential @xmath12 were studied in @xcite .",
    "when deriving constraints from unitarity , @xcite considered only seven elastic scattering processes @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a higgs scalar ) while @xcite considered a larger scattering ( @xmath16 ) matrix . in @xcite , upper bounds on the higgs masses were derived , in particular @xmath17 gev for @xmath18 , with the bound becoming stronger as @xmath1 increases .",
    "we improve those studies for @xmath12 by including the full scalar @xmath16 matrix which includes channels which were absent in @xcite , and we also show graphically the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    to our knowledge",
    "such unitarity constraints have not been considered for the case of @xmath19 and this is the principal aim of this note .",
    "we shall see that the presence of a non - zero @xmath13 can significantly weaken the unitarity bounds found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a short review of the thdm potential and explain the unitarity approach we will be using . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results for the cases of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the most general thdm scalar potential which is invariant under @xmath9 and conserves cp is given by : @xmath22 &   & \\lambda_{4}(|\\phi_{1}|^2 |\\phi_{2}|^2 - |\\phi_{1}^+\\phi_{2}|^2   ) + \\lambda_{5 } ( re(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2 } ) -v_{1}v_{2})^2 + \\lambda_{6 } [ im(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2})]^2   \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 have weak hypercharge y=1 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the vacuum expectation values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the @xmath27 s are real  valued parameters .",
    "@xmath28 this potential violates the discrete symmetry @xmath10 softly by the dimension 2 term @xmath29 and has the same general structure of the scalar potential of the mssm .",
    "one can prove easily that for @xmath20 the exact symmetry @xmath30 is recovered .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the w and z gauge bosons acquire masses given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 gauge couplings and @xmath37 .",
    "the combination @xmath38 is thus fixed by the electroweak scale through @xmath39 , and we are left with 7 free parameters in eq.([higgspot ] ) , namely the @xmath40 s and @xmath41 . meanwhile , three of the eight degrees of freedom of the two higgs doublets correspond to the 3 goldstone bosons ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and the remaining five become physical higgs bosons : @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( cp  even ) , @xmath46 ( cp  odd ) and @xmath47 .",
    "their masses are obtained as usual by the shift @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "after generating the scalar masses in term of scalar parameters @xmath27 , using straightforward algebra one can express all the @xmath27 as functions of the physical masses : @xmath49    -\\frac{\\lambda_5}{4}(-1 + \\tan^2\\beta ) \\label{lambda1 } \\\\ & & \\lambda_2 = \\frac{g^2}{8 \\mbox{s}_\\beta^2 m^2_w } [ \\mbox{s}_\\alpha^2 m^2_h+ \\mbox{c}_\\alpha^2 m^2_h - \\mbox{s}_\\alpha \\mbox{c}_\\alpha \\tan\\beta(m^2_h - m^2_h ) ]    -\\frac{\\lambda_5}{4}(-1 + \\frac{1}{\\tan^2\\beta } ) \\label{lambda1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the angle @xmath50 diagonalizes both the cp  odd and charged scalar mass matrices , leading to the physical states @xmath47 and @xmath46 . the angle @xmath51 diagonalizes the cp  even mass matrix leading to the physical states @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "we are free to take as 7 independent parameters @xmath52 and @xmath1 or equivalently the four scalar masses , @xmath1 , @xmath51 and one of the @xmath27 . in what follows we will take @xmath13 as a free parameter .    to constrain the scalar potential parameters one can demand that tree - level unitarity is preserved in a variety of scattering processes .",
    "this corresponds to the requirement that the @xmath53 partial waves ( @xmath54 ) for scalar - scalar and gauge boson scalar scattering satisfy @xmath55 in the high - energy limit . at very high - energy , the equivalence theorem @xcite states that the amplitude of a scattering process involving longitudinal gauge bosons @xmath56 may be approximated by the scalar amplitude in which gauge bosons are replaced by their corresponding goldstone bosons @xmath57",
    "we conclude that unitarity constraints can be implemented by solely considering pure scalar scattering .    in very high energy collisions",
    ", it can be shown that the dominant contribution to the amplitude of the two - body scattering @xmath58 is the one which is mediated by the quartic coupling . those contributions mediated by trilinear couplings are suppressed on dimensional grounds . therefore the unitarity constraint @xmath59 reduces to the following constraint on the quartic coupling , @xmath60 . in what follows our attention",
    "will be focussed on the the quartic couplings .    in order to derive the unitarity constraints on the scalar masses",
    "we will adopt the technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in previous works @xcite that the quartic scalar vertices written in terms of physical fields @xmath47 , @xmath42 , @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath43 , are very complicated functions of @xmath27 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "however the quartic vertices ( computed before electroweak symmetry breaking ) written in terms of the non - physical fields @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( i=1,2 ) are considerably simpler expressions .",
    "the crucial point of @xcite is the fact that the @xmath16 matrix expressed in terms of the physical fields ( i.e. the mass eigenstate fields ) can be transformed into an @xmath16 matrix for the non - physical fields @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 by making a unitarity transformation .",
    "the latter is relatively easy to compute from eq .",
    "[ higgspot ] .",
    "therefore the full set of scalar scattering processes can be expressed as an @xmath16 matrix composed of 4 submatrices which do not couple with each other due to charge conservation and cp - invariance .",
    "the entries are the quartic couplings which mediate the scattering processes .",
    "the first submatrix corresponds to scatterings whose initial and final states are one of the following : @xmath64,@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "therefore one obtains a @xmath70 matrix leading to the following 5 distinct eigenvalues : @xmath71    the second submatrix corresponds to scatterings with initial and final states one of the following : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "again we obtain a @xmath70 matrix with the following 6 eigenvalues : @xmath78 the third submatrix corresponds to the basis : @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 matrix possesses the eigenvalues @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "all the above eigenvalues agree with those found in @xcite , up to a factor of @xmath84 which we have factorised out . in our analysis",
    "we also include the two body scattering between the 8 charged states : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "note that these channels were neglected in @xcite .",
    "the 8@xmath938 submatrix obtained from the above scattering processes contains many vanishing elements , and the 8 eigenvalues are straightforward to obtain analytically .",
    "they read as follows : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath82 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 as one can see , these additional channels lead only to one extra eigenvalue , @xmath98 , although we shall see that this eigenvalue plays an important role in constraining @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in this section we present our results for the unitarity constraints on the higgs masses in the thdm .",
    "all the eigenvalues are constrained as follows : @xmath102 in @xcite the eigenvalues explicitly contain the factor @xmath84 and so were constrained to be less than @xmath103 . in section 3.1",
    "we consider the special case of @xmath20 , while section 3.2 presents results for the general case of @xmath19 .      for @xmath20",
    "our potential is identical to those considered in @xcite . we improve those analyses on two accounts :    * we have considered extra scattering channels which leads to one more eigenvalue constraint , @xmath98 , as explained in section 2 . * when finding the allowed parameter space of higgs masses we simultaneously impose all the eigenvalue constraints . in @xcite",
    "only the condition @xmath104 was applied when deriving mass bounds .    in order to obtain the upper bounds on the higgs masses allowed by the unitarity constraints we vary all the higgs masses and mixing angles randomly over a very large parameter space .",
    "we confirm the result of @xcite which states that @xmath105 is comfortably the strongest individual eigenvalue constraint .",
    "however , the other eigenvalues impose important constraints on @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "if only @xmath104 is imposed we can reproduce the upper bounds on the higgs masses given in @xcite , in particular their main result of @xmath17 gev .",
    "when all eigenvalue bounds are applied simultaneously we find improved bounds on the higgs masses , particularly for @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "we note that the new eigenvalue constraint @xmath106 ( eq.2.9 ) plays a crucial role in determining the upper bound on @xmath100 .",
    "we write in table.1 our bounds ( aan ) and those of @xcite , denoted by kkt .",
    "@xmath0 & @xmath107 + aan & 691 & 695 & 435 & 638 + kkt & 860 & 1220 & 410 & 700 +    note that the bounds given in table.1 are obtained for relatively small @xmath1 ( say @xmath108 ) . for large @xmath1",
    "the bound is stronger , although for the case of @xmath46 , @xmath44 and @xmath109 the @xmath1 dependence is rather gentle .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath1 dependence of the bound on @xmath0 which will covered in the section 3.2 .",
    "we now consider @xmath19 which corresponds to the inclusion of the term which softly breaks the discrete symmetry .",
    "such a term was neglected in the analyses of @xcite , and from perturbative constraints may take values @xmath110 @xcite . in the graphs which follow",
    "we do not impose the perturbative requirement @xmath111 for the remaining @xmath27 .",
    "imposing this condition only leads to minor changes in the numerical results which will be commented on when necessary .",
    "we plot in fig.1 the maximum value of @xmath0 against @xmath1 for increasing values of @xmath13 , imposing all the eigenvalue constraints simultaneously as done in section 3.1 . for the case of",
    "@xmath20 one finds a strong correlation , with larger @xmath1 requiring smaller @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath113 gev , which is the mass range already being probed by lepii .",
    "however , @xmath45 in the thdm with @xmath113 gev is not guaranteed to be found at lepii due to the suppression factor of @xmath114 for the main production process @xmath115 . for the case of @xmath20",
    "we find that values of @xmath116 are strongly disfavoured since they easily violate one of the unitarity constraints .",
    "if @xmath19 , fig.1 shows that for a given @xmath1 , the action of increasing @xmath13 allows larger maximum values of @xmath0 . for @xmath117 one finds a horizontal line at @xmath118 gev , showing that the upper bound has been increased for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , large ( @xmath119 ) values of @xmath1 are allowed if @xmath19 , in contrast to the case of @xmath20 .",
    "for example , @xmath120 comfortably permits values of @xmath121 .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite perturbative constraints on the @xmath27 also restrict the allowed values of @xmath1 in the thdm . using the condition in @xcite which requires @xmath111",
    ", we found that @xmath122 is strongly disfavoured .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the maximum mass values ( @xmath123 ) of all the higgs bosons as a function of @xmath13 . again",
    "all the higgs masses and mixing angles have been varied randomly .",
    "we see that @xmath20 corresponds to the values in table 1 , while for @xmath117 the upper bounds have been increased significantly . including the perturbative requirement would lower the bounds on @xmath101 and @xmath100 by @xmath124 gev .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath123 for @xmath125 and @xmath44 is not very pronounced , and the maximum mass value may be obtained for both small and large @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the relaxation of the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath19 would in principle allow the possibility of distinguishing between the discrete symmetry conserving and violating potentials .",
    "if @xmath45 is discovered and the measured values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 lie outside the rather constrained region for @xmath20 , this would signify @xmath19 and thus a soft breaking of the discrete symmetry .",
    "possibilities of measuring @xmath1 at high ",
    "energy @xmath126 colliders have been considered in the context of the mssm in @xcite .",
    "production and decay of @xmath47 and @xmath46 are particularly promising since the rates do not involve the mixing angle @xmath51 .",
    "much of the analysis of @xcite is also valid in the thdm .",
    "we have derived upper limits on the masses of the higgs bosons in the general two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) by requiring that unitarity is not violated in scalar scattering processes .",
    "we first considered the thdm scalar potential which is invariant under a discrete symmetry transformation and improved previous studies by including the complete set of scattering channels .",
    "stronger constraints on the higgs masses were derived .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath1 dependence of the upper bound on @xmath0 , with larger @xmath1 requiring a lighter @xmath45 e.g. @xmath112 implies @xmath113 gev .",
    "we then showed that the presence of the discrete symmetry breaking term parametrized by @xmath13 may significantly weaken the upper bounds on the masses .",
    "in particular , the aforementioned correlation between @xmath1 and maximum @xmath0 is relaxed .",
    "it was suggested that a measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath0 may allow discrimination between the two potentials .",
