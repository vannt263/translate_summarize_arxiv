    "it had been known for a long time that conformal quantum field theory exhibits in addition to the general spin - statistics theorem another more characteristic structural property which we will refer to as the `` anomalous dimension - central phase '' connection .",
    "it relates the anomalous scale dimension of fields modulo integers ( semi - integers in the case of fermion fields ) to the phase obtained by performing one complete timelike sweep around the compactified minkowski world @xcite and hence is analogous to the univalence superselection rule of the semi - integer spin which historically spells the beginning of the issue of superselection rules in the famous paper of wick , wightman and wigner @xcite . in the spin case one",
    "associates with a @xmath3 spatial rotation sweep the statistics phase @xmath4 of the spin - statistics connection @xcite and the question of whether there is a commutation relation behind the superselected coherent subspace corresponding to each phase factor of the timelike sweep poses itself naturally .",
    "the word `` central '' here refers to the center @xmath5(@xmath6 ) of the infinite sheeted covering group @xmath6 which has one abelian generator @xmath5 for spacetime dimensions @xmath7 in chiral conformal theories the sweep is lightlike and the spin and its timelike analogue coalesce , whereas in higher dimensions there is the problem of consistency with the well known dhr superselection theories of internal symmetries based on spacelike commutativity .",
    "it is our aim to show that the analogy is deeper than expected at first sight , namely the statistics aspect of the spin has an algebraic counterpart in form of a timelike braid group (  plektonic  ) commutation relation . here",
    "the notion of global causality in the covering of the compactified minkowski spacetime is important because it was on the basis of this concept that the `` einstein causality paradox '' @xcite was solved @xcite .",
    "the conformal decomposition theory resulted from the attempt to avoid the covering formalism ( which is not natural from a particle physics viewpoint ) and to deal instead with projected fields which behave like sections over compactified minkowski spacetime rather than globally causal fields on the covering . whereas the latter are wightman fields , the former are not since they carry with them a source and a range projector , and hence are similar to the exchange algebra fields of chiral theories @xcite .",
    "as in the chiral case the spectrum of anomalous dimensions ( possibly modulo a common abelian contribution ) is determined in terms of the admissable braid group representations .",
    "the chiral observables on @xmath8 correspond to conformal observables on compactified minkowski space @xmath9 . for the latter one",
    "has space- and timelike commutativity ( validity of huygens principle ) , in fact this distinction and the notion of causality altogether becomes meaningless and only lightlike distances have an invariant meaning .    in d=1",
    "+ 1 dimensions one has accumulated a good understanding of conformal theories and in particular of their associated superselected charge structure .",
    "one knows that they can be decomposed into the @xmath10 chiral light cone components .",
    "there is a systematic way to classify localizable representation of chiral observable algebras ( at least in principle ) and one finds charge - carrying fields which obey a lightlike exchange algebra @xcite@xcite in which those new objects satisfy braid group commutation relations either of the abelian kind ( anyonic ) or with plektonic ( which includes the nonabelian case ) r - matrices with quantized statistical phases .",
    "since the latter determine the spectrum of anomalous dimensions ( or spectrum of `` twists''= scale dimension minus spin ) modulo integers@xmath11 one has a theory of anomalous dimension as soon as one knows how to classify physically admissable representations of the infinite braid group or more precisely the ribbon braid group @xmath12 .",
    "the classification of the latter is done by the method of tracial states on @xmath13 which follow a combinatorial version of the field theoretic cluster decomposition property , the so - called markov property @xcite@xcite .",
    "this method was originally invented in the early 70@xmath14by doplicher haag and roberts ( dhr ) in order to classify the admissable permutation group statistics which is associated with the algebraic superselection theory of compactly localized charges in @xmath15 @xcite in a formulation without field multiplets .",
    "in subfactor theory @xcite this method was independently discovered in a vastly more general context and called it very appropriately the method of `` markov traces '' ( due to vaughn jones ) which in turn was gratefully re - adopted by the physicists .",
    "the name markov in this context reveals a lot about the conceptual scope of this theory because markov junior refers to the russian mathematician who made important contribution to the early study of the braid group , but at the same time one is invited to think about markov senior the probabilist since , while for a physicist the property of this tracial state ( which then allowed its iterative determination ) was a discrete version of the field theoretic cluster decomposition property , to a mathematician this procedure was more reminiscent of a discrete stochastic process .",
    "a field theoretic version of the classification of admissable braid group representations based on the markov trace formalism can be found in @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite    the reader will notice that in our enumeration of achievements in chiral theories we have omitted the better known representation theory of specific algebras as the energy - momentum tensor algebra or current algebras .",
    "this is not to ignore their important role in the modern development of chiral theories but rather a result of the fact that they have no direct counterpart in higher dimensions .",
    "so if we want to use chiral theory as a theoretical laboratory for higher dimensional conformal field theories we are forced to de - emphasized those aspects and highlight instead others , as space- and time - like commutation structures which are independent on spacetime dimensions .",
    "the weak point of the present approach to higher dimensional conformal theories is of course the total lack of nontrivial examples i.e. of higher dimensional conformal models with anomalous scaling dimensions .",
    "as already mentioned the new timelike superselection structure can unfortunately not be illustrated by the representation theory of any known algebra ( unlike chiral theory ) and it is also not possible to explore this timelike region by lagrangian methods ( which tend to favor the euclidean or spacelike regions ) .",
    "there is of course the folklore that the only lagrangian conformal 4-dimenional theories are a special kind of supersymmetric yang - mills theories which , if it could be made more rigorous in a clearer conceptional setting ( less computational recipes , more physical principles ) would be a remarkable observation .",
    "the present non - lagrangian approach suggests another picture : instead of a scarceness of models one should expect a similar wealth as in the case of nonperturbative chiral theories .",
    "i think that in the near future one will have new concepts and methods for their construction from timelike braid group data .",
    "more remarks can be found at the end .    in lack of illustrative examples which could show that the present requirements allow for nontrivial realizations , we are limited to consistency checks .",
    "the main new problem which was absent in the chiral case is the consistency of timelike braiding with spacelike locality i.e. one has to show that the new timelike plektonic structure is in harmony with the standard boson / fermion local commutation relations for the spacelike region",
    ". this will be the subject of the third section .",
    "the next section contains a review of the geometric setting of conformal symmetry .",
    "although most of these results are known since the 70s , we find it convenient for setting notation and concepts to present an updated version .",
    "the isomorphism of conformal field theory with qft in 5-dim .",
    "anti de sitter spacetime belongs logically ( though not historically ) to that section which deals with issues of compactification , covering and global causality .",
    "some comments on the relation of conformal qft and particle physics are in order . in most of the recent literature standard notions of particle physics as particles and scattering theory",
    "have been used in the conformal setting without qualifications . but a closer examination shows that conformal field theory is not a theory of interacting particles , at least not if these concepts are still used in a way which is not completely void of their original physical meaning .",
    "there are no discrete zero mass shells ( light cone delta functions in momentum space ) in an _ interacting _ dilation invariant theory and there is a fortiori no lsz s - matrix ( the asymptotic lsz limits in fact vanish ) .",
    "any kind of interaction dissolves immediately the zero mass shell into the continuum with a continuous mass distribution of enhanced weight at @xmath16 .",
    "there remains of course the interesting question of what kind of residual particle physics information one can extract from the scale invariant limit of a massive particle theory . for a discussion of this and related points",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the structural problems of conformal qft to which we draw our attention in the sequel do not depend on particle interpretations .",
    "since massless particles in a conformal theory can not interact @xcite , the physically interesting interacting fields in a conformal theory are those with anomalous dimension . whereas conformal free fields are commutative in the huygens sense of time- and spacelike commutativity ( huygens principle in wave optics transposed into the setting of local quantum physics )",
    ", conformal interactions lead to  reverberations@xmath17 inside the light cone which are in correspondence with the appearance of anomalous dimension and produce a paradoxical violation @xcite of einstein causality if one uses the standard description of minkowski space and allows `` big '' special conformal transformations to act on spacelike vanishing commutators with the usual transformation rules .",
    "hence it was of interest to investigate the global spacetime interpretation of such fields in more detail in order to remove the paradox . for aspects of global localization in interacting conformal field theories",
    "one needs to introduce the covering of the conformally compactified minkowski space with its nontrivial topology .",
    "this is a well - studied old subject @xcite@xcite@xcite , which led to an important global decomposition theory which , after lying dormant for a number of years ( when gauge theories took the center of the stage ) , @xciteobtained an unexpected fresh push in the special case of d=1 + 1 @xcite where conforms observables decompose ( similar to free fields ) additively in to the two light cone components .",
    "the latter act on a tensor - factorized hilbert space whereas charge - carrying fields act on a tensor product of extended superselected hilbert spaces .",
    "the fastest way to obtain a first glance at the formalism and physical use of the conformal covering space is to notice that the wigner representation theory for the poincar group for zero mass particles allows an extension to the conformal symmetry ( without extending the hilbert space and the degree of freedoms ) : poincar group @xmath18 . besides scale transformations",
    ", this larger symmetry also incorporates the fractional transformations ( proper conformal transformations ) @xmath19 the conformal reflection @xmath20 itself is not a moebius transformation , but in free field theories it is known to be implemented by a unitary transformation @xcite . for fixed x and small b the formula ( [ sc ] )",
    "is well defined , but globally it mixes finite spacetime points with infinity and hence requires a more precise definition ( in particular in view of the positivity energy - momentum spectral properties ) in its action on quantum fields .    as preparatory step for the quantum field theory concepts one has to achieve a geometric compactification .",
    "this starts most conveniently from a linear representation of the conformal group so(d,2 ) in 6-dimensional auxiliary space @xmath21 ( i.e. without field theoretic significance ) with two negative ( time - like ) signatures @xmath22 and restricts this representation to the ( d+1)-dimensional forward light cone @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the d - dimensional minkowski length square .",
    "the compactified minkowski space is obtained by adopting a projective point of view ( stereographic projection ) @xmath25 it is then easy to verify that the linear transformation which keep the last two components invariant consist of the lorentz group and those transformations which only transform the last two coordinates yield the scaling formula @xmath26 leading to @xmath27 the remaining transformations , namely the translations and the fractional proper conformal transformations , are obtained by composing rotations in the @xmath28-@xmath29 and boosts in the @xmath30-@xmath31 planes .",
    "the so obtained spacetime is most suitably parametrized in terms of a `` conformal time '' @xmath32@xmath33 so that the conformally compactified minkowski space is a piece of a multi - dimensional cylinder carved out between two d-1 dimensional boundaries which lie symmetrically around @xmath34 where they touch each other @xcite ( fig.1 below ) .",
    "if one cuts the cylinder wall this region @xmath35 looks like a double cone subtended by two points at infinity @xmath36 @xmath37 the boundary region @xmath38 consists precisely of all points which are past / future light like from @xmath39 ( the light rays on the cylinder are continuous lines starting from @xmath40 and ending at @xmath41 which are points to be identified on @xmath9 ) . in this way",
    "the cylinder is equipped with a tiling into infinitely many ordinary minkowski spaces .",
    "@xmath42 whereas matter in @xmath9 is subject to the quantum version of the huygens principle namely observables commute if the light ray subtended by one localization region can not reach the other , the covering @xmath43 comes with a global causality structure .",
    "the relevance of this covering space for the notion of relativistic causality was first pointed out first by i. segal @xcite and the above parametrization as well as many other contributions which became standard in conformal qft appeared for the first time in the work of luescher and mack @xcite .",
    "formally this framework solves the `` einstein causality paradox of conformal quantum field theory '' @xcite which originated from `` would be '' conformal models ( locally conformal invariant ) of quantum field theory as e.g. the massless thirring model which violates huygens principle .",
    "the naive reason for this apparent violation turned out to be that there exist continuous curves of special conformal transformations which lead from timelike separations with one point at the origin via the lightlike infinity to spacelike separation .",
    "this obviously generates a contradiction with the locality structure of the thirring model whose timelike anti - commutator unlike the spacelike one does not vanish .",
    "the covering structure formally solves this causality paradox by emphasizing that in fact there are no covering transformation which violate global causality , a paradox only arises if points become projected out of @xmath43 into @xmath44 in other words , one must keep track of the global path which remains space / time- like and not just its end points . if one depicts as before the covering space as a cylinder ( fig.1 below )",
    ", then it contains infinitely many copies of the original minkowski space which appear in the projection to ( @xmath45 subspace as a finite rhomboid region @xcite .    using the above parametrization in terms of @xmath46 and the `` conformal time '' @xmath47 one",
    "can immediately globalize the notion of time like distance and one finds the following causality structure ( @xcite@xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 now denotes the spacelike/@xmath50timelike separation in the global sense .",
    "since it is expressed in terms of the difference of two coordinates on the light cone in the 6-dim .",
    "ambient spacetime , a conformal transformation which is linear in the @xmath51-variables leaves it invariant . for the description of the dirac - weyl compactified minkowski space the use of the following simpler parametrization close to standard minkowski coordinates is more convenient @xmath52 similarly one may use the quadratic polynomial @xmath53 appearing in the denominator ( and the jacobian ) of the special conformal transformations in order to decide whether two points are globally timelike / spacelike ( connectable by timelike / spacelike geodesics ) without using ( [ glob ] ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "the formulation in terms of conformal covering space would be useful if the world ( including laboratories of experimentalists ) would also be conformal , which certainly is not the case .",
    "therefore it is helpful to know that there is a way of re - phrasing the physical content of local fields ( which violate the huygens principle and instead exhibit the phenomenon of `` reverberation ''",
    "@xcite inside the forward light cone ) in the minkowski world @xmath54 of ordinary particle physics without running into the trap of the causality paradox of the previous section ; in this way the use of the above @xmath55- parametrization would loose some of its importance and this may be considered as an alternative to the lscher - mack approach on covering space .",
    "this was first achieved in a joint paper involving one of the present authors @xcite whose main point was that the global causality structure could be encoded into a global decomposition theory of fields with respect to the center of the conformal covering ( conformal block decomposition ) .",
    "local fields , although behaving apparently irreducibly under infinitesimal conformal transformations , transform in general reducibly under the action of the global center of the covering @xmath56 this reduction was precisely the motivation in for the global decomposition theory of conformal fields in @xcite . @xmath57",
    "these component fields behave analogous to trivializing sections in a fibre bundle ; the only memory of their origin from an operator on covering space is their quasiperiodicity @xmath58 ^{\\delta -\\zeta } \\left [ \\sigma _ { -}(b , x)\\right ] ^{\\zeta } } % f_{\\delta } ( x)_{\\alpha , \\beta } \\\\ \\zeta & = & \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta _ { f}+\\theta _ { \\beta } -\\theta _ { \\alpha } )   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line is the transformation law of special conformal transformation of the components of an operator @xmath59 with scale dimension @xmath60 sandwiched between superselected subspaces @xmath61 anf @xmath62 using the explicit form of the conformal 3-point function it is easy to see that phases are uniquely given in terms of the scaling dimensions @xmath63 which occur in the conformal model @xcite .",
    "@xmath64 a central projector projects onto the subspace of all vectors which have the same scaling phase i.e. onto a conformal block associated with the center , so the labelling refers to ( in case of bosons ) the anomalous dimensions @xmath65 these subspaces of operators are bigger than the chiral blocks , since the anomalous dimension e.g. does not distinguish between with charged fields and their anti - fields which carry the conjugate charge .",
    "having understood the physical interpretation of the central decomposition does not yet mean that we have a theory of the spectrum of admissable anomalous dimensions ( critical indices ) in higher dimensional conformal theories , but the close analogy to chiral theories gives sufficient incentive to look for such a theory .",
    "this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "the prize one has to pay for this return to the realm of particle physics on @xmath54 in terms of component fields ( [ comp ] ) is that these projected fields are not wightman fields .",
    "they depend on a source and range projector and if applied to a vector the source projector has to match the hilbert space i.e. @xmath66 annihilates the vacuum if @xmath67 is not the projector onto the vacuum sector .",
    "this is very different from the behavior of the original @xmath59 which , in case it was localized in a region with a nontrivial spacelike complement , can never annihilate the vacuum .",
    "this kind of projected fields are well known from the exchange algebra formalism of chiral qft @xcite but they appear in a rudimentary form already in @xcite .    inside",
    "two and 3-point functions the projectors are unique and may be omitted but for @xmath68 there are several projected n - point functions and therefore they are needed .",
    "structural properties of the real time formulation as this timelike decomposition formula remain totally hidden in the euclidean formulation .",
    "they lead to cuts with multi - valuedness in an analyticity region which is beyond the standard bhw @xcite extended permuted tube region ( see next section ) of standard poincar invariant theories . as in the chiral case",
    "one defines conformal observable fields as those which commute with the center generator @xmath5 and , as a consequence are free of these cuts i.e. have meromorphic ( rational ) correlation functions on @xmath9 and its complex extensions as it is well known from the chiral conformal observables ( where the terminology `` holomorphic '' was unfortunately attributed to the observable fields instead of referring to a particular state their ground state correlation functions only )    the structure of the center in chiral conformal field theories is determined by the discrete spectrum of the rotation operators for the compactified @xmath69lightrays @xmath70 where the right hand side is the standard virasoro algebra notation .",
    "it is well - known that this operator shares with the light ray translations @xmath71 the positivity of its spectrum .",
    "this becomes in fact obvious if one represents it in terms of @xmath72@xmath73 where @xmath74 is the representer of the chiral conformal reflection @xmath75 ( in linear lightray coordinates @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 is the generator of the fractional special conformal transformation ( [ sc ] ) .",
    "however the two - dimensional inversion does not factorize since the chiral inversion rewritten in terms of 2-dim .",
    "vector notation corresponds to @xmath78 the `` wrong '' sign in the spatial part can be corrected by a parity transformation @xmath79 which mixes the two chiral components . in defining an object which transforms as a vector",
    "this has to be taken in consideration @xmath80    the vector formula ( [ vec ] ) is valid in any dimension i.e. does not require light ray factorization .",
    "it leads to a family of operators with discrete spectrum @xmath81 which are dependent on a timelike vector @xmath82 as in the chiral case one only needs to add to the poincar+scale transformations the ( timelike ) conformal rotation @xmath83 the other components of @xmath84 are generated by the action of the lorentz group .    to understand the geometric action of @xmath85 it is helpful to depict the covering world @xmath43 with a copy of the minkowski world inside",

    "the pictures are closely related to those used by penrose , except that penrose does not use them for compactification since he is dealing with a conformal class of spacetime metrics and not with conformal invariant observable matter fulfilling the huygens principle .",
    "( 176,266 )    it is hard to resist mentioning that the d+2 dimensional setting for the compactification and subsequent covering of d - dimensional minkowski spacetime also lends itself to obtain a natural relation with the dd+1 dimensional @xmath91 ( anti de sitter ) spacetime by taking instead of the surface of the light cone a hyperbolic region inside this light cone @xmath92 it is immediately clear that asymptotically this @xmath93 dimensional lorentzian noncompact manifold in the associated @xmath51-parametrization has a d - dimensional conformal boundary which in the above picture corresponds to the asymptotic coalescence of the @xmath94 with the light cone directions .",
    "this asymptotic pointlike relation can of course not be continued inside the @xmath94 spacetime , but the action of the same @xmath95 group on the two manifolds suggests a relation between d - dimensional conformal double cone ( conformal transforms of rindler wedge regions ) and d+1 dimensional wedge regions on @xmath94 i.e. between those regions which result from projecting d+2 dimensional wedges in the ambient space ( on which there is a transitive linear action of @xmath95 ) onto @xmath96 and @xmath97using the setting of algebraic qft , rehren @xcite converted this geometric relation into an isomorphism between algebraic quantum field theories where the principle objects are localized algebras and not their coordinatizations in terms of pointlike field generators .",
    "in fact as one naively expects the isomorphism negates a relation between pointlike field theories ( see below ) .",
    "although from a logical point of view the above observation on ads spacetime belongs naturally to the conformal compactification setting of the 70s where most of the above observations were made , history ( as almost always and in particular in this case ) did not follow logic .",
    "rather part of the isomorphism namely the mapping @xmath98 for the corresponding qfts was first observed by string theorist at the end of the 90 s @xcite in connection with their speculative ideas on quantum gravity .",
    "although the underlying idea was that the asymptotic map characterizes a unique ads theory once the conformal asymptote has been prescribed , it was rehren s construction which supplied a constructive mathematical proof for the full isomorphism and at the same time also highlighted the conceptual scope of ( field - coordinate - free ) local quantum physics .",
    "the isomorphism can be brought closer to the realm of particle physics if one highlights the above analogy between the hamiltonian @xmath99 and the conformal `` hamiltonian '' @xmath100 by asking the following question : is there a qft which maintains the symmetries but for which the conformal hamiltonian of the @xmath101 becomes the true hamiltonian ?",
    "the answer is unique , it is precisely the same @xmath94 theory of the rehren isomorphism which changes the physical interpretation and the spacetime affiliation , but not the group theoretical and algebraic net structure .",
    "the particle physics nature of this isomorphism can be further clarified by studying concrete examples e.g. the fate of free conformal / ads fields under this isomorphism .",
    "the result is rather interesting @xcite .",
    "a pointlike ads free fields has too many degrees of freedom with the result that its conformal image is a special `` generalized free field '' with a homogenous mass distribution which destroys the primitive causality i.e. the requirement that the algebraic data in a time slice ( in order to avoid short distance problems of spacelike surfaces ) which covers a compact spatial region fix the data in the `` causal shadow '' region ( the double cone shaped causal envelop ) . using rehren s graphical illustration @xcitewhich depicts conformal qft on a cylindrical boundary of the ads world , one sees that there are more and more degrees of freedom from the inside of ads entering the causal shadow as one moves upward in time .",
    "vice versa if one starts from a free conformal theory than the ads image can not sustain pointlike fields but only configurations which are delocalized ( and hence diluted ) in one direction as some kind of nielsen - olsen string i.e. the memory from its d - dimensional pointlike origin is stored in the ads image .",
    "this means in practical terms that the nice idea to start with a lagrangian ads theory end re - process them with the witten prescription to the conformal side in order to enrich the set of conformal models does not work .",
    "one obtains conformal theories in this way but they are unphysical , a fact which remains concealed in the euclidean formulation .",
    "this also affects the conjectures string theory ",
    "sym relation to the extend that it relies on a relation between @xmath1 and conformal sym lagrangian theories .",
    "the algebraic isomorphism itself is not affected limited by these deficiencies in pointlike ( lagrangian ) relations and their remains the intellectually challenging problem of understanding the algebraic conformal decomposition theory and its dhr origin directly for qft on ads .",
    "just because the isomorphism changes the interpretation , it is by no means obvious without looking carefully at details , what the observations in this article mean in a ads spacetime .",
    "since the spectrum of anomalous dimensions becomes encoded into the spectrum of a hamiltonian one even could be optimistic and hope for certain simplifications on the ads side .",
    "a rather trivial and unfortunately atypical case is @xmath102 whose bona fide hamiltonian is the virasoro @xmath103 and in fact it is the only system with a maximal sl(2,r ) symmetry having that compact ( discrete spectrum ) opaerator as its hamiltonian .",
    "the above analogies between the d=1 + 1 case and the higher dimensional conformal field theory should however not lead one into overlooking a remarkable difference . already on a purely classical level",
    "the characteristic value problem for the free wave equation is totally different from either its massive counterpart or from the d2 case . whereas in the latter cases the data on one lightray or lightfront is complete , the zero mass d=1 + 1 case needs both the lightray data in order to determine the d=1 + 1 theory . in the qft",
    "the manifestation of this is the tensor factorization into the chiral degrees of freedom which amounts to a doubling of degrees of freedom . in the next section",
    "we will see that this also leads to an exceptional behavior in the timelike huygens structure and the associated timelike braid group structure .",
    "so the chirally factorizing d=1 + 1 situation is a guide in certain higher dimensional aspects and stands in interesting contrast to others .",
    "in the previous section we have emphasized certain analogies between the timelike algebraic structure in higher dimensional and chiral conformal theories . for the latter",
    "the decomposition theory has a more fundamental explanation in terms of a local plektonic superselection structure .",
    "this in particular means that the components appearing in ( [ comp ] ) permit a local refinement ; they can be further reduces into dhr localized charge sectors of an observable local algebra which lives on @xmath8 and which in concrete models is generated by the energy momentum tensor , current algebras , w - algebras etc .",
    "the commutation structure of charge - carrying chiral fields obtained by the dhr method is an exchange algebra    @xmath104g_{\\alpha , \\beta ^{\\prime } } ( y)f_{\\beta ^{\\prime } , \\gamma } ( x),\\,\\,x > y   \\label{time } \\\\",

    "the localization is always meant relative to the observables @xcite .",
    "the artin relations are a consequence of the associativity of this algebra . here",
    "the indices @xmath106 refers to projectors on irreducible dhr representation spaces .",
    "although the latter are a refinement of the projectors appearing in the center @xmath5 , we will for simplicity in writing maintain the same notation .",
    "the validity of such an exchange algebra structure would supply a natural local explanation for the center superselection rules .",
    "we will therefore postulate this structure for the timelike region in higher dimensional conformal theories ( where now @xmath49 to @xmath107timelike ordering ) and , in lack of concrete examples , test its consistency .",
    "it is reasonable to start with consistency checks in the standard wightman framework of pointlike covariant fields .",
    "the most powerful tool of wightman s formulation is provided by the analytic properties of correlation functions .",
    "it is well known that the complexified lorentz group may be used to extend the tube analyticity associated with the physical positive energy - momentum spectrum .",
    "the famous bhw theorem @xcite insures that this extension remains univalued in a new complex domain and the jost theorem characterizes its real points .",
    "finally spacelike locality links the various permutations of the position field operators within the correlation function to one permutation ( anti)symmetric analytic master function which is still univalued .",
    "the various correlation functions on the physical boundary with different operator ordering can be obtained by different temporal @xmath108 prescriptions descending to the real boundary from within the tube .    complexifying the scale transformations , the conformal correlations can be extended into a still bigger analyticity region which even incorporates `` timelike jost points '' . but trying to find a univalued master function which links the various orders together fails in the presence of fields with anomalous dimensions and only works for observable fields which are local fields on the compactification @xmath109 the latter are the analogs of chiral observables , except that apart from ( composite ) free fields one does not have algebraic examples since virasoro- and kac - moody algebras do not exist in higher dimensions .",
    "the timelike braid group structure suggest that the role of the permutation group in the analytic extension from timelike points should be replaced by the braid group .",
    "the resulting ramification takes place in a region which is obtained analytic extension by the complex dilation group , which leaves the old univalued bhw region free of branch cuts .",
    "therefore the timelike braid structure is consistent with the bhw analyticity structure .",
    "let us look at other arguments which test the consistency of the old spacelike locality with the new timelike localization structure because the problem of coexistence of these two regions is the main difference to the chiral case .",
    "this significant difference even remains if one glues together the two chiralities to a 2-dimensional conformal theory .",
    "as already mentioned before , it has its origin already in the classical wave propagation theory one needs two sets of characteristic light ray data to e.g. determine the amplitudes in a wedge region whereas for any higher dimensional theory ( and even massive d=1 + 1 propagation ) one light front is enough .",
    "a plektonic charge structure which is only visible in the timelike region would immediately explain the appearance of a nontrivial timelike center and the spectrum of anomalous dimension .",
    "it would sort of `` kinematize '' conformal interactions and reveal conformal qfts as basically free theories if it would not be for that part of interaction which sustains the timelike plektonic structure .",
    "of course the situation trivializes if the theory has no anomalous dimensions and nontrivial components .",
    "analogous to @xcite ( remarks at end of section v.4 ) we conjecture that this characterizes interaction free conformal theories which are generated by free fields .",
    "what makes this issue somewhat complicated is the fact that contrary to chiral theories we do not have a single nontrivial example because this issue is neither approachable from the representation theory of known infinite dimensional lie - algebras nor from the formal euclidean functional integral method .",
    "the remaining strategy is to show structural consistency of the spacelike local- with the conjectured timelike plektonic- structure and to find a new construction method ( non energy - momentum tensor- or current- algebra based , non - lagrangian ) .",
    "here we are mainly be concerned with consistency arguments and in the following we will comment how local / plektonic on - vacuum relations between two fields can be commuted through to a generic position .",
    "assume for simplicity , as we have already tacitly done in our decomposition formulas before , that we are in a `` minimalistic '' situation ( similar to minimal models or w - algebras in the chiral setting ) where the field theory has no internal symmetry group .",
    "actually the whole discussion can be carried out in the presence of nontrivial inner symmetries , but the additional complications do not essentially alter the following consistency considerations .",
    "so we assume that the fields can be given `` timelike '' charge indices @xmath110 and their conjugates @xmath111 resulting from projectors on charge spaces so that the decomposition is as in the chiral case where the charge projectors with the same phase factors @xmath112 constitute a refinement of a central projector .",
    "clearly @xmath113 and its conjugate @xmath114 contribute tu the same central projector .",
    "in fact we may take over a substantial part of the formalism and concepts of @xcite . if one replaces the chiral translation+dilation augmented by the circular rotation generator @xmath103 by the spacetime symmetry group which leaves the timelike infinite point fixed ( poincar+dilations ) augmented by the generator of conformal time @xmath100 instead of the chiral @xmath115 one would of course also have to change the title of the old paper from `` einstein causality and artin braids '' to `` huygens causality and artin braids '' referring to the timelike ordering for which the conformal observables fulfill the huygens principle of vanishing commutators .",

    "these composites applied to the vacuum form a dense set in the respective charge sector ] and hence the on - vacuum formula is a consequence of the structure of 3-point functions .",
    "the spacelike local commutativity off - vacuum is consistent with that on - vacuum since for @xmath121 timelike with respect to a spacelike pair @xmath122 we have ( here @xmath123 denote the superselected charges of the participating operators ) @xmath124 and therefore the off - vacuum vanishing of the @xmath59-@xmath125 commutator is consistent with the on - vacuum vanishing of this commutator if there holds a certain relation between @xmath126 and @xmath127 which is identically fulfilled for @xmath128 .",
    "similarly one does not run into inconsistencies if one tries to obtain a timelike off - vacuum @xmath59-@xmath125 situation from the on - vacuum placement by commuting through a @xmath99 which is spacelike to the timelike @xmath59-@xmath125 pair @xmath129 where in the second line we commuted @xmath59 through @xmath125 _ before _ trying to bring both to the vacuum .",
    "since their is no rule to commute the @xmath130 with @xmath131 for @xmath132 there is no way to get to the same @xmath133 order as in the first line and hence no consistency relation is to be checked .",
    "the absence of rules for spacelike commutations for projected fields protects the formalism to run into inconsistencies . if components for spacelike distances would commute than they belong to the vacuum .",

    "one possible point of departure for the algebraic approach would be to start from a doplicher - roberts field net @xmath142 on @xmath54 and use its assumed local conformal invariance in order to construct a unique extension @xmath143 on the covering @xmath144 this has been done in the work @xcite where it was also shown that extended net fulfills the important property of haag duality which in the bosonic case is a maximalization of causality @xmath145 where we have used the standard notation of aqft : a dash on the algebra means the von neumann commutant in the hilbert space of the operator algebra , whereas on the localization region @xmath86 ( double cone , or any conformal transform thereof ) it means spacelike complement in the global sense of @xmath144 in order to obtain information about a timelike braid group structure we need to identify an observable subnet @xmath146 on @xmath54 consisting of operators which commute with @xmath5 and is haag dual for timelike distances such that the restriction of the field net to the observable net decomposes into irreducible representations of the latter which obey braid group fusion laws . the projectors onto those irreducible subspaces would than be the desired refinements of the central @xmath5 projectors by which one obtains the @xmath66 exchange algebra operators .",
    "a prerequisite for this idea to work would be the existence of an autonomous timelike haag dual net which is sufficiently nonlocal in the spacelike sense i.e. sufficiently different from a spacelike haag dual net .",
    "this is necessary in order to obtain sectors which are different from those of the spacelike based dhr theory .",
    "a theory of observables @xmath146 on the compactification @xmath9 is automatically haag dual , but the localization of the commutant of a double cone would consist of a spacelike and timelike part @xcite .",
    "we would need a dualization which involves only the timelike complement in @xmath54 of double cones and which should be sufficiently nonlocal with respect to a conformal dhr dualization based on double cone algebras defined in terms of intersections of infinitely many wedges .",
    "algebraically the haag dual net on @xmath9 results from conformal transformations from the wedge algebra , whereas the double cones of the timelike dual net are obtained from intersections of the forward- with the shifted backward light cone algebra in @xmath44    from a pointlike field point of view the difference in these algebras is related to the way in which smeared fields are used to generate algebra .",
    "if they are used on @xmath54 then the net at infinity is diluted because the test functions vanish on @xmath147 and in order to re - establish the duality balance on has to make the algebras in the net bigger which do not contain points at infinity .",
    "this and the ensuing loss of spacelike commutativity of these algebras has been studied in @xcite . a detailed investigation of `` cutting holes '' into the circle of chiral nets and then producing new conformal nets from the haag dualization of the punctured nets can be found in @xcite .",
    "although such studies of chiral theories can not answer the above consistency problems in higher dimensional theories , they do supply valuable concepts and mathematical methods for further studies .",
    "as in many other areas of field theory , consistency problems find their satisfactory solutions only through mathematically controllable model constructions and the structural analysis is only a preparatory step in the classification and construction of models outside the standard lagrangian realm .",
    "its main purpose is to prepare our intuition in an area where it is presently underdeveloped or beset by prejudices .",
    "thinking of what could be the right setting for such constructions , only one idea seems to offer sufficient conceptual depth and mathematical power .",
    "this the modular localization approach based on the tomita - takesaki modular theory and using new physical concepts as `` polarization - free generators '' of wedge algebras .",
    "there are two ways of using that theory and both are independent of spacetime dimensions @xcite@xcite , although special situations in low dimensions greately favor their analytical control .    one approach is based on the fact that the s - matrix is a relative modular invariant of wedge algebras and is behind the bootstrap - formfactor constructions in d=1 + 1 factorizing models .",
    "conformal theories do not have an s - matrix , but there are indications that their tcp operators ( @xmath148modular conjugations for the modular theory of the forward light cone algebra ) can be related to a simpler reference situation by generalized `` twist operators '' which contain the braid information .",
    "this idea should be first tested for chiral theories since even there exists up to date no systematic method to construct a model associated with a given plektonic superselection structure . in contradistinction to the standard methods which start from concrete observable algebras ( virasoro- , current- w - algebras ) and introduce the charge - carrying fields as intertwiners between the irreducible representations , the modular method aims directly at the charged fields .",
    "it is analogous to the wigner poincar group representation approach to free fields where the charged fields came first and the group invariant observable algebras ( which are more complicated since they involve composite fields ) were later introduces only for purposes of a better structural understanding .",
    "the modular program is in a certain sense a continuation of the wigner approach in the presence of interactions .",
    "presently 4-dimensional conformal theories are very scarce and in fact do not yet exist on the same conceptual and mathematical level as chiral models .",
    "perturbative ideas about their construction have not yet given satisfactory results .",
    "one idea which was mentioned in the second section as not leading to physically viable conformal theories was the use of perturbative lagrangian ads models in the @xmath1-@xmath2 connection .",
    "recently there have also been direct attempts to obtain nontrivial conformal theories within the family of perturbatively renormalizable supersymmetric yang - mills models with vanishing callan - symanzik @xmath149-function ( which is a necessary condition for conformal invariance in perturbation theory ) @xcite .",
    "there are many lowest order perturbative calculations for gauge invariant quantities ( often involving additional approximations ) , but they presently did not reach a level where they could be used for a test with the braiding ideas in this paper . even the conjectures on the existence of certain `` protected '' quantities are not very clear .",
    "protected objects by definition do not receive any contributions from the interaction i.e. they retain their zero order free field values . a chiral illustration of a protected quantity would be a nontrivial chiral theory which has an energy momentum tensor with the free field value c=1 of which there exist plenty .",
    "`` nontrivial '' here simply means that there are other unprotected quantities in the model .",
    "what is conceivable is a protection of an entire subalgebra as in this analogy .",
    "a protection of only certain correlation functions on the other hand ( say the two - or three - point normalization constant of a certain operator ) which does not follow a ( supersymmetric ) charge rule which characterizes a subalgebra of operators is hardly reconcilable with one s understanding of the omnipresence vacuum polarization in interacting qft .",
    "so the question of the quality of arguments about protection remains open .",
    "the crucial question for a future comparison with the timelike braid group structure is whether the perturbation theory can be pushed far enough so that one can extract anomalous dimensions .",
    "if it works it is probably limited to models with an abelian braid group phase , which in the analogy to chiral models would mean something analogous to the massless thirring model but not to e.g. a minimal model without a coupling deformation parameter .",
    "since it is not unrealistic to expect that the first conceptually and mathematically controllable 4-dimensional nontrivial models will be conformal ( because they stay close to free field theories without being identical to them ) , this line of research has a certain urgency and importance for the future of qft .",
    "another fascinating but at the same time very speculative idea which emerges from the present setting on the structure of higher dimensional conformal theories is the suggestion that there may be charge superselection rules and inner symmetries which do not respect the inner / spacetime factorization pattern of the coleman - mandula theorem ( and a fortiori not its prerequisites ) even after adjusting the prerequisites in order to incorporate supersymmetry",
    ". braided charges and their fusions certainly have a very different structure than multiplets of fields on which compact group act .",
    "in fact a timelike braided structure would inexorably remain linked with spacetime and dynamics .",
    "we have gotten so much used to think in terms of nonabelian symmetry groups that it is helpful to remind oneself from time to time that there actually does not exist a single exact nonabelian continuous flavor symmetry in nature .",
    "so to look for explanations of the observed regularities outside group theory may not be that absurd as it appears at first sight .",
    "but the idea that the observed regularities may be remnants of timelike braidings remains a farfetched wild speculation as long as there is no understanding of how conformal theories can be naturally related to particle models in a more controllable way than assigning to them a short distance universality class ..    _ acknowledgements _ : i am indebted to karl - henning rehren for making some suggestions based on an earlier smaller and still somewhat opaque version .",
    "i thank lucio fassarel for some mathematical suggestion and for helping me with the pictures .",
    "i owe also thanks to francesco toppan for discussions which were helpful in the formulation .",
    "last not least i would like to thank detlev buchholz for an interesting exchange of emails on the issue of possible non - locality of timelike - defined double cone algebras . through this exchange of mails",
    "it became also clear to me that as a result of his familiarity with zero mass problems the possibility of a timelike braided structure was probably on his mind some time ago .",
