    "a quasi - exactly solvable model is one for which it is possible to solve the schrdinger equation exactly for a finite portion of the energy spectrum @xcite . in quantum chemistry ,",
    "a famous example of this is the hooke s law atom @xcite , which consists of a pair of electrons , repelling coulombically but trapped in a harmonic external potential .",

    "we have recently discovered @xcite that a pair electrons , repelling coulombically but constrained to remain on the surface of a @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath2 @xcite is also quasi - exactly solvable and we have called this system @xmath0-spherium .",

    "we have shown that the schrdinger equation for the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 states of @xmath0-spherium can be solved exactly for a countably infinite set of @xmath2 values and that the resulting wave functions are polynomials in the interelectronic distance @xmath6 .    in this article",

    "the opposite behavior is observed with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "futhermore , as @xmath2 ( or , equivalently , @xmath16 ) increases , the electrons tend to localize on opposite sides of the sphere due to the dominance of the coulomb interaction as the density decreases @xcite .",

    ", those with a cusp value of 1/4 @xcite are the _ natural and unnatural parity triplet states _ , and those with a cusp value of 1/6 @xcite , are the _ unnatural parity singlet states_.    in previous work @xcite , we have observed that the @xmath14 ground state and the first excited @xmath15 state of 3-spherium possess the same singlet ( 1/2 ) and triplet ( 1/4 ) cusp conditions as those for electrons moving in three - dimensional physical space and we have therefore argued that 3-spherium may be the most appropriate model for studying `` real '' atomic or molecular systems .",
    "this is supported by the similarity of the correlation energy @xmath41 of 3-spherium to that in other two - electron systems .",
    "indeed , it can be shown @xcite that , as @xmath42 , @xmath41 approaches @xmath43 , which is close to the corresponding values for the helium - like ions ( @xmath44 ) @xcite , the hooke s law atom ( @xmath45 ) @xcite , and two electrons in a ball ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "most of the higher angular momentum states of 3-spherium , possess the `` normal '' cusp values of 1/2 and 1/4 .",

    "the generalization to @xmath0 dimensions is straightforward .",

    "@xmath62 ( see table [ tab : summary ] ) , one can see that the hamiltonian of the @xmath13 , @xmath47 , @xmath63 and @xmath48 states for a given value of @xmath0 are respectively identical to those for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath12 , and @xmath64 states at @xmath65 .",
    "the transformation @xmath62 , preserves the parity of the states , but `` flips '' the spin configuration , thereby increasing by one unit the value of @xmath66 . in @xmath0-spherium , we note that the hamiltonians of the @xmath13 and @xmath64 states are identical .",

    "the corresponding exact solutions are polynomials in the interelectronic distance @xmath55 .    the cusp conditions ( up to third - order in the interelectronic distance ) , which are related to the behavior of the wave function at the electron - electron coalescence point , have been analyzed and classified according to the natural or unnatural parity of the state considered ."
