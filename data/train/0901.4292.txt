    "one - dimensional nonlinear maps play an important role in the development of the theory of chaos .",
    "their long - time behavior is different for different kinds of maps and , for dissipative dynamical systems , the phase space measure is not conserved : all trajectories approach a certain subset of the phase space called _ attractor_. the characterization of chaotic attractors is interesting and , as we shall see , a still open problem whenever the lyapunov exponent vanishes ( frequently referred to as _ weak chaos _ ) .",
    "the exploration of their special dynamical properties is , besides their simplicity and convenience for the development of theory of chaos , also motivated by the hope that the study of the possible limits of validity of the canonical statistical mechanics can benefit from the study of much simpler dynamical systems that are known to exhibit statistical - mechanical analogies @xcite .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional unimodal maps may depend of a single control parameter that determines the dynamical behavior of the map .",
    "they typically have only one attractor , which differs for different parameter values .",
    "this fact makes these maps to constitute paradigmatic models in the study of the emergence of complexity in dynamical systems .",
    "here we introduce and analyze a new universality class of one - dimensional unimodal dissipative maps .",
    "our initial scope is to test , through them , the applicability and usefulness of generalized dynamical indicators ( @xmath2-indices ) that emerge within nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite in order to establish a more complete classification of ( weak and strong ) chaotic systems .",

    "we are interested in studying these two properties on averages ( denoted as @xmath41 ) over the entire phase space of the maps ( @xmath42 ) instead of using the quickest - spreading special regions @xcite .",
    "this kind of averaging mimics gibbs approach to thermostatistical ensembles , and minimizes the role of fluctuations ( particularly large at the edge of chaos ) .",
    "the third property we are also interested in is the characterization of the probability density of sums of iterates of the map and , consequently , the possible applicability of a @xmath2-generalized central limit theorem ( clt ) to the iterates of _ deterministic _ dynamical systems .",
    "it has been shown in many one - dimensional unimodal maps that the sensitivity to initial conditions is given by the generalized functional expression @xcite ( called @xmath2-exponential function within the context of nonextensive statistical mechanics ) @xmath43^{1/(1-q)}\\equiv e_q^{\\lambda _ q t } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the temporal dependence of the discrepancy of two very close initial conditions at time @xmath45 , @xmath2 is a parameter ( for @xmath46 the expression recovers the standard exponential dependence @xmath47 ) , and @xmath48 is a generalized lyapunov coefficient ( when @xmath46 then @xmath49 and the lyapunov exponent is recovered ; when @xmath50 and @xmath51 the system is said to be weakly sensitive to the initial conditions ; when @xmath52 and @xmath53 it is said to be weakly insensitive ) .",

    "other methods ( e.g. , based on multifractality ) do exist for the calculation of @xmath2 , but we address here just these two ones .",
    "the estimation of the @xmath2-entropy production consists in dividing the phase space @xmath68 in @xmath69 ( typically @xmath70 ) equal cells , and putting @xmath71 randomly chosen initial conditions inside one of the @xmath69 cells .",
    "we accompany the spread of points within the phase space , and calculate @xmath72 from the set of occupancy probabilities @xmath73 .",
    "we repeat the operation many times ( typically @xmath74 for strong chaos , and @xmath75 for weak chaos ) , choosing different initial cells within which the @xmath76 initial conditions are chosen ( we usually use @xmath77 ) . finally , we average the entropies @xmath72 over the @xmath78 initial cells so that the proper value of the entropic parameter @xmath79 is the special value of @xmath2 which makes the averaged @xmath2-entropy @xmath80 production to be _",

    "the iterates of a deterministic dynamical system can never be completely independent , since they are generated by a deterministic algorithm .",
    "however , a central limit theorem ( ctl ) for _ deterministic _ dynamic systems can be proved @xcite when we consider a one - dimensional map , @xmath82 , with positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "more precisely , the well known clt assumption about the independence of @xmath83 identically distributed random variables is replaced by a weaker property that essentially means asymptotic statistical independence for large time difference .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution of the rescaled sum @xmath84 becomes a gaussian for the number of iterates @xmath85 , regarding the initial value @xmath86 as a random variable ( @xmath87 for strongly chaotic maps ) . here",
    "@xmath88 is a suitable smooth function with vanishing average which projects from the @xmath89-dimensional phase space to a @xmath90-dimensional subspace . in our case , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",

    ", we are interested here in studying the distribution of the rescaled sums of iterates ( [ distbnorm ] ) for the ( @xmath24,@xmath37)-logarithmic maps .",

    "the sum ( [ distbnorm ] ) must be evaluated for initial conditions located close to the space phase attractor .",

    "<S> we introduce a new universality class of one - dimensional unimodal dissipative maps . </S>",
    "<S> the new family , from now on referred to as the ( @xmath0)-_logarithmic map _ , corresponds to a generalization of the @xmath1-logistic map . the feigenbaum - like constants of these maps are determined . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently shown that the probability density of sums of iterates at the edge of chaos of the @xmath1-logistic map is numerically consistent with a @xmath2-gaussian , the distribution which , under appropriate constraints , optimizes the nonadditive entropy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the presently generalized maps to check whether they constitute a new universality class with regard to @xmath2-gaussian attractor distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the generalized @xmath2-entropy production per unit time on the new unimodal dissipative maps , both for strong and weak chaotic cases . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-sensitivity indices are obtained as well . </S>",
    "<S> our results are , like those for the @xmath1-logistic maps , numerically compatible with the @xmath2-generalization of a pesin - like identity for ensemble averages .    </S>",
