    "the study of galaxies at high redshifts has been revolutionized with the introduction of the hubble space telescope and the new generation of large ground - based telescopes .",
    "detecting and studying such systems at high redshift is essential to understanding how normal galaxies form and evolve .",
    "franx et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have recently reported the serendipitous discovery of a field galaxy at a redshift @xmath0 that has been gravitationally lensed into several arc components , including a highly magnified fold arc , by an intervening cluster of galaxies ( cl1358 + 62 ) at @xmath9 .",
    "franx et al .",
    "present hst imaging and keck spectroscopy of this highly - magnified lensed system .",
    "because of the redshift , the hst images at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) correspond to wavelengths of 1023  and 1375  in the rest frame of the background objects , and thereby sample only the far uv portion of the light emitted from these galaxies . in order to study these objects at wavelengths where nearby galaxies have been studied",
    ", we observed the brightest ( fold ) arc of the lensed galaxy at near infrared wavelengths using the w.m .",
    "keck telescope . in the discussion",
    "we adopt the same cosmological parameters as in franx , et al .",
    ", i.e. @xmath14 50 km / s / mpc and @xmath150.5 .",
    "the observations reported here were made in april 1997 in photometric conditions using the near infrared camera ( nirc ) at the f/25 forward cassegrain focus of the w.m .",
    "keck telescope .",
    "the instrument is described in detail by matthews and soifer ( 1994 ) .",
    "it has a 256@xmath16256 insb array with 0.15@xmath170.15@xmath18 pixels for a 38@xmath19 38@xmath18 field of view .",
    "sets of images centered on the brightest portion of the arc ( locations b to c , described by franx et al .",
    "1997 ) were obtained at 1.25@xmath1 m ( @xmath20 ) , 1.65@xmath1 m ( @xmath21 ) and 2.2@xmath1 m ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the broadband @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 images were made with total exposures of 1620 s per filter .",
    "in addition a set of images was taken in a 1.2% bandpass filter centered at a wavelength of 2.297 @xmath1 m ( rest wavelength 3881 ) , which contained the redshifted [ neiii ] 3869  line ) .",
    "the total exposure time at this wavelength was 2700 s. the imaging data were obtained in sets of 60 s exposures , where the center of the field was moved in a 3@xmath163 grid pattern 10@xmath23 on a side .",
    "the centers of successive grids were moved by 12@xmath23 between each set .",
    "bright cluster galaxies in the frames were used to accurately register the successive frames for coaddition .",
    "sky and normalized flat - field frames were created from the data at each wavelength separately , taking the clipped mean of nine frames centered in time on the frame of interest .",
    "the seeing , as determined from several stellar images in the field , was approximately 0.5@xmath18 ",
    "0.6@xmath18 fwhm .",
    "the data were calibrated using calibration stars of persson ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the images , low resolution grism spectra were obtained of selected sources within the arc .",
    "these spectra were obtained over the wavelength range 1.5 ",
    "2.4@xmath1 m ( 0.25  0.40 @xmath1 m in the rest frame ) .",
    "the slit was 0.7@xmath18 wide yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath24/@xmath25 .",
    "slit position angles of @xmath26 and @xmath27 were used .",
    "the brightest portion of the fold arc c , the knot and the northwest end ( franx et al .",
    "1997 ) was contained in the slit for the pa @xmath26 spectrum , while the slit was aligned with the arc for the pa @xmath27 spectrum .",
    "for each position angle the integration time was 3000 s. the knot at the nw end of arc c was chosen because it was the brightest of the lensed knots , although the data of franx et al show that the strength of ly@xmath3 is clearly lower at that position ( the equivalent width of ly@xmath3 at this location drops to 1/3 of its value elsewhere in the arc ) .",
    "the @xmath20 image of the field of cl1358 + 62 is shown in figure 1a .",
    "locations b and c in the nomenclature of franx et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are labeled .",
    "the arc is seen in the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 images over the entire spatial range in which it is visible in the hst images .",
    "the arc was also detected in the narrowband image at a level consistent with the @xmath22 band continuum image and shows that the [ neiii ] line does not contribute significantly to the flux ( equivalent width @xmath2850  ) in the arc .    in order to directly compare the keck images with the hst image we have convolved the hst @xmath12 image with the measured seeing of the keck data . in table 1",
    "we report photometry at @xmath12 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in three beams ; position 1 is a circular beam including the brightest peak in the arc at position c , position 2 includes the full arc from b to c with the beam shaped to mimic the arc but excluding the brightest knot , and position 3 is the sum of the first two beams .",
    "figure 1b shows the shape of the beam of position 3 .    to derive photometry that is less sensitive to the presence of the bright elliptical galaxy north - northeast of the fold arc , we first determined the surface brightness profile of this galaxy in each of the images using an ellipse fitting program .",
    "we subtracted the resulting model distribution from the images .",
    "this produced a flat background at the location of the arc that reduced the uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "the @xmath20 band image formed in this way is shown in figure 1b . to minimize the uncertainties in the photometry",
    ", we made the sky beam as large as possible while avoiding the field objects near the arc .",
    "the photometry obtained with and without the elliptical galaxy removed from the image was indistinguishable at all wavelengths . because we felt the results were more robust ,",
    "the photometry with the elliptical galaxy removed is reported in table 1 .",
    "the spectrum at pa @xmath26 , taken with the bright knot of the fold arc c centered in the slit , shows that the continuum was detected at low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "no convincing detection of the arc was made in the spectrum at pa @xmath27 .",
    "no lines were detected in either spectrum over the wavelength range 0.25  0.40 @xmath1 m in the rest frame of the object .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the equivalent width of 100   for any emission line over the wavelength range 0.34  0.40 @xmath1 m and a limit of 200   in the equivalent width of any emission line over the wavelength range 0.250.34@xmath1 m ( the higher limit at shorter wavelengths is a result of the strong oh airglow emission in the h band ) .",
    "since there is at best only marginal evidence for any color difference between positions 1 and 2 , we adopt the highest signal - to - noise measurements of the sum of these apertures ( position 3 ) to determine the intrinsic energy distribution of the source galaxy .",
    "this was determined by measuring the colors @xmath29 $ ] at position 3 and subtracting these colors from the intrinsic @xmath30 mag of the lensed galaxy g1 determined by franx et al .",
    "this leads to intrinsic ( unmagnified ) magnitudes for g1 of 22.4 , 22.3 , and 21.5 mag at @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we do not believe that the quality of the data warrant interpreting the results in terms of color variations across the lensed object . in the discussion that follows the derived quantities refer to the intrinsic ( unlensed ) galaxy .",
    "the near infrared wavelengths correspond to rest frame uv and blue in the lensed galaxy , with the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 images being at 2150 , 2790 , and 3720  , respectively .",
    "the broadband colors potentially suffer from contamination by strong emission lines . in the @xmath22 band",
    "the strongest potential contamination is due to [ oii]3727  emission .",
    "the limit of 100  on the rest frame equivalent width of the [ oii ] line in the spectrum of the bright knot of c limits the contamination of the @xmath22 continuum to @xmath3120% of the total observed flux in the band .",
    "this limit is consistent with that seen in young star  forming galaxies at @xmath32 by cowie et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who find an average rest ",
    "frame equivalent width in [ oii ] of 60 .",
    "the limit on [ oii ] equivalent width limits the increase in the spectral index due to line contamination in @xmath22 to @xmath33 0.3 , where the spectral index is defined as @xmath34 . in the @xmath21 band ,",
    "the strongest potential contaminant is mgii 2800 , while in the j band it is ciii ] 1909 .",
    "our limit on the mgii line is not particularly significant , while we do not have spectra covering the ciii ] wavelength .",
    "the ciii ] and mgii lines are not seen in the nuclear spectra of nearby starbursts such as ngc 4214 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1996 ) or blue compact galaxies such as haro 2 ( thuan 1990 ) , while our limit on [ oii]3727  is consistent with the strongest lines seen in nearby blue galaxies by gallagher et al .",
    "thus we conclude that the effect of line emission on the derived colors is at most comparable to the uncertainties in the observations .",
    "the slope of the continuum is well characterized by @xmath35 .",
    "although this is fairly blue , it not as blue as models predict for young , ionizing starburst populations ( e.g. , leitherer and heckman 1995 ) .",
    "most of their models predict a slope @xmath36 for ages smaller than @xmath37 years ( as needed for the observed ly @xmath3  see below ) .",
    "the redder colors we observe can be produced either by dust , or by the presence of older stars . in both cases",
    "the mass of the stellar population would be seriously underestimated if the masses are estimated from the bluest passband . to address this issue",
    ", we made fits to the spectral energy distribution using the models by bruzual and charlot ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "we considered models for populations with instantaneous starbursts and with constant star formation rates and have included the effect of reddening .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "instantaneous starburst models with ages between @xmath38 and @xmath37 years are shown in figures 2a and 2c .",
    "the age of the burst population has to be lower than @xmath37 years to provide the ionizing flux for the ly @xmath3 emission .",
    "the imf was assumed to be a salpeter law .",
    "figure 2a shows models with no reddening fit to the data including the i photometry , while figure 2c shows models fit to the data where reddening is a free parameter .",
    "the models can provide good fits with a dust reddening @xmath39 between 0.26 and 0.37 mag , but do not fit the data satisfactorily when reddening is not included .",
    "the masses of the stellar population were in the range of 5 to @xmath40 @xmath6 .",
    "models with continuous star formation can also provide a good fit to the data once reddening is considered .",
    "figures 2b and 2d show models with ages up to @xmath41 years .",
    "we do not consider models with ages @xmath42 years since this is approximately the hubble time at z@xmath434.92 .",
    "as with the instantaneous burst models , the models in figure 2b assume no reddening , while in figure 2d reddening is a free parameter in the fit , and these models provide signficantly better fits than the dust free models .",
    "the required reddening @xmath39 lies between 0.15 and 0.39 mag .",
    "the required star formation rates lie between 130 and @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "the total stellar masses range from 7 to @xmath46 @xmath6 , for ages from @xmath37 to @xmath47 years , respectively .",
    "the mass becomes progressively larger with even greater ages .",
    "as can be seen in figure 2d , the models with ages @xmath48 years predict a strong balmer break , and this significantly reduces the quality of the fit . at an age of 10@xmath49 yr",
    ", the total chi square for the dust free model is 40 , while that containing dust is 4.6 .",
    "the observed equivalent width of ly @xmath3 between 7 and 21   does not provide a strong constraint on these continuous star forming models .",
    "the new data result in much higher mass estimates than the earlier estimates ( franx et al .",
    "1997 ) which were derived from the rest - frame far - uv flux ( observed @xmath7 @xmath50 ) .",
    "the masses are increased because the fluxes in the new redder passbands are significantly higher than predicted by the ( dust free ) models used by franx et al .",
    "an additional dependency with these new mass estimates is on the form of the extinction curve used .",
    "the calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) extinction curve is rather grey .",
    "if we use an smc extinction curve , we find that the absorption and stellar masses are decreased by a factor of about two .",
    "we can also estimate masses by ignoring the extinction and simply using the reddest flux , i.e. , the observed @xmath22 band flux , or restframe @xmath51 .",
    "we obtain masses of 1.1 to @xmath52 @xmath6 for the instantaneous burst models , and masses between 1.6 and @xmath53 for the continuous star formation models .",
    "these estimates are roughly one quarter of the estimates derived by using the calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) extinction curve , and about half the estimate derived from the smc extinction curve .",
    "we conclude therefore that the uncertainty in the mass estimate is about a factor of four .",
    "a realistic assessment of the likely mass is given by the geometric mean of the no - reddening values and the values based on the calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) extinction curve : masses between @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath6 for instantaneous bursts , and between @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath6 for continuous star formation models .",
    "the discussion of the last section has shown that the lensed galaxy has significant extinction , and we have derived new larger estimates for the stellar mass .",
    "the high stellar masses imply that the galaxy has built up a very dense center .",
    "the knot , which has an effective radius of 130 pc , contains roughly half the mass , i.e. , 1.2 to @xmath58 @xmath6 ( franx , et al , 1997 ) . assuming an isothermal profile , we derive a velocity dispersion of the knot between 100 and 260 km s@xmath59 .",
    "our new results have therefore strengthened the case that this young galaxy at @xmath60 has already managed to build up a very dense core .",
    "the resulting dynamical timescale for the knot is a few times @xmath61 year , comparable to the age derived from a starburst model .",
    "the dynamical timescale for the galaxy as a whole is at least 10 times higher .",
    "this exceeds the lifetime of ionizing o stars .",
    "combined with the fact that the emission and absorption line properties observed by franx et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicate the presence of a strong wind which locally depletes the interstellar medium in this galaxy , it is likely that we are seeing young , short lived condensations of star formation . over time , these knots would brighten progressively across the galaxy , as suggested earlier by lowenthal et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "the infrared photometry has demonstrated that dust is very likely present in the galaxy .",
    "this conclusion clearly depends on the accuracy of the stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the reddening is estimated to be between @xmath62 mag@xmath63 mag , depending on the population model and extinction curve .",
    "these values are comparable to those found in nearby , low metallicity , starbursts ( e.g. , meurer et al 1997 .",
    "this implies that the galaxy has been able to produce a significant amount of metals , but the observations to date are inadequate to derive metallicities .",
    "we note that similar results were derived by ellingson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for ms1512-cb58 and for galaxies in the hubble deep field by sawicki and yee ( 1998 ) .",
    "the optical and infrared fluxes of ms1512-cb58 at @xmath64 imply a young age ( @xmath37 years ) and a significant extinction ( @xmath65 mag ) .",
    "the constraints on the age of the young population were stronger because the observations extended beyond the balmer break . in the case of the hubble deep field , sawicki and yee have found that spectral energy distributions with reddening of @xmath66mag provides better fits to the observations of @xmath67 lyman break galaxies than do dust free models .",
    "the best studied high redshift galaxies have significant amounts of dust while evidence for dust exists for other high redshift galaxies based on sparser color information ( e.g. , meurer et al .",
    "1997 , pettini et al .",
    "if the lensed galaxies are typical , then a reddening between @xmath68 mag should be expected for most high redshift galaxies .",
