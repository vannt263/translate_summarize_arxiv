    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached binaries which contain a white dwarf and a late - type secondary star ( @xcite ) . the overflowing gas from the roche lobe - filling secondary star forms an accretion disk , which plays a key role in various activities of cvs . from the photometric and spectroscopic characteristics ,",
    "the systems are classified with some sub - groups , for example , classical novae , dwarf novae ( dne ) , nova - like variables ( nls ) , and magnetic cvs of polars and intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been detected in cvs on a variety of time scales .",
    "rapid qpos with a period of a few seconds have been observed in some magnetic cvs .",
    "they are considered to originate from the shock region between a white dwarf and accretion streams ( langer et al .",
    "1981 , 1982 ) . during dn outbursts , we know three types of temporary short - term modulations , that is , dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ) , qpos , and super - qpos .",
    "dnos are highly coherent modulations with typical periods of a few tens of seconds .",
    "the period of qpos during dn outbursts is generally longer than that of dnos ( @xmath5@xmath6 s ) .",
    "dnos and qpos have been reported also in some nls and classical novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of dnos has been proposed to be a white dwarf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , an inner edge of the disk ( @xcite ) or a boundary layer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; however , it is still an issue . on the other hand , the oscillation of a disk or",
    "a boundary layer has been suggested for qpos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . while the amplitudes are quite small ( @xmath7 ) in dnos and qpos , super - qpos have higher amplitudes , reaching @xmath8 .",
    "this modulation , whose period is typically a few minutes , has been detected only in the early and late phase of superoutbursts in some su uma - type dne ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discovered new variable stars in the course of their search for galaxies with a low - dispersion objective prism survey .",
    "according to @xcite , the `` no . 2 '' object showed brightness variations of @xmath0@xmath1 . in conjunction with strong balmer emission lines and a weak he  ii 4686   emission line ,",
    "@xcite suggested that it is a dn .",
    "this object was called fbs 0756 + 164 by @xcite and given a general gcvs name of dw cnc ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite supported this classification based on a new spectrum whose characteristics are analogous to that reported by @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on our time - series photometric monitoring of dw cnc , in which we discovered unprecedentedly large - amplitude and long - period qpos . in the next section ,",

    "figure [ fig : lc1 ] shows long - term light curves of dw cnc . the crosses with error bars represent the average magnitudes with standard errors each night .",
    "the light curve in the upper panel includes all visual observations reported to variable star network ( vsnethttp://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath9 ) , which are depicted with the open circles and the triangles ( upper - limits ) .",
    "the lower panel is a light curve focused on our ccd observations . as can be seen in the upper panel , the object varied between 1415 mag most of the time . during our observations , shown in the lower panel ,",
    "the object showed no significant fading or brightening trend .",
    "we calculated the average magnitude to be @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite proposed that dw cnc is a dn with the variation range of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic which we observed , as shown in figure [ fig : lc1 ] , is , however , inconsistent with that of the dn light curves .",
    "z cam stars , which form a sub - group of dne , are known to experience a phase called `` standstill '' , which is a phase with constant brightness interrupting ordinary outburst cycles ( @xcite )",
    ". it is , however , less likely that the period of constant brightness of dw cnc is a standstill , because the long monitoring of visual observations shows no ordinary outburst phase over six years .",
    "it may be possible that the long bright state is indeed a quiescent state of a dwarf nova having a long recurrence time , such as wz sge stars .",
    "this scenario , however , apparently contradicts the presence of the faint phase , which is indicated by a few observations fainter than 15 mag in figure [ fig : lc1 ] and the originally proposed amplitude of @xmath0@xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long - term variations of dw cnc are analogous to nls or magnetic cvs , rather than dne .",
    "figure [ fig : lc1 ] indicates that the duration of the possible faint state is probably shorter than that of the high state . although we could obtain no estimation of the magnitude at the time when the spectroscopy was performed by @xcite and @xcite , it is less likely that both of the spectra were taken during the temporal short - duration faint states .",
    "the case of a magnetic cv is thus apparently inconsistent with the lack of a strong he  ii emission line ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we hence suggest that dw cnc is neither a dn nor a magnetic system , but a nl .",
    "we can not conclude whether dw cnc has changed its nature as a dn or it was just a mis - classification , since no light curve is available in @xcite . on the other hand , the hints of possible faint states are reminiscent of the long - term variations of vy scl - type stars , a sub - group of nls showing temporary low states ( @xcite ) .",
    "the variations between 1415 mag seen in the visual observations can be explained by short - term variations with relatively large amplitudes , which we describe in the following section .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)lc1.ps      during our ccd monitoring , we detected oscillations whose typical light curves are shown in figure [ fig : lc2 ] . as shown in this figure , they appear to have no constant period , but variable profiles and a quasi - periodic nature .",
    "they have a coherence time of at least a few cycles , as can be seen in figure [ fig : lc2 ] .",
    "we can not find any firm evidence of a long - term coherence of these variations within our limited available data due to the short base - lines of each observation . through a period analysis",
    ", we confirmed that no clear coherent peak exists in the power spectrum between periods of 1200 min .",
    "we show a wide - range power spectrum in figure [ fig : pow ] . in this figure ,",
    "the abscissa and the ordinate denote the frequency in cycle day@xmath11 and the power in arbitrary units , respectively .",
    "we can find two prominent peaks with wide widths , which demonstrate the qpo nature of the oscillations .",
    "we determined their center periods to be @xmath3 and @xmath4 min by fitting gaussian functions .",
    "the shorter qpo period is probably the first harmonic of the longer one ; however , due to the small difference between them , we can not completely exclude the possibility that they are periodicity independent .",
    "we show the average light curve of modulations folded with the 73.4-min period in figure [ fig : ave ] .",
    "we can see the main peak around the phase @xmath12 and the sub peak around the phase @xmath13 .",
    "( 180mm,110mm)lc2.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)ave.ps",
    "the qpo in dw cnc is unique regarding its long lifetime , large amplitude and long period of kilo - second .",
    "qpos in cvs generally have periods of over one order of magnitude shorter than that in dw cnc ( @xcite ) .",
    "although kilo - second qpos have been reported in some cvs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , their amplitudes are quite small ( @xmath14 a few percent ) compared with those in dw cnc .",
    "the amplitude of qpos in dw cnc is typically about 0.3 mag and , furthermore , we detected a large flare - like peak whose amplitude reached to 0.6 mag , as can be seen in the upper - right panel of figure [ fig : lc2 ] .",
    "we clearly detected the oscillation , or a part of it , in our all observations with a long time - coverage , as shown in figure [ fig : lc2 ] .",
    "although the light curves in the lower - middle and right panel in figure [ fig : lc2 ] are more noisy due to the bad seasonal condition , they show a clear presence of oscillations with amplitudes and period similar to those in the upper panels .",
    "it is thus probable that the qpo has appeared throughout our observations for 61 days .",
    "except for the two qpos , the power spectrum shows other noteworthy characteristics .",
    "it indicates the presence of a significant power for frequencies lower than 10 @xmath15 .",
    "the power suddenly weakens at frequencies higher than the 37.5-min qpo .",
    "these features of the power spectrum are qualitatively analogous to that in black hole binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "the poisson noise dominates for frequencies higher than 100 cycle d@xmath11 , where the spectrum becomes flat .",
    "in this section , we compare dw cnc with the other cvs which also show similar oscillations to evaluate whether their proposed models can be applied to the qpo in dw cnc .      some ips show periodic variations on the order of kilo - second ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , which are interpreted as being the rotational period of a white dwarf . in the case of gk per",
    ", the long - period qpo ( @xmath16 ) reported in @xcite is proposed to be a beat phenomenon between the spin of a white dwarf and blobs orbiting at a disk - overflow impact site ( @xcite ) or between the accreting curtain and ordinary dn qpos ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long period seen in dw cnc may prefer a beat scenario rather than a direct spin variation .",
    "the most essential objection against this model is that dw cnc shows no direct evidence for an ip .",
    "the two spectra obtained by @xcite and @xcite show no strong he  ii emission and , moreover , we detected no firm evidence of a short periodicity originating from the white - dwarf spin",
    ". it may be possible that the shorter periodicity of 37.5-min is not the first harmonic of the longer periodicity , but is associated with the spin period . in this case , the kilo - second qpo can be interpreted with the beat between the white - dwarf spin and @xmath17-min qpo . within our available data , the broad profile of the 37.5-min peak in the power spectrum ,",
    "however , supports that this also has the qpo nature , and probably corresponds to the first harmonic of the 73.4-min qpo .",
    "thin - disk oscillations have been proposed to explain the characteristics of qpos both in dne and x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) . in a standard disk during dn outbursts ,",
    "the oscillation wave propagating inward is reflected at the radius where the wave frequency is equal to the epicyclic frequency .",
    "since the wave can not propagate in an outer cool disk , the wave is trapped in a narrow region .",
    "the wave is thus excited enough to be detected as qpos in dne ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although dw cnc is definitely not a dn , we can expect the condition of an accretion disk analogous to that during dn outbursts , since the object is most likely to be a nl , which is generally believed to have a sufficiently high mass - accretion rate to form a fully - ionized disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the balmer emission lines , furthermore , indicate the presence of an optically thin plasma around the disk . in the case of dn outbursts",
    ", the qpo frequency is theoretically expected to become higher with time due to an inward propagation of the transition layer ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the model can explain the long lifetime of the qpo in dw cnc with no apparent period shortening , since we can expect a quasi - steady disk system in the case of nls .",
    "@xcite reported 50-min qpos in a nl , mv lyr and also suggest applying of the trapped disk oscillation model .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the trapped oscillation model provides the expected qpo period , which is the inverse of the keplerian frequency at the transition layer , that is , @xmath18 . with the @xmath19 qpo , we estimate @xmath20 , assuming a white - dwarf mass of @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath22 is reasonable in cvs with an orbital period longer than about three hours .",
    "the disk - oscillation scenario can thus be an acceptable model for the qpo in dw cnc if its orbital period is above the period gap .",
    "this scenario , however , was originally proposed to explain the ordinary dn qpo , which has amplitudes typically smaller than @xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite ) . while @xcite proposed this model for @xmath24 qpos",
    "observed in mv lyr , the amplitude reaching @xmath25 in dw cnc may be too large for this model to reproduce .",
    "the large amplitude and the relatively long period are rather analogous to superhumps which are observed during superoutbursts in su uma - type dne ( @xcite ) .",
    "superhumps are modulations which generally have a period a few percent longer than an orbital period .",
    "according to the tidal instability model , this phenomenon is caused by the gradual precession of an eccentric disk which is developed by an enhanced tidal effect at the 3:1 resonance ( @xcite ) . as expected from this model ,",
    "superhumps have been reported not only in su uma - type dne , but also in nls and am cvn stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . if qpos in dw cnc are superhumps , its period is probably the longer one , i.e. , 73.4 min .",
    "this is because the 37.5-min period indicates that the system is an am cvn object ; however , it contradicts the balmer emissions observed in the optical spectra . according to @xcite , a system with a shorter orbital period generally has a smaller superhump excess , @xmath26 . assuming @xmath27 ( @xcite )",
    ", we can roughly estimate the orbital period of dw cnc to be 71.372.0 min .",
    "this is the shortest orbital period in hydrogen - rich cvs , except for the su uma - type dne , v485 cen ( @xmath28 ; @xcite ) and 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 ( @xmath29 ; @xcite ) .",
    "dw cnc may thus be a permanent superhumper below the period minimum if its orbital period is 7080 min .",
    "our photometric monitoring of the cataclysmic variable dw cnc revealed that the object remained at @xmath30 for 61 days .",
    "this characteristic of the long term light curve indicates that it is not a dwarf nova , which was originally proposed in @xcite , but a nova - like object .",
    "it is less likely that the object includes a white dwarf with a strong magnetic field , since both optical spectra obtained by @xcite and @xcite show only weak he  ii emission .",
    "the possible presence of faint states implies the vy scl - type nature of dw cnc .",
    "we discovered kilo - second quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in dw cnc , whose center periods were calculated to be @xmath3 and @xmath31 .",
    "compared with typical dwarf - nova qpos , the oscillation of dw cnc is unique regarding the large amplitude , long period , and long lifetime .",
    "we propose possible interpretations for dw cnc qpos : ( i ) the trapped disk oscillation scenario , which can be acceptable if the orbital period is above the period gap .",
    "( ii ) the superhump scenario , which can be acceptable if it is below the period minimum .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual ccd estimates via vsnet .",
    "part of this work was supported by a research fellowship of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists ( mu ) .",
