    "taking into account only the screened ( color ) electric interaction which is weakened at the debye mass scale @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath3 is the quark chemical potential ) , the early studies  @xcite predicted a rather small pairing gap @xmath4mev for moderate density where @xmath5 ( @xmath6mev is the qcd energy scale ) .",
    "the breakthrough in this field of research was made in  @xcite where it was observed that the pairing gap is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the previous prediction using the instanton - induced interactions and the phenomenological four - fermion interactions .",
    "on the other hand , it was first pointed out by son that at asymptotic high densities , the unscreened magnetic interaction dominates  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a non - bcs gap @xmath7  @xcite where @xmath8 , which matches the large magnitude of @xmath9 at moderate density predicted by the instanton - induced interactions and the phenomenological four - fermion interactions .",
    "such gaps at moderate density are so large that they may fall outside of the applicability range of the usual bcs - like mean - field theory . it was estimated that the size of the cooper pairs or the superconducting coherence length @xmath10 becomes comparable to the averaged interquark distance @xmath11  @xcite at moderate density where @xmath12 .",

    "this indicates that the color superconducting quark matter at moderate density is in the strongly coupled region or the bcs  bose - einstein condensation ( bcs - bec ) crossover  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the pairing fluctuation effects play important role in the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the pairing fluctuations on the quark spectral properties including possible pseudogap formation in heated quark matter ( above the color superconducting transition temperature ) were first elucidated by kitazawa , koide , kunihiro , and nemoto  @xcite .",

    "the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data in the equations of state and the single - particle spectral functions indicates that the pairing fluctuation effect is significant in the strongly interacting region , which defies the conventional bcs - like mean - field theory .    in this paper , we investigate the pairing fluctuation effects in the systems where pairing occurs among three species ( colors ) of fermions , in contrast to the ordinary bcs - bec crossover problem where pairing occurs between two fermion components",
