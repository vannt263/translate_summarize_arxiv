    "the galactic center ( gc ) is a unique laboratory for a detailed study of star formation and its impact on the nuclear environment of galaxies . because of its proximity",
    ", the gc can be imaged at resolutions more than 100 times better than the nearest galaxies like our own ( e.g. , the andromeda galaxy ) .",
    "this unmatched high - resolution capability is particularly important to the study of the formation and destruction processes of stellar clusters as well as the overall population of massive stars in such an environment .",
    "indeed , the gc is known to host three very massive clusters  ( the arches and quintuplet clusters , as well as the central parsec cluster surrounding sgr a@xmath4 ; ages @xmath5 yrs , masses @xmath6 each ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are responsible for about 5% of the total lyman continuum flux for the galaxy , in less than 0.01% of its volume .",
    "massive stars are known to exist outside the clusters  @xcite , however , locating these important stars has been sporadic and incomplete  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these isolated massive stars may have formed individually or in small groups , although the extreme conditions in the gc make this mode of star formation unusually difficult .",
    "they may also have been spun out of the clusters due to their internal dynamics .",
    "this process is expected to be accelerated by the strong external tidal force in the gc  @xcite .",
    "the star formation process depends critically on the interplay of massive stars with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "massive stars release large amounts of ultraviolet radiation .",
    "they also produce strong stellar winds throughout their short lives and die in supernova explosions .",
    "such energetic stellar output dramatically shapes the morphology of the ism , as is revealed in existing radio , mid - infrared , and x - ray maps  ( fig .",

    "perhaps the best - known example of this is the radio arc region which surrounds the arches and quintuplet clusters : a collection of arc - like thermal filaments , synchrotron - bright non - thermal linear filaments , and diffuse , hot gas .",
    "some of the structures within this region , the sickle hii region ionization front and photoevaporated pillars in particular , suggest that gas is being collected and compressed  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cotera et al . in preparation ) , and is morphologically resembles known regions outside the gc where such processes are believed to have led to the formation of a new generation of stars ( e.g. m16 ; @xcite ) . the energy injection from massive stars and possibly from the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , that is coincident with the radio source sgr a * , may also strongly affects the thermal and/or dynamical properties of the ism .",
    "molecular gas in the gc , for example , has unusually high turbulent velocities and temperatures compared to clouds in other parts of the galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may bias the stellar initial mass function toward heavier stars and favor the production of massive star clusters  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to constrain the dynamical process of the known clusters , the overall population of massive stars , and their formation modes , we sought to obtain a uniform survey of massive stars and their interplay with the ism across the central 90 parsecs .",
    "ionized warm gas provides the ideal tracer of massive stars and their interplay with their surroundings .",
    "although previous radio continuum observations are free of extinction and trace both thermal and non - thermal emission , the scale - dependence of radio interferometers makes it difficult to accurately measure flux densities on arcsecond scales . in addition , fine features ( e.g. , ionization fronts ) are often found in the midst of diffuse non - thermal emission ( e.g. , the radio arc ) , making decomposition of thermal and non - thermal components challenging .",
    "radio recombination line observations typically have a substantially lower signal - to - noise and spatial resolution than radio continuum data . in the near - ir ,",
    "the 2.16  br@xmath7 line is accessible from the ground ( no suitable filter is available for existing and planned space - based platforms ) , but has also not proved effective for large scale mapping of warm ionized gas . to our knowledge , no large - scale br@xmath7 line survey of the gc has ever been published .",
    "the difficulty lies in the lack of the combination of high spatial resolution and stable point spread function ( psf ) in a ground - based survey .",
    "observations with adaptive optics ( ao ) can have superb resolution , but only over small fields of view ( typically @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ao psf also changes strongly , both spatially and with time , and has extended psf wings , making the psf subtraction extremely difficult .",
    "in addition , photometric conditions rarely , if ever , persist for the time required for such a survey , hampering the study of large - scale features .",
    "we have carried out the first large - scale , high - resolution , near - ir survey of the gc , using _ hst _",
    "the primary objective of the survey is to map out the hydrogen paschen-@xmath0 ( p@xmath0 for short ) line ( wavelength 1.876 @xmath9 ) in a field of @xmath10 around sgr a@xmath4  ( corresponding to 90 pc @xmath11 35 pc at the gc distance of 8  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this field is known to be rich in clustered massive star formation ( i.e. , including the three known clusters ) .",
    "nicmos observations of the p@xmath0 emission were taken previously only for a few discrete regions , centered on the three known massive clusters ( see   [ ss : comparion ] for further discussion ) .",
    "our survey field also includes much unexplored territory . in particular , the region between sgr a and sgr c along the galactic plane ( to the right in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) shows a number of compact _ spitzer _ irac sources ( several with radio counterparts ) likely related to some of the earliest stages of massive star activities .",
    "this field selection also facilitates an unbiased study of the apparent asymmetry between the positive and negative galactic longitude sides relative to sgr a@xmath4 .",
    "our  nicmos observations overcome all of the potential problems of a ground - based survey .",
    "the wide nic3 camera on this instrument provides a resolution of @xmath12 with a stable psf .",
    "this capability is important for detecting and cleanly removing point - like sources as well as resolving fine structures of extended features .",
    "both the stable psf and the absence of atmosphere for our  survey means that the entire survey is photometrically accurate and consistent .",
    "the extra magnitude of extinction along the sight - line to the gc at 1.87  ( as compared to 2.16 ) is more than compensated for by an intrinsic p@xmath0 line intensity 12 times greater than the br@xmath7 line  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the background at p@xmath0 with nicmos is a factor of @xmath13 lower than the sky background at br@xmath7 as observed from the ground .",
    "this low background of nicmos also allows us to detect faint point - like sources and extended features , particularly over our large mosaicked field .",
    "our survey was completed in 144 hst orbits between february 22 and june 5 , 2008 .",
    "all of these orbits had an identical design , each consisting of @xmath14 nic3 pointing positions for both f187n ( on - line ) and f190n ( off - line ) filters .",
    "these filters have a 1% bandpass centered at the wavelengths 1.875@xmath9 and 1.900 @xmath9 .",
    "nic3 is a 256@xmath11 256 hgcdte array detector with a pixel size of @xmath15 in the x and y directions .",
    "adjacent positions and orbits were designed to have 3@xmath16  overlaps in the vertical direction of the nic3 array coordinates , partly to allow for the bottom 15 pixels that do not provide useful data due to afocal vignetting of that portion of the array .",
    "this is in addition to the overlaps resulting from the 4-point dithers at each of the four positions of an orbit .",
    "each dither exposure was taken in the multiaccum readout mode ( samp - seq=16 ; nsamp=9 ) for photometry over a large flux range and for effective identification and removal of cosmic - rays and saturated pixels .",
    "the 4-point dithers were in an inclined square wave pattern ( i.e. , the shifts were in the directions of 67@xmath17.5 relative to the x - axis of the detector coordinates ) ; each dither step produced a shift of 233 and 563 pixels in the x and y directions .",
    "this dither pattern enabled both a sub - pixel sampling of the undersampled nic3 psf and a consistent overlap between orbits .",
    "each orbit effectively covered an area of roughly 102@xmath18 ( 2.8 arcmin@xmath19 ) . with this strategy and a single telescope orientation ,",
    "the survey mapped out a field of 416 arcmin@xmath19 ( as outlined in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) , and with a uniform 192 sec exposure per filter .",
    "the entire science data set includes 144 ( orbits ) @xmath11 4 ( pointing positions ) @xmath11 4 ( dithers ) @xmath11 2 ( filters ) @xmath20 images .",
    "in addition , between target visibility periods ( during earth occultations ) after each of the 144 orbits , 16 dark frames were obtained with the detector clocked in a manner identical to the science exposures .",

    "[ f : fig2]b or [ f : fig3]b ) is a  emission source based only on its apparent excess above the background ; such a peak can easily be caused by the statistical flux fluctuation of a subtracted source , especially a bright one .",

    "we further remove any uniformly - distributed foreground and residual instrument background in a map by shifting its intensity to zero , averaged over a few darkest regions ( see   [ s : results ] ) .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] shows a panoramic view of our survey data . clearly , the distribution of both the stellar light and the diffuse emission is highly inhomogeneous , partly due to the variations in foreground extinction , which varies strongly from one region to another and on different spatial scales .",

    "[ f : fig2 ] are the distinct dark filaments ( tendrils ) in the field just above sgr a , which are also noticeable in published k - band images  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "f : fig2]c shows extended -emitting complexes across much of the field .",
    "strong and distinctive emission features are seen on angular scales from sub - arcsecond to about 10@xmath21 , with surface brightness ranging from as high as @xmath31 down to a 3@xmath27 level of @xmath32 for the image with the 04 @xmath11 04 pixel .",
    "the rms noise of a map depends on its pixel size and is @xmath33 for the full resolution image with a pixel size of 01 @xmath11 01 , accounting for both statistical and systematic fluctuations ( photon counting , artifacts from stellar continuum subtraction , etc . ) .",
    "this noise is estimated from selected regions in the  map  ( e.g. , at the upper right corner of the map ; see * ? ? ? * for details ) that show little  emission but are bright in the f190n continuum image ( hence the rms contribution from clumpy structures in the  emission or extinction should be minimal ) .",
    "the overall distribution of the  emission is highly lopsided toward the positive galactic longitude side of the gc , similar to what is seen in radio and mid - ir ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the diffuse  emission is greatly enhanced around the three known clusters responsible for the ionization of the inner rims of surrounding gas .",
    "the emission around the gc cluster is largely confined within a small spiral - like nuclear structure , the  emission of which was first detected by  @xcite .",
    "our new survey now enables us to trace the faint emission features to large distances , which extend vertically below and above this structure ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig4]a ) .",
    "these features may represent outflows from the central few parsecs of the galaxy .",

    "[ f : fig5 ] shows a selection of compact -emitting nebulae",
    ". some of these enigmatic nebulae may represent individual massive stars in formation ( e.g. , first row in fig .",
    "[ f : fig5 ] ) , whereas others may be due to stellar ejecta and/or their interaction with dense ambient medium ( second and third rows ) .",
    "the survey also enables us to perform an unprecedentedly uniform , high resolution , photometrically sensitive census of the stellar population .",
    "our preliminary detection based on the f190n continuum image gives a total of about 0.6 million point - like sources , which accounts for about 86% of the total observed f190n intensity in the survey field .",
    "this is the highest ratio of resolved point sources to continuum emission achieved to date in the very crowded gc field ( e.g. , figs .",
    "[ f : fig2]a and  [ f : fig3]a ) .",
    "the median of the unresolved intensity is @xmath34 , averaged over the surveyed field .",
    "our 50% source detection limit is about 17th mag in the f190n band .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows that we should detect most of the massive main - sequence stars ( earlier than b3 , corresponding to @xmath35 ) in the region as well as the bulk of red giants , including red clump stars .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of the detected sources and the still unresolved intensity will allow us to infer the overall intrinsic structure of the stellar light distribution in the gc and to provide quantitative measurements of the foreground extinction .",
    "our preliminary analysis has resulted in the detection of about 200 -emitting star candidates . before the publication of such candidates ,",
    "however , we still need additional careful examination , especially for relatively weak sources , to minimize potential systematic contamination ( e.g. , due to local enhancements of diffuse  complexes ) .",
    "we easily detect all previously known emission line stars throughout the survey region ( @xmath36 total ; mostly wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "we have already verified an additional 30 emission line stars via spectroscopic follow - up observations  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cotera et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we anticipate that further follow up observations will at least double that number again .",
    "more importantly , over half of the newly identified stars are located outside the three known clusters .",
    "therefore we have already more than doubled the number of known intercluster emission line stars .",
    "the newly discovered stars will enable us to address in greater detail the formation of massive stars outside clusters in our upcoming papers .",
    "in particular , the  star candidates outside the clusters are not distributed in a completely random fashion .",
    "in addition to the p@xmath0 emission line , the f187n filter contains a few helium lines which are often strong emission lines in wolf - rayet stars .",
    "therefore the most easily detected stars in the f187n filter are typically wolf - rayet stars , although future refinements to the data analysis will enable us to detect o and possible b supergiants as well , which have smaller  equivalent widths , in emission or absorption .",
    "such refinements may be achieved by modeling the broad - band spectral energy distribution together with the narrow band measurements of the p@xmath0 emission and absorption .",
    "while the data analysis , multi - wavelength comparison , follow - up observations , and modeling are still ongoing and will be presented in later papers , we discuss here the implications of the survey for addressing several key issues related to star formation and its impact on the gc environment :      two large questions remain unanswered about massive star formation in the gc : ( 1 ) do massive stars form exclusively in the clusters , or in looser associations throughout the field ? and ( 2 ) is star formation continuous , or does it happen in discrete bursts ? until recently ,",
    "massive ( e.g. , emission - line ) stars have mostly be found within the 3 gc clusters .",
    "a number of searches for young massive stars at infrared and x - ray wavelengths have been carried out  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies , each with diverse search criteria , have yielded a rather incomplete picture of the young massive star population in this gc .",
    "the p@xmath0 emission is a sensitive tracer of massive stars and their environs .",
    "the emission traces warm ionized gas , produced and maintained primarily by lyman continuum radiation from massive stars .",
    "such gas can be associated with individual stars ( e.g. , massive stellar winds ) , their immediate vicinities ( circumstellar material ) , and surrounding ism structures .",
    "the fact that the majority of our new sources are actually located outside the three known clusters has strong implications for understanding the dynamics of massive stars with ages of only a few @xmath37 yr . the exact time scales for clusters to be disrupted and the place where the stars end up provide information about the internal dynamics of the clusters as well as the large - scale tidal force of the gc  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the massive stars detected in our survey can be used to better constrain these processes throughout the field .",
    "the distributions of the stars and their types as well as follow - up work on both radial velocities and proper motions  @xcite will allow us to constrain how quickly the massive stellar clusters are currently dissolving , how many star clusters have been disrupted , and whether or not the stars are formed in massive clusters which have been subsequently dispersed , or formed in relative isolation .      in the high pressure and high density environment of the gc , the diffuse p@xmath0-emitting gas tends to be found at ionization fronts bordering molecular clouds .",
    "the gas density and pressure are expected to change drastically at such fronts  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high resolution p@xmath0 map resolves various ionization fronts , which helps to determine the local neutral gas density and the thermal pressure of diffuse warm ionized gas .",
    "the comparison between figs .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] and [ f : fig2 ] demonstrates the complicated relationship among various stellar and ism components . within the sickle region ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig4]b ) , for instance , we see two distinctive ionization front morphologies .",
    "we see columns of photo - evaporating gas similar to the elephant trunks or pillars seen in regions such as m16 in one part , but also a remarkably smooth ionization front located on another side of the large hii region .",
    "although very different , both are morphologically perpendicular to the brightest non - thermal radio filaments , which are uniquely found in the gc field and have been a long - standing mystery .",
    "they are known to trace enhanced magnetic field and/or cosmic rays .",
    "but the underlying physical processes remain unclear .",
    "the observed relative morphological configuration then suggests that the large - scale , inter - cloud , vertical ( poloidal ) magnetic field is combing through the dense gas and gets enhanced in the process .",
    "the expansion of the magnetized inter - cloud material , probably accompanied with cosmic ray acceleration , is likely driven by the strong mechanical energy output from the quintuplet and arches clusters , consistent with the barrel - shaped morphology of the nonthermal radio filaments ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the feedback from the clusters likely plays an important role in shaping the ism and the eco - system of the gc in general .",
    "a few p@xmath0 observations were made previously in the gc region .",
    "the sgr a west region , covering the inner @xmath38 4 pc of the galaxy , was observed using both nic3 and nic2  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several other programs concentrated only on the central parsec with nic1 .",
    "a nic2 p@xmath0 observation was also made for the core of the arches cluster  @xcite .",
    "the p@xmath0 emission from the pistol nebula ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig4]b ) was covered with a @xmath39 mosaic of nic2 observations , which had a smaller field of view  ( 192 on a side ; * ? ? ?",
    "our map shows considerably more structure in the diffuse  emission of the nebula than the image shown in  @xcite , apparently due to the higher sensitivity of our nic3 observations .",
    "in addition , our new data provide additional epochs for variability analysis in these regions with the existing observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our study of the gc region complements other efforts to understand galactic star forming regions , such as orion  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the carina nebula  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc 3603  @xcite , and westerlund 1  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is crucial to compare the time scales and efficiency with which stars form in the gc to those in other regions of the galactic disk in order to gain a detailed understanding of the interplay between massive stars and the ism .",

    "<S> we have recently carried out the first wide - field hydrogen paschen-@xmath0 line imaging survey of the galactic center ( gc ) , using the nicmos instrument aboard the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the survey maps out a region of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) around the central supermassive black hole ( sgr a * ) in the 1.87 and 1.90  narrow bands with a spatial resolution of @xmath3 pc ( 02 fwhm ) at a distance of 8 kpc . here </S>",
    "<S> we present an overview of the observations , data reduction , preliminary results , and potential scientific implications , as well as a description of the rationale and design of the survey . </S>",
    "<S> we have produced mosaic maps of the paschen-@xmath0 line and continuum emission , giving an unprecedentedly high resolution and high sensitivity panoramic view of stars and photo - ionized gas in the nuclear environment of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a significant number of previously undetected stars with paschen-@xmath0 in emission . </S>",
    "<S> they are most likely massive stars with strong winds , as confirmed by our initial follow - up spectroscopic observations . </S>",
    "<S> about half of the newly detected massive stars are found outside the known clusters ( arches , quintuplet , and central ) . </S>",
    "<S> many previously known diffuse thermal features are now resolved into arrays of intriguingly fine linear filaments indicating a profound role of magnetic fields in sculpting the gas . the bright spiral - like paschen-@xmath0 emission around sgr a * is seen to be well confined within the known dusty torus . in the directions roughly perpendicular to it , </S>",
    "<S> we further detect faint , diffuse paschen-@xmath0 emission features , which , like earlier radio images , suggest an outflow from the structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect various compact paschen-@xmath0 nebulae , probably tracing the accretion and/or ejection of stars at various evolutionary stages . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength comparisons together with follow - up observations are helping us to address such questions as where and how massive stars form , how stellar clusters are disrupted , how massive stars shape and heat the surrounding medium , how various phases of this medium are interspersed , and how the supermassive black hole interacts with its environment .    </S>",
