    "the twisted alexander polynomial was introduced by lin @xcite for knots in @xmath7 and by wada @xcite for finitely presentable groups .",
    "it is a generalization of the classical alexander polynomial and gives a powerful tool in low dimensional topology .",
    "one of the most important applications is the determination of fiberedness @xcite and genus ( the thurston norm ) @xcite of knots by the collection of the twisted alexander polynomials corresponding to all finite - dimensional representations .",
    "for literature on other applications and related topics , we refer to the survey paper by friedl and vidussi @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we study the twisted alexander polynomial @xmath0 of a knot @xmath1 associated to a representation @xmath2 of the knot group into @xmath3 .",
    "see section [ tap ] for a definiton of @xmath0 .",
    "in general , @xmath0 is a rational function in one variable .",
    "however if the representation @xmath2 is non - abelian , then @xmath0 is a laurent polynomial and has degree less than or equal to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the genus of @xmath1 .",
    "the twisted alexander polynomials of two conjugate representations are the same , hence we can always consider representations up to conjugation .",
    "it is known for every knot @xmath1 that if @xmath1 is fibered , then for every non - abelian representation , @xmath0 is monic @xcite and has degree @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "kim and morifuji @xcite recently proved the converse for @xmath6-bridge knots .",
    "in fact they proved a stronger result : if a @xmath6-bridge knot @xmath1 is non - fibered , then all but finitely many non - abelian representations on some component have @xmath0 non - monic and degree @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we look into two special families of non - fibered @xmath6-bridge knots , the knots @xmath8 and the twist knots .",
    "for these two families , we calculate the number of non - abelian representations where @xmath0 is monic and calculate the number of non - abelian representations where the degree of @xmath0 is less than @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath6-bridge knot associated to a pair of relatively prime odd integers @xmath10 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath11 the @xmath12-twist knot ( see figures [ even ] and [ odd ] in section 4 ) .",
    "then we have the following .    for @xmath13 , the number of ( conjugacy classes of ) non - abelian representations where the degree of @xmath0 is less than @xmath4 is equal to @xmath14 , and the number of non - abelian representations where @xmath0 is monic is also equal to @xmath14 .",

    "we review the definition of the twisted alexander polynomial and some related work on fibering and genus of knots in section [ tap ] . we then prove theorem [ m=3 ] in section 3 and theorem [ m = p-2 ] in section 4 .",
