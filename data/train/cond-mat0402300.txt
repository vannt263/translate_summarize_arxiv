    "complex adaptive systems consist of agents using adaptive strategies to compete for limited resources . as changes in the global environment",
    "are induced by the agents themselves , it is important to study dynamics of such systems . the minority game ( mg ) , proposed by challet and zhang@xcite , is a prototypical agent - based model that can be analyzed using the tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "the game captures some essential features of complex adaptive systems in which agents with limited information and rationality compete for limited resources .",
    "a key question in the study of agent - based models is , how evolution changes the behaviors of the agents .",
    "there have been a few studies on the effect of evolution in the minority game . in the context of a simple evolutionary minority game , johnson et al .",
    "found that the agents universally self - segregate into two opposing extreme groups @xcite .",
    "hod and nakar , on the other hand , claimed that clustering of cautious agents emerges in a `` tough environment '' where the penalty for losing is greater than the reward for winning @xcite .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite derived a general formalism to understand the dynamical mechanism for the transition from segregation to clustering .",
    "they found that the effective rate of evolution plays an important role in determining the resulting steady - state population distribution .",
    "these studies have focused mainly on population distribution .",
    "li et al .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , studied how evolution can help to improve the overall performance of the agents in the original mg .",
    "starting from the adaptive mg proposed by challet and zhang @xcite , li et al .",
    "introduced an evolutionary scheme in which all poorly performing agents evolve synchronously at every @xmath3 steps .",
    "agents are ranked by their gains , and those ranked at the bottom _",
    "percent ( _ _ p__=10% , 20% , 30% , 40% , etc ) are forced to change their strategies at these pre - specified steps . in order to make the evolution process smooth , not all the agents ranked at the bottom will change their strategies , but only 50% of those ( chosen randomly ) have to do so .",
    "those who are chosen to evolve replace the current strategies with new randomly picked ones .",
    "they reported that with evolution the performance is significantly better ; but the phase structure , characterized by the so called savit curve @xcite , remains similar to that of the original non - evolutionary mg . a later study @xcite based on a variant of the evolutionary scheme used in ref .",
    "@xcite led to a similar conclusion , but with better overall performance of the agents .",
    "when dealing with models of heterogeneous agent population , it makes sense to use an evolutionary scheme in which agents evolve individually , instead of synchronously at specified times . in this paper",
    "we adopt the simple scheme used in the emg @xcite , in which an agent becomes bankrupted and is replaced whenever its accumulated wealth is below a given threshold . with this simple scheme we found that herding behavior has disappeared when the memory length ( @xmath2 ) is small , and the savit curve obtained is significantly different from that of the original mg .",
    "let us first briefly describe the minority game model .",
    "the game concerns a population of @xmath1 ( odd number ) heterogeneous agents with limited capabilities , who repeatedly compete to be in the minority group .",
    "after each round the winners gain a point and the losers lose a point .",
    "each agent holds @xmath4 strategies .",
    "each strategy is a look - up table listing the strategy s prediction of the minority group given the record of the most recent @xmath2 minority groups .",
    "there are total @xmath5 number of possible strategies , so the larger the value of @xmath2 , the greater the processing power of the agents .",
    "virtual points are accumulated for each of the strategies the agent has , and he uses the most successful strategy available to him . to include the effect of evolution we assign wealth @xmath6 to each agent ;",
    "@xmath6 will increase / decrease by one when the agent wins / loses .",
    "the agent will be replaced if his wealth is below a threshold @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ; the new agent chooses his @xmath4 strategies randomly and his wealth is initialized to zero .",
    "the distribution of strategies gradually evolves as the game goes on .",
    "we have done extensive simulations with @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; and @xmath12 .",
    "the number of time steps used is set to be @xmath13 ; we have checked that this choice of the time step is sufficient for obtaining steady - state properties of the model . in our simulations",
    "we monitor @xmath0 , which is the standard deviation of the number of agents belonging to one of the groups .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath0 , the larger a typical minority group and the better the overall performance of the agents will be .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath0 is @xmath14 , which means that the difference between the numbers in the minority and majority groups is one .",
    "the overall performance of the agents is at the optimal when @xmath15 . at the other extreme , when the agents make their choices randomly as in the random choice game ( rcg )",
    ", we have @xmath16 . in almost all our simulations , particularly for small @xmath2 , evolution reduces @xmath0 significantly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 , which shows @xmath17 vs @xmath18 for the mg with and without evolution .",
    "the results are based on averages over eight independent runs , which are enough for obtaining accurate averages for the evolutionary mg , as the differences among different runs are quite small . for small @xmath2 evolution",
    "leads to a dramatic reduction in @xmath0 as herding behavior of the agents is greatly suppressed .",
    "the results for different @xmath1 fall to a universal curve . for large @xmath2",
    "the game still approaches the limit corresponding to the random choice game and the effect of evolution is small .",
    "vs @xmath18 for the mg with and without evolution .",
    "@xmath19 is used for the evolutionary mg .",
    "the results are obtained by averaging over eight independent runs , width=321 ]    we have also studied the model with the award - to - fine ratio ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the winners get @xmath21 points while the losers lose a point .",
    "we found that , for each @xmath1 , there is an optimal value of @xmath22 that gives rise to the smallest value of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath23 the average wealth is ever increasing and there is no steady state .",
    "2 shows @xmath17 vs @xmath18 for @xmath24 as compared to the case @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath0 can be further reduced when @xmath24 .",
    "we also found that , for @xmath26 or @xmath27 , the optimal value of @xmath28 can in fact be achieved .",
    "vs @xmath18 for the evolutionary mg .",
    "@xmath29 is used .",
    "the results are obtained by averaging over eight independent runs , width=321 ]",
    "we now consider a crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite to understand the effect of evolution in the minority game .",
    "our discussion below follows ref .  @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we only consider @xmath30 and use a reduced strategy space ( rss ) .",
    "numerically the differences between the cases with @xmath30 and @xmath31 are small .",
    "rss is a subset of strategies , which span the full strategy space ( fss ) .",
    "consider , for example , an rss for @xmath32 , consisting of the following eight strategies :      here @xmath34 indicate the prediction of a strategy given one of the four possible histories .",
    "any two strategies in \\{@xmath35 , @xmath36 } are either uncorrelated ( with the hamming distance @xmath37 ) or anti - correlated ( with the largest hamming distance @xmath38 ) . for a given @xmath2",
    "there are total @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) strategies with @xmath41 pairs of anti - correlated strategies ( other pairs are uncorrelated ) in rss . for each strategy",
    "@xmath42 in rss there is a corresponding anti - correlated strategy @xmath43 .",
    "it is believed that the essential features of the game are kept when rss is used instead of the fss @xcite .",
    "let us evaluate @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the numbers of agents making the choices @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the average is over time step @xmath49 . in rss @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the current history , @xmath52 is the response of strategy @xmath42 to the history bit - string @xmath51 , and @xmath53 is the number of agents using strategy @xmath42 at time @xmath49 .",
    "we have @xmath54 in our simulation we found that the system visits all possible histories equally .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which shows a histogram of the number of visits for each m - bit history .",
    "in order to compare with the non - evolutionary mg , we use @xmath31 in the figure ; the result for @xmath30 is essentially the same . as we can see from the figure",
    ", the system does not visit all possible histories equally in the non - evolutionary mg .      for the evolutionary mg we can thus replace an average over time by an average over all possible histories .",
    "now the double sum can be broken down into three parts , based on the correlation between the strategies .",
    "given @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , where @xmath61 indicates average over all possible histories , we can write the double sum as @xmath62\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\sum^{p}_{g=1}\\left[<n_g^2>_t - 2<n_g n_{\\bar{g}}>_t + < n_{\\bar{g}}^2>_t\\right]\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}\\sum^{p}_{g=1}<(n_g - n_{\\bar{g}})^2>_t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above derivation we have tacitly assumed that @xmath63 change very slowly so the averages over @xmath64 can be done while holding @xmath63 constant .",
    "this is in the spirit of adiabatic approximation ; it is valid because the evolution rate is low ( as long as @xmath65 is not too small ) .",
    "let @xmath66 be the number of pairs of agents holding anti - correlated strategies and @xmath67 be the number of agents holding unpaired strategies .",
    "only the agents holding unpaired strategies contribute to @xmath0 ; the game behaves essentially as an rcg with @xmath67 number of agents .",
    "thus we have @xmath68 , or @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 , @xmath66 can be written as @xmath72 . to determine @xmath73 we need to consider the evolutionary dynamics of the game . at the steady state we have the following balance equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the bankruptcy rate for the paired agents ( pair breaking rate ) and the bankruptcy rate for the unpaired agents respectively",
    "; @xmath77 is the probability that a new pair is formed when a bankrupted agent is replaced .",
    "one can estimate @xmath77 as @xmath78 it is somewhat difficult to estimate @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it can be argued that @xmath79 does not sensitively depend on @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the equation for @xmath73 is then @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the solution @xmath73 is a function of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , when we plot @xmath17 vs @xmath81 , the curves fall to a universal curve .",
    "since @xmath83 is a monotonically decreasing function of x , the universal curve @xmath84 obtained from the above equation will be a monotonically increasing function of z. in the limit @xmath85 we have @xmath86 ; this leads to @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath85 is the rcg limit . for @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath79 decreases ; this leads to smaller values for @xmath73 and @xmath0 .",
    "all these are in agreement with the simulation results .",
    "thus the crowd - anticrowd picture provides a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary mg .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that , when a simple evolutionary scheme is applied to a heterogeneous population of agents , herding behavior in the mg is greatly suppressed .",
    "the dependence of the standard deviation @xmath0 on the number of agents @xmath1 and the memory length @xmath2 can be characterized by a universal curve .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated that a crowd - anticrowd theory can be used to understand qualitatively the effect of evolution in the mg .",
