    "crl 2688 ( v1610 cyg , egg nebula ) is a bipolar proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) . the central star is thought to be a f5iae post - agb supergiant .",
    "initial studies of crl 2688 were mostly based on low resolution spectrophotometric and spectropolarimetric data and were made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the low resolution spectrophotometric observations revealed emission from c@xmath12 , c@xmath13 and sic@xmath12 .",
    "the swan bands of c@xmath12 are also seen in emission from the bipolar lobes @xcite . because the object is faint ( @xmath14 ) with significant circumstellar reddening its high resolution spectroscopy",
    "was not carried out until the year 2000 . the first high resolution ( @xmath15 ) optical spectra",
    "were analyzed by @xcite .",
    "they found that the central star is a f5iae post - agb supergiant with overabundance of carbon and s - process elements . @xcite",
    "derived @xmath16 k , @xmath17 , microturbulent velocity @xmath18 km s@xmath10 and [ fe / h]@xmath19 .",
    "high - spatial resolution _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "imaging revealed the detailed morphology of this object ; a flattened dust cocoon obscuring the central star as well as extended bipolar nebulae exhibiting numerous concentric arcs crossed by a pair of beam - like structures at the both sides of the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "these arcs are suggested to be associated with repeated mass - loss events during the agb phase @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the _ herschel space observatory _ - spire fts spectra of crl 2688 covering the wavelength range 195 to 670 @xmath20 m .",
    "they found the far infrared spectrum of crl 2688 to be very complex with about 18 different species of complex molecules .",
    "they also detected water in crl 2688 for the first time .",
    "crl 2688 shows small amplitude light variations with a period of about 90 days @xcite and some of the absorption and emission lines seems to show a radial velocity variability with time @xcite .",
    "the variability indicates that the central star as well as the circumstellar material is undergoing rapid variations in their dynamical and chemical properties possibly due to pulsation and mass - loss .",
    "mechanisms that give rise to observed complex morphology , chemistry and variability of crl 2688 as well as other post - agb stars are still far from being completely understood . identifying constraints on these mechanisms is important for understanding the chemical evolution of our galaxy since low - to - intermediate mass stars on the agb phase of evolution are thought to be mainly responsible for synthesizing and contributing with cno and s - process elements to the interstellar medium via mass loss .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of a much higher resolution spectrum of crl 2688 .",
    "a high resolution ( @xmath0 ) spectrum of crl 2688 was obtained with the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on july 14 , 2001 .",
    "the slit of 1 arcsec widths was positioned at the central star region . the wavelength range from 4300 to 9000",
    " was observed with an exposure time of 1200 sec .",
    "the data were reduced with standard iraf routines . the signal to noise ratio of the reduced spectrum per resolution element varies from 30 to 70 in this wavelength range .",
    "equivalent widths ( ew ) of atomic absorption lines were measured by fitting gaussian to each feature using a linelist described below .",
    "the reduced spectrum shows various photospheric absorption lines and molecular lines .",
    "a portion of the observed spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spec_example ] .",
    "absorption lines that are considered in the ew measurements taken from @xcite and @xcite are marked .          the obtained optical spectrum of crl 2688 exhibits numerous atomic absorption lines of metals , most of which are too weak to be used in the abundance analysis , as illustrated in figure [ fig : spec_example ] .",
    "many of the relatively strong lines like and show a blueshifted emission component superimposed on the absorption component as shown in figure [ fig : pcyg ] .",
    "the presence of emission component in the violet wing is in agreement with the suggestion from a spectropolarimetric observation of @xcite .",
    "the observed features indicate mass loss from the central star .",
    "the molecular lines in this star are likely originated from its circumstellar envelope , because such molecules would be destroyed in its photosphere with @xmath21 k. the spectral regions dominated by molecular bands are shown in figure [ fig : cmol1 ] and [ fig : cmol2 ] .",
    "strong emission bands of the c@xmath11 swan system are identified consistent with previous studies @xcite . the particularly strong band at 5635.5  of c@xmath11(0,1 )",
    "is shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : cmol1 ] .",
    "@xcite showed that the c@xmath11 emission bands are prominently seen only in unpolarized light .",
    "the negligible polarization for the c@xmath11 swan emission bands has also reported by the study of @xcite with a much higher - resolution spectropolarimetry , suggesting that the observed c@xmath11 emission may come directly from the line forming region .",
    "we confirm the presence of molecular absorption bands of the c@xmath11 phillips system and the cn red system , as shown in figure [ fig : cmol2 ] .",
    "the detection of these molecular absorption bands had previously been reported by @xcite .",
    "additionally , some of the features in c@xmath11 phillips ( 2,0 ) and ( 3,0 ) bands are shown in emission , whose central wavelength is less blue shifted than the corresponding absorption component .",
    "a few transitions in the cn ( 2,0 ) band also appear to show emission components .",
    "@xcite have suggested the presence of the merrill - sanford bands of sic@xmath11 in absorption , strongest at 4977  , particularly in the region of the nebular lobe .",
    "our spectrum does not show this feature in agreement with the apparent lack of this feature in the study of the central region of crl 2688 made by @xcite .",
    "all lines are shifted in velocity relative to the photospheric one.,width=302 ]        [ cols=\"^ \" , ]          is taken as a mean of [ y / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] , while [ ba / y ] ratio is used as a proxy of [ hs / ls ] .",
    "for the data obtained by @xcite ( gray crosses ) , the definition from the original paper is used for both quantities . , width=302 ]",
    "the radial velocities of the molecular lines provide an estimation of the velocity of the circumstellar outflow where these lines are formed .",
    "the emission components of the c@xmath11 phillips bands have a mean radial velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath10 with respect to the photospheric atomic absorption lines , while the emission components of the h@xmath23 , ( e1 ) and lines have a similar value of @xmath24 km s@xmath10 . for the absorption components of the c@xmath11 phillips bands ,",
    "this value is @xmath25 km s@xmath10 , which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath26 km s@xmath10 derived from the cn red system .",
    "existence of several velocity components of circumstellar outflows in a range 19 - 100 km s@xmath10 have been identified based on co and @xmath27co observations at radio wavelengths @xcite .    in the circumstellar environment , these molecules are thought to form from more complex molecules like c@xmath11h@xmath11 and hcn that are photodissociated by interstellar and/or stellar radiation fields .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that these molecules are confined to a thin circumstellar shell whose inner and outer radius are determined by the penetration / shields of photons from the radiation fields @xcite .",
    "the presence of both absorption and emission components in c@xmath11 phillips bands suggests complex geometric structure of this circumstellar shell in which c@xmath11 and cn can exist .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity differences between these components indicate that the regions where the absorption components of the c@xmath11 and cn bands arise are expanding faster than those for the emission components",
    ".      the enhanced c , n and na abundances seen in crl 2688 are indicative of dredge - up and mixing of h and he burning products during the agb phase of evolution . in this process , freshly synthesized s - process elements are also expected to be dredged - up , giving rise to overabundance in s - process elements in the photosphere .",
    "indeed a class of carbon - enriched post - agb stars are known to be enhanced with s - process elements @xcite .",
    "however , not all of them show this enhancement and some stars show depression in the s - process elements instead .",
    "the origin of this diversity in s - process abundance patterns is not well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical models for the generation of s - process elements during the agb evolution depends strongly on the parametrization of unknown factors such as a @xmath27c pocket , which may control neutron exposure @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the s - process efficiency depends on progenitor metallicity .",
    "@xcite found a strong correlation of [ hs / ls ] index with the overall s - process elemental abundance ( [ s / fe ] ) for their sample of carbon - rich post - agb stars .",
    "they have suggested that the observed variation in the s - process elemental abundance patterns can partly be explained by agb models with varying strength of the @xmath27c pocket .",
    "the observed low [ ba / y ] , treated as a proxy of [ hs / ls ] , appears to follow the suggested [ hs / ls]-[s / fe ] relation but with the lowest estimate of [ hs / ls ] , which is lower than typical theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a neutron source of @xmath28ne(@xmath23,n)@xmath29 mg , which would operate in rather massive agb stars , might be responsible for the observed abundance pattern .",
    "if this is the case , the progenitor may be a star with more than 3 or 4 solar masses .",
    "however this would be in contradiction with the observed c - rich nature of the circumstellar envelope of crl 2688 .",
    "note that the abundance result suggests that c / o@xmath301 from the photospheric absorption lines .",
    "however , the oxygen lines may be influenced by non - lte effects .",
    "if we apply non - lte correction to oxygen abundance the c / o ratio my be 1.0 or more .",
    "since only y and ba have reliably been estimated in the present work , the conclusion about the very low [ hs / ls ] remains to be confirmed .",
    "further accurate abundance study with much higher resolution and high signal to ratio spectrum may enable us to understand nucleosynthesis in the progenitor star .",
    "we have presented the analysis of a high - resolution optical spectrum of crl 2688 . based on the one - dimensional lte abundance analysis , we have confirmed that the central star has a spectral type of a f - type supergiant with [ fe / h]@xmath3 .",
    "molecular absorptions from c@xmath11 phillips , c@xmath11 swan bands and cn red system , that are presumably of circumstellar origin have been identified , some of which appear in emission . in particular ,",
    "c@xmath11 phillips band show presence of emission components with the helio - centric radial velocity offsetted from the photospheric absorption lines by @xmath31 km s@xmath10 , which is consistent with emission components seen also in the h@xmath23 line , and resonance lines ( @xmath24 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the absorption components of these lines have a mean radial velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath10 with respect to the photospheric absorption lines , and are more highly blueshifted than the corresponding emission components .",
    "the abundance pattern of crl2688 is characterized by the enhancement of c , n , na and y. however , unlike other known c - rich post agb stars , this object shows a very low [ ba / y ] ratio . since only abundances of ba and y have been reliably measured as a tracer of heavy and light s - process elements , respectively , in the present work , the conclusion about the peculiar [ hs / ls ] ratio observed in crl 2688 remains to be confirmed with measurements of more heavy and light s - process elements .",
    "higher resolution and higher signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy is required for more comprehensive understanding of the origin of the each spectral feature and the detailed abundance pattern .",
