    "_ ab initio _ calculation of dielectric response properties of materials are routinely performed using methods based upon density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite most of these calculations presently are based upon the so - called modern theory of polarization which is based upon a berry - phase ( bp ) interpretation of macroscopic polarization of solids.@xcite the practical implementation of the bp approach within various versions of the dft , such as the local - density approximation ( lda ) , is straightforward because of their mean - field nature .",
    "however , it is desirable to go beyond the mean - field level , so as to compute the influence of electron correlation effects on polarization properties such as the born charge of crystals .",
    "recently , we have proposed an approach which allows computation of various polarization properties of crystalline insulators within a many - body framework.@xcite the approach utilizes a wannier - function based real - space methodology , coupled with a finite - field approach , to perform correlated calculations using a bethe - goldstone - like many - body hierarchy .",
    "its successful implementation was demonstrated by performing _",
    "ab initio _ many - body calculations of born charges,@xcite and optical dielectric constants,@xcite of various insulating crystals .",
    "we note that an _ ab initio _ wave - functional - based real - space correlated approach has recently been successfully demonstrated by hozoi _",
    "_ et al.__@xciteto compute the quasi - particle band structure of crystalline mgo .",
    "in this paper we apply our recently - developed approach,@xcite to perform _ ab initio _ correlated calculations of born charges of crystalline li@xmath0o and licl .",
    "li@xmath0o is a technologically important material with possible applications in thermonuclear reactors,@xcite as also in solid - state batteries.@xcite based upon their infrared reflectivity and raman scattering based experiment on li@xmath0o , osaka and shindo@xcite reported the value of effective charge of li ions to be in the range 0.580.61 , a value much smaller compared to the nominal value of unity expected in an ionic material .",
    "therefore , they speculated whether the nature of chemical bond in the substance is partly covalent.@xcite in this work we present a careful investigation of this subject , and resolve the controversy by showing that the effective charge reported by osaka and shindo@xcite was the szigeti charge and not the born charge .",
    "once the born charge is computed from the szigeti charge , its experimental value 0.95 is in excellent agreement with our theoretical value of 0.91 , and much closer to the nominal value .",
    "we also present a plot of the wannier functions in the substance as also the mulliken population analysis to confirm the ionic bonding in li@xmath0o .",
    "as far as licl is concerned , earlier we computed its born charge at the hartree - fock level using our wannier function methodology,@xcite and found its value to be significantly smaller as compared to the experiments .",
    "therefore , in this work , we perform correlated calculations of the born charge of licl , and , indeed , obtain much better agreement with the experiments .",
    "remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ method ]",
    "we briefly describe the theoretical aspects of our wannier - function - based methodology .",
    "next in section [ results ] we present and discuss the results of our calculations . finally , in section [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the born effective charge tensor , @xmath1 , associated with the atoms of the @xmath2-th sublattice , is defined as@xcite@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the charge associated with the nuclei ( or the core ) of the sublattice , @xmath5 is the volume of the unit cell , @xmath6 is magnitude of the electronic charge , and @xmath7 is the @xmath8-th cartesian component of the electronic part of the macroscopic polarization induced as a result of the displacement of the sublattice in the @xmath9-th cartesian direction , @xmath10 . for small @xmath10 , one assumes @xmath11 , with @xmath12 computed as the change in the electronic polarization per unit cell due to the displacement @xmath10 . for a given lattice configuration denoted by parameter @xmath13 , we demonstrated that @xmath14 , for a many - electron system , can be computed as the expectation value@xcite@xmath15 @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the electronic charge , @xmath18 , represents the total number of unit cells in the crystal , @xmath19 is the @xmath8-th component of the many - electron position operator for the @xmath20 electrons of the crystal , and @xmath21 represents the correlated ground - state wave - function of the infinite solid , expressed in terms of wannier functions . for one - electron models such as kohn - sham theory , or the hartree - fock method , we showed@xcite that eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) leads to expressions consistent with the berry - phase - based theory of king - smith and vanderbilt@xcite , and resta@xcite .    calculating the expectation value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) can be tedious for a general correlated wave function .",
    "we avoid this by using the finite - field approach whereby the expectation values of various components of dipole operator can be obtained by performing both the hf and correlated calculations in presence of a small electric field in that direction , and then computing the first derivative of the computed total energy with respect to the applied electric field.@xcite this approach of computing expectation values derives its legitimacy from the generalized hellman - feynman theorem , and is called `` finite - field method '' in quantum chemistry literature.@xcite therefore , the present set of hf and correlated calculations are distinct from our previous ones@xcite in that the present calculations have been performed in presence of an external electric field . for details related to our wannier - function - based hf methodology ,",
    "in the presence of external electric fields , we refer the reader to our earlier papers.@xcite    correlation contributions to the energy per unit cell @xmath22 , even in the presence of external electric fields , were computed according to the incremental scheme of stoll@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 etc .",
    "are respectively the one- , two- and three - body@xmath25 correlation increments obtained by considering simultaneous virtual excitations from one , two , or three occupied wannier functions , and @xmath26 label the wannier functions involved.@xcite because of the translational symmetry , one of these @xmath27 wannier functions is required to be in the reference unit cell , while the remaining ones can be anywhere else in the solid . in our previous studies performed on ionic systems , we demonstrated that the increments can be truncated to two - body effects ( @xmath28 , with the wannier functions not being farther than the third - nearest neighbors.@xcite we follow the same truncation scheme here as well , with the method of correlation calculation being the full - configuration - interaction ( fci ) as in our previous works , where other technical details related to the approach are also described.@xcite",
    "in this section , first we present the results of our calculations of born charges of li@xmath0o , followed by those of licl .",
    "the primitive cell of li@xmath0o consists of a three - atom basis ( two li and one o ) , with each atom belonging to an fcc lattice . in our calculations anion",
    "was placed at the origin of the primitive cell , while the cations were located at the positions @xmath29 .",
    "this structure is usually referred to as the anti - fluorite structure , to which other related materials such as na@xmath0o and k@xmath0o also belong .",
    "based upon intuition , one would conclude that the bonding in the substance will be of ionic type , with the valence @xmath30 electrons of the two lithium atoms of the formula unit being transferred to the oxygen .",
    "thus the two li atoms will be in cationic state while the oxygen will be in dianionic state .",
    "however , the argument for partial covalence in the system goes as follows .",
    "it is well - known that the free o@xmath31 ions do not exist in nature .",
    "therefore , in lithium oxide it will be stabilized only because of the crystal - field effects . still , one could argue , that o@xmath31 ion in solid state will be very diffuse , leading to partial covalency . in light of these arguments",
    ", it is interesting to examine the results of the experiments of osaka and shindo@xcite performed on the single crystals of li@xmath0o , where they measured the frequencies of fundamental optical and raman active modes using infrared and raman spectroscopy .",
    "using the measured frequencies and several other parameters , the authors fitted their data both to rigid - ion and shell models of lattice dynamics , to obtain values for li effective charges of 0.58 and 0.61,@xcite respectively . noting that the obtained effective charge is quite different from the nominal value of unity",
    ", they argued that the result suggests that li@xmath0o has partially covalent character.@xcite next , we argue , however , that the effective charge reported by osaka and shindo is actually the szigeti charge,@xcite and not the born charge .",
    "the shell - model value of 0.61 of the effective charge of li was computed by osaka and shindo@xcite using the expression for the fluorite structure derived by axe@xcite@xmath32^{1/2}\\frac{3\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\infty}}}{\\epsilon_{\\infty+2}},\\label{eq : szigeti}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are the longitudinal / transverse optical phonon frequencies , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the lattice constant , @xmath36 is the effective mass of the three ion system , while @xmath37 is the high - frequency dielectric constant of the material .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "[ eq : szigeti ] is nothing but the szigeti charge@xcite of the ion from which the born charge ( @xmath38 ) can be computed using the relation@xcite@xmath39    if we use the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 obtained by osaka and shindo@xcite in eq .",
    "[ eq : born - szigeti ] , we obtain the experimental value of born charge of li ions in li@xmath0o to be @xmath42 which is very close to the nominal value of unity . from this",
    ", the experimental value of the born charge of the o ions can be deduced to be @xmath43 .",
    "these values of the born charges of li and o ions imply , in the most unequivocal manner , an ionic structure for li@xmath0o consistent with the intuition , without any possibility of covalency .",
    "next , we report the results of our _ ab initio _ correlated calculations of born charges of bulk li@xmath0o .",
    "these calculations were performed using the lobe - type gaussian basis functions which , as demonstrated in the past , represent cartesian gaussian basis functions to a very good accuracy.@xcite as in our previous hf study of the ground state properties of li@xmath0o,@xcite our calculations were initiated by a smaller basis set reported by dovesi _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite consisting of @xmath44 functions for lithium , and @xmath45 functions for oxygen",
    ". however , we also augmented our basis set by a single @xmath46-type exponent of 0.8 , recommended also by dovesi _",
    "et al._,@xcite so as to check the influence of higher angular momentum functions on our results .",
    "henceforth , we refer to these two basis sets as @xmath47 and @xmath48 basis sets , respectively . for the purpose of the calculations , fcc geometry along with the experimentally extrapolated @xmath49 lattice constant value of @xmath50@xcite",
    "was assumed . for our finite - field approach to born charge described earlier , electric fields of strength @xmath51 atomic units ( a.u . ) , along with an oxygen lattice displacement @xmath52 , both in the @xmath53direction , were used .",
    "this leads to the determination of @xmath54 component of the born charge corresponding to the oxygen lattice . during the correlated calculations ,",
    "wannier functions corresponding to @xmath55 functions of both li and o were held frozen , while virtual excitations were carried out from the @xmath30 and @xmath56 orbitals of oxygen anion . at the hf level we verified that the symmetry relation @xmath57 holds , along with the fact that the off - diagonal elements of the born charge tensor are negligible .",
    "additionally , the optical sum rule @xmath58 , was also verified .",
    "our calculated results for the born charge of oxygen in li@xmath0o are presented in table [ tab - born - li2o ] .",
    "it is obvious from the table that irrespective of the basis set used , most of the contribution to the born charge , as expected , is obtained at the hf level , with relatively smaller contribution of electron - correlation effects .",
    "correlation effects do diminish the value of the born charge as compared to its hf value , however , rather insignificantly .",
    "comparatively , speaking the inclusion of one @xmath59type basis function on oxygen has greater influence on the born charge of oxygen , and its value is increased as compared to the one obtained using the @xmath47 basis set . with the @xmath48 basis set , we found negligible influence on the born charge from the two - body contributions outside of the reference unit cell .",
    "thus our calculations , as per optical sum rule , predict a value of born charge of li to be close to 0.91 , in very good agreement with the experimental results,@xcite with the error being less than 5% . in order to obtain a pictorial view of electronic structure in the material , in fig .",
    "[ fig - wan ] we plot one of the oxygen @xmath56 valence wannier functions , computed using the @xmath48 basis set , along the @xmath60 direction . to simulate the effect of one of the phonon modes , we displaced the oxygen atom of the primitive cell to the position @xmath61 , where @xmath35 is the lattice constant , leaving the li atoms undisturbed . from the figure it is obvious that the wannier function is highly localized around the oxygen site , with small value in the interatomic region , implying the ionic character of the material .",
    ".correlated values of born charge of li@xmath0o obtained in our calculations .",
    "column with heading hf refers to results obtained at the hartree - fock level . heading `` one - body '' refers to results obtained after including the corrections due to `` one - body '' excitations from each wannier function of the unit cell , to the hf value .",
    "two - body ( o ) implies results include additional corrections due to simultaneous excitations from two distinct wannier functions located on the anion in the reference unit cell .",
    "two - body ( 1nn ) and two - body ( 2nn ) correspond to two - body correlation effects involving 1st and 2nd , nearest neighbor wannier functions , respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath62computed from the experimental data reported in reference .",
    "@xcite    [ tab - born - licl ]    the results of our calculations are presented in table [ tab - born - licl ] . with our @xmath47 basis set the correlation effects",
    "were included up to the level of two - body increments involving the wannier functions in the nearest - neighboring cells .",
    "however , with the augmented @xmath48 basis set , inclusion of two - body increments beyond the reference unit cell , did not make any significant difference to the results .",
    "similar to the case of , li@xmath0o , we note that : ( a ) inclusion of one @xmath46-type function improves the results both at the hf and the correlated levels , and ( b ) the inclusion of electron - correlation effects generally improves the results as compared to the hf values .",
    "the final value of born charge of licl of 1.178 obtained from these calculations , is again in very good agreement with the experimental value , with an error smaller than 5% .",
    "in conclusion , we performed wannier - function - based _ ab initio _ correlated calculations on crystalline li@xmath0o and licl to compute their born effective charges , using a methodology recently developed in our group .",
    "calculations were performed using polarizable basis sets , and the results obtained were in very good agreement with the experimental ones . additionally , we also resolved an ambiguity associated with rather small value of experimentally measured effective charge of li@xmath0o , which had raised the possibility of partial covalence in its chemical structure,@xcite by demonstrating that the measured charge was the szigeti charge , and not the born charge of the compound .",
    "the born charge obtained from the szigeti charge was found to be in good agreement with its nominal ionic value . by further computing the mulliken charges and exploring the wannier functions",
    ", we demonstrated that the results were consistent with a ionic picture of li@xmath0o .",
    "the computational effort involved in our calculations is significant heavier than in the calculations performed using the density - functional theory .",
    "this is because our approach is many - body in nature , requiring calculations beyond the mean - field . at present",
    "we are exploring the possibility of using our approach to compute the born charges of ferroelectric , as well as covalent materials , and we will publish our results in future as and when they become available ."
