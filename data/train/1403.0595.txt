    "the most recent determination of the primordial he mass fraction provides an initial value @xmath10=  0.254@xmath10.003 @xcite .    the study of the he content of stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) is still a challenging task but it is crucial for a number of aspects of the stellar astrophysics .",
    "first of all , the he content in galactic gc stars is thought to be a good tracer of the primordial he abundance because these are among the first generations of stars formed in the universe and the mixing episodes occurring during their evolution only marginally affect their surface he abundance @xcite .",
    "moreover , the he content is usually invoked as one of the possible _ second parameter _ ( together with age , cno / fe ratio , stellar density ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , to explain the observed distribution of stars along the horizontal branch ( hb ) , being the overall metallicity the first parameter .",
    "finally , observational evidence reveal the presence of multiple stellar generations in gcs , formed in short timescales ( @xmath11100 myr ) after the initial star - formation burst , from a pristine gas polluted by the products of hot proton - capture processes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , these new stars are expected to be characterized by ( mild or extreme ) he enhancement with respect to the first ones , together with enhancement of na and al , and depletion of o and mg .",
    "despite such an importance , however , the intrinsic difficulties in the derivation of he abundances in low - mass stars have prevented a detailed and systematic investigation of he in gcs .",
    "only few photospheric he transitions are available in the blue - optical spectral range ( @xmath125900 @xmath0 ) and they are visible only at high effective temperatures ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , he lines in gc stars can be detected only among the hb stars hotter than @xmath119000 k ( the precise boundary also depends on the available signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra , snr ) .    instead , the measure of the he abundance in fgk - type stars is limited only to the use of the chromospheric line at 10830 @xmath0 , while no photospheric he line is available in these stars .",
    "unfortunately , this transition is extremely weak and very high snr and spectral resolution are required for a proper measurement .",
    "moreover , the precise he abundance heavily depends on the modeling of the chromosphere .",

    "@xcite point out a y difference of at least 0.17 between the two stars .",
    "a similar difference has been suggested by @xcite for giants in omega centauri .    a further complication in the measurement of the he abundance in hb stars is provided by diffusion processes , like radiative levitation and gravitational settling , occurring in the radiative atmospheres of hb stars hotter than @xmath1111000 - 12000 k , corresponding to the so - called _ grundahl jump _ @xcite .",

    "all the model atmospheres have been computed under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and one - dimensional , plane - parallel geometry .",
    "we checked the impact of the use of atlas9 and atlas12 models on the derived he abundance .",
    "for y around the standard value ( y@xmath110.25 ) the two models provide the same result , while for he - enhanced stars ( at least up to y@xmath110.3 ) , the adoption of atlas9 models under - estimates y of about 0.02 .",
    "on the other hand , for stars with surface he mass fraction of @xmath110.10 , analysis based on the standard atlas9 models overestimate y by @xmath110.05 .    despite the analyzed he transition can suffer for departures from lte conditions ( relevant for b - type stars ) , this effect is negligible considering the atmospheric parameters and the metallicities of our targets ( p. bonifacio , private communication ) .",
    "the total uncertainty for each star is derived by adding in quadrature the uncertainty in the fitting procedure and that arising from the adopted parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitting procedure has been estimated by using montecarlo simulations .",
    "for observed spectra , the uncertainty associated to a @xmath17-minimization can not be estimated by using the @xmath17 theorems , that assume that all the pixels are not correlated each other ( see e.g. the discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , in observed spectra the adjacent pixels can not be considered as independent each other because of the re - binning procedure during the wavelength calibration . for each star",
    ", we computed a set of 1000 synthetic spectra , calculated with the appropriate atmospheric parameters , rotational velocities and the best - fit he abundance .",
    "each montecarlo spectrum has been obtained by rebinning the best - fit synthetic spectrum to the same pixel - size of the giraffe spectra ( 0.05 @xmath0/pixel ) and then by injecting poissonian noise , in order to reproduce the snr of each star around the he line .",
    "thus , this set of synthetic spectra is equivalent to the real one but with the he abundances known a priori .",
    "this method allows to take into account simultaneously the main sources of uncertainty in the line fitting , namely the finite size of the pixels , the snr and the continuum estimate .",
    "the same analysis performed for the observed spectra has been done for the synthetic ones and the dispersion of the derived y abundance distribution has been assumed as 1@xmath2 uncertainty in the fitting procedure .",
    "these uncertainties depend on the injected snr , but also on the line strength ( thus the temperature and the he abundance ) and the rotational velocity . typical errors in he mass fraction range from 0.01 up 0.05 .",
    "because we are interested in possible star - to - star variations of the he content , we estimated the internal uncertainties due to the atmospheric parameters .",
    "the total error obtained by adding in quadrature the uncertainties due to the individual atmospheric parameters is an upper limit of the internal error , because it does not take into account the covariance terms occurring among the parameters . in order to take into account the effect of the projection process on the derived @xmath13 and log  g",

    "note also that these uncertainties do not represent the total error budget in the adopted parameters , but only the internal star - to - star uncertainty related to the adopted procedure in the parameter derivation .    only to provide the general variation of y due to this procedure , an uncertainty of @xmath1100 k in @xmath13 ( coupled with the corresponding variation in gravity of @xmath10.02 )",
    "provides a variation in y of @xmath10.01 for the hottest stars ( @xmath1111000 k ) and of @xmath10.02 for the coldest targets ( @xmath119000 k ) , whereas the impact of microturbulent velocity is totally negligible .",
    "the error in @xmath15sini ( typically 2 - 3 km / s ) provides a contribution at a level of less than 0.005 .",
    "note that the 4471 @xmath0 he line used in this work is slightly less sensitive to the adopted atmospheric parameters with respect to the line at 5875 @xmath0 , adopted in the other papers where the he abundance in gc stars is derived .",
    "finally , systematic effects can be due to the choice of the zahb model .",
    "as extensively discussed by @xcite , a possible source of systematic errors is the he abundance of the used zahb .",
    "the he abundance of our targets is not known a priori , thus we derived the atmospheric parameters adopting zahb models computed with standard y. the adoption of a y - enhanced zahb leads to a decrease of gravity by @xmath110.1 - 0.15 , with a negligible impact on the temperature .",
    "note that a systematic decrease of 0.1 in log  g ( keeping @xmath13 fixed ) implies an increase of the derived y smaller than 0.02/0.03 . as discussed in section [ content ]",
    ", the adoption of the standard he content for the used zahb models is reasonable in light of the derived he content of our targets , thus we do not need to re - derive the atmospheric parameters by using zahb models computed with higher y. a similar effect is obtained if we consider that the stars leaving the zahb locus will be more luminous and with a lower gravity ( but basically the same temperature ) with respect to the zahb position .",

    "all the stars have y around @xmath110.24 - 0.25 , with the exception of one star in m30 and two stars in ngc6397 , that show very low ( y@xmath120.1 ) he abundance .",
    "the three stars with low he content also show iron abundances higher than that of the parent cluster @xcite . this behavior is commonly observed in hb stars hotter than the _ grundahl jump _ @xcite and it",
    "is predicted by theoretical models @xcite as an effect of radiative levitation ( responsible for the metal enhancement ) and gravitational settling ( responsible for the he depletion ) .",
    "we note that some stars with similar @xmath13 to those of the he - poor stars , but with normal y , are detected .",
    "this difference can be due to the fact that we observe the region close to the _ grundahl jump _ and not all the stars have still undergone the diffusion processes .",
    "interestingly enough , one star in ngc2808 with a temperature higher than that of the _ grundahl jump _ does not show any evidence of he depletion @xcite .    excluding the three fe - rich and he - poor stars , we find average he mass fractions of y=0.252@xmath10.005 ( @xmath2=0.021 ) for m30 and y=0.241@xmath10.004 ( @xmath2=0.023 ) for ngc6397 .",

    "therefore , the derived he abundances of hb stars in m30 and ngc6397 are totally compatible with the expectations for low - mass evolved stars formed with a primordial he abundance ( @xmath10=  0.254 , * ? ? ?",

    "the observed y values among the stars of each target gc are compatible within the uncertainties .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the two gcs are not strongly enriched in he , displaying a substantial he uniformity : only small ( if any ) y variations could be present in their stellar content .",
    "this result agrees with the analysis of ngc6397 by @xcite , based on the width of the observed main sequence ( ms ) , that predicts a maximum internal variation of @xmath110.02 in the y distribution of the cluster ms stars .",

    "again , this is fully consistent with our results . concerning m30 , no study so far has revealed splitting or anomalous broadening of the ms , suggesting a small or null intrinsic dispersion in the he content of this cluster , in agreement with our findings .",

    "as a sanity check , we roughly divided the y abundances of ngc6397 in two samples , corresponding to [ o / fe ] lower and higher than the solar value , finding @xmath12y@xmath14=  0.258@xmath10.005 ( @xmath2=  0.015 ) and @xmath12y@xmath14=  0.233@xmath10.005 ( @xmath2=  0.022 ) , respectively . this small difference (",
    "formally compatible with the results by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) corresponds to a 3.5@xmath2 detection .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test provides a @xmath111% probability that the y abundances of the stars with sub - solar [ o / fe ] abundances are extracted from the same population as the stars with [ o / fe]@xmath140.0 .",
    "we have analysed the he mass fraction y for a sample of 24 and 35 hb stars in m30 and ngc6397 , respectively .",
    "the main results are : _",
    "( i ) _ both clusters have an average he content compatible with the primordial he abundance ( @xmath12y@xmath14=0.252@xmath10.003 for m30 and @xmath12y@xmath14=0.241@xmath10.004 for ngc6397 ) and they are not strongly enriched in he ; _",
    "( ii ) _ a weak ( but statistically significant ) anticorrelation between y and [ o / fe ] among the hb stars of ngc6397 does exist ( but it is not detected in m30 ) .",
    "we suggest that the o - poor , he - rich stars found in the hb of ngc6397 belong to the second stellar generation of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately na abundances are not available for these stars . in principle , y-[o / fe ] anti - correlation is expected in all the gcs displaying the chemical signatures of the self - enrichment processes , even if its very small slope makes its detection very hard .",
    "the lack of y-[o / fe ] anti - correlation for the stars in m30 can be due to several causes , mainly the size of our sample ( three times smaller than that secured for ngc6397 ) and the snr of the spectra ( lower than that of the spectra of ngc6397 ) .",
    "also , we can not rule out that m30 has undergone a self - enrichment process less efficient with respect to ngc6397 , as suggested by their different [ o / fe ] distributions ( in fact m30 shows a lack of stars with [ o / fe]@xmath120 , instead detected among the stars of ngc6397 ) .",
    "thus , the internal variation of the he content in the stellar population of m30 could be smaller than 0.01 .    the y-[o / fe ] anti - correlation observed in ngc6397 seems to confirm the theoretical expectations that the gc stars born after the first burst of star formation are both depleted in o and ( mildly ) enriched in he , demonstrating that the stars usually labelled as _",
    "second generation stars _ show the signatures of hot - temperature proton - capture processes , with a simultaneous o - depletion and a weak he enrichment .",
