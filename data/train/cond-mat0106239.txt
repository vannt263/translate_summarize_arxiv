    "the recent discovery@xcite of superconductivity at @xmath4k in the simple intermetallic compound mgb@xmath0 is particularly interesting for many reasons . in the first instance , this critical temperature is by far the highest if we exclude oxides and c@xmath5 based materials .",
    "furthermore , b isotope effect@xcite suggests that mgb@xmath0  is a bcs phonon - mediated superconductor , with @xmath6 above the commonly accepted limits for phonon - assisted superconductivity .",
    "another reason of interest is that the alb@xmath0-type structure of mgb@xmath0   ( which can be viewed as an intercalated graphite structure with full occupation of interstitial sites centered in hexagonal prisms made of b atoms ) is shared by a large class of compounds ( more than one hundred ) , where the b site can be occupied by si or ge , but also by ni , ga , cu , ag , au , zn and cd , and mg can be substituted by divalent or trivalent @xmath7 metals , transition elements or rare earths . such a variety is therefore particularly suggestive of a systematic study of diborides and structurarly related compounds . to confirm this interest ,",
    "a recent study@xcite showed that superconductivity is supressed by addition of more than about 30% of al atoms .",
    "pressure effects@xcite also lead to a depression of superconductivity .",
    "early studies@xcite of the electronic structure of diborides by the opw and tight - binding methods have shown similarity with graphite bands . a more systematic study of @xmath8type compounds@xcite by the full - potential lapw method showed in simple metal diborides the presence of interlayer states , similar to those previously found in graphite@xcite , in addition to graphite  like @xmath3 and @xmath9 bands",
    ". transition metal diborides , on the other hand , show a more complex band structure due to the metal @xmath10 states .",
    "a very recent electronic structure calculation@xcite on mgb@xmath0   shows that metallicity is due to b states .",
    "phonon frequencies and electron - phonon couplings ( at the @xmath11 point ) lead these authors to suggest phonon - based superconductivity .",
    "further , new calculations@xcite on related compounds ( @xmath12 and graphitic - like b ) addressed the peculiar contributions to conductivity coming from the interplay of 2d and 3d fermi surface features .",
    "an alternative mechanism has been proposed by hirsch@xcite , based on dressed hole carriers in the b planes , in the presence of almost filled bands .",
    "recently , superconductivity at @xmath13k was observed in @xmath14@xcite . in this compound ,",
    "high pressure has been effectively used to tune both structural and physical properties@xcite . in particular , bordet and co - workers",
    "@xcite identified a new structural phase transition for @xmath14 from trigonal to hexagonal @xmath8-type structure , with superconductivity at @xmath15 , one of the highest transition temperatures known for a silicon based compound .",
    "the occurrence of this structural phase transition indicates that si shifts from an @xmath16 to an @xmath17-like hybridization , and experiment points to a clear enhancement of @xmath6 with high pressure@xcite .",
    "many electronic structure studies have been carried out for the different phases@xcite of disilicides .",
    "@xmath14 in the @xmath8 structure was studied by kusakabe et al.@xcite , but a final answer on the stability of this phase under pressure is still lacking .    as previously pointed out",
    ", the @xmath8 family of compounds provides a wide playground for the search of new superconductors , and we intend to provide here a contribution , based on a detailed study of electronic and structural properties together with phonon spectra , for several diborides and for @xmath14 , in the trigonal and hexagonal structures .",
    "the questions that we want to address are the following : ( i ) how do the electronic properties of mx@xmath0 depend on the atomic species m ; namely , can rigid band schemes provide the correct trend , or is the metal effect mostly mediated by lattice parameter changes ( chemical pressure ) .",
    "( ii ) ref . shows the presence of both b @xmath9 fermi surfaces ( fs ) giving rise to 3-dimensional states , and of small 2-dimensional b @xmath3-bonding pockets .",
    "it is of course interesting to know which of the fs is mostly involved in superconductivity .",
    "the trends observed in the band structures , together with experimental studies , will contribute to elucidate this point .",
    "in the same way , changes in the fermi level density of states with chemical composition will possibly correlate with @xmath6 values .",
    "( iii ) pure casi@xmath0   shows a trigonal instability , joined by a buckling of si@xmath0 planes , which is apparently@xcite strongly reduced under high pressure , or by be substituting some of the si sites .",
    "the presence , or the proximity , of structural instabilities ( investigated through phonon spectra ) , will hopefully provide hints to further experimental search for new materials .    in this paper , we present calculations for mgb@xmath0 , @xmath1 , beb@xmath0 , casi@xmath0  and @xmath18  ( @xmath19 ) , based on the local density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory .",

    "the local density approximation to the exchange - correlation functional is used .",
    "plane wave cutoffs of 44 ry and 30 ry were found sufficient to converge structural and electronic properties of the diborides and silicides respectively .",

    "the structure used in the lrt calculations was obtained optimizing the lattice structure up to a residual stress of 1 mpa .",
    "we shall start our discussion of electronic properties of diborides by presenting in fig .",
    "[ bande_mg ] the energy bands of the superconducting compound mgb@xmath0 , which will be the reference for all our further studies ( the @xmath37 lines are in the basal plane , while the @xmath38 lines are the corresponding ones on the top plane at @xmath39 ) .",
    "we used the experimental lattice parameters @xmath40  , @xmath41  .",
    "our results , which are in excellent agreement with those of kortus et .",
    "al.@xcite , show strong similarities with the band structures of most simple - metal diborides@xcite , computed by the flapw method .",
    "they show strongly bonded @xmath17 hybrids laying in the horizontal hexagonal planes , forming the three lowest ( @xmath3bonding ) bands , as the main structure in the valence region .",
    "the corresponding antibonding combinations are located around 6 ev above the fermi level ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the bonding along the vertical direction is provided by the @xmath9 bands ( at @xmath42 -3 ev and @xmath42 2 at @xmath11 ) , forming the double bell - shaped structures . similarly to @xmath8-type diborides , and",
    "unlike graphite , we notice a large dispersion of the @xmath9 bands along the @xmath43 direction ( @xmath44 ) . this can be understood on a tight - binding approach : the phases of the bloch functions lead the b @xmath45 orbitals on adjacent layers to be antibonding at @xmath11 , and bonding at @xmath46 .",
    "the downwards dispersion of the @xmath9-bonding band ( from @xmath47 to @xmath48 ev along @xmath44 ) is joined by an opposite upwards dispersion of an empty band , ( at @xmath49  ev at the @xmath11 point ) .",
    "the analysis of the wavefunctions for this empty band reveals that this band has an interstitial character , and is very similar to those found in graphite@xcite , in diborides@xcite , in caga@xmath0@xcite , but also in casi@xmath0 .",
    "a general description of the bonding can be given by the partial density of states ( pdos ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ dosmg ] .",
    "the b pdos , in particular , shows bonding and antibonding structures for the @xmath50 and @xmath34 states .",
    "the @xmath45 states give rise to a rather wide structure responsible for less than half of the dos at @xmath32 , which therefore results having predominantly b @xmath51 character .    in the search of similar materials having the desired superconducting properties ,",
    "beb@xmath0  is the first natural candidate , as the band filling is expected to be pretty similar , and lighter be atoms may help providing larger phonon frequencies while keeping similar electronic properties .",
    "the first experimental report on beb@xmath0@xcite gives the average lattice constants .",
    "these experimental parameters have been used for all the previous calculations of the beb@xmath0@xcite .",
    "we have optimized the lattice constants , imposing the @xmath8  structure , obtaining @xmath52 , @xmath53 , smaller than in mgb@xmath0   and similar to the values estimated by the average experimental values . in particular",
    ", we notice that while @xmath54 reduces only by about 7.4% , @xmath55 reduces by about 24% when mg is substituted by be , a result which can be understood pretty easily . on one hand , in fact , the optimization of @xmath3-bonds prevents a too drastic variation of the @xmath54 parameter ; on the other hand , @xmath55 can change more easily as the vertical bonding , provided by the @xmath9 bands , has a large contribution from the metal orbitals .",
    "the band structure of beb@xmath0 , shown in fig  [ bande_beb2 ] , are pretty similar to those computed by the flapw method@xcite at the experimentally estimated lattice parameters .",
    "we can remark the strong similarities with the mgb@xmath0  compound , which includes the presence of @xmath3-bonding hole pockets along @xmath44 , but also a few relevant differences .",
    "first of all , the shorter lattice parameters lead to wider valence bands , and also to more dispersed @xmath3 bands , in particular the cylindrical hole pocket along @xmath44 , which might be relevant for superconductivity .",
    "also , the different energy location of the metal @xmath50free electron band ( lower in mgb@xmath0 ) , and the different shape of the @xmath9-bonding band ( related by the different @xmath55 values ) causes a different occupation of this band , especially along @xmath56 .    to further investigate these two materials , and their relation to isostructural diborides , we studied the zone center phonon frequencies of mgb@xmath0 , beb@xmath0 , and @xmath8 , using the linear response approach , with the pseudopotential method .",
    "the calculations have been carried out at the theoretical lattice constants ( also listed in table [ phonons ] ) , as obtained using the same method .",
    "the two lowest independent frequencies correspond to a motion of the intercalated metal atoms relative to the rigid b networks : one vertical mode ( @xmath57 ) , and one doubly degenerate in - plane mode , ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the two higher frequencies represent the internal motion of the b network itself : again one vertical mode ( @xmath59 ) , now representing a trigonal distortion producing a buckling of the planes similar to that found in casi@xmath0 , and one degenerate ( @xmath60 ) mode giving an in - plane stretching of b - b bonds .",
    "our calculations for mgb@xmath0  are in good with other results @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the mgb@xmath0  and beb@xmath0  shows a much higher @xmath60 frequency in beb@xmath0 .",
    "this result can not be explained through the different atomic masses , as it involves only b motion .",
    "it is therefore related to the different coupling of the electrons with the nuclear system .",
    "surprisingly , two of the remaining frequencies are lower in beb@xmath0 , namely the @xmath57 mode which involves the motion of lighter be atoms against the b network and the @xmath59 mode .",
    "this indicates a strong dependence of the phonon spectra of these materials on the electronic structure details .",
    "the lowest @xmath58 mode has comparable frequencies .",
    "if we now go to @xmath8 , we see again that the @xmath60 mode is much higher than in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , this mode has his minimum value in the superconducting material .",
    "the modes involving the relative motion of the b@xmath0 planes as a whole have frequencies comparable to the other materials ; the @xmath59 , on the other hand , is smaller than in mgb@xmath0  and beb@xmath0 , which is probably a consequence of the larger band filling ( see the discussion on casi@xmath0  below ) .",
    "we have computed , within a rigid band scheme and using the scheme described , e.g. , in ref .",
    ", the fermi velocities , plasma frequencies ( along the principal axes of the crystal ) , and the independent components of the hall tensor for beb@xmath0  and mgb@xmath0 .",
    "because of hexagonal symmetry , the non - zero components will be @xmath61 , corresponding to the magnetic field along the @xmath31 axis and transport in plane , and @xmath62 corresponding to in  plane magnetic field . the results , plotted in fig .",
    "[ trabemg ] as a function of the hole or electron - type doping , show relatively smooth variations over a wide range of doping , and are nearly coinciding , at zero doping , with the corresponding calculations by kortus et al.@xcite . after comparing the two materials ,",
    "the following remarks can be done : ( i ) the density of states at @xmath32 is smaller in beb@xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) mgb@xmath0  is nearly isotropic in terms of plasma frequencies and fermi velocities , while beb@xmath0  is expected to show important anisotropy in resistivity , and , in particular , the in - plane conductivity is expected to be smaller . a band - by - band decomposition explains these results in term of very similar ( and very anisotropic ) contributions in the two compounds from @xmath3 states , and quite different contributions from the @xmath9 bands , nearly isotropic in mgb@xmath0  and favoring conductivity along the @xmath55-axis in beb@xmath0 .",
    "these results point out that despite structural similarity , the electronic properties of @xmath8-type structures differ substantially from graphite and intercalation graphite compounds .",
    "( iii ) the hall coefficients are positive ( hole - like ) when the magnetic field is along the @xmath31 axis ( transport in",
    " plane ) , while is negative for mgb@xmath0  and almost zero but negative for beb@xmath0 , when the magnetic field is in  plane .",
    "a detailed analysis shows again comparable contributions in the two compounds from @xmath3 bands , while the sign of @xmath63 and @xmath64 comes from a balance of the @xmath9 bands .",
    "the hall coefficient of mgb@xmath0  has been recently measured by kang et al.@xcite .",
    "@xmath65 , which will correspond in this case to an average of the tensor components , turns out to be positive and to decrease with temperature . at @xmath66k they give @xmath67 , and an extrapolation of their results at @xmath68 , gives @xmath69 .",
    "if we average , at zero doping , our tensor components , the positive contributions overcome the negative ones , resulting in an average value @xmath70 .",
    "this value is thus of the correct order , but single crystal measurements are probably necessary to have a significant comparison , avoiding an average of quantities with different sign .",
    "it is worth noticing that , if the sign of carriers has a role on superconductivity@xcite , beb@xmath0 also has a positive hall coefficient .      a recent experimental report by slusky et al.@xcite shows that al doping destroys bulk superconductivity when the al content @xmath71 is greater than @xmath72 .",
    "stimulated by these results , we studied the chemical substitution of mg with al .",
    "the substitution corresponding to a 50% concentration of al ( @xmath73 ) leads to a reduction of the cell parameters , from @xmath40   , @xmath74  @xcite for mgb@xmath0 , to @xmath75   , @xmath76  @xcite for @xmath1 .",
    "these differences again indicate hardly compressible b - b @xmath3 bonds , and interlayer distances quite sensitive to the intercalated cation .",
    "the study of slusky et al.@xcite shows consistent results , and indicates , furthermore , that after a two - phases region for al substitutions from 10 to 25% , @xmath55 collapses and bulk superconductivity disappears .",
    "we first studied this problem in a rigid band approach , bringing mgb@xmath0  to the same lattice parameters of @xmath77@xcite .",
    "the only apparent change at that electron concentration is the complete filling of the @xmath9 bonding band at the @xmath78 point .",
    "the @xmath3 bonding bands need a larger electron addition to be completely filled in a rigid band model .    to investigate further this problem , we studied the system with 50% al concentration .",
    "we used in our calculations the experimental values , and in a first approach simulated the disorder ( certainly present in the real compound ) using an orthorhombic supercell .",
    "the corresponding unit cell contains two formula units , and is described by the two orthogonal in plane basis vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we started by calculating the energy bands using the mgb@xmath0  lattice constants , and then we used the experimental @xmath1  constants .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ mgal ] together with the bands of mgb@xmath0 , folded into the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the orthorhombic structure .",
    "the folding is such that the @xmath11 point of the orthorhombic bz corresponds to the @xmath11 and @xmath78 points of the hexagonal bz , while @xmath81 corresponds to both the hexagonal @xmath46 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath83 line collects the @xmath44 and the @xmath84 hexagonal lines , and we notice immediately the three @xmath9 bands ( two bonding and one anti - bonding , coming from folding ) .",
    "the @xmath85 line contains the ( folded ) hexagonal @xmath56 line . if we first look at the frozen structure calculation fig .",
    "[ mgal](c ) , we see quite similar band dispersions with the obvious splittings , related to the symmetry lowering induced by the different cations , and a different band filling .",
    "we notice , however , a lowering of the folded @xmath9 antibonding band , related to the different cations : the @xmath9 band is in fact pushed downwards by the interaction with the free - electron metal-@xmath50 band , which is at lower energy in the compounds with al ( this band is partially filled in pure , non superconducting , @xmath8@xcite ) . as a consequence , the extra electrons coming from al",
    "do not fill the @xmath3-bonding band completely , leaving hole pockets around @xmath81 .",
    "as we relax the structure , the @xmath3 bands increase their width due to the smaller @xmath54 value , and the situation near @xmath32 changes only because of the occupation of the free - electron band around @xmath11 .",
    "these results suggest that although the rigid band scheme can be considered roughly correct , the dependence upon doping of the physical properties and of fermi surface states relevant for superconductivity , may be crucially dependent on the actual substitutional atom .",
    "when prepared at ambient pressure @xmath14 has a rhombohedral structure ( space group @xmath86 , @xmath87  , @xmath88  ) @xcite and is a semimetal @xcite , not superconducting down to @xmath89  mk@xcite . by annealing under pressure - typical conditions",

    "table [ phonons ] shows that this system has lower phonon frequencies than the diborides , as is normal given the heavier atomic species involved .",

    "the following conclusions can be drawn on the basis of our calculations : as compared to mgb@xmath0 , beb@xmath0  has a similar filling of @xmath3 bands , but differs in terms of @xmath9 states near @xmath32 .",
    "the dos at @xmath32 is lower , and some phonon frequencies are substantialy higher while others are comparable or lower",
    ". it would be interesting to further investigate this compound .",
    "al substitution can not be fully simulated by a rigid band model , as the @xmath9 antibonding states appear to be quite sensitive to al substitution , and absorb much of the added electrons .",
    "transport properties show a substantial two - dimensionality of these compounds , due to @xmath9 states .",
    "we studied casi@xmath0  in its trigonal structure , and show that the distortion can be removed only by subtracting ( in a virtual crystal - like approximation ) at least @xmath118 electrons .",
