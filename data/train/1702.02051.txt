    "a substantial fraction of the measurements made of exoplanetary atmospheres takes the form of transmission spectra  scrutinizing the small change in the projected size of the exoplanet , across wavelength , as it transits its host star @xcite .",
    "to interpret a transmission spectrum using atmospheric retrieval requires that we are able to solve the inverse problem robustly and efficiently : given the wavelength - dependent transit radius , @xmath2 , we wish to infer the types and abundances of atoms and molecules that contribute to the opacity of the atmosphere . across a transmission spectrum ,",
    "the relative size of spectral features is proportional to the pressure scale height , which depends on temperature , surface gravity and mean molecular mass .    traditionally , one calculates the transmission spectrum by tracing a set of rays through the limb of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "each ray passes through a transit chord with varying degrees of transparency or opaqueness . by summing up the contributions from all of these chords ,",
    "one may calculate the effective occulting area of the exoplanet at a given wavelength , @xmath3 .",
    "several studies describe the theory of transmission spectra @xcite , but a unified approach is missing from the literature .",
    "part of the motivation of the present study is to present such a unified approach that thoroughly explores the assumptions , caveats and degeneracies associated with the calculation of transmission spectra . for the present study",
    ", we ignore the effects of refraction @xcite and multiple scattering @xcite .",
    "transmission spectra are insensitive to temperature variations and an isothermal approach should mostly suffice  we will prove this statement in the current study using our own formalism .",
    "the change in pressure across the transit chord is also small : it is @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 being the pressure scale height ) , which corresponds to less than an order of magnitude in pressure .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , an analytical formula for an isothermal , isobaric atmosphere should adequately serve as an accurate fitting function to data .",
    "one of the goals of the present study is to prove this statement . for completeness",
    ", we also generalize the isothermal formula for the transit radius to include a ( small ) temperature gradient in the region of the atmosphere probed by transmission spectroscopy .",
    "validated analytical formulae are invaluable for studying degeneracies in the model without expending much computational effort .",
    "an under - emphasized fact is that the normalization of a transmission spectrum depends on specifying a reference transit radius that is associated with a reference pressure .",
    "higher temperatures or a finite temperature gradient may be compensated by lower values of the normalization .",
    "the value of the reference transit radius may be matched to the measured white - light radius , but this measurement is associated with an uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , the functional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure is unknown .",
    "the reference pressure can not be extracted from the data and must be assumed .",
    "it is typically set to 10 bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another goal of the present study is to show that there is a degeneracy between the reference transit radius , reference pressure and water abundance that can not easily be overcome .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wasp12b ] , we show examples of model transmission spectra specialized to the wavelength range of the _ wide field camera 3 _ ( wfc3 ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ , and over - plot the data of wasp-12b measured by @xcite .",
    "( the parameter values used are listed in table [ tab : wasp12b ] . )",
    "it is apparent that the temperature , temperature gradient and degree of cloudiness are somewhat degenerate quantities that produce similar model transmission spectra .",
    "the spectral features just blueward and redward of the 1.4 @xmath6 m water feature break these degeneracies partially and allow for a unique fit to be obtained _ if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are fixed . _",
    "the final goal of the study is to introduce a fast method for performing this fit to data using a validated analytical formula , while pointing out that _ our ignorance of the relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure plagues our ability to extract accurate values of the water abundance .",
    "_ we then suggest an approximate expression to relate the reference transit radius and reference pressure .",
    "in  [ sect : formalism ] , we lay down the formalism for computing transmission spectra for both isothermal and non - isothermal atmospheres . in ",
    "[ sect : results ] , we benchmark our isothermal , isobaric analytical formula and report on its accuracy .",
    "we apply our formula to the case study of wasp-12b and discuss the degeneracies involved in data interpretation . in  [ sect : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "for illustration . see table [ tab : wasp12b ] and text for the parameter values assumed for these models . ]",
    ".parameter values used for wasp-12b models of transmission spectra in figure [ fig : wasp12b ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + note : for the analytical formula , a pressure of 1 mbar was assumed for the water opacity .",
    "now that we have demonstrated the accuracy of the isothermal , isobaric analytical formula for computing wfc3 transmission spectra , we return to the models presented in figure [ fig : wasp12b ] .",
    "@xcite have previously measured and interpreted the wfc3 transmission spectrum of the hot jupiter wasp-12b .",
    "they assumed the stellar radius to be @xmath7 .",
    "the reference transit radius was fixed at @xmath8 , while the reference pressure was assumed to be @xmath9 bar . as a proof of concept",
    ", we adopt the @xcite values for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , but explore four models where we varied the value of @xmath12 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 adopted are listed in table [ tab : wasp12b ] .",
    "note that these values of @xmath12 are well within the uncertainties associated with the white - light radius of @xmath13 measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite do not report the value of the surface gravity used , but we follow @xcite and use @xmath14 ( cgs units ) or @xmath15 cm s@xmath16 .    to compute model transmission spectra",
    ", we use the isothermal formula in equation ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) and also the non - isothermal formula in equation ( [ eq : nonisothermal ] ) .",
    "we add a constant opacity associated with clouds or aerosols to the total opacity , which is described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the water molecule , @xmath19 is the ( volume ) mixing ratio of water and @xmath20 is the water opacity . in other words",
    ", @xmath21 is the mass mixing ratio .",
    "we set @xmath22 .",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 adopted are listed in table [ tab : wasp12b ] .",
    "our assumption of a constant cloud opacity is justified only if the range of wavelengths probed is narrow , such as in the case of a wfc3 transmission spectrum .",
    "generally , higher values of the cloud opacity are needed as the temperature increases ( which increases the water opacity ) .",
    "[ fig : fit ]        [ fig : fit2 ]    as already discussed in the beginning of the study , figure [ fig : wasp12b ] shows us that the temperature , temperature gradient and degree of cloudiness are not easily teased apart from the data .",
    "this proof - of - concept comparison with the @xcite data informs us that cloudfree models are ruled out , but it is harder to pin down the values of temperature and cloud opacity , and also if a temperature gradient is present .",
    "higher temperatures may be compensated by lower values of @xmath12 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 and @xmath23 may in turn be adjusted to compensate for each other .",
    "the most discerning data points appear to be at 1.3 and 1.6 @xmath6 m , just blueward and redward of the water absorption feature , respectively .",
    "these sensitivity of these data points to temperature and cloudiness allow us to perform a fit to the data , provided we fix the values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows our formal fit to the wfc transmission spectrum of wasp-12b measured by @xcite , using the isothermal , isobaric formula in equation ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) .",
    "the details of this procedure are described in the appendix .",
    "we first wish to demonstrate that our simpler approach yields the same answer as the full retrieval method of @xcite . by setting @xmath8 and @xmath9 bar ,",
    "we obtain @xmath26 k and @xmath27 , which is consistent with the range of values reported in table 4 of @xcite .",
    "the cloud opacity is @xmath28 @xmath29 g@xmath30 .",
    "@xcite mention the use of a planetary radius scaling factor  to account for uncertainty in the pressure level in the atmosphere at a given radius \" .",
    "their figure 11 shows that this scale factor is @xmath31 , essentially very close to unity .",
    "recall that variations in the reference pressure appear as @xmath32 in the formula for the transit radius , which implies that they are muted by the logarithm even if @xmath11 is varied by several orders of magnitude . by contrast",
    ", variations in @xmath12 affect the transit radius linearly and produce large changes in the water mixing ratio .",
    "it is unclear if this scaling factor accounts for the uncertainties in the white - light radius of @xmath13 measured by @xcite .",
    "next , we set @xmath33 , which is a 3.4% increase from its previous value . remarkably , such a small increase in the reference transit radius leads to more than 5 orders of magnitude of decrease in the water mixing ratio obtained from the fit : @xmath34 .",
    "the cloud opacity becomes @xmath35 @xmath29 g@xmath30 .",
    "essentially , cloudiness and water abundance may be cancelled out by a larger normalization .",
    "furthermore , it is really @xmath36 that is the fitting parameter and not @xmath25 alone .",
    "any linear change in the reference pressure is compensated by the same factor in the water mixing ratio . in figure",
    "[ fig : fit2 ] , we show the values of @xmath37 obtained from fitting to the data as a function of the value of @xmath12 assumed .",
    "a more detailed exploration of these degeneracies is beyond the scope of the present study and deferred to future work .",
    "an outstanding issue with setting @xmath12 to be the white - light radius is that it is inconsistent with the assumption of @xmath38 . at all wavelengths",
    ", a transmission spectrum is probing transit chords with optical depths @xmath39 .",
    "a white - light transit radius would correspond to @xmath40 , not @xmath38 .",
    "this inconsistency may be alleviated by restoring the @xmath41 term in equation ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) , yielding @xmath42.\\ ] ] the preceding expression is now valid for all values of @xmath43 , but the issue remains that the functional form of @xmath44 is unknown .",
    "phenomenologically , one may fix @xmath11 and fit for the value of @xmath12 .",
    "the fit to the data will produce a solution for @xmath12 , but it is unclear if this value of the reference transit radius corresponds correctly to the chosen value of @xmath11 . to give a concrete example ,",
    "we return to the case of wasp-12b .",
    "we use the white - light radius to set @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "but what is the value of @xmath11 ?",
    "the measured transmission spectrum has nothing to say on this issue , as one can only fit for the value of @xmath36 and not @xmath25 alone .",
    "_ ideally , we would like to fix @xmath12 to the white - light radius and use theory to inform us what @xmath11 is .",
    "_ for isothermal , isobaric atmospheres , we have @xcite @xmath46 where we interpret @xmath47 as the geometric mean opacity within the white - light bandpass .",
    "the preceding expression is correct only at the order - of - magnitude level , because of the use of the geometric mean opacity .",
    "but it would break the degeneracy associated with the reference transit radius and reference pressure .",
    "having determined the values of both @xmath12 and @xmath11 , we may then perform a fit to the data to infer the water abundance .    using @xmath15 cm s@xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath48 k , @xmath22 and @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath49 km and @xmath50 .    in the limit that the water abundance is vanishingly small and",
    "the atmosphere is cloudfree , the pressures probed may be high enough that pressure broadening becomes important . in this case",
    ", the use of equation ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) becomes inaccurate .",
    "the influence of pressure broadening may be used to partially break the @xmath25-@xmath12-@xmath11 degeneracy , but it is probably degenerate with the degree of cloudiness in the atmosphere .",
    "there are several major implications of our findings .    * beyond identifying the presence of water in the wfc3 data ,",
    "our ability to accurately infer the water abundance is limited , due to transmission spectra lacking an absolute normalization .",
    "our ignorance of this absolute normalization is due to the unknown relationship between the reference transit radius and the reference pressure . *",
    "it needs to be emphasized that this problem remains even for data obtained using jwst , where multiple molecules are being probed across a broad wavelength range .",
    "the relative height of spectral features allow for the _ ratios _ of molecular abundances to be pinned down @xcite , but ultimately one of these molecular abundances will suffer from the same degeneracy we identified in the present study . *",
    "it has previously been proposed that the j band ( 1.221.30 @xmath6 m ) and water spectral feature ( 1.361.44 @xmath6 m ) , located within wfc transmission spectra , serve as diagnostics for the degree of cloudiness in an exoplanetary atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the lack of an absolute normalization and the degeneracies associated with temperature , a finite temperature gradient and the degree of cloudiness suggest that the true picture is more complicated and the interpretation is multi - dimensional . *",
    "we suggest an approximate relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure .",
    "however , since it is correct only at the order - of - magnitude level , it implies that the inferred abundance of water is only accurate at the order - of - magnitude level .",
    "it should also be emphasized that these degeneracies do not exist in the traditional forward problem : given a set of assumptions ( e.g. , identity and abundances of molecules , chemistry , irradiation conditions ) , one may construct a model atmosphere and trace lines - of - sight ( chords ) through it to obtain the transmission spectrum .",
    "for a fixed set of parameter values , one may uniquely calculate the relationship between each transit chord , the transit radius and pressure . for the inverse problem , the set of parameter values",
    "is not fixed and the task is to infer them from the data . in this case , the degeneracies unearthed in the present study manifest themselves .",
    "transmission spectra are easier to measure , because the signal is concentrated at the shorter wavelengths associated with starlight and its strength depends linearly on the ( isothermal ) pressure scale height .",
    "emission spectra scale with the fourth power of the atmospheric temperature , and the wavelengths at which the signal is the strongest increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "all things being equal , transmission spectra are easier to measure for small , temperate exoplanets with atmospheres .",
    "our study has shown that the knowledge needed to translate these measurements into precise chemical abundances and temperatures is incomplete .",
    "_ we acknowledge partial financial support from the center for space and habitability ( csh ) , the planets national center of competence in research ( nccr ) , the swiss national science foundation and the merac foundation .",
    "we thank brice - olivier demory , laura kreidberg and michael line for constructive conversations .",
    "we are grateful to mark marley for insightful feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript . _",
    "we perform a fit of equation ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) to the binned data points listed in table 3 of @xcite by implementing the ` curve_fit ` routine in ` python ` .",
    "we take the following approximation when computing the model transmission spectrum : we compute the water opacities ( with a pressure fixed at 1 mbar ) in each of the wavebands listed in table 3 of @xcite . within each wandband , we compute the _ geometric mean _ of the opacities .",
    "we then use these mean opacities to compute the model transmission spectrum , which we fit to the binned data .",
    "we check that our approach is sound by using the values of the fitting parameters to compute the transmission spectrum at full spectral resolution ( @xmath51 cm@xmath30 ; shown as the curve in figure [ fig : fit ] ) , which we then bin down ( shown as the squares in figure [ fig : fit ] ) and compare to the data points ( shown as the circles in figure [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "when this approach is repeated with the arithmetic mean of the opacities , it is apparent that the binned model does not match the data ( not shown ) .",
    "physically , we expect the geometric mean to be a fair averaging of the opacities , since one is dealing with values that span many orders of magnitude ."
