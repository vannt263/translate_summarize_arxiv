    "the clear presence of the fringes in the plot ensures that the two gaussian probability distributions in the evolved state of the walker are coherent , thus ; the evolved state is a cat state .    until now we have considered only those cases when the initial state of the walker is centred around @xmath80",

    "here we have set @xmath76 and the width of the gaussian @xmath99.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in this section , we have shown that the delocalized initial states of a quantum walker evolve to form the cat states .",
    "this result is independent of the coin parameter @xmath0 .",
    "however , the formation of the cat states strongly depends on the mean value of the momentum in the initial state .",
    "so far our analysis was based only on numerical results . in",
    "the following section , we present the analytic description for the formation of the cat states in quantum walks for the entire range of @xmath0 including the large @xmath0 regime where the dirac hamiltonian does not comply .",
    "the numerical results , although compelling , do not give us the real physics behind the formation of the cat states in the quantum walks . in this section",
    ", we present the reasons behind the formation of the cat states in the quantum walk .",
    "an important result in the previous section is that the cat states are formed due to the delocalized initial states that are centred around zero momentum .",
    "it suggests that the low - momentum behaviour of the quantum walks is responsible for the formation of the cat states .",
    "furthermore , from the small @xmath0 limit of the quantum walk hamiltonian , i.e. , dirac hamiltonian , we can see that the linear dispersion relation and the momentum - independent eigenvectors of the hamiltonian cause the formation of the cat states .",
    "interestingly , for small values of the momentum @xmath27 the hamiltonian @xmath31 in eq",
    ".   also has linear dispersion even though the hamiltonian @xmath31 itself is non - linear in @xmath27 ( see appendix  [ app : qwalkhamil ] for detailed calculations ) @xmath100 in other words , the energy @xmath101 does not have second order terms in @xmath27 and for small values of @xmath27 ( say @xmath102 ) the @xmath103 terms can be neglected , hence , giving rise to linear dispersion relation .",

    "along with the linear dispersion relation is responsible for the formation of the cat states .",
    "this can be understood as follows : if we start with a delocalized state @xmath106 of the walker @xmath107 which has a gaussian spread in the momentum space , centred around @xmath80 and having the width @xmath108 , and the coin state @xmath109 , then the evolved state at time @xmath55 reads @xmath110 where @xmath111 . now projecting the state @xmath112 on the coin state @xmath58 results in state of the walker @xmath113",
    "the state @xmath114 in   is the same as the state @xmath92 in   with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and in the position space @xmath114 represents a state which is in a superposition of two gaussians centred around @xmath117 .",
    "hence , @xmath114 represents a cat state .    alternatively , if @xmath118 and independent of @xmath27 then the probability distribution corresponding to the state @xmath114 in the momentum space is a product of a gaussian and @xmath119 .",
    "this means the probability distribution corresponding to the state @xmath114 has fringes exactly like the one in fig .  [",
    "fig : catfourier ] . in that case",
    "the state @xmath120 represents a cat state .    for appropriate choices for the state",
    "@xmath58 we can get @xmath121 which , for small values of @xmath27 , is @xmath27-independent . using eq .",
    "we construct one such class of state which reads @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a free parameter .",
    "this class satisfies the relation @xmath124 this completes our proof that the hamiltonian @xmath31 , and hence the one - dimensional dtqw , gives rise to the cat states .",
    "let us emphasize that the linear dispersion   does not mean that the hamiltonian is linear .",
    "in fact in our case , if we truncate the hamiltonian @xmath31 to the first order in @xmath27 , then we will not get the linear dispersion relation for large values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath125 terms in the hamiltonian @xmath31 make the dispersion relation linear .",
    "another interesting point to note is that the energy @xmath101   is a constant for two exceptional values of the @xmath0 , i.e. , for @xmath126 and @xmath127 the energy @xmath101 is independent of the momentum @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , at these values of @xmath0 the quantum walk does not evolve and hence we can not realize the cat states .    to summarize , we have shown that the formation of the cat states is due to the linear dispersion relation and the weak dependence of the eigenvectors of the quantum walk hamiltonian on the momentum @xmath27 . in the following section ,",

    "[ fig : decoherenceprob ] , we plot the spread of the walker over the lattice in the presence of all these baths .",
    "interestingly , we still get the bimodal distribution with an additional residual probability between the two peaks . for the case of amplitude damping bath ( the blue solid curve )",
    "the evolution is not symmetric .",
    "this is due to the fact that in amplitude damping one state of the coin is favoured over the other .",

    "although the evolved state in the presence of noise has a similar bimodal distribution as in the case of pure states ( without noise ) , the coherence in the two cases can be very different . to quantify the coherence in the evolved state of the walker we can calculate the revival fidelity of the evolved state upon reversing the dynamics using a physical operation  @xcite .",
    "if the state of the walker remains pure in the evolution then the walker can regain its original state by reversing the dynamics . however , if the walker loses the purity in the evolution then the revival is not perfect .    to quantify the coherence , first , we need to devise an operation that can reverse the dynamics of the quantum walk . in our numerical calculations , we find that the pauli spin operator @xmath143 acting on the coin state of the walker can be used to reverse the direction of propagation of the walker if the initial state of the walker is delocalized .    using the @xmath143 operator we can calculate the revival fidelity as follows : we first evolve the initial delocalized state of the walker for time @xmath144 in the presence of the bath . at this point , we reverse the dynamics by applying the @xmath143 operator on the coin .",

    "[ sub : implementation ] . in this implementation",
    ", the quantum walk is performed over the oam space of light . here",
    "we propose a method to manipulate and control the separation between the two distinct components in the cat state .",
    "the first requirement to realize a cat state in a one - dimensional quantum walk is the delocalized ( gaussian ) initial state .",
    "the gaussian initial state in the oam implementation of the quantum walk can be constructed , simply , by using a spatial light modulators ( slm )  @xcite .",
    "an slm is a device that can manipulate the transverse phase and the amplitude of a light beam .",
    "since the oam of light is due to the azimuthal phase profile in the transverse plane , slm is the perfect device to achieve an arbitrary superposition of the oam states . in order to create a delocalized initial state in the oam basis a phase hologram",
    "is displayed on the slm device .",
    "a plane wave is reflected from this device which acquires the transverse state corresponding to the phase hologram .",
    "thus , by using a spatial light modulator and using the scheme presented in ref .  @xcite we can form the cat states in the optical quantum walks .    after realizing the cat state , the next step is to control the separation between the macroscopic states of the walker . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : dtqw ] we have seen that the application of the momentum shift operator @xmath12 in a one - dimensional dtqw causes a periodic revival of the initial state of the walker .",
    "the walker regains its initial state after @xmath18 number of steps where the number @xmath156 is related to the parameter of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "we use the same @xmath12 to stabilize the cat state in the quantum walks . in order to stabilize the cat state at time @xmath55 ,",
    "first , we evolve the initial gaussian state of the walker for time @xmath55 using the quantum walk propagator @xmath10  .",
    "the evolved state @xmath65 reads @xmath157 at time @xmath55 we introduce the momentum shift operator @xmath12 in the quantum walk with a certain value of @xmath17 . due to the momentum shift operator",
    "the state of the walker starts oscillating , recovering the state @xmath65 periodically after the time period @xmath18 .",
    "hence , we can preserve the cat state @xmath65 for a long time .",
    "the only obstacle in preserving the cat states is the decoherence .    .",
    "here the width of the delocalized initial state is @xmath158 and the time of evolution is @xmath159 steps.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now if we want to increase the separation between the two gaussian wave - packets of the cat state @xmath65 , then we remove the operator @xmath12 after a time period which is an integer multiple of @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to decrease the separation between the two gaussian wave - packets we remove @xmath12 after @xmath160 followed immediately by one - time application of @xmath143 operation .",
    "hence , by introducing the @xmath12 and the reversal operation @xmath143 we can control and manipulate the cat states in the quantum walks .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : electricfid ] we show the numerically calculated revival fidelity of the cat states .",
    "here we have evolved the delocalized initial state for @xmath161 steps .",
    "then we apply @xmath12 for @xmath162 number of steps .",
    "we remove the operator @xmath12 and apply the quantum walk reversal operation @xmath143 and evolve the system for @xmath161 steps and calculate the fidelity with the initial state . here",
    "@xmath163 is an integer between @xmath74 and @xmath161 .",
    "we can see that for sufficiently large values of @xmath17 the revival fidelity converges to the value @xmath74 .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath12 can be implemented in the oam quantum walk by means of a dove prism  @xcite .",
    "the action of the dove prism on the oam states of light can be written as @xmath164 where @xmath123 is the angle of rotation of the dove prism along the propagation axis of the light beam .",
    "thus , two dove prisms in a sequence with angles @xmath165 and @xmath166 can implement the action of the operator @xmath12   with @xmath167 .",
    "the final component required to achieve the complete control over the cat states in one - dimensional quantum walks is the reversal operation @xmath143 . in the current scheme ,",
    "this operation can be achieved by simply using a half - wave plate that has the fast axis parallel to the horizontal axis .",
    "although , we can realize the @xmath12 and the @xmath143 operations using a dove prism and a half - wave plate , respectively , the real difficulty is in applying these operators at a given time @xmath55 and for a desired duration . to achieve this",
    "we can use optical switches in the quantum walk setup  @xcite .",
    "the role of an optical switch is to direct the light beam in a particular path that can be selected dynamically .",
    "thus , by using optical switches we can make the light beam in the oam quantum walk setup to pass through the free space which will result in the normal quantum walk . at time @xmath55 we can trigger the optical switch to make the light beam pass through the dove prism which will restrict the spread of the state of the walker .",
    "we can again trigger the switch at any desired time so that the beam again pass through the free space or though the third path which contains the half - wave plate .",
    "hence , by using optical switchs , dove prisms and a half - wave plate we can gain total control over the cat states in one - dimensional quantum walks .    to summarize",
    ", we have discussed an optical scheme to manipulate and control the cat state in oam quantum walks using linear optical devices half - wave plates and dove prisms , and optical switches .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a method to prepare cat states in quantum walk setups using delocalized initial states .",
    "our method is system - independent and works for the entire range of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we have also studied the effects of environmental interactions on the cat states and demonstrated that large separation in the cat states is possible even in the presence of noise .",
    "finally , we have presented a method to control and manipulate the cat states in optical systems .    the formation of the cat states in one - dimensional dtqw yields an interesting class of small - momentum hamiltonians that , despite being non - linear in the momentum , possess linear dispersion relation .",
    "both quantum walks and cat states have been used to describe the coherent energy transfer in photosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "the current proposal of preparing cat states using quantum walks threads the two concepts together , which might also contribute to a better understanding of the underlying physics of photosynthesis .",
