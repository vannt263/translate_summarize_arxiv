    "recent observations have revealed that the present state of the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "there are , in general , a number of different approaches towards explaining this acceleration .",
    "one such approach utilizes what is known as @xmath0 modification of gravity which , in effect is equivalent to brans - dicke ( bd ) type theories .",
    "the assumption of the existence of dark energy is another approach often used in this respect . in all the above theories , energy conditions impose stringent constraints",
    "whose validity should be studied in the light of their ability to explain the observational data . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "energy conditions in their various forms , namely strong energy condition ( sec ) , weak energy condition ( wec ) , dominant energy condition ( dec ) , and null energy condition ( nec ) have been used in different contexts to derive general results that would hold for a variety of situations @xcite .",
    "for example , the hawking - penrose singularity theorems invoke the wec and sec @xcite , whereas the proof of the second law of black hole thermodynamics requires the nec @xcite .",
    "another example comes from cosmology @xcite where energy conditions are studied by using red shifts .",
    "the equivalence between bd theories and @xmath0 gravity is a subject that has been studied by various authors , as an example see @xcite .",
    "the study of energy conditions may thus benefit from such equivalence in that knowing the energy conditions in one theory would point to the energy conditions in the other .",
    "for example , in the bd theory case @xmath1 @xcite where @xmath2 can not be found easily , one can use the equivalent @xmath0 theory to facilitate the calculation of @xmath2 which , could then be used in the bd theory .    even though the goal of this paper is to study energy conditions in modified theories of gravity and consequently in brans - dicke theory ,",
    "much of the techniques will be borrowed from the analysis of energy conditions in einstein s gravity .",
    "therefore , we shall briefly review the derivation of energy conditions in general relativity . for a pedagogical review ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a tangent vector to a congruence of time like geodesics .",
    "for a hypersurface orthogonal congruence , raychaudhuri s equation reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the expansion and sheer of two nearby tangent vectors , respectively . in einstein s gravity ,",
    "sec and the ensuing singularities theorem follow from requiring that @xmath7 for all time - like @xmath3 for which @xmath8 .",
    "a pair of nearby time - like geodesic vectors converge and will eventually intersect .",
    "the stress - energy tensor at each point @xmath9 obeys the inequality @xmath10 for any time like vector @xmath11 of an observer whose world - line at @xmath12 has the unit tangent vector @xmath13 and the local energy density appears to be @xmath14 .",
    "this assumption is thus equivalent to the energy density being non - negative as measured by any observer which , of course , is physically reasonable .",
    "in this section we use the metric formalism in @xmath0 gravity and derive the strong , weak and dominant energy conditions for a general form of @xmath0 . in doing so we will follow the formalism recently developed in @xcite .",
    "we take the freedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric to study the cosmological implications of the models studied here .",
    "the action for @xmath0 gravity is @xcite @xmath15 where we have set @xmath16 .",
    "the field equations resulting from this action in the metric approach , assuming the connections are that of the levi - civita , are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter considered as perfect fluid given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the stress energy tensor of the gravitational fluid @xmath21,\\ ] ] where a prime represents differentiation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the field equation ( [ eq4 ] ) now reads @xmath23 contracting the above equation we obtain @xmath24    now , let us briefly review the energy conditions in @xmath25 gravity .",
    "we begin by defining an effective stress - energy tensor using equation ( [ eq7 ] ) as follows @xmath26,\\ ] ] with @xmath27.\\ ] ] therefore , we can write @xmath28 in the terms of an effective stress - energy tensor and its trace , that is @xmath29 using the spatially flat @xmath30 frw metric as @xmath31 the effective energy density and pressure are given by @xmath32,\\ ] ] and @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the hubble parameter . now , using these equations , we can write the nec and sec , given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively as @xmath38 and @xmath39    to compare our results here with that of general relativity for a given @xmath0 , we use the frw metric which , for wec ( @xmath40 ) leads to @xmath41 for dec ( @xmath42 ) , we find @xmath43",
    "let us now investigate a non - minimally coupled self interacting scalar - tensor field theory such as the brans - dicke ( bd ) theory and find the various energy conditions for this type of modified gravity . in the context of bd theory @xcite with a self interacting potential and a matter field ,",
    "the action is given by @xmath44+{\\cal s}_{m},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the usual bd parameter and we have chosen units such that @xmath46 .",
    "the gravitational field equations can be derived from action ( [ eq18 ] ) by varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the stress - energy tensor of the normal matter as expressed in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "variation of action ( [ eq19 ] ) with respect to @xmath49 gives @xmath50,\\ ] ] where the expression @xmath51 , using ( [ eq12 ] ) is given by @xmath52 using the equation of motion , we can write @xmath53 where @xmath54 . the stress - energy tensor and its trace for the bd theory may now be calculated with the result @xmath55+[\\nabla_{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi - g_{\\mu\\nu}\\box\\phi ] -g_{\\mu\\nu}\\frac{v(\\phi)}{2},\\ ] ] and @xmath56 - 3\\box\\phi-2v(\\phi).\\ ] ] comparison of these equations with equation ( [ eq2 ] ) leads to a similar equation for the sec , @xmath57\\geq 0.\\ ] ] we can now write the relations for nec and sec analogously as @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively @xcite so that we may first derive @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the spatially flat frw metric as follows @xmath62 and @xmath63    thus , the nec and sec for the bd theory are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 now , following and expanding on the gr approach to include wec and dec , as has been employed in @xmath0 gravity theories , we may obtain similar equations in the bd theory .",
    "therefore , the wec and dec in the bd theory are respectively given by @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "considering action ( [ eq3 ] ) within the context of the metric formulation of @xmath0 gravity , one can introduce a new field @xmath68 and write a dynamically equivalent action @xcite @xmath69+{\\cal s}_{m}(g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi).\\ ] ] variation with respect to @xmath68 leads to equation @xmath70 provided @xmath71 , which reproduces action ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "redefining the field @xmath68 by @xmath72 and setting @xmath73 the action takes the form @xmath74 comparison with action ( [ eq19 ] ) reveals that this is the action of a bd theory with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , metric @xmath0 theories , as has been observed long ago , are fully equivalent to a class of bd theories with a vanishing kinetic term @xcite .",
    "now , taking @xmath70 and @xmath72 we have @xmath76 substituting these relations into equations for nec , sec , wec and dec in bd theory , namely equations ( [ eq28 ] ) , ( [ eq29 ] ) , ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) with @xmath75 , one can easily derive respectively nec , sec , wec and dec for the @xmath0 modification of gravity , that is equations ( [ eq15 ] ) , ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) .      to see how equation ( [ eq17 ] )",
    "can be used to put constraints on a given @xmath0 and equivalently on the bd potential , let us examine two examples .",
    "first , we consider @xmath0 as having a general power - law form , given by @xmath77 let us now concentrate on the vacuum sector _ i.e. _ @xmath78",
    ". substituting in equation ( [ eq17 ] ) we have the following condition for wec @xmath79 where @xmath80 and the deceleration @xmath81 , jerk @xmath82 and snap @xmath83 parameters for the present - day values are defined in @xcite .",
    "i what follows , we examine two values of the exponent @xmath84 , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86 which satisfy the inequality ( [ eq37 ] ) . +",
    "* case i * : @xmath85 + takeing @xmath87 and @xmath88 given in @xcite , so that @xmath89 . equation ( [ eq37 ] ) for @xmath85 reduces to @xmath90 this relation is satisfied for @xmath91 which in turn satisfies equation ( [ eq37 ] ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the potential in bd theory with @xmath75 for @xmath92 , corresponding to @xmath93 can thus be obtained simply as @xmath94 where @xmath95 , so that for @xmath85 the corresponding bd potential is @xmath96 . + * case ii * : @xmath86 + as a second case we consider @xmath86 , so that @xmath97 , leading to a wec given by @xmath98 which requires @xmath99 .",
    "the corresponding bd potential is @xmath100 with @xmath101 being negative .",
    "one can therefore come to the conclusion that @xmath2 must also have a negative value .",
    "let us now take the potential @xmath92 in bd theory with @xmath75 and use the following power - low anstze @xmath102 inserting these relations into equation ( [ eq21 ] ) in the vacuum sector , one then finds that @xmath103 substituting the spatially flat frw metric ( [ eq12 ] ) in the field equations ( [ eq4 ] ) we get @xmath104 and @xmath105 now , from equations ( [ eq38 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) we can write @xmath106 where we have used the relations @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the redshift of a luminous source @xcite . from this equation one may conclude that in the very early universe @xmath111 would have been small and therefore @xmath112 large .",
    "now , the wec is given by @xmath113 this equation for the effective energy density clearly satisfies the wec .",
    "if we follow the same method as in section 3 or in @xcite and substitute the total energy density and pressure by @xmath112 and @xmath114 , we will find the same relation between the distance modulus and redshift parameter which is studied in @xcite where the energy conditions have been used .",
    "now let us write the nec , dec and sec with respect to the redshift parameter as follows @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 respectively . from equation ( [ eq44 ] ) one can see that it is not possible to extract more information from nec .",
    "as far as the dec and sec are concerned however , they require @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "the first is in agreement with the observation that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase , @xmath120 .",
    "a glance at the last equation reveals that it is completely in contradiction with an accelerated expanding universe , but we know that the sec ensures gravity to be always attractive .",
    "violation , as discussed in @xcite , allows for the late time accelerated cosmic expansion as suggested by the combination of recent astronomical observations .",
    "what we have done so far in the pervious sections has been in the so - called jordan frame . however , it would also be instructive to study these relations in the einstein frame . as is well known , the usual procedure , going from one frame to the other , is to use a conformal transformation .",
    "a problem then arises in that whether the tensor representing the _ physical _ metric structure of space - time is the one belonging to the jordan frame or to the einstein frame .",
    "however , what we are concerned with in this work is the relation between the energy conditions in these frames and will not deal with the question posed above . under the conformal transformation",
    "@xmath121 and taking @xmath122 the action ( [ eq3 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath123 here @xmath124 as a result , one finds the field equations for the metric in the form @xmath125 also , the equation of motion for @xmath49 becomes @xmath126 for the frw metric we find @xmath127 in order to solve these equations for the case @xmath93 we use the following power - low _ anstze _ @xmath128 where @xmath111 and @xmath129 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the hubble parameter , @xmath130 , then reads @xmath131 now , using equations ( [ eq52 ] ) and ( [ eq54 ] ) we have @xmath132 matching the exponents of @xmath133 in equation ( [ eq55 ] ) we arrive at the following expression for @xmath111 @xmath134 if we define @xmath135 as @xmath136 then we obtain the following relations for @xmath60 and @xmath137 @xmath138 now let us write the wec , sec , dec , and nec @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 using our _ anstze _ ( [ eq58 ] ) , we find the following expression for the wec @xmath143 as we can see in equation ( [ eq68 ] ) , the wec always holds .",
    "however , in the case that either @xmath144 or @xmath91 , we have a constraint on @xmath84 , namely that @xmath84 must be even .",
    "for the other energy conditions at late times , @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 @xmath147 equation ( [ eq69 ] ) tells us that there is no guarantee that it remains positive .",
    "as can be seen , when the sec and nec hold , the dec does not . for these equations",
    "we also have a constraint on @xmath84 , that is , when either @xmath144 or @xmath91 , then @xmath84 must be even . in the case of @xmath144",
    "another constraint appears which is important for both equations .",
    "there are ranges of @xmath84 for which either sec or nec do not hold .",
    "figure 1 shows this situation .",
    "also , for the case @xmath148 , we see that the dec does not hold at all , regardless of the sign of @xmath101 .",
    "in this work we have studied the energy conditions in the bd theory and compared the results with that of @xmath0 gravity , benefiting from the ease with which the parameters of interest can be derived in the latter and subsequently used in the former .",
    "this would help us to check the validity of the energy conditions in bd theory by invoking the energy conditions derived from a generic @xmath0 theory .",
    "the parameters involved were shown to be consistent and compatible with an accelerated expanding universe .",
