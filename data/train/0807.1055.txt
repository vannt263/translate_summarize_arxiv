    "furthemore , in the same conditions , the origin of ttcl explants affected the number of buds per ttcl . indeed , with the hypocotyl ttcls , we obtained the best number of buds , followed by petiole then cotyledon ttcls ( 3.20 and 2.40 respectively ) .",
    "+ besides , 5 @xmath2 m of cdcl@xmath0 was enough to reduce significantly , the rate of shoot regeneration and the number of buds per ttcl explant except the number of buds per cotyledon ttcls which stayed unchanged ( table 1 ) . when the concentration of cdcl@xmath0 increased , the frequency of shoot regeneration and the number of buds per explant decreased ( table 1 ) .",
    "high cd concentration ( 250 @xmath2 m ) in the culture medium was lethal for callus culture and blocked shoot regeneration .",
    "depending on source explants , hypocotyl ttcls were more tolerant to cdcl@xmath0 than cotyledon and petiole ttcls .",
    "our results show that only hypocotyl ttcls were able to regenerate in the presence of 200 @xmath2 m of cdcl@xmath0 ( 3.56% and 0.07 bud per explant ) ( table 1 ) .",

    "+      based on the efficiency of the thin cell layer technology for the propagation of various plant species , even for the more recalcitrant ones , this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of cdcl@xmath0 on the frequency of shoot regeneration and bud numbers per ttcls in _ b. juncea _ l. czern . from ttcl explants",
    "excised transversally from young axenic plants .",
    "+ in our experiments , we showed a maximal frequency of regeneration in ms basal medium supplemented with naa ( 3.22 @xmath2 m ) , bap ( 26.6 @xmath2 m ) , sucrose ( 2% , w / v ) and agno3 ( 10 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "there is no significant difference in the frequency of shoot regeneration between the 3 organs tested .",
    "however , we observed a significant difference of bud numbers per explants between organs ( table 1 ) .",
    "indeed , for all organs , hypocotyl ttcls exhibited the highest bud number per explant , followed by petiole and cotyledon ttcls respectively .",
    "the effect of explant source on shoot regeneration was previously reported in traditional leaf and cotyledon explants in _",
    "b. juncea _ var .",

    "+ the presence of cdcl@xmath0 in the culture medium showed a negative impact on , both , the frequency of shoot regeneration and the number of buds per ttcl , even when the concentration of cdcl@xmath0 was low ( e.g. 5 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "high concentrations of cdcl@xmath0 ( 200 and 250 @xmath2 m ) were critical for the survival and the neoformation process of ttcl explants except hypocotyl ttcls which were able to regenerate at 200 @xmath2 m of cdcl@xmath0 ( table 1 ) .",
    "therefore , these results showed source explant variation in response to this metal . to the best of our knowledge , there is no report on this explant variation response to cdcl@xmath0 in _ b. juncea",
    "_ l. czern .",
    "+ it was known that cadmium is not essential for plant growth and development , and it was shown to inhibit the growth of many plant species such as bean ( poschenrieder _ et al_. 1989 ) , willow , poplar ( lunackova _ et al_. 2003 ; cosio _ et al_. 2005 ) , rice ( aina _ et al .",

    "_ 1998 ) and _ brassica juncea _",
    "( haag - kerwer _ et al .",
    "however , all these studies on cd toxicity were performed in plants which came directly from seeds .",
    "we believe , as well as gladkov ( 2007 ) , are the first authors who obtained regenerated plants in the presence of cd . indeed , gladkov ( 2007 ) showed that , the inhibitory effect of cd on _ agrostis stolonifera _ and red fescue ( _ festuca rubra _ ) callus cultures , was observed at cd@xmath4 concentration of 7 mg.l@xmath5 ; at 20 and 30 mg.l@xmath5 , considerable proportions of callus cells darkened and died , and a concentration of 60 mg.l@xmath5 was lethal to the cultures .",
    "he obtained some regenrated plants ( 30 from _",
    "a. stolonifera _ and 4 from _ f. rubra _ ) . + in our study , we observed that neoformed buds were able to accumulate cd@xmath4 in their tissues .",
    "this accumulation was function of cd concentration .",
    "therefore , an increase of cd amounts is correlated to an increase of concentration of cd in the culture medium .",
    "these results suggest a translocation of cd from medium to calli and then to the buds .",
    "+ regenerated plantlets were able to grow and flower normally 6 weeks after their transfer in the greenhouse and that whatever the concentration of cdcl@xmath0 and their identical to source plants ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "+ to conclude , our model of shoot regeneration in the presence of cd should be considered as a novel approach to _ in vitro _",
    "selection of tolerant regenerants which should be used in different phytoremediation processes to test their ability in the depollution of contaminated soils and their capacity to cumulate heavy metals .",
    "we suggest that _ in vitro _ selection process using ttcl technology in presence of heavy metals is a novel interesting alternative which , in the near futur , can be used as the transgenic approach for improving the capacity of _ b. juncea _ or other hyperaccumulator plants to tolerate , cumulate and translocate more cd or other heavy metals than the original wild type .",
