    "deep surveys of the submillimeter sky using the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope have uncovered a population of ultraluminous dusty galaxies at high - redshift ( smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1998 ; eales et al .  1999 ; blain et al.1999a ) .",
    "this population accounts for a large fraction of the extragalactic background at mm / sub - mm wavelengths ( blain et al .",
    "1999b ) and hence is important to our understanding of the distant universe .",
    "the sub - mm population is thought to contribute significantly to both the total amount of star - formation ( blain et al .",
    "1999b ) and agn activity ( almaini et al .",
    "1999 ) at high - redshift .",
    "the sub - mm population will likely show a mixture of agn and starburst properties given their apparent similarities to the local population of ultraluminous ( @xmath5 ) infrared galaxies ( uligs , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "however , we could expect the majority ( @xmath680% ) of the sub - mm galaxies to be predominantly powered by starbursts since this has been found for the local uligs ( genzel et al .",
    "the early co and x - ray data on the sub - mm population support the starburst nature of the population by showing the presence of sufficient molecular gas to fuel the star - formation activity ( frayer et al .  1998 , 1999 ) and the lack of expected x - ray emission if mostly dominated by agn ( fabian et al .",

    "observations of the dust - rich sub - mm galaxies complement the studies of the ultraviolet - bright lyman - break sources ( steidel et al .  1996 , 1999 ) which tend to be much less luminous at infrared wavelengths ( chapman et al .",

    "the sub - mm populations of galaxies will a complete picture for the star - formation history of the universe emerge .    in order to understand the nature of the sub - mm population ,",
    "we have been carrying out multi - wavelength observations of individual systems in the scuba cluster lens survey ( smail et al .",
    "this survey represents sensitive sub - mm mapping of seven massive , lensing clusters which uncovered 15 background sub - mm sources .",
    "the advantage of this sample is that the amplification of the background sources allows for deeper source frame observations .",
    "also , lensing by cluster potentials does not suffer from differential lensing so that the observed flux ratios will represent intrinsic values , despite the possible variation of source size at different wavelengths .",
    "the most challenging aspect for follow - up observational studies of the sub - mm population is determining the proper counter - parts to the sub - mm emission and obtaining their redshifts ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a ) .",
    "the large 15@xmath7 scuba beam leaves ambiguity in identifying the galaxy associated with the sub - mm emission .",
    "the early results based on optical imaging and spectroscopy were overly optimistic in the identification of the sub - mm counter - parts ( smail et al .",

    "1999 ) are incorrect . despite their ultra - high luminosities ,",
    "many sub - mm galaxies are nearly completely obscured by dust at ultraviolet / optical wavelengths .",
    "for these highly obscured galaxies , follow - up radio ( smail et al .",
    "2000a ) and/or mm interferometry ( downes et al .",

    "the galaxy smmj00266 + 1708 is an excellent example of such a source .",

    "spectroscopy of the galaxy m2 showed a bright [ oii ] emission line at @xmath10 , consistent with a luminous star - forming galaxy ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the fall of 1998",
    ", we searched for redshifted co(2@xmath111 ) emission corresponding to the redshift of m2 at the owens valley millimeter array ( ovro ) .",
    "we failed to detect any co emission at the redshift of m2 ; @xmath12jy@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , assuming a standard @xmath15 line width .",
    "if m2 was the correct counter - part and the source was similar to the sub - mm galaxies with previous co detections ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) , we would have expected a co(2@xmath111 ) line strength of approximately @xmath16 .",
    "the nondetection of co questions the association of m2 with the sub - mm galaxy .",
    "additional optical spectroscopy showed that m1 is at the redshift of the foreground cluster ( @xmath17 ) , and hence , m1 and m2 are not an interacting pair after all ( barger et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these results further bring into doubt the initial association of m1 and m2 with the sub - mm emission based on optical morphology alone .",
    "besides m1 and m2 , the only other optically visible source spatially consistent with the scuba position is m8 ( fig .",
    "however , the galaxy m8 shows no unusual properties that would suggest an association with a luminous sub - mm source .",
    "more significantly , the field has a weak radio source ( smail et al .",
    "2000a ) whose position is consistent with the scuba source , but is slightly offset from m8 . since the brightest sub - mm galaxies tend to have radio counter - parts ( smail et al .",
    "2000a ; barger , cowie , & richards 2000 ) , we could reasonably expect an association between the sub - mm galaxy and the radio source . if this is the case , the radio emission of smmj00266 + 1708 is too weak to be consistent with a redshift of @xmath18 for m8 ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ) , based on the redshift dependency predicted for the sub - mm / radio spectral index ( carilli & yun 1999 ) . although the sub - mm / radio spectral index only provides an estimate of the redshift given the uncertainties of source temperature and properties ( blain 1999 ) , it does provide a powerful technique for discriminating between low - redshift ( @xmath19 ) and high - redshift ( @xmath4 ) galaxies .",
    "smmj00266 + 1708 is expected to be at redshifts @xmath20 since its sub - mm / radio spectral index of @xmath21 is much larger than any known galaxy at low redshift ( smail et al .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that m8 is the sub - mm counter - part .",
    "since none of the optically detected galaxies are plausibly associated with the sub - mm emission , we have carried out mm - continuum and near - infrared observations of smmj00266 + 1708 .",
    "we have taken sensitive 1.3 mm interferometric observations of smmj00266 + 1708 in order to accurately constrain the position of the sub - mm source .",
    "smmj00266 + 1708 was observed several times using the ovro array in 1999 .",
    "approximately 10 hours of on source data were obtained during good conditions in the low resolution configurations of the array ( baseline lengths ranging from 15 m to 119 m ) .",

    "no primary beam correction was required since the source was located within @xmath25 ( 1/8 of the primary beam width ) of the phase center .",

    "the sub - mm systems may be associated with a very luminous , short - lived and heavily dust enshrouded starburst , while the lyman - break galaxies would be associated with a longer - lived , less luminous phase of star formation ( blain et al .",
    "if this scenario is correct , we could expect massive reservoirs of molecular gas associated with both populations .",
    "the detection of massive reservoirs of molecular gas ( frayer et al.1998 , 1999 ) suggests that the sub - mm population is associated with gas - rich massive galaxies ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the molecular gas masses of the sub - mm galaxies are 1050 times greater than that found for the milky way .",

    "2001 ) . due to the high levels of dust obscuration for the sub - mm galaxies , there is very little overlap between the sub - mm selected galaxies and optically - selected lyman - break systems . even for the lyman - break galaxies ,",

    "this source has an extremely high luminosity of approximately @xmath111 even after correcting for lensing .",
    "the current data for the sub - mm cluster lens survey suggest that 40%70% of the sub - mm population as a whole are faint / red galaxies which are undetected at optical wavelengths .",
    "these faint / red sub - mm galaxies are thought to contribute significantly to the total amount of star formation at high redshift and are hence important to our understanding of the early evolution of galaxies .",
