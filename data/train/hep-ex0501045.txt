    "according to experimental results it is possible to draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "for all three carbon targets spin dichroism of deuterons is observed , especially visible for the targets of 151 mg/@xmath104 , 188 mg/@xmath104 .",
    "dichroism grows in the energy region 6 - 20 mev .",
    "the sign change of spin dichroism and its not being proportional to the target thickness can be explained by a more complicated dependence of the cross section on the energy of particles , which changes when the beam passes through the target . for a more complete description of the dichroism observed in this energy region",
    "it is necessary to take into account spin - spin and coulomb interactions and a possible influence of resonant reactions of deuterons with carbon .",
