    "for approximately the past three decades , analysis of collisionally - excited forbidden lines in the optical / uv wavelength region has been the primary means of determining the physical conditions and element abundances in  regions and planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "studies of these emission lines have been a fundamental source of data for the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies other than the milky way and for comparison with models of stellar nucleosynthesis . for almost as long a time , however , there has been the nagging question of the reliablity of such abundance measurements .",
    "the crux of the problem is that collisionally - excited lines in the optical / uv part of the spectrum have large excitation energies ( 1 - 10 ev ) , and thus the excitation rates are acutely sensitive to electron temperature . @xcite pointed out that if significant fluctuations about an average temperature are present , the collisionally - excited line emission will be weighted toward hotter regions because of the exponential dependence on @xmath7 , while the balmer recombination lines will be preferentially produced in cooler regions because of the inverse dependence on @xmath7 . in this case ,",
    "ion abundances derived from the forbidden lines could be systematically underestimated by a large amount .",
    "it has not yet been demonstrated definitively that significant deviations from a smoothly - varying temperature structure exist in photoionized nebulae , other than the gradients expected from ionization / thermal equilibrium models .",
    "determining whether such temperature fluctuations exist and their magnitude is challenging observationally , and it is strongly debated whether temperature fluctuations have a significant effect on abundance determinations based on collisionally - excited lines ( see mathis 1995 for a balanced discussion ) .    it is often suggested that observations of recombination lines from the heavy elements would provide more reliable measures of element abundances than the commonly observed collisionally - excited lines .",
    "this is because recombination lines have very similar dependences on electron temperature , so the ratio of a given recombination line to , say , h@xmath2 is nearly independent of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , heavy element abundances could be calculated from recombination lines with virtually no systematic uncertainties , in principle .",
    "the main drawback is that recombination lines from elements heavier than he are intrinsically faint , typically less than 1% of h@xmath2 , because of the direct scaling of the emissivities with ion abundance . as a result ,",
    "few measurements of heavy element recombination lines have been published .",
    "nevertheless , improved spectrographs and detectors have enabled high quality measurements of heavy element recombination lines , particularly , to be made in recent years @xcite . at the same time , improved computations of effective recombination coefficients for transitions of heavy element recombination lines ( e.g. , storey 1994 ) have made the analysis more reliable . for the orion nebula",
    ", @xcite found that  recombination lines gave somewhat higher o@xmath3/h@xmath8 than the [ ] collisionally - excited lines , and interpreted this in terms of modest temperature fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have found that  and [ ] yield spectacularly discrepant o@xmath3 abundances in the planetary nebulae ( pne ) ngc 7009 and ngc 6153  with the  lines giving abundances 5 - 6 times larger than those derived from [ ] .",
    "these differences are so large that they can not be accounted for in the context of the @xcite small temperature fluctuation formulation .",
    "we have been obtaining new measurements of  recombination lines in pne to further understand the cause of the  - [ ] discrepancy . in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii )",
    ", we will present measurements of integrated  lines and derived abundances for a sample of ten pne , and compared these abundances with published results based on [ ] .",
    "the main results from paper ii are summarized in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , we find : ( 1 ) a wide range of values for the difference between - and [ ] - derived abundances ( @xmath9log o@xmath3/h@xmath8 anywhere between 0.0 and 0.8 dex ) ; ( 2 ) an inverse correlation between @xmath9log o@xmath3/h@xmath8 and nebular diameter ; and ( 3 ) that  lines arising from levels populated mainly by dielectronic recombination are especially enhanced . in a companion program",
    ", we have obtained deep long - slit observations of some pne to study and compare the spatial distribution of both and [ ] emission , in the hope that this would provide new clues toward understanding the source of the abundance discrepancies . in this paper",
    "we describe the results for the largest object in our sample , the ring nebula ngc 6720 .",
    "we have observed several galactic planetary nebulae in long - slit mode in order to study the spatial distribution of emission from both the  recombination lines and [ ] forbidden lines .",
    "these observations were obtained on the clear nights 6 - 7 june 1999 with the 2.3 m bok reflector at steward observatory , using the boller & chivens spectrograph .",
    "the spectrograph has a 1200@xmath10800 loral ccd with 15@xmath11 m pixels , corresponding to 083 per pixel at the detector .",
    "the four - arcminute long slit thus covers about 285 rows on the detector .",
    "we used an 832 line / mm grating in second order to cover the spectral range 4150 - 5000  . with a 25 slit ,",
    "the spectral resolution was in the range 2.1 - 2.3  , with the best resolution set at approximately 4650  . in our ring nebula observations ,",
    "the spatial profiles of stars along the slit had a fwhm of approximately 25 .",
    "we centered the long slit on the ngc 6720 central star , with the slit at a position angle of 91@xmath12 , where the pa is measured from n through e. we made four 15-minute exposures at this position .",
    "the two - dimensional data were processed by standard methods . the wavelength solution for the spectra",
    "was determined from the positions of he - ar lines from calibration lamp observations taken through the same spectrograph setup .",
    "the root - mean - square residuals from a fourth - order polynomial solution were approximately 0.1  .",
    "the object frames were divided by a normalized flat - field constructed by combining observations of the illuminated dome and the twilight sky .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction using standard kitt peak national observatory extinction coefficients ; and finally , the spectra were placed on a relative photometric scale using a spectrometer sensitivity function derived from observations of standard stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "note that because of the narrow slit , absolute spectrophotometry was not possible ; however , the relative end - to - end photometric calibration is good to about 3% ; the flat - field uncertainty adds another 1% to the errors .    after calibration",
    ", the four individual frames were combined to form a single image , and the sky background was subtracted . at this time we also extracted a section of the frame 131 pixels ( 109 ) wide containing only the bright emission from the nebula ( along the east - west direction ) , and rectified the image to align the centroid of the central star with the rows of the image , to ensure that features in each emission line lined up spatially .",
    "we saw no variation in the background between the four separate observations , so we averaged the frames before subtracting the background to improve the signal / noise for the sky determination .",
    "the sky level along each column was determined by a linear fit to the background in regions along each column outside the bright part of the nebula .",
    "note that the ring nebula has an extended halo outside the bright inner nebula @xcite .",
    "the faint emission from this halo is seen in the brightest lines in our spectrum , h@xmath2 , h@xmath13 , and [ ] 4959  .",
    "the halo emission extends across the entire slit ; however , this emission has a surface brightness of less than 1% of the surface brightness in the bright shell .",
    "therefore , subtraction of the halo component will have little effect on the line ratios we derive in the inner nebula .",
    "the final processing of the data involved extracting spatial cuts of various emission lines from the image .",
    "the extraction method was similar to that used for extracting one - dimensional stellar spectra , except that we did the extraction along lines of constant wavelength .",
    "as part of the extraction we subtracted the nebular and stellar continuum by fitting to line - free regions of continuum near the wavelengths of each extracted emission line .",
    "the result was an array of pure emission line flux vs. spatial position for each extracted line .",
    "note that continuum subtraction by this method does not take into account absorption lines in the central star spectrum , or in starlight scattered by dust within the nebula , that may coincide with an emission line .",
    "the effect of stellar absorption will manifest itself as peculiar emission line ratios at the position of the central star , and in general we will exclude the regions including the central star from the discussion ; the effects of scatterd starlight will be much smaller , and in any case would mean that the permitted lines are systematically even stronger than observed .",
    "figure 1 shows examples of extracted spatial profiles for a few emission lines .",
    "figure 2 shows an expanded view of the spectral region around 4661 for two different positions along the slit .",
    "figure 2 shows that , although [ ] @xmath14658 is significantly stronger than  @xmath14661 in the inner part of the ring nebula , the two lines are readily distinguished and can be deconvolved accurately .",
    "we can estimate the interstellar reddening along the slit from the h@xmath13/h@xmath2 intensity ratio .",
    "this ratio depends slightly on the nebular electron temperature @xmath7 . for ngc 6720",
    "@xmath7 is between 10,000 k and 12,000 k @xcite ; in this range of @xmath7 , the h@xmath13/h@xmath2 ratio is 0.47 @xcite .",
    "the relation between observed and reddened line ratios is given by @xmath14 where i@xmath15 and i@xmath16 are the observed and intrinsic line intensities , and f(@xmath1 ) @xmath17 f(h@xmath2 ) = 0.13 for @xmath1 = h@xmath13 , from the average interstellar reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 ( or , more commonly , @xmath18(h@xmath2 ) ) is then the logarithmic ` extinction ' at h@xmath2  more accurately , a combination of absorption and scattering .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the spatial variation of @xmath18(h@xmath2 ) we derive along the slit for ngc 6720 . generally , we see values for @xmath18 ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 along the slit , with possibly a slow increase from east to west along the slit",
    ". the reddening values we derive are consistent with the values obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note the spike at the position of the central star , where the line ratio is very likely affected by stellar absorption .",
    "note also the steep upturn at the e end and the downturn at the w end .",
    "we suspect these steep changes are not real , but artifacts resulting from small misalignment of the h@xmath2 and h@xmath13 extractions , combined with a small variation of the focus , at positions where the nebular surface brightness profile is declining rapidly ( see figure 1 )",
    ".    nevertheless , the correction for reddening relative to h@xmath2 is small for all lines in our observed spectral region along most of the slit , less than 10% over the region @xmath1938  from the central star .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3(b ) , where we show the ratio of i(h@xmath13)/0.47  i(h@xmath2 ) .",
    "if there were no reddening , this ratio would be close to unity ; figure 3(b ) shows that this ratio is within 10% of unity over the region where the emission is bright .",
    "if we ratio lines in the blue half of the spectrum to h@xmath13 and those in the redward half to h@xmath2 , the error accrued is less than 5% over the regions of interest in the nebula . in the end , we chose this method to correct the line intensities .",
    "the regions of the nebula beyond @xmath1940  from the central stars have too low s / n for the faint lines to contribute to our analysis , so we will exclude them from the following discussion .",
    "our spectrum includes the [ ] 4711 , 4713   doublet ; the ratio of these two lines is sensitive to the electron density @xmath20 , similar to the [ ] 6717 , 6731   pair .",
    "there is one complication in using the [ ] ratio : the 4711   line is blended with the  4713 line at low resolution .",
    "this is apparent in our spectrum by a larger line width for the 4711   line , as well as a shift in wavelength from the inner nebula , where [ ] is strong and  weak , to the outer ring where  predominates .",
    "we can correct for the  4713   contamination by subtracting a scaled version of the  4471   line profile . @xcite estimated @xmath20 from [ ] line ratios in the ring , obtaining values of 200 - 600 @xmath21 . at these densities ,",
    "collisional excitation has a small effect on the 4713/4471 line ratio , so we choose to neglect it . for @xmath7",
    "@xmath5 10,000 k , the 4713/4471 intensity ratio is 0.11 , based on the emissivities computed by @xcite . assuming a constant temperature in the  zone",
    ", we multiply the 4471   fluxes by 0.11 , then subtract the result from the 4711   line fluxes . the correction to the 4711   fluxes are small for the inner nebula , where  emission is faint , and greatest in the outermost parts of the nebula .",
    "we estimated @xmath20 from two regions on either side of the central star , using the atomic code described by @xcite , assuming an electron temperature @xmath7 = 11,000 k. east of the central star , the mean [ ] ratio was 1.33@xmath190.03 ( where the error is the rms scatter about the mean ) , which corresponds to @xmath20 = 740@xmath19250 @xmath21 , while west of the central star , the [ ] ratio was 1.34@xmath190.06 , which yields @xmath20 = 660@xmath19500 @xmath21 .",
    "these values are consistent with the densities obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived densities approximately twice as large as ours ; however , this is the result of using atomic data for [ ] that are now out of date .",
    "we have re - computed @xmath20 using barker s data and the shaw & dufour program , and obtain densities similar to the ones we obtain from [ ] .",
    "since we observe both [ ] 4363   and [ ] 4959  we can estimate the electron temperature @xmath7 across the nebula .",
    "figure 4(a ) plots the variation of @xmath7 derived from the [ ] ratio , showing a smooth increase in @xmath7 from the shell to the interior of the nebula , from about 10,000 k in the shell to about 12,000 k in the center .",
    "this behavior is in good agreement with that derived by @xcite .    for comparison , we plot in figure 4(b ) the [ ] @xmath14959/h@xmath2 line ratio across the slit .",
    "we note several features in the plot .",
    "first , the line ratio shows only a slow variation across most of the nebula , with a shallow minimum in the center .",
    "second , we see a steep decline in [ ] /h@xmath2 at about 36  from the central star in both directions",
    ". this most likely corresponds to the transition from o@xmath3 to o@xmath8 near the edge of the bright shell .",
    "third , [ ] /h@xmath2 increases again outside the bright shell , corresponding to the inner halo region , which evidently has rather high excitation and/or high ionization along these sightlines .",
    "note that the minima in @xmath7 do not correspond to the minima in [ ] /h@xmath2 , but rather lie just interior to the low - excitation zones .",
    "@xmath7 then appears to increase a bit in the region of low [ ] /h@xmath2 ; this increase may be a result of radiation hardening combined with inefficient cooling in the low - ionization zone of the nebula .",
    "the signal / noise in our 4363   line observation is too low to determine @xmath7 in the halo region .",
    "now that we have established the variation of @xmath7 across ngc 6720 , we can proceed to determine abundances for the ions of interest . for this study",
    ", we will derive abundances relative to h@xmath8 for o@xmath3 ( from both [ ] 4959   and  4661  ) , c@xmath3 ( from  4267  ) , he@xmath8 , and he@xmath3 , as a function of position along our slit .",
    "since the electron densities across the nebula are relatively small , we can assume the low - density limit and compute the ion abundances analytically .",
    "the abundance of any ion relative to h@xmath8 derived from the ratio of the intensity of a transition @xmath1 to the intensity of h@xmath2 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the volume emission coefficient for a given emission line @xmath1 .",
    "for collisionally - excited lines in the low - density limit , the analysis in section 5.9 of @xcite applies .    the volume emission coefficient for a collisionally - excited line is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the collision strength for the transitions observed , @xmath26 is the statistical weight of the lower level , and @xmath27 is the excitation energy of the upper level .",
    "for [ ] we use the collision strengths from @xcite , interpolated to a temperature of 11,000 k ; the collision strength for the 4959 , 5007   lines varies by only 8% between 10,000 k and 15,000 k , so the assumption of a constant @xmath25 introduces only a small error .    for recombination lines ,",
    "the emission coefficient is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29(@xmath1 ) is the effective recombination coefficient for the recombination line @xmath1 . for the  4661   line ,",
    "we use the effective recombination coefficient derived by @xcite for ls - coupling in case b. for h and  we used the recombination coefficients from @xcite , while for  we used the emissivities computed by @xcite .",
    "we employ a value @xmath29 (  @xmath14661)/@xmath29(h@xmath2 ) = 1.29 for @xmath7 = 10,000 k ; this ratio varies by only 4% between 10,000 k and 15,000 k. similarly , @xmath30 (  @xmath14686 ) = 11.9@xmath30(h@xmath2 ) for @xmath7 = 11,000 k , varying by only 9% between 10,000 k and 20,000 k , and @xmath30 (  @xmath14471 ) = 0.501@xmath30(h@xmath2 ) at @xmath7 = 10,000 k and @xmath20 = 100 @xmath21 ; collisional excitation increases @xmath30(@xmath14471 ) by only 5% at @xmath20 = 10@xmath31 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "given the relatively low densities we derive for the ring , and the small variation across the nebula , we can neglect collisional excitation of .",
    "finally , we computed c@xmath3 abundances from the  4267   line using the case b effective recombination coefficient from @xcite and @xcite . at @xmath7 = 10,000 k , @xmath29 (  @xmath14267)/@xmath29(h@xmath2 ) @xmath5 9.1",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison of the spatial distribution of the [ ] 4959   emission and the  4661   emission in the ring .",
    "it is readily apparent that the [ ] and  lines have distinctly different spatial distributions . the [ ] emission essentially follows the h@xmath2 emission , peaking slightly interior to the h@xmath2 peak , consistent with the ring - like morphology of the nebula . in contrast , the  emission peaks @xmath32 the [ ] -emitting region .",
    "this behavior is remarkable - if the  @xmath14661 emission arises mainly from radiative recombination of o@xmath3 to o@xmath8 , then one would predict that the  emission would peak @xmath33 from the central star than the [ ] emission , where the ionization decreases .",
    "clearly , the  and [ ] emission lines arise under dissimilar conditions .    in figure 6",
    "we show the computed o@xmath3 abundances as derived from the forbidden lines and the recombination lines , using the electron temperatures shown in figure 4(a ) .",
    "again , we see that o@xmath3 as derived from [ ] peaks in the shell while o@xmath3 derived from the recombination line is more concentrated toward the center of the nebula . to demonstrate that the results are not a result of low signal / noise in the 4661   line , we also plot in figure 6 the abundances we obtain from binned ( summed over 8 - 12 ) spectra extracted at several intervals along the slit .",
    "the agreement between the binned spectra and the point - by - point measurements is excellent .",
    "another thing that is apparent upon inspection of figure 6 is that the discrepancy between the [ ] and  abundance results is not constant ; the discrepancy is much larger for the central regions of the nebula , where o@xmath3 ( ) is as much as ten times larger than o@xmath3 ( [ ] ) , than in the bright shell , where the difference is not more than a factor of two .",
    "similar behavior has also been seen by @xcite in the planetary nebula ngc 6153 , another shell - like nebula .",
    "this suggests a common origin for the forbidden - line / recombination - line abundance discrepancy .",
    "the helium abundance derived from our observations is shown in figure 7 , with the total he / h plotted as the solid line and the he@xmath3 contribution as the dashed lines .",
    "the plot shows that the helium abundance remains rather constant across the ring nebula , apart from possibly a small upturn at the edges of the shell .",
    "this increase is seen in he@xmath8 , and may be due to the assumption of a constant electron density across the shell ; however , the effect is not large .",
    "the average helium abundance we derive , he / h @xmath5 0.12 , is about 10% smaller than that derived by @xcite , he / h @xmath5 0.135 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is not clear .",
    "we do agree , however , that the helium abundance is essentially constant across the ring .",
    "finally , in figure 8 we display the c@xmath3 abundances derived from our measurements of  @xmath14267 , compared with the o@xmath3 derived from .",
    "the c@xmath3 abundance shows an increase toward the nebula center similar to that of o@xmath3 , although the increase is not as strong .",
    "we find that c@xmath3/o@xmath3 @xmath5 1 in the bright shell , decreasing to @xmath5 0.5 ( approximately the solar value ) in the center .",
    "this variation could be due to ionization effects ( increasing importance of c@xmath34 in the interior ) , a real c / o abundance variation across the nebula , or a variation in the emission mechanism .",
    "note that the c@xmath3 abundance in the shell is similar to that derived for ngc 6720 ( c / h @xmath5 6@xmath1010@xmath35 ) from the ] 1908   feature by @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived c@xmath3 abundances in the ring nebula from measurements of  @xmath14267 and from @xmath36 measurements of ] @xmath11908 .",
    "he found that the abundances derived from these two lines differed by a large factor in the central part of the ring nebula , but that the difference decreased radially outward and essentially disappeared in the bright shell .",
    "this behavior is very similar to what we see for abundances derived from  and [ ] .",
    "this suggests a common mechanism affecting emission lines from both o@xmath3 and c@xmath3 .",
    "our long - slit observations of the ring nebula demonstrate that the  and [ ] lines have very different spatial distributions .",
    "the big surprise is that the peak recombination line emission occurs in the region interior to the [ ] zone , in contrast to the expectations if the  emission is the result of radiative recombination of o@xmath3 .",
    "either the  lines are enhanced in the inner nebula or the electron temperature derived from [ ] is greatly overestimated in the nebular interior .    in paper ii",
    ", we identify other surprising results .",
    "we find that the size of the - [ ] abundance discrepancy , @xmath9 log(o@xmath3/h@xmath8 ) , is anticorrelated with pn diameter and mean emission measure .",
    "we also see that  lines that arise from levels populated mostly by dielectronic recombination are more discrepant than other  lines when compared with the forbidden lines .",
    "these results , together with our new observations of the ring nebula , must be giving us important clues regarding the origin of the discrepancy between the recombination lines and the forbidden lines .",
    "here we discuss some of the possible mechanisms for producing the abundance discrepancies ; other possibilities will be examined in paper ii .",
    "temperature fluctuations have been invoked to explain why collisionally - excited lines give lower abundances than the recombination lines @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the abundance discrepancies observed in ngc 7009 @xcite , ngc 6153 @xcite , and the ring nebula ( this paper ) are so large that they are are no longer in the regime where peimbert s formalism of small temperature fluctuations applies . for example , in the ring nebula we find that the  lines yield abundances as much as ten times larger than the [ ] lines in the center of the nebula .",
    "if we assume that the  lines give the correct abundances , we can estimate the magnitude of temperature fluctuations needed to obtain the same abundances from the [ ] lines .",
    "forcing the [ ] lines to give the same abundances requires an average temperature @xmath37 @xmath5 6,500 k in the center of the nebula , and @xmath37 @xmath5 9,000 k in the shell , whereas we derived @xmath4 [ ] @xmath5 12,000 k in the center and @xmath4 [ ] @xmath5 10,000 k in the shell . using the @xmath38 formalism of @xcite",
    ", these temperature differences imply @xmath38 @xmath5 0.03 in the shell and @xmath38 @xmath5 0.16 in the center of the nebula ! @xmath38 = 0.16 corresponds to rms temperature variations of @xmath1940% .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how such wild temperature variations could go unobserved [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] .    still , we saw in figure 4(a ) that there is a radial gradient in t [ ] within the ring nebula .",
    "this variation could give rise to a noticeable @xmath38 term if the temperature measured from the summed spectrum differs significantly from the emission - measure - weighted average temperature .",
    "we compare the [ ] temperature derived from the ring nebula spectrum summed along the entire slit with the average [ ] temperature weighted by the [ ] @xmath14959 intensity along the slit .",
    "the temperature derived from the full - slit spectrum is 10,950 k , while the emission - weighted average temperature is 10,860 k. using equation ( 4 ) of @xcite , the measured difference in t [ ] corresponds to @xmath38 = 0.003 .",
    "this is too small to have a significant impact on abundances",
    ". nevertheless , such gradients in @xmath7 are likely to be common in  regions and pne , and should be taken into account whenever possible .",
    "@xcite have also argued that temperature fluctuations are unable to account for the large discrepancy between forbidden - line and recombination - line abundances in ngc 6153 .",
    "they derived @xmath7 from both the [ ] lines and from the balmer jump / line ratio in ngc 6153 ; the balmer jump temperature was determined to be 3000 k smaller than the [ ] temperature .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite found that this difference in @xmath7 could account for only one - third of the factor of nine difference in the derived o@xmath3 abundances in ngc 6153 .",
    "furthermore , they found that abundances derived from @xmath39 measurements of collisionally - excited [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] ir fine - structure lines agree very well with the results from corresponding optical forbidden lines .",
    "since the ir fine - structure lines have a very weak temperature dependence compared to the optical forbidden lines , it is difficult to reconcile the good agreement in ir and optical abundances with the idea of significant temperature fluctuations .",
    "these results and ours are evidence that temperature fluctuations can not account entirely for the large differences between recombination lines and forbidden lines in pne",
    ".      shocks can provide a source of additional heating for a photoionized gas , and have been proposed as a mechanism to account for temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "shocks can heat a photoionized plasma by transforming the kinetic energy of a flow ( e.g. , a stellar wind ) into random thermal energy , and strong shocks heat the ambient medium to very high temperatures .",
    "high - excitation lines such as [ ] 4363   would be preferentially enhanced behind shocks in photoionized nebulae .",
    "@xcite showed that an interstellar shock superposed on the spectrum of an  region could lead to a spuriously high measured electron temperature , and thus to underestimated abundances from collisionally - excited lines in the optical spectrum .    in a pn",
    ", a shock front is expected to be formed at the interface between a fast stellar wind from the central star and the slowly - expanding circumstellar envelope .",
    "the fast stellar wind would carve out a hot bubble in the interior of the nebula which would emit primarily in x - rays .",
    "clear evidence for such hot bubbles has been found recently for a small number of pne from x - ray imaging @xcite .",
    "evidence that shocks enhance temperatures in photoionized gas in an observable way is generally lacking , however .",
    "physically , a shock is an extremely thin structure , only a few particle mean free paths thick ; the high - temperature recombination zone downstream from the shock is generally only a few times 10@xmath40 cm deep in interstellar shock models @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect the shock front to be manifested by a sharp , narrow spike in the spatial profile of @xmath7 .",
    "examination of figure 4 shows that we observe no sharp jumps in @xmath7 across the ring , only a smooth increase from the shell to the center .",
    "the rms deviations from this smooth profile are less than 200 k. one must consider that the spatial resolution of our data , 2@xmath415 @xmath5 2@xmath1010@xmath42 cm at a distance of 600 pc , is larger than the expected width of the shock cooling zone , and that we are observing a temperature averaged along a chord through the nebula .    another problem that must be considered is the structure of the pn and its effect on the propagation of the shock .",
    "@xcite has simulated the radiation - gas dynamical evolution of a pn in the context of the interacting - winds model @xcite .",
    "these models begin with a slowly - expanding red giant wind .",
    "the pn expansion is initiated by the onset of a slow , high - density `` superwind '' which lasts a few thousand years , creating a dense shell of gas around the central star . following the end of the superwind , a high - velocity , low - density `` fast wind '' ensues , clearing out a central cavity and exposing the hot stellar core .",
    "frank followed the gas dynamics and ionization / thermal evolution of the nebula simultaneously .    in the model ,",
    "the fast wind drives a shock into the superwind , creating a hot central bubble .",
    "the low density in the bubble allows radiation from the hot stellar remnant to penetrate and ionize the dense shell .",
    "the high pressure in the hot bubble drives a forward shock into the dense shell .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows a snapshot of the dynamical , thermal , and ionization properties of the nebula at a point which is comparable to the current state of the ring nebula . at this stage ,",
    "the nebula is fully ionized , and the temperature profile in the dense shell is determined by radiative cooling and heating . at this point ,",
    "the forward shock is nearly isothermal and does not produce a noticeable temperature jump .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the lack of a temperature discontinuity in our observations of the ring nebula .",
    "however , a sharp jump in @xmath4 is seen at the contact discontinuity between the hot bubble and the dense shell in frank s models .",
    "one might then expect to see sharp jump in observed @xmath7 at this point in a pn .",
    "we do not observe such a jump in the ring , but this may be due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "considering the results of our observations and frank s models leads us to conclude that shocks can not explain the large discrepancy between forbidden - line and recombination - line abundances , although shocks should be present .",
    "spectroscopic observations with better spatial resolution should show whether shocks produce any significant effect on temperature profiles in pne .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that abundance inhomogeneities could produce anomalously strong recombination lines from heavy elements in pne .",
    "if the central region of the pn contains hydrogen - depleted material , the metal - rich interior would be expected to have a low electron temperature due to strong cooling by ir fine - structure line emission .",
    "thus , optical forbidden lines would be weakened in this region while the recombination lines are enhanced .",
    "the optical forbidden lines would be produced mainly in the h - rich shell and would reflect the conditions and abundances there .",
    "a number of observable consequences result from this model .",
    "first , it might be expected that the central nebula would be enriched in helium as well , if the c and o enhancements result from incomplete mixing of he - burning products .",
    "figure 7 , however , shows that this is not the case for the ring nebula  he / h is essentially constant across the nebula .",
    "alternatively , one might hypothesize that the central region is enhanced in c and o by a wind from a h- and he- depleted central star",
    ". however , the central star of the ring nebula is classified as h - rich @xcite .",
    "second , one would expect the observed @xmath7 to decrease toward the center of the nebula . from figure 4 , however , we see that @xmath7 @xmath43 toward the center .",
    "one could get around this by arguing that the derived temperature toward the center does not reflect the conditions in the interior , but rather in the shell projected along the line of sight .",
    "such a condition could occur if the nebula were shaped like a lozenge or an ellipsoid with the minor axis along the line of sight to the central star . in this configuration",
    ", gas near the minor axis would be closer to the central star and be subject to a stronger ionizing radiation field ( i.e. , a higher ionization parameter ) , and thus would have a higher @xmath7 .",
    "this configuration conflicts with the model for the ring presented by @xcite .",
    "based on the measured velocity field in the nebula , they argue that the ring is a prolate ellipsoid with the major axis pointing at a small angle to the line of sight , a configuration roughly orthogonal to the one discussed above .",
    "finally , ir fine - structure line measurements do not show much evidence for the large abundance enhancements needed to explain the observed recombination line emission @xcite .",
    "( see also the discussion in section 5.1 . ) from the above discussion , we conclude that the strong recombination line emission in the central region of the ring does not reflect an h - poor , metal - enriched interior .",
    "@xcite have also considered the question of abundance inhomogeneities .",
    "they first determined that simple density inhomogeneities in a nebula with homogenous abundances could not account consistently for the strengths of forbidden lines , recombination lines , and the balmer line ratios in ngc 6153 .",
    "they next considered super - metal - rich ( smr ) condensations , and found that they could account for the emission line strengths in ngc 6153 with a model having dense , h - depleted inclusions that occupy a very small fraction of the volume .",
    "in this model , the heavy element recombination lines arise predominantly in the cool , dense condensations , while the forbidden lines are emitted primarily in the hotter , low - density component .",
    "@xcite were able to produce models of this kind that were able to reproduce the strengths of the recombination lines as well as the optical , uv , and ir collisionally - excited lines .",
    "chemical inhomogeneities might be expected in a pn , since c , n , and he are produced in different regions of the progenitor star .",
    "convective mixing during the red giant phase could homogenize the pn envelope , but such mixing might never be complete , especially in very late stages prior to envelope ejection .",
    "hydrodynamic instabilities would promote clumping in the gas , and a clumpy stellar wind may eject chemically inhomogeneous knots of gas .",
    "evidence for knots of h - depleted material is seen in several pne , for example abell 30 @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", there are a number of difficulties with this model as an explanation for the apparent abundance discrepancies .",
    "@xcite noted the difficulty of maintaining the postulated dense knots in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding nebula .",
    "another difficulty is the roughly equal enhancements of c , n , o , and ne in the recombination line emission .",
    "this is inconsistent with the nucleosynthesis predicted for pn progenitors , which generally synthesize c , n , and he , but not o or ne .    in paper ii",
    ", we show that the difference between forbidden - line and recombination - line abundances in pne is inversely correlated with the nebular emission measure and diameter : in compact , high - surface - brightness pne the forbidden lines and recombination lines give essentially identical abundances , while large , low - surface - brightness pne show large abundance discrepancies .",
    "this result suggests that the discrepancy between forbidden lines and recombination lines is apparent only when a pn is large and evolved .",
    "it is difficult to imagine why hydrogen - depleted knots would condense out of the pn only at late times .",
    "if hydrogen - depleted clumps were present in the ejected envelope one would expect them to be present at early times as well .",
    "evaporation of grains from dense globules can not produce the smr clumps required  enhanced recombination lines are seen not only for o and c , but also for n and ne , which largely do not condense onto grains .",
    "one possibility is a clumpy stellar wind from an h - poor central star , and indeed , the central star of ngc 6153 shows o vi emission indicating an h - depleted wind .",
    "however , as noted above , the ring nebula central star is h - rich .",
    "obviously , a better understanding of the ejection and clumping of material in the nebula is needed to determine if this model can successfully account for pn emission .",
    "an obvious consequence of the smr knot model is that one might expect to see strong  recombination lines associated with the presence of dense knots .",
    "numerous small cometary knots have been observed in the helix nebula ngc 7293 @xcite , and have been identified as elongated , dense , dusty globules with a surface photoilluminated by the central star @xcite .",
    "their origin has not been determined yet , and spectroscopic data on physical conditions and metallicities are not yet available .",
    "however , they ( or the shadow regions behind them ) are logical places to look for emission anomalies , such as enhanced recombination line emission .    imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "has revealed the presence of dusty , possibly cometary , knots in the ring nebula as well .",
    "we have extracted wfpc-2 images of the ring nebula from the _ hst _ archive ( taken under program go-7632 ) .",
    "we obtained images in f502n ( [ ] @xmath15007 ) , f658n ( [ ] @xmath16584 ) , and f469n (  @xmath14686 )",
    ". the three individual exposures in each filter were combined and mosaiced after removing cosmic rays and image defects .",
    "we combined the final filter images to highlight the dusty globules .",
    "( the stsci office of public outreach web site oposite.stsci.edu has a nice color image of the ring nebula which clearly shows the dusty knots . )",
    "we rotated the image so that the e - w direction was aligned with the horizontal axis , and overlaid our spectrograph slit on the image .",
    "the upper panel of figure 9 shows a negative composite image of ngc 6720 in the f469n , f502n , and f658n filters , with our slit outlined .",
    "numerous dusty knots are seen in this image , beginning about 20@xmath0 from the central star .",
    "high - resolution ir imaging of ngc 6720 shows that bright h@xmath44 s(1 ) emission follows the rings of dusty knots @xcite , indicating the presence of neutral and molecular material as well .    the lower panel in figure 9 shows the distribution of o@xmath3/h@xmath8 across this section of the ring .",
    "comparison with the upper panel shows that the peak of the recombination line emission does not coincide with the region of dusty knots , but rather lies interior to the rings of knots .",
    "the discrepancy between the abundance derived from  and that derived from [ ] is largest in the innermost regions and is declining in the regions where the dusty knots are seen .",
    "although the spatial resolution of our spectrum is poor compared to the _ hst _ imaging , we conclude that the knots observed in the ring are not the primary source for the enhanced recombination emission .",
    "any metal - rich knots of the kind proposed by @xcite must be largely invisible at _ hst _ resolution .",
    "we show in paper ii ( also dinerstein , lafon & garnett 2000 and garnett & dinerstein 2001 ) that some  lines yield much larger o@xmath3 abundances than other lines .",
    "in particular , the 4590 , 4596   lines from multiplet 15 are especially strong .",
    "the levels that these lines arise from are populated mainly by dielectronic recombination ( dr ) .",
    "the large abundances obtained from these lines , even after taking into account the low - temperature dielectronic recombination rates @xcite , indicate that low - temperature dielectronic recombination at nebular temperatures does not account for the great strength of the lines .",
    "we therefore investigate the possibility that the dielectronic recombination rates in the affected pne could be severely underestimated . this could be the case if the rate coefficients to upper levels are grossly underestimated ( which does not seem very likely for all of the ions involved ) , or if there is a component of dielectronic recombination that is not accounted for in standard pn emission models .",
    "we hypothesize that this could be high - temperature dielectronic recombination in a hot central bubble ; dielectronic recombination rates are enhanced by as much as a factor of ten at @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 k compared to the rates at nebular temperatures of @xmath5 10@xmath31 k @xcite .    the spatial distribution of  emission in our long - slit observations the ring nebula would appear to be consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the  lines are strongest just interior to the main shell , in the region where the interface between a hot bubble and the denser ionized shell would be expected .",
    "the spatial profile of the  emission peak is fairly broad , perhaps broader than might be expected from such a transition layer ; however , we have not accounted for the relatively low spatial resolution of the spectra nor for the effects of nebular geometry .",
    "unfortunately , no x - ray images of the ring nebula exist , so we have no information on the presence or absence of hot gas",
    ".    at what temperature would the recombination coefficient be large enough to account for the increased emission ?",
    "let us assume that the  emission in the main shell represents the intrinsic o@xmath3 abundance of ( 7@xmath191)@xmath1010@xmath35 , at a temperature of 10,000 k. the maximum derived o@xmath3 abundance is ( 24@xmath192)@xmath1010@xmath35 , or about 3.5 times the abundance in the shell .",
    "equality of abundance would then imply that the recombination coefficient in the inner nebula is higher by the same factor .",
    "based on the theoretical recombination coefficients tabulated by @xcite , this is true if the material producing the excess  emission is at @xmath4 @xmath5 65,000 k. similarly , the c@xmath3 abundance in the inner nebula is about twice as large as that in the shell .",
    "the recombination rate for  @xmath45  is a factor two larger at @xmath4 @xmath5 35,000 k than the rate at 10,000 k. on the other hand , @xcite points out that the high-@xmath4 dr rate from these ls - coupling calculations may be underestimated by perhaps a factor of 1.5 - 2 because of missing autoionizing levels , which would act in favor of our model .",
    "one difficulty that arises is that any o@xmath3 ions recombining in this hot zone would be expected to emit very strongly in [ ] and a large increase in @xmath7 and in the forbidden line strengths might be observed .",
    "this problem could be mitigated if the density in the hot zone is very small ; the contribution to [ ] emission from the hot zone would then be overwhelmed by the strong emission from the main shell .",
    "we can check this by comparing the collisional excitation rates for [ ] with the recombination rates as a function of temperature . for the enhanced dr model to work",
    ", two conditions must be satisfied : first , there must be a temperature regime in which the recombination rate @xmath46 increases faster with increasing @xmath7 than the collisional excitation rate @xmath47 , at temperatures where dr dominates ; and second , there must be a temperature regime in which @xmath46/@xmath47 exceeds the value of this ratio at 10,000 k , the electron temperature we measure in the shell of the ring .",
    "figure 10 shows the results of a comparison of recombination rates to collisonal excitation rates for o@xmath3 , where we plot @xmath48 vs temperature for both [ ] @xmath494959,5007 and @xmath14363 .",
    "here we have computed the total recombination rate and assumed that the effective recombination rates to individual levels scale identically .",
    "we used the radiative recombination rates formulated by @xcite , together with the dielectronic recombination rates from @xcite and @xcite to estimate @xmath46 .",
    "the collisional rates @xmath50 were computed using the averaged temperature - dependent collision strengths of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "figure 10 shows that while the first condition listed above is met , the second is not .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath46 does increase faster than @xmath47 in the range 4.4 @xmath51 log @xmath4 @xmath51 5.5 . on the other hand , while we do see that @xmath46/@xmath47(@xmath494959,5007 ) for log @xmath4 = 5.1 - 5.7 exceeds the ratio at 10@xmath31 k , the largest difference is only about 0.1 dex .",
    "this is not nearly enough to explain the large difference between recombination line abundances and forbidden line abundances in ngc 6720 .",
    "furthermore , figure 10 shows us that for log @xmath4 @xmath52 4.5 @xmath46/@xmath47(@xmath14363 ) never exceeds the value at 10@xmath31 k. in order for this model to work , the theoretical dr rates would have to be increased by a large factor , which appears to be outside the estimated uncertainties in current dr rate calculations .",
    "we are thus forced at the present time to conclude that the recombination / collisonal excitation ratio can not be increased sufficiently by the presence of hot gas , for any combination of gas temperatures , to account for the observations , at least with conventional physics .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that the  and [ ] lines in the ring nebula have distinctly different spatial distributions in the nebula ; similar results have been found by @xcite for ngc 6153 .",
    "the permitted line emission peaks closer to the central star than the forbidden line emission .",
    "this spatial distribution appears to be inconsistent with a model in which the permitted lines arise mainly from radiative recombination of o@xmath3 in the transition zone to o@xmath8 in the bright shell . in order to force the abundances from the [ ] lines to agree with those derived from",
    "would require such large temperature fluctuations that it would be difficult to hide them .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to reconcile large temperature fluctuations with the good agreement between optical and far - ir measurements of forbidden lines in ngc 6153 .",
    "thus , it appears clear that temperature fluctuations can not account for most of the discrepancy between forbidden - line and recombination - line abundances in planetary nebulae .    nor",
    "do we find that c@xmath3 and o@xmath3 derived from the optical recombination lines have similar overabundances relative to those obtained from the collisionally - excited lines in the ring nebula .",
    "comparing our c@xmath3 abundance with that obtained by @xcite from the uv ] lines , we find that the rl abundance for c@xmath3 is about a factor of two higher , while for o@xmath3 the rls give an abundance that is a factor of four higher than that derived from [ ] .",
    "thus it appears that the cause of the abundance discrepancy need not apply equally to all of the species .",
    "based on the enhanced strengths of  multiplet 15 , the correlation of the abundance discrepancy with nebular size ( paper ii , garnett & dinerstein 2001 ) , and the spatial distribution of the  emission , we proposed that dielectronic recombination in a hot gas bubble might greatly enhance the emission rates of the permitted lines above the rates at nebular temperatures .",
    "a comparison of recombination rates versus collisional excitation rates for o@xmath3 showed , however , that the increase in recombination rates due to dielectronic recombination at @xmath7 @xmath5 10@xmath6 k is not enough to overcome the increase in collisionally - excited emission .",
    "unless the theoretical dr rates are greatly underestimated , this does not appear to be a viable explanation for the recombination line - forbidden line discrepancy . in any case",
    ", our results suggest that we need to understand better the effects of dr on recombination line strengths in general .    a model in which the recombination emission arises mainly in cold , h - depleted clumps @xcite could explain the enhanced recombination line emission in pne , although we are unable to find a close correlation between enhanced  emission and the locations of dusty globules in the ring nebula .",
    "furthermore , we would also need to understand why such clumps are only seen in the larger , more evolved pne . perhaps this is a selection effect related to the surface brightness .",
    "spectroscopy and imaging with high spatial resolution of other pne should provide more clues to the nature of the relation between recombination line enhancement and nebular diameter .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to convincingly reconcile any of the proposed models to explain the rl enhancements with all of the observations of ngc 6720 and ngc 6153 .",
    "we present our results here in the hope that it will inspire new thinking on the physics behind emission processes in photoionized nebulae .",
    "what are the consequences for abundance measurements from forbidden lines ?",
    "the results are a bit mixed at the present time .",
    "the agreement in abundances derived from optical / uv forbidden lines and ir lines measured by @xmath39 for ngc 6153 @xcite offers strong evidence that temperature fluctuations do not have sufficient magnitude to significantly affect forbidden - line abundances . on the other hand",
    ", there is a significant discrepancy between the balmer discontinuity temperature and the [ ] temperature in ngc 6153 .",
    "it is possible that this discrepancy merely reflects variations in temperature across the nebula .",
    "as we have seen , the [ ] temperature is not constant across the ring nebula , and such a variation is expected based on ionization models",
    ". a detailed observational study of the spatial profile of various temperature indicators across nebulae would provide a clearer picture of the temperature variation within planetary nebulae .",
