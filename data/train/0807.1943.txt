    "the failure of antibiotic treatments to eliminate bacterial infections has become both more evident and better understood in the past several decades . although there is evidence that the over use of antibiotics has amplified the number of chromosomal - resistant bacteria @xcite , it is becoming increasingly clear that there are other mechanisms that protect populations of bacteria",
    ". many of these mechanisms depend on whether the bacteria exist in a biofilm or not @xcite .",
    "in particular , the notion that small sub - populations of bacteria may display innate tolerance to various biocides has been proposed as a possible reason for the failure of treatment for bacterial infections @xcite .",
    "bacteria within a biofilm are enmeshed in a physical gel that provides a secondary boundary that may allow small numbers of bacteria to evade the antibiotic ; therefore , the failure to eliminate the entire population can allow the population to regrow .    it should be noted that populations of planktonic bacteria also contain these highly tolerant or persister cells @xcite . thus understanding the process of persister formation and the response of the population to biocidal application is fundamental to developing dosing protocols and treatments in both batch culture and biofilm populations .    as in many areas of biology",
    ", mathematical modeling has been used as a counterpart to experimental observations . because there are several hypotheses regarding the mechanism of persister formation",
    ", mathematical modeling can be used to provide insight into the success of failure of treatment protocols as well as the consistency of various hypotheses .",
    "currently , there are at least two distinct hypotheses concerning persister formation - one of which is senescence . in this case ,",
    "persister cells are assumed to be those that have undergone many division cycles .",
    "it is known that asymmetric division leads to degradation of parts of the cellular machinery that may be the underlying cause of persistence @xcite .",
    "mathematical analysis of a model of senescence has been described in both chemostat and biofilm settings @xcite .",
    "a different hypothesis argues that persisters are a phenotype that is expressed at a rate that depends on the external environment .",
    "although the biological details are not well understood , it is thought that this might be due to toxin / antitoxin interaction or some other stress response @xcite .",
    "this has been investigated mathematically as well @xcite . in @xcite , a very simple model of persister formation",
    "was developed and optimal dosing protocols , that entail alternating application and resting , were described . in @xcite ,",
    "toxin / antitoxin interaction was explicitly included and the resulting model was analyzed in a chemostat . in both of these investigations",
    "only one particular form of the kinetics was analyzed .",
    "one of the goals of the current investigation is to extend these results to a more general form for kinetics .",
    "this is an important process , because it has been shown that not only is there a successful dosing protocol , there is an optimal protocol . without knowing how robust the model is",
    ", there is no way to determine how robust the conclusions are .",
    "here we take a model of the form proposed in @xcite and give a condition that yields successful dosing protocols , at least for some initial makeups of the population .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : we begin by describing the model for the dynamics of the bacterial population in response to antibiotic challenge .",
    "we then develop the theory by analyzing two extreme cases ( no dosing and constant dosing ) and the intermediate case .",
    "this leads to a local sufficient condition for treatment success .",
    "next we give a condition for global treatment failure , supported by numerical simulations of the model .",
    "we also show that the speed of eradication does not necessarily depend monotonically on the duration of the administration of the antibiotic .",
    "consider the following chemostat model : @xmath0b_s+k_g(t)b_p\\label{s1}\\\\ { \\dot b_p}&=&k_l(t)f(s)b_s-[k_g(t)+d]b_p\\label{s2}\\\\ { \\dot s}&=&d(s^0-s)-\\frac{f(s)b_s}{y}\\label{s3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the concentration of the cells which are susceptible to antibiotics , @xmath2 is the concentration of the persister cells which are not affected by the antibiotic and @xmath3 is the concentration of the nutrient .",
    "this model deviates from the one in @xcite because it is a chemostat model , which is reflected in the additional loss terms at rate @xmath4 ( called the dilution rate or washout rate ) , and the inflow ( at the same rate @xmath4 ) of nutrient with an input concentration @xmath5 .",
    "the per capita growth rate of the susceptible cells is denoted by @xmath6 , for which we assume the following throughout the rest of the paper : @xmath7 the persister cells do not consume nutrient , hence the lack of a corresponding growth term in the @xmath2-equation .",
    "the conversion of nutrient into new biomass occurs with a yield of @xmath8 .",
    "the remaining functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are non - negative , time - varying functions which describe the effect of antibiotics on the population .",
    "first , @xmath11 is the killing rate of the susceptible population .",
    "note in particular that the killing rate is proportional to the growth rate of the cells .",
    "it is positive when both antibiotic and nutrient are present , but zero when either one is missing .",
    "secondly , @xmath12 is the rate at which susceptible cells switch to persister cells .",
    "it is also positive when antibiotic is present , but zero when this is not the case .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is the rate at which persister cells revert to the susceptible state when antibiotic is absent ( and zero when antibiotic is present ) .",
    "since antibiotics are administered to the reactor vessel in a controlled ( lab ) environment , we will make the simplifying assumption that the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath13-periodic ( for some given @xmath14 ) , and of the bang - bang type with simultaneous switching instances : for some @xmath15 $ ] , and for positive parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , there holds that @xmath18 thus , antibiotics are present during a fraction @xmath19 of the period @xmath13 , and absent during the remaining fraction @xmath20 of the period .",
    "clearly , this is a simplification of reality because the concentration of an antibiotic is not expected to be of the bang - bang type . in a more realistic model",
    ", the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 would be replaced by functions depending on ( at least ) a new state variable for the concentration of the antibiotic , and the periodicity would arise through a periodic forcing term in the equation for this new variable .",
    "we leave the study of such a model to the future .    throughout the rest of this paper",
    "we assume that the net effect of the antibiotic alone is lethal to the susceptible population : @xmath23 note that this assumption is valid for the parameter values related to the experiments described in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate how the behavior of system @xmath24 with @xmath25 changes qualitatively in terms of @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we collect a couple of basic results concerning the dynamical behavior of @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "for a real - valued function @xmath26 , we denote the extended real numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "[ dissipative ] system @xmath24 with @xmath25 has @xmath31 as a forward invariant set , and it is dissipative .",
    "the first assertion is obvious .",
    "dissipativity follows by considering the dynamics of @xmath32 given by @xmath33 and hence @xmath34    not only are all state components of every solution ultimately bounded from above by some constant which does not depend on initial conditions , we also notice in the following lemma , that @xmath35 is ultimately bounded from below by some positive constant which is independent of initial conditions .",
    "[ lower ] there is a constant @xmath36 such that for all solutions of @xmath24 with @xmath25 , there holds that @xmath37 .",
    "consider the function @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 is increasing with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , hence by the intermediate value theorem , there is a unique @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "we will show that @xmath37 .",
    "if not , then since @xmath44 by the proof of lemma @xmath45 , it follows from corollary @xmath46 in @xcite -a consequence of the famous fluctuation lemma- applied to @xmath47 that @xmath48\\\\ & \\geq & d(s^0-s_{\\infty})-f(s_{\\infty})s^0\\\\ & > & d(s^0-\\theta)-f(\\theta)s^0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which contradicts that @xmath43 .",
    "first we study the cases where antibiotic is either present or absent for all times .",
    "our conclusions are the expected ones : when antibiotic is present continuously , all susceptible cells are killed , and consequently the persisters die out as well since they can only survive if susceptible cells become persisters .",
    "when the population is never exposed to antibiotics , then all persisters revert to the susceptible state , and ultimately the population will consist entirely of susceptible cells ( provided the dilution rate is not too high ) .    [ extreme ]    1 .   case @xmath50 ( * continuous antibiotic dosing * ) .",
    "the steady state @xmath51 of system @xmath24 with @xmath25 is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "2 .   case @xmath49 ( * never antibiotic dosing * ) . if @xmath52 , then all solutions @xmath53 with @xmath54 converge to the steady state @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the unique positive value satisfying @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .    1 .   if @xmath50 , then @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",
    "by @xmath63 it follows that for all solutions , @xmath64 , and hence @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests that we should study the linear limiting system @xmath67 whose solutions clearly converge to @xmath68 .",
    "the conclusion now follows immediately by applying theorem f.1 in @xcite .",
    "2 .   if @xmath49 , then @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath62 .",
    "then the restriction on the initial condition implies that @xmath71 for all @xmath72 .",
    "notice that @xmath73 as @xmath66 , suggesting we should study the limiting system @xmath74b_s\\\\ { \\dot s}&=&d(s^0-s)-\\frac{f(s)b_s}{y}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the classical chemostat model of a single cell population growing on a single nutrient , described in @xcite : all solutions with @xmath75 converge to @xmath76 under the assumptions of the lemma .",
    "the conclusion follows again by theorem f.1 in @xcite .",
    "in this section we deal with the @xmath13-periodic model @xmath24 with @xmath25 , assuming that @xmath78 .",
    "we will also assume that the dilution rate is not too large , as in lemma @xmath79 : @xmath80    notice that system @xmath24 with @xmath25 has a steady state @xmath81 , regardless of the value of @xmath19 . to determine its stability properties , we determine the @xmath13-periodic variational equation at @xmath82 : @xmath83 and the floquet multipliers of this system are @xmath84 ( which is of course inside the unit circle of the complex plane ) and the floquet multipliers of @xmath85 using @xmath25 , these floquet multipliers are the eigenvalues of the following matrix : @xmath86 where @xmath87 are triangular , quasimonotone matrices .",
    "notice also that @xmath88 is hurwitz by @xmath63 , and that @xmath89 has one negative and one positive eigenvalue by @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath88 and @xmath89 are quasi - monotone ( i.e. their off - diagonal entries are all non - negative ) , it follows that their matrix exponentials are ( entry - wise ) non - negative , triangular matrices and then their product @xmath91 is a ( entry - wise ) positive matrix whose spectral radius @xmath92 is an eigenvalue by the perron - frobenius theorem@xcite .",
    "consequently , to determine stability of @xmath82 , we need to establish whether or not @xmath92 is inside the unit circle : if @xmath93 , then @xmath82 is locally asymptotically stable .",
    "if @xmath94 , then @xmath82 is unstable .",
    "summarizing , we have established    [ loc - stab ] let @xmath77 , and assume that @xmath90 holds .",
    "then the steady state @xmath95 is locally stable for @xmath24 with @xmath25 if @xmath93 , but unstable if @xmath94 .",
    "our main concern is knowing how @xmath92 varies as a continuous function of @xmath19 ( this variation is continuous since eigenvalues of a matrix are continuous functions of its entries , and clearly the entries of @xmath91 are continuous in @xmath19 ) .",
    "for @xmath49 ( never using antibiotic ) , and hence also for @xmath19 near @xmath96 by continuity of @xmath92 , we have that @xmath97 .",
    "this is in accordance with lemma @xmath79 , where it was shown that all solutions with @xmath54 converge to @xmath98 , and thus @xmath95 must be unstable . for @xmath50",
    "( using antibiotic continuously ) , and hence also for @xmath19 near @xmath99 , we have that @xmath100 .",
    "this is in accordance with lemma @xmath79 as well because it was shown there that all solutions converge to @xmath82 in this case .",
    "we can actually determine the dependence of @xmath92 on @xmath19 explicitely because fortunately , both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are diagonalizable ( their eigenvalues are distinct ) , which simplifies the computation of their matrix exponentials somewhat .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 and thus using @xmath104 that @xmath105 a lengthy algebraic calculation shows that the positive matrix @xmath106 is given by @xmath107}\\\\ & & + k_gk_l\\left({\\operatorname{e}}^{(1-p)\\tau ( f(s^0)-d)}- { \\operatorname{e}}^{-(1-p)\\tau ( k_g+d ) } \\right)\\left({\\operatorname{e}}^{-p\\tau d}-{\\operatorname{e}}^{p\\tau [ ( 1-k_d - k_l)f(s^0)-d ] } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath108 @xmath109 } \\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a positive constant , independent of @xmath19 .    since @xmath91 is a positive matrix , its spectral radius",
    "can now be calculated explicitly in terms of its entries : @xmath112",
    "in this section we show that the spectral radius @xmath92 also plays a key role in the global behavior of system @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath77 . we will show that if @xmath94 , then not only is @xmath82 unstable as we have shown in theorem @xmath113 , but treatment fails globally , because both cell populations persist uniformly .",
    "in addition we will show that there are positive periodic solutions .",
    "[ main - persist ] let @xmath77 , and assume that @xmath90 holds .",
    "if @xmath94 , then treatment fails and the population is uniformly persistent , i.e. there is some @xmath114 ( independent of initial conditions ) , such that all solutions of @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath75 , have the property that : @xmath115 moreover , there are @xmath13-periodic solutions @xmath116 with @xmath117 for all @xmath62",
    ".    define the following matrix : @xmath118 where @xmath119 notice that @xmath120 , and thus since @xmath94 , it follows that @xmath121 as well , because the spectral radius of any matrix is continuous with respect to its entries .",
    "we fix some @xmath122 such that @xmath123 holds .",
    "we will first show that @xmath1 is uniformly weakly persistent , i.e. that there is some @xmath124 such that if @xmath75 , then @xmath125 . by contradiction , if @xmath1 is not uniformly weakly persistent , then there is some solution @xmath53 with @xmath75 such that @xmath126    by corollary @xmath46 in @xcite applied to @xmath127 , and since @xmath128 by @xmath127 , we have that @xmath129\\\\ & \\geq&d(s^0-s_{\\infty})- \\frac{f(s^0)b_s^{\\infty}}{y},\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence by @xmath130 that @xmath131 thus , for some @xmath132 , there holds that @xmath133 for all @xmath134 .",
    "it follows from @xmath135 , that for all @xmath134 : @xmath136 where the vector inequalities should be interpreted componentwise .",
    "notice that the vector field on the right - hand side of @xmath137 is that of a @xmath13-periodic , cooperative linear system whose principal fundamental matrix solution evaluated over one period @xmath13 equals @xmath138 . by kamke s comparison theorem ( see e.g. theorem b.1 in appendix b of @xcite ) it follows that for all @xmath134 , the vector @xmath139 is not smaller ( component - wise ) than the solution starting in @xmath140 of the @xmath13-periodic , cooperative linear system with vector field given in the right - hand side of @xmath137 . but all non - zero , non - negative solutions of the linear system diverge because @xmath141 . then so does @xmath142 , and this contradicts @xmath130 .",
    "we have thus shown that @xmath1 is uniformly weakly persistent .",
    "next we establish that @xmath1 is in fact uniformly strongly persistent .",
    "this follows from theorem @xmath143 in @xcite , applied to the map @xmath144 which maps @xmath145 to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the map @xmath144 is continuous and maps @xmath150 into itself , and it has a global attractor because it is compact and dissipative .",
    "it follows that there is some @xmath151 , independent of initial conditions , such that if @xmath75 , then @xmath152 , and also that @xmath153 by theorem @xmath154 in @xcite .",
    "next we show that uniform strong persistence of @xmath1 , implies uniform strong persistence of @xmath2 .",
    "consider equation @xmath47 and notice that for all sufficiently large @xmath62 : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the positive constant from lemma @xmath157 .",
    "it is not hard to show that the linear equation @xmath158 has a positive @xmath13-periodic solution @xmath159 and that all non - negative solutions converge to it .",
    "therefore , it follows that for all sufficiently large @xmath62 , @xmath160 establishing uniform strong persistence for @xmath2 , since @xmath161 is independent of initial conditions .",
    "we conclude the proof of uniform strong persistence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by setting @xmath162 .    finally , to show that there are @xmath13-periodic solutions with @xmath163 , we apply theorem @xmath164 from @xcite applied to the continuous map @xmath144 defined above . we have already remarked that this map is continuous , maps @xmath150 into itself , is dissipative and compact , and we have just proved that it is uniformly strongly persistent with respect to @xmath165 .",
    "observe also that @xmath150 is relatively open in @xmath166 , and that @xmath150 is convex .",
    "then by theorem @xmath164 from @xcite , the map @xmath144 has a fixed point in @xmath150 , and this in turn implies the existence of @xmath13-periodic solutions with @xmath71 for @xmath24 . the same argument as the one used above to establish uniform strong persistence of @xmath167 , shows that these @xmath13-periodic solutions are such that @xmath168 as well .",
    "we use the following numerical values : the per capita growth rate is of michaelis - menten type : @xmath169 and the parameters @xmath170    the chemostat setting requires that we specify two additional parameters : @xmath171 it can be easily verified that these choices satisfy the conditions @xmath63 and @xmath90 .",
    "note that there is no need to specify the yield coefficient @xmath172 in order to calculate @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , the matrix @xmath91 in @xmath104 does not depend on @xmath172 .",
    "the graph of the spectral radius @xmath92 in terms of @xmath19 , determined using formula @xmath173 , is given in figure @xmath174 .",
    "we see that @xmath175 when @xmath19 is approximately equal to @xmath176 . clearly , @xmath92 is not monotone , and it has a global mimimum of approximately @xmath177 which is achieved at @xmath178 ( determined numerically using mathematica ) .",
    "thus , the optimal strategy in a dosing experiment with a period of @xmath179 hours occurs for a dosing duration of @xmath180 hours .",
    "here , optimality means that eradication happens as quickly as possible .     for @xmath181 $ ] ( @xmath182 , other parameters in text.),width=453 ]    let us also illustrate what happens if @xmath19 equals approximately @xmath183 .",
    "then @xmath92 equals approximately @xmath184 , implying that treatment fails .",
    "it appears that the solution of @xmath24 with @xmath185 ( and all other parameters as above ) starting from the initial condition @xmath186 converges to a @xmath13-periodic solution , see figures @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "these observations are in accordance with theorem @xmath189 .
