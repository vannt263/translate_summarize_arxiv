    "it is generally believed that the quantum field theory of self - coupled scalar fields in four dimensions is trivial .",
    "then all effects of interaction terms go away in the true continuum limit .",
    "this is certainly true in perturbation theory due to the universal positivity of the perturbative @xmath1-function at small coupling ( see section [ betasst ] for more details ) . in this framework one",
    "also understands that there is a range of values for the mass and self - coupling such that in the effective theory at finite cutoff there can be both substantial interaction and only tiny cutoff effects in physical quantities referring to energies much smaller than the cutoff .",
    "this is the reason why the appearance of a scalar higgs field in the standard model may not really be in conflict with triviality .",
    "turned around , triviality even implies order of magnitude bounds for parameters in the higgs sector .",
    "there also is the logical possibility that scalar theories could have sectors for which perturbation theory is simply irrelevant . in a series of papers that began with @xcite lscher and weisz",
    "have provided a lot of evidence that in the standard lattice formulation of the theory there is no such nonperturbative sector for low energy observables , which was also confirmed early on by monte carlo simulation @xcite . in most numerical investigations",
    "the four dimensional ising model is simulated which arises as the infinite bare coupling limit of @xmath0 theory . while it is plausible that this is the ` least trivial ' case the main reason for this choice is the availability of particularly efficient simulation methods like the cluster algorithm employed in @xcite .    triggered by @xcite a further boost in efficiency",
    "could be realized for ising simulations .",
    "the simulation strategy of prokofev and svistunov consists of sampling certain strong coupling graphs to arbitrary order instead of spin configurations . for arbitrary finite systems the expansion converges and the two representations are equivalent .",
    "the authors propose a simple update scheme for the graph ensembles which does practically not suffer from critical slowing down .",
    "this was elaborated in @xcite by showing that there are in addition dramatically improved estimators available for two - point correlations .",
    "a further step was made in @xcite where it was noted that the simulated strong coupling form coincides with the random current representation constructed by aizenman @xcite .",
    "he has proved correlation identities that allowed him to rigorously prove triviality for the ising model with more than four dimensions ( excluding however @xmath2 ) .",
    "a decisive achievement was a combinatoric construction of an estimator for the _ connected _ four - point function that analytically subtracts the disconnected part and then could be bounded sharply enough . in the numerical approach at tracing the renormalized interaction strength @xcite the corresponding cancellation had to be performed numerically which leads to much reduced precision . in @xcite aizenman",
    "s identity could be integrated into a numerical framework by simulating two replica and identifying the required percolation clusters .",
    "it was demonstrated to lead to precise estimates of renormalized couplings with only moderate computing power in dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "the question of triviality is an issue of ultraviolet renormalization . in numerical simulations at @xmath2 one is limited to ratios @xmath4 at present , where @xmath5 stands for the lattice spacing and @xmath6 is the system size . to investigate ultraviolet behavior close to the continuum limit",
    "a clever use of resources is achieved if one uses @xmath6 itself as the scale to formulate renormalization conditions , i.e. to use a finite volume scheme as one does with the schrdinger functional in qcd .",
    "such a strategy - on a simple periodic torus  was in fact followed in @xcite by fixing @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the renormalized mass in the so - called second moment definition .",
    "it turned out that the first series of experiments at @xmath9 led to a borderline agreement with perturbation theory : the leading order ( one loop ) described well the cutoff evolution of the renormalized coupling .",
    "the inclusion of two further orders of the asymptotic expansion however led away from the data .",
    "this situation was further investigated in @xcite with the following results : at @xmath10 , closer to the thermodynamic limit , perturbation theory works as expected yielding a successively improving precise description of the numerical data for the available three orders . for smaller systems",
    "it was argued that the single constant zero momentum mode is responsible for the bad ` convergence ' of perturbation theory .",
    "this was supported by finding that an improved expansion , where this mode was treated exactly , yields a much better agreement with the data also at @xmath9 and even for @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    "we have eliminated the constant mode by introducing antiperiodic boundary conditions in one or several directions of the four dimensional torus .",
    "our new results here consist of generalizing the strong coupling / random current formulation to these cases including a proof of aizenman s identities in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we define several finite size renormalization schemes and report values of the corresponding three loop @xmath1-function coefficients . in section 4 numerical results for the antiperiodic case",
    "are reported followed by some conclusions .",
    "some details of the proof of the aizenman formula and of the perturbative calculations are deferred to appendices .",
    "we here generalize the content of @xcite while we at the same time slightly change the notation .",
    "we now start from the partition function @xmath12 = 2^{- l^4 } \\sum_s { \\mathrm{e}}^{2 \\kappa \\sum_{l = \\langle x y \\rangle } z    ( l ) s ( x ) s ( y ) } \\prod_x ( s ( x))^{q ( x ) } .",
