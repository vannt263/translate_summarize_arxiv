    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound systems and the most important link to the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "the detailed properties of clusters , such as the distributions of their various mass constituents - dark matter , hot intracluster ( ic ) gas , and galaxies - dynamics , and thermal structure , are of much interest both intrinsically , and for the understanding of the formation and evolution of the lss .",
    "moreover , detailed _ astrophysical _ knowledge of clusters is essential for their use as _ precise _ cosmological probes to measure global parameters , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , & @xmath4 , and parameters characterising the primordial density fluctuation field .",
    "recent observations of many clusters of galaxies with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ satellites at energies @xmath5 kev , have significantly advanced our knowledge of the morphology and thermal structure of hot ic gas , the source of the cluster thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the improved determinations of the gas temperature , density , and metal abundances from these observations significantly improve estimates of such important quantities as the total cluster mass and its gaseous and baryonic mass fractions .    as has been the case in galaxies , in clusters too a more physically complete understanding of these systems necessitates knowledge also of non - thermal ( nt ) quantities and phenomena in the ic space .",
    "observational evidence for the relevance of these phenomena in clusters comes mostly from measurements of extended regions of radio emission , and from faraday rotation ( fr ) of the plane of polarisation of radio sources seen through ( or inside ) clusters .",
    "since the observed radio emission is clearly synchrotron - produced , its level and spectrum yield direct information on ic relativistic electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "information on cluster magnetic fields ( separately from relativistic electron properties ) is obtained also from fr measurements .",
    "compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the radio - emitting relativistic electrons boosts photon energies to the x - and-@xmath6 regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the search for cluster nt x - ray emission has begun long ago @xcite , but first clear indications for emission at energies @xmath7 kev came only after deep dedicated observations of a few clusters with the _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ satellites ( beginning with analyses of observations of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "radio and nt x - ray observations provide quantitative measures of very appreciable magnetic fields and relativistic electron densities in the observed clusters .",
    "these results open a new dimension in the study of clusters .",
    "this is a review of cluster nt x - ray observations and their direct implications , including prospects for the detection of @xmath6-ray emission .",
    "the literature on cluster nt phenomena is ( perhaps somewhat surprisingly ) quite extensive , including several reviews of radio emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and cluster magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a review of the current status of radio observations by @xcite - chapter 6 , this volume . in order to properly address the comparison between magnetic field values deduced from radio observations and jointly from nt x - ray and radio measurements , we include here a brief summary of cluster radio observations .",
    "measurements of euv emission in a few clusters , and claims that this emission is by energetic electrons , are reviewed by @xcite - chapter 4 , this volume",
    ". nt radiation processes are reviewed by @xcite - chapter 10 , this volume , and relevant aspects of particle acceleration mechanisms are reviewed by @xcite - chapter 11 , this volume .",
    "measurements of synchrotron radio emission at several frequencies usually provide the first evidence for the presence of a significant population of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "this has been the prime evidence for ic fields and electrons .",
    "in addition , faraday rotation ( fr ) of the plane of polarisation of radiation from cluster and background radio galaxies has provided mostly statistical evidence for ic magnetic fields .",
    "main results from these very different sets of observations are briefly reviewed in the next two subsections .      in clusters",
    "the task of actually determining that the observed emission is from extended ic regions is quite challenging , since high resolution observations of the various discrete radio sources ( that are mostly in the member galaxies ) are required , in addition to the ( lower resolution ) observations of the extended low brightness emission .",
    "the truly extended emission is mapped upon subtraction of the respective contributions of these sources to the spectral flux .",
    "observations of extended radio emission had begun some 50 years ago with measurements of coma c in the central region of the coma cluster by @xcite , followed by various other measurements at frequencies in the range @xmath8 ghz , including the first detailed study at @xmath9 mhz and @xmath10 mhz by @xcite .",
    "appreciable effort has been devoted to measure extended emission regions in clusters , which has resulted in the mapping of centrally located ( ` halo ' ) and other ( ` relic ' ) regions in about 50 clusters .",
    "some 32 of these were found in a vla survey @xcite of 205 nearby clusters in the aco catalogue , only about a dozen of these were previously known to have regions of extended radio emission .",
    "primary interest ( certainly to us here ) is in the former sources , which constitute a truly cluster phenomenon .",
    "a central extended radio region ( which is somewhat inappropriately referred to as ` halo ' ) typically has a size of @xmath11 mpc , and a luminosity in the range @xmath12 ergs@xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) over the frequency band @xmath15 ghz . with radio indices usually in the range @xmath11 ,",
    "the emission is appreciably steeper than that of ( most ) radio galaxies .",
    "the clusters in which radio halos and relics have already been found include evolving systems with a substantial degree of subclustering , as well as well - relaxed clusters that seem to have attained hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "halo morphologies are also quite varied , from roughly circular ( projected ) configuration to highly irregular shape , as can be seen in the contour maps produced by @xcite .",
    "the spatial variety is reflected also in the wide distribution of values of the spectral index across the halo ; e.g. see the maps in @xcite .",
    "obviously , the magnetic field strength and relativistic electron density can not both be determined from radio measurements alone , unless it is assumed that they are related so both can be determined from a single observable .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the total energy density of particles ( mostly , protons and electrons ) is equal to that in the magnetic field .",
    "the validity of this equipartition assumption is not obvious , especially in clusters where the particles and fields may have different origins and evolutionary histories .",
    "moreover , the complex nature of the radio emission , and the expected significant variation of the magnetic field strength and relativistic electron density across a halo , imply that only rough estimates of these quantities can be obtained from measurements of the ( spectral ) flux integrated over the halo .",
    "when available , values of the halo mean equipartition field , @xmath16 , are also listed in table 1 ; generally , these substantially uncertain values are at the few @xmath17 g level .",
    "ic magnetic fields can also be estimated by measuring the statistical depolarisation and faraday rotation of the plane of polarisation of radiation from background radio sources seen through clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , and also from radio sources in the cluster .",
    "fr measurements sample the line of sight component of the randomly oriented ( and spatially dependent ) ic fields , weighted by the gas density , yielding a mean weighted value which we denote by @xmath18 .",
    "this quantity was estimated by analysing the rotation measure ( rm ) distribution of individual radio sources in several clusters , including cygnus  a @xcite , hydra  a @xcite , a  119 @xcite , a  400 , and a  2634 @xcite .",
    "analyses of fr measurements typically yield values of @xmath18 that are in the range of @xmath19 @xmath17 g .",
    "most fr studies are statistical , based on measurements of radio sources that are inside or behind clusters .",
    "an example is the work of @xcite , who determined the distribution of rm values with cluster - centric distance for 27 radio sources within or in the background ( 15 and 12 , respectively ) of 16 nearby clusters .",
    "analysis of this distribution ( including comparison with results for a control sample of radio sources seen outside the central regions of the clusters in the sample ) yielded a mean field value of @xmath20 @xmath17 g , where @xmath21 is a characteristic field spatial coherence ( reversal ) scale .",
    "in further work the sample of radio sources was significantly expanded ( to about 70 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in comparing different measures of the mean strength of ic fields it should be remembered that the selective sampling of locally enhanced fields in high gas density regions in cluster cores broadens the rm distribution , resulting in overestimation of the field mean strength .    deduced values of @xmath18 yield substantially uncertain estimates of the mean field across a halo .",
    "the major inherent uncertainties stem from the need to separate the several contributions to the total rm ( including that which is intrinsic to the radio source ) , the unknown tangled morphology of ic fields and their spatial variation across the cluster , as well as uncertainty in modelling the gas density profile .",
    "a discussion of these uncertainties , many aspects of which have already been assessed in some detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is out of the scope of our review .",
    "as has been noted long ago , compton scattering of the cmb by relativistic electrons boosts photon energies to the x - ray and @xmath6-ray regions .",
    "measurement of this radiation provides additional information that enables the determination of the electron density and mean magnetic field directly , _ without _ the need to invoke equipartition .",
    "the mean strength of the magnetic field which is deduced from the radio and nt x - ray fluxes , @xmath22 , is essentially a volume average over the emitting region .",
    "the detection of ic radio and nt x - ray emission sets the stage for a more meaningful study of the origin of magnetic fields and cosmic rays in extragalactic environments .",
    "the focus of this review are measurements of nt x - ray emission in large extended ic regions .",
    "nt emission is obviously predicted within dominant radio galaxies in the centres of clusters and in their radio halos .",
    "this emission has been sought in several galaxies including ngc  1275 in the perseus cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) and m  87 in virgo @xcite , but does not seem to have been detected .",
    "the mapping of the electron spectrum in these inner regions clearly provides crucial information on the initial source of ic relativistic electrons and most likely also energetic protons , whose energy input and heating of the gas could possibly be important in the inner core of perseus @xcite and other clusters .",
    "nt x - ray emission in these environments is quite complex due to its multi - source ( agn , jet , binaries , and halo ) , temporally variable nature .",
    "a discussion of nt emission in these essentially galactic environments is out of the scope of our review .    the prospects for measuring cluster nt x - ray emission motivated detailed calculations of the predicted emission @xcite .",
    "in these calculations the relativistic electron spectrum was directly related to the measured radio spectrum and no attempt was made to model the spectra of possible energetic electron populations .",
    "energetic protons , which are a major galactic cosmic ray component , are also expected in the ic space , particularly so in the inner cores of clusters dominated by a radio galaxy .",
    "their interactions with protons in the gas produce neutral and charged pions , whose decays yield @xmath6-ray emission and secondary electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "energetic protons also deposit energy and heat ic gas through their coulomb interactions with electrons and protons in the gas @xcite .    with mean field values in the range of @xmath23 @xmath17 g , the energy range of electrons emitting at the observed radio frequencies is @xmath24 gev .",
    "of course , electrons with energies outside this range are also expected , either as part of the same or a different population . in particular ,",
    "nt bremsstrahlung euv and x - ray emission by ( the more numerous ) lower energy electrons would also be expected @xcite .",
    "however , at energies below @xmath25 mev , the main energy loss is electronic excitations in the gas @xcite ; this sets a stringent limit on the contribution to the nt x - ray emission by a low energy electron population @xcite",
    ". we will therefore assume that nt x - ray emission is largely due to compton scattering of radio - emitting electrons by the cmb .",
    "the main characteristics of the predicted compton - produced emission are : ( a ) x - ray to radio flux ratio is roughly equal to the ratio of the cmb energy density to the magnetic field energy density .",
    "( b ) power - law index is nearly equal to the radio index .",
    "( c ) matching x - ray and radio centroids , with the x - ray spatial profile generally shallower than that of the radio emission .",
    "these features are expected only if the compton - produced emission is identified and separated from other contributions , the primary thermal emission as well as nt emission from relics and individual galaxies . due to source confusion , as well as other systematic and observational uncertainties ,",
    "spatial information is _ crucially _ needed in order to clearly identify the origin of nt x - ray emission .",
    "we first briefly summarise the required sensitivity and level of spatial resolution for the detection of nt emission , and then review the results of the search for this emission with the _ heao-1 _ , _ cgro _ , _ rxte _ , _ bepposax _ , _ suzaku _ , and _",
    "integral_.      cluster x - ray emission is primarily thermal up to @xmath26 kev ; therefore , clear identification of nt emission necessitates also precise measurement of the thermal emission in order to account for and separate it from the sought nt component .",
    "the required detector spectral range must therefore extend down to sufficiently low energies .    using standard expressions for compton and synchrotron emission from the same population of relativistic electrons ,",
    "the predicted level of compton - produced emission from nearby clusters with measured radio halos can be readily estimated .",
    "since imaging information at the high energy x - ray regime ( @xmath27 ) is minimal at best , we will ignore spatial factors in the compton - synchrotron formulae ( e.g. , @xcite ) that include integrals over the relativistic electron and magnetic fields spatial profiles .",
    "this is valid as long as the nt x - ray emission region coincides with the radio region .",
    "we base our estimate of the required detector sensitivity on the level of radio emission as measured in the nearby clusters with well measured halos ( such as coma , a  2256 , a  2319 ) , for which the feasibility of detection of the nt emission is likely to be highest . using the range of values for radio spectral index and flux",
    ", we estimate the level of nt flux at 40 kev to be typically @xmath28 @xmath29 s@xmath13kev@xmath13 and an integrated flux of @xmath30 @xmath29 s@xmath13 in the @xmath31 kev band , if the mean field ( across the emitting region ) is @xmath32 @xmath17 g .",
    "the value of the field is critical due to the strong @xmath33 dependence of the flux , with a power - law exponent typically larger than 2 .",
    "for example , the predicted flux in the coma cluster is some @xmath34 times lower if @xmath35 @xmath17 g .",
    "given the great difficulty in detecting the predicted nt flux at energies @xmath36 kev , it is only reasonable to search for it also at lower energies .",
    "to do so optimally would require a high - sensitivity detector that covers a wider spectral band than that of any previously flown instrument .",
    "combining measurements made with two different detectors is problematic , given the inherent difficulty in the requisite precise cross - calibration ( at the @xmath37  % level ) of signals from detectors on the same satellite , and even more so when the detectors were on different satellites altogether .",
    "an added difficulty arises in the extremely difficult task of detecting a weak secondary component at energies below @xmath37 kev where photoelectric absorption is strong .",
    "this should be kept in mind when assessing results form such combined analyses , some of which are discussed below .    even if nt emission is detected its origin",
    "has to be verified before it is identified with electrons in the halo .",
    "the first requirement is that the measured emission does not show any temporal variation ( that would usually imply agn origin )",
    ". sizes of radio halos in nearby clusters are in the range of @xmath38 , which in principle can be resolved by the _ ibis _",
    "instrument aboard _",
    "integral _ , the first imaging experiment in the high energy x - ray regime .",
    "clearly , higher detector sensitivity is required for resolved measurements of such large regions .",
    "all the other presently active ( and previous ) satellites with high energy spectral capability have fovs that are larger than the halos of ( even ) nearby clusters .",
    "measurements of nt emission have so far been solely spectral , thus providing only the necessary - but not sufficient - evidence for the detection of nt emission in a few clusters .",
    "systematic searches for nt x - ray emission began with the analysis of archival _",
    "_ measurements of six clusters ( coma , a  401 , a  2142 , a  2255 , a  2256 , a  2319 ) with measured radio halos @xcite , and continued with _",
    "observation of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "no significant nt emission was detected , resulting in lower limits on the mean , volume - averaged magnetic fields in these clusters , @xmath39 g ) .",
    "observation of the coma cluster with the _ cgro / osse _ experiment for @xmath40 ks was the first dedicated measurement of a cluster aimed at measuring nt emission .",
    "the fact that the predicted emission was not detected clearly established that instruments with higher detector sensitivity , significantly lower level of internal background , and much smaller fov ( than that of _ osse _ , @xmath41 fwhm ) , are the minimal requirements for measurement of emission in the @xmath42 kev band .    attempts to measure",
    "nt emission from clusters continued with all subsequent x - ray satellites whose nominal spectral band extended beyond 10 kev .",
    "first observational evidence for nt emission came from long measurements with the _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ satellites , as discussed in the next two subsections , followed by a review of results from _ asca _ , initial results from _ suzaku / hxd _ , and the first spatial analysis of _ integral / ibis _ observations of the coma cluster .",
    "the search for cluster nt emission advanced significantly through long observations with the pca and hexte experiments aboard the _ rxte _ satellite .",
    "these instruments have the minimally required capabilities for detection of a weak nt spectral component - sufficiently high sensitivity for precise measurement of the primary thermal emission , and good background subtraction achieved by ( on and off source ) ` rocking ' of the hexte detectors . the crucial _ rxte _ features which are essential for identifying the small nt component are spectral overlap of the two experiments over the effective ( narrower than nominal ) @xmath43 kev band , and the same triangular spatial response function with @xmath44 fwhm .",
    "as has been noted already , the _ rxte _ does not have the capability to resolve the emission even in nearby ( rich ) clusters , implying that the exact origin of nt emission can not be identified even when a secondary spectral component is clearly detected .",
    "we review here results of searches for nt components in the spectra of clusters that were observed for at least @xmath45 ks .",
    "shorter observations were mostly aimed at measurement of the primary thermal emission , with the exception of a @xmath46 ks observation of a  754 @xcite , and even shorter @xmath47 ks observations of a  2256 @xcite and a  1367 @xcite , which resulted in upper limits on nt emission in these clusters . for obvious reasons ,",
    "coma was the first cluster searched for nt emission with _ rxte _",
    "the search continued with long observations of a  2319 , a  2256 , and a  2163 , all with observed radio halos .",

    "the analysis was repeated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) by @xcite ; they concluded that the discrepant results are due to the presence of two variable sources in one of the background fields , which is why they ignored that field in their analysis .",
    "the different background fields and the use of the xas software ( rather than saxdas ) were suggested to be the reasons for the high significance ( @xmath140 ) detection reported by @xcite . in a recent reply to @xcite",
    ", @xcite defended their re - analysis and the lower detection significance of the hard excess , re - emphasising that the significance is highly sensitive to both the choice of the offset pointings for local background estimation , and also to the exact value of the temperature adopted in the analysis .",
    "@xcite analysed a sample of 868 blank fields and found no difference in flux values when using either of the two offset pointings .",

    "flux confusion due to unidentified ( and therefore unremoved ) background agn is particularly troublesome due to the relatively large fov ( @xmath134 ) of the pds .",
    "although some of the integrated emission of distant agn in the cluster field is removed in the rocking mode , there still is a residual signal due to agn background fluctuations , and possibly also the presence of agn in the cluster .",
    "this introduces a level of systematic uncertainty that was not specifically accounted for in most published pds cluster analyses .",
    "analysing 164 pds blank - sky observations , @xcite found a systematic difference in the background - subtracted fluxes when using only one of the two pointings available for the local background estimate in the standard rocking mode .",
    "the authors speculate that this might be due to either radiation entering the collimators from the side , screening of the instruments by the satellite , or the fact that the detector is looking at more / less radioactive parts of the satellite .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite , but are more pronounced by a factor of @xmath145 . the difference in flux values when using either of the two offset pointings seems to be the reason for the different results obtained for the significance of the detection of nt emission in coma .",
    "the issue remains unsettled and needs to be further explored .",
    "moreover , as we have pointed out , precise separation between the primary and secondary spectral components depends very much on the ability to do a simultaneous fit to the parameters of both thermal and possibly nt emission .",

    "a brief review of their results follows .",
    "the problematic aspects of a statistical study of pds data should first be summarised .",
    "as we have already noted , flux confusion due to unidentified agn is of particular concern due to the relatively large pds fov . @xcite used optical catalogues to identify seyfert 1 galaxies , and bepposax mecs or rosat pspc data at their locations to estimate the agn contribution in the pds spectra .",
    "clusters for which the estimated seyfert 1 contribution was more than 15  % of the total signal were removed from the initial sample .",
    "population synthesis modelling of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) indicates that 80  % of the agn need to be obscured to produce the cxb spectrum @xcite , which is harder than the spectrum of unobscured agn .",
    "indeed , recent deep x - ray observations of blank fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) have discovered a population of absorbed point sources that outnumbers the seyfert 1 galaxies by a factor of @xmath714 .",
    "these obscured agn are seen through an absorbing torus ( with @xmath181 atoms@xmath29 ; @xcite ) which hides them in the soft x - ray band . thus ,",
    "a robust estimate for their contribution was not available .",
    "however , the spectral and spatial distribution of the nt emission ( see below ) argues against significant contamination due to obscured agn in the final @xcite sample .",
    "the thermal emission of clusters in the sample was modelled by @xcite based on results of published analyses of the emission measured by the bepposax mecs and xmm - newton epic instruments .",
    "since the pds has no spatial resolution , the flux observed in the central region was extrapolated to the full pds fov using the appropriate single ( or double ) @xmath80 models , after account was made for vignetting .",
    "they extrapolated the thermal emission model to the @xmath48 kev band and compared the prediction with the pds data , thus estimating the nt emission .",
    "the comparison showed that in @xmath7150  % of the clusters the nt component was marginally detected at the 2@xmath135 level .",
    "most of the significant detections were found in clusters which show signs of recent merger activity .",
    "specifically , when clusters were divided into ` relaxed ' or ` merger ' groups , it was determined that the mean @xmath48 kev nt emission in the latter group ( @xmath182 countss@xmath13 ) was @xmath183 times higher than that of the ` relaxed ' clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the level of systematic uncertainties due to background fluctuations is such that only the emission from clusters in the ` merger ' group was found to be marginally significant ( at @xmath184 ) . assuming a power - law shape for this excess with ( photon ) index of 2.0",
    ", it was deduced that the @xmath48 kev luminosity per cluster is @xmath185 ergs@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the residual emission of the individual clusters was too weak for meaningful spectral analysis ; therefore , @xcite co - added the data for the clusters , which amounted to a total of 560 ks . in order to obtain an estimate for the thermal contribution , the authors fitted data in the @xmath186 kev band obtaining a best - fit temperature of @xmath98 kev , consistent with the sample median . extrapolating this model to",
    "the @xmath48 kev band showed that there was indeed excess emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "a fit of the full @xmath187 kev data to a thermal model resulted in a statistically unacceptable fit with an unrealistically high temperature of @xmath188 kev .",
    "a fit of the residual emission with a power - law model yielded a best - fit index @xmath189 at 90  % cl .",
    "since a typical agn index is @xmath190 , appreciable agn emission was ruled out at the 98  % cl .",
    "the high level of nt emission in the @xmath186 kev band ( @xmath191  % of the total ) is problematic , because in the central regions of the clusters in which nt emission was deduced , the mecs data typically allow the fractional contribution of such emission to be only a few percent .",
    "this seems to suggest that nt emission is extended with only a small fraction originating in the central region .    the indication from these statistical results for a connection between the cluster merger state and nt emission may be seen to support the scenario whereby electrons are accelerated by merger shocks .",
    "if so , the deduced power - law indices correspond to differential relativistic electron spectra with indices in the range @xmath192 .",
    "the implied radio synchrotron ( energy ) spectral indices @xmath193 , are consistent with the observed range .",
    "_ asca _ had a fairly good sensitivity and low background up to about 10 kev , clearly too low for observing cluster nt emission .",

    "asca_. the first reported detection of excess emission , at energies above 5 kev , was made for the group hcg  62 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the excess component was @xmath194 erg s@xmath13 , which was estimated to be some 20 times higher than the contribution of discrete x - ray sources .",
    "the hard excess was spatially extended to about @xmath195 from the centre .",
    "since the spectrum was too hard to be interpreted as thermal emission from the intra - group gas , a nt origin was thought to be more likely .",
    "a recent analysis of _ suzaku _ xis and hxd ( see below ) measurements of hcg  62 resulted only in an upper limit on nt emission @xcite , but at a level which does not exclude the asca result .    @xcite carried out",
    "a search for nt emission from 18 groups of galaxies observed with _ asca _ , including hcg  62 .",
    "they fitted the spectra below 2.5 kev with 2 temperature thermal ( mekal ) models and compared the data in the @xmath196 kev band with the extrapolated thermal spectra .",
    "excess fluxes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] in terms of statistical significance .",
    "hcg 62 and rgh 80 show excess emission at @xmath197 cl , with excess emission thought to be likely also in ngc  1399 .",
    "the residual spectra could be fitted either with a thermal model with @xmath198 kev or a power - law model with photon index fixed at 2 .",
    "the @xmath199 kev luminosity of the excess component is @xmath200  % of the thermal emission and @xmath201 times stronger than the contribution from discrete x - ray sources .",
    "they concluded that both thermal and nt origins are acceptable from a statistical point of view .",
    "suzaku , the 5th japanese x - ray satellite launched in july 2005 , carries hard x - ray detectors ( hxd ) along with the x - ray ccd instrument ( xis ) .",
    "the combined energy range is from 0.3 kev up to about 600 kev , and a wide - band coverage of x - ray and @xmath6-ray sources is possible .",
    "the hxd system consists of 16 units of well - type phoswich detectors , surrounded by anti - coincidence shield scintillators @xcite .",
    "the well - type detector consists of a long active collimator made of bgo ( a bismuth - germanium oxyde ) , and the bottom of the well is equipped with si pin detectors and a gso ( a gadolinium - silicon oxyde ) scintillator .",
    "the pin is 2 mm thick and sensitive from 8 kev to 50 kev ; the gso covers the @xmath202 kev band .",
    "typical effective areas are 160 @xmath203 at 10 kev ( pin ) , and 330 @xmath203 at 100 kev ( gso ) .",

    "the fov becomes wider , up to @xmath205 .",
    "the pin detectors are cooled to @xmath206c by a thermal radiator connected with heat pipes .",
    "the background level is very low for the pin detector , since it has no accumulated effect of radio - activation in orbit .",
    "the measured background level in orbit is indeed lower than the level of the pds ( on bepposax ) by a factor of about 3 , even though suzaku s inclined orbit makes it more susceptible to the intense x - rays during passage through the radiation belt .",
    "this and the hxd narrow fov make it the most sensitive instrument in the @xmath207 kev band , among all previously flown hard x - ray detectors .",
    "about 30 clusters have already been observed ( as of april 2007 ) with suzaku , including several for which the primary purpose is a search for nt emission .",
    "meaningful constraints on nt emission were obtained for rather low temperature clusters .",
    "most extensively observed is a  3376 ; these observations are described in some detail .",
    "this nearby ( @xmath208 ) merging cluster has an ic gas temperature of @xmath209 kev .",
    "the relatively low temperature motivated the selection of the cluster as the prime target for observations with the pin detectors .",
    "the cluster is noted by two large radio relics , probably expanding over a mpc scale in the east and west boundaries of the thermal emission .",
    "bepposax observations resulted in a @xmath210 detection of a nt component .",
    "the suzaku observations were carried out during two separate pointings in october and november 2005 .",
    "the first @xmath211 ks observation covered the central region which includes the east relic , and the second @xmath212 ks was centred on the west relic region .",
    "the background properties have been investigated by @xcite and applied to the a  3376 data .",
    "background data , i.e.  data taken when the satellite was pointing to the dark earth , were sorted by position of the satellite in earth coordinates .",
    "this basically performs sorting with the cosmic - ray cut - off rigidity which is known to correlate well with the non x - ray background .",
    "since passage through the radiation belt leaves enhanced emission afterward , the data in each earth position were further divided into northward and southward satellite movements .",
    "the long - term trend of the background variation was also included in the estimation .",
    "comparison with the predicted background rate and the observed dark earth data indicates that this method gives 3.5  % ( @xmath213 ) error .",
    "this method was applied to the observed data in the energy range @xmath214 kev .",
    "thermal cluster emission , estimated from the xis measurements , cxb and point source contributions need to be subtracted . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , the hxd pin spectrum for the west relic suggests some level of excess emission . including fluctuations of all these components , the flux of the west relic in the @xmath214 kev band is @xmath215 erg@xmath29s@xmath13 , where the errors are statistical and systematic , respectively .",
    "most of the systematic error , about 85  % , is non - cxb ; thus , further improvement in the background estimation is necessary in order to better determine the level of excess emission .",
    "the implied upper limit , @xmath216 erg@xmath29s@xmath13 , is consistent with the limit obtained from the _ rxte _ measurements , and about 20  % lower than the level reported from the _ bepposax _ observation .",
    "the west - relic region was jointly observed with the xis instrument , and kawano et al . also constrained the possible power - law flux based on the spectral fit .",
    "the obtained upper limit in the @xmath196 kev region is extrapolated to @xmath214 kev assuming a photon index of 1.8 with no scaling with the fov , and it corresponds to about 20  % of the hard x - ray upper limit .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that the true nt flux is less than @xmath217 erg@xmath29s@xmath13 in the @xmath214 kev band ; however , if the emission is spatially extended then the xis constraint still allows a hard flux of @xmath218 erg@xmath29s@xmath13 over the pin field of view .",

    "these clusters are both relaxed nearby systems with @xmath221 kev ; a  1060 is non - cd cluster , while the centaurus cluster is dominated by a cd galaxy .",
    "the clusters were well studied by @xcite .",
    "the observed data for the a  1060 and centaurus cluster by the pin instrument were accumulated for 28 and 26 ks , respectively .",
    "the latter authors applied the standard non - cxb subtraction and found that the blank - sky data yielded a fluctuation of @xmath222  % ( @xmath213 ) in the energy range @xmath223 kev . when the non - cxb flux was subtracted from the data , the data for both clusters showed agreement with the cxb above 20 kev ;",
    "the a  1060 data even showed a deficit of the counts . in the energy range",
    "@xmath224 kev , there remained an excess flux over the cxb level for both clusters .",
    "the flux was 4 or 8 times stronger than the cxb level for a  1060 and centaurus , respectively .",
    "the cluster thermal emission was measured with _ asca _ , which had a wider fov than the pin , and the measured temperatures were 3.3 and 3.8 kev for the two clusters .",
    "these spectra with the intensity consistent with the _ asca _ measurement were compared with the pin residual component .",
    "they found that the thermal emission can explain the pin data quite well for both clusters , so only upper limits were derived on the nt emission .",

    "@xcite reported the analysis of a @xmath227 ks observation of the coma cluster with ibis / isgri .",
    "the cluster was detected at a significance @xmath228 cl in the @xmath229 kev energy band .",

    "the detected flux in the @xmath229 kev band is consistent with the extrapolation of the flux measured by _ xmm - newton _ below 10 kev assuming a model of a thin thermal plasma model with @xmath232 kev ( see @xcite ) ; no statistically significant flux is seen in the higher energy band . from the observed images it appears that in order to detect or meaningfully constrain with _",

    "the relatively steep power - law shape of cluster nt emission ( which is most precisely measured in the radio ) directly implies that the detection of @xmath6-ray emission from even nearby clusters will be very challenging . to estimate the predicted level of emission , consider the coma cluster as an example ; assuming no change in the relativistic electron power - law index , and the deduced @xmath48 kev flux level ( in table [ hxr_xte.tab ] ) , the cumulative flux at @xmath234 mev is @xmath235 @xmath29s@xmath13 .",
    "although substantially uncertain , flux at this level is close to the projected _ glast _ sensitivity threshold for an exposure time of 1 yr for the all sky survey",
    ". the flux will be well below this level if the electron spectrum steepens even modestly at energies above the range deduced from radio measurements .",
    "note that @xmath6-ray emission could also have hadronic origin ( from @xmath236 decay , following proton - proton interactions ) , but only very rough limits can be placed on this emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a statistical upper limit on @xmath6-ray emission from clusters was obtained by @xcite from analysis of _ egret _ measurements .",
    "the emission in fields centred at 58 clusters observed between 1991 and 2000 was analysed . a co - added mean flux level was determined after accounting for the diffuse background contribution .",

    "interestingly , this level is at the level predicted for coma based on direct extrapolation of the deduced @xmath48 kev flux .",
    "this _ egret _",
    "upper limit was used by @xcite and @xcite to constrain models of hard x - ray emission components of leptonic origin ; similarly @xcite used it to constrain the energetic proton energy density in ic space .",
    "it has been known all along that definite detection of nt x - ray emission in clusters is a challenging task .",
    "this is due to several factors , major among which are its intrinsically weak level - swamped as it is by the intense primary thermal emission - and the difficult to achieve requisite high sensitivity and low detector background in the @xmath240 kev band .",
    "as has been emphasised , results of the search are not unequivocal , even for coma and a  2256 for which detection",
    "( by _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ ) was claimed to be at moderately high level of statistical significance .",
    "this is mainly due to source confusion and a complete lack of spatial information",
    ". the search should continue ( with _ suzaku _ and future satellites ) , spurred by its sound physical basis - the ubiquity of the cmb , and the observed radio synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "the expected level of nt emission of compton origin depends steeply on the mean magnetic field strength in the central cluster region . clearly , if this is typically a fraction of a @xmath17 g , as has been deduced in the analyses described in the previous section , then prospects for more definite detection of nt emission - perhaps already with deep _ suzaku _ measurements - are indeed good .",
    "however , significantly higher @xmath18 values - a few @xmath17 g - are deduced from fr measurements ; had these been meaningful estimates of the _ volume - averaged _ field strength , then definite detection of nt emission would have been seriously questioned .    as we have noted already",
    "( in sect .  2.2 ) , the apparent discrepancy between deduced values of @xmath22 and @xmath18 has been investigated at some length .",
    "these two field measures are quite different ; the former is essentially a volume average of the relativistic electron density and ( roughly ) the square of the field , the latter is an average along the line of sight of the product of the field and gas density .",
    "all these quantities vary considerably across the cluster ; in addition , the field is very likely tangled , with a wide range of coherence scales which can only be roughly estimated .",
    "these make the determination of the field by both methods considerably uncertain .",
    "thus , the unsatisfactory observational status ( stemming mainly from lack of spatial information ) and the intrinsic difference between @xmath22 and @xmath18 , do not allow a simple comparison of these quantities .",
    "even if the large observational and systematic uncertainties , the different spatial dependences of the fields , relativistic electron density , and thermal electron density , already imply that @xmath22 and @xmath18 will in general be quite different .",

    "they concluded that @xmath22 is indeed generally smaller than @xmath18 .",

    "<S> we briefly review the main results from observations of extended regions of radio emission , and faraday rotation measurements of background and cluster radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus of the review are searches for nonthermal x - ray emission conducted with past and currently operating satellites , which yielded appreciable evidence for nonthermal emission components in the spectra of a few clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this evidence is clearly not unequivocal , due to substantial observational and systematic uncertainties , in addition to virtually complete lack of spatial information . </S>",
    "<S> if indeed the emission has its origin in compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the cmb , then the mean magnetic field strength and density of relativistic electrons in the cluster can be directly determined . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of these basic nonthermal quantities is valuable for the detailed description of processes in intracluster gas and for the origin of magnetic fields . </S>"
