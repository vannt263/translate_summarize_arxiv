    "the non - equilibrium state of a dilute gas system is considered to be described by the one - particle distribution function ( 1pdf ) , and such an approach to the non - equilibrium system is called the ` kinetic theory '  @xcite . in the kinetic theory ,",
    "the 1pdf is treated as the independent dynamical variable of the system , and all the physical quantities are determined by the 1pdf .",
    "the kinetic equation is an equation of motion of the 1pdf , and the dynamics in the kinetic theory is described by this equation .",
    "a lot of works has been done on the derivation of the quantum kinetic equation ( qke ) in the framework of the green function technique . perhaps , the most popular approach is the generalized kadanoff - baym ( gkb ) formalism  @xcite which utilizes an ansatz for the non - equilibrium green function called the gkb ansatz .",
    "the gkb ansatz can be expressed by the usual equilibrium keldysh green function in which the equilibrium 1pdf is replaced by a non - equilibrium one .",
    "an alternative approach is the counter - term method based on the ctp formalism  @xcite , or on the thermo - field dynamics  @xcite . in this approach , a counter - term , in which the non - equilibrium properties are included ,",
    "is first introduced into the ctp or thermo - field lagrangian , and then the unperturbed propagator gets the similar structure as the gkb ansatz .",
    "although the qke can be derived in these approaches , the kinetic theory is not completely constructed because they do not give a proper method to express the expectation values of physical quantities in terms of the 1pdf .",
    "of course , the expectation value of a physical quantity of interest can be calculated perturbatively by the usage of the non - equilibrium propagators mentioned above , and it becomes a functional of the 1pdf .",
    "but if we want to obtain a functional of the 1pdf , the value of the 1pdf must be fixed from the exterior , and the integrations over the microscopic fields should be carried out under the restriction due to the fixing of the 1pdf .",
    "this restriction has not been considered in the above formalisms , and hence they do not give a complete basis for the kinetic theory .    in this paper , we present a systematic perturbative method to calculate the expectation value of any physical quantity as a functional of the wigner distribution function ( wdf ) , which plays the role of the 1pdf in quantum theory .",
    "our approach , is somewhat different from the gkb or the counter - term method .",
    "it is based on the inversion method  @xcite .",
    "an inversion - method approach to derive the qke was presented in refs .  , and the problem of calculating the physical quantities in terms of the wdf is partly solved there ; we first introduce an external source @xmath0 to probe the wdf @xmath1 , and calculate the physical quantity as a functional of the source @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "then we express the source as a functional of the wdf ( @xmath3 $ ] which is an inversion of @xmath4 $ ] ) , and by substituting it into the above calculated @xmath2 $ ] , we can write the quantity by the wdf . in this approach ,",
    "the propagator is a functional of the external source @xmath0 , and the perturbative calculation can be done without the restriction of fixing the wdf .",
    "the calculations in our formulation indeed generates different results from those obtained by the perturbative calculation using , e.g. , the gkb ansatz . by the substitution of the inverted relation , some contributions from the diagrams , which will be present in the calculations with other formalisms ,",
    "are canceled .",
    "we show that the contributions which are canceled can be expressed by a corresponding time - ordered diagrams : the contributions from a diagram in the non - equilibrium theory can be classified by the temporal order of the vertices in the diagram , and to each temporal ordering of the vertices , a time - ordered diagram ( called a configuration in the article ) corresponds .",
    "then if an obtained configuration can be separated into two parts by cutting two propagators at the same instant , the contribution from that configuration is canceled . because the propagator used in our method has the form of the gkb ansatz",
    ", this will also provide a basis for the kinetic theoretic description in the gkb formalism .    in the course of proving this property , we reformulate the inversion method approach in the framework of the legendre transformation  @xcite .",
    "the definition of non - equilibrium generating functional is slightly modified in a way characteristic to the non - equilibrium theory , and the effective action is defined as the legendre transformation of it .",
    "then the diagrammatic rule for the effective action discussed in ref .   can be utilized with an extension to the non - equilibrium case . by virtue of this",
    ", the qke can also be expressed in a compact form which is finally given as ( [ qke ] ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the inversion method approach to the qke , and reformulate it in the terminology of legendre transformation .",
    "then in [ diagrammer ] , the diagrammatic rule for the kinetic theory is discussed : the rule to calculate the expectation value as a functional of the wdf is presented in [ q - rule ] , and the rule to derive the qke is in [ qke - rule ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the inversion method approach to the qke  @xcite .",
    "the system to be considered is the same as in ref .  ; a non - relativistic bosonic field described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 with @xmath6 and a spatially inhomogeneous initial density matrix @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the case that the interaction @xmath8 can be treated perturbatively , and for simplicity , the initial correlation is not taken into account .",
    "see ref .   for the treatment of the initial correlation .    in quantum statistical physics",
    ", the natural alternative of the 1pdf will be the wigner distribution function ( wdf ) defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the angular bracket implies the average over initial density matrix @xmath7 ; @xmath11 .",
    "as in ref .  , for the sake of perturbative calculation , it is more convenient to work with the fourier transform of the wdf defined as @xmath12 to which we refer simply as the wdf in the following . note that @xmath13 holds due to the hermitian property of @xmath7 .    within the ctp formalism , eq .",

    ", this can be realized by first calculating perturbatively the expectation value @xmath36 with the use of the propagator @xmath37 $ ] in previous subsection , and then by substituting the source written by the wdf as in ( [ j2 ] ) into the obtained functional .",

    "such an expansion can be expressed diagrammatically by the usage of a propagator @xmath39 $ ] , and the above mentioned cancellation implies that some part of the diagram should be omitted if we want to evaluate the expectation value as a functional of the wdf .    from this observation",

    "<S> utilizing a non - equilibrium green function like the generalized kadanoff - baym ansatz , a systematic perturbative method is presented to calculate the expectation value of an arbitrary physical quantity under the restriction that the wigner distribution function is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , in the diagrammatic expression of the quantity , a certain part of contributions can be eliminated due to the restriction . together with the quantum kinetic equation , this method provides a basis for the kinetic - theoretical description . </S>"
