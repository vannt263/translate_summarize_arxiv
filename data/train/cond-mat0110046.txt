    "there has been growing interest on the non - extensive formalism based on tsallis entropy @xcite @xmath9 which is characterized by the index @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath11",
    ", @xmath12 reduces to boltzmann entropy . in order to deeply understand what the non - extensive formalism means , the mixing properties of one dimensional ( 1d ) dissipative maps @xcite have been studied based on @xmath12 .",
    "it is shown that there exists the special value @xmath0 of entropic index of @xmath2 such that @xmath1 is finite for @xmath6 , and vanishes ( diverges ) for @xmath13 .",
    "we here focus on the existence of such a unique value of @xmath0 since it may shed some light on the meaning of @xmath10 in the non - extensive formalism .",
    "_ @xcite have found that @xmath2 linearly grows when the entropic index @xmath10 equals @xmath14 for standard logistic map at the feigenbaum critical point .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the @xmath0 can be obtained from three different methods : i ) the upper - bound of a sensitivity of initial conditions @xmath15 ; ii ) the singularity strength of a multi - fractal distribution @xmath16 ; iii ) tsallis entropy becomes linear in time @xmath17 .",
    "in addition all three methods yield the same value of @xmath14 for standard logistic map .",
    "we have proposed an alternative method @xcite of obtaining @xmath0 as follows : the conditional non - extensive entropy which is introduced by abe and rajagopal @xcite , @xmath18 becomes _ additive _ if and only if @xmath10 equals @xmath0 .",
    "we here explain the underlying simple mechanism in our method of obtaining @xmath0 . then the works of latora _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and de moura _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are explained in terms of our method .",
    "the connection between the rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 is also discussed .",
    "let us begin with explaining the essence of our method @xcite of obtaining @xmath0 .",
    "suppose the number of states @xmath19 obeys a power - law evolution expressed with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}$ ] and @xmath23 .",
    "then the corresponding conditional tsallis entropy eq .",
    "( [ cond - ent ] ) can be written as @xmath24              = \\ln_q[\\ ; \\exp_{q^*}(k'_{q^ * } \\ ; t ) \\;],\\ ] ] where the relation @xmath25 = ( \\ln_q y - \\ln_q x)/x^{1-q}$ ] is used . from the last expression , we see that @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 , consequently @xmath29 becomes additive , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "we now explain the work of latora _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in the view of our method . in their work the whole phase space ( @xmath31 ) was divided into a large number @xmath32 of equal cells and the time evolution of @xmath2 for standard logistic map was calculated .",
    "the key points of their procedure are : i ) their initial distribution is that all @xmath33 points are in a single cell @xmath34 at @xmath35 , consequently @xmath36 ; and ii ) averaging @xmath2 over the best initial cells @xmath37 .",
    "note that since @xmath38 , the conditional tsallis entropy @xmath26 reduces to @xmath2 .",
    "this seems trivial at glance .",
    "however the essential point is the averaging over the best initial ensemble in ii ) .",
    "our opinion is that what is calculated in their procedures is nothing but the conditional tsallis entropy , which is originally defined @xcite by @xmath39 in other words , @xmath40 is the @xmath10-average of the conditional entropy @xmath41 over the initial cells @xmath37 .",
    "in fact the @xmath42considered in their paper is a probability of finding a point in the @xmath43-th cell @xmath44 at time @xmath45 for the initial condition that the only @xmath34 is occupied at @xmath35 .",
    "hence the @xmath46 is nothing but the conditional probabilities @xmath47 ! then introducing @xmath41 as @xmath48 we can readily show the quantity @xmath2 in their paper is nothing but @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ cond - sq ] ) .",
    "in addition , let @xmath50 be the total number of the best initial cells @xmath51 for the averaging , then @xmath52 .",
    "( [ cond - sq ] ) is rewritten by @xmath53 which is the conventional average of the conditional tsallis entropy of @xmath41 over the best initial cells @xmath51 .",
    "we next focus on the work of de moura _ et al .",
    "they have studied the rate of the convergence to the critical attractor of the generalized logistic map .",
    "their initial ensemble consists of @xmath33 points that uniformly spread over the entire phase space .",
    "they assume that @xmath54 evolves at a constant rate @xmath7 , and consequently the number of occupied cells @xmath19 evolves in time as @xmath55^{\\frac{1}{1-q^*}}.\\ ] ] this can be rewritten as @xmath56          = w(0 ) \\cdot \\exp_{q^ * } [ k'_{q^ * } t ] ,    \\label{w}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "note that the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath7 is the same relation @xmath59 between the langrage multiplier @xmath60 of the optimal lagrange multiplier ( olm ) method @xcite and that @xmath61 of tsallis - mendes - plastino in canonical ensemble formalism . since the conditional tsallis entropy @xmath40 is expressed as @xmath62 $ ] , eq .",
