    "quantum tunneling , where a particle has finite probability to penetrate a classically forbidden region is an important feature of wave mechanics .",
    "invention of the tunnel diode @xcite , the scanning tunneling microscope @xcite etc . make it useful from a technological point of view . in 1932 maccoll @xcite pointed out that tunneling is not only characterized by a tunneling probability but also by a time the tunneling particle takes to traverse the barrier .",
    "there is considerable interest on the question of time spent by a particle in a given region of space @xcite .",
    "the recent development of nanotechnology brought new urgency to study the tunneling time as it is directly related to the maximum attainable speed of nanoscale electronic devices . in a number of numerical @xcite , experimental @xcite and analytical study of quantum tunneling processes , various definitions of tunneling times",
    "have been investigated .",
    "these different time scales are based on various different operational definitions and physical interpretations . till date there is no clear consensus about the existence of a simple expression for this time as there is no hermitian operator associated with it @xcite . among the various time scales , ` dwell time ' @xcite which gives the duration of a particle s stay in the barrier region regardless of how it escapes can be calculated as the total probability of the particle inside the barrier divided by the incident probability current .",
    "bttiker and landauer proposed @xcite that one should study ` tunneling time ' using the transmission coefficient through a static barrier of interest , supplemented by a small oscillatory perturbation .",
    "a large number of researchers interpret the phase delay time @xcite as the temporal delay of a transmitted wave packet .",
    "this time is usually taken as the difference between the time at which the peak of the transmitted packet leaves the barrier and the time at which the peak of the incident gaussian wave packet arrives at the barrier . within the stationary phase approximation the phase time can be calculated from the energy derivative of the ` phase shift ' in the transmitted or reflected amplitudes .",
    "bttiker - landauer @xcite raised objection that the peak is not a reliable characteristic of packets distorted during the tunneling process .",
    "in contrast to ` dwell time ' which can be defined locally , the ` phase time ' is essentially asymptotic in character @xcite .",
    "the ` phase time ' statistics is intimately connected with dynamic admittance of micro - structures @xcite .",
    "this ` phase time ' is also directly related to the density of states @xcite .",
    "the universality of ` phase time ' distributions in random and chaotic systems has already been established earlier @xcite . in the case of ` not too opaque ' barriers ,",
    "the tunneling time evaluated either as a simple ` phase time ' @xcite or calculated through the analysis of the wave packet behaviour @xcite becomes independent of the barrier width .",
    "this phenomenon is termed as the hartman effect @xcite .",
    "this implies that for sufficiently large barriers the effective velocity of the particle can become arbitrarily large , even larger than the light speed in the vacuum ( superluminal effect ) .",
    "though this interpretation is a little far fetched for non - relativistic schrdinger equation as velocity of light plays no role in it , this effect has been established even in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "though experiments with electrons for verifying this prediction are yet to be done , the formal identity between the schrdinger equation and the helmholtz equation for electromagnetic wave enables one to correlate the results for electromagnetic and microwaves to that for electrons .",
    "photonic experiments show that electromagnetic pulses travel with group velocities in excess of the speed of light in vacuum as they tunnel through a constriction in a waveguide  @xcite .",
    "experiments with photonic band - gap structures clearly demonstrate that ` tunneling photons ' indeed travel with superluminal group velocities  @xcite .",
    "their measured tunneling time is practically obtained by comparing the two peaks of the incident and transmitted wave packets . thus all these experiments directly or indirectly confirmed the occurrence of hartman effect without violating ` einstein causality ' _",
    "i.e. _ , the signal velocity or the information transfer velocity is always bounded by the velocity of light .",
    "this tunneling time could be interpreted as the ` time of passage ' of the peak .",
    "since the velocity of the ` peak ' may exceed arbitrarily large numbers , this ` fast tunneling ' has been frequently related to ` superluminal propagation ' @xcite .",
    "the ` hartman effect ' has been extensively studied both for nonrelativistic ( schrdinger equation ) and relativistic ( dirac equation ) @xcite cases .",
    "recently winful @xcite showed that the saturation of phase time is a direct consequence of saturation of integrated probability density under the barrier . due to",
    "this saturation addition of a new particle in the incident side leads to an almost immediate release of another particle from the other side and these two particles are causally unrelated ; _ i.e. _ even the superluminal tunneling does not violate causality .",
    "equivalently , for electromagnetic waves the origin of the hartman effect has been traced to stored energy . since the stored energy in the evanescent field decreases exponentially within the barrier after a certain decay distances it becomes independent of the width of the barrier .",
    "the hartman effect has been found in one dimensional barrier tunneling @xcite as well as for cases beyond one dimension as in tunneling through mesoscopic rings in presence of aharonov - bohm flux @xcite . in the current note",
    "we extend the study of phase times for branched networks of quantum wires .",
    "such networks can readily be realized in optical wave propagation experiments .    in section-[description ] we give the description of typical quantum network systems under consideration .",
    "the theoretical framework used to analyze these systems is provided in section-[theory ] .",
    "all the main results showing hartman effect and the effects of quantum non - locality are discussed in section-[result ] .",
    "finally we summarize the results and draw conclusions in section-[conclusion ] .",
    "as a model system , we choose a network of thin wires .",
    "the width of these wires are so narrow that only the motion along the length of the wires is of interest ( a single channel case ) .",
    "the motion in the perpendicular direction is frozen in the lowest transverse subband . in a three - port y - branch circuit ( fig .  [ system ] )",
    "two side branches of quantum wire @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected to a ` base ' arm @xmath2 at the junction @xmath3 . in general",
    "one can have @xmath4 such side branches connected to a ` base ' wire .",
    "we study the scattering problem across a network geometry as presented schematically in fig .",
    "[ system ] .",
    ".5 cm    such geometries are important from the point of view of basic science due to their properties of tunneling and interference  @xcite as well as in applications such as wiring in nano - structures . in particular , the y - junction carbon nanotubes are in extensive studies and they show various interesting properties like asymmetric current voltage characteristics  @xcite . in our system of interest",
    "there are finite quantum mechanical potential barriers of strength @xmath5 and width @xmath6 in the @xmath7-th side branch .",
    "the number of side branches can vary from @xmath8 .",
    "we focus on a situation wherein the incident electrons have an energy @xmath9 less than @xmath5 for all @xmath7 .",
    "the impinging electrons in this subbarrier regime travels as an evanescent mode / wave and the transmission involve contributions from quantum tunneling and multiple reflections between each pair of barriers and the junction point .",
    "here we are interested in a single channel case where the fermi energy lie in the lowest subband . to excite the evanescent modes in the side branches one has to produce constrictions by making the width of the regions of wires containing barriers much thinner than that of other parts of the wires .",
    "the electrons occupying the lowest subband in the connecting wire on entering the constrictions experience a potential barrier ( due to higher quantum zero point energy ) and propagate as an evanescent mode @xcite . in this work",
    "an analysis of the phase time or the group delay time in such a system is carried out .",
    "we approach this scattering problem using the quantum wave guide theory  @xcite . in the stationary case the incoming particles",
    "are represented by a plane wave @xmath10 of unit amplitude .",
    "the effective mass of the propagating particle is @xmath11 and the energy is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave vector corresponding to the free particle .",
    "the wave functions , which are solutions of the schrdinger equation , in different regions of the system considered ( fig .  [ system ] ) can be written as ,    @xmath14    with @xmath15 being the imaginary wave vector in presence of rectangular barrier of strength @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 denote wave functions in three regions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , on @xmath7-th side branch . @xmath20 is the spatial coordinate for the ` base ' wire , whereas @xmath21 is spatial coordinate for the @xmath7-th arm .",
    "all these coordinates are measured from the junction @xmath3 . in @xmath7-th side branch ,",
    "the barrier starts at a distance @xmath22 from the junction @xmath3 .",
    "we use griffith s boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the junction @xmath3 .",
    "all the derivatives are taken either outward or inward from the junction  @xcite . in each side branch , at the starting and end points of the barrier , the boundary conditions can be written as @xmath25    from the above mentioned boundary conditions one can obtain the complex transmission amplitudes @xmath26 on each of the side branches .",
    "once @xmath26 is known , the ` phase time ' ( phase time for transmission ) can be calculated from the energy derivative of the phase of the transmission amplitude @xcite as @xmath27}{\\partial e}\\ , ,   \\label{phtm}\\ ] ] where , @xmath28 is the velocity of the free particle .",

    "we now proceed to analyze the behavior of @xmath39 as a function of various physical parameters for different network topologies .",
    "we measure time at the far end of each barrier in the branched arms containing barriers and in the case of arms in absence of any barrier we measure the phase time at the junction points .",
    "we express all the physical quantities in dimensionless units _",
    "i.e. _ all the barrier strengths @xmath5 in units of incident energy @xmath9 ( @xmath40 ) , all the barrier widths @xmath6 in units of inverse wave vector @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 and all the extrapolated phase time @xmath39 in units of inverse of incident energy @xmath9 ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "[ 1barrier](b ) shows the phase time @xmath30 in arm @xmath1 which does not contain any barrier .",
    "this also evolves and saturates with @xmath31 , the length of the barrier in the other arm @xmath0 .",
    "this delay is due to the contribution from paths which undergo multiple reflection in the first branch before entering the second branch via junction point @xmath3 . in absence of a barrier in the @xmath7-th arm",
    "the phase time @xmath39 measured close to the junction @xmath3 should go to zero _ i.e. _ @xmath48 in the absence of multiple scatterings in the first arm .",
    "note that @xmath47 and @xmath49 change with energies of the incident particle ( fig .",
    "[ 1barrier ] ) . from fig.[1barrier ] it can be easily seen that @xmath49 is always smaller than @xmath47 for any particular @xmath45 _",
    "i.e. _ the saturation time in the arm having no barrier is smaller .",
    "the phase time in both the arms show non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath45 . as we decrease the strength of the barrier @xmath45 the value of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) decreases in the whole range of widths of the barrier and also the saturated value of @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) decreases until @xmath45 reaches @xmath50 and with further decrease in @xmath45 the values of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) as well as @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) starts increasing .     and @xmath1 ,",
    "the ` phase times ' @xmath29 is plotted as a function of barrier width ` @xmath31 ' keeping @xmath51 and @xmath52 fixed and for different values of parameter @xmath53 .",

    "[ system ] .",
    "we fix the values of @xmath52 and vary @xmath31 for each values of @xmath53 to study the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath29 ( fig.[nonlocal - hartman ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ nonlocal - hartman ] we see that @xmath29 decreases with increase in @xmath31 to saturate to a value @xmath47 at each value of @xmath53 thereby showing ` hartman effect ' for arm ` @xmath0 ' .",

    "@xmath59 we see from fig .  [ 2bar - negative ] that @xmath29 is negative for almost the whole range of @xmath31-values showing ` time - advancement ' and eventually after a sharp decrease saturates to a negative value of @xmath68 implying ` hartman effect ' with advanced time .",
    "it might be noted that , in principle , the ` time - advancement ' ( fig .",
    "[ 2bar - negative ] ) can be measured experimentally as @xmath58 has a non - zero finite value for a small range of @xmath31 at lower @xmath31 regime where @xmath29 is negative . in the inset",

    "further the inset in fig .",
    "[ 2bar - negative ] shows a dip in @xmath30 at parameter regimes where @xmath64 has a minimum . for a wave packet with large spread in real space",
    "it is possible that the leading edge of the wave packet reaches the barrier much earlier than the peak of the packet .",
    "this leading edge in turn can tunnel through to produce a peak in the other end of the barrier much before the incident wave packet reaches the barrier region , sometimes referred to as pulse reshaping effect .",
    "this , in general , causes ` time advancement ' @xcite .",
    "this negative delay does not violate causality , however , the time is bounded from the below . in the presence of square wells in one dimensional systems negative time delays have been observed .",
    "this effect is termed as ` ultra hartman effect ' [ see for details @xcite ] .",
    "number of side branches each with a barrier of strength @xmath69 and width @xmath70 are connected with the incident arm @xmath2 . in each arm barriers",
    "start at the same point @xmath71 .",
    "thus all the side branches being identical the ` phase time ' for transmission through these arms @xmath72 saturate to the same value @xmath73 .",

    "[ system ] , but in presence of @xmath77 identical side branches and study phase time as a function of increasing @xmath74 .",
    "all the side branches being identical the ` phase times ' for transmission through each of these arms @xmath72 saturate to the same value @xmath73 for very large @xmath6 . in fig.[taus - n ]",
    "we plot the saturation value @xmath73 as a function of the total number of side branches @xmath74 present in the system . from the figure",
    "we see that for @xmath78 , @xmath73 first increases with @xmath74 to a maximum value of @xmath79 at @xmath80 and thereafter keeps on decreasing with the increase of @xmath74 . as we start reducing the strength of the barriers from @xmath81 we see that for @xmath82 the increasing nature of @xmath73 in small @xmath74 range vanishes .",
    "in general , at larger @xmath74 , the decreasing nature of @xmath73 with @xmath74 persists , _",
    "e.g. _ , note the solid curve in fig.[taus - n ] plotted at @xmath83 , but the initial increase in @xmath73 is not a generic feature . for larger @xmath74 transmission amplitude in each side branch reduces with increase in @xmath74 and hence the corresponding peaks of wave packets reach the far end at earlier times thereby reducing @xmath73 .",
    "we have studied hartman effect and non - locality in quantum network consisting of a main one dimensional arm having @xmath77 side branches . these side branches may or may not have barriers . in presence of barrier the ` phase time ' for transmission through a side branch shows the ` hartman effect ' . in general , as the number of side branches @xmath74 increases , the saturated ` phase time ' decreases .",
    "due to quantum nonlocality the ` phase time ' and it s saturated value at any side branch feels the presence of barriers in other branches . thus one can tune the saturation value of ` phase time ' and consequently the superluminal speed in one branch by changing barrier strength or width in any other branch , spatially separated from the former . moreover hartman effect with negative saturation times ( time advancement ) has been observed for some cases . in conclusion generalization of hartman effect in branched networks",
    "exhibits several counter - intuitive results due to quantum non - locality .",
    "system parameters such as number of side branches @xmath74 and barrier widths @xmath6 , strengths @xmath5 , distance @xmath22 ( from @xmath3 ) and incident energy @xmath9 etc .",
    "play very sensitive roles in determining delay times .",
    "the delay times are also sensitive to the junction @xmath84-matrix elements used for a given problem . in our present problem junction",
    "@xmath84-matrix is determined uniquely by the wave guide transport methods .",
    "depending on @xmath22 there may be one or several bound states located between the barriers in different branched arms and as a consequence saturated delay time can be varied from the negative ( ultra hartman effect ) to positive and vice - versa .",
    "we have verified this by looking at the transmission coefficient in the second arm @xmath1 which exhibits clear resonances as a function of @xmath85 . around these resonances , saturated delay time in the first arm",
    "@xmath47 changes the sign [ the details of which will be published elsewhere @xcite ] .",
    "moreover the reported effects are amenable to experimental verifications in the electromagnetic wave - guide networks .",
