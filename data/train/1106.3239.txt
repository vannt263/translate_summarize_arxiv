    "the physics of nonequilibrium systems in general involves dissipation and energy injection .",

    "a glass transition was located below random close packing which is qualitatively similar , but quantitatively different from the corresponding transition for a molecular fluid .",
    "the coherent scattering function was shown to display a plateau  provided the density is sufficiently close to the glass transition .",
    "the timescale for relaxation from the plateau ( @xmath0-relaxation ) diverges at the glass transition .",
    "the transition density as well as the dynamics depend on the degree of inelasticity , parametrized by the coefficient of restitution .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the dynamics of a driven two - dimensional granular fluid close to the glass transition , mimicking an air - table experiment .",
    "we use event driven simulations to compute the mean square displacement , the velocity autocorrelation , and the incoherent scattering function .",
    "dense systems of monodisperse , elastic hard disks are known to undergo a phase transition to a crystalline state @xcite .",
