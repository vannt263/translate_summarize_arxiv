    "atomically thin two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductors offer new opportunities for quantum spintronics and spin based quantum information processing .",
    "an electrically controllable spin qubit system based on 2d materials was first proposed in graphene , a gapless semiconductor .",
    "@xcite monolayer group - vib transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have recently emerged as a new class of direct gap 2d semiconductors with appealing optical properties and rich spin physics , implying their great potentials for hosting optically controlled spin qubits .",
    "@xcite these compounds are of the chemical composition of mx@xmath0 ( m = mo , w ; x = s , se ) .",
    "the monolayer is a x - m - x covalently bonded hexagonal 2d lattice , with a direct bandgap in the visible frequency range which is ideal for optoelectronic applications and for the exploration of optical control of spin .",
    "@xcite single electrons can be confined in quantum dots defined by lateral confinement potentials on an extended monolayer , e.g. by patterned electrodes , similarly to the quantum dots in iii - v heterostructures , and electrically controlled spin qubit has been proposed .",
    "@xcite alternatively , quantum dot confinement can also be realized by the lateral heterojunctions on a single crystalline monolayer , but with different metal elements in and outside the quantum dot region ( c.f .",
    "1 ) , where the band offset between the different tmd compounds forms the potential to confine single electron or hole .",
    "lateral heterostructures with mose@xmath0 islands surrounded by wse@xmath0 on a crystalline monolayer have been demonstrated very recently using chemical vapor deposition growth , although the length scale of the island is @xmath1 m , still too large for confining single electron .",
    "@xcite the tmds monolayers also host various atomic defects which can localize single electron or hole as well .",
    "@xcite remarkably , recent experiments have shown that certain types of defects in monolayer wse@xmath0 are excellent single photon sources , emitting at an energy which is a few tens mev below the exciton in the 2d bulk .",
    "@xcite such behaviors of the tmds defects resemble the shallow impurities in conventional semiconductors ( e.g. si donor in iii - v compounds ) that localize single electron ( or hole ) as well as single exciton , implying the possibility towards optical control of single electron spin .",
    "@xcite    optically controlled spin qubit is highly appealing in monolayer tmds because of the interesting optical properties of the 2d bulk .",
    "the monolayer tmds have a unique band structure with the conduction and valence band edges both at the degenerate k and -k valleys at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the direct - gap optical transitions have a selection rule : left- ( right- ) handed circular polarized photon couples to the interband transitions in the k ( -k ) valley only .",
    "@xcite this valley dependent optical selection rule has made possible in the 2d bulk the optical pumping of valley polarization , @xcite and optical generation of valley coherence .",
    "@xcite moreover , the spin - orbit coupling from the metal atoms gives rise to a pronounced coupling between the valley pseudospin and spin , @xcite through which the optical selection rule becomes a spin dependent one , allowing the optical control of spin as well .",
    "this suggests that the valley pseudospin and spin of a single electron can be a promising qubit carrier with optical controllabilities , as long as these bulk properties can be inherited when the electron is localized in the monolayers .",
    "a major difference in the spin and valley pseudospin physics expected between the bulk electron and the localized electron is the intervalley coupling and valley hybridization by the confinement .",
    "this issue has been studied for quantum dot confinement potentials on extended monolayers , @xcite where the intervalley coupling is found to be weak for quantum dot with lateral size larger than 20 nm ( @xmath2 mev or orders smaller , depending on the shape and size of the dot ) .",
    "in such a case , the valley hybridization is well quenched by the much stronger spin - valley coupling , and the quantum dot can well inherit the valley and spin physics of the 2d bulk .",
    "interestingly , a sensitive dependence of intervalley coupling strength on the central position of the confinement potentials is discovered .",
    "it is found that when the potential has c@xmath3 or higher rotational symmetry , the intervalley coupling completely vanishes if the potential center is at a chalcogen atom site or the hollow center of the hexagon formed by metal and chalcogen atoms , which is due to the dependence of the eigenvalue of c@xmath3 rotation operator on the location of the rotation center .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we investigate the optical control possibilities of spin - valley qubit carried by single electrons localized in nanostructures of monolayer tmds , including charged impurities and small quantum dots ( with length scale of 10 nm or smaller ) .",
    "we discuss the quantum controls under two different scenarios : ( i ) in the presence of valley hybridization due to the strong confinement and ( ii ) in the absence of valley hybridization .",
    "the latter scenario is considered for the confinements that has c@xmath3 or higher rotational symmetry about a chalcogen atom site or the hollow center of the hexagon formed by metal and chalcogen atoms , or when this symmetry is only weakly broken so that the residue intervalley coupling can be well quenched by the spin - valley coupling .",
    "we show that the bulk valley and spin optical selection rules can be inherited in different forms in the two scenarios , both of which allow the coherent rotation between electron states controlled by optical pulses . the hyperfine interaction between lattice nuclear spins and the electron or hole spin",
    "is also formulated within the envelop function approximation , and the nuclear spin induced decoherence of the spin - valley qubit is analyzed .",
    "we find that the short - range nature of the hyperfine interaction gives rise to intervalley terms , which can be utilized for optical control of the electron - nuclear spin entanglement .",

    "if the length scale of the confinement potential is still much larger than the lattice constants , the bound states are formed predominantly from the band - edge bloch states in the k and -k valleys of the 2d bulk . in general ,",
    "each eigenstate in the confinement is a hybridization of bloch states from the k and -k valleys due to the intervalley coupling introduced by the confinement potential , except when the potential has a @xmath4 rotational symmetry about either a chalcogen atom site or a hollow center of the hexagon formed by metal and chalcogen atoms.@xcite in the absence of valley hybridization , the bound - state eigenfunctions can be constructed from bloch states from the k or -k valley only , denoted as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the valley index for the @xmath7k valley , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denotes spin up ( down ) state .",
    "this is a convenient basis for our discussion , even when intervalley coupling and valley hybridization are present .",
    "intervalley coupling is then the off - diagonal matrix elements between these basis states due to the confinement potential .",
    "if confinement potential is spin - independent , intervalley coupling vanishes between states with opposite spin index . with the large quantization energy in the confinement potential ( see appendix [ intervalleycoupling ] ) , we can focus only on the ground states for each spin and valley index , while the excited states are far off resonance concerning either the valley hybridization effect or the optical control of the spin - valley qubit .",

    "the first is the lateral heterostructures between different tmds , for example , a mose@xmath0 island surrounded by wse@xmath0 on a crystalline monolayer . with a type - ii band alignment between the two tmds ,",
    "such a heterostructure forms a confinement potential of a vertical wall , which localizes a single electron in the mose@xmath0 region with a potential depth of few hundred mev .",
    "the valley and spin degrees of this electron can then define a qubit . in the optical control",
    ", an optical field can couple the states of the single electron to the optical excited states of trion ( i.e. two electrons plus a hole ) through the interband transition .",
    "these trion states are utilized as intermediate states for the optical control of the single electron states . although the heterostructure itself does not form a confinement for a single hole ( c.f .",
    "[ trion ] ) , the quantum confinement of the electron constituents will nevertheless localize the trion at the heterostructure .",
    "the intervalley coupling strength grows with the decrease in size of the quantum dot . at a lateral size of 5 nm ,",
    "the coupling matrix element reaches @xmath10 mev depending on the quantum dot shape .",
    "the valley hybridization will then be determined by the competition of this off - diagonal matrix elements in the basis @xmath5 , and the diagonal energy differences between @xmath11 and @xmath12 due to the spin - valley coupling in the band of the 2d bulk . for monolayer mos@xmath0 ,",
    "the spin - valley coupling strength in the conduction band is 3 mev , @xcite comparable to the achievable intervalley coupling in small quantum dots . for other three tmds ( mose@xmath0 , mos@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 ) , the spin - valley coupling strength is in the range of 20 - 40 mev .",
    "valley hybridization for the hole component is always negligible due to the giant spin - valley coupling of hundred of mev in all tmds .",
    "the second type of nanostructure is a neutral donor system @xmath13 , for example a re replacing a w in the wse@xmath0 monolayer , where the positively charged impurity binds the extra electron and forms a hydrogenic state .",
