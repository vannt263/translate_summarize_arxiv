    "exclusive b meson decays , especially @xmath14 modes , have aroused more and more interest for both theorists and experimenters .",
    "since it offers an attractive opportunity to get a deep insight into the flavor structure of the standard model ( sm ) and the cp violation parameters . but things are not so easy due to the non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "several approaches , which include factorization approach ( fa ) @xcite , qcd improved factorizations ( qcdf ) @xcite , soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite approach , have been developed to solve this problem .",
    "pqcd is based on @xmath15 factorization theorem @xcite while others are most based on collinear factorization @xcite . besides , sudakov factor and threshold resummation @xcite",
    "have been induced in pqcd to regulate the end - point singularities , so the arbitrary cutoffs @xcite are no longer necessary .    in the pqcd framework the hard amplitudes for various topologies of diagrams , including factorizable , nonfactorizable and annihilation , are all six - quark amplitudes , while in fa and qcdf the leading factorizable diagrams involve four - quark amplitudes .",
    "this difference leads to a different characteristic scale , the former @xmath16 @xcite and the latter @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we get a larger wilson coefficients ( @xmath18 ) associated with the qcd penguin in pqcd due to the evaluation of the renormalization group , this means penguin diagrams have been enhanced dynamically .",
    "current penguin dominated modes data , such as @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite , seem to fit well with the pqcd predictions @xcite .",
    "the recent @xmath21 data @xcite reveal a large transverse polarization fraction , which differs from most theoretical predictions and is considered as a puzzle .",
    "this indicates @xmath22 modes must be more complicated than we think and needs to be investigated more thoroughly .",
    "motivated by this , we study another @xmath23 mode within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "@xmath24 decays , which governed by @xmath25 form factors too , may help us to know more about the polarization puzzle , as well as the ckm phase angle @xmath26 @xcite and new physics . in the following sections , we will perform @xmath0 decays , which have the same topologies with @xmath27 @xcite , within the pqcd framework .",
    "our goal is to find out the branching ratios , cp asymmetries , as well as the polarization fractions .",
    "in the @xmath0 modes , the b meson is heavy and sitting at rest .",
    "it decays to two light vector mesons with large momenta .",
    "therefore the @xmath28 mesons are moving very fast in the rest frame of b meson . in this case",
    ", the short distance hard process dominates the decay amplitude and final state interaction ( fsi ) may not be important in most of the cases , this makes the perturbative qcd applicable . for @xmath6 decay ,",
    "because of its small branching ratio , fsi may occur through intermediate states @xmath29 or @xmath30 , etc . if future experiments deviate theoretical prediction largely",
    ", it might be an indication of strong fsi effects .",
    "here we give only the perturbative picture for experiments to test .    in pqcd approach ,",
    "the decay amplitude is factorized into the convolution of the mesons light - cone wave functions , the hard scattering kernel and the wilson coefficients , which stands for the soft , hard and harder dynamics respectively .",
    "the transverse momentum was introduced so that the endpoint singularity which will break the collinear factorization is regulated and the large double logarithm term appears after the integration on the transverse momentum , which is then resummed into the sudukov form factor .",
    "the formalism can be written as : @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum , which represents the transverse interval of the meson .",
    "@xmath33 is the largest energy scale in hard function @xmath34 , while the jet function @xmath35 comes from the summation of the double logarithms @xmath36 , called threshold resummation @xcite , which becomes large near the endpoint .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath37 given by @xcite @xmath38 -v_t\\sum_{i=3}^{10}c_i(\\mu)o_i^{(q)}(\\mu)\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ckm matrix elements @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the wilson coefficients , and the operators @xmath42 i and j stand for @xmath43 color indices .",
    "now let s analyze these decay channels topologically .",
    "first , it is categorized emission and annihilation diagrams .",
    "second , each category can be extracted to 4 diagrams , two factorizable and two nonfactorizable , in the leading order .",
    "let s take @xmath44 for instance , the spectator quark can be attached to each of the quark coming from the 4-quark operators with a hard gluon .    for the @xmath45 decays ( @xmath46 ) , only the operators @xmath47 contribute via penguin topology with light quark @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and via annihilation topology with the light quark @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) or @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is a pure penguin mode with only one kind of ckm element , as a result , it will not generate any difference between @xmath54 and @xmath55 decay and hence no direct cp violation . using the pqcd power counting rules @xcite",
    ", we can first predict that the main contribution came from the factorizable parts of the emission diagram @xmath56(f stands for factorizable , l stands for longitudinal , e stands for emission and @xmath57 stands for the operator involved ) with a large wilson coefficient @xmath58 . the operator @xmath59 disappear here because the vector meson @xmath60 can not be produced through a @xmath61 operator .",
    "but in @xmath62 decay @xcite , there is nt such constraint and the predicted branching ratio is about three times bigger than ours .",
    "second , the transverse parts of the emission diagram(@xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are down by a factor @xmath65 or @xmath66 , then the longitudinal parts(@xmath56 ) dominate this process and give a large longitudinal polarization fraction .",
    "third , nonfactorizable amplitudes @xmath67 , including both emission and annihilation diagrams , are suppressed by a power of @xmath68 when compared with factorizable ones . at last , we can forecast the factorizable parts of the annihilation diagrams ( @xmath69 ) counteract separately in most of the cases , to be exactly , @xmath70 and @xmath71 vanish and @xmath72 survive but suppressed by @xmath73 , this makes the emission diagram relatively more important .",
    "the factorizable parts for the space - like annihilation diagram ( @xmath74 ) with operator @xmath61 and wilson coefficient @xmath75 do not counteract in any case but is still not big enough to play the most important role .",
    "it is about 10 times smaller than the emission ones after calculation .",
    "= 4.0 in    things are different for the @xmath76 decays(@xmath77 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath47 contribute via penguin topology with the light quark @xmath78 ( @xmath49 ) and via the annihilation topology with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , while tree operator @xmath81 also contribute via annihilation topology ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we can see that there are two kinds of ckm elements , @xmath83 from tree and @xmath84 from penguin , that will induce weak phase and cp violation .",
    "we can get diagram 2.(a ) and 2.(b ) by replacing the d quark in @xmath46 ( a ) and ( b ) to u quark .",
    "it makes no difference for power counting and the conclusion we have given does nt change .",
    "diagram ( c ) is a tree diagram , we have a much bigger wilson coefficient @xmath85 for the factorizable parts and @xmath86 for the nonfactorizable parts , but at the same time , it is an annihilation diagram , as we have stated , @xmath87 and @xmath88 vanish and @xmath89 is suppressed by @xmath66 in this kind of diagram . after taken account of all these two aspects , we can foresee that this diagram will be big but not big enough to increase the branching ratio largely , we also believe the transverse parts will play a more important role than that of the former channel . our calculation is consistent with our predictions and will be shown in next section .",
    "= 5.0 in    we put the diagrams of @xmath6 decays in fig.3 . from the topology",
    "we know that @xmath47 contribute via annihilation topology with the light quark @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) or @xmath52 ( @xmath82 ) and tree operator @xmath81 contribute via annihilation topology ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "cpv occurs in this channels for the same reason we have given for @xmath90 .",
    "but when referring to the branching ratio , it is far different from the former two , cause it s a pure annihilation mode and the emission diagram which gives the main contribution to the branching ratio of the former two channels no longer exist in this process , so we can expect a smaller branching ratio for this channel .",
    "besides , the tree diagram involve @xmath91 for factorizable parts and @xmath92 for nonfactorizble parts . as is well - known , @xmath91 is small ( about 0.1 when @xmath93 ) but @xmath92 is as big as 1.1 ( @xmath93 ) , so the factorizable parts can not be so important as the former two .",
    "indeed , we found the nonfactorizable tree diagram is the biggest one though it is nonfactorizable suppressed after calculation .",
    "all our calculations fit well with the predictions and they are shown in section 3 .",
    "= 5.0 in    now we are going to extract these decay channels within the pqcd framework . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the light - cone coordinate system @xcite , then the four - momentum of the b meson and the two @xmath94 mesons in the final state can be written as : @xmath95 in which @xmath96 is defined by @xmath97 . to extract the helicity amplitudes , we parameterize the polarization vectors .",

    "we have to admit the light cone wave functions of mesons are not calculable in principal in pqcd , but they are universal for all the decay channels . so that they can be constraint from the measured other decay channels , like @xmath122 and @xmath123 decays etc @xcite . for the heavy b meson",
