    "<S> however , the disease spreading forecasting is often restricted to numerical simulations , while analytic formulations lack both general results and perturbative approaches since they are subjected to asymmetric time generators . here , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss perturbation theory , approximations and application of many - body techniques in epidemic models in the framework for squared norm of probability vector @xmath0 , in which asymmetric time generators are replaced by their symmetric counterparts .        </S>",
    "<S> proper planning and management lie in the foundation of efficient health and sanitary policies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decision - making process usually relies on predictions from epidemic models and raw data to rule the best available policy to mitigate the disease spreading . </S>",
    "<S> resource planning becomes even more relevant during the emergence of new communicable diseases , as improper actions may extend the duration or adversely impact health workers @xcite . despite the success attained by traditional epidemic models for large scale epidemics in the past , they have been unable to produce reliable predictions for small scale disease spreading in heterogeneous populations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is further enhanced due to the stochastic nature of pathogen transmission mechanisms and patient care . as such , a considerable amount of epidemic models </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed to mimic the correct behavior for spreading of communicable infectious diseases .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model considers the time evolution of a single communicable disease among @xmath1 susceptible ( s ) and infected ( i ) agents  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the infected agents may either transmit the disease to susceptible agents with constant probability @xmath2 , turning them into infected agents @xmath3 , or undergo the recovery process @xmath4 with probability rate @xmath5 , during a fixed time interval @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , two approaches are available to describe the disease spreading in the sis model for a fixed population of size @xmath1 : compartmental and stochastic . in the compartmental approach </S>",
    "<S> relevant quantities are well - described by averages @xcite , from which one derives non - linear differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the number of infected agents @xmath7 , for fixed @xmath1 , in the compartmental sis model is @xmath8 this is the expected behavior for large homogeneous populations , where fluctuations are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of effective transmission ( @xmath9 ) and recovery ( @xmath10 ) probabilities rates contemplates effects due to heterogeneous population . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter estimations employ networks , with size @xmath1 , as substrate to display the varying degree of non - uniformity within a population . in this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , each vertex in the network contains a single agent , while the links among agents are given by the corresponding adjacency matrix @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , non - trivial topological aspects of @xmath11 are incorporated in the effective transmission and cure rates  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic approach also requires networks to describe the population heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrary to the compartmental approach , the assumption about negligible fluctuations is removed , meaning averages alone are not sufficient to properly describe the disease spreading . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , fluctuations are intrinsic components in stochastic formulations and their relevance increases with vanishing @xmath1  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a much more realistic scenario in modeling emergence of small scale epidemics of communicable infectious diseases  @xcite . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> transition probabilities among configurations of @xmath1 agents are expressed by the transition matrix @xmath12 , and take place during the time interval @xmath13  @xcite . the disease transmission and agent recovery </S>",
    "<S> are modeled as probability vector @xmath14 of a markov process with time interval @xmath13 taken to be small enough so that only one recovery or one transmission event takes place in the entire population . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the poissonian assumption  @xcite .    as a closing remark , one notices the transition matrix is analogous to the time evolution operator in quantum theories . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath12 express the time evolution of agent - configurations . despite the striking similarity between both operators , @xmath12 is often asymmetric , restraining its use to small values of @xmath1 for epidemic models in numerical simulations or introducing severe obstacles for analytic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> these issues hinder the systematic development of perturbation theories for agent - based epidemic models , often requiring fresh simulations to forecast the impact of small variations of the parameters of the model , contrary to the rationale behind perturbation theory .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we first briefly review results @xcite derived from the squared norm of the probability vector @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism proposed therein allow us to further explore the operatorial content of the corresponding markov process . more specifically , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the time evolution is also achieved in a framework that only requires eigenvalues derived from hermitian operators . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a constrained multivariate equation , which can be solved by standard optimization techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the fact the time evolution heavily relies on the eigendecomposition and formulate perturbative corrections to epidemic models . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we also discuss methods usually employed in quantum many - body problems and statistical physics , such as the the bethe - peierls approximation @xcite and the holstein - primakoff transformations @xcite . </S>"
