    "despite much effort , the composition of high - energy ( above @xmath3 ev ) cosmic - rays is poorly known .",
    "satellite and balloon experiments have insufficient exposure for high - statistics measurements .",
    "terrestrial experiments have used the electromagnetic and low energy muon components of air showers for composition measurements .",
    "the ratio of electromagnetic to muon energy may be sensitive to the cosmic - ray composition , but it is also sensitive to the physics models used to simulate the air shower .",
    "one critical component of these models is the forward production of hadrons in high - energy interactions .",
    "most of these hadrons are produced at low transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) , where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is not applicable .",
    "a variety of non - pertubative calculations and extrapolations are used to model low @xmath2 particle production , and thereby make predictions about cosmic - ray composition .    here , we present a complementary approach to study air showers , using high energy , high @xmath2 muons to study cosmic - ray composition .",
    "the calculations use pqcd , and so should be well understood .",
    "high @xmath2 muons are produced predominantly in the initial cosmic - ray interaction @xcite , from semileptonic decays of heavy quarks , and from decays of high @xmath2 pions and kaons produced in jet fragmentation .",
    "the rates for muons with @xmath2 above a few gev is calculable in pqcd ; the spectrum depends on the parton composition of the incident ions . for a fixed shower energy ,",
    "the energy per nucleon drops as the atomic number rises , substantially altering the parton density , and so changing the muon spectrum .",
    "this composition may be inferred from the high @xmath2 muon spectrum .",
    "the low@xmath4 parton distributions in nitrogen also contribute in some kinematic areas ; this may be an additional study topic .",
    "the study of high @xmath2 muons requires a surface air shower array combined with a large underground muon detector .",
    "the surface array measures the shower energy , core position and incident direction , and the underground detector measures the energy and position of high - energy muons .",
    "previous experiments have studied high energy muons in air showers , but , with relatively small underground detectors @xcite@xcite .",
    "these experiments did not make use of the distance between the muon and the air shower core .",
    "icecube and icetop comprise a 1 km@xmath0 surface air shower array and a 1 km@xmath5 muon detector @xcite .",
    "the muon detector is big enough to observe muons far from the shower core .",
    "together , the combination can determine the key elements of the event .",
    "icetop will measure the shower energy , core position , and arrival direction .",
    "it will consist of 160 ice - filled tanks spread over a 1 km@xmath0 area@xcite .",
    "it has an energy threshold of about 300 tev .",

    "the combined acceptance will be about 0.3 km@xmath0 sr @xcite .",
    "icecube will measure the energy , position and direction of muons . for vertical muons ,",
    "the energy threshold is about 500 gev muon energy , @xmath6 is measured by determining the muon specific energy loss ( @xmath1 ) . for @xmath7 tev , @xmath1 scales with @xmath6 .    in a sufficiently high energy event",
    ", icecube will observe multiple muons .",
    "most of these muons will have low @xmath2 , and so will cluster around the shower core . in this high - density region , it may not be possible to reconstruct individual muons ; the bundle will be reconstructed as a single light source .",
    "however , far from the core , where the muon density is lower , it should be possible to reconstruct individual tracks .",
    "the separation required to resolve individual tracks is unknown , but 100 meters ( comparable to the spacing between optical module strings ) seems like a safe value .",
    "it is more than 3 times the effective light scattering length of about 30 m @xcite .",
    "with the muon energy and distance from the core determined , the muon @xmath2 may be calculated : @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the muon energy , @xmath9 is its distance from the core , and @xmath10 is the distance from icecube to the site of the initial cosmic - ray interaction in the atmosphere .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is not determined on an event - by - event basis , but its average value ( @xmath11 30 km ) , zenith angle dependence and distribution are well known ; the event - to - event variation and slight composition dependence can be considered in determining the @xmath2 spectrum .    with the conservative @xmath12 m requirement and a 1 tev muon , icecube can study the spectrum for @xmath13 gev / c , covering most of the interesting high @xmath2 region .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , so does the minimum accessible @xmath2 ; for @xmath14 tev , @xmath15 gev / c , while for a 50 tev muon , @xmath16 gev / c . since higher energy muons produce more cherenkov light , they are easier to track , and it is likely that , for higher energy muons , a smaller @xmath9 cut could be used .    the systematic errors in these measurements remain to be studied .",
    "some components are :    \\1 ) uncertainty in the absolute cosmic - ray flux and energy scale .",
    "the flux factors out , since we will only use events observed by icetop .",

    "multiple scattering contributes to @xmath9 , but , far from the core , @xmath9 is dominated by the muon @xmath2 .",
    "thunman , ingelman and gondolo ( tig ) calculated the prompt ( charm only ) and non - prompt muon production using a pythia monte carlo simulation , with the mrs - g parton distribution functions , leading - order pqcd cross - sections for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and standard charm quark hadronization and decay models @xcite .",

    "it finds prompt rates that are comparable to the earlier calculation at 1 tev , but are higher at higher energies ; at 100 tev , the prompt cross section is about 8 times higher @xcite .",
    "the difference is due largely to the different low@xmath4 behavior of the two parton distributions .",
    "bottom quark production was not included .",
    "calculations for the lhc ( at a comparable energy ) find that , for muon @xmath22 gev / c , bottom contributes a larger muon signal than charm @xcite .",
    "for @xmath23 tev , the accompanying shower should almost always trigger icetop ; at lower muon energies , some of the showers may be too small to trigger icetop , so will not be seen .",
    "the prompt signal is significant for @xmath24 ev , although smaller than the non - prompt signal .",

    "the lhc , a cut on @xmath27 gev / c will also eliminate 90 - 98% of the prompt muons@xcite .",
    "although a drastic reduction , this still leaves an interesting sample .",
    "the final cut on @xmath2 ( or @xmath9 ) will depend on the detector 2-track ( core + distant muon ) separation capability .",
    "measurement of the muon @xmath2 spectra has some similarities with the lepton spectra studies done at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum of leptons produced in proton - proton , deuteron - gold and heavy - ion collisions have been studied .",
    "-0.2 in    the rhic experiments fit their data using a multi - component cocktail. for electrons , the cocktail consists of @xmath28 and @xmath29 dalitz decays , @xmath30 conversions , leptonic decays of vector mesons , plus semileptonic decays of heavy mesons and baryons @xcite . for muons ,",
    "the cocktail consists of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and heavy quark decays @xcite . for muons ,",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 decay fraction is reduced with vertex cuts , sample , so this result is not directly relevant to icecube .",
    "however , the electron analysis seems quite relevant .",
    "the fraction of prompt electrons rises with the electron @xmath2 ; for @xmath31 gev / c , prompt electrons are dominant .",
    "additional confidence in these studies comes from the good agreement seen between high @xmath2 @xmath28 data and pqcd calculations@xcite .",
    "simple arguments predict this dominance .",
    "light meson production is predominantly soft ; @xmath32 falls exponentially with @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the meson mass .",
    "in contrast , heavy quark production is described by pqcd , which gives a power law @xmath2 spectrum ; at high enough @xmath2 , this will dominate over any exponential .",
    "pqcd processes also produce high @xmath2 @xmath25 and k , but these mesons are only a small fraction of the total production",
    ".    a similar approach could apply to the @xmath2 spectrum of muons from air showers , with a cocktail of perturbative and non - perturbative non - prompt muons , and prompt muons . for @xmath2 above a few gev / c , the non - perturbative component will be gone , and the remaining events could be fit to a power law spectrum .",
    "spectra could be measured for different muon energies and shower energies .",
    "the muon energies are related to the muon rapidity in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "fig . 1 compares the parton energy spectrum ( in the target frame ) for a @xmath35 ev cosmic ray , for hydrogen ( @xmath36 ) and an @xmath37 nucleus .",
    "the maximum parton energy scales as @xmath38 ; this determines the maximum parton - parton center of mass energy .    for a given collision ,",
    "the @xmath17 values of the parton densities that are probed depend on the kinematics of the produced partons .",
    "so , different muon energies and @xmath2 are sensitive to different @xmath17 regions .    in any collision ,",
    "the maximum possible muon energy is the maximum incident parton energy .",
    "the maximum @xmath2 is half the parton - parton center - of mass energy , @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is cosmic - ray energy , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the @xmath17 of projectile and target partons , and @xmath43 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the corresponding spectra are determined by a calculation that includes the kinematics of the parton production , fragmentation , and semileptonic decays .",
    "it may be worth giving a few examples of the range of @xmath17 values probed , using a a grossly simplified model where the muon takes half of the energy and @xmath2 of the parton produced in the collisions . for an incident @xmath44 ev proton producing a @xmath45 ev muon with @xmath46 gev ( this muon would be in the core , and only distinguishable due to its huge @xmath1 ) , @xmath47 = 0.01 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev@xmath0 . with the same incident particle and muon energy ,",
    "a muon with @xmath50 gev would come from a collision with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev@xmath0 .",
    "studies of high @xmath2 muon production in cosmic - ray air showers appears feasible with icecube and icetop combined .",
    "icetop can measure the air shower energy , incident direction , and core position , while icecube will measure muon energy and distance from the shower core ; these data can be used to determine the muon @xmath2 . for @xmath2 above a few gev , the muon @xmath2 spectrum can be interpreted in terms of perturbative qcd plus and fragmentation functions .",
