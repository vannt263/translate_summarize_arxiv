    "a measurement of the @xmath3 vertex thus provides a stringent test of the sm .",

    "on the other hand , the @xmath1 qcd corrections are found to be modest and sensitivities are only slightly affected by the qcd corrections . in section  iii , we also show that the qcd corrections at high @xmath15 can be significantly reduced and a large fraction of the sensitivity to anomalous couplings lost at supercollider energies can be regained , if a jet veto is imposed , _",

    "this guarantees that a high statistical significance can not arise from a single event at large transverse momentum , where the sm predicts , say , only 0.01 events . in order to derive realistic limits we allow for a normalization uncertainty of 50% in the sm cross section .",
    "background contributions are ignored in our derivation of sensitivity bounds .",
    "our results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the limits for @xmath304 apply for arbitrary values of @xmath162 and vice versa . at the tevatron ,",
    "qcd corrections only slightly influence the sensitivities which can be achieved with 100  pb@xmath308 .",
    "the inclusive nlo @xmath312 and the exclusive nlo @xmath313  jet limits are virtually identical . from the discussion in section  iiid and  iiie",
    "one would expect that the sensitivity limits from the inclusive nlo @xmath312 cross section are somewhat worse than those obtained using the born approximation .",
    "table  1 shows that this is not the case .",
    "this result can be easily understood by noting that only about 11  events with @xmath314  gev are expected in the sm , including @xmath315 qcd corrections , for 100  pb@xmath308 . due to the small number of events , the reduced sensitivity to anomalous @xmath3 couplings originating from the shape change induced by the @xmath1 corrections at large photon transverse momenta",
    "is not reflected in the bounds which can be achieved for the anomalous couplings . the slight improvement with respect to the limits obtained using",
    "the born approximation is due to the increased cross section in the inclusive nlo case .    at ssc energies ,",
    "the situation changes quite drastically .",
    "inclusive nlo qcd corrections reduce the sensitivity to @xmath304 ( @xmath162 ) by a factor @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) , although the inclusive @xmath1 corrections increase the total cross section by more than a factor  3 .",
    "furthermore , interference effects between the sm and anomalous terms in the helicity amplitudes considerably increase when inclusive nlo qcd corrections are taken into account . as a result ,",
    "the bounds in the inclusive nlo case depend significantly on the sign of the anomalous coupling , in contrast to the limits obtained in the born approximation .",
    "the increase of these interference effects is due to the logarithmic enhancement factor which is present in the sm quark - gluon fusion term at large photon transverse momenta .",
    "a large portion of the sensitivity lost in the inclusive nlo case can be regained if a jet veto is imposed .",
    "the nlo @xmath296  jet limits are typically 10  20% weaker than those obtained in the born approximation and depend only marginally on the jet definition criteria . in section  iiie we found that the nlo @xmath20  jet differential cross section is more stable to variations of the factorization scale @xmath21 than the born and inclusive nlo @xmath273 cross sections ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : qscale ] and  [ fig : last]a ) .",
    "the systematic errors which originate from the choice of @xmath21 thus will be smaller for bounds derived from the nlo @xmath20  jet differential cross section than those for limits obtained from the inclusive nlo @xmath273 or the born cross section .",
    "note that the results shown in table  1 automatically imply that @xmath274  jet production , with a high transverse momentum jet , will be less sensitive to anomalous @xmath3 couplings than @xmath20  jet production .",
    "the bounds shown in table  1 have been derived for a dipole form factor ( @xmath165 ) with a scale of @xmath260  tev . at tevatron energies ,",
    "the sensitivities achievable are insensitive to the exact form and the scale of the form factor ( for @xmath318  gev ) . at the ssc",
    ", the situation is different and the sensitivity bounds depend significantly on the value chosen for @xmath117  @xcite . for @xmath319  tev , for example , the limits of table  1b improve by a factor @xmath320 ( @xmath321 ) for @xmath304 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the bounds in the inclusive nlo case are again weaker by up to a factor of  2 compared to those obtained in the born approximation . if a jet veto is imposed , the sensitivities achievable are very similar to those found in the born approximation .",
    "the usefulness of the zero jet requirement , thus , does not depend on details of the form factor assumed for the non - standard @xmath3 couplings .    in table  1 , we have shown sensitivity limits only for the tevatron and ssc . at lhc energies ,",
    "the situation is very similar to that encountered at the ssc . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath309  pb@xmath308 , the sensitivities which can be achieved at the lhc are about a factor 1.5 worse than those expected for the ssc .",
    "the bounds displayed in table  1 are quite conservative . if @xmath322 decays and , at the ssc , @xmath323 production are included , the limits can easily be improved by 20  40% .",
    "further improvements may result from using more powerful statistical tools than the simple @xmath324 test we performed .",
    "our results , however , clearly demonstrate the advantage of a jet veto to probe the structure of the @xmath3 vertex in @xmath4 production at hadron supercolliders .",
    "@xmath4 production in hadronic collisions provides an opportunity to probe the structure of the @xmath3 vertex in a direct and essentially model independent way .",
    "previous studies of @xmath325  @xcite have been based on leading order calculations . in this paper",
    "we have presented an @xmath1 calculation of the reaction @xmath93 for general , @xmath2 conserving , @xmath3 couplings , using a combination of analytic and monte carlo integration techniques .",
    "the @xmath326 decay has been included in the narrow width approximation in our calculation . in this approximation ,",
    "diagrams in which the photon is radiated off the final state lepton line are not necessary to maintain electromagnetic gauge invariance . for suitable cuts these diagrams",
    "can thus be ignored , which considerably simplifies the calculation .",
    "@xmath8 decay spin correlations are correctly taken into account in our approach , except in the finite virtual contribution .",
    "the finite virtual correction term contributes only at the per cent level to the total cross section and @xmath8 decay spin correlations can thus be safely ignored here .",
    "the photon @xmath268 differential cross section is very sensitive to non - standard @xmath3 couplings .",
    "we found that qcd corrections significantly change the shape of this distribution .",
    "this shape change is due to a combination of destructive interference in the @xmath4 born subprocess and a logarithmic enhancement factor in the @xmath270 and @xmath327 real emission subprocesses .",
    "the destructive interference suppresses the size of the @xmath4 born cross section and is also responsible for the radiation amplitude zero .",
    "the logarithmic enhancement factor originates in the high @xmath234 region of phase space where the photon is balanced by a high @xmath268 quark which radiates a soft @xmath8 boson .",
    "the logarithmic enhancement factor and the large gluon density make the @xmath328 corrections large at high @xmath234 , especially when the center of mass energy is large .",
    "since the feynman diagrams responsible for the enhancement at large photon transverse momenta do not involve the @xmath3 vertex , inclusive nlo qcd corrections to @xmath329 production tend to reduce the sensitivity to non - standard couplings . at the tevatron , for an integrated luminosity of 100  pb@xmath308 ,",
    "this effect is overwhelmed by the increase in cross section induced by the qcd corrections .",
    "due to the very large quark - gluon luminosity at the lhc and ssc , however , one expects that the sensitivity bounds which can be achieved at those machines are reduced by up to a factor  2 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the size of the qcd corrections at large photon transverse momenta may be reduced substantially and a large fraction of the sensitivity to anomalous @xmath3 couplings which was lost at ssc and lhc energies may be regained by imposing a jet veto , _",
    "i.e. _ , by considering the exclusive @xmath20  jet channel instead of inclusive @xmath273 production .",
    "such a `` zero - jet '' requirement may be also very helpful to suppress the background from @xmath330 production  @xcite at the lhc and ssc .",
    "furthermore , we found that the dependence of the nlo @xmath20  jet cross section on the factorization scale @xmath21 is significantly reduced compared to that of the inclusive nlo @xmath273 cross section .",
    "uncertainties which originate from the variation of @xmath21 thus will be smaller for sensitivity bounds obtained from the @xmath20  jet channel than those for limits derived from the inclusive nlo @xmath273 cross section .",
    "although the magnitude of the qcd corrections at ssc energies is significantly reduced if a jet veto is imposed , the residual nlo corrections to @xmath20  jet production are still quite large , in particular for small values of @xmath15 , and can not be ignored .",
    "this also means that in order to complete our understanding of qcd corrections in @xmath4 production , a full calculation of the @xmath331 corrections at ssc energies will be necessary .",
    "these corrections have recently been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the soft - plus - virtual gluon approximation for cern @xmath127 collider and tevatron energies .",
    "jet vetoing may also be useful to reduce the size of the @xmath11 corrections .",
    "our results show that nlo qcd corrections only slightly influence the sensitivity limits which can be achieved at the tevatron",
    ". nevertheless , it will be important to take these corrections into account when extracting information on the structure of the @xmath3 vertex , in order to reduce systematic and theoretical errors . at the lhc and ssc",
    "it will be absolutely necessary to take into account the effects of higher order qcd corrections when experimental data and theoretical predictions for @xmath4 production are compared .",
