    "the physics of skiing has recently been described in a rather comprehensive book  @xcite which also contains further references of interest .",
    "the current article is devoted to a discussion of the forces acting on a skier or snowboarder , and to the derivation of an equation which describes `` ideal carving '' , including applications of this concept in practice and possible speculative implications for the design of technically advanced skis and snowboards . in a carved turn , it is the bent , curved edge of the ski or snowboard which forms some sort of `` railroad track '' along which the trajectory of the curve is being followed , as opposed to more traditional curves which are triggered by deliberate slippage of the bottom surface of the ski relative to the snow .",
    "the edges of traditional skis have a nearly straight - line geometry .",
    "by contrast , carving skis ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) have a manifestly nonvanishing sidecut .",
    "typical carving skis have a sidecut radius of the order of @xmath0 at a chord length of @xmath1 .",
    "however , parameters used in various models may be adapted to the intended application : e.g. , models designed for less narrow curves may have a sidecut radius @xmath2 of about @xmath3 at a length of @xmath4 .",
    "skis suited for very narrow slalom curves have an @xmath2 of about @xmath5 at a length of up to @xmath6 .",
    "a typical version suited for off - piste freestyle skiing features a typical length of @xmath7 at a sidecut radius of @xmath8 .",
    "overhead view on a typical carving ski .",
    "the tip of the ski points to the right .",
    "the geometry of the carving equipment involves the contact length @xmath9 , the sidecut @xmath10 as well as the sidecut radius @xmath2 . for a more traditional ski",
    ", the sidecut would be negligibly small , resulting in a very large sidecut radius . ]",
    "the sidecut has been introduced first into the world of snow - related leisure activity by the snowboard where the wider profile of the instrument allowed for a realization of a rather marked sidecut without stringent demands on the materials used .",
    "the carved turn is the preferred turning procedure on a snowboard .",
    "skidding should be avoided in competitions as far as possible because it necessarily entails frictional losses . in practical situations ,",
    "carving skiers and snowboarders may realize astonishingly high tilt angles @xmath11 in the range of @xmath12 $ ] ( the `` tilt angle '' is the angle of line joining the board and the center - of - mass of the skier or boarder with the normal to the surface of the ski slope ) .",
    "in snowboarding , the transition from a right to a left turn is then often executed by jumping , with the idea of `` glueing together '' the trajectories of two perfect carved turns , again avoiding frictional losses .",
    "the sidecut radius @xmath2 of a snowboard may assume values as low as 68@xmath13 at a typical chord length between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ stoward ] , we proceed towards the derivation of the `` ideal - carving equation '' , which involves rather elementary considerations that we chose to present in some detail . the geometry of sidecut radius is discussed in section  [ sssidecut ] , and we then proceed from the simplest case of the forces acting along a trajectory perpendicular to the fall line ( section  [ ssperp ] ) to more general situations  ( section  [ ssgeneral ] ) . the projection of the forces in directions parallel and perpendicular to the skier s trajectory lead to the concept of `` effective weight ''  ( section  [ ssweight ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of a centrifugal force acting in a curve allows us to generalize this concept ( section  [ ssacting ] ) . in section  [ sice ] , we discuss the `` ideal - carving equation '' , including applications .",
    "the actual derivation of the `` ideal - carving equation '' in section  [ ssderivation ] is an easy exercise , in view of the preparations made in section  [ stoward ] .",
    "an alternative form of this equation has already appeared in  @xcite ; in the current article we try to reformulate the equation in a form which we believe is more suitable for practical applications .",
    "the consequences which follow from the `` ideal - carving equation '' are discussed in section  [ ssgraphical ] .",
    "finally , we mention some implications for the design of skis and boards in section  [ sconclusions ] .",
    "according to figure  [ fig1 ] , an approximate formula for the smooth curve described by the edge of the ski is @xmath16 .",
    "this relation implies @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we approximately have @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the sidecut radius of the ski . we then have @xmath19 along the edge of the ski . for @xmath20",
    "we have @xmath21 and therefore @xmath22 a typical carving ski with a chord length of @xmath15 may have a sidecut radius as low as @xmath23 . estimating the contact length to be about @xmath24 of the chord length , we arrive at @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum width of a ski ( at the end of the contact curve ) is of the order of @xmath26 , so that a sidecut of about @xmath27 will lead to a minimum width which is roughly two thirds of the maximum width , leading to high structural demands on the material .",
    "a typical snowboard has a length of about @xmath28 and a width of about @xmath29 .",
    "the contact length is @xmath30 in a typical case .",
    "a sidecut of @xmath31 results , which means that for a typical snowboard , the relative difference of the minimum width to the maximum width is only @xmath32 .",
    "as the ski describes a carved turn , the radius of curvature @xmath33 along the trajectory varies with the angle of inclination @xmath11 of the normal to the ski slope with the normal to the ski surface . for @xmath34 , we of course have @xmath35 .",
    "an elementary geometrical consideration shows that the effective sidecut @xmath36 at inclination @xmath11 is given by @xmath37 the inclination - dependent sidecut - radius is therefore @xmath38      the angle of inclination of the ski slope against the horizontal is @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we assume the skier s trajectory to be exactly horizontal .",
    "the work done by the gravitational force vanishes , and the skier , under ideal conditions , neither decelerates nor accelerates .",
    "the skiing trajectory is indicated as parallel to a horizontal that lies in the plane described by the ski slope .",
    "that plane , in turn , is inclined against the horizontal by an angle @xmath40 . of course , the angle @xmath40 is equal to the angle of @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the force exerted on the skier in the gravitational field of the earth is @xmath43 .",
    "it may be decomposed into a component @xmath44 perpendicular to the plane described by the ski slope , and a component @xmath45 lying in the plane of the slope . ]      in a more general case , the angle of the skier s trajectory with the horizontal is denoted by @xmath50 . within a right curve , @xmath50 varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , whereas within a left - hand curve , @xmath50 varies from an initial value of @xmath52 to a final value of @xmath51 .",
    "the elementary geometrical considerations follow from figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this figure illustrates vector decomposition in a more general case .",
    "the skier s trajectory describes an angle @xmath50 with the horizontal and is explicitly indicated in the figure by the straight line parallel to @xmath53 .",
    "the force @xmath45 , which is acting inside the slope plane , is decomposed into a lateral force @xmath54 and a force @xmath53 which is parallel to the skier s trajectory and leads to an acceleration .",
    "of course , the force @xmath44 is perpendicular to the slope . ]    for a skier s trajectory directly in the fall line , we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , resulting in maximum acceleration along the fall line .",
    "let @xmath58 be a unit vector tangent to the skier s trajectory , i.e.   @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the direction of @xmath53 is displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "an analytic expression for @xmath58 can easily be obtained by starting from a unit vector @xmath61 as implied by the conventions used in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we first rotate @xmath61 about the @xmath62-axis by an angle @xmath63 , and obtain a vector @xmath64 . a further rotation about the @xmath65-axis by an angle @xmath66 leads to the vector @xmath58 .",
    "of course , a rotation of @xmath61 by @xmath63 leads to @xmath67 .",
    "the rotation of @xmath64 about the @xmath65-axis by an angle @xmath40 , which `` rotates @xmath64 into the ski slope '' , is expressed as a rotation matrix , @xmath68 then , by projection , @xmath69 and the modulus of the vector @xmath53 is @xmath70 the force @xmath54 perpendicular to the track direction is then easily calculated with the help of equation  ( [ deffs ] ) , @xmath71 resulting in @xmath72 this force has to be compensated by the snow , under the approximation of vanishing slippage .",
    "according to figure  [ fig3 ] , the gravitational force may be decomposed as @xmath73 .",
    "the force @xmath53 simply accelerates the skier .",
    "the force @xmath74 therefore has to be compensated by the snow .",
    "therefore , to avoid slippage , the skier should balance her / his weight in such a way that his / her center - of - mass is joined with the ski along a straight line parallel to the direction given by the effective weight vector @xmath75 , @xmath76 we immediately obtain @xmath77     the skier s trajectory is as indicated in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the effective weight of the skier is @xmath75 .",
    "we remember that @xmath44 is perpendicular to the ski slope . in order to avoid slippage ,",
    "the line joining the ski boots and the skier s center - of - mass must be parallel to @xmath75 .",
    "the tilt angle of the skier with the normal to the ski slope is equal to the angle of @xmath78 with @xmath79 ; this angle is denoted by the symbol  @xmath11 in the text . ]",
    "we call @xmath11 the angle of inclination or tilt angle . for obvious reasons",
    ", we assume this angle to be in the range @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "the angle @xmath11 also enters in the inclination - dependent sidecut radius as given in equation ( [ rphi ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the question how @xmath11 is related to @xmath40 and @xmath50 . to this end , we first calculate @xmath81 we now apply the identity @xmath82 = \\sqrt{1-x^2}/x$ ] to both sides of this equation . the left - hand side becomes just @xmath83 , and the right - hand side simplifies to @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , we observe that @xmath44 , @xmath54 and @xmath75 are vectors in one and the same plane . because @xmath44 is perpendicular to the ski slope and @xmath54 is a vector in the plane formed by the slope , both vectors are at right angles to each other ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath85      in a turn ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) , the centrifugal inertial force @xmath86 , @xmath87 has to be added to or subtracted from the lateral gravitational force @xmath88 to obtain the total radial force , which we name @xmath89 in order to differentiate it from @xmath54 . in the second ( `` lower '' ) half of a left as well as in the second ( `` lower '' ) half of a right curve ,",
    "the centrifugal force is parallel to the lateral force , and the positive sign prevails in equation ( [ deffc ] ) .",
    "by contrast , in the upper half of either a curve , the centrifugal force is antiparallel to the lateral force , and the negative sign should be chosen .",
    "we have ( see equations ( [ deffn ] ) , ( [ deffs ] )  and  [ defflat ] ) ) @xmath90 the force @xmath54 may be parallel or antiparallel to the centrifugal force , resulting in a different formula for @xmath89 in each case , @xmath91 the new effective weight is @xmath92 the tilt angle changes as we replace @xmath93 .",
    "we denote the new tile angle by @xmath94 as opposed to @xmath11 ( see equation  ( [ defphi ] ) ) . using a relation analogous to ( [ cosphi ] ) , @xmath95 or by an elementary geometrical consideration ( using the orthogonality of @xmath89 and @xmath44 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath96 furthermore , we assume the skier s velocity to be sufficiently large that the centrifugal force dominates the lateral force ; in this case we have @xmath97 along the entire curve . in this case , for a right curve , with @xmath98 at the outset and @xmath99 at the end of the curve , and with @xmath100 changing sign at @xmath55 , the correct sign in equation ( [ tanphi ] ) is @xmath101     the total lateral force @xmath89 in a curve is the sum of @xmath54 given in ( [ defflat ] ) and the centrifugal force @xmath86 defined in ( [ deffc ] ) .",
    "this leads to a modified effective weight @xmath102 . for the centrifugal force to act",
    "as shown in the figure , the skier s trajectory is required to describe a left - hand curve , as displayed . ]",
    "up to this point we have mainly followed the discussion outlined on pp .",
    "76104 and pp .  208215 of  @xcite . under the assumption of a perfect carved turn",
    ", the instantaneous curvature radius @xmath33 , which is determined by the bent edges of the ski , depends on the sidecut radius @xmath2 and on the tilt angle @xmath94 as follows ( see equation ( [ rphi ] ) ) , @xmath103 however , the assumption of a carved turn requires that the effective weight @xmath102 be acting along the straight line joining the ski boots and the center - of - mass of the skier .",
    "this means that the angle @xmath94 also has to fulfill the equation ( [ tanphi ] ) which we specialize to the case ( [ fastright ] ) in the sequel , @xmath104 in view of ( [ rphi ] ) , we have @xmath105 combining ( [ ingredient1 ] ) and ( [ ingredient2 ] ) , we obtain the _ ideal - carving equation _ @xmath106 the variables of the ideal - carving equation are the velocity @xmath107 of the skier , the angle @xmath50 of the trajectory of the skier with the horizontal , and the instantaneous curvature radius @xmath33 of the skier s trajectory .",
    "the parameters of ( [ ice ] ) are the inclination of the ski slope @xmath40 , the acceleration of gravity @xmath108 , and the sidecut radius @xmath2 of the ski .",
    "under appropriate substitutions , this equation is equivalent to equation ( t5.3 ) on p.  209 of  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , the tilt angle is eliminated from the equation in our formulation .",
    "alternatively speaking , the ideal - carving equation defines a function    [ surf ] @xmath109 so that the equation @xmath110    defines the `` ideal - carving surface '' as a 2-dimensional imbedded in a three - dimensional space spanned by @xmath107 , @xmath33 , and @xmath50 .",
    "likewise , we may consider the ideal - gas equation    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the pressure , @xmath113 denotes the volume , @xmath114 the number of atoms , @xmath115 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath116 the absolute temperature .",
    "the ideal - gas equation may trivially be rewritten as follows , @xmath117    of course , the equation @xmath118 then defines a ( two - dimensional ) surface embedded in @xmath119 .",
    "the ideal - gas equation entails the idealization of perfect thermodynamic equilibrium , yet in realistic processes a gas volume will not always be in such a state . nevertheless , in order to avoid sub - optimal performance within a carnot - like process ( or by analogy : in order to avoid frictional losses when skiing ) , one may strive to keep the system as close to equilibrium as possible at all times .",
    "the solutions of ( [ surf ] ) define a ( two - dimensional ) surface embedded in @xmath120 $ ] . in figure  [ fig6 ] , the surface defined by equation ( [ surfb ] )",
    "is represented for the parameter combination @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the ideal - carving manifold for the parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the variables are the skier s velocity @xmath107 , the instantaneous radius of curvature @xmath33 , and the angle @xmath50 of the skier s trajectory with the horizontal . ]",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] gives us rather important information .",
    "in particular , we see that maintaining the ideal - carving condition while going through a curve of constant radius of curvature , within the interval @xmath98 to @xmath99 , implies a decrease in the skier s speed .",
    "this is possible only if the frictional force , antiparallel to @xmath53 , provides for sufficient deceleration .",
    "of course , under ideal racing conditions the skier will accelerate rather than decelerate during her / his descent .     a hypothetical trajectory of a skier maintaining the ideal - carving condition ( [ surf ] ) during a right turn .",
    "parameters are the same as in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "note that the skier s velocity decreases from @xmath124 to @xmath125 during the turn . ]",
    "acceleration during a turn is compatible with the ideal carving condition only if the instantaneous radius of curvature significantly decreases during the turn .",
    "this corresponds to a turn in which the skier starts off with a very wide turn , gradually making the turn more tight during his / her descent .",
    "the pattern generated is that of the letter `` j '' , and the corresponding curve is therefore commonly referred to as a `` j - curve ''  @xcite .",
    "the practical necessities of world - cup racing prevent such trajectories .",
    "typical tilt angles are too high , and typical centrifugal forces too large to be sustainable in practice on the idealized trajectories .",
    "this is why we see snow spraying even in highly competitive world - cup slalom and giant slalom skiing .     the ideal - carving manifold in the range of small @xmath33 .",
    "parameters are the same as figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] . ]",
    "however , there is yet another very important restriction to the possibility of maintaining ideal - carving conditions at all times : an inspection of figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] suggests that for an appreciable radius of curvature , the velocity @xmath107 decreases monotonically with the radius , @xmath50 being held constant .",
    "we now investigate the specific velocity compatible with ideal - carving conditions at very tight turns @xmath126 .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath94 tends to values close to @xmath127 in this case , because @xmath128 solving equation  ( [ ice ] ) for @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath129 this latter relation holds independent of @xmath50 , and this virtual independence of @xmath50 is represented graphically in figure  [ fig8 ] for small @xmath33 . as suggested by figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] , it is impossible to maintain ideal - carving conditions if the skier s velocity considerably exceeds the limiting velocity @xmath130 we investigate this question in more detail . for given @xmath33 , the maximum @xmath107",
    "is attained for @xmath131 because in this case , the centrifugal force is most effectively compensated by the lateral force @xmath54 . in this case , @xmath132 & = & v_{\\rm limit } \\ ,",
    "\\left(1 + \\tan(\\alpha)\\ , \\left(\\frac{r}{r_{\\rm sc}}\\right ) - \\frac{2 + \\tan^2(\\alpha)}{8}\\,\\left ( \\frac{r}{r_{\\rm sc } } \\right)^2 + { \\cal o}(r^2)\\right ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximum @xmath107 for which the ideal - carving condition can possibly be fulfilled is then determined by the condition @xmath133 which , upon considering the first two nonvanishing terms in the taylor expansion ( [ taylor ] ) for small @xmath134 , leads to    @xmath135    a result which happens to be exact up to the order of @xmath136 .",
    "the exact solution is surprisingly simple , @xmath137    the maximum velocity compatible with ideal - carving conditions is independent of @xmath40 , @xmath138 it implies a tilt angle @xmath139 at @xmath140 .",
    "the velocity @xmath141 , of course , equals the velocity of a body on a circular trajectory of radius @xmath2 with the centrifugal force being compensated by an acceleration of magnitude @xmath108 toward the center .",
    "observe , however , that in the current case the instantaneous radius of curvature is @xmath142 .",
    "a numerical example : for @xmath23 , and @xmath143 , we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the limiting velocity deviates by about @xmath146 and is given by @xmath147 .",
    "both the limiting velocity @xmath148 as well as the maximum velocity @xmath141 are given purely as a function of the parameters of the ideal - carving equation ( [ ice ] ) : these are the acceleration of gravity @xmath108 , the sidecut radius @xmath2 , and the inclination of the ski slope @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that for typical parameters as given in figure  [ fig8 ] , the ideal velocity of the skier varies only within about @xmath149 for all radii of curvature in the interval @xmath150 $ ] , and all possible @xmath50 .",
    "that is to say , the limiting @xmath148 also gives a good indication of the velocity range under which a carving ski , or a snowboard , can operate under nearly ideal - carving conditions ( see also figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the limiting velocity @xmath148 [ eq .  ( [ vlimit ] ) ]",
    "is displayed for typical inclinations of the ski slope @xmath40 . for velocities",
    "appreciably beyond @xmath151 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ vlimit ] ) and  ( [ vmax ] ) ] , it is impossible to maintain ideal - carving conditions . ]",
    "in section  [ stoward ] , we have discussed in detail the forces acting on a skier during a carved turn , as well as basic geometric properties of carving skis and snowboards . in section  [ sice ] , we have discussed in detail the derivation of the ideal - carving equation ( [ ice ] ) which establishes a relation between the skier s velocity , the radius of curvature of the skier s trajectory and the angle of the skier s course with the horizontal .",
    "this equation determines an ideal - carving manifold whose properties have been discussed in section  [ ssgraphical ] , with graphical representations for typical parameters to be found in figures  [ fig6][fig9 ] . in particular , the limiting velocity @xmath148 as given in equation ( [ vlimit ] ) indicates an ideal operational velocity of a carving ski as a function of the angle of inclination of the ski slope and of the sidecut radius .",
    "the range of the limiting velocities indicated in figure  [ fig9 ] are well below those attained in world - cup downhill skiing . in downhill skiing ,",
    "the usage of skis with an appreciable sidecut is therefore not indicated . however , the velocity range of figure  [ fig9 ] is well within the typical values attained in slalom races .",
    "it is therefore evident that carving skis are well suited for such races , in theory as well as in practice .",
    "a slalom with tight turns , which implies a rather slow operational velocity due to the necessity of changing the trajectory within the reaction time of a human being , demands slalom skis with a smaller sidecut radius than those suited for a rather flat slope and wide turns .",
    "note that a smaller sidecut radius implies a larger actual sidecut @xmath10 according to equation ( [ rsc ] ) .",
    "it may well be beneficial for a slalom skier to have a look at the actual course , and to measure the average steepness of the slope , and to choose an appropriate ski from a given selection , before starting her / his race .",
    "we will now discuss possible further improvements in the design of carving skis .",
    "to this end we draw an analogy to the steering of a bicycle traveling on an inclined surface .",
    "the driver is supposed not to exert any force via the action of the pedals of the bicycle . indeed ,",
    "during the ride on a bicycle , the driver can maintain ideal-``carving '' conditions under rather general circumstances , avoiding slippage .",
    "one might ask why a bicycle driver can accomplish this while a carving skier or snowboarder can not .",
    "the reason is the following : equation ( [ rphi ] ) defines a relation between the tilt angle @xmath94 and the instantaneous radius of curvature @xmath33 .",
    "when riding a bicycle , one may freely adjust the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath33 via the steering . on carving skis ,",
    "the position of the `` steering '' is always uniquely related to the tilt angle @xmath94 by equation  ( [ rphi ] ) . on a bicycle , it is possible to use a small steering angle even if one leans substantially toward the center of the curve . on a carving ski ,",
    "the `` steering angle '' automatically becomes large when the tilt angle is large , resulting in a small radius of curvature ( again under the assumption of `` ideal - carving '' conditions ) .",
    "this circumstance eventually leads to the limiting velocity @xmath148 beyond which it is impossible to operate a carving ski under ideal - carving conditions , as represented by equation  ( [ vmax ] ) . beyond the limiting velocity , the non - fulfillment of the ideal - carving equation is visible by spraying snow .",
    "by contrast , on a bicycle , it is possible to adjust the steering of the front wheel so that the radius of curvature as defined by the relative inclination of the front and rear wheels , and the inclination @xmath94 of the bicycle itself , fulfill the ideal - carving equation  ( [ ice ] ) .",
    "a carving ski that offers the possibility of steering could be constructed with the help of an inertial measurement device ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this device is supposed to continuously read the tilt angle @xmath94 , the velocity of the skier @xmath107 and the instantaneous radius of curvature @xmath33 , as well as the angle @xmath50 and the inclination of the ski slope @xmath40 . according to equation ( [ ice ] ) , these variables determine an ideal sidecut radius @xmath2 which could be adjusted dynamically by a servo motor . in this case",
    ", it would be possible to fulfill near - ideal - carving conditions along the entire trajectory .",
    "a first step in this direction would be simpler device that measures only the inclination of the ski slope @xmath40 and determines a near - ideal sidecut radius according to equation  ( [ vlimit ] ) .",
    "the authors thank sabine jentschura and hans - ulrich fahrbach for carefully reading the manuscript , and for helpful discussions .        for a brief overview see e.g.  u. kilian , physics journal ( `` physik journal '' of the german physical society ) * 2 * ( october issue ) , 56 ( 2003 ) .",
    "simplified inertial measurement system are currently used in devices as small as computer mice .",
    "they are usually called `` gyroscopes '' in the literature although the technical realization is sometimes based on different principles ( for example , optical gyroscopes or micromechanical devices ) ."
