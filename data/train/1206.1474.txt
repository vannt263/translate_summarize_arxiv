    "in this paper we consider solutions of quasilinear second order elliptic partial differential equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are carathodory functions under certain structural conditions discussed in section  [ sect : structural ] .",
    "a noteworthy example of such equations is the @xmath3-laplace equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 , which gives the laplace equation when @xmath6 ; we refer to @xcite .",

    "the study of certain vanishing properties , unique continuation in particular , is rather complete @xcite .",
    "the non - linear case , on the other hand , is more or less open , although there are some results ; we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "in particular , some counterexamples are constructed in the case of @xmath19 in , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , the author shows that there is a solution that vanishes in the lower half space @xmath22 of @xmath23 but does not vanish identically in @xmath23 .",
    "our approach in this note is based on the analysis of nodal domains , which are maximal connected components of the set @xmath24 and nodal lines @xmath25 which are the boundaries of nodal domains .",
    "our main tool is to couple the strong maximum principle and the harnack inequality with some topological arguments ; this argument applies in the situation in which there are finite number of nodal domains . the topological approach taken in the paper",
    "can be applied also to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem involving the @xmath3-laplacian and to more general eigenvalue problems constituting the fuik spectrum .",
    "we refer to a recent paper @xcite for more details .",
    "finally , we want to refer to @xcite since the framework and some ideas there are somewhat related to those taken in the present note .      throughout , @xmath7 is a bounded simply - connected jordan domain of @xmath8 .",
    "a domain is an open connected set in @xmath8 .",
    "we write @xmath26 for concentric open balls of radii @xmath27 centered at some @xmath15 .",
    "we denote the closure , interior , exterior , and boundary of @xmath28 by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",

    "we could also allow for the following structural conditions @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath5 .",
    "in this case local hlder continuity and the harnack inequality for a locally bounded weak solution of follow from trudinger  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the case in which @xmath33 and @xmath34 may depend on @xmath9 , or , for that matter , aim at the most general structure in or .",

    "a jordan arc is a point set which is homeomorphic with @xmath42 $ ] , wheras a jordan curve is a point set which is homeomorphic with a circle . by jordan s curve theorem",
    "a jordan curve in @xmath8 has two complementary domains , and the curve is the boundary of each component .",
    "one of these two domains is bounded and this domain is called the interior of the jordan curve . a domain",
    "whose boundary is a jordan curve is called a jordan domain .    as a related note",
    ", it is well known that the boundary of a bounded simply - connected domain in the plane is connected .",
    "in the plane a simply - connected domain @xmath43 can be defined by the property that all points in the interior of any jordan curve , which consists of points of @xmath43 , are also points of @xmath43 @xcite .    a jordan arc with one end - point on @xmath44 and all its other points in @xmath41 ,",
    "is called an end - cut .",
    "if both end - points are in @xmath45 , and the rest in @xmath41 , a jordan arc is said to be a cross - cut in @xmath41 .",

    "accessible boundary points of a planar domain are aplenty : the accessible points of @xmath45 are dense in @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are distinct points , then an @xmath47-chain of points joining @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a finite sequence of points @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , for @xmath52 .",

    "if a connected set of points in @xmath8 intersects both @xmath41 and @xmath55 it intersects @xmath45 ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.3 , p. 73 ) .",
    "lastly , we recall the following topological property @xcite .",
    "a subset @xmath28 of @xmath8 is said to be locally connected at any @xmath56 if for every @xmath54 there exists @xmath57 such that any two points of @xmath58 are joined by a connected set in @xmath59 .",
    "a set is uniformly locally connected , if for every @xmath54 there exists @xmath57 such that all pairs of points , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for which @xmath60 can be joined by a connected subset of diameter less than @xmath47 . all convex domains and ,",
    "more generally , jordan domains are uniformly locally connected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 14.1 , p. 161 ) .",
    "however , simply - connected domains are not necessarily locally connected .",
    "we may interpret equation in the weak sense .",
    "we recall that it follows from the structural assumptions ( or ) that a weak solution to is hlder continuous and satisfies the following harnack inequality .",
    "we refer to serrin  @xcite . the proof is based on the moser iteration method @xcite .",
    "we also point out the following important property , the strong maximum principle , which can be deduced from the harnack inequality .",
    "we refer to a monograph by pucci and serrin  @xcite on maximum principles .",
    "we shall make use of the fact that if @xmath9 is a solution to , then @xmath64 , @xmath65 , is also a solution to an equation similar to .",
    "hence harnack s inequality and the strong maximum principle apply to both @xmath9 and @xmath64 .",
    "[ thm : uniquecont ] suppose @xmath9 is a solution to the equation under structural conditions ( or , and @xmath9 locally bounded ) in a bounded simply - connected jordan domain @xmath7 of @xmath8 subject to the dirichlet condition @xmath66 where @xmath11 .",
    "we assume further that for all @xmath15 there exists @xmath16 such that for all @xmath17 the set @xmath18 is connected .",
    "if @xmath14 has finite number of relative maximum and minimum values , and if @xmath9 vanishes in some open subset of @xmath7 , then @xmath9 vanishes identically in @xmath7 .",
    "we could also state the result as follows : if @xmath9 is a constant in some open subset of @xmath7 , then @xmath9 is identically constant in @xmath7 . in",
    "what follows , however , we stick to the classical formulation by dealing with a vanishing solution .",
    "the crux of the proof is to study so - called nodal domains .",
    "a maximal connected component , i.e. one that is not a strict subset of any other connected set , of the set @xmath67 is called , in what follows , a nodal domain .",
    "we denote these components by @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "we remark that if @xmath9 is , for instance , a solution to the @xmath3-laplace equation it is not known whether the number of nodal domains is finite .    in the proof of the following key lemma , we make use of the fact that @xmath7 is a jordan domain , and more precisely , @xmath7 is uniformly locally connected at every @xmath70 , we refer to section  [ sect : topology ] .          by the strong maximum principle the set @xmath76 contains a global maximum of @xmath9 in @xmath71 .",
    "we then show that such maximum point @xmath77 is also a relative maximum of @xmath78 on @xmath12 : let @xmath79 be a maximum point of @xmath9 on some fixed nodal domain @xmath71 .",
    "we shall then apply local connedtedness of @xmath7 at every boundary point @xmath80 ( section  [ sect : topology ] ) .",
    "we claim next that there exists @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , for each @xmath83 , contains only points of @xmath71 . but assume , for now , that this is not the case .",
    "hence for each @xmath83 there exists @xmath84 such that @xmath85 belongs to some other nodal domain than @xmath71 , say , @xmath72 or @xmath86 .",
    "obviously , we need to consider only the former case .",
    "we write @xmath87 .",
    "there exists a positive @xmath88 such that @xmath89 for every @xmath90 ( it can be verified that such points exist since @xmath7 is a jordan domain ) .",
    "moreover , since there exists a point @xmath91 such that @xmath92 and @xmath7 is locally connected at every @xmath70 , there must exist also a point @xmath93 so that @xmath94 . for small enough @xmath95",
    "this is not possible since @xmath9 is continuous and @xmath96 .",
    "it follows that the inequality @xmath98 is valid both for every @xmath99 and for every @xmath100 ( in fact @xmath101 as sets ) .",
    "hence each maximum point @xmath77 constitutes a relative maximum of @xmath78 on @xmath12 .",
    "an analogous reasoning applies for minima and relative minima on @xmath72 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "our idea in the proof of the preceding lemma has certain similarity to that of lemma 1.1 in alessandrini  @xcite where the number of interior critical points was considered to solution of linear equations .",
    "the maximal open set @xmath103 is formed as follows : for every @xmath15 for which there exists an open neighborhood such that @xmath104 on this neighborhood we denote by @xmath105 , @xmath106 , the maximal open neighborhood of @xmath48 where @xmath9 vanishes identically .",
    "then the maximal open set @xmath103 is simply the union of all such neighborhoods .",
    "we pick a connected component of @xmath103 , still denoted by @xmath103 .",
    "each nodal domain is simply - connected which can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath71 is not simply - connected for some @xmath110 .",
    "then there exists a jordan curve @xmath111 with its interior @xmath112 and @xmath112 contains points which do not belong to the fixed nodal domain @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , @xmath113 since @xmath7 is assumed to be simply - connected .",
    "it follows that the set @xmath114 is non - empty . if @xmath115 was empty , then @xmath116 for all @xmath117 , and @xmath118 for all @xmath119",
    "this is impossible by harnack s inequality , theorem  [ thm : harnack ] .",
    "hence @xmath71 is simply - connected .",
    "we consider next the case in which @xmath120 is non - empty .",
    "it suffices to consider only the points at which @xmath121 ( the points at which @xmath122 are handled in the same way ) ; this set is still denoted by @xmath123 .",
    "the set @xmath124 is open and each component of @xmath124 is a subset of some nodal domain @xmath72 .",
    "this contradicts with the fact that each nodal line meets @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath71 is simply - connected .",
    "an analogous , symmetric , reasoning applies to @xmath72 .",
    "hence @xmath125 and @xmath126 are connected as the boundaries of simply - connected domains , and thus continua , i.e. compact connected sets with at least two points , for each @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "suppose next there exists a point @xmath129 and its neighborhood @xmath130 , @xmath57 , such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 contains only points of either @xmath71 or @xmath72 for some @xmath127 and @xmath128 , i.e. points at which either @xmath122 or @xmath121 .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath132 contains points of @xmath71 only .",
    "then @xmath133 on @xmath130 and by harnack s inequality , theorem  [ thm : harnack ] , @xmath104 on @xmath134 , which contradicts the maximality of the set @xmath103 , and hence also the antithesis ( a ) . in this case",
    "our claim follows .    by the preceding reasoning it is sufficient to consider the following situation . for any @xmath129 and for any @xmath135 , @xmath136",
    ", the neighborhood @xmath137 contains points of the nodal domains @xmath71 and @xmath72 for some indices @xmath127 and for some indices @xmath128 .",
    "we point out that there exist a fixed index pair @xmath138 and @xmath136 such that each @xmath130 contains points of @xmath139 and @xmath140 , but there might be also points of other nodal domains in @xmath130 , for every @xmath135 ; this is a consequence of the fact that the number of nodal domains is finite in our case .",
    "we reason as follows : we consider a point @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath135 .",
    "we then select a decreasing sequence @xmath141 such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 . for each @xmath144",
    "we may pick a pair of nodal domains , which we write @xmath145 such that @xmath146 contains points of both nodal domains . since the number of all possible nodal domain pairs is finite",
    ", there exists a pair which appears infinitely many times in the sequence @xmath147 .",
    "we may hence choose this fixed pair @xmath148 , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 , for some subsequence @xmath151 such that @xmath152 .",
    "it can be seen from this reasoning that the same pair occurs in any neighborhood @xmath130 , @xmath135 .",
    "we shall next base our reasoning on some topological arguments .",
    "we write @xmath153 , @xmath154 and correspondingly @xmath155 . by @xcite accessible boundary points @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 are dense in @xmath159 , @xmath125 , and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "we will describe a selection process which gives a pair of points @xmath161 and @xmath162 such that @xmath163 and that the associated spherical neighborhoods @xmath164 and @xmath165 , @xmath135 , contain points of the same nodal line @xmath166 , @xmath167 fixed .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that @xmath168 , and that @xmath169 .",
    "this procedure is as follows : we select a finite sequence of points @xmath170 , each @xmath171 . as pointed out earlier , for each @xmath172 there",
    "exists @xmath136 such that the spherical neighborhood @xmath130 , @xmath135 , contains points of @xmath139 and @xmath140 for some @xmath167 and @xmath173 .",
    "since the number of all possible nodal domain pairs as described above is finite , after finite number of steps the sequence @xmath170 will contain a pair of points , denoted @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which have the aforementioned properties .",
    "we connect @xmath161 to @xmath162 by a cross - cut @xmath176 in @xmath103 , and @xmath177 to @xmath178 by a cross - cut @xmath179 in @xmath139 .",
    "we remark that @xmath177 , and analogously @xmath178 , is accessible in @xmath139 with a line segment ( consult , e.g. , remark  3.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "also @xmath161 , and analogously @xmath162 , is accessible in @xmath103 with a line segment .",
    "we fix such line segments to access the points @xmath180 , and @xmath178 . in this way",
    "the line segments constitute part of the cross - cut @xmath176 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "since the boundary @xmath166 is connected it is also @xmath47-connected for every @xmath54 .",
    "hence for each @xmath54 the points @xmath161 and @xmath177 can be joined by an @xmath47-chain @xmath181 such that @xmath182 we consider a collection of open balls @xmath183 , @xmath184 , such that @xmath185 , and a domain @xmath186 which is defined to be @xmath187 since @xmath186 is a domain there exists a jordan arc , @xmath188 , connecting @xmath161 to @xmath177 in @xmath186 .",
    "correspondingly , the points @xmath162 and @xmath178 can be joined by an @xmath47-chain in @xmath166 and we obtain a domain @xmath189 and a jordan arc @xmath190 connecting @xmath162 to @xmath178 in @xmath189 .    it is worth noting that we have selected @xmath188 and @xmath190 such that either of them does not intersect @xmath176 or @xmath179 , save the points @xmath161 and @xmath162 , and @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively .",
    "this is possible because of the line segment construction described above .    from the preceding jordan arcs we obtain a jordan curve @xmath191 , and by slight abuse of notation",
    "we write it as a product @xmath192 the jordan curve @xmath191 divides the plane into two disjoint domains , and @xmath191 constitutes the boundary of both domains .",
    "we consider the bounded domain , denoted by @xmath193 , enclosed by @xmath191 .",
    "see figure  [ figure ] .",
    "we next deal with the jordan domain @xmath193 .",
    "there exists at least one point @xmath194 such that @xmath195 , i.e. @xmath196 for some fixed @xmath197 .",
    "assume that this is not the case : then @xmath198 for every @xmath199 .",
    "as @xmath176 is part of the boundary @xmath193 contains also points of @xmath103 , and hence @xmath9 vanishes at such points . by harnack s inequality ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : harnack ] , @xmath104 in @xmath193 .",
    "this is , however , impossible since @xmath179 is part of the boundary of @xmath193 , thus @xmath122 on a sufficiently small neighborhood of a point in @xmath179 .    in an analogous way ,",
    "it is possible to show that there exists a point @xmath200 .",
    "we stress that it is crucial that the selected points @xmath201 and @xmath49 belong to the same nodal domain @xmath202 .",
    "it is worth noting here that by the strong maximum principle @xmath191 can not enclose the nodal domain @xmath202 containing the point @xmath49 , and therefore @xmath203 must also contain points of @xmath202 .",
    "we then connect @xmath201 and @xmath49 in @xmath202 by a jordan arc @xmath204 .",
    "observe that @xmath205 for every @xmath206 .    the jordan arc @xmath204 as a connected set intersects @xmath191 at least at one point .",
    "we then distinguish the following four possible cases for the point of intersection : the point of intersection is contained in        consider the case ( 3 ) and case ( 4 ) .",
    "we denote the point of intersection by @xmath209 for every @xmath54",
    ". we can select an appropriate subsequence @xmath210 , @xmath211 , such that for each @xmath128 either @xmath212 or @xmath213 .",
