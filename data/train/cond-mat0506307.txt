    "unfortunately , deriving _",
    "expressions for pair distribution functions of platelike particles with inhomogeneous charge distributions is still a big challenge .    in conclusion ,",
    "the density - functional theory of charged platelike particles developed here can be regarded as a first step to understand qualitatively free interfaces between isotropic and nematic bulk phases of suspensions of charged platelets and salt . here , we have constructed a density functional for charged platelike particles and applied it to a ternary mixture of platelike macroions and salt ions ( fig .",

    "the two - phase coexistence region is shifted to larger macroion packing fractions . for fixed macroion charge and increasing salt density , the limit of quasi - hard platelets",
    "is approached .",
    "the donnan potential between coexisting phases ( fig .",
