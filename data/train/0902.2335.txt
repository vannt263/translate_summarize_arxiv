    ", we describe the amiba mount , which is the largest operating astronomical hexapod mount .",
    "the role of this paper is to provide additional instrumentation details about this novel hexapod , which complements the science papers .",
    "section [ technical ] introduces the hexapod mount , with more technical details about its components in appendix [ appendix_components ] .",
    "section [ kinematics ] gives an overview of the pointing corrections and the control system .",
    "the explicit pointing model is presented in appendix [ appendix_pointing ] .",
    "photogrammetry measurements and detailed optical pointing tests verify the mount performance , section [ performance ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the design of the amiba mount was driven by the requirement of having a lightweight structure which can easily and quickly be dismantled and shipped to another site for a possible later relocation and the need of having direct access to the receivers on the platform for maintenance .",
    "the targeted science defined the operating frequency ( 86 - 102  ghz ) , and hence the required range of baselines , leading to a 6 m platform .",
    "array configurations with maximum baselines require a pointing accuracy of @xmath4 . based on these considerations a hexapod mount with a cfrp ( carbon fiber reinforced plastic )",
    "platform was chosen .    whereas the concept of the hexapod ( also called stewart platform , @xcite ) is successfully used in many technical applications like machine tools , flight simulations or complex orthopedic surgery , its application in astronomy has so far been mostly limited to secondary mirrors for classical cassegrain telescopes , where the hexapod is used for focus optimization or wobbling movements to cancel the atmosphere and receiver noise .",
    "a pioneering design of a 1.5 m hexapod telescope for optical astronomy was presented in @xcite . besides this , the amiba is the only operating hexapod telescope .",
    "the six independently actuated legs give the stewart platform six degrees of freedom ( x , y , z , pitch , roll and yaw ) , where the lengths of the legs are changed to orient and position the platform .",
    "this parallel kinematics system has advantages and disadvantages compared to a serial kinematics system .",
    "there is no accumulation of position errors and a generally lower inertia allows for faster accelerations and slewing velocities .",
    "the lower mass , however brings some risk for oscillations .",
    "the control system for the six legs is more complex , because of more degrees of freedom in motions which can compete and interfere with each other .    for astronomical applications the hexapod offers some interesting possibilities : no elevation counterweights and no azimuth bearing",
    "are needed and there is no zenith keyhole compared to a conventional mount .",
    "access to the receivers and correlator from beneath the platform is straightforward",
    ". the sky field rotation ( see appendix [ appendix_angle ] ) can be compensated , and polarization measurements are possible by rotating the entire platform .    the amiba hexapod with its local control system was designed and fabricated by vertex antennentechnik gmbh , duisburg , germany . after a factory acceptance test in 2004 in germany , the whole telescope was dismantled , shipped to hilo , hawaii and assembled again on the mauna loa site with a final on - site acceptance test in october 2005 .",
    "the key components in the vertex design are : the upper and lower universal joints ( u - joints ) with jack screws , which require high stiffness and large travel ranges ; the stiffness of the support cone , to minimize pointing errors from the cone ; and the pointing error model required to meet the @xmath5 pointing requirement .",
    "the amiba hexapod has a lower limit of 30@xmath6 in elevation .",
    "azimuth movement is unlimited without interruption .",
    "the hexapod platform polarization ( @xmath7 ) range is limited to @xmath8 , with the polarization rotation defined around the pointing axis at any possible mount position .",
    "both limits are chosen for safety reasons based on structural concerns .",
    "mechanical hard limit switches are in place to prevent movement beyond these limits in case of software failure and overriding .",
    "the maximum slewing speed is 0.67@xmath6/s .",
    "the telescope is designed to meet the harsh environmental conditions on mauna loa , allowing us to operate with wind speeds of up to 30 m / s ( for survival in stow position , wind speeds of up to 65",
    "m / s can be tolerated ) and an operating temperature range of @xmath9c to @xmath10c ( in stow position : @xmath11c to @xmath10c ) .",
    "earthquake survival conditions are met with 0.3 g for both horizontal and vertical accelerations .",
    "the total weight of the mount is @xmath3 31,800 kg .",
    "( support cone @xmath3 16,600 kg , jack screws @xmath3 6,000 kg , universal joints @xmath3 9,200 kg . ) the platform with the interface ring adds another @xmath3 3,000 kg .",
    "the current load for the 7 element system is @xmath3 500 kg .",
    "the hexapod mount system , schematically illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , mainly consists of a support cone , 6 identical jack screw assemblies with gearboxes , drives and measuring systems , 12 u - joints in total and a cfrp platform .",
    "more technical details about these components are given in appendix [ appendix_components ] .",
    "observations are started with extended jacks from a neutral position , figure [ fig2 ] right panel .",
    "the free access to receivers and correlator is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the hexapod topology is optimized with respect to minimized travel ranges of the u - joints and to minimized jack screw loads . since the hexapod position",
    "is entirely determined by the variable length of the 6 jack screws together with the positions of the 6 lower fixed u - joints , utmost care needs to be taken to accurately monitor the jack screw lengths .",
    "the positions of the 6 lower fixed u - joints have been measured with a laser ranging system in the vertex factory in germany .",
    "the first group of pointing corrections on jack level consist of 4 compensations : jack screw pitch error , temperature compensation , jack screw rotation error and support cone correction .",
    "they all directly yield a length correction for each individual jack at any given mount position .",
    "these error compensations have been tested and calibrated in the vertex factory , and the correction algorithms are integrated into the hexapod control system . besides the group of jack screw corrections , a second group of telescope pointing corrections is implemented : radio and optical refraction , an optical telescope ( ot ) collimation error correction and an interpolation table ( it ) for residual errors . only the latter two ones need to be measured , updated and handled by the operator .",
    "this second group leads to corrections in azimuth and elevation , which are then translated into jack corrections .",
    "a detailed description of the pointing error model is in appendix [ appendix_pointing ] .    for radio observations",
    "the ot collimation error correction is deactivated in the pointing error model .",
    "this assumes that the offsets derived from the optical pointing ( with ot collimation correction , optical refraction and all other corrections activated ) are identical to the errors for the radio pointing ( no collimation error correction , radio refraction and all other corrections activated ) .",
    "in fact , the resolution and the collecting total power of the 0.6 m diameter antennas are not sufficient to do a separate radio pointing .",
    "however , we use the correlated signal to verify the relative radio alignment between individual antennas .",
    "we remark that we do not derive explicit corrections for the platform polarization because the polarization stability and precision have been found to be around @xmath12 or better which is good enough for our purposes . we , however , derive azimuth and elevation pointing corrections for various platform polarizations ( section [ pointing_pol ] ) .    the main drive control and",
    "the jack length calculations for a commanded position are done by the acu ( antenna control unit ) .",
    "this also includes the inverse backward transformation giving the telescope position based on a set of jack lengths .",
    "this is essential for the continuous check between requested and actual telescope position , which is done in a closed loop system every 5ms and updated depending on the operation .",
    "the above mentioned pointing corrections are calculated on the ptc ( pointing computer ) where they can be individually activated and displayed .",
    "from here they are transferred to the acu , illustrated in the flow chart in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the block diagram in figure [ fig6 ] summarizes the control system .",
    "the actual position , defined as the real position after applying all the pointing corrections , is displayed on acu and reported to the remote tcs ( telescope control system ) .",
    "a redundant independent safety level is provided by the hpc ( hexapod computer ) with its plc ( programmable logic controller ) .",
    "the hpc calculates the telescope position from the jack positions as measured by the safety ( auxiliary ) encoders .",
    "the plc is responsible for safety interlocks from limit switches .",
    "time synchronization is derived from a stratum-1 gps server , connected to the acu with an irig - b time signal .",
    "communication between individual computers is through standard lan ethernet cables with tcp / ip protocol and ntp for time synchronization , and it is rs232 and/or canbus where analog components are involved .",
    "the telescope main operating modes include : _ preset , startrack _ and _ progtrack _ , with the latter only possible in remote mode from tcs .",
    "_ preset _ moves the telescope to a defined position in @xmath13 on a geodesic path , ensuring a short and fast connection between subsequent mount positions .",
    "_ startrack _ tracks a celestial object with either @xmath7=constant or @xmath14=constant .",
    "_ progtrack _ drives the telescope on a defined trajectory in @xmath15 with a spline interpolation and a maximum stack of 2000 data points .",
    "this mode is extensively used for various types of observation and system checks .",
    "in the initial amiba operational phase seven close - packed 0.6 m diameter cassegrain antennas @xcite are used on baselines separated by 0.6 m , 1.04 m and 1.2 m .",
    "the antenna field of view ( fwhp @xmath16 ) and the synthesized beam ( @xmath17 ) of the array in this configuration ( at the observing frequency band 86 - 102  ghz ) set the specifications on the platform deformation and the pointing and tracking accuracy , which are : @xmath18 rms pointing error and a platform z - direction deformation of less than 0.3 mm .",
    "prior to the integration of the platform and the hexapod in germany for the factory acceptance test , we performed stiffness measurements of the cfrp platform on the ground under expected loading conditions .",
    "these measurements were repeated at the mauna loa site .",
    "both measurements showed that the deformations were larger than expected and predicted by fea ( finite element analysis ) , especially towards the outer edge of the platform , even after reinforcement was added .",
    "the cause is the segmented structure of the platform , coupled with inaccurate modeling of stiffness across the segment joints .",
    "it was decided to use the photogrammetry method to verify the platform deformations in a real 7-element compact configuration on the hexapod .",
    "the first photogrammetry campaign took place during the fall of 2005 , with dummy weights to replace receivers and electronic boxes . in october 2006",
    ", we repeated the photogrammetry measurements , this time on the operational 7-element telescope .",
    "the results of the second survey are consistent with the 2005 results . in 2006",
    ", we achieved a better measuring accuracy : about 30@xmath19 m rms in @xmath20 ( defined as normal to the platform ) , with a short term ( 1 - 2 days ) and a long term ( 1 week ) repeatability better than 80@xmath19 m rms .",
    "we used a geodetic services , inc .",
    "( gsi of melbourne , florida ) inca2 single digital photogrammetric camera .",
    "the pictures were processed with a gsi v - stars 3d industrial measuring system .",
    "about 500 retro - reflective , self - adhesive targets ( 12 mm diameter , @xmath3 0.1 mm thick ) were distributed over the entire platform surface with a higher target density around receivers .",
    "50 platform positions over the entire azimuth , elevation and platform polarization range were surveyed .",
    "the analysis of the photogrammetry measurements @xcite reveals a saddle - shaped platform deformation pattern at all surveyed positions , illustrated in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the amplitude and phase of this saddle are functions of azimuth , elevation and polarization .",
    "the specifications are met for the 7 antennas in the compact configuration , with a @xmath20-deformation amplitude up to 0.120  mm in the inner part of the platform . at the location of the optical telescope ( ot ) , the maximum amplitude ( measured at 30@xmath6 elevation and 20@xmath6 polarization ) is about 0.38 mm ( figure [ fig12 ] ) , which leads to an ot tilt movement with respect to the normal pointing axis of the mount of about @xmath21 in this extreme position . a more average position @xmath13=(0,60,0 )",
    "is also illustrated for comparison , showing an amplitude of about 0.11 mm , which leads to a corresponding ot tilt of about @xmath22 . as argued in section [ pointing ] , this uncompensated pointing error is acceptable for the 7-element compact configuration , but will need to be corrected for the planned expansion phase with 13 elements .    a detailed analysis and model of the saddle type deformation for a 13-element radio phase correction and an error separation between deformation and pointing error is presented in @xcite . for this refined analysis we installed a second ot on the platform . by simply taking the difference between the two data sets of the two ots , a characteristic signature appears which can be clearly attributed to the platform deformation . using a saddle type model as an input for the deformation , the mount pointing error can be successfully separated .",
    "similarly , with the help of an interpolation scheme based on the entire photogrammetry data set , the radio phase error from the platform deformation can be reduced from a maximum @xmath23 m rms over the entire platform to @xmath24 m or less . the synthesized beam area",
    "is then maintained to within 10% of its non - deforming ideal value . in this way ,",
    "the specifications are also met for the 13-element expansion .",
    "pointing with a hexapod telescope is different from a conventional telescope where a 7- or 13-parameter pointing error model is often used . an important consequence of the hexapod mount is the absence of azimuth and elevation encoders as compared to more traditional telescopes .",
    "the 3-dimensional locations of the upper and lower u - joints in the measured reference positions and the jack lengths in any position completely define the geometry of the mount .",
    "the pointing error model therefore needs to take utmost care in treating the jack lengths and the lower u - joint positions .",
    "the 6 upper u - joint locations define a best - fit plane with its normal defining the resulting pointing axis .",
    "optical pointing is carried out with a celestron c8 telescope , equipped with a fastar f/1.95 adapter lens and a sbig st-237 ccd camera .",
    "the resulting field of view ( fov ) is about @xmath25 on a 652 @xmath26 495 pixel array , giving a calibrated pixel scale of about @xmath27 .",
    "a preliminary rough ot collimation error is measured on the platform with a digital tiltmeter and compensated in the pointing error model , following equation  ( [ collimation1 ] ) and ( [ collimation2 ] ) .      in order to achieve the required pointing accuracy of @xmath28 or better ,",
    "a two - step approach is adopted . in a first pointing run",
    "all the known pointing corrections ( section [ kinematics ] ) except the interpolation table ( it ) are activated on the pointing computer ( ptc ) . as a function of the mount position , @xmath29 , the offsets @xmath30 , @xmath31 of a target star @xmath32 , with respect to the center of the ccd image ,",
    "are split into an @xmath33 and @xmath34 error in a common reference frame at @xmath35 .",
    "this involves rotating the ccd images by the mount @xmath33 ( and @xmath7 ) coordinate , together with an additional rotation @xmath36 for the orientation of the ccd with respect to the sky .",
    "this yields the ccd frame - mount frame transformation ( figure [ fig7 ] ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 for each star image @xmath32 at the mount position @xmath32 .",
    "the raw errors @xmath39 are then analyzed to separate the remaining uncompensated ot collimation error from the real mount pointing error .",
    "@xmath40 has a characteristic azimuth and elevation signature of the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the ot uncompensated tilt amplitude and phase , respectively , which reflect the remaining ot collimation error and @xmath44 are two constants . assuming a rigid ot , the amplitude @xmath42 is identical for the azimuth and elevation signature and their phases are separated by @xmath45 .",
    "the small fitting residuals @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( of the order of @xmath48 or less ) populate the it , which is a three - dimensional table in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath7 : @xmath49    the irregular grid errors ( @xmath50 ) are then transformed into a regular spaced grid with the cubic shepard algorithm @xcite , finally generating the it pointing corrections ( @xmath51 ) .    in a second pointing run all the known pointing corrections and",
    "the it are activated on the ptc .",
    "this verifies that the mount errors are reduced with the it and that only the ot collimation error remains .",
    "these small errors are checked every few weeks for their repeatability .",
    "typically , one it iteration is needed to reduce an initial pointing error in @xmath33 and @xmath34 from @xmath52 rms to about @xmath53 rms .",
    "subsequent pointing tests have revealed almost exactly the same numbers ( within repeatability , section [ repeatability ] ) , so that our it has been unchanged over the year of data - taking .",
    "the iterative improvement with the it is illustrated in figure [ fig13 ] , where the total raw error , @xmath54 , is shown in a polar plot over the entire azimuth range . in this strategy",
    "it is crucial to identify properly the remaining uncompensated ot collimation error ( @xmath55 ) to make sure that the small remaining values in the interpolation table compensate only and exclusively for the hexapod mount errors . for radio observations",
    "the ot collimation error correction is deactivated in the pointing error model .",
    "this assumes that the pointing errors derived from the optical pointing ( with ot collimation correction , optical refraction and all other corrections activated ) are identical to the errors for the radio pointing ( no collimation error correction , radio refraction and all other corrections activated ) .",
    "no separate radio pointing is done because the 0.6 m antennas ( fwhm @xmath16 ) do not have enough gain to allow us to verify the required pointing accuracy . in order to have the most rigid measure ,",
    "the ot is installed close to one of the upper u - joint positions .",
    "possible local irregularities and position - dependent platform deformations which can affect the rigidity of the ot need to be filtered out if the pointing needs to be further improved @xcite .",
    "the interpolation table approach further assumes that the remaining mount errors are sufficiently smooth enough functions in between neighboring pointings , leading to the question of the optimized pointing cell size .",
    "we find that 100 stars , approximately evenly distributed in solid angle over the entire accessible sky , resolve the pointing features reasonably well .",
    "observing more stars does not significantly improve the pointing .",
    "typically , we need about 1 hour to observe 100 stars in a fully automatic mode , where the telescope is driven from high to low elevation on a spiraling trajectory .",
    "a multiple of this time is required if different platform polarizations for each star are included .",
    "although not necessary in the interpolation table approach , we found it useful to further analyze the residuals and identify their origins . a more detailed fitting including",
    "the mount tilt : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a term taking into account an additional mount tilt , improved the goodness of the fit only marginally , but still revealed a mount cone / foundation tilt of @xmath4 with respect to zenith .",
    "furthermore , our control software allows us to simulate a small rotation of the entire telescope . in this way we identified a slight misorientation of the cone with respect to north of @xmath52 .",
    "these effects contribute partly to the constants @xmath44 in equation  ( [ eq_ot ] ) .",
    "since both errors are small , we simply absorb them in the it .      extracting the polarization corrections",
    "relies on the proper identification of the ot signature .",
    "this is best done at @xmath59 , since at @xmath60 the polarization error and the ot signature become degenerate .",
    "the @xmath7 movement is illustrated in figure [ fig16 ] .",
    "for the ot itself , the @xmath60 case is only an additional rotation , identical to an azimuth position with @xmath61 , as described in equation  ( [ ot_equation ] ) .",
    "we are thus extracting the ot signature at @xmath59 assuming it to be rigid enough , so that any position error with a polarized platform , as a function of ( @xmath62 ) , becomes : @xmath63 where @xmath39 are again defined as in equation  ( [ ot_equation ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath64 are the ot signatures shifted by @xmath65 , @xmath66 in equation([eq_ot ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig17 ] for the raw elevation errors , where polarization pointing was done with @xmath7=@xmath67 for 100 stars .",
    "clearly seen is the ot signature with the @xmath59 case shifted to the different @xmath7 angles .",
    "the residual polarization errors increase linearly with the polarization angle , from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for @xmath70 to @xmath71 , as shown in figure [ fig18 ] for the polarization dependent elevation error .",
    "we remark that we do not explicitly correct for a polarization error .",
    "we found that the uncertainty in the polarization angle is within @xmath12 or better , which is negligible for the later pointing error analysis and our observations .",
    "we finally consider the influence of the platform deformation ( section [ photogrammetry ] ) on the pointing error analysis .",
    "the local saddle - type deformation with a z - direction amplitude of typically @xmath72 m at the ot radius will slightly change the ot s phase and amplitude as a function of the mount position , and therefore introduce a local position dependent error which is under-/overcompensated in the it .",
    "however , a @xmath72 m amplitude leads to an estimated wiggling of the ot of about @xmath22 . for the 7-element compact configuration we consider that acceptable and we therefore have not further extracted this component .      a key parameter to ensure the reliability of the entire system is the pointing repeatability .",
    "factory tests have revealed short term repeatability errors between @xmath73 and @xmath74 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "two astronomical tests with the ot were performed : first , in an overall repeatability test , two runs with 250 stars ( distributed on equal solid angles over the complete accessible celestial sphere ) were executed during the same night , the 2nd run immediately after the 1st one , with almost identical atmospheric conditions .",
    "secondly , in a star position test , aiming at the day - to - day repeatability , a set of 8 stars in different directions and elevations was observed on two subsequent days at the same time .",
    "ccd images were then taken by going back and forth between two stars of this set .",
    "some stars could be observed at almost exactly the same time at almost identical mount positions .",
    "both tests show consistent results : a cell - to - cell comparison from the overall repeatability test gives an average @xmath33 and @xmath34 error difference of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the star position tests show a day - to - day repeatability better than @xmath77 . from the same test",
    "it could also be verified that small changes in the mount position introduce only small linear deviations in the pointing and tracking errors .",
    "the long term repeatability has been checked on a roughly weekly basis in the early mount testing phase .",
    "later , with each additional receiver element integrated into the array , pointing tests have been routinely carried out .",
    "all these results are consistent within the short term repeatability errors . over the more than two years operation of the 7-element compact configuration ,",
    "a very robust pointing performance was verified , with no measurable changes due to temperature or other environmental effects , or additional weight on the platform .",
    "tracking tests were performed over short time periods , typically about 30 minutes .",
    "this ensures that tracking results are not or only minimally biased by any uncompensated pointing errors .",
    "30-minute tests mean that pointing stars remain within a single it cell .",
    "the tracking tests were done in both polarization modes , @xmath7=constant and @xmath14=constant.=constant : a celestial object is tracked by keeping the intrinsic platform polarization constant . in this mode , any possible complication from the additional polarization movement is avoided , making it a clean measure of tracking performance . in order to separate the tracking and pointing errors ,",
    "tracking is done only over a short time ( small angular range ) , where the pointing error is supposed not to change significantly .",
    "longer tracking tests require the use of the it .",
    "+ @xmath14=constant : a celestial object is tracked by fixing a polarization on the sky , introducing therefore a counter - rotation of the hexapod to compensate for the sky rotation .",
    "this checks the tracking stability of the mount .",
    "constant @xmath14 mode is essential for polarization measurement and control of baseline orientations .",
    "we test this mode by monitoring the orientation of a vector between two stars .",
    "] in the @xmath7=constant mode , a linearly increasing tracking error was measured over 30 minutes , accumulating to @xmath78 after 30 minutes in figure [ fig28 ] .",
    "the @xmath14=constant mode shows a field rotation stability of about @xmath79 rms with respect to an initial polarization direction over 30  minutes , figure [ fig29 ] .",
    "since tracking is internally handled as a fast sequence of pointing positions , the long - term tracking error ( several hours or large ranges in @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath7 ) is controlled by all the pointing corrections including the it . on short timescales ( within interpolated errors in the it )",
    "the measured tracking error reflects a combination of partially uncompensated pointing errors and tracking - specific errors .",
    "our normal observations @xcite are carried out in a lead / trail - main field procedure over about 6  minutes .",
    "the tracking error is therefore negligible .",
    "based on the measured pointing accuracy we quantify the array efficiency . besides this absolute mount pointing error @xmath80 , which misaligns each antenna by the same amount , we also take into account the measured platform deformation error @xmath81 and a radio misalignment error @xmath82 for each antenna pair ( baseline ) . @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 define a relative error which measures the shift in the overlap of two antenna primary beams .",
    "additionally , they can also alter the absolute pointing error of each antenna , worsening or improving it due to the local pseudo - random character of the errors .",
    "this resultant total pointing error defines the loss in the synthesized beam product @xcite . due to the complicated position dependence of all these errors",
    ", we use a monte - carlo simulation ( 10,000 realizations ) to quantify the loss .",
    "we assume uniformly distributed errors : @xmath85^{\\prime}$ ] , @xmath86^{\\prime}$ ] , @xmath87^{\\prime}$ ] .",
    "the error interval for @xmath83 is a conservative estimate from the photogrammetry results , @xmath84 corresponds to @xmath88 of the antenna fwhp , which is approximately the achievable mechanical alignment limit .",
    "the expected efficiency is about 93% . with @xmath89^{\\prime}$ ]",
    "the efficiency drops to about 90% .",
    "the hexapod design has some interesting advantages compared to a conventional mount . from an engineering point of view",
    ", it offers a relatively compact design for transportation and possible relocation , a simple cable wrap and ease of access to the receivers from beneath the platform , which is important for daily maintenance and easy reconfiguration of the baselines . for its astronomical application",
    ", there is no zenith keyhole , polarization movements are controlled by the same algorithm actuating all six jack lengths and no additional mechanical polarization axis is needed as in the case of the cbi telescope @xcite .",
    "compromises have to be made , leading to a reduced elevation and polarization range of 30@xmath6 and @xmath8 , respectively . whereas the hexapod offers six degrees of freedom , for its traditional astronomical application only three degrees are used . the amiba hexapod is essentially driven along geodesics on a sphere , both for tracking and slewing .",
    "tracking is approximated as a sequence of multiple segments of great circles .",
    "direct and even shorter travel ranges for slewing , following simple translational movements on a straight line , have not been implemented for safety reasons .",
    "the hexapod however offers additionally the possibility of small movements along the pointing directions if this should be of astronomical interest .",
    "pointing with a hexapod is very different from a conventional mount .",
    "position errors are not accumulated as in a serial kinematics system , but the control system is significantly more complex .",
    "utmost care needs to be taken to determine all the jack lengths accurately . with one it iteration",
    "the current pointing accuracy is @xmath53 rms in azimuth and elevation , which meets the requirements for the 7-element array compact configuration baselines .",
    "an uncompensated pointing error from the platform deformation of the order @xmath90 still keeps it in an acceptable range , but needs to be further analyzed for the planned expansion phase .",

    "was done in order to optimize a low structural weight and minimize the pointing error contribution .",
    "simulated load cases included gravity , 10 m / s side wind , 10 m / s front wind , a temperature gradient along the cone axis with @xmath91=1k and a temperature difference between the steel cone and the concrete foundation with @xmath91=2k . in order to separate the pointing error contribution of the support cone from the rest of the telescope ,",
