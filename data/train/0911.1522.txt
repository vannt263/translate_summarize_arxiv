    "the measurement of the charmonium ( j/@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) resonances in nucleus - nucleus collisions is considered to be one of the most powerful methods to probe the nature of the high density qcd matter .",
    "first , the in - medium behavior of quarkonium is supposed to be one of the most direct probes of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation  @xcite . it was predicted that in a deconfined medium , the debye screening of the colour potential leads to the melting of quarkonium states and",
    "thus provides an estimate of the medium temperature .",
    "second , at lhc energies heavy quarks are produced mainly through gluon - gluon fusion process thus they are significantly affected by parton dynamics in the low-@xmath2 regime .",
    "therefore , they can be used as a tool to probe the saturation of the gluon density at low-@xmath2 in the nucleus and the color glass condensate formation  @xcite .",
    "+ the lhc ( large hadron collider ) will provide , at nominal operating conditions , pb+pb collisions at @xmath3  =  5.5 tev allowing the study of the quarkonium production in an unprecedented energy regime .",
    "the lhc will deliver p+p and p+pb collisions at @xmath3  =  14 and 8.8  tev respectively providing a solid baseline for the pb+pb system .",
    "the j/@xmath0 yields ( normalized to the drell - yan process ) were measured at the cern sps for different colliding systems and energies : from p+p to various p+nucleus ( p+a ) with proton energy of 450  gev .",
    "moreover , nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions , from o+u and s+u ( na38 ) with a projectile energy of 200  gev per nucleon to pb+pb and in+in ( na50 and na60 ) with a projectile energy of 158  gev per nucleon have been studied . +",
    "it was observed that p+p , p+a and peripheral a+a data show an exponential suppression of the j/@xmath0 to drell - yan ratio when plotted as a function of the average length of nuclear matter traversed by the @xmath4 pair .",
    "this behavior was interpreted in terms of the normal nuclear absorption ( normal suppression ) of the @xmath4 pair prior to the j/@xmath0 formation with a corresponding absorption cross section of 4.18  @xmath5  0.35  mb  @xcite . for more central a+a collisions ( in+in and pb+pb ) an additional suppression ( anomalous suppression )",
    "was seen  @xcite .",
    "this result was interpreted as a consequence of the creation of the deconfined medium .",
    "+ one can thus think that the j/@xmath0 behaves as a predicted golden signature of the qgp formation .",
    "the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) measured the j/@xmath0 production in a+a ( au+au ) collisions at @xmath3  =  200  gev .",
    "the j/@xmath0 behavior was studied via the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 defined as following : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the j/@xmath0 yield in au+au collisions , @xmath9 the corresponding mean number of binary collisions and @xmath10 the yield in p+p collisions .",
    "the phenix results brought up two surprises  @xcite :    * if plotted @xmath6 as a function of the number of participants @xmath11 : at midrapidity the amount of suppression at rhic is similar to the suppression observed at sps .",
    "@xmath12 were expected , as predicted in the color screening mechanism , to be more suppressed at rhic because of the higher energy density reached at collider energies . *",
    "if plotted @xmath6 as a function of the number of participants @xmath11 for different rapidity domains : @xmath12 are more suppressed at forward rapidity where the energy density is lower than at midrapidity .",
    "+ two possible reasons for theses results are explored and discussed .",
    "firstly , the abundant production of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks at midrapidity domain can lead to their recombination  @xcite and @xmath12 creation from initially uncorrelated quarks .",
    "secondly , the nuclear effects like standard gluon shadowing that are important at forward rapidity domain have to be taken into account .",
    "also the saturation effects ( color glass condensate ) could lead to the observed j/@xmath0 behavior .",
    "+ for the moment , both interpretations are possible .",
    "there is not enough experimental data to exclude one of them and to draw a definite conclusion .",
    "the lhc collider will open up new perspectives in the study of the quarkonium of qcd .",
    "one can ask what is different at the lhc in comparison with rhic or sps .",
    "first of all , an unprecedented collision energy will be reached ( @xmath1528 times bigger than at rhic ) .",
    "secondly , the lhc will allow to access an unexplored bjorken-@xmath2 region and thus probe the low-@xmath2 qcd phenomena ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "finally , the expected copious production of heavy quarks should help us to bring down the curtain on the different predicted j/@xmath0 behaviors ( suppression , regeneration or both simultaneously ) .",
    "+ there are several experimental challenges for quarkonium measurements at the lhc : a ) the choice of the reference production process for the normalization ; b ) estimation of the j/@xmath0 contribution originated from b - meson decays ; c ) understanding the complex combinatorial background very well and d ) taking into account possible heavy quark energy loss .",
    "+ these topics are under investigation as they are crucial points needed to understand quarkonium production at the lhc .",
    "alice ( a large ion collider experiment )  @xcite experiment is dedicated to the study of heavy ion collisions .",
    "its goal is to study the properties of deconfined matter : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the alice detector is composed of a central barrel system ( @xmath170.9 ) , a muon spectrometer ( -4.0@xmath18 - 2.5 ) and several small additional detectors .",
    "quarkonium will be measured in alice via two channels : the dielectron channel at midrapidity and the dimuon channel at forward rapidity . + the measurement via dielectron channel is provided by the combination of several detectors that are here described , as seen by a particle travelling out from the interaction point :    * inner tracking system ( its )  @xcite allows the reconstruction of the primary vertex , secondary vertex finding , and particle identification via @xmath19 .",
    "this detector is composed of three subsystems of two layers each : the silicon pixel detector , the silicon drift detector and the silicon strip detector .",
    "* time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite allows track finding , momentum measurement , and charged hadron identification via @xmath19 .",
    "tpc has an inner radius of 0.9 m , an outer radius of 2.5 m and a length of 5.1 m. the momentum resolution for the track reconstruction , including tpc and its information , is expected to be better than 2% for p@xmath20  @xmath21  20  gev / c .",
    "* transition radiation detector ( trd )  @xcite allows electron identification and also provides fast triggering .",
    "electron identification is provided by the trd for momenta larger than 1  gev / c .",
    "this detector is made of 18 longitudinal supermodules , 6 radial layers , and 5 stacks along the beam axis .",
    "the invariant mass resolution for the quarkonium was studied in the full simulation for pb+pb collisions .",
    "the reconstructed peaks were fitted by a gaussian and the invariant mass resolution for the j/@xmath0 is found to be 30  mev / c@xmath22 .",
    "the analysis showed that the j/@xmath0 signal can be reconstructed up to p@xmath20  =  10  gev / c .",
    "+ the detection via dimuon channel in the forward rapidity region is provided by the muon spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "this detector is composed of a set of absorbers : a front absorber , a muon filter , a beam shielding and an absorber against the lhc background .",
    "the goal of these absorbers is to suppress hadron and electron background .",
    "the tracking system allowing the muon trajectory reconstruction contains five tracking stations .",
    "the dipole magnet with a field integral of 3 tm along the beam axis provides the bending power to measure the momenta of the muons .",
    "two trigger stations provide a fast electronic signal for the trigger selection of muon events .",
    "the p@xmath20 cut of 1  gev / c applied to single muons allows charmonia detection down to zero transverse momenta . the invariant mass resolution for the j/@xmath0 in pb+pb collisions",
    "is expected to be around 70  mev / c@xmath22 .",
    "the high - p@xmath20 reach for the j/@xmath0 is expected to be around 20  gev / c .",
    "+   + in addition to direct j/@xmath0 also those from b decays ( secondary j/@xmath0 ) have to be taken into account .",
    "the contribution of secondary j/@xmath0 to the total j/@xmath0 yields is about 20  % . to separate the prompt j/@xmath0 s from the secondary ones , the measure of dielectron pairs with displaced vertex",
    "must be performed .",
    "in fact , the secondary j/@xmath0 are produced at large distances ( several hundred of microns ) from the primary vertex .",
    "the its vertexing capabilities allow to perform this study in the central barrel .",
    "this analysis is not possible in the forward rapidity region because the muon spectrometer does not provide vertexing capabilities . +   +",
    "the suppression of j/@xmath0 was studied in the dimuon channel .",
    "two extreme suppression scenarios were considered .",
    "the first one characterized by a high critical deconfinement temperature at t@xmath23  =  270  mev  @xcite and the second one using t@xmath23  =  190  mev  @xcite . to check the detector capability for distinguishing between different suppression scenarios",
    "the ratios of the resonance rates over those for beauty as a function of the number of participants were studied .",
    "it was seen that the error bars for the j/@xmath0 to open beauty ratio are small enough to distinguish between these two suppression scenarios .",
    "+   + to distinguish between different quarkonia production mechanisms the quarkonia polarization study must be performed .",
    "the angular distribution of the decay products ( dielectrons or dimuons ) in the quarkonia rest frame allows to reconstruct the polarization .",
    "it has been predicted that the qgp formation may change the quarkonia polarization .",
    "in fact an increase of j/@xmath0 polarization is expected in this case  @xcite .",
    "the primary physics goal of the atlas experiment  @xcite is the search of the higgs boson and susy particles ( supersymmetry ) .",
    "nevertheless , other physics sectors like cp violation and rare b - decays , can be explored .",
    "atlas will be able to provide evidence of physics phenomena beyond the standard model ( sm ) in p+p collisions at @xmath3  =  14  tev .",
    "+ the atlas detector consists of four major components : inner tracking system ( @xmath172.5 ) , calorimeters ( electromagnetic : @xmath173.2 , hadronic barrel : @xmath171.7 , hadronic end - cap : 1.5@xmath243.2 and forward : 3.1@xmath244.9 ) , muon spectrometer ( @xmath172.5 ) and forward detectors ( lucid : 5.3@xmath246 , zdc : @xmath178.3 and alfa ) .",
    "+ atlas can detect the j/@xmath0 in the dimuon channel using the muon spectrometer covering @xmath172.7 and full azimuth .",

    "the trigger system covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath25 2.4 .",
    "resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) are used in the barrel and thin gap chambers ( tgcs ) in the end - cap regions .",
    "the magnetic bending is provided by the large barrel toroid with a magnetic field of 0.5  -  1  t. the strong magnetic field and the large material budget of the inner detector and calorimeters make difficult the reconstruction of the muons with a @xmath26  3  gev / c .",
    "the minimum dimuon trigger threshold is around 4  gev / c .",
    "the invariant mass resolution for j/@xmath0 is expected to be around 54  mev / c@xmath22 and 68  mev / c@xmath22 respectively in p+p and pb+pb collisions .",
    "the cms experiment  @xcite is dedicated to explore physics at the tev scale .",
    "the prime goals of cms are to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide evidence of physics beyond sm .",
    "cms will also study a large amount of signatures arising in the sm : qcd , b - physics , diffraction , top quark properties , and electroweak physics topics such as the w and z boson properties . + the cms detector is composed of : inner tracking system ( @xmath172.5 ) , calorimeters ( electromagnetic : @xmath173 , hadronic : @xmath175 ) , muon system and few forwards detectors ( castor : 5@xmath246.6 and zdc : @xmath278.3 ) . in this experiment , the j/@xmath0 are detected via their @xmath28 decay by the muon system ( @xmath172.4 ) that is divided into a central part ( barrel detector : @xmath171.2 ) and forward parts ( endcap detector : @xmath172.4 ) .",
    "the barrel detector comprises the drift tubes chambers and resistive plates chambers .",
    "the forward parts are composed of a set of cathode strip chambers in the 2 muon endcaps and a layers of resistive plates chambers .",

    "the cms will also perform the polarization study of the quarkonium states .",
    "+      the main goal of the lhcb  @xcite experiment is to study cp violation in the b meson systems and to search for rare b decays .",
    "the lhcb apparatus is a single arm forward spectrometer with a polar angular coverage from 15 to 300 mrad in the horizontal and 250 mrad in the vertical plane .",
    "this corresponds to a pseudorapidity range 2@xmath185 .",
    "the choice of the detector geometry is motivated by the fact that at high energies b hadrons are predominately produced in the forward region .",
    "this detector is composed of a vertex detector system ( velo ) , a tracking system , aerogel and gas rich counters ( cherenkov detectors ) , an electromagnetic calorimeter with preshower detector , a hadron calorimeter and a muon detector .",
    "+ the measurement of quarkonium will be performed in p+p collisions via j/@xmath29 .",
    "in fact , j/@xmath0 candidates are reconstructed by combining pairs of oppositely charged tracks that originate from a common vertex .",
    "the muon trigger system requires a muon with a p@xmath30  1  gev / c and one of the tracks with p@xmath30  1.5  gev / c .",
    "both tracks have to be identified as muons .",
    "in addition , one of the tracks is needed to be identified by cutting hard on likelihood of the muon hypothesis relative to the pion  @xcite .",
    "the expected mass resolution is around 11  mev / c@xmath22 .",
    "+ the lhcb detector will be able to separate prompt j/@xmath0 s from those from @xmath31 decays using the @xmath32 variable defined as following : @xmath33 this variable is an approximation of the proper time of the @xmath31 quark in the forward region .",
    "this distribution contains four components : a prompt component due to the j/@xmath0 originating from the primary vertex ( gaussian distribution ) , an exponential component due to the j/@xmath0 coming from @xmath31 decays , a combinatorial component due to particles coming from the primary vertex and a long tail component due to the association of the j/@xmath0 to the wrong primary vertex .",
    "+ moreover , the lhcb will measure the feed down from decays of @xmath34 to the prompt j/@xmath0 and the j/@xmath0 polarization .",
