    "in sum , we sketched and explored the implications of berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) critical behavior on the quantum critical properties of a two dimensional ( 2d ) quantum superconductor - insulator transition ( qsi ) driven by the tuning parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that the finite temperature bkt scenario , implies in terms of the characteristic temperature dependence of the bkt correlation length an explicit quantum scaling function for the sheet resistance @xmath266 along the superconducting branch ending at the nonuniversal critical value @xmath50 .",
    "this scaling form fixes the bkt - transition line @xmath109 and provides estimates for the quantum critical exponent product @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , independent estimates of @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 follow from the @xmath0 dependence of the nonuniversal parameters @xmath81 and @xmath37 entering the characteristic bkt expression for the sheet resistance @xmath1 .",
    "this requires that the bkt critical regime where phase fluctuations dominate is attained and the finite temperature bkt relation for the sheet resistance applies for any @xmath267 .",
    "the last condition is satisfied because the bkt expression for the sheet resistance is simply related to the characteristic temperature dependence of the bkt correlation length .",
    "quantum fluctuations enter via the nonuniversal parameters @xmath109 and @xmath37 disclosing close to @xmath18 the respective quantum critical behavior .",
    "even though bkt critical behavior is not affected by short - range correlated and uncorrelated disorder@xcite the observation of this requires sufficiently homogeneous films and a tuning parameter which does not affect the disorder . noting that in the magnetic field tuned case there is no bkt - line , thickness and gate voltage tuned 2d - qsi transitions appear to be promising candidates . in any case",
    "the scenario outlined here requires a line of bkt - transitions @xmath81 with a quantum critical endpoint @xmath268 and sheet resistance data which attain the bkt critical regime .    to illustrate the potential and the implications of this scenario we analyzed data of bollinger _",
    "et al_.@xcite taken on gate voltage tuned epitaxial films of la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 that are one unit cell thick .",
    "evidence for dominant phase fluctuations and bkt - critical behavior was established in terms of the temperature dependence of the sheet resistance revealing a large critical regime extending substantially above the lowest attained temperature @xmath269 k. from the nonuniversal parameters @xmath70 and @xmath37 disclosing the respective quantum critical properties we derived for the quantum critical exponents the estimates : @xmath270 from @xmath109 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 from @xmath37 , yielding @xmath271 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the standard quantum scaling approach , providing an estimate for @xmath6 only , the bkt scenario uncovered @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 from the quantum critical behavior disclosed in @xmath109 and @xmath272 .",
    "additional evidence for @xmath177 was established from the comparison of the scaled data with the explicit scaling bkt scaling form of the superconductor branch .",
    "we observed that the scaled data does not fall entirely on the bkt curve .",
    "instead a flow to and away from the universal characteristics occurred .",
    "as @xmath212 decreases for fixed @xmath22 a crossover to al - behavior sets in , while the rounding of the transition leads with increasing @xmath212 to a flow away from criticality .",
    "the important lesson then is that the quality of the data collapse on a single curve heavily depends on the temperature range of the data entering the plot .",
    "another striking feature is the extended scaling regime . within the bkt scenario it follows from the fact that the explicit scaling form of the sheet resistance applies along the entire bkt transition line irrespective of the distance from the qsi transition . in the quantum",
    "scaling approach this property remains hidden and merely suggests an extended quantum critical regime .",
    "the piecewise excellent quality of the data collapse also reveals that the provision of the substantial variation of @xmath272 is essential , while in the quantum scaling approach it is fixed by the critical sheet resistance .",
    "supposing that the equivalence between quantum phase transitions with @xmath48 spatial dimensions and the ones of classical phase transitions in @xmath108 dimensions applies , the 2d - qsi transition at the endpoint of a bkt line @xmath109 should belong to the finite temperature @xmath110 universality class .",
    "our estimate @xmath11 and with that @xmath273 critical behavior where @xmath184 .",
    "however the fate of this clean critical point under the influence of disorder is controlled by the harris criterion.@xcite if the inequality  @xmath99 is fulfilled , the disorder does not affect the critical behavior . if the harris criterion is violated (  @xmath186 ) , the generic result is a new critical point with conventional power law scaling but new exponents which fulfill  @xmath186 .",
    "since @xmath184 violates this inequality disorder is relevant and drives the system from the mean - field to an other critical point with different critical exponents as our estimate , @xmath188 , consistent with @xmath274 , uncovers .",
    "the resulting 2d - qsi transition with @xmath275 and @xmath11 violates then the equivalence between quantum phase transitions in systems with @xmath48 spatial dimensions and the ones of classical phase transitions in @xmath108 dimensions .",
    "in addition the proportionality between @xmath13 and @xmath23 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ) , valid below the upper critical dimension @xmath121 , does no longer hold because @xmath190 is above @xmath276 .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) further studies are required to elucidate this option . in any case , our estimate @xmath188 , the evidence for bkt behavior at finite temperature and the harris theorem imply the presence and relevance of disorder at the qsi transition and its irrelevance at finite temperature .",
