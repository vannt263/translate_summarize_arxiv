    "the solution of double optimal stopping problem , in so called `` fishing problem '' , will be presented .",

    "the detailed review of the papers connected with `` fishing problem '' was presented by  @xcite .",
    "the simple formulation of our double optimal stopping problem is following .",
    "the angler goes to fishing .",
    "he buys fishing ticket for a fixed time @xmath0 .",
    "there are two places for fishing at the lake and he can change the place at any moment @xmath1 .",
    "the fishes are caught according to renewal processes @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of claims during the time @xmath4 at the place @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the moment of @xmath7-th claim at the place @xmath8 ( we fix @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , then the random variables @xmath11 are i.i.d . with continuous distribution function ( c.d.f . for short ) @xmath12 .",
    "the fishes weights , which were caught at the place @xmath8 , are given by the sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath13 with c.d.f .",
    "@xmath14 ( we fix @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the renewal process is independent on the sequence of claims .",
    "the angler s satisfaction measure is given by difference between the utility function @xmath17 $ ] dependent on size of the caught fishes and the cost function @xmath18 \\rightarrow [ 0,c_i ] $ ] connected with time .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are continuous and bounded , additionally @xmath20 is differentiable .",
    "on each place the angler has different utility functions and cost functions . in this way",
    ", the angler s relative opinion about these two places is modeled .",
    "for example , on the one position better sort of fish can be caught with bigger probability or one of the piers is more comfortable .",
    "the angler can change the place of fishing at any time @xmath1 .",
    "the mass of the fishes @xmath21 which were caught up to time @xmath4 if the change of the position took place at the time @xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) is given by @xmath23 let @xmath24 denote the angler s payoff for stopping at time @xmath4 if the change of the position took place at time @xmath1 .",
    "the payoff can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 . with the notation @xmath27 and @xmath28 , formula  ( [ ak z 1 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath29",
    "let @xmath30 be the @xmath31-field generated by all events up to time @xmath4 , if there was no change of parameters and @xmath32 , the @xmath31-field generated by all events up to time @xmath4 if the change of parameters was at time @xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , define for @xmath41 and @xmath42 the sets @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "obviously our angler wants to have as much satisfaction as possible and he has to leave the lake before the fixed moment .",
    "therefore his goal is to find two stopping times @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that the expected gain is maximized @xmath47 where @xmath45 corresponds to the moment , when he eventually should change the place and @xmath46 , when he should stop fishing .",
    "these stopping times should be less than the fixed moment @xmath0 .",
    "the process @xmath24 is piecewise - deterministic and belongs to the class of semi - markov processes .",
    "the optimal stopping of similar processes was studied by  @xcite .",
    "the special representation of stopping times from @xmath37 and @xmath38 is applied .",
    "it allows to use the dynamic programming methods to find these two optimal stopping times and to specify the expected satisfaction of the angler .",
