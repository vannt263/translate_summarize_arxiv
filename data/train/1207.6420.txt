    "transverse momentum dependent parton distribution arise at small @xmath0 naturally as a consequence of high energy factorization and bfkl - evolution @xcite .",
    "a formulation of high energy factorization which is in accordance with conventional collinear factorization is provided by @xmath2-factorization as defined in @xcite : at high center of mass energies , the resummation of high energy logarithms ( bfkl ) can be brought into a form consistent with conventional collinear resummation ( dglap ) .",
    "the ccfm evolution equation @xcite , which interpolates between dglap and bfkl evolution , allows then for a monte carlo implementation of @xmath2-factorization , which is realized by the monte carlo event generator cascade @xcite .",
    "based on the principle of color coherence , the ccfm parton shower describes only the emission of gluons , while real quarks emissions are left aside .",
    "note that such an approximation is in principle justified as enhanced regions of phase space for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dominated by gluonic dynamics at leading logarithmic level .",
    "for the description of unintegrated parton densities this implies that the ccfm evolution describes only the distinct evolution of unintegrated gluon and valence quarks @xcite while non - diagonal transitions between quarks and gluons are absent . on the other hand ,",
    "it is necessary to include quark emissions into the parton shower to take into account subleading effects .",
    "also the determination of @xmath2-dependent hard matrix elements is affected by the absence of quark emissions : gluon - to - quark splittings needed for the generation of seaquarks are to be included into matrix elements , which complicates their structure , see _ e.g. _ @xcite . in order to supplement the ccfm evolution with quarks we present in this contribution a definition of a partonic matrix element involving off - shell quarks and the definition of an off - shell sea - quark density . for the latter we restrict here to the case where the gluon - to - quark splitting occurs as the last evolution step . to test our procedure numerically ,",
    "we apply it to the production of a @xmath6-boson in the forward direction at lhc energies . for a detailed discussion",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "let us take the approach of generalizing @xmath2-factorization to the case of quarks by mimicking the already existing gluonic case .",
    "there off - shell gauge invariance is ensured through a reformulation of qcd at high center of mass energies in terms of effective degrees of freedom , reggeized gluons .",
    "the latter coincide in their on - shell limit with conventional collinear qcd gluons , while one uses for the general off - shell case effective vertices which contain additional induced terms ensuring off - shell gauge invariance . in complete analogy",
    "one can construct a reggeized quark formalism for the description of the high energy limit of scattering amplitudes with quark exchange in the @xmath8-channel @xcite .",
    "as ( reggeized ) quark exchanges are suppressed by powers of @xmath9 in comparison to ( reggeized ) gluon exchanges , they generally do not occur in the high energy resummation of total cross - sections .",
    "they can however be used as a starting point for the construction of an off - shell factorization of matrix elements which are limited to quark exchange in the @xmath8-channel .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath10 matrix element for which we construct @xcite an off - shell factorization into an off - shell matrix element @xmath11 and a corresponding gluon - to - quark splitting function . making use of the reggeized quark formalism",
    ", we arrive at the off - shell partonic cross - section @xmath12 , @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the light - cone momenta of the two incoming quarks , while @xmath16 denotes the transverse momentum of the off - shell quark ; @xmath17 denotes the mass of the @xmath6-boson , while @xmath18 describes the coupling of the @xmath6-boson to the quark .",
    ".   agrees for @xmath19 with the @xmath20 cross - section , while the splitting function is obtained as a pure color factor if the reggeized quark formalism is taken literally  a crude approximation which can be traced back to non - conservation of energy at the level of high - energy leading logarithms .",
    "it is possible however @xcite to supply energy conservation while maintaining all desired gauge invariance properties . doing so we arrive at the @xmath2-dependent @xcite gluon - to - quark splitting function @xmath21 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath16 denote transverse momenta of the off - shell gluon and quark respectively , while @xmath23 denotes the fraction of gluon light cone momentum which is carried on by the @xmath8-channel quark . in the on - shell limit @xmath24 eq .",
    "reduces to the collinear dglap splitting function @xmath25 $ ] at lowest order ; in the high - energy limit however it factorizes correctly the finite @xmath22 dependence to all orders . at the next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath7-dependent sea - quark density is defined by @xmath27 with @xmath28 . for the scale @xmath29 of the unintegrated gluon density",
    ", we will investigate two possible choices .",
    "one choice , closer in spirit to inclusive calculations @xcite , is to set simply @xmath30 . a choice based on angular ordering , which is more natural from the point of view of the ccfm evolution , is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the complete @xmath7-factorized cross - section for forward @xmath6-production is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 the valence quark distribution , implemented as in the first paper of  @xcite .",
    "we next compare numerically the factorized expression eq .   with the result of implementing the @xmath10 off - shell cross - section @xcite in the cascade monte carlo generator @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptandrap1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ptandrap2 ] .    for the factorized result both choices for the hard scale @xmath34 have been implemented .",
    "the differences between the matrix element ( me ) and the factorized results are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note that the factorized result contains the @xmath8-channel contribution , while the @xmath9-channel contribution is sub - leading both in the collinear and high energy limit .",
    "the factorized expression also contains a kinematical approximation  @xcite in comparison to the full @xmath10 cross - section , which leads to a small , but finite correction .    in summary",
    ", we achieved an off - shell factorization of the @xmath35 process , where the factorized expression can both analytically and numerically be shown to coincide with the full @xmath10 cross - section up to a finite remainder , sub - leading in the collinear and the high energy limit .",
