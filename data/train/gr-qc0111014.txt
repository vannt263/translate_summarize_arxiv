    "at the moment cosmology is one of the fastest changing fields in physics .",
    "this fact might , on the one hand , be ascribed to the vast amount of new observational data ( cf @xcite e.g. ) , on the other hand there are still fundamental open questions within what is nowadays called the cosmological standard model @xcite : where does the inflaton field come from ? is there a something like the cosmological constant @xmath3 which contributes to the dark energy etc . ?",
    "from a theoretical viewpoint one might divide efforts today within cosmology into two broad subclasses .",
    "firstly , we have models which extend the standard model to a certain amount , inflation @xcite , e.g. , can be viewed as an add - on for the classical friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model . all of these models have in common that they do not affect the structure of spacetime itself , i.e. , they are still bound to a four - dimensional riemannian spacetime and , in addition , do not modify the underlying gravity theory , i.e. , general relativity ( gr ) . secondly , we have models which are no longer tied to a four - dimensional riemannian spacetime and might also modify the underlying gravity theory .",
    "one example for the latter is the so - called metric - affine gauge theory of gravity ( mag ) , as proposed by hehl in @xcite . within this gauge theoretical formulation of a gravity theory",
    "there are new geometrical quantities , torsion @xmath4 and nonmetricity @xmath5 , which liberate spacetime from its riemannian structure . in this paper",
    "we are going to work within this more general framework of a post - riemannian gravity theory .",
    "the main reason to consider more general structures within cosmology is the idea that new geometrical quantities might shed light on the problems of the cosmological standard model , e.g.  provide an explanation for the rather artificial introduction of an additional scalar field , like the inflaton field .",
    "the new quantities couple to the spin , shear , and dilation currents of matter , which are supposed to come into play at high energy densities , i.e.  at early stages of the universe @xcite . another open question , which might also be attacked , is the origin of the large amount of dark energy , predicted by recent supernova observations .",
    "a model which deals with a new kind of dark matter interaction within a post - riemannian theory has been proposed by tucker and wang in @xcite .    within this paper ,",
    "we confine ourselves to a weyl - cartan spacetime .",
    "this type of spacetime can be viewed as a special case of the more general metric - affine framework , in which the tracefree part of the nonmetricity @xmath6 vanishes by definition .",
    "the reason to consider this kind of restriction is twofold .",
    "firstly , computations are more feasible in a spacetime which is not endowed with the full mag symmetries .",
    "secondly , the weyl - cartan spacetime is , unlike the riemann - cartan or the weyl spacetime , still able to carry both of the new field strengths nonmetricity and torsion .",
    "let us note that the metric - affine framework incorporates all of the above mentioned types of spacetimes .",
    "the einstein - cartan theory , which is formulated in a riemann - cartan spacetime , represents a viable gravity theory with torsion . by switching off all non - riemannian quantities in mag",
    "we arrive at gr .",
    "as becomes clear from the title , this paper stands at the beginning of series of articles on cosmological models in alternative gravity theories . in this first article",
    "we derive the field equations for an enhanced gauge lagrangian and look for solutions of these equations .",
    "thereby we extend earlier joint work with tresguerres @xcite and lay the foundation for the second article in this series , which will deal with the observational consequences of this new cosmological model .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in",
    "we derive the field equations and noether identities for a new gauge lagrangian on a formal level .",
    "after that we make use of computer algebra and provide the explicit form of the field equations and noether identities for a rather general choice of the weyl 1-form in . in we restrict our considerations to a special case , which leads to a more manageable set of field equations . in",
    "we look for exact solutions of these equations .",
    "we will draw our conclusion in and present some plots for one branch of our model . in [ mag_kapitel ] and [ weyl_cartan_kapitel ] we provide a short introduction into mag and the weyl - cartan spacetime .",
    "additionally , we show in [ weyl_cartan_kapitel ] how our model fits into the general framework of mag as proposed in @xcite . in [ units_section ] , we provide an overview over the units used throughout the preceding sections .",
    "note that we make extensive use of differential forms within this paper .",
    "a short compilation of symbols used within the paper can be found in [ operations_section ] , for a more rigorous treatment the reader should consult appendix a of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we considered the following gauge lagrangian @xmath7 where @xmath8 antisymmetric + symmetric part of the curvature , and @xmath9 .",
    "numbers in parentheses in front of quantities correspond to the irreducible decompositions performed in @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in more general gauge lagrangians ( cf equation ( [ general_v_mag ] ) for a very general one proposed in mag ) , we are going to extend ( [ lag_old ] ) .",
    "we will perform our calculations on the basis of a weyl - cartan spacetime , i.e.  a spacetime in which the tracefree part of the nonmetricity @xmath1 vanishes , a short introduction into weyl - cartan spacetime is given in [ weyl_cartan_kapitel ] .",
    "the most obvious extension of ( [ lag_old ] ) is given by @xmath10 since in a weyl - cartan space the nonmetricity is reduced to its trace part , i.e.  @xmath11 , see equation ( [ torsion_in_weyl_cartan_spacetime ] ) , equation ( [ quadratic_nonmet_term ] ) now reads @xmath12 our new lagrangian now reads @xmath13 in contrast to @xcite we included an explicit nonmetricity term in our lagrangian .",

    "the lagrangian in ( [ lag_new ] ) can be viewed as another step towards a better understanding of the full mag lagrangian as displayed in ( [ general_v_mag ] ) . since",
    "a treatment of the full lagrangian is computationally not feasible at the moment it is necessary to successively study the impact of additional terms in the lagrangian ( a review of lagrangians used in mag and exact solutions of the corresponding field equations can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "together with the quadratic rotational curvature and quadratic strain curvature terms , which were already included in our previous work @xcite , we now have an additional post - riemannian piece in form of a quadratic nonmetricity term which enhances the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian commonly used in general relativistic cosmological models .",
    "note that our lagrangian in ( [ lag_new ] ) does not include a term with the usual cosmological constant .",
    "as we will show in section [ special_case_section ] our ansatz in ( [ lag_new ] ) gives rise to an additional constant which , on the level of the field equations , will play the same role as the cosmological constant in the standard model . hence we omit an explicit cosmological constant term at this stage . from ( [ lag_new ] )",

    "we still have three distinct cases for the evolution of the scale factor , which correspond to the three different choices for @xmath91 in the ansatz for the metric in equation ( [ robertson_walker_coframe ] ) .",

    "most interestingly the non - riemannian quantities lead to a contribution to the total energy density of the universe as shown in ( [ energy_dust_lambda_neq_0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the energy density @xmath85 is no longer a quantity which is determined by the evolution of the scale factor only , like in the flrw scenario .",
    "as we will show in the next article of this series this contribution might be used to define a new energy density parameter which adds to the total energy budget of the universe . thereby leading to an interesting new source for a possible dark energy component . since the field equations differ from the friedman equations one can expect several observational changes with respect to the standard flrw model .",
    "note that an ansatz with a position dependent weyl 1-form at very early stages of the universe might contribute to the observed inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "although speculative at this time , small inhomogeneities in the new geometric quantities might also have served as seeds for structure formation at early stages , thereby yielding an interesting supplement to the quantities within the standard paradigm .",
