    ", 2008 , athey et al . 2002 ) , re - enforcing the notion that the origin is stellar rather than ism .",

    "the mid - infrared emission traces stars during their mass - losing agb phase , and this evolutionary phase is still detected in objects with ages typical of globular clusters such as 47 tucanae ( lebzelter et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "because the luminosity of an agb star depends on its mass and the main sequence turn - off mass decreases with time , the mid - infrared emission depends on the age of the stellar population .",
    "if all the stars in an early - type galaxy were created in an instantaneous burst @xmath9 ago , the mid - infrared emission would be dominated by stars on the agb with an initial mass of slightly less than @xmath10 ( for solar metallicity ) .",
    "the strength of the silicate emission from the dusty envelopes of evolved stars is a function of both age and metallicity . as pointed out by bressan , granato & silva ( 1998 ) however , the dependence of this emission on age and metallicity is different to that in the optical .    a colour - magnitude relation which includes",
    "a band containing the silicate emission from agb stars therefore traces the agb population as a function of the total luminosity , and can , in principle , be used with the optical relation to disentangle the effects of age and metallicity .    here",

    "these 4 objects were selected to have spectra that show no evidence of activity , such as recent star formation or an agn , and are intended as a ` template ' for passive objects against which to compare the more distant objects of coma .",

    "the horizontal dot - dashed line corresponds to the radius containing half of the encircled energy for the irs blue peakup psf . ]",
    "the blue peakup images ( see fig  [ fig : maps1 ] for examples ) are background dominated , with source fluxes only a few percent above the background level . in addition",
    ", the background shows fluctuations on spatial scales of several pixels .",
    "this presents a serious problem in the consistent determination of integrated fluxes for sources of different angular sizes .",
    "the standard technique of modeling the background as a smoothly varying light distribution , and then subtracting it from the image , tends to over - correct in the vicinity of larger sources , simply because the source size is similar to that of the background fluctuations . in order to avoid this problem we have opted to measure colours , rather than integrated fluxes , and to do so within a fixed angular radius of @xmath13 .",
    "the flux within this radius is background corrected by subtracting the median pixel value within an annulus just outside this aperture .",
    "the error on the derived flux was taken as the quadrature sum of the rms variation within the annulus and the calibration error , which was taken as 5% for the blue peakup data .    before applying the same procedure to irac channel 2 ( @xmath14 ) and 2mass ks - band ( @xmath15 ) images ,",
    "these were convolved to the resolution of the irs - peakup data , in order to remove colour gradients due to the differing instrumental resolutions .",
    "the measured aperture fluxes were then used to derive the colours for each object ; these colours are presented in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "aperture photometry for the 4 virgo elliptical galaxies was carried out in an analogous manner , but rather than use a circular aperture of radius @xmath13 , elliptical apertures of semi - major axis @xmath16 were used .",
    "this difference takes account of the fact that the virgo cluster is 6 times closer than coma cluster and that the images are well - resolved .",
    "there is a possibility that the use of a larger aperture in the presence of a fixed psf will introduce a systematic error in the flux determinations between the coma and virgo galaxies . in order to verify that this was not a significant source of error we constructed a number of pairs of simulated galaxy images with de vaucouleur profiles , differing in their effective radii by a factor of 6 .",
    "we then convolved each with the irs blue peakup psf and measured the flux within apertures of @xmath13 or @xmath16 accordingly .",
    "the differences in the retrieved fluxes did not exceed 10% , and were typically less than the photometric errors .",
    "all aperture photometry was performed using a custom pipeline written in idl and use was made of the _ idl astronomy user s library _ ( landsman 1995 ) .      a direct estimate of the effective radius based on an image with a high background level and fairly low signal - to - noise ratio would be rather sensitive to any error in the subtraction of the background level .",
    "in order to minimize this problem , rather than finding the radius containing half of the integrated flux , we adopted the following procedure .",
    "we first constructed a model galaxy with a de vaucouleur s @xmath12 law and convolved it with the irs blue peakup point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we either assumed that the intrinsic ellipticity of each galaxy at @xmath0 was the same as the optical value as given in `` goldmine '' or was circular , where no value was available .",
    "after convolution with the psf we measured the radial profile in circular apertures and compared this to the same apertures measured on the image .",
    "the derived value of the effective radius , @xmath17 , is that of the model galaxy whose psf - convolved fwhm was equal to that of the image profile .",
    "these values are given in table  [ tab : fluxes ] along with effective radii measured at @xmath18 by gavazzi et al .",
    "the error on the estimate of the effective radii was estimated using a monte - carlo approach . to the model galaxy ,",
    "convolved with the irs blue peakup psf , gaussian noise was added at the level present in the real images . for 200 realizations of this noise",
    ", the fwhm was measured using the same procedure as for the real images .",

    "the presence of stellar population gradients within etgs ( annibali et al . 2007 ) , together with the existence of a general increase of the effective radius with the total magnitude of the galaxy , could , however , introduce a spurious effect , since a fixed aperture measurement would probe stellar populations in relatively more central regions for brighter galaxies .    to quantify this effect we repeated the measurement within a fixed _ relative _ aperture of radius @xmath272 r@xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective radius of the galaxy .",

    "with optical / nir colour - magnitude relations and because of the presence of the four virgo etgs we argue that this line represents the mir colour - magnitude relation of _ passively evolving _ , etgs in the coma cluster .",

    "the v - k colour shows a steady increase towards brighter magnitudes with a slight flattening for objects brighter than @xmath32 .",

    "the implications of this difference are discussed further below .",
    "from an extrapolation of the nir stellar photospheric continuum into the mid - infrared bressan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have estimated that the @xmath33 emission in passive , etgs has approximately equal contributions from stellar photospheres and dust emission .",
    "the most likely origin of the latter emission is from dusty circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars , such as the mass losing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "the exact proportions depend on parameters such as the age and metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "because the photospheric contribution shows little variation for a fixed k - band magnitude , the mid - infrared colour - magnitude relation should depend strongly on the population of dusty agb stars as a function of galaxy luminosity . in this scenario ,",
    "those etgs that show an excess of @xmath33 emission have the largest luminosity - weighted dusty agb population .",
    "the evolution of this stellar population should therefore be critical to the interpretation of the mid - infrared colour - magnitude diagram",
    ".    another possible origin of an excess of emission at @xmath33 could be the contribution of a central agn , as seen in the spectrum of ngc  4486 ( bressan et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , there is no evidence of broad emission lines in the available sdss spectra of those galaxies which lie well above the ` passive ' colour - magnitude relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm12 ] .",
    "there is also no evidence that these galaxies have smaller effective radii at @xmath33 ( as shown by ngc  4486 , that appears unresolved in the sl and ll irs apertures ) .      before considering the colour - magnitude relation in terms of stellar evolution , we first consider the influences that the inter - stellar environment might have on the mid - infrared colours . in nearby",
    "agb stars a significant fraction of the @xmath33 flux originates from extended , dusty , circumstellar envelopes .",
    "it is thus important to understand how robust these envelopes are to different external perturbations , such as the ram - pressure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the central regions of massive ellipticals .",
    "the circumstellar envelope of an agb star expands at a typical velocity of @xmath34 which , at the condensation radius , r@xmath3510@xmath36 cm ( bressan et al . 1998 , granato & danese 1994 ) is of the order of the escape velocity .",
    "the mir emission , f(@xmath37 ) , in agb stars , has a broad maximum between 10 and 20 @xmath38 m suggesting a dust temperature t@xmath39 .",
    "inspection of our dusty circumstellar models shows that dust reaches this temperature only in a thin internal region of the envelope , whose size is a few tens of @xmath40 . at @xmath41",
    "the crossing time of this region is only 100  yr .",
    "thus , the mir emission from agb stars is a short lived phenomenon : after about 100  yr , dust is already so cool that its contribution in the mir spectral region becomes negligible .",
    "however , in the central regions of an etg , the star moves at the dispersion velocity through the tenuous ism , and we need to determine whether or not the circumstellar envelope is able to maintain its structure in the inner few tens of @xmath40 .    in order to estimate the radius at which the organized structure of the envelope is destroyed by its interaction with the ism , we equate the kinetic energy density in the circumstellar wind ( @xmath42 ) to the kinetic energy density of the ism , due to the stellar dispersion velocity , ( @xmath43 ) .    using a stationary wind",
    "the circumstellar gas density is @xmath44 while the ism density is evaluated from the mass that has been already lost by stars @xmath45 in the second equation @xmath46@xmath47 is the typical gas deposition rate per unit time and per unit stellar mass from the old stellar population .",
    "this is obtained from integration of the mass loss rate along our isochrones of old stellar populations ( see also tinsley 1973 ) .",
    "the average stellar density , @xmath48 , is evaluated from deprojection of the de vaucouleurs law ( young 1976 ) and depends on the assumed position within the galaxy .    applying the condition of virial equilibrium and the observed relation between the total galaxy mass and the velocity dispersion ( cappellari et al .",
    "2006 ) we find @xmath49 in this equation , r@xmath50 is the condensation radius , @xmath51 , for a silicate dust mixture ( for graphite r@xmath50 is about half this value and r / r@xmath50 must be doubled ) ; @xmath52 is the stellar mass loss rate in 10@xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath41 ; @xmath55 is the luminosity in units of 10@xmath56 ; @xmath57 is the stellar velocity dispersion in units of @xmath58 ; r@xmath28 is the effective radius of the galaxy ; @xmath59 is the dimensionless average stellar density with respect to its value at @xmath60 ( @xmath59 = 10.5 , young , 1976 ) ; m@xmath61 is the galaxy mass in units of 10@xmath62 and t@xmath63 is the time in gyr .",
    "thus , only for very low mass - loss rates ( 10@xmath64 ) or in the very central regions of a galaxy - @xmath65 - may the structure of the wind be destroyed at a few condensation radii .",
    "we may thus conclude that , in all relevant cases , the circumstellar wind is not destroyed by its interaction with the environment even in the cores of etgs .",
    "once the circumstellar envelope mixes with the ism , dust grains may be destroyed via sputtering by the hot ( @xmath66 ) ism gas .",
    "this process , however , will not affect the mir emission , because , as discussed above , when the dust is released to the ism it is already too cool to emit in the mir spectral region .",
    "furthermore , the timescale for dust grain destruction via sputtering , even in the centre of the coma cluster , is @xmath67 ( dwek , rephaeli & mather , 1990 ) , much larger than the lifetime of the newly formed hot dust within the circumstellar envelope ( @xmath27100 yr ) .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the mir emission from dust grains in agb stars is a short lived phenomenon ( @xmath68 ) happening in the inner , denser region of the circumstellar envelopes .",
    "this emission can not easily be modified by interaction with the environment , so that the environment does not have a _",
    "direct _ influence on the mid - infrared colour - magnitude relation .",

    "( 1998 ) both the integrated optical and mir colours of ssps suffer from the degeneracy between age and metallicity , but in the opposite sense . while optical features ( colours or narrow band indices ) of the same strength can be obtained by an _",

    "2007 ) , an equal intensity of the 10@xmath38 m bump may be obtained by a _ correlated _ variation of the age and metallicity .",

    "new ssp models , for the indicated age and metallicity , have been computed following the scheme of bressan et al .",
    "the only difference with respect to these previous models is a minor revision of the mass loss rate during the agb phase , introduced by the calibration with new v - k integrated colours of populous star clusters in the large magellanic cloud , and the adoption of the new empirical library of stellar spectra ( snchez - blzquez et al . , 2006b ) .",
    "a few caveats concerning models should be kept in mind because they are relevant to the present investigation .",
    "first of all , it is worth recalling that in bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the effects of possible circumstellar dust in the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase ( i.e. before central helium burning in the horizontal branch in the case of old populations ) have not been considered .",
    "recent claims , that rgb stars also show a significant mir excess not dependent on their luminosity ( origlia et al . 2007 ) , should be regarded with great care because of possible strong crowding effects ( boyer et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , old stellar populations in the galaxies we are considering could reach super - solar metallicity and , as such , may not be well represented by those in our own galaxy .",
    "very little is actually known on the efficiency of the mass - loss rate at high metallicity ( carraro et al .",
    "however , van loon et al . ( 2008 ) do not find evidence of a mir excess in the rgb stars of ngc  6791 , a super metal - rich globular cluster . also , ngc  4649 and ngc  1399 , the two etgs with the largest uv upturn and high mg2 index ( bertola et al . 1995 ) , that have been interpreted as the signature of very metal - rich stars ( bressan , chiosi & fagotto 1994 ) , have spitzer irs spectra similar to those observed in our passive virgo etgs ( bressan et al . in preparation ) .",
    "thus , there seems to be no evidence that metallicity has a direct effect on mass loss .",
    "as already anticipated , variations of age and metallicity are very well separated in this colour - colour diagram , especially at high metallicity , with iso - metallicity lines being almost horizontal and coeval ssps moving on almost vertical lines .",
    "in contrast , models without dusty agb envelopes collapse to the almost horizontal dashed lines at the bottom of the diagram , independent of their ages .",
    "the effects of dust disappear at ages larger than 13 gyr , where the agb phase is practically absent .",
    "we have extended the photospheric stellar spectra of miles in the nir / mir region by means of matched nextgen models ( hauschildt et al .",
    "in addition , the effects of dusty envelopes have been included following the prescriptions described in bressan et al .",
    "thus , the bottom horizontal dashed lines ( models without dusty agb envelopes ) superimpose on single nextgen spectra at varying effective temperature .",
    "the effect of varying the metallicity is almost negligible in the k@xmath1-[16 ] colour . to illustrate the difference introduced by adopting different stellar spectra we have marked with an asterisk the position of a comarcs low temperature atmosphere model as calculated by aringer et al .",

    "a possible interpretation , discussed in the previous section , is that these systems have average younger ages , since a younger stellar population is expected to have a redder mir emission by virtue of the larger fraction of dusty agb stars .",

    "( 2006 ) concluded that the fraction of early - type galaxies that show signatures of recent activity is 17% .",
    "this figure is significantly lower than the fraction of coma etgs with a k@xmath1-[16 ] colour excess .",
    "we have also extracted , from data release 6 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) the available spectra ( 16 out of 50 ) of our coma galaxy sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss ] we show the @xmath73 spectral region , around the caii lines .",
    "galaxies are sorted by decreasing brightness and green curves represent objects with a k@xmath1-[16 ] colour excess . in three objects",
    "( d103 , d118 and d155 ) with a k@xmath1-[16 ] excess , the caii h line is as deep as the k line , indicating contamination by a type stars , i.e. a recent rejuvenation episode . in the other galaxies the caii doublet appears normal .",
    "we recall , that for solar metallicity , an inversion of the caii doublet starts appearing only at ages younger than 2 gyr ( longhetti et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "although we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccentre ] that the k@xmath1-[16 ] colour is uncorrelated with the position in the cluster we note that if we identify those galaxies with an ` excess ' of @xmath33 emission as those with @xmath74 > 1.5 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cm12 ] ) then the mean projected distance from the cluster centre of this population is smaller than for those galaxies with @xmath74 < 1.5 $ ] .",
    "the mean projected distance from the cluster centre for the @xmath33 excess galaxies is @xmath75 whereas that for the others is @xmath76 ( the ks - probability that the 2 distributions are the same is 1.6% ) .",
    "because it seems that the cluster environment does not directly influence the mid - infrared colour - magnitude diagram this suggests that the star formation history has been modified by the environment ; which in turn influences the galaxy colours .",
    "the sense of this influence is that galaxies with redder k@xmath1-[16 ] colour ( younger luminosity weighted stellar ages , fig .  [",
    "fig : colourcolour ] ) are preferentially found at small cluster - centric radii .",
    "miller , neal & owen ( 2002 ) have investigated the distribution of both agn and star - forming galaxies as a function of cluster - centric distance .",
    "they find that dusty star - forming galaxies have a more centrally concentrated distribution than normal star - forming galaxies , with agn being more centrally concentrated than both .",
    "though there is no evidence of emission lines in the sdss spectra , we can not exclude that the mir excess is due to an obscured nuclear starburst like that found in ngc  4435 .",
    "a possible way to check this possibility is by means of existing irac 4.5@xmath38 m and 8@xmath38 m observations ( sampling the strength of the 7.7 pah feature ) and mips 24@xmath38 m ( sampling the presence of hot dust ) .",
    "this work is underway .",
    "the mir colour - magnitude relation indicates that the oldest coma early - type galaxies define a sequence of increasing metallicity at constant age ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "while this conclusion has already been suggested by the analysis of the optical / nir colour - magnitude relation , it is only with the use of the complementary mir observations that the alternative solution ( invoking a synchronization of the epoch of formation with total brightness , see bower , lucey & ellis , 1992 ) can be excluded .",
    "indeed , our analysis of the mixed optical - nir - mir colour - colour diagram clearly shows that some of the galaxies that populate the optical colour - magnitude relation may have average ages that are even 40% younger than the old sequence . in those galaxies , however ,",
    "a larger metallicity may redden the colours and compensate for the younger age in an optical diagram .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the mir colour in breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "our conclusion is in very good agreement with the analysis of narrow band indices of @xmath79 etgs carefully selected from the sdss survey ( clemens et al .",
    "2006 ) and recently extended to @xmath80 objects with the dr6 catalogue ( clemens et al .",
    "2008 in prep . ) .",
    "these authors find that the luminosity - weighted ages of the whole sample start young at a low velocity dispersion , rise until @xmath81 and flatten at larger @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , the metallicity shows a continuous increase with increasing @xmath82 .    our result , that a large fraction of etgs in coma populate a genuine old and coeval sequence , contrasts somewhat with the recent study of etgs in the coma cluster by trager et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . based on optical spectra",
    "these authors also find that , in spite of a wide range in mass , 10/12 objects are consistent with the hypothesis of a coeval population .",
    "however , the age they find for this population , @xmath83 , is significantly younger than our value .",
    "we notice that this discrepancy is unlikely to be caused by a significant offset between ages derived with the two methods . indeed , there are four objects in common , for which trager et al .",
    "find the following ages : d129 ( gmp3329 ) 7.9 gyr , d157 ( gmp3484 ) 7.8 gyr , d155 ( gmp3367 ) 4.5 gyr and d133 ( gmp3639 ) 3 gyr .",
    "d129 and d157 , the two old objects , fall on our mir colour - magnitude relation , for which we derive only sligthly older ages . on the other hand d155 and d133 ,",
    "the two young objects , lie well above this relation and , given their k@xmath1-[16 ] colour we would conclude that they are possibly affected by some rejuvenation episode .    considering that , contrary to our analysis , optical studies are affected by the age - metallicity degeneracy causing ( large ) uncertainties that are difficult to quantify , we believe that there is good agreement for the few objects in common .",
    "it is more difficult to explain why we find that 68% of the galaxies in our sample populate the old sequence , while trager et al .",
    "find that only 25% are old .",
    "if their sample is not biased toward young objects and given the sensitivity of the k@xmath1-[16 ] colour to rejuvenation events , we suspect that the age - metallicity degeneracy is still to blame .",
    "bregman et al . ( 2006 ) find a very similar discrepancy between the age of etgs determined by optical line indices and mid - infrared spitzer spectra that include the silicate emission feature near @xmath6 .",
    "they also find mean ages of @xmath84 using mid - infrared data .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the upper 2.5 mag of the mir colour - magnitude relation is quite narrow . on the contrary , in the lower 2.5 mag , below m@xmath85",
    ", there is a significant dispersion .",
    "this shows that the rejuvenation events ( of any kind ) have not affected the most massive etgs .",
    "we present @xmath0 , spitzer - irs , blue peakup images of a sample of 50 etgs in the coma cluster .",
    "we compare these with archival irac images at @xmath14 and 2mass , @xmath86 band images at @xmath15 .",
    "we make the following conclusions .    *",
    "our irs blue peakup images show no evidence that the @xmath0 emission is anything other than stellar in origin * the region within a dusty agb star envelope where dust is hot enough to emit strongly at @xmath0 is not vulnerable to environmental effects such as the ram - pressure of an ism wind or dust sputtering by hot gas .",
    "dust grains only spend @xmath68 near @xmath87 and this region is sufficiently dense to survive against ram - pressure disruption . *",
    "we identify the mid - infrared colour - magnitude relation of passively evolving etgs as the lower envelope of the galaxy distribution in the k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] vs k@xmath88 plane ; that is , the minimum value of k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] at a given k@xmath88 magnitude .",
    "@xmath2768% of the galaxies in our sample lie on this colour - magnitude relation .",
    "these galaxies can not have had any episode of star formation accounting for more than @xmath89 of the total stellar mass within the last few gyr .",
    "these are genuinely ` passively evolving ' objects .",
    "the remaining objects are either significantly younger than 10 gyr or have undergone a rejuvenation event in the recent past .",
    "this result is at odds with the most recent estimate of the fraction of old objects based on optical spectroscopy ( trager et al .",
    "* we construct the mixed optical - nir - mir two colour diagram and , by means of updated simple stellar population models , we show that the addition of mid - infrared data allows a much better separation of the effects of age and metallicity , which are rather degenerate in either the optical or mid - infrared when taken in isolation . in this plane galaxies populating the colour - magnitude relation trace a sequence of _",
    "varying metallicity at approximately constant age_. although this conclusion was already consistent with the optical - nir colour - magnitude relation , a correlation between age and metallicity could equally well explain the relation .",
    "indeed , comparison with the optical - nir colours shows that _ a number of galaxies that lie on the optical - nir relation are significantly displaced from the mid - infrared relation _",
    ", with redder k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] colours .",
    "the mid - infrared colour - magnitude diagram therefore shows a sequence of metallicity for old , passive galaxies , with younger objects displaced towards redder k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] colours .",
    "* the oldest elliptical galaxies in our sample have luminosity weighted , mean stellar ages of 10.5 gyr and metallicities within a factor of two of the solar value .",
    "no galaxy in our sample is as old or metal poor as the globular cluster 47 tuc . *",
    "although the addition of the k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] colour allows us to identify objects with significantly younger , luminosity weighted , mean stellar ages , we can not distinguish between genuinely ` young ' objects and those that have undergone a minor rejuvenation event .",
    "however , given that even a period of recent ( last few gyr ) star formation that accounts for less than 1% of the total stellar mass will shift a galaxy off the mid - infrared colour - magnitude relation , the latter option seems far more likely .",
    "unambiguous resolution of this issue will require the infrared spectroscopic capabilities of future space observatories .",
    "* there is evidence that those galaxies that have an excess in the k@xmath88 - [ 16 ] colour are found preferentially at smaller cluster - centric radii . as the interaction between the dusty agb star envelopes and",
    "the ism does not directly effect the @xmath0 emission , the excess may be caused by `` rejuvenation '' episodes induced by the cluster environment .",
