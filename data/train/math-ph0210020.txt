    "quantum electrodynamics in a four dimensional space time , ( qed)@xmath0 , is the basic theory of electrons and photons .",
    "the theory is very singular at short distances .",
    "nevertheless it does have a well defined perturbation theory ( expansion in the coupling constant ) provided various renormalizations are carried out . at this level",
    "it gives a spectacularly precise description of nature .",
    "one would like to have a rigorous non - perturbative construction of the model .",
    "to date this has not been possible and success is not likely anytime soon .",
    "however the singularities are weaker in lower dimensions and there is the possibility of progress . in this sequence of papers",
    "we give a construction of ( qed)@xmath1 . to avoid long distance ( infrared ) problems , which are also present , we work on the three dimensional torus",
    ".    the theory is formally defined by functional integrals .",
    "the program is to add cutoffs to take out the short distance ( ultraviolet ) singularities and make the theory well - defined .",
    "then one tries to remove the cutoffs .",
    "the singularities that develop are to be cancelled by adjusting the bare parameters - this is renormalization . at the same time",
    "one must keep control throughout over the size of the functional integrals - this is the stability problem .",
    "an effective way to deal with these difficulties is to regularize the theory by putting it on a lattice and then study the continuum limit .",
    "this regularization has the advantage of preserving gauge invariance .",
    "this helps with the treatment of the singularities- the counterterms required are minimal .",
    "the stability problem also seems more tractable in the lattice approximation .",
    "our general method is the renormalization group ( rg ) technique .",
    "we first scale up to a unit lattice theory . by block",
    "averaging we generate a sequence of effective actions corresponding to different length scales .",
    "the effective coupling constant starts from near zero and grows but remains small .",
    "renormalization cancellations are made perturbatively at each level .",
    "the remainders must also be controlled and for this we need control over the size of the gauge field .",
    "this is accomplished by breaking the functional integral into large and small field regions at each level .",
    "the contribution of the large field region is suppressed by the free measure , and in the small field region we can do the perturbative analysis . stability emerges naturally in this approach as well .",
    "the scheme outlined above was originally developed by balaban for a study of scalar ( qed)@xmath1 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see also king @xcite .",
    "the method was further developed by balaban , brydges , imbrie , and jaffe @xcite , @xcite who used it in their study of the higgs mechanism for this model .",
    "there is further exposition of this work in lecture notes by imbrie @xcite .",
    "balaban continued by proving basic stability bounds for pure yang - mills ym@xmath1 , ym@xmath0 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "balaban , ocarroll , and schor @xcite , @xcite gave an analysis of the fermion propagators that arise in a rg approach .",
    "these papers were the main inspiration for the present work .",
    "let us also mention some earlier related results .",
    "weingarten and challifour @xcite and weingarten @xcite gave a construction of ( qed)@xmath2 .",
    "for scalar electrodynamics there is extensive work for @xmath3 by brydges , frhlich , and seiler @xcite .",
    "magnen and seneor gave a treatment of yukawa in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for a heuristic discussion of ( qed)@xmath1 see @xcite .",
    "the present work will not directly generalize to ( qed)@xmath0 .",
    "the problem is that this model lacks ultraviolet asymptotic freedom , the flow of the effective coupling constants away zero .",
    "however the present work is progress toward a construction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xmath5 , the fundamental theory of the strong interactions .",
    "it seems likely that combining balaban s results on yang - mills @xcite,@xcite with the present work would be sufficient , albeit still on a torus .",
    "acknowledgement : i would like to thank t. balaban for helpful conversations .",

    "the lattice version of euclidean ( qed)@xmath1 in the feynman gauge is defined by the density @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the lattice dirac operator with potential @xmath13 and coupling constant @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are mass and energy counterterms .",
    "we are interested in integrals like the normalization factor ( partition function ) @xmath18 and in correlation functions such as the two point function @xmath19 the problem is to control the @xmath20 limit .    let us explain the terms in ( [ def1 ] ) is more detail .",
    "the gauge field @xmath21 is a real valued function on bonds @xmath22 ( nearest neighbors ) in @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 . if @xmath25 are oriented unit basis vectors we write @xmath26 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath27 in the direction @xmath28 is @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the quadratic form defined by the lattice laplacian : @xmath31    the fermion fields @xmath32 are indexed by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "they are the natural basis for the space of functions from the lattice to pairs of four component spinors .",

    "this can also be written as @xmath40 formally the @xmath41 terms disappear as @xmath20 and we get the usual continuum action @xmath42 .",
    "the propagator for this action has some well - known pathologies when @xmath43 , so we take a fixed @xmath44 .",
    "actually we want a modification of the above corresponding to anti - periodic boundary conditions for the fermions . instead of basis vectors @xmath45 indexed by the torus @xmath46 we consider basis vectors @xmath45 indexed by the infinite lattice @xmath47 , but with the identifications",
    "@xmath48 then @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 .",
    "thus it is a function on the torus and so we can define sums like @xmath51 which appear in ( [ dirac ] ) .",
    "the anti - periodic boundary conditions are necessary for osterwalder - schrader positivity , that is for a hilbert space structure @xcite .",
    "this is physically desirable and will also be technically useful .",
    "the above expression depends on three parameters : the coupling constant @xmath52 , the fermion mass @xmath53 , and the photon mass @xmath54 .",
    "the parameters @xmath55 are arbitrary .",
    "the photon mass is added because the feynman gauge is not a complete gauge .",
    "we need it to suppress constant fields .",
    "one would really like to eliminate it , but this would mean picking another gauge or using the wilson action . in either case the treatment would be more complicated , but still feasible .",
    "we regard the photon mass as a convenience , not an essential modification of this uv problem .",
    "the model has a charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "define the charge conjugation matrix @xmath56 to satisfy @xmath57 and we can take @xmath58 .",
    "then we have @xmath59 . under the transformation",
    "@xmath60 the term @xmath61 is invariant .",
    "in fact the entire density has this symmetry and we preserve it throughout our analysis .",
    "the term @xmath61 is also invariant under gauge transformations : @xmath62 the term @xmath30 is of course not invariant",
    ". nevertheless we will be able to preserve a substantial amount of gauge invariance throughout the analysis    * the scaled model * : before proceeding we scale the problem up to a unit lattice with large volume .",

    "remark*. the dirac operator @xmath76 depends on the potential @xmath77 through the phase @xmath78 . in analyzing the model",
    "it is tempting to replace @xmath78 by @xmath79 right from the start .",
    "the first term gives a kinetic term and the second a potential .",
    "this does break gauge invariance , but the split is natural for a perturbative analysis and the associated rg transformations are clean .",
    "we refrain from making the split because we do not have good control over the size of @xmath77 .",
    "the potential is not necessarily small even though @xmath80 is small .",
    "( the term @xmath81 in the density does not give any significant suppression of large @xmath77 because the the coefficient @xmath82 is too small . )",
    "instead we wait and carry out the split in each fluctuation step . by declining to do it all at once we are going to have background fields in our fermion propagators .",
    "this will prove to be a nuisance .",
    "renormalization means adjusting bare parameters to cancel the singularities in the theory .",
    "since our model is super - renormalizable it suffices to choose the counterterms to cancel singularities in low order perturbation theory .",
    "suppose one splits off a potential as above and computes various quantities to second order in @xmath80 .",

    "wick ordering removes self - contraction in the counterterm . ]",
    "the singularity comes from the non - summability of @xmath96 . as @xmath97 the best estimates uniform in @xmath75 are @xmath98 for bosons and @xmath99 for fermions and hence @xmath100 .",
    "this gives the logarithmic divergence when summed .",
    "the counterterm is chosen to compensate and we take @xmath101 this is independent of @xmath102 by translation invariance .    when the cutoffs are removed the divergent part of @xmath74 formally vanishes by symmetry considerations .",
    "this suggests that perhaps we do not really need the mass counterterm .",
    "we include it nevertheless as a convenient way to cancel dangerous looking terms in our effective actions .",
    "along these lines we mention also that @xmath74 is formally a dirac scalar when the cutoffs are removed .",
    "we do not claim it is true as it stands .",
    "the vacuum energy counterterm can also be chosen from looking at the divergences in perturbation theory .",
    "but now one would have to include all diagrams up to sixth order .",
    "we do not really want to go to the trouble of keeping track of all these diagrams , particularly since the vacuum energy does not contribute at all to the correlation functions .",
    "instead we pick a counterterm by a method more suited to our analysis .",
    "the counterterm is taken to have the form @xmath103 where the @xmath104 term is chosen to remove dangerous terms in the @xmath105 rg step .",

    "the renormalization group ( rg ) is a series of transformations which average out the short distance features of the model , leaving only the the long distance properties in which we are interested ( now that we have scaled the model ) .",
    "here we define a simple version of the first rg transformation .",
    "our purpose is to explain the general idea and establish some notation .",
    "this simple version will not be suitable for iteration which is the eventual goal .",
    "_ counterterms are omitted_.    first we define averaging operators .",
