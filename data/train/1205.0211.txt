    "many social phenomena can be modelled and analysed using the methods of statistical physics .",
    "opinion dynamics is one such phenomenon where the microscopic interactions taking place between individuals can lead to cooperative behaviour of the society , like the emergence of a consensus or agreement .",
    "recently , several opinion dynamics models with continuous opinion have been proposed in which the opinions are updated after a pair of individuals interact and exchange opinion . here the interaction scheme is similar to a kinetic theory of gas , where one assumes that gas molecules can collide and consequently exchange energy and momentum .",
    "two basic opinion dynamics models having such kinetic exchange scheme are due to deffuant et al @xcite and lallouache et al @xcite , which involve completely different concepts . in this paper , we attempt to combine the concepts used in these two basic models in a single model . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review these two models . in section iii ,",
    "the proposed model is described .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "deffuant et al @xcite introduced a simple model ( dnaw model hereafter ) in which opinion exchanges between two agents take place only when the difference in the original opinions is less than or equal to a preassigned quantity @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the opinion of the @xmath12th agent interacting with the @xmath13th agent at time @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , then in this model the opinions evolve according to : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a constant ( @xmath18 ) called the convergence parameter and @xmath19 lies in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the dynamics is such that the opinions tend to come closer after interaction .",
    "hence as the dynamics proceeds , convergence to a finite number of opinions happens ; opinions cluster around a few values and individuals belonging to different clusters no longer interact .",
    "the initial distribution of the individual opinions is uniform and therefore symmetric .",
    "this symmetry is broken as the time evolved distribution has a multipeaked delta function form .",
    "when there is only one peak in the final distribution , it is said to be a case of _ consensus _ , two peaks imply _ polarisation _ and the existence of a larger ( finite ) number of peaks signifies _ fragmentation _ in the society .",
    "the model is conservative as total opinion is conserved in each interaction .",
    "obviously , in this conservative model , consensus would imply that opinions converge to the value 1/2 .",
    "several models have been formulated incorporating the idea of bounded confidence later @xcite and a general form of kinetic exchange type model proposed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a model in which kinetic exchanges take place with randomness , and where there is no conservation , has been introduced by lallouache et al @xcite ( lccc model hereafter ) .",
    "any two agents can interact in this unrestricted model .",
    "the opinion evolution here follows the rule : @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "o_j(t+1 ) & = & \\lambda[o_j(t ) + \\epsilon^\\prime o_i(t ) ] ; \\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are drawn randomly from uniform distributions in @xmath23 $ ] . in this model @xmath1 is a parameter which is interpreted as ` conviction ' .",
    "the opinions are bounded , i.e. , @xmath24 ; in case @xmath19 exceeds 1 or becomes less than @xmath25 , it is set to @xmath26 and @xmath25 in the respective cases .",
    "it is possible to rescale the opinions in the dnaw model so that they lie in the interval @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "continuous opinions are relevant in cases like supporting a issue , rating a movie etc . thus setting the interval as @xmath27 $ ] appears to be more meaningful since a positive ( negative ) value of the opinion will mean liking ( disliking ) the motion .",
    "the magnitude of the opinion would then simply correspond to the amount of liking or disliking . for the rest of the paper , we thus consider opinions @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "as there is no conservation in the lccc model , the average opinion given by @xmath29 for a population of @xmath30 agents , evolves in time and @xmath31 can play the role of an order parameter .",
    "it is , in fact , analogous to magnetisation in magnetic systems .",
    "one can say that there is order / disorder when @xmath32 converges to a nonzero / zero value .",
    "the model shows a unique behaviour : below a critical value of @xmath33 , all opinions identically turn out to be zero while above it , there is a nonzero value of the average opinion .",
    "thus for @xmath34 , an ordered phase exists .",
    "interestingly , the opinions in the ordered phase have either all positive or all negative values .",
    "generalisation and variations of the lccc model have been considered in some subsequent works @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking has different connotations in the conserved dnaw model and the nonconserved lccc model . in the former ,",
    "if opinions are initially in the interval @xmath27 $ ] , a consensus implies convergence of all opinions to zero value and this is regarded as symmetry breaking as mentioned earlier . in lccc",
    ", the identical state of all zeros is also obtained below @xmath33 even without putting any restriction on the interactions .",
    "however , this state has been interpreted as a symmetric state @xcite .",
    "this is following the idea that as @xmath35 here , it is like a paramagnetic state ( which is a symmetric state in magnetic systems ) .",
    "but obviously , this is a very special paramagnetic state which also has zero fluctuation .",
    "having conservation in the opinions is rather unrealistic but the concept of having a bounded confidence level is relevant in many cases . on the other hand , it is true that people may have a conviction level in their and in others opinions .",
    "we thus combine the lccc model and the dnaw model by putting the restriction of the bounded confidence in the former .",
    "it has to be realised that the conviction and bounded confidence are independent concepts and the parameters associated with these may be regarded as independent . putting a bounded confidence may be applicable to cases in which there are groups of people ( e.g. , members of a political party ) who share similar opinion and interact within themselves primarily . on the other hand , conviction is associated with individual behaviour .",
    "it is known that in models with bounded confidence , for small confidence level , the society is fragmented because of lack of communication . a large value of conviction is not expected to help reach consensus when the confidence level is low when we combine the two concepts , as the groups stick to their original opinions in this case .",
    "on the other hand , even when confidence level is large , very large values of conviction can make the society polarised as both positive and negative opinions can prevail simultaneously .    in the model proposed in the present paper ,",
    "we follow eq ( [ eq : lccc ] ) for the evolution of opinions but put the restriction that agents interact only when @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath2 is once again the parameter representing the confidence level and can vary from zero to 1 .",
    "we therefore have two parameters in the model , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath37 is identical to the original lccc model .",
    "@xmath10 is an interesting limit . here",
    ", agents interact only when their opinions are exactly same",
    ". we will discuss this limit in greater detail later .",
    "the order parameter in this model is the one defined for the lccc model , i.e. , @xmath38 . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we adopt the following terminology for the present nonconserved model : when @xmath35 and also the individual opinion distribution is a delta function peaked at zero , we call it a _ neutral _ state .",
    "if it is not a delta function at zero but @xmath39 , the state will be termed a _",
    "disordered _ state .",
    "when @xmath40 , it is an _ ordered _ state ; further if all individuals have identical opinion ( which is perhaps only ideological as opinions are continuously distributed ) , it is a _ consensus _ state . hence consensus is not merely an agreement in this terminology .",
    "obviously , in the conserved system , the nomenclature of order and disorder is irrelevant .",
    "we intend to locate the regions of neutrality , order and disorder in the present model in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "we take a population of @xmath30 agents and let it evolve according to the dynamical rules defined above ( i.e. , eq [ eq : lccc ] with a bounded confidence level @xmath2 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the order parameter after the system reaches equilibrium is presented in fig .",
    "[ mag - lambda ] . as a function of @xmath1 ,",
    "we find that the order parameter first assumes non - zero values at a threshold value of @xmath41 which is independent of @xmath2 ; @xmath42 as in the original lccc model .",
    "the order parameter increases with @xmath1 beyond @xmath43 up to a certain value of @xmath1 and decreases to zero as @xmath1 is increased further .",
    "the decrease becomes steeper with @xmath2 and more so when the system size is increased .",
    "the results indicate that there are three distinct regions : one ordered region for intermediate values of @xmath1 and two regions at low and high values of @xmath1 where the order parameter vanishes",
    ". these two regions may be either disordered or neutral .",
    "we also study the behaviour of another quantity @xmath44 defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the fraction of population with opinion greater than zero and @xmath47 in a particular configuration .",
    "@xmath48 denotes average over all configurations .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath44 is equal to unity both in the neutral state and ordered state of lccc ( in the numerical study , we take an opinion value to be equal to zero when its absolute value is less than @xmath49 @xcite ) .",
    "deviation of @xmath44 from unity will indicate that opinions with both signs are present in general .",
    "we notice that @xmath44 remains close to unity as @xmath1 is increased from zero before showing a sharp fall close to a value of @xmath1 where the order parameter also starts to fall ( fig .",
    "[ mag - lambda ] inset ) .",
    "evidently , as the system enters the disordered state , individual opinions are @xmath50 and @xmath51 with equal probability .",
    "@xmath44 has a monotonic behaviour and is useful to locate the transition to the disordered state .",
    "moreover , comparison of @xmath44 and @xmath31 shows that these two measures become closer and tend to merge as @xmath1 is increased further .",
    "this indicates that as one moves deeper into the disordered region , opinions become more and more close to the extreme values @xmath52 , leading to a polarisation tendency in the opinions .      to understand the nature of the phases ,",
    "the distribution of individual opinions may be studied .",
    "such studies are known to lead to a correct speculation about phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this study shows ( fig .",
    "[ mag - dist ] ) that the probability for zero opinion is nearly equal to 1 below @xmath42 as in the lccc model for all @xmath2 .",
    "hence a neutral state exists here as well and the confidence level is absolutely irrelevant as @xmath53 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it may be noted that a plateau like region exists in the distribution where the individual opinions have more or less the same probability .",
    "the extent of the plateau depends on @xmath1 and shrinks with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "one can investigate the reason for the existence of such a plateau region by some further analysis .",
    "let us take specifically the example of @xmath54 and @xmath55 where the plateau extends from about @xmath56 to nearly @xmath57 .",
    "it should be noted that even in equilibrium the individual opinions undergo dynamics .",
    "we tag individuals with absolute value of opinion greater than 0.75 at a time when the system has reached equilibrium and note their evolution .",
    "first , the probability @xmath58 that these remain greater than @xmath59 in subsequent times is calculated . for a ergodic case ,",
    "i.e. , if the opinions can span the entire opinion space with equal probability , this probability should be around 0.25 .",
    "we find , however , that @xmath58 is nearly 0.9 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the opinions remain within this interval with a high probability and one need not really bother about opinions with lesser values to analyse the situation in the plateau region .",
    "@xmath58 may be close to unity if opinions reach a fixed point ( or weakly fluctuate about one ) and does not imply that a plateau like region will emerge .",
    "hence we probe further by splitting the interval into further subdivisions .",
    "we estimate separately @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 where , + ( i ) @xmath60 is the probability that opinions at later times are greater than 0.99 + ( ii ) @xmath61 is the probability that opinions at later times lie between 0.89 and 0.99 + ( iii ) @xmath62 is the probability that opinions at later times lie between 0.79 and 0.89 .",
    "+ one can define other probabilities but these three are sufficient for our purpose in the present case .",
    "we also take three mutually exclusive subsets of the tagged agents with initial values of @xmath63 between 0.75 to 0.80 ( subset a ) , between 0.85 to 0.9 ( subset b ) and between 0.95 to 1.0 ( subset c ) . here",
    "initial value implies the value at the time of tagging after the system has equilibriated .",
    "we separate out @xmath60 as the probability of individual opinions having values very close to unity is much greater than the plateau height ( this is simply because of the imposed boundary condition on the opinions ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ mag - dist ] .",
    "the idea is that if opinions do reach ( nearly ) fixed point values , @xmath61 and @xmath62 should be grossly different for all the subsets a , b and c ( e.g. , for a , @xmath61 will be less than @xmath62 etc . ) on the other hand , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 turn out to be close to each other for any subset , one can conclude that the subspace @xmath64 is uniformly accessible to the agents within that subset .",
    "moreover if these probabilities are independent of subset a , b and c , one can argue that a plateau region will exist .",
    "we find all the three probabilities @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 to be independent of the subset considered ( fig . [ plateau ] ) .",
    "@xmath60 turns out to be much higher than the other probabilities as expected and indeed , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are very close to each other for @xmath54 .",
    "hence the plateau exists and the reason is the opinions here evolve in such a way that only part of the opinion space is spanned but spanned with equal probability .",
    "we have in fact obtained @xmath65 and @xmath58 for other values of @xmath1 for @xmath55 and shown them in fig .",
    "[ plateau ] .    as @xmath1",
    "is increased beyond @xmath43 , in a single configuration , only all positive or all negative values are obtained as @xmath66 , while the average over all configurations is symmetric about zero as expected . however , as @xmath1 is increased further , the opinions , even in a single configuration , assume both negative and positive values symmetrically ( fig .",
    "[ mag - dist ] inset ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the results for the quantity @xmath44 presented earlier .",
    "hence we infer that an order - disorder transition is taking place at a value @xmath67 which is later confirmed from more detailed analysis . for @xmath68 , the lccc model , @xmath69 is equal to 1 as expected .",
    "the ordered , disordered and neutral regions may be identified in a phase diagram in the @xmath70 plane . to obtain the phase boundaries in this plane",
    ", we estimate the phase transition points by traditional methods , i.e. , attempt finite size scaling for the relevant physical variables , if possible . among these variables",
    "is the fourth order binder cumulant ( bc ) defined as @xmath71 here we discuss the case for @xmath9 and @xmath4 separately for reasons which will be clear later .",
    "@xmath4 : plotting @xmath72 against @xmath1 , we find that there is indeed a crossing point but interestingly , the bc shows a negative dip ( fig .",
    "[ bc ] ) for @xmath73 for the system sizes considered .",
    "in fact it becomes more negative as the system size @xmath30 is increased and the location of the negative dip approaches the crossing point as well .",
    "these are typical indications of a first order phase transition @xcite . to confirm whether a first order transition is really taking place",
    ", we also plot the distribution of the order parameter very close to @xmath69 .",
    "one expects the distribution to have peaks at nonzero values of @xmath31 below the critical point ( usually the distribution is a double gaussian ) . for a continuous phase transition ,",
    "as the critical point is approached from below , the peaks occur at smaller and smaller values of @xmath31 , finally merging at @xmath35 continuously at the critical point . for a first order phase transition , on the other hand",
    ", the peaks at nonzero values of the order parameter remain at more or less the same positions up to the transition point @xcite .",
    "here we find exactly this behaviour ( fig .",
    "[ op - dist ] ) ; note that for finite systems , weak peaks will still show at nonzero values of @xmath31 just above the transition point ( instead of a perfect gaussian with mean zero ) .",
    "we attempt to obtain scaling forms for the bc ( @xmath72 ) , order parameter ( @xmath31 ) and a quantity analogous to susceptibility per spin ( in magnetic systems ) given by @xmath74 $ ] where @xmath75 is the total opinion , @xmath76 .",
    "the expected behaviour are given by @xmath77    for first order phase transitions in finite systems , one expects that instead of a delta function behaviour at the transition point , there will be a peak in the susceptibility which will diverge with the system size .",
    "the order parameter exponent @xmath78 is expected to be close to zero .",
    "we find that the above scaling forms are indeed appropriate in the present case , the data collapse to a single curve for specific values of @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( shown for @xmath31 and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ collapses ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is indeed very close to zero and @xmath82 for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath80 appears to have a systematic variation with @xmath2 . since @xmath2 effectively puts a restriction on the number of compatible neighbours , it is not surprising that @xmath80 , which is associated with @xmath30 , shows a dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "the values of the transition point @xmath69 and the exponents are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".the transition point and the values of the exponents for @xmath83 .",
    "the typical errors in the data are @xmath84 for @xmath69 ; @xmath85 for @xmath80 , @xmath86 for @xmath78 and @xmath87 for @xmath79 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    all the above discussions are however , valid for @xmath88 only .",
    "the first order phase transition is most strongly observed close to @xmath55 . as for the negative dip ,",
    "it is not observed for @xmath89 with @xmath90 , but the values of the exponents indicate that the transition is first order - like . the negative dip for @xmath89 is thus expected to be observed for even higher values of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 : when @xmath2 is decreased below 0.3 , the results do not give any clear indication about the nature of the phase transition and shows some anomalous behaviour .",
    "a rather uncharacteristic behaviour of the order parameter and the binder cumulant is observed .",
    "the order parameter @xmath31 shows a nonmonotonic behaviour when plotted as a function of @xmath2 with fixed @xmath1 or vice versa ( fig .",
    "[ mag - lamda - del ] ) .",
    "a hump appears in the @xmath31 versus @xmath1 plots for @xmath9 and @xmath91 showing the existence of a local maximum value .",
    "a closer examination reveals that this hump shrinks in size , albeit very slowly , when @xmath30 is increased for @xmath92 ( see inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ mag - lamda - del ] ) and is expected to disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the same is true for the hump appearing in the plot of @xmath31 versus @xmath1 for @xmath93 . for @xmath9 , there are large fluctuations and irregularities in the bc as well which does not allow one to do a finite size scaling analysis and get the exponents .",
    "the irregular behaviour of the bc and the order parameter may be because of the fact that the interactions become less likely to occur as the confidence level is decreased .",
    "for this reason we restrict our study to @xmath94 .",
    "we have estimated , somewhat approximately , @xmath69 for @xmath9 from the crossing point of the order parameter curves for different sizes .",
    "for example , from the data of @xmath31 against @xmath1 for @xmath93 shown in fig .",
    "[ mag - lamda - del ] , we get @xmath95 .",
    "the complete phase diagram in the @xmath96 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - diag ] .",
    "let us try to understand the results by analysing the role of the confidence level @xmath2 .",
    "let the @xmath12th agent with opinion @xmath19 interact with another agent with opinion @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "then , @xmath99    consider the case when @xmath100 is small . on an average ,",
    "when @xmath1 is smaller than 2/3 , the first term will make @xmath19 smaller in magnitude while the contribution of the second term can be neglected",
    ". then we find that @xmath101 as @xmath102 implying the convergence to a neutral state .",
    "since for @xmath37 , it is already known that there is a transition to the neutral state at @xmath33 , we conclude that for any @xmath2 this is the case as is confirmed by the numerical results .",
    "actually , when individual opinions decrease towards zero because of the effect of the first term , the difference in opinions automatically becomes less ( @xmath103 ) so that large and small @xmath2 values have the same effect ; the second term does not contribute eventually .",
    "thus @xmath43 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "what happens at higher values of @xmath1 ?",
    "first consider small values of @xmath2 again which means @xmath104 is small too .",
    "hence the second term still contributes less compared to the first and @xmath19 will retain its original sign in most cases if @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "so it is expected that there will be a region where opinions of both signs are present and @xmath35 , as originally opinions are uniformly distributed with positive and negative signs .",
    "however , if @xmath2 is large , there is no guarantee that the second term is small and opinions will retain their original signs , unless @xmath1 is also very high .",
    "this explains why we observe the transition to the disordered state at a higher value of @xmath1 as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "also , it is not surprising that there will be a ordered region between @xmath105 and @xmath69 ( as already it is known to be present for @xmath106 ) where the lccc property of all opinions assuming the same sign is still valid .",
    "although we have restricted to @xmath94 in the numerical simulations , the case when @xmath2 is exactly equal to zero can be discussed theoretically to some extent .",
    "if an interaction takes place , the opinion for the @xmath12th agent follows the evolution equation @xmath107 this equation is nothing but the dynamical equation obtained for the lccc model in the limit of a single parameter map @xcite , where the transition to an ordered state occurs at a value of @xmath108 .",
    "however , in the present model the above is valid only when there is a second agent with opinion equal to @xmath19 as well .",
    "since this will be extremely rare , effectively most of the opinions remain frozen and the single parameter map is not representative of all the agents opinion evolution .",
    "in fact , @xmath109 may be regarded as a line of discontinuity in the phase diagram of the model in the @xmath3 plane as it will neither have the neutral state nor the ordered state anywhere .",
    "the disordered state is also different in nature for @xmath109 ; here the individual opinion distribution will be flat while for @xmath110 , however small , it is not so .",
    "in summary , we have studied a model of continuous opinion dynamics with an attempt to merge the concepts of confidence level and conviction .",
    "we find the interesting result that with a large value of conviction and with any finite bound on the confidence level ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) , a disordered state exists with tendency to polarisation .",
    "this is indeed justified , if agents are convinced to a large extent in their opinions and interact with like minded people only , the sign of the opinion , ( representing liking / disliking ) is likely to be maintained , giving rise to a polarised society .",
    "the neutral state with all opinions equal to zero remains unperturbed with the introduction of the bounded confidence .",
    "it is found that at least for @xmath88 , the order - disorder transition is first order in nature . for smaller confidence level , when @xmath9",
    ", the ordered phase shrinks to a narrow region of the phase diagram . in conclusion , we obtain a phase diagram with many features when the concept of bounded confidence is incorporated in the lccc model of opinion dynamics .",
    "the overall result is that when bounded confidence level is large , there will be order in the society provided people are not too rigid . in the original dnaw model also",
    ", it had been shown that above a certain confidence level , society behaves more homogeneously .",
    "we show that this tendency remains true but only up to a certain level of conviction .",
    "this seems to be a realistic scenario and thus the combination of concepts from two different models in the present model of opinion dynamics is successful in reproducing this desired feature of a society .",
