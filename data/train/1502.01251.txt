    "a ` universal covering ' is a convex subset of the plane that covers a translated , reflected and/or rotated version of every subset of the plane with diameter 1 . in 1914 , lebesgue @xcite laid down the challenge of finding the universal covering with least area , and since then various other mathematicians have worked on it , slightly improving the results each time .",
    "the most notable of them are j.  pl @xcite , r.  sprague @xcite , and h.  c.  hansen @xcite .",
    "more recently brass and sharifi @xcite have found a lower bound on the area of a universal covering , while duff @xcite showed that dropping the requirement of convexity allows for an even smaller area .",
    "the simplest universal covering is a regular hexagon in which one can inscribe a circle of diameter 1 .",
    "all the improved universal coverings so far have been constructed by removing pieces of this hexagon . here",
    "we describe a new universal covering with less area than those known so far .    to state the problem precisely , recall that the diameter of a set of points @xmath4 in a metric space is defined by @xmath5 we define a * * to be a convex set of points @xmath6 in the euclidean plane @xmath7 such that any set @xmath8 of diameter @xmath9 is isometric to a subset of @xmath6 .",
    "if we write @xmath10 to mean ` isometric to ' , we can define the collection of universal coverings to be @xmath11 the quest for smaller and smaller universal coverings is in part the search for this number : @xmath12    in 1920 , pl @xcite made significant progress on lebesgue s problem .",
    "the regular hexagon in which a circle of diameter @xmath9 can be inscribed has sides of length @xmath13 .",
    "pl showed that this hexagon gives a universal covering , and thus @xmath14 pl then took this regular hexagon and fit the largest possible regular dodecagon inside it , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "he then proved that two of the resulting corners could be removed to give a smaller universal covering .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 ( here and in all that follows , when we speak of ` removing ' a closed set @xmath16 from another closed set @xmath17 , we mean to take the set - theoretic difference @xmath18 and then form its closure .",
    "the universal covers we discuss are all closed . )    in 1936 , sprague went on to prove that more area could be removed from another corner of the original hexagon .",
    "this proved @xmath19 in 1992 , hansen @xcite took these reductions even further by removing more area from two different corners of pl s universal covering .",
    "he claimed that the areas that could be removed were @xmath20 and @xmath0 , but we have found that his second calculation was mistaken .",
    "the actual areas removed were @xmath21 and @xmath22 , showing @xmath23 we have created a java applet illustrating hansen s universal covering @xcite .",
    "this allows the user to zoom in and see the tiny , extremely narrow regions removed by hansen .",
    "our new improved universal covering gives @xmath24 this is about @xmath3 less than the previous best upper bound , due to hansen . on the other hand ,",
    "brass and sharifi @xcite have given the best known lower bound on the area of a universal covering .",
    "they did so by using various shapes such as a circle , a pentagon , and a triangle of diameter @xmath9 in a certain alignment .",
    "they concluded that @xmath25 thus , at present we know that @xmath26    in their book _ old and new unsolved problems in plane geometry and number theory _ , klee and wagon @xcite wrote : 1em    *  it does seem safe to guess that progress on [ this problem ] , which has been painfully slow in the past , may be even more painfully slow in the future . *    1em    however , our reduction of hansen s universal covering is about a million times greater than hansen s reduction of sprague s .",
    "the use of computers played an important role .",
    "given the gap between the area of our universal covering and brass and sharifi s lower bound , we can hope for even faster progress in the decades to come !",
    "let us recall hansen s universal covering @xcite and correct his calculation of its area .",

    "figure similar to the one used by hansen    1em figure 1 shows a regular hexagon @xmath27 in which can be inscribed a circle of diameter 1 . inside",
    "this is a regular dodecagon , @xmath28 .",
    "pl showed that one can take the hexagon , remove the triangles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and still obtain a universal covering .",
    "we generalize his proof in reduction 1 of section [ improved ] .",
    "later , sprague @xcite constructed a smaller universal covering . to do this",
    "he showed that near @xmath31 the region outside the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath32 could be removed , as well as the region outside the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath33 .",
    "we generalize this argument in reduction 2 .",
    "building on sprague s work , hansen constructed a still smaller universal covering .",
    "first he removed a tiny region @xmath34 , almost invisible in this diagram .",
    "then he removed a much smaller region @xmath35 .",
    "each of these regions is a thin sliver bounded by two line segments and an arc , as shown in our java applet @xcite .    to compute the areas of these regions , hansen needed to determine certain distances @xmath36 .",
    "the points and arcs he used , and these distances , are defined as follows :    * the distance from @xmath37 , the midpoint of @xmath38 , to the dodecagon corner @xmath39 is @xmath40 . *",
    "the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath37 is tangent to @xmath41 at @xmath42 and hits the dodecagon at @xmath43 .",

    "the distance from @xmath57 to the dodecagon corner @xmath59 can be seen to equal @xmath55 .",
    "the distance from @xmath59 to @xmath58 is @xmath60 .",
    "here are the two regions hansen removed :    * hansen s first region @xmath61 is bounded by the line segment @xmath62 , the much shorter line segment @xmath63 , and the arc @xmath64 that is part of the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath48 .",
    "he claimed this first region has an area @xmath65 .",
    "this calculation is approximately right .",
    "* hansen s second region @xmath35 is bounded by the line segment @xmath66 , the much shorter line segment @xmath67 , and the arc @xmath68 that is part of the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath53 .",
    "he claimed this second region had an area of @xmath0 .",
    "this calculation is far from correct .    in order to find",
    "the correct areas , we first calculate @xmath40 and then recursively calculate the other distances @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the midpoint of @xmath70 .",
    "recall that @xmath40 is the distance from @xmath42 to @xmath44 , while @xmath45 is the distance from @xmath44 to @xmath43 .",
    "we compute these distances using some elementary geometry . to do this",
    "we must keep in mind some basic facts .",
    "the length of each side of the hexagon is @xmath71 .",
    "the circle inscribed in the hexagon has radius @xmath72 .",
    "the arc from @xmath42 to @xmath43 has a radius of @xmath9 and is tangent to @xmath73 at @xmath42 .    to compute the distance @xmath40 we first need to determine the distance @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the center of the circle , as in figure 1 .",
    "the distance @xmath74 is the distance @xmath76 minus the distance @xmath77 , that is , @xmath78 . since @xmath79 is a 306090 triangle , the length @xmath80 is found @xmath81 times @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath82    knowing @xmath40 we can then calculate @xmath45 . more generally , knowing @xmath69 we can calculate @xmath83 .",
    "the diagram in figure 2 can be used to solve for @xmath83 , and further to calculate the area of the region @xmath84 bounded by the line @xmath85 , the line @xmath86 , and the arc through @xmath87 and @xmath88 that is part of a circle of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath4 .",

    "we let @xmath89 be perpendicular to @xmath91 and @xmath92 and parallel to @xmath93 .",

    "the triangle @xmath100 is a right triangle with @xmath101 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath102 then by applying the pythagorean theorem to the triangle @xmath103 , we see @xmath104 this gives a quadratic relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath83 which can be solved for @xmath83 : @xmath105 to avoid rounding errors we multiply the numerator and denominator by @xmath106 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath107    let @xmath108 be the area of the region @xmath84 bounded by the line segments @xmath85 , @xmath109 and the arc centered at @xmath4 going through @xmath87 and @xmath88 . to compute @xmath108 , we first calculate the area of the triangle @xmath84 and then subtract the area of the region between the line segment @xmath86 and the arc through @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the area of the triangle @xmath84 is @xmath110 the area of the other region is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the angle @xmath113 and @xmath47 is the radius of the circle , namely @xmath90 , which is @xmath9 .",
    "we determine @xmath112 using the formula @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the length of the chord @xmath86 .",

    "this is significantly smaller than hansen s claim of @xmath122 .",
    "there exists a universal covering with area less than or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "start with a regular hexagon @xmath124 with a circle of diameter @xmath9 inscribed inside of it .",
    "pl proved that this is a universal covering @xcite .",
    "let @xmath125 be a regular hexagon of the same size centered at the same point , rotated counterclockwise by an angle of @xmath126 degrees .    when @xmath127 , the case considered by pl , the intersection @xmath128 is the largest possible regular dodecagon contained in the original hexagon @xmath124 . as shown in figure 1 , this dodecagon has corners @xmath28 .",
    "pl proved that if we remove the triangles @xmath29 and @xmath30 from the hexagon @xmath124 , the remaining set is still a universal covering .    we generalize this to the case where @xmath123 is some other small angle  say , less than @xmath129 .",
    "later we shall determine that the optimal value of @xmath123 for our purposes is about @xmath130 .",
    "note that @xmath124 with @xmath131 removed is the union of six triangles @xmath132 shown in figure 3 .",
    "let @xmath133 be @xmath124 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 removed .",
    "we claim that @xmath133 is a universal covering .",
    "to prove this , we generalize an argument due to to pl @xcite .",
    "imagine two parallel lines each tangent to the circle , containing two opposite edges of the rotated hexagon @xmath131 .",
    "any pair of points inside @xmath124 and on opposite sides of @xmath131 have a distance of at least @xmath9 from each other , since the diameter of the circle is @xmath9 .",
    "consider the six triangles @xmath132 .",
    "an isometric copy of any set of diameter @xmath9 can be fit inside @xmath124 .",
    "since the distance between any two triangles that are opposite each other is @xmath9 , this set can not simultaneously have points in the interior of two opposite triangles .",
    "thus , this set can only have a nonempty intersection with three adjacent triangles or three nonadjacent triangles .",
    "in the first case we can rotate the set so that the only triangles it intersects are @xmath136 , @xmath4 and @xmath137 . in the second case",
    "we can rotate it so that the only triangles it intersects are @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in either case",
    ", it fails to intersect the triangles @xmath135 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath133 consisting of the hexagon @xmath124 with these two triangles removed is a universal covering .",
    "recall that a * * is a convex subset of the plane whose * * , defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each having at least one point in common with the sets boundary but none with the set s interior , is independent of the direction of these lines .",
    "vreica @xcite has shown that any subset of the plane with diameter @xmath9 can be extended to a curve of constant width @xmath9 .",
    "thus , a set will be a universal covering if it contains an isometric copy of every curve of constant width @xmath9 .",
    "consider any curve of constant width @xmath9 inside @xmath133 .",
    "it must touch each of the hexagon s sides at a unique point . to see this , note that if it does not touch one of the sides , it would have width less than @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "if it touched a side at two points , then it would have width greater than @xmath9 .",
    "the curve must touch the side of @xmath124 running from @xmath138 to @xmath134 at some point to the left of @xmath139 , the corner of the removed triangle @xmath134 .",
    "this implies that all points near @xmath4 outside an arc of radius @xmath9 centered on @xmath139 can be removed from the closure of @xmath133 , obtaining a smaller universal covering .",
    "similarly , the curve must touch the side of the hexagon running from @xmath135 to @xmath138 somewhere to the right of @xmath140 , the corner of the removed triangle @xmath135 .",
    "thus , all points near @xmath4 outside an arc of radius @xmath9 centered on @xmath140 can also be removed .",
    "the remaining universal covering then has a vertex at the point @xmath52 where these two arcs meet ; for a closeup see figure 4 .",
    "this reduces the area of the univeral covering , but not enough to make it smaller for any nonzero value of @xmath123 than sprague s universal covering , which is the case @xmath141 .",
    "so , we must go further .              * the arc through @xmath37 and @xmath52 is the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath139 , which is a point where the rotated hexagon @xmath125 intersects the original hexagon @xmath124 .",
    "* @xmath52 is the point of intersection of the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath139 and the arc of radius @xmath9 centered on @xmath140 , which is another point where the rotated hexagon intersects the original hexagon .",
    "* @xmath37 is the intersection of the arc centered at @xmath139 with the arc of radius @xmath9 centered on @xmath146 , the midpoint of the edge @xmath147 of the original hexagon .",
    "* @xmath148 is the intersection of the arc with radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath140 and the arc with radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath149 , which is another point where the rotated hexagon intersects the original hexagon .",
    "we claim that the univeral covering considered in reduction 2 can be further reduced by removing the region @xmath142 for a specific angle @xmath123 that we will specify .",
    "( in fact , we could remove the whole of region @xmath150 outside the arcs @xmath151 and @xmath152 and still be left with a set that contains an isometric copy of every curve of constant width 1 . however , this set would not be convex , since it contains @xmath37 and @xmath148 but not points on the line segment between @xmath37 and @xmath148 .",
    "since a universal covering is required to be convex , we only remove the smaller region @xmath142 , one of whose sides is the straight segment @xmath145 . )    to prove our claim , consider figure 5 .",
    "this shows an axis of symmetry of the hexagon @xmath124 going through a point @xmath146 , the midpoint of the side @xmath153 .",
    "when the triangles @xmath154 are reflected about this axis they are mapped to new triangles @xmath155 , some of which are shown in gray in this figure .",
    "to prove our claim , it suffices to show that any curve of constant width @xmath9 can be positioned inside the hexagon with the corners removed at @xmath135 and @xmath134 in such a way that no point enters the region @xmath142 . to show this , we separately consider three cases .",
    "case ( 1 ) is where the curve of constant width @xmath9 enters the interior of triangle @xmath156 .",
    "case ( 2 ) is where the curve does not enter the interior of @xmath156 but it does enter the interior of region @xmath157 .",
    "case ( 3 ) is where the curve does not enter the interior of @xmath156 or @xmath157 .",
    "case ( 1 ) : if a curve of constant width @xmath9 enters the interior of @xmath156 then it can not enter the interior of @xmath158 since all points inside @xmath158 are at a distance greater than @xmath9 from points inside @xmath156 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to show that all points in the region @xmath142 are inside @xmath158 .",
    "this can be checked by calculation for the specific slant angle @xmath123 to be used .",
    "case ( 2 ) : if a curve @xmath159 of constant width @xmath9 enters the interior of @xmath157 then it can not enter the interior of the region @xmath160 .",
    "it must therefore touch the side @xmath161 between @xmath162 and @xmath149 .",
    "it follows that no point inside @xmath159 can lie outside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath149 within the triangle @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , no point of @xmath159 will lie inside the region @xmath142 provided the interior of this region lies outside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath149 .",
    "this condition holds if no points on the segment @xmath145 lie inside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath149 .",
    "this in turn follows from @xmath163 being greater than a right angle .",
    "we shall check this by a calculation for the specific angle @xmath123 we use .",
    "case ( 3 ) : if a curve @xmath159 of constant width @xmath9 does not enter the interior of @xmath156 or @xmath157 then it can be reflected about the axis through @xmath146 and the center of the hexagon , giving a curve @xmath164 also of constant width 1 .",
    "this reflection maps @xmath157 to @xmath134 and @xmath156 to @xmath135 , so @xmath164 will lie inside the hexagon with the two corners @xmath134 and @xmath135 removed .",
    "recall from reduction 1 that @xmath159 has no points in @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "thus @xmath164 has no points in @xmath157 or @xmath156 .",
    "each of the curves @xmath159 and @xmath164 touch the side of the hexagon between @xmath140 and @xmath165 at a single point .",
    "if @xmath159 touches this side between @xmath140 and @xmath146 then @xmath164 will touch this side between @xmath146 and @xmath165 , and vice versa . since reflections are an allowed isometry , we are free to use the curve in either position @xmath159 or @xmath164 , so we choose to use whichever of the two touches the side between @xmath146 and @xmath165 .",
    "no point inside the curve will then lie both outside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath146 and to the left of the line of reflection .    therefore , no point of the chosen curve will lie inside the region @xmath142 provided that no point in the interior of this region lies inside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath146 .",
    "this condition holds if no points on the segment @xmath145 lie inside the arc of radius @xmath9 centered at @xmath146 .",
    "this is turn follows from @xmath166 being greater than a right angle .",
    "we shall check this by a calculation for the specific angle @xmath123 we use .",
    "our computation of the area of the resulting universal covering using java is available online @xcite , along with the output @xcite .",
    "the output lists various choices of @xmath123 , followed by the corresponding values of the area of the would - be universal covering , together with the angles @xmath163 and @xmath166 . we find that when @xmath167 , the area of the universal covering is @xmath168 within the accuracy provided by double - precision floating - point arithmetic . for this value of @xmath123 , @xmath163 is approximately @xmath169 and @xmath166 is approximately @xmath170 .",
    "we could obtain a smaller area if @xmath123 were smaller , but if were too small the constraint that @xmath163 exceed a right angle would be violated .",
