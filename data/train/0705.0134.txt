    "one of the main open problems in asymptotic analysis of linear wave equations is to understand the accuracy of semiclassical approximations for large times .",
    "let @xmath4 be a riemannian manifold and let @xmath5 be the laplace beltrami operator on @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we want to study the long time behaviour of solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath7 with oscillatory initial conditions of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is smooth , @xmath10 is a smooth real valued function and @xmath11 is a small parameter . for small @xmath12",
    "the solutions of can be approximated by a geometric optics like constructions which involves the geodesic flow @xmath13 . by classical results",
    "such approximations work well if one restricts the time to a fixed interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "but the joint limit @xmath0 , @xmath15 is much less well understood , in particular in the case we will be interested in , namely if the geodesic flow is hyperbolic , the accuracy of the approximations are currently only under control if @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a lyapunov exponent associated with the geodesic flow and @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "this time scale is called the ehrenfest time .",
    "rigorous results on propagation of coherent states up to this time have been recently derived in a series of papers , @xcite , and analogous results on egorov s theorem in @xcite .",
    "such results are interesting and useful because the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow become apparent only for large times , and one can use these results to relate the qualitative behaviour of wave propagation for large times and high frequencies to ergodic properties of the geodesic flow .",
    "for instance if the geodesic flow is anosov , it is rapidly mixing and this implies that propagated waves of the form become equidistributed for large times , under certain conditions on @xmath10 , see @xcite .",
    "this is in line with the conjecture that for classically chaotic systems propagated waves should for large times behave universally in the semiclassical limit like random superpositions of elementary plane waves , @xcite .",
    "estimates on time evolution on the scale of the ehrenfest time have as well recently been used to obtain strong estimates on the distribution of eigenfunctions , namely on the entropy of limit measures obtained from sequences of eigenfunctions , @xcite .",
    "but it would be very desirable to understand the behaviour beyond the ehrenfest time .",
    "propagation of waves is a very abundant physical phenomenon and can be observed and measured easily in many different situations .",
    "the ehrenfest time is rather short , and one would like to be able to use semiclassical approximations for much larger times .",
    "in addition to practical applications a better understanding of long time propagation could as well help to approach many open problems about the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues , e.g. , questions like the rate of quantum ergodicity or quantum unique ergodicity .",
    "the accuracy of semiclassical approximations in time evolution has been carefully studied numerically in @xcite for the stadium billiard , and they found no breakdown at the ehrenfest time .",
    "in addition they argued that semiclassical approximations should stay accurate up to a time scale of order @xmath19 , if the classical system has no singularities .",
    "the main problem one faces in the study of semiclassical approximation for chaotic systems is exponential proliferation .",
    "the approximations turn out to be a sum of oscillating terms whose number grows exponentially with time and so they are not absolutely convergent , and the error terms one obtains are of the same nature .",
    "the aim in this work is to show that indeed semiclassical approximations can be valid for times far beyond the ehrenfest time .",
    "we do this by developing techniques to control the size of the error term despite the exponential proliferation .",
    "this is only the first step to understand semiclassical approximations for large time in more detail , because the main term in the approximation is as well a sum of an exponentially growing number of terms , whose behaviour is not easy to understand .",
    "the system we will study is the schrdinger equation on a surface @xmath20 of constant negative curvature .",
    "let @xmath21 be the unit disk , equipped with the usual metric defined by the line element @xmath22 and @xmath23 the laplace beltrami operator on @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath20 can be represented as the quotient of @xmath24 by a group of isometries @xmath25 , @xmath26 and we will assume that @xmath25 is a fuchsian group , i.e. , acts discontinously on @xmath24 , this is equivalent to requiring that @xmath25 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath27 .",
    "the most interesting case is the one where @xmath25 is a fuchsian group of first kind , i.e. , @xmath20 is of finite volume , or even compact .",
    "functions on @xmath20 can be identified with functions on @xmath24 which are invariant under the action of @xmath25 .",
    "we can use summation over @xmath25 to build functions on @xmath20 from functions on @xmath24 : given a function @xmath28 we set @xmath29 which is a function on @xmath20 , provided the sum converges . since @xmath5 commutes with the action of isometries on @xmath24 , the time evolution operator @xmath30 , which is the solution to the schrdinger equation with initial condition @xmath31 , commutes with the action of @xmath25 and we have @xmath32 our strategy will be to construct first semiclassical approximations on @xmath24 and then use this relation to transfer them to @xmath20 .     with examples of horocycles and geodesics associated with @xmath33 .",
    "the dashed circles tangent to @xmath34 at @xmath35 are horocycles and the geodesics emanating from @xmath35 are solid lines .",
    "the horocycles are the wavefronts associated with the phase - function @xmath36 , , and semiclassical wave propagation is described by transport along the geodesic spray emanating from @xmath35 ( which are the projections of trajectories on the unstable manifold associated with @xmath35 ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    let us recall the definition of plane waves associated with horocycles .",
    "let @xmath37 be a point on the boundary of @xmath24 , a horocycle associated with @xmath35 is ( euclidean ) circle in @xmath24 tangent to @xmath34 at @xmath35 , given a point @xmath38 we denote by @xmath39 the unique horocycle associated with @xmath35 which passes through @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore let @xmath41 be the geodesic emanating from @xmath35 and passing through @xmath40 , see figure [ fig : unit - disk ] for illustration .",
    "let us write @xmath42 if @xmath43 lies inside @xmath39 , then given a @xmath37 we can define @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the hyperbolic distance between the two horocycles @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "these function are used by helgason to define a set of plane waves on @xmath24 and develop harmonic analysis , @xcite .    the initial states on @xmath24 we will consider are of the form @xmath46 with a smooth amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "such functions are known as lagrangian states , where the lagrangian submanifold of @xmath47 associated with them is the graph of @xmath48 , @xmath49 this manifold is an unstable manifold of the geodesic flow .",
    "let us denote by @xmath50 the geodesic flow over @xmath24 and by @xmath51 the restriction of the canonical projection @xmath52 to @xmath53 , then we can define an induced flow on @xmath24 by @xmath54 which we can then use to define a one parameter family of operators @xmath55 we will show in lemma [ lem : sl - unitary ] in the the next section that these operators actually form a unitary group .",
    "they are defined purely in terms of the geodesic flow , i.e. , the classical dynamical system associated with the schrdinger equation , and they will give the leading semiclassical approximation to the quantum propagation of an initial state of the form @xmath56 .",
    "let us see how @xmath57 is related to the classical picture of the geometric optics approximation to wave propagation at short wavelength , see , e.g. , @xcite for background . to an initial function @xmath58",
    "one associates the wavefronts which are the level sets of the phase function @xmath10 , the propagated state at time @xmath59 is then of the same form @xmath60 ( provided there are no caustics ) , where the wavefronts of the new phase function @xmath61 are obtained by transporting the initial wavefronts along the geodesics perpendicular to them a time @xmath59 .",
    "this translates via the method of characteristics into a first order equation for @xmath61 , the hamilton jacobi or eikonal equation , and in addition the new amplitude @xmath62 is obtained by transporting the initial one along the same set of geodesics and multiplying it with a factor related to the expansion rate of the geodesics .",
    "now in our case the wavefronts of @xmath36 are the horocycles associated with @xmath35 and these are mapped onto themselves by transport along perpendicular geodesics , so @xmath36 stays invariant ( up to a simple time dependent constant ) , and only @xmath9 is transported , which is exactly described by the action of @xmath57 .",
    "so our first order semiclassical approximation to @xmath63 will be @xmath64 and to show that this is a good approximation even when we project it onto @xmath20 by summing over @xmath25 we have to place some conditions on the amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "[ def : h ] set @xmath65 and let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be functions of @xmath12",

    "we will usually omit the @xmath12-dependence from the notation .",
    "if @xmath70 then the functions in @xmath71 are analytic , and the factor @xmath72 makes them exponentially decaying for @xmath73 , i.e. , by simple sobolev imbedding we have for @xmath74 @xmath75 see lemma [ lem : pointw - est ] .",
    "this exponential decay ensures that the sum over @xmath25 converges , more precisely :    for @xmath76 there is a constant @xmath77 such that @xmath78    a proof of this lemma with the explicit dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath79 will be given in section [ sec : quotient ] , see proposition [ prop : l2-h ] . for our applications we are mainly interested in the exponential decay for @xmath73 of the functions in @xmath71",
    ", the analyticity will be necessary to obtain dispersive estimates in section [ sec : dispersive ] which show that these exponential decay properties are preserved under the action of certain operators .",
    "we can now state a special version of our main result .",

    "we will develop below as well higher order approximations which improve the error term in , but are valid on the same time range .",
    "we will as well make the dependence on @xmath87 explicit which will allow for @xmath12 dependent @xmath87 and @xmath9 .",
    "but before we do so let us outline the main ideas behind the proof of theorem [ thm : main1 ] .    let @xmath88 be defined by @xmath89 this operator is self - adjoint so we can define the unitary operator @xmath90 as the solution of @xmath91 with initial condition @xmath92 .",
    "then we will show in section [ sec : cover ] that @xmath93 this relation is the main tool of our analysis , the propagation of a state on @xmath24 is expressed by the action of the two operators @xmath94 and @xmath90 on the amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "the first one , @xmath94 , induces propagation of the state along geodesics associated with @xmath35 .",
    "the second operator @xmath90 describes dispersion , which takes place on a scale of order @xmath95 , and this is responsible for the error term in .    using the unitarity of @xmath90 and we can rewrite the leading semiclassical approximation as @xmath96 and so @xmath97{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\hbar}\\varphi_b}\\big)$ ] . since @xmath98 commutes with the action of @xmath25 and",
    "is unitary we then find @xmath99_{\\gamma}\\rvert}_{l^2(m ) } = { \\lvert\\big([{v_{b}}^*(t)a - a]{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\hbar}\\varphi_b}\\big)_{\\gamma}\\rvert}_{l^2(m)}\\ ] ] and now the right hand side contains only the dispersive part @xmath90 . then from integrating we get @xmath100 and so @xmath101 which is of order @xmath95 .",
    "so using the unitarity of @xmath98 we got rid of the propagating part @xmath94 which would have lead to exponential proliferation in the sum over @xmath25 and are left with the dispersive part which is easier to control . what we need now to conclude the proof is to show that @xmath102 decays sufficiently fast for @xmath73 so that its sum over @xmath25 is bounded .",
    "to this end we have introduced the spaces @xmath103 , we will show in section [ sec : dispersive ] that for times up to we can control the action of @xmath90 on these spaces well enough to ensure the necessary convergence of the sum .",
    "but as we will discuss further in section [ sec : dispersive ] it is likely that our estimates are not optimal and could be extended to time scales up to @xmath104 .",
    "this would then imply correspondingly larger times in theorem [ thm : main1 ] above and theorem [ thm : main ] below .",
    "we will describe now higher order semiclassical approximations and more refined estimates . to this end",
    "let @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and for @xmath74 set @xmath108 and @xmath109 then our main result is    [ thm : main ] let @xmath80 , where @xmath25 is a fuchsian group , then for all @xmath79 , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 there exist constants @xmath82 , @xmath83 such that for all @xmath74 and @xmath37 , and any @xmath112 , @xmath113_{\\gamma}-u^{(k)}(t)_{\\gamma}\\big]\\big\\rvert}_{l^2(m)}\\leq   c^{n+k+1 } \\frac{n^{2n}k!}{(\\alpha\\hbar)^{2n+4}}\\bigg(\\frac{\\hbar t}{\\alpha^2}\\bigg)^k\\ , { \\lverta\\rvert}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for @xmath114 where @xmath115 is given by .    by choosing @xmath116 optimally one can obtain an exponentially small remainder term .",

    "let us make a couple of remarks about these results .",
    "the @xmath87 dependence : if @xmath87 and @xmath125 are constant , then we have a time range up to @xmath126 .",
    "but we can let @xmath87 depend as well on @xmath12 , this allows to use amplitude functions",
    "@xmath9 which depend on @xmath12 and become , e.g. , localised for @xmath0",
    ". an example would be @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "for @xmath129 this function is in @xmath103 with @xmath130 and @xmath131 and so the semiclassical approximations work at least up to @xmath132 .",
    "this means that we have to have @xmath133 to be able to reach large times .",
    "one can improve this by refining the semiclassical approximations and write @xmath134 when applied to a function localised at @xmath135 as a product of a metaplectic operator times another unitary operator .",
    "this allows to treat coherent states for which @xmath136 , and we hope to discuss this in more detail in the future .",
    "one can as well allow larger spaces than @xmath103 , in particular gevrey type spaces defined by the norm @xmath137 could be useful , because they contain functions of compact support .",
    "for these spaces with constant @xmath87 and @xmath125 we would expect that with the mollification introduced in section [ sec : dispersive ] to be able to control semiclassical approximations up to @xmath138 .",
    "our semiclassical approximations are of the form @xmath139 for some @xmath140 and the action of @xmath141 increases the effective support of @xmath9 at an exponential rate in @xmath59 , so if @xmath25 is a fuchsian group of the first kind then one can show that , even if the sum is absolutely convergent for @xmath142 , we still have @xmath143 so the phase factors @xmath144 are absolutly crucial to ensure uniformly bounded @xmath145-norms for large @xmath59 .    as we mentioned already in the discussion after theorem [ thm : main1 ] our methods can possibly be improved to extend the time range from @xmath3 to @xmath19 . in order to do so we would need some stronger estimates on the action of the operator @xmath134 .    in order to keep the presentation as simple as possible we have restricted ourselves here to two - dimensional manifolds of constant negative curvature , but it should be possible to generalise the results .",
    "the generalisation to higher dimensional manifolds of constant curvature should be straightforward and we expect the same results to hold , in particular the time scales our methods give do not depend on the dimension .",
    "a natural general time scale in semiclassical problems is the heisenberg time @xmath146 which is related to the mean spacing of the eigenvalues , it is the time scale on which the system starts to resolve individual eigenvalues .",
    "we see that the optimal time range we can hope to reach with our methods coincides in two - dimensions with the heisenberg time but is shorter in higher dimensions .",
    "it is not clear if this is an artefact of the method , or some change of behaviour can happen at that time .",
    "since our constructions are mainly of a geometric nature paired with some general analytic estimates on the action of pseudodifferential operators , one should be able to generalise them to riemannian manifolds of non - constant negative curvature .",
    "the phase functions @xmath36 are busemann functions and the operators @xmath141 and @xmath134 together with the decomposition @xmath147 can be constructed in exactly the same way . but some of the ensuing estimates become more complicated since the operator @xmath148 can have coefficients which become highly oscillatory , although with a very small amplitude .",
    "similar results should hold for other hyperbolic problems , e.g. , the standard wave equation and the dirac equation , with oscillatory initial conditions .",
    "the methods developed here can probably be generalised to such cases .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "cover ] we discuss time evolution on the universal cover and prove the decomposition . in section [ sec : quotient ] we study the action of differential and pseudodifferential operators on the spaces @xmath103 and show how they can be used together with sobolev imbeddings to get precise estimates on functions @xmath149 on the quotient in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "we then proceed in section [ sec : dispersive ] to discuss the crucial properties of the action of @xmath150 on @xmath103 , and in section [ sec : proofs ] we finally use the material collected in the previous sections to prove our main theorems and some related results . some auxiliary material on pseudodifferential operators on @xmath24 has been collected in the appendix .",
    "* note on notation * : we will denote by @xmath18 a generic constant which can change from line to line .",
    "we write as well sometimes @xmath151 if there is a constant @xmath82 such that @xmath152 .",
    "it will be useful to choose special coordinates adapted to the phase - function @xmath36 .",
    "since any rotation around the origin is an isometry on @xmath24 , there is an isometry @xmath153 such that @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the point on @xmath34 at @xmath156 .",
    "composing @xmath153 with the standard mapping @xmath157 from the unit disk model to the upper half plane @xmath158 , the geodesics emanating from @xmath35 are mapped to straight lines parallel to the @xmath159-axis and the corresponding horocycles are horizontal lines .",
    "the phase function @xmath36 takes in these coordinates the simple form @xmath160 and in order to keep the notation light we will from now on fix the point @xmath37 and drop the reference to it from the notation .",
    "we recall as well the expressions for the metric @xmath161 , the laplacian @xmath162 and the volume element @xmath163 in these coordinates .",
    "the geodesics emanating from @xmath35 are given in the adapted coordinates by @xmath164 and the flow on @xmath165 induced by shifting with constant speed along these geodesics can be easily seen to be @xmath166 therefore the action of the operator @xmath167 defined in is given in these coordinates by @xmath168    [ lem : sl - unitary ] the operator @xmath169 is unitary and @xmath170 furthermore @xmath171s(t)a\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] i.e. , the generator of @xmath167 is @xmath172 $ ] .",

    "now a short calculation gives @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the generator of @xmath167 from lemma [ lem : sl - unitary ] .",

    "thus we have separated the action of @xmath98 on oscillatory states @xmath58 into two parts .",
    "the part described by @xmath94 is the propagation which is induced by the classical dynamics , note that @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath12 .",
