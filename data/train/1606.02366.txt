    "many biological systems exhibit complex oscillatory dynamics that evolve over multiple time - scales , such as the spiking and bursting activity of neurons , sinus rhythms in the beating of the heart , and intracellular calcium signalling .",

    "further insight into the dynamics of the torus canards in this cell model was presented in @xcite , where a 2-fast/1-slow rotated van der pol - type equation with symmetry breaking was studied . since then",
    ", torus canards have been encountered in several other neural models @xcite , such as hindmarsh - rose ( subhopf / fold cycle bursting ) , morris - lecar - terman ( circle / fold cycle bursting ) , and wilson - cowan - izhikevich ( fold / fold cycle bursting ) , where they again appeared in the transition between spiking and bursting states .",
    "additional studies have identified torus canards in chemical oscillators @xcite , and have shown that torus canards are capable of interacting with other dynamic features to create even more complicated oscillatory rhythms @xcite .",
    "three common threads link all of the examples mentioned above .",
    "first and foremost , the torus canards occur in the neighbourhood of a fold bifurcation of limit cycles , also known as a saddle - node of periodics ( snpos ) , of the fast subsystem ( see figure [ fig : amspiking](b ) for instance ) .",
    "that is , the torus canards arise in the regions of phase space where an attracting set of limit cycles meets a repelling set of limit cycles .",
    "second , the torus canards occur for parameter sets which are @xmath10 close to a torus bifurcation of the full system .",
    "third , in these examples , there is only one slow variable , and the torus canards are restricted to exponentially thin parameter sets . in other words ,",
    "the torus canards in these examples are degenerate .",
    "torus canards in @xmath0 require a one - parameter family of 2-fast/1-slow systems in order to be observed , and they undergo a very rapid transition from rapid spiking to bursting ( i.e. , torus canard explosion ) in an exponentially thin parameter window @xmath10 close to a torus bifurcation of the full system . in principle , the addition of a second slow variable unfolds the torus canard phenomenon , making the torus canards generic and robust .",
    "this is analogous to the unfolding of planar canard cycles via the addition of a second slow variable .",
    "that is , canard solutions in @xmath0 are generic and robust , and their properties are encoded in folded singularities of the reduced flow @xcite .",
    "so far , to our knowledge , the only case study of torus canards in systems with more than one slow variable is in a model for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre - btzinger complex @xcite , which is a 6-fast/2-slow system .",
    "there , the torus canards were studied numerically by averaging the slow motions over limit cycles of the fast subsystem and examining the averaged slow drift along the manifold of periodics . in particular , folded singularities of the averaged slow flow",
    "were numerically identified and the properties of the torus canards were inferred based on canard theory . from their observations , the authors in @xcite conjectured that the average of a torus canard is a folded singularity canard .",
    "this leads to the generic torus canard problem , which can be stated simply as follows .",
    "there is currently no analytic way to identify , classify , and analyze torus canards in the same way that canards in @xmath0 can be classified and analyzed based on their associated folded singularity .",
    "it has been suggested that averaging methods should be used @xcite to reduce the torus canard problem to a folded singularity problem in a related averaged system .",
    "however , this approach is not rigorously justified since the averaging method breaks down in a neighbourhood of a fold of limit cycles , which is precisely where the torus canards are located .",
    "our main goal then is to extend the averaging method to the torus canard regime and hence solve the generic torus canard problem in @xmath1 .",
    "there are three types of results in this article : theoretical , numerical , and phenomenological .",
    "the theoretical contribution is that we extend the averaging method to folded manifolds of limit cycles and hence to the torus canard regime . in so doing , we inherit fenichel theory @xcite for persistent manifolds of limit cycles and in particular , we are able to make use of the powerful theoretical framework of canard theory @xcite .",
    "we provide analytic criteria for the identification and characterization of torus canards based on an underlying class of novel singularities for differential equations , which we call _ toral folded singularities_. we illustrate our assertions by studying a spatially homogeneous model for intracellular calcium dynamics @xcite . in applying our results to this model",
    ", we discover a novel type of bursting rhythm , which we call _ amplitude - modulated bursting _ ( see figure [ fig : ambursting ] for an example ) .",
    "we show that these amplitude - modulated bursting solutions can be well - understood using our torus canard theory . in the process",
    ", we provide the first numerical computations of intersecting invariant manifolds of limit cycles .",
    "the new phenomenological result that stems from our analysis is that we construct the torus canard analogue of a canard - induced mixed - mode oscillation @xcite .    ) .",
    "the amplitude - modulated bursts alternate between active phases where the trajectory ( blue ) rapidly oscillates , and silent phases where the trajectory remains quiescent . during the active phase , the envelope ( red ) of the rapidly oscillating waveform exhibits small - amplitude oscillations which extend the burst duration .",
    "these amplitude - modulated bursts are torus canard - induced mixed - mode oscillations ( section [ sec : tcimmo]).,width=480 ]    earlier reports of torus canards have been seen in the literature , even though that terminology was not used . in @xcite , it was remarked that bifurcation delay may result when a trajectory crosses from a set of attracting states to a set of repelling states where the states may be either fixed points or limit cycles . in @xcite , a canonical form for",
    "subcritical elliptic bursting near a bautin bifurcation of the fast subsystem was studied .",
    "the canonical model consists of two fast ( polar ) variables @xmath11 and a single slow variable @xmath12 . in these polar coordinates ,",
    "the oscillatory states of the fast subsystem may be identified as stationary radii . within this framework ,",
    "torus canards occur as canard cycles of the planar @xmath13 subsystem , and in parameter space they arise in the rapid and continuous transition between the spiking and bursting regimes of the canonical model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sections [ sec : averaging ] and [ sec : classification ] , we give the main theoretical results of the article .",
    "namely , we state the generic torus canard problem in @xmath1 in the case of two fast variables and two slow variables , and then combine techniques from floquet theory @xcite , averaging theory @xcite , and geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite to show that the average of a torus canard is a folded singularity canard . in so doing ,",
    "we devise analytic criteria for the identification and topological classification of torus canards based on their underlying toral folded singularity .",
    "we examine the main topological types of toral folded singularities and show that they encode properties of the torus canards , such as the number of torus canards that persist for @xmath14 .",
    "we then discuss bifurcations of torus canards and make the connection between torus canards and the torus bifurcation that is often observed in the full system .",
    "we apply our results to the politi - hfer model for intracellular calcium dynamics @xcite in sections [ sec : ph ] , [ sec : phtc ] and [ sec : tcimmo ] .",
    "we examine the bifurcation structure of the model and identify characteristic features that signal the presence of torus canards .",
    "using our torus canard theory , we explain the dynamics underlying the novel class of amplitude - modulated bursting rhythms .",
    "we show that the amplitude modulation is organised locally in the phase space by twisted , intersecting invariant manifolds of limit cycles .",
    "these sections serve the dual purpose of illustrating the predictive power of our analysis , and also giving a representative example of how to implement those results in practice .    in section [ sec : explosion ]",

    "we construct the singular attractor of the ph model for @xmath276 m ( figures [ fig : phtoralmmo](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the singular attractor is the concatenation of four orbit segments .",

    "note that the trajectory does not immediately leave the silent phase when it reaches the hopf curve .",
    "dynamic bifurcation theory shows that the initial exponential contraction along @xmath96 allows trajectories to follow the repelling slow manifold for @xmath20 times on the slow time - scale @xcite .",
    "however , there eventually comes a moment where the repulsion on @xmath97 overwhelms the accumulative contraction on @xmath96 and the trajectory jumps away to the invariant manifold of limit cycles @xmath145 .",
    "we have established that for the segments of @xmath36 that are an @xmath20-distance from @xmath33 , the slow drift along @xmath145 is a smooth @xmath10 perturbation of the averaged slow flow along @xmath36 .    in a neighbourhood of the manifold of snpos , and the tfn in particular , we have shown in section [ subsec : phmanifolds ] that torus canards are the local phase space mechanisms responsible for oscillations in the envelope of the rapidly oscillating waveform .",
    "these oscillations are restricted to an @xmath142-neighbourhood of the tfn ( figure [ fig : phtoralmmo](a ) , inset ) .",

    "in fact , the olive solution lies in a different rotational sector than the purple and orange solutions and hence has fewer oscillations .",
    "thus , the amb consists of a local mechanism ( torus canard dynamics due to the tfn ) and a global mechanism ( the slow passage of the trajectory through a delayed hopf bifurcation , which re - injects the orbit into the funnel of the tfn ) .",

    "the other amb rhythms observed in the ph model ( such as in figure [ fig : phampmod ] ) can also be shown to be torus canard - induced mixed - mode oscillations .",
    "the number of oscillations that the envelopes of the ambs exhibit is determined by two key diagnostics : the eigenvalue ratio of the tfn which determines how many maximal torus canards exist , and the global return mechanism ( slow passage through the delayed hopf ) which determines how many oscillations are actually observed .    whilst we have carefully studied the local mechanism in sections [ subsec : phtoralfs][subsec : phtoralfsclass ] and identified the global return mechanism ,",
    "we have not performed any careful analysis of the global return or its dependence on parameters . in particular , the boundary @xmath283 , corresponding to the special scenario in which the singular trajectory is re - injected exactly on the singular strong torus canard marks the boundary between those trajectories that reach the tfn ( and exhibit torus canard dynamics ) and those that simply reach the manifold of snpos and fall off without any oscillations in the envelope . furthermore , the global return is able to generate or lose oscillations in the envelope by re - injecting orbits into the different rotational sectors formed by the maximal torus canards .",
    "we leave the investigation of the global return for these ambs to future work .",

    ", the trajectory can be decomposed into four distinct segments , analogous to the amb rhythm .",
    "the only difference is that the bursting orbit encounters @xmath33 at a regular folded limit cycle instead of a tfn , and so it simply falls off @xmath23 without exhibiting torus canard dynamics .",
    "such a bursting solution , with active phase initiated by slow passage through a fast subsystem subcritical hopf bifurcation , and active phase terminated at an snpo , is known as a subcritical elliptic burster @xcite .",
    "note that in the subcritical elliptic bursting ( figure [ fig : phbifn](b ) ) and amb ( figure [ fig : phbifn](d ) ) cases , the averaged radial - slow flow possesses a repelling ordinary singularity ( i.e. , unstable spiking solutions ) .    in the tonic spiking case",

    "we find that the averaged radial - slow system of the ph model has an attracting ordinary singularity , which corresponds to a stable limit cycle @xmath47 of the layer problem .",
