    "since the observation of the current cosmic expansion speed up through the light - curve of type ia supernovae @xcite , which was confirmed independently by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structures observations @xcite , it became clear that a pure friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology with matter and radiation could not explain all the large scale properties of our universe ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the missing piece was called dark energy and , surprisingly , a single constant , the once despised cosmological constant @xmath0 , was capable of describing its behavior with great success ; being now part of the standard @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , the curious smallness of its energy density ( @xmath1 ) and its lack of correspondence with fundamental physics has raised many questions , and many alternative models have appeared@xcite .",
    "while the cosmological constant always leads to an equation of state ( eos ) parameter for the vacuum with constant value @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , in alternative models its value can vary with time and can be strictly @xmath4 ( e.g. , quintessence @xcite ) , strictly @xmath5 ( phantom energy @xcite ) or cross from one region to another depending on time ( e.g. , quintom @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the possibility of nonlinear eos s is also under current research @xcite .",

    "the possibility of anisotropic dark energy has just started to be evaluated @xcite .    in this work , motivated by the anomalies found in the cmb anisotropies @xcite , which appear to indicate violation of statistical isotropy @xcite , and on the increasing interest on bianchi cosmologies ( for a recent review see @xcite ) ,",
    "we analyze a nondynamical anisotropic form of dark energy which is generated by the usual cosmological constant @xmath0 in combination with a certain parameter @xmath6 . to this end",
    "we employ the bianchi type i line element as the space - time background .",
    "a null @xmath6 corresponds to the usual cosmological constant and hence leads to the usual isotropic cosmology due to the cosmic no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "being @xmath6 non - null , the angular dependence of the hubble parameter does not fade away as the universe expands ; opening the possibility of generating an eccentricity in the last scattering surface @xcite .",
    "this is achieved without the need of others structures and evades problems with isotropization during inflation or during the current epoch dominated by dark energy .",
    "the  price \" of this interesting behavior is violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) ; in particular , this type of dark energy crosses the phantom divide depending on the direction .",
    "some different approaches to cosmology with different types of noncommutativity have appeared @xcite , these are commonly motivated by general quantum - gravity expectations and on the possibility of finding traces of it in the cmb anisotropies @xcite , which are infrared ( ir ) consequences of the original ultraviolet ( uv ) modification @xcite . on the other hand , except for a small fraction of a second , all the universe history is classical and the formation of the last scattering surface occurred when the universe had @xmath7 of its current age ; thus the possibility and consequences of an  infrared noncommutativity \" @xcite , i.e. , a direct modification of the classical space - time canonical structure , should also be verified . here",
    "we show that , in the context of a bianchi i cosmology , the most simple poisson structure deformation that does not violate rescaling of the scale factors evolves in time and admits a natural interpretation as describing a new form of dark energy , precisely the one generated by the anisotropic cosmological constant @xmath8 , where @xmath6 regulates the deformation magnitude .    in the following section we introduce the poisson structure deformation in the bianchi i cosmology , unveiling some of its general features . in sec .",

    "the axial form of the anisotropic cosmological constant here proposed , to second order on the eccentricity , only modifies the quadrupole coefficients and is capable of improving the experimental concordance for the quadrupole power . for higher orders on the eccentricity , as commented in the appendix , the influence to others multipoles is model dependent , but such extension can not induce the observed quadrupole - octopole alignment . in particular , for the presented model , the dipole and the octopole deviations from the @xmath0cdm predictions are exactly null .",
    "it is difficult to conceive a single physical mechanism capable of solving all the cmb anomalies , imprints of physics beyond the @xmath0cdm model probably are related with a fraction of them .",

    "the latter procedure can be pictured as a kind of ir analogue of the scale factor noncommutativity @xcite , it has already been explored in other contexts with constant deformation parameter @xcite .",
    "bianchi cosmologies in the presence of a positive cosmological constant usually isotropize themselves with the universe expansion .",
    "this property was originally welcomed and motivated an interesting discussion on the naturalness of the universe initial conditions @xcite , in particular it opened the possibility that the universe has started under more general conditions than those given by the flrw cosmology and latter evolved to it .",
    "however , as above commented , imprints of some anisotropic ( bianchi ) cosmology were found in the cmb spectrum ; thus , _ a priori _ , being these of true cosmological nature , inflation and/or dark energy need to be fine tuned to do not wipe out the anisotropic imprints .",
    "this issue emerge for instance when considering primordial magnetic fields as a source of current cosmological anisotropies @xcite .",
