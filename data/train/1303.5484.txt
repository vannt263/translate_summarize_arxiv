    "<S> it is by now widely known that the observed luminosity - redshift distribution of type ia supernovae @xcite can be fitted even without dark energy , provided one introduces a sufficiently inhomogenous space - time geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a typical , very simple example of such a possibility is provided by matter - dominated cosmological models of the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) type ( see e.g. @xcite for an incomplete list of papers on this subject ) , provided the observer is located near enough to the symmetry centre of the inhomogeneous  but isotropic  matter distribution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such an example may be regarded as unnatural because of the amount of fine tuning required to localize the observer position @xcite , and also appears theoretically disfavoured by the possible presence of weak geometric singularities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the possible role of inhomogeneities in determining ( or at least substantially contributing to ) the large - scale dynamics should be  and , indeed , currently is @xcite  seriously scrutinized and discussed , even in the presence of a dominant dark - energy cosmic component @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the general question that arises in such a context is how to distinguish different successful analyses of the sne data based on different physical models and , in particular , on different ( homogeneous versus inhomogeneous ) large scale geometries . for inhomogeneous models of the ltb </S>",
    "<S> type various answers to this question are known , concerning the size of the voids described by the ltb geometry @xcite , the local expansion rate inside the voids @xcite , and the associated effect of redshift drift @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other possibilities to test ltb models are provided by studies of scalar perturbations @xcite , of small - scale cmb effects @xcite , of the cosmic age parameter @xcite , and of bao ( baryon acoustic oscillations ) data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this note is to point out another possible difference between inhomogeneous and more conventional interpretations of the sne data , not yet discussed in the literature ; such a difference is based on the value of the redshift parameter @xmath0 ( to be defined below , see after eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 14 ] ) ) , marking the beginning of the regime directly characterized by the kinematic imprints of sne dimming </S>",
    "<S> . the value of such parameter can be largely different even within models able to fit the presently observed luminosity - redshift distributions at a comparable level of accuracy ( see e.g. @xcite for earlier studies on the beginning of the accelerated regime in the context of a homogeneous geometry ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this suggests two possible experimental ways of discriminating among models of the luminosity - redshift relation . </S>",
    "<S> first , direct observations able to extend our present knowledge of the hubble diagram up to values of @xmath1 higher than those allowed by present sne data : for instance , gamma - ray burst ( as discussed in @xcite ) , or even gravitational waves observations , through an analysis of the luminosity distance of the so - called `` standard sirens '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , indirect observations which are sensitive to the time - dependence of the so - called  transfer function \" @xcite , which controls the evolution of the primordial perturbation spectrum inside the horizon down to the present epoch , and which is crucially affected by the kinematics of the cosmological background ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the possible relevance of the parameter @xmath0 will be illustrated in this paper by a simple exercise , in which the sne data of the recent union2 compilation @xcite are fitted using a inhomogeneous , matter - dominated ltb model , and such a fit is compared with the standard one performed in the context of the flat concordance @xmath2 model . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that our aim _ is not _ to provide a realistic alternative to the successful concordance cosmology , but only to discuss how to distinguish , at least in principle , different fits of sne data based on different geometric schemes . the proposed diagnostic </S>",
    "<S> may be added to other general methods aiming at discriminating the expansion history of competing models , like  in particular  dark - energy based diagnostics for homogeneous models @xcite ; a friedmann equation diagnostic for homogeneous versus inhomogeneous models @xcite ; and the already mentioned test of redshift drift @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological configuration we will consider refers to a late - time ( in particular , post - reionization ) universe , characterized by a stochastic distribution of many overdense and underdense regions , of various possible sizes and shapes , possibly even incoherently superimposed among each other . let us suppose that in such a context , and up to a given scale @xmath3 ( to be specified below ) , the effective ( averaged ) large - scale geometry can be _ locally _ described by a model of the ltb type . </S>",
    "<S> such a model is characterized in general by three arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the illustrative purpose of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> however , it will be enough to consider a simple example where the contribution of the spatial curvature is negligible and the gravitational sources are dominated by an isotropic cold dark matter ( cdm ) distribution ( but the model could be easily generalized by the addition of an arbitrary cosmological constant ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the large - scale geometry around a given observer is described  in polar coordinates and in the synchronous gauge  by the following metric , ds^2= dt^2- a^2 ( r , t ) dr^2 - a^2(r , t ) ( d ^2 + ^2 d^2 ) , [ 1 ] where a prime denotes partial derivatives with respect to @xmath4 and a dot with respect to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit @xmath6 one recovers the well known , spatially flat , friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the unknown function @xmath7 is to be determined by the einstein equations , which in our case reduce to h^2 + 2 hf = 8 g ,   2 h+3 h^2=0 , [ 2 ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile of the cdm distribution around a central observer , @xmath10 satisfies the covariant conservation equation : + ( 2h+f ) = 0 , [ 3 ] while all the other einstein equations are identically satisfied by the metric ( [ 1 ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above cosmological equations can be integrated exactly , and in this paper we will adopt the particular exact solution a(r , t)= r ^2/3 , [ 4 ] normalized in such a way that @xmath11 at @xmath12 . the arbitrary function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 depends only on the radial coordinate , and the usual matter - dominated flrw solution is exactly recovered in the limit @xmath14 const . </S>",
    "<S> we will use , in particular , the parametrization h_0(r)= + h e^-r / r_v , [ 5 ] already suggested in @xcite for a similar ltb scenario ( a brief discussion of other possible choices for the phenomenological profile @xmath13 will be given in the final part of this paper ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the chosen profile the combination of parameters @xmath15 corresponds to the locally measured value of the hubble constant , while the distance @xmath3 represents the typical distance scale above which inhomogeneity effects become rapidly negligible .    to make contact with more general forms of the ltb metric appearing in the literature , and expressed in terms of three functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ( we are following the notations of @xcite ) , it may be useful to report here the values of those functions for the model we are using . </S>",
    "<S> the effective gravitational mass with comoving radius @xmath4 , for our solution , is given by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily checked that this function grow like @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while , in the transition regime @xmath23 , it is characterized by a fractal index @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 . the time scale @xmath26  i.e. , the local  big - bang time \" at which @xmath27  in our case is given by @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is important to stress that the obtained solution is consistent with our assumption of vanishing spatial curvature , i.e. with the choice @xmath29 . perturbing the solution with the addition of scalar curvature ( and assuming that @xmath30 as in the large - scale flrw limit ) , we have checked indeed that the curvature contribution to the total energy density may have a variation which is at most of the order of @xmath31 over length scales of order @xmath3 and time scales of order @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> hence , if initially small but nonzero , it keeps small over the whole spatial and temporal range of interest for this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compute the luminosity distance @xmath33 of a source emitting light at a cosmic time @xmath5 and a radial distance @xmath4 from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume , for the moment , that the observer is also located at the origin ( the consequences of a possible off - center position will be discussed later ) . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distance ( or area distance ) of the source , for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) , is then given by @xmath34 , and the luminosity - distance , according to the so - called  reciprocity law \" @xcite , reduces to @xmath35 , where @xmath1 is the redshift parameter evaluated along a null radial geodesic connecting the source to the origin .    </S>",
    "<S> calling @xmath36 the static ( time - like ) geodesic vector field tangent to the worlines of source and observer , and @xmath37 the null vector tangent to the null radial geodesic , we find in our metric @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for light emitted at time @xmath5 , radial position @xmath4 , and observed at the origin at @xmath40 , 1+z= ( k^u_)_r , t(k^u_)_0,t_0= a_0a(r , t ) , [ 6 ] where @xmath41 const .    for the phenomenological applications of this paper we need to express @xmath33 completely in terms of the redshift , namely we need to invert eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) to determine @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we may consider , to this purpose , the differential variation of @xmath1 with respect to the proper time interval @xmath44 separating two different instants of light emission , at fixed observation coordinates : @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that , along a null radial geodesic ( where @xmath46 ) : = dtdddz= -a(1+z ) a ,   drdz= -1a dt dz = -1(1+z ) a. [ 7 ] for the model of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) , in particular , we obtain the differential equations = & - , + = & . </S>",
    "<S> [ 8 ] solving the above equations for @xmath43 , @xmath42 , and inserting the solutions into the explicit definition of @xmath33 , d_l(z)= ( 1+z)^2a(r , t ) = ( 1+z)^2 r(z ) ^2/3 , [ 9 ] we are now in the position of comparing the predictions of our model with the observational data ( as well as with the predictions of the standard @xmath47cdm scenario ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first recall that the union2 compilation of the supernova cosmology project @xcite concerns redshift - magnitude measurements of @xmath48 sne of type ia and provides , for each supernova , the observed distance modulus ( with relative error ) @xmath49 , @xmath50 , for redshift values ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance modulus @xmath53 controls the difference between apparent and absolute magnitude , and is related to the luminosity distance @xmath54 by : [ 10 ] ( z ) = 5 + 25 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 is given in units of mpc , and the constant number @xmath55 is determined by the conventional reference scale assumed for the absolute magnitude .    the luminosity distance of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) , with @xmath13 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) , is characterized in principle by three independent parameters , and can be applied to fit the experimental data by allowing free variations of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed that exercise , and found that the resulting best fit provides for @xmath58 a value very close to @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus chosen to concentrate the present discussion on a simpler , two - parameter fit of the data  which , in any case , is sufficiently accurate for the illustrative purpose of this paper  by imposing on our model the  a priori \" constraint @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> in this way we can eliminate , for instance , @xmath56 , and we can fit the experimental points @xmath49 by performing a standard @xmath61 analysis with [ 11 ] ^2 = _ i=1 ^ 557 ^2 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical values @xmath62 can be determined , for each value of @xmath63 , by numerically integrating the two equations ( [ 8 ] ) , and computing the corresponding @xmath64 as a function of the two parameters @xmath65 . by minimizing the above @xmath61 expression </S>",
    "<S> we have found the best fit values r_v= 3000 497 mpc ,   h= 26.6 1.3 km s^-1 mpc^-1 , [ 12 ] at a confidence level of @xmath66 , and with a goodness of fit @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimization has been performed using the minuit package from cernlib @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the fit is graphically illustrated by the red curve plotted in the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , superimposed to the full set of union2 data ( reported with error bars ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now , for comparison , a fit of the same data performed in the context of a spatially flat flrw geometry , with perfect fluid sources representing cdm and a cosmological constant @xmath47 . denoting with @xmath68 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 the present critical fraction of dark matter and dark energy , we can express the luminosity distance in the usual integral form as d_l(z)= 1+zh_0 _ 0^z dx ^-1/2 [ 13 ] ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> proceeding as in the previous case , we will reduce the number of parameters from @xmath70 to @xmath71 by imposing the same phenomenological constraint as before , which in this case amounts to the condition @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 13 ] ) to compute @xmath73 , and minimizing the corresponding @xmath61 expression , we obtain the best fit values @xmath74 , @xmath75 , at a confidence level of @xmath66 , with @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the fit is illustrated by the blue curve on the right panel of fig . </S>",

    "<S> we present the corresponding best - fit result for a homogeneous @xmath47cdm model , with @xmath77.,title=\"fig:\",height=4 ]    the luminosity - redshift relations of the two models of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] are in good agreement with the data , and in both cases the data points are fitted at a comparable level of statistical accuracy . however , we can disclose an important physical difference between the two fits if we subtract from the distance modulus of the two models the distance modulus @xmath78 of a linearly expanding ( but globally flat ) homogeneous milne geometry ( see e.g @xcite ) , namely if we consider the quantity ( z)= ( z)- ^milne(z)= 5 - 5 , [ 14 ] where @xmath79 is given in units of mpc@xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that positive or negative values of @xmath81 correspond to luminosity distances which are  at a given fixed @xmath1  respectively larger or smaller than the reference values of the milne model .    </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath82 is typical of a decelerated universe like that described by the standard cosmological scenario , where , at the same fixed @xmath1 , the distances are _ smaller _ ( or the received fluxes of radiation , i.e. the apparent magnitudes , are _ larger _ ) than predicted by a linearly expanding model . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath83 , on the contrary , corresponds at the same @xmath1 to _ larger _ distances ( or _ smaller _ radiation fluxes ) than predicted by linear expansion , and is only possible if the model undergoes a period of  effective \" accelerated expansion . in this last case </S>",
    "<S> , the transition across the value @xmath84 defines an epoch  characterized by the parameter @xmath0 such that @xmath85  marking the beginning of the cosmological phase directly imprinted by the kinematic effects of the acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> the plot of @xmath86 is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] for three cases : the standard cdm - dominated ( always decelerated ) model , and the two best - fit models of fig . </S>",

    "<S> we have shown the region allowed by the fit at the @xmath66 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( bounded by dotted lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also reported ( for comparison , and without error band ) the case of the standard cdm model with @xmath87.,height=5 ]    we can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] that @xmath86 is always negative for the cdm model , as expected . for the other two models , instead </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath88 in the redshift range @xmath89 ( because , as expected , a successful fit of the sne data requires the presence of a phase describing  or mimicking  accelerated expansion ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , the values of @xmath0 defined by the condition @xmath90 are largely different in the two models . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in particular , z_acc^ltb=1.07 0.06 ,   z_acc^ = 1.43 0.10 , [ 15 ] and this difference falls outside the error bands illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( it is also much larger than the experimental uncertainty affecting present redshift measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a precise ( near - future ? ) determination of this parameter could provide a clear physical discrimination among different models implementing successful ( and statistically equivalent ) fits of sne data .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned , at this point , that in the computations of the error bands we have neglected the dispersion of data due to the possible presence of a cosmic background of stochastic perturbations : indeed , such a background may induce large errors at very small @xmath1 , but in the range @xmath91 ( typical of @xmath0 ) the induced errors are typically lying in the few - percent range @xcite , hence are not expected to have a crucial impact on the results illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . the same is expected to be true for the systematic errors  possibly slightly bigger than the previous ones , but in any case @xmath92  induced on @xmath93 ( but not on @xmath94 ) by methods of sne data reduction based on the assumption of standard homogeneous cosmology ( and used in particular for the union2 catalogue , see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we should note that a value of @xmath0 compatible with that of the inhomogeneous model considered here could be reproduced also in a homogeneous @xmath47cdm context , with realistic values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , but only at the price of introducing a large enough _ negative _ spatial curvature , with @xmath95 ( for instance , a model with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 gives @xmath99 ) .    in order to stress the importance of the parameter @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider another possible form of the phenomenological profile @xmath13 appearing in the ltb solution ( [ 4 ] ) , for instance the profile h_0(r)= h+ h ( r_0-r2 r ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ 16 ] we can then explicitly check that different models are characterized by largely different values of @xmath0 even within the same class of inhomogenous geometries . by imposing , as before , the phenomenological constraint @xmath100 ( in order to eliminate @xmath56 ) , we find that the new profile ( [ 16 ] ) provides indeed a satisfactory three - parameter fit of the union2 data ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , left panel ) , with best fit values @xmath101 mpc , @xmath102 mpc , @xmath103 , at a confidence level of @xmath66 , with @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding value of @xmath0 for this model ( called @xmath105 in fig . [ fig3 ] ) is significantly different from that of the previous ltb model , and , most important , the behaviour of @xmath86 is exactly the opposite of the standard one , for the range of @xmath1 of our interest ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , right panel ) . </S>",

    "<S> if the observer is located at a distance @xmath108 from the center of a spherically symmetry geometry , the corresponding luminosity distance @xmath33 ( referred to the position @xmath109 ) is no longer isotropic but acquires an angular dependence , and this in turn induces an angular dispersion of the value of @xmath0 which depends on @xmath109 , and which obviously grows ( in modulo ) with the growth of @xmath109 .    </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distance of a source for off - center observers in a ltb geometry has been computed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as a function of @xmath1 , of the distance @xmath109 from the centre , and of the polar observation angle @xmath110 ( referred to @xmath109 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the results of @xcite to compute the directional variation of @xmath0 , at fixed values of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered , in particular , possible displacements from the centre in the range @xmath111 , because  as discussed in @xcite  higher values of @xmath109 would induce a dipole anisotropy too high to be compatible with present cmb observations .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 15 ] ) . for the normalization of @xmath114 we have consistently used @xmath115 , but we have checked that using the fixed value @xmath116 simply rescales the zero of the difference @xmath117 , without affecting the overall amplitude of the dispersion . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , the angular variation of @xmath0 induced by @xmath118 is bounded to be at most at the one - percent level , and has thus a negligible impact on the results of fig .

    "<S> the numerical labels of the curves are referred to the values of @xmath109 , given in units of @xmath113.,height=6 ]    in conclusion , we would like to stress again that the inhomogeneous model discussed in this paper should _ not _ be intended as a realistic alternative to the successful concordance cosmology , but only as a pedagogical example to learn how to distinguish different fits of sne data based on different geometrical schemes . </S>",
    "<S> to this purpose we have shown , in particular , that in the model of this paper the universe enters the regime directly affected the accelerated kinematics _ later _ than predicted by the @xmath47cdm scenario , i.e. @xmath120 . hence , a precise determination of the transition epoch @xmath0 ( possibly through future extensions of the hubble diagram to higher values of @xmath1 , or through indirect studies of the transfer function of primordial perturbations @xcite ) , could help us to physically discriminate among statistically equivalent fits . </S>"
