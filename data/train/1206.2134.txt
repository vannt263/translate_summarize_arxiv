    "<S> an array of superconducting islands with semiconducting nanowires in the right regime provides a macroscopic implementation of kitaev s toy model for majorana wires . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a capacitive coupling between adjacent islands leads to an effective interaction between the majorana modes . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that even though strong repulsive interaction eventually drive the system into a mott insulating state the competition between the ( trivial ) band - insulator and the ( trivial ) mott insulator leads to an interjacent topological insulating state for arbitrary strong interactions . </S>"
