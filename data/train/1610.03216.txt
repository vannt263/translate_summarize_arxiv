    "traditionally , the masses and radii of brown dwarfs and substellar objects have been inferred from applying evolutionary tracks to measurements of their luminosities and ages ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on rare occasions , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars",
    "may transit their binary companions and allow for their other properties to be studied ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a particularly important study was conducted by @xcite , who were able to obtain dynamical masses for 15 brown dwarfs residing in binaries . by comparing the dynamical and photometric masses",
    ", @xcite showed that both the @xcite and @xcite models underpredicted the masses of m and l dwarfs and overpredicted the mass of the lone t dwarf in their sample by @xmath0 ( tens of percent ) . from studying a sample of 46 l dwarfs",
    ", @xcite suggested that a dust haze of sub - micron - sized particles exist in their upper atmospheres , which are neglected by the standard evolutionary tracks .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the traditional approach of using self - consistent evolutionary tracks may be incomplete and motivates alternative and complementary ways of interpreting the spectra of brown dwarfs and substellar objects .",
    "we expect this train of thought to apply to the recently discovered directly imaged exoplanets as well , since the interpretation of their photometry and spectroscopy is typically performed using the evolutionary tracks computed for brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "self - consistent forward modeling starts with a set of assumptions and computes forward to predict the temperature - pressure profile and synthetic spectrum of an object .",
    "atmospheric retrieval is a complementary approach borrowed from the earth remote sensing community , where one applies an inversion method to obtain the temperature - pressure profile and chemical abundances from finding the best - fit solution to the measured spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it sacrifices self - consistency and sophistication for simplicity , which allows for a more thorough exploration of parameter space .",
    "atmospheric retrieval is particularly well - suited for addressing questions regarding planet formation , since it allows for the posterior distributions of the carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( c / o ) and the elemental abundances of carbon ( c / h ) and oxygen ( o / h ) to be computed .",
    "the hr 8799 system hosts four exoplanets @xcite , whose formation mechanisms remain an enigma @xcite .",
    "spectra with resolutions of about 30 to 4000 have been obtained by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . since these spectra have resolutions that are considerably higher than those obtained for hot jupiters using wfc3 on the hubble space telescope ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they present an opportunity for performing remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres that is similar to what planetary scientists had to work with a few decades ago , before the advent of probes .",
    "a key difference is that the radii and masses of these directly imaged exoplanets are unknown , unlike for transiting exoplanets .",
    "a recent review of directly imaged exoplanets , which includes the hr 8799 system , may be found in @xcite .",
    "the first atmospheric retrieval analysis of directly imaged exoplanets was performed by @xcite , who studied only the hr 8799b exoplanet . in the current study",
    ", we collect all of the published spectra of the hr 8799b , c , d and e exoplanets and subject them to the same retrieval method with the intention of using the retrieved chemistry to constrain planet formation scenarios .",
    "besides the novelty of our analysis , the current study is also a method paper for our new atmospheric retrieval code named ` helios - r ` , which we constructed from scratch to study exoplanetary atmospheres . ` helios - r ` is part of the ` helios ` radiation package of the exoclimes simulation platform and has the following features ( figure [ fig : schematic ] ) :    * we have implemented a nested sampling algorithm to explore the multi - dimensional parameter space @xcite . unlike other approaches ( e.g. , markov chain monte carlo , non - linear optimal estimation ) , nested sampling allows for the bayesian evidence to be directly calculated , which in turn allows for models with different parametrizations ( and number of parameters ) to be compared on an equal footing .",
    "models with extra complexity are penalized , which allows for occam s razor to be formally enforced .",
    "for example , our retrieval analysis allows us to formally determine if chemical equilibrium is favored or disfavored in an atmosphere in a completely data - driven manner . as another example",
    ", it allows us to determine the number and types of molecules to be included in the retrieval .",
    "* our temperature - pressure profile is taken from @xcite , who generalized the work of @xcite and @xcite to include non - isotropic scattering and non - constant opacities .",
    "when stellar irradiation and scattering are omitted , the temperature - pressure profile reduces to the classical solution of milne for self - luminous objects @xcite . by construction",
    ", it conserves energy in an analytical and exact sense .",
    "* our atmospheric cross sections are computed using our customized opacity calculator named ` helios - k ` , which was previously published by @xcite . * to combine the cross sections of different molecules , one needs to have a chemistry model that calculates their relative abundances .",
    "we use the analytical solutions of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which have been shown to be accurate at the @xmath1 level ( or better ) when benchmarked against numerical solutions using gibbs free energy minimization .",
    "these analytical solutions allow for fast computation if one wishes to enforce chemical equilibrium .",
    "* our radiative transfer scheme , which translates cross sections and temperatures into fluxes ( and hence allows us to compute the synthetic spectrum ) , uses the exact analytical solution in the limit of isothermal model layers and pure absorption @xcite .",
    "it allows us to analytically integrate over all of the incoming and outgoing angles associated with every ray .",
    "* our cloud model is based on the basic principles of mie theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it assumes a monodisperse set of particles , which may be interpreted as the dominant size in a size distribution of particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it includes a dimensionless parameter that is a proxy for the cloud composition .",
    "when the particles are small compared to the wavelength , it reproduces rayleigh scattering .",
    "by contrast , models that implement a constant cloud - top pressure implicitly assume the cloud particles to be large ( compared to the wavelength observed ) and preclude rayleigh scattering by construction .",
    "while each component of ` helios - r ` may not be novel by itself , the assembly of all of these components into a single code and retrieval tool is a novel endeavor .",
    "furthermore , we have designed ` helios - r ` to run on graphics processing units ( gpus ) , which affords speed - ups of at least a factor of several compared to the cpu version . with a ucrg model ( see table 1 ) retrieval performed on the hr 8799b dataset , the gpu version is 5 times faster than the cpu version on a macbook pro laptop equipped with a nvidia geforce gt 750 m gpu card and an intel core i7 2.5 ghz cpu . for this analysis",

    "+    we first distinguish between our use of the terms  cross section \" and  opacity \" .",
    "the former has units of area .",
    "the latter is the cross section per unit mass .",
    "we previously designed and wrote an open - source opacity calculator @xcite , based on implementing algorithm 916 @xcite to perform fast computations of the voigt profile by recasting it as a faddeeva function . typically , ` helios - k ` is able to compute an opacity or cross section function with @xmath6 spectral lines in @xmath7 s on a nvidia k20 gpu . in principle , it is agnostic about the spectroscopic line list being used and is able to take any line list as an input .",
    "the details of how to take the inputs of a line list and use them to compute the integrated line strengths and line shapes have previously been summarized in @xcite and we will not repeat them here .    we restrict ourselves to only four molecules : carbon monoxide ( co ) , carbon dioxide ( co@xmath8 ) , water ( h@xmath8o ) and methane ( ch@xmath9 ) . for the first three molecules , we use the hitemp database @xcite . for methane",
    ", we use the hitran database @xcite , which may be considered a shortcoming as the weak methane lines are missing from hitran .",
    "the weak methane lines are not expected to play a major role at the temperatures typical of the infrared photospheres of the hr 8799 exoplanets ( @xmath101000 k ) , compared to the photospheres of hot jupiters that have temperatures of 15002500 k. @xcite report methane to be subdominant in hr 8799b compared to water and carbon monoxide .",
    "acetylene , ammonia , ethylene and hydrogen cyanide have been omitted , because they are subdominant at the photospheric temperatures of the hr 8799 exoplanets @xcite .",
    "in particular , see figure 10 of @xcite .    in the current study , we choose to deal with cross sections instead of opacities . for our ` helios ` self - consistent radiative transfer code , we chose to use opacities instead .",
    "there are various strategies to construct the cross section function of the atmosphere . by",
    " cross section function \" , we refer to the function that depends on temperature , pressure , wavenumber and type of molecule .",
    "the cross section function is a theoretical construction : it may be defined continuously or be sampled at an arbitrary number of points .",
    "we consider the way in which the cross section function is sampled as an issue of implementation , which we will now discuss .",
    "regardless of the approach used to construct and sample the cross section function , the end goal is the same : to use them to construct transmission functions and ultimately integrate fluxes over a waveband .",
    "the first approach is to use the  k - distribution method \" , which resamples the highly erratic cross section function into a monotonically increasing cumulative distribution function @xcite .",
    "since the k - distribution method is only exact for a homogeneous atmosphere with one molecule @xcite , one has to apply the  correlated - k approximation \" as well , which assumes that the spectral lines are perfectly correlated ( see chapter 4.4.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the second approach is to use  opacity sampling \" , which is to discretely sample the opacity function , typically at a smaller number of points than there are lines . in our context , it is perhaps more accurate to term it  cross section sampling \" .",
    "the  line - by - line \" limit occurs when the integrated fluxes over a waveband is exact ( to machine precision ) .",
    "it is essentially the second approach , but where the cross section function is sampled at more wavenumber points than there are lines .",
    "since there are @xmath11 ( or more ) lines for the water molecule alone , this is a formidable computational challenge and is currently infeasible for any retrieval code dealing with hot exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "we note that a cross section function that includes all of the lines of a given line list does not qualify it as being ",
    "line by line \" , if the sampling is not fine enough to resolve each line profile .    in the current study",
    ", we adopt the second approach , which is also used by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our spectral resolution used is 1 @xmath12 , evenly sampled across wavenumber .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite also used a spectral resolution of 1 @xmath12 .",
    "some authors do not specify the spectral resolution of their atmospheric cross section function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we precompute our cross sections on a grid across wavenumber , pressure and temperature : 100 to 2900 k ( in increments of 200 k ) and 1 @xmath13bar to 1 kbar ( with two points per dex in pressure ) for co , co@xmath8 , ch@xmath9 and h@xmath8o .",
    "a lingering issue , which stems from an unsolved physics problem , is that the far line wings of voigt profiles do not accurately represent the wings of real lines .",
    "various groups have adopted different ad hoc approaches to truncating the voigt profiles ( see @xcite and references therein ) . @xcite",
    "discuss this issue , but do not provide any solution for it . in the current study , we adopt a 25 @xmath12 line - wing cutoff for water and a 100 @xmath12 cutoff for the other three molecules .              once the cross sections have been computed , they may be used to compute the optical depth , of each model layer , for all of the molecules , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mixing ratio and cross section of the @xmath17-th molecule , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the thickness of the layer in terms of the difference in pressure .",
    "the mean molecular mass is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath13 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath20 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "the preceding expression assumes hydrostatic equilibrium , isothermal layers and that the surface gravity is constant throughout our model atmosphere .",
    "generally , the mixing ratios of molecular hydrogen and helium only show up via cia as a contribution to the continuum of a spectrum , which implies that they can not be as definitively determined as that of the molecules .",
    "our cia opacities are obtained from @xcite . in the range of @xmath210.9 ,",
    "the effect on the continuum of the synthetic spectrum is very similar ( not shown ) .",
    "the effects of h@xmath8-he cia are even more subtle . as such , we adjust @xmath22 to render the sum of the mixing ratios unity , @xmath23 where we have assumed that @xmath24 to reflect cosmic abundances . by denoting the mass of the @xmath17-th molecule by @xmath25 ,",
    "the corresponding mean molecular weight is calculated using @xmath26 for example , if we have @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then we have @xmath30 . in models with equilibrium chemistry ,",
    "the mean molecular weight changes slightly for each layer .    in the current study",
    ", we consider two chemistry models .",

    "equilibrium chemistry \" means that the @xmath15 may be determined using only the elemental abundances of carbon ( @xmath31 ) and oxygen ( @xmath32 ) , if c - h - o gaseous chemistry is considered . in this case",
    ", the 4-parameter system of unconstrained chemistry reduces to 2 parameters . to compute the four @xmath15 values given @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we use the validated analytical formulae of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . specifically , we implement equations ( 12 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) of @xcite for gaseous c - h - o chemistry .",
    "the benchmarking of these formulae against calculations of gibbs free energy minimization was previously performed by @xcite , who showed that they are accurate at the @xmath1 level or better .",
    "further validation of these formulae comes from matching the trends found by @xcite and @xcite .    for unconstrained chemistry ,",
    "the carbon - to - oxygen ratio is computed using @xmath33 the elemental abundances are then inferred using @xmath34 each mixing ratio is assumed to be constant over the entire model atmosphere .",
    "the alternative , which is to have a different value of the mixing ratio for each of the 100 model layers we assume , would result in 400 free parameters .",
    "this is unwarranted given the sparseness of the data , i.e. , we have less than 400 data points .    for equilibrium chemistry ,",
    "the carbon - to - oxygen ratio is simply @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fitting parameters of the retrieval .",
    "since the mixing ratios of all of the molecules can be exactly specified for each layer , which has its own temperature and pressure , the assumption of constant mixing ratios across height / pressure is unnecessary for the models with equilibrium chemistry .",
    "the 400 values of the mixing ratios are specified by just two free parameters : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    unlike in previous studies",

    "a more sophisticated radiative transfer scheme needs to account for both the fluxes incident upon a layer and the thermal emission associated with the layer itself , since each layer has a finite temperature . to this end",

    "third , by adapting and degrading the mock spectrum to the data resolution and spectral coverage of hr 8799b and hr 8799e , we may study the effects of incomplete or sparse data on the retrieved molecular abundances .",
    "the key difference between the currently available data for hr 8799b and hr 8799e is that the latter does not have k band spectroscopy .",
    "figure [ fig : mock ] shows the outcomes of these tests .",

    "surprisingly , our ability to recover these input values appear to be insensitive to whether the mock spectrum is degraded or not ( first row , second and third columns ) , if @xmath46 and @xmath80 are known .",

    "8799e - like data coverage , we see clear signs of degeneracies being introduced into the posterior distributions .",

    "[ subsect : main ] .    allowing the surface gravity to be a fitting parameter has more serious consequences , as it introduces degeneracies into all of the other fitting parameters ( second row of figure [ fig : mock ] ) .",

    "it suggests that an informative prior needs to be set on the surface gravity .",

    "it suggests that the c / o is a robust outcome of the retrieval .",

    "[ subsect : priors ] , we will argue for setting gaussian priors on @xmath83 as well as @xmath46 when analyzing real data from the hr 8799 exoplanets .",
    "the strongest demonstration of why our assumptions for the prior distributions of input parameters are important comes from examining a model where the radius and surface gravity are implemented as uniform priors in the retrieval .",
    "specifically , we perform a retrieval on the measured spectrum of hr 8799b using model ubrg in figure [ fig : radius ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath80 are specified as uniform priors .",
    "we see that the retrieved solution is @xmath84 , which is physically unreasonable .",
    "the surface gravity ( @xmath83 ) is unconstrained . as we have learned from the mock - retrieval exercises in  [ subsect : mock ] , these difficulties stem from specifying the radius and surface gravity as unconstrained fitting parameters .",
    "we now discuss why the values for @xmath46 are physically unreasonable .",
    "there are indirect arguments for why retrieved solutions with radii well below a jupiter radius should be rejected .",
    "first , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars with masses between 20 and 100 jupiter masses have transit radii that are at least @xmath85 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , including corot-3b , which is a low - mass brown dwarf with a dynamical mass of @xmath86 and a transit radius of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "second , a review of the data for all of the transiting jupiter - like exoplanets reveals also that objects with radii below @xmath85 do not exist ( figure [ fig : radii ] ) .",
    "when a cut is made to only include objects with zero - albedo equilibrium temperatures below 1000 k ( to exclude objects that are  inflated \" by some unknown mechanism related to stellar heating , e.g. , @xcite ) , we find that the radii are bound between 0.8 and @xmath88 .",
    "the single outlier with @xmath89 is kep-447b , which has an extremely grazing transit @xcite that may render its radius measurement unreliable .",
    "third , objects with a mass of jupiter ( or higher ) are partially degenerate and it is theoretically challenging to get their radius to be less than that of jupiter s @xcite .    while it may be tempting to fix our model radius at between 0.8 and @xmath90 , we should be reminded of the fact that these radii are measured for @xmath91 gyr - old objects , whereas the hr 8799 exoplanets are estimated to be @xmath92100 myr old . guided by evolutionary models @xcite , we set @xmath93 as a gaussian prior of our retrievals .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath94 is the full - width at half - maximum of the gaussian .",
    "we note that @xcite assume @xmath95 for their self - consistent model of hr 8799b .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : radii ] is also revealing , as it shows the measured surface gravities of transiting jupiter - sized exoplanets to be hovering around @xmath96 for objects with masses of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the mass of jupiter .",
    "since we expect the hr 8799 exoplanets to have radii that are slightly larger than jupiter s , we expect their surface gravities to also be @xmath96 .",
    "surface gravities of @xmath995.0 are only appropriate when one crosses over into the brown dwarf regime ( @xmath100 ) , e.g. , corot-3b has @xmath101 .",
    "the photometric masses of hr 8799b , c , d and e are less than half that of corot-3b @xcite .",
    "based on the evolutionary calculations of @xcite , who estimated @xmath10213 @xmath98 for the hr 8799 exoplanets , we set a gaussian prior of @xmath103 on the surface gravity ( taking into account @xmath93 ) .",
    "this range of surface gravities is somewhat higher than the @xmath104 values considered by @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we find that what we assume for the prior distributions of the input quantities is critical to the outcome of the retrieval .",
    "uninformative priors may not always be the best choice as they may lead to unphysical or even nonsensical outcomes .",
    "gaussian priors are better choices in these instances , but only when they are guided by physics .",
    "we find our retrievals to be physically meaningful only when gaussian priors are set on the radius and surface gravity , which is a departure from the hr 8799b analysis of , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "traditionally , model selection is performed manually by the modeler or theorist .",
    "one starts with a set of assumptions , computes forward and arrives at a prediction for the thermal structure and synthetic spectrum .",
    "these assumptions include chemical equilibrium or disequilibrium , a value for the strength of atmospheric mixing , the number of atoms and molecules included in the model , the metallicity and c / o , etc .",
    "other assumptions are more closely related to technique , e.g. , the approximate or limiting form of the radiative transfer equation being solved .    like all of the other previous studies involving both forward modeling and retrieval",
    ", we inevitably make a set of both physical and technical assumptions .",
    "however , we use our nested sampling approach to go a step further : we compute the bayesian evidence for models with and without equilibrium chemistry .",
    "we then compare them in order to formally quantify whether equilibrium chemistry is a warranted assumption . instead of assuming a fixed set of cloud parameters for each retrieval , as was done by @xcite , we allow our cloud model to be part of the retrieval and",
