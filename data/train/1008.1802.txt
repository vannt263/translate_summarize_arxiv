    "the ground state equilibrium volumes were measured to be 28.17 @xmath11 for the @xmath0-ce and 34.36 @xmath11 for the @xmath1-ce.@xcite the most apparent difference between these two phases is that the lattice parameter of the @xmath1-phase is larger than that of the @xmath0-phase . to authenticate whether the degree of 4f hybridization with other valence states can cause this change in lattice parameter ,",
    "we have applied the lda+u method@xcite to the @xmath1-phase and used the pbe - gga@xcite for the @xmath0-phase . the spin - polarized pbe - gga including spin - orbit coupling ( gga+sp+so ) result shows an excellent agreement between our calculated lattice parameter , 4.808  , with experiment , 4.830 ,@xcite for the @xmath0-phase .",
    "the later obtained excellent agreement using solely the gga+sp+so , with no further band correlated corrections , can be taken as an indication to the fact that the 4f @xmath0-ce electrons tend to behave as band - like itinerant electrons in agreement with mott transition ( mt ) scenario.@xcite the gga+sp+so plus correlations ( gga+sp+so+u ) among 4f ce electrons has been used with literature values of 6.1 ev@xcite and 4.4 ev@xcite for the hubbard u parameter in the @xmath1-phase .",

    "insofar as the accuracy of our surface calculations are concerned , our success in reproducing bulk properties may not seem to be sufficient .",
    "thus , we would second offer an estimation concerning the accuracy of our surface calculations by reporting on the work function as an extremely surface sensitive quantity@xcite .",
    "therefore , we have also calculated the work function , @xmath15 , as the minimum energy required to liberate an electron from the fermi level ( @xmath16 ) to a point with negligible kinetic energy at the center of the vacuum of the slab .",

    ".  [ fig2 ] , is more reliable than that of the @xmath0-phase .",
    "fluctuation of the @xmath0-phase between fourth and fifth layers shows also a small change of about 2% in the work functions .",
    "the result , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , indicates that the fluctuation of the work function is not substantially affected by the spin - orbit coupling and/or lda+u correlations .",
    "the result shows that the work function oscillate as a function of the number of layers with the period of @xmath19 layers .",
    "the oscillation indicates how the quantum size effects ( qses ) @xcite can affect the results .",
    "the period of oscillation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is less than the period of the `` abcabc '' pattern of the fcc stacking .",
    "this can be taken as an indication to the fact that here oscillations of the work function originates more dominantly from the quantum size effects ( qses ) at nanoscale than the period of thin films stacking due to the symmetry of the structure@xcite .",
    "our result shows that the work functions of the @xmath1-phase are larger than those of the @xmath0-phase , for every number of layers .",

    "such a contradictory situation in these isostructural phases concerning different magnetic behaviors of their bulks when compared with their free ( 111 ) surfaces can be considered as another physical property for cerium .",

    "this represents another success of the density functional theory ( dft ) in fundamentally predicting complicated 4f - electron nanosystems from first principles of quantum mechanics without assuming any experimental data .",
    "it is to some extent hard to expect that there can be found another case in nature similar to cerium with two isostructural phases and opposite magnetic surfaces compared to their corresponded bulk counterparts .",

    "thereby , ce once more serves as an interesting case to appraise the validity of our fundamental understanding based on the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "from our hypothetical freestanding surface study one may also deduce that a lattice mismatch at the interface with a typical unreactive and non - diffusive substrate can play an important role on the magnitude of the magnetic moments in ce thin films .",
    "the sensitivity of cerium thin films to the effects of lattice mismatch can be inferred by the fact that the differences between @xmath0- and @xmath1-phases may be resulted from the larger lattice parameter of the @xmath1-ce than that of the @xmath0-ce .",
    "the unreactive and non - diffusive substrate affects the lattice mismatch of the cerium overlayers .",
    "the lattice mismatch at the interface of a typical ce(111)/substrate causes to change lattice parameter of the cerium thin films .",
    "the change of lattice parameter in ce can give rise to transition from @xmath0- to @xmath1-phase .",
    "in uncorrelated thin films the change of lattice mismatch to some extent may not drastically change the electronic structures .",

    "for instance , the effects of gold and cooper substrates on the ferromagnetic transition metals were refuted in leading to magnetically dead layers.@xcite lattice mismatch on cerium is important not only due to its 4f - electrons , but also more importantly due to existing isostructural @xmath0- and @xmath1-phases in the vicinity of each other .",
    "this point might be of significant importance in nanotechnology , as in this case one can control the surface magnetic moments ranging from enhanced magnetically ordered surfaces to magnetically dead layers by changing unreactive and non - diffusive substrates .",
    "therefore , we predict that more lattice mismatch in @xmath0-ce thin films can give rise to less magnetic surface .",
    "the magnetic surface of @xmath0-ce thin films can suddenly disappear by increasing lattice mismatch towards lattice parameter of @xmath1-ce .",

    "<S> it is well known that the surface of nonmagnetic @xmath0-ce is magnetically ordered , i.e. , @xmath1-like . </S>",

    "<S> nonetheless , our result shows that the ( 111)-surfaces of magnetic @xmath1-ce are neither spin nor orbitally polarized , i.e. , @xmath0-like . therefore , we predict , in contrast to the nonmagnetic @xmath0-phase which tends to produce magnetically ordered @xmath1-like thin layers at its free surfaces , the magnetic @xmath1-phase has a tendency to form @xmath0-like dead layers . </S>",
    "<S> this study , which explains the suppressed ( promoted ) surface magnetic moments of @xmath1-ce ( @xmath0-ce ) , shows that how nanoscale can reverse physical properties by going from bulk to the surface in isostructural @xmath0- and @xmath1-phases of cerium . </S>",
    "<S> we predict using our freestanding surface results that a typical unreactive and non - diffusive substrate can dramatically influence the magnetic surface of cerium thin films in contrast to most of the uncorrelated thin films and strongly correlated transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> our result implies that magnetic surface moments of @xmath0-ce(111 ) can be suddenly disappeared by increasing lattice mismatch at the interface of a typical unreactive and non - diffusive substrate with cerium overlayers . </S>"
