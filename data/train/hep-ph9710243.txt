    "in 1982 , the european muon collaboration at cern discovered in the muon - nucleus deep inelastic scattering(dis ) that the structure functions @xmath2 of bound nucleon is quite different from that of free nucleon within the region @xmath3@xmath4}$ ] , this nuclear effect was thus called the emc effect . since the discovery of the emc effect",
    ", physicists have proposed several models and made out more or less satisfactory explanation for it @xmath5}$ ] .",
    "but , for the shadowing effect emerged within very small x region in dis process @xmath6}$ ] and the a - dependence of the differential cross section of h - a drell - yan process @xmath7}$ ] , only the constituent quark model , @xmath0- rescaling model @xmath8}$ ] and the extended x - rescaling model @xmath9}$ ] , after introducing the nuclear shadowing factor , can make out satisfactory explanation .",
    "in addition , only the three models mentioned above have made out quantitative description for @xmath1 photoproduction on the nuclear target .",
    "+ in the @xmath0-rescaling model with shadowing factor , except for the parameter relative to shadowing , for the distribution functions of valence quark , sea quark and gluon within the bound nucleon , a common @xmath0-rescaling parameters @xmath10 was employed .",
    "although the model can explain several kinds experimental processes mentioned above , but as pointed by li guanglie et .",
    "al.@xmath9}$ ] it leads to non - conservation of nuclear momentum , that is , the momentum of a nucleus is no longer equal to the sum of momenta of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons including in the nucleus .",
    "they thought that for the valence quark distribution and sea quark distribution , two different @xmath0-rescaling parameters should be employed .",
    "+ as a phenomenological approach to investigate the parton distribution functions of a bound nucleon , here we presented a model , in which three @xmath0-rescaling parameters were employed for the distributions of valence quark , sea quark and gluon respectively , and the artificial shadowing factor was not used .",
    "due to restriction of nuclear momentum conservation , only two among the three parameters are independent",
    ", so we call this model the double @xmath0-rescaling model(d@xmath0rm ) .",
    "+ from large amounts of available experimental data , it can be seen that for the both of free nucleon and bound nucleon , the x distribution and its evolution with @xmath0 of valence quarks are quite different from those of sea quarks and gluons , the distribution of valence quarks is mainly restricted within the region of @xmath11 , the `` hardness '' of the distribution allows one to imagine that the valence quarks are confined within a bag with a distinct boundary and the behavior of its evolution is described by glap equation @xmath12}$ ] . the emc effect mentioned above",
    "mainly reflects the change of valence quark distribution of bound nucleon as compared with free nucleon .",
    "for the distributions of sea quark and gluon , however , the case is much complex . the distribution of sea quark and gluon mainly restricted within the region of @xmath13 , and quickly increases with x decreasing .",
    "the case is more obvious for the gluon distribution .",
    "therefore , they play dominant role in the region of very small x@xmath14}$ ] . as well known , the longitudinal size of parton with momentum fraction x is @xmath15 , p is the momentum of nucleon in a certain frame of reference with high speed , then usual picture that partons are confined in a colour bag becomes indistinct . in relation with the case , soft partons with very small x value from adjacent nucleons lying in the same longitudinal line within nucleus may penetrate and overlap each other . the smaller x value , and the larger the atomic number a , the more outstanding the phenomena .",
    "then , recombination or fusion between two or several partons from different nucleons could occur .",
    "the partons with very small x recombine and form into a parton with slightly larger x , and this process naturally leads to the shadowing in very small x region and antishadowing in slightly larger x region , thereby , after taking into account the recombination , the artificial shadowing factor is not needed .",
    "+ based on above mentioned understanding , we present d@xmath0rm . using this model , the influence of nuclear environment on the parton distributions and the experimental data on l - a dis process , h - a drell - yan process and @xmath16-a @xmath1 production can be consistently and satisfactorily explained .",
    "in contrast with the rescaling parameter @xmath17 of valence quark distribution is larger than unity and slowly increases with a increasing , a characteristic feature of our model is that both the rescaling parameters @xmath18 of sea quark distribution and @xmath19 of gluon distribution are smaller than unity and slowly decrease with a increasing .",
    "this feature just right meets the needs of the @xmath0 evolution picture of parton distributions in small x region of bound nucleon and nuclear momentum conservation .",
    "we shall present experimental support for this feature in the section 3 .",
    "for a nucleus a , our model assumes three different @xmath0 -rescaling parameters for the distributions of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons in the bound nucleon respectively : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where i denotes the flavor of quark .",
    "that is to say , the distributions of various partons of bound nucleon may be obtained by @xmath0 rescaling for the distributions of corresponding partons of free nucleon .",
    "for all of nuclei and any @xmath0 values , the momentum conservation condition @xmath24+g^{a}(x , q^2)\\}}=1.\\ ] ] should be respected .",
    "because of the restriction of formula(2 ) , only two among three @xmath0-rescaling parameters are independent , so this model is called the double @xmath0-rescaling model .",

    "+ the nuclear effect of the nucleon structure function and gluon distribution may be represented by following ratios : @xmath29 @xmath30 usually , these ratios calculated by a certain theoretical model are used to compare with the experimental data .",
    "+ for the drell - yan process in p - a collision , the nuclear effect is represented by the ratio @xmath31 where @xmath32 { \\bar q}_{si}^{a}(x_t , q^2)\\ ] ] @xmath33\\},\\ ] ] @xmath34 { \\bar q}_{si}^{n}(x_t , q^2)\\ ] ] @xmath35\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the invarint mass of lepton - pair(@xmath37 ) produced in the process .",
    "+ three @xmath0-rescaling parameters @xmath38 and@xmath39 are determined by the following method : firstly , we choose suitable @xmath40 and@xmath41 to explain the nuclear effect in l - a dis process ; secondly , we describe p - a drell - yan process with the same values of @xmath40 and @xmath42 to test them , and finally determine @xmath43 using nuclear momentum conservation and explain the nuclear effect of @xmath1 photoproduction process at nuclear target . + for the parton distribution function of free nucleon , we adopt the parton momentum distributions given by m.gluck , e.reya and a.vogt(grv)@xmath44}$ ] , because this formalism allows to be evoluted inversely to @xmath45 .",

    "+ at present , the statistics and the precision of experimental data on l - a dis process , h - a drell - yan process and @xmath48 j/@xmath49 production process is insufficient to test very precise theoretical calculation , so that in our calculation , only the leading order approximation on the formulas of hard subprocesses and parton distribution functions are considered .",
    "+ the @xmath0-rescaling parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 on nuclei @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 obtained by above method from the data of references[3 , 4 , 10 ] are listed in the table 1 .",
    "it is worth to note that , all of @xmath50 are larger than unity and increase with a increasing , but all of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are smaller than unity and decrease with a increasing . in the next section , we shall present a experimental evidence supporting this result",

    "furthermore , using formulas ( 5)-(9 ) , the theoretical predictions on @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 by the double @xmath0-rescaling model are calculated .",

    "we can see that our results are in qualitative agreement with the data , and especially in the region of @xmath68 , the agreement is quite satisfactory .",

    "it can be seen that slope of these curves slowly increasing with a increasing .",
    "this case reflects that the influence of gluon recombination is enhanced with a increasing .",
    "+ in the following paragraphs , we shall discuss the problem of the rescaling parameters @xmath77,@xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+ from above comparision of the calculating results obtained by our model with the experimental data we can see that our model has certain rationality , and specific values of @xmath38 and @xmath43 listed in the table 1 are supported by the relevant experiments .",
    "+ firstly , in our model , @xmath77 .",
    "this is the same as the o@xmath0rm .",
    "the latter model can well explain the nuclear effect of the dis process in the region @xmath80 , where the momentum distribution of nucleus is mainly determined by valence quark , so the value of @xmath40 in our model should roughly be consistent with the latter . in physics , @xmath81 can be explained by the swelling of nucleon . when the nucleon is swollen , according to uncertainty principle , the momentum distribution of valence quarks moves to small x region , i.e. the momentum distribution of valence quarks was softened .",
    "+ secondly , because of the following reasons , we assume that @xmath82 .",
    "the first reason is that the o@xmath0rm can not explain the experimental data of nuclear effect of the l - a dis process and nuclear drell - yan process in small x region , where the nuclear effect is mainly determined by the change of sea quark distribution , so we need to reconsider the @xmath0-rescaling parameter of sea quark .",
    "the second reason is that some authors of this paper calculated the values of the nuclear effect function @xmath83 of sea quark distribution by using the experimental data of l - a dis process and nuclear drell - yan process@xmath84}$ ] and found that in region @xmath85 @xmath86 increases from the value smaller than unity to the value slightly larger than unity with x increasing , and the larger the number a , the smaller the value of @xmath87 .",
    "if we use @xmath0-rescaling model to describe this change of sea quark distribution influenced by nuclear environment , it must demands @xmath78 , and the larger the a , the smaller the @xmath42 .",
    "+ thirdly , we shall present another experimental surport on @xmath88 .",
    "it is well known that the gluon distribution of nucleon is the most important in the small x region , and in the region of @xmath89 , gluon distribution almost saturates the parton distributions of nucleon . in the case",
    ", structure function @xmath90 is fully determined by the gluon distribution , and it can be obtained from pqcd@xmath91}$ ] @xmath92}{\\partial(\\ln",

    "if we use @xmath0-rescaling approach to get @xmath105 from @xmath106 and assume @xmath107 where @xmath108 should be smaller than unity , that is to say , the gluon distribution function of a heavier nucleus may be obtained from one of a slighter nucleus by @xmath0 rescaling approach and using @xmath0 rescaling parameter smaller than unity .",
    "therefore , we may conjecture that the gluon distribution functions of all nuclei may be obtained from one of free nucleon or deuterium by this approach and using @xmath109 smaller than unity , moreover , the values of @xmath109 slowly decreases with atomic number a increasing . + in summary , we presented d@xmath0rm , in which different rescaling parameters @xmath110,@xmath111 and @xmath112 are assumed , and the shadowing factor is not introduced . by this model , the experimental data of the l - a dis process , the nuclear drell - yan process and @xmath48 j/@xmath49 production process were consistently and quite satisfactorily explained .",
    "but , this model is a initial and phenomenological model , on the one hand , it needs to be further improved as more precise experimental data presented , on the other hand , its physical foundation still needs to be explored more elaboratively .",
