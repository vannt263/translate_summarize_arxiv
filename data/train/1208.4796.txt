    "ultra - relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei are believed to produce nuclear matter at extreme pressure and energy density .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that a deconfined state of partonic matter which is referred as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , will be produced in such circumstances .",
    "one of the most striking signatures of qgp formation is the suppression of heavy quarkonia states such as the charmonia ( @xmath3 etc ) in the deconfined phase . till mid-2000",
    ", debye screening was thought to be the only possible mechanism for the anomalous quarkonia suppression in qgp but recent work by laine and collaborators have shown that the effective potential between heavy quarks acquires an imaginary part as well  @xcite .",
    "this imaginary part generates the collisional dissociation of bound states by the qgp  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we emphasize the debye screening as the dominant mechanism for the quarkonia suppression in the qgp medium .",
    "charmonia suppressions in heavy - ion collisions have experimentally been studied , first at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) by na50  @xcite and na60 experiment  @xcite at @xmath4 gev and then at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by the phenix experiment at @xmath5 and @xmath6 gev  @xcite , and now at large hadron collider ( lhc ) by the cms and alice experiments at @xmath7 tev  @xcite . however ,",
    "experimental results involve more puzzling features which defy explanations on the basis of colour - screening in the qgp alone .",
    "for example , we notice significantly less suppression at the mid - rapidity than at forward rapidity ( @xmath8 ) while the medium in the central part of the collision is the most dense and intutively one should expect an opposite behaviour .",
    "another interesting experimental observation is similar @xmath0 suppression at sps and rhic energies for the same number of participants  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical efforts have since been made which explore the effects of cold nulear matter ( cnm ) as well as possible coalescence of originally uncorrelated @xmath9 , @xmath10 quark pairs .",
    "however , a complete theoretical interpretation for @xmath0 suppression is still lacking .",
    "many theoretical papers have analyzed the heavy - ion experimental data regarding nuclear modification factor for heavy quarkonia .",
    "for example , @xmath11 data at sps are explained by variety of models  @xcite with or without deconfinement phase transition scenario .",
    "recently yunpeng et al .",
    ",  @xcite analyzed the @xmath0 suppression data using a transport model calculation involving suppression as well as the regeneration of @xmath0 due to coalescence of @xmath9 and @xmath10 pair produced abundantly in the initial stage of collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "zhen qu et al .",
    ",  @xcite used a similar approach to explain the forward rapidity data for @xmath0 at rhic energy .",
    "sharma and vitev  @xcite calculated the yields of quarkonia at rhic and lhc as a function of transverse momentum based on heavy quark effective theory in which both colour singlet and colour octet contribituions along with feed down effects from excited states were suitably incorporated .",
    "their model provides good description of the lhc data for central as well as peripheral collisions . but none of the available models could provide a satisfactory and consistent explanation for the suppression at all energies simultaneously .",
    "we have recently modified  @xcite the colour - screening model of chu and matsui  @xcite by parametrizing pressure instead of energy density since pressure density becomes almost zero at the deconfinment phase transition point .",
    "we have further shown that the variation of survival probability of @xmath0 with respect to participant number obtained from this model compares well with the experimental data ( cnm normalized ) at rhic  @xcite . in the present paper , we reinvestigate the colour - screening model by employing a more realistic thermodynamically - consistent quasi - particle prescription for the equation of state ( eos ) of qgp medium .",
    "this highlights a major difference between our present approach and the model of chu , matsui  @xcite or mishra et al  @xcite because bag model is often considered as a crude eos for qgp .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that various thermodynamical as well as transport quantities obtained from the present quasiparticle model ( qpm ) compare well with the most recent available lattice results  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we incorporate here viscous hydrodynamics in our formulation with a constraint that the ratio @xmath12 varies very slowly  @xcite with the temperature in the qgp medium .",
    "this assumption helps us in taking @xmath13 to be almost independent of the temperature . feed down from higher resonances",
    "have also been incorporated in the model .",
    "we use our formulation to explain the recent lhc experimental data on @xmath0 suppression along with the rhic and sps data .",
    "we surprisingly find that @xmath0 suppression at mid - rapidity is explained consistentely by our model at sps , rhic and lhc energies in qgp picture alone .",
    "furthermore , we compare results obtained from quasiparticle model ( qpm ) with those from the bag model eos on @xmath0 suppression and find that qpm eos describes the data better and thus lends credibility to the present approach in explaining the @xmath0 suppression .",
    "the main theme of the present formulation is essentially borrowed from our previous model  @xcite where we have used the colour screening idea of chu and matsui  @xcite .",
    "however , instead of using bag model for qgp , we now use quasiparticle model ( qpm ) as new eos of qgp .",
    "we have assumed that the qgp medium formed during the collision , expands and cools according to the bjorken s boost invariant longitudinal hydrodynamics in mid - rapidity region . employing the conservation of energy - momentum tensor , the rate of the decrease of energy density @xmath14  @xcite is given by @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the shear viscosity of the qgp medium , @xmath16 is the pressure and @xmath17 represents the proper time .",
    "the energy density and pressure are computed by using qpm eos  @xcite for qgp . using eq.(1 ) and",
    "the thermodynamical identity @xmath18 , the cooling laws for energy density and pressure in the qpm model can be separately given as ( see appendix a for derivation ) : @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants which can be determined by imposing the initial boundary conditions on energy density and pressure , @xmath24 with @xmath25 as the speed of sound in the medium .",
    "we take @xmath26 at @xmath27 ( initial thermalization time ) and also @xmath28 at @xmath29 ; where @xmath30 is the proper time . consequently , the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are related as : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the reynold s number for qgp .",
    "further : @xmath35 using the other initial condition for @xmath36 at @xmath27 , gives the value of @xmath23 as follows :    @xmath37      assuming that the pressure almost vanishes at the transition temperature @xmath38 , we take a pressure profile function in the transverse plane with a transverse distance @xmath39 as  @xcite : @xmath40 where the coefficient @xmath41 is yet to be determined , @xmath42 denotes the radius of the cylinderical plasma and it is related to the transverse overlap area @xmath43 as determined by glauber model @xmath44  @xcite . the pressure is thus assumed to be maximum at the central axis but it vanishes at the edge @xmath45 where hadronization first begins .",
    "the exponent @xmath46 depends on the energy deposition mechanism and here we have taken @xmath47  @xcite ; @xmath48 is the unit step - function .",
    "the factor @xmath41 is related to the average initial pressure @xmath49 via @xmath50 the average pressure is determined by the centrality dependent initial average energy density @xmath51 which is further given by bjorken s formula  @xcite : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the transverse energy deposited per unit rapidity .",
    "we use the experimental value of @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pseudorapidity and then multiply it by a corresponding jacobian factor  @xcite in order to obtain @xmath56 for a given number of participants ( @xmath57 ) at a particular center - of - mass energy ( @xmath58 ) . at the initial proper time , @xmath59 in qpm eos  @xcite and thus @xmath60 .",
    "since the cooling law for pressure can not be analytically solved for @xmath17 and , therefore , we use a trick to determine the radius of screening region . writing the cooling law of pressure as follows :",
    "@xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants related to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . writing the above equation at the initial time @xmath70 and at screening time @xmath71 we get : @xmath72 and @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the qgp pressure as determined by eos in qpm  @xcite .",
    "solving eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) numerically and equating the screening time @xmath75 to the dilated formation time of quarkonia @xmath76 ( = @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the lorentz factor associated with the transverse motion of the @xmath79 pair ,",
    "@xmath80 gev and @xmath81 is the proper time required for @xmath79 pair in the formation of @xmath0 ) , we can find the radius of the screening region @xmath82 .",
    "the screening region is defined as a region where temperature is more than the dissociation temperature so that the quarkonia formation becomes unlikely inside that region  @xcite .",
    "hence the pair will in all probability escape the screening region and form quarkonia only if @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the position vector at which the charm - quark pair is created .",
    "the above kinematic condition takes a simplified form by assuming that @xmath0 is moving with transverse momentum @xmath85 .",
    "thus the above escape condition can be expressed as a trigonometric condition  @xcite :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the angle between the transverse momentum ( @xmath88 ) and the position vector @xmath84 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 .      assuming the radial probability distribution for the production of @xmath91 pair in hard collisions at transverse distance @xmath39 as @xmath92 here we take @xmath93 in our calculation as used in ref .",
    "then , in the colour screening scenario , the survival probability for the quarkonia can easily be obtained as  @xcite :    @xmath94    where the maximum positive angle @xmath95 allowed by eq .",
    "( 13 ) becomes  @xcite : @xmath96 generally experimentalists measure the quantity namely @xmath85 integrated nuclear modification factor and , therefore , the theoretical @xmath85 integrated survival probability is of paramount importance in comparing with the experimental results .",
    "it is defined as follows :    @xmath97    it has been found that only about @xmath98 of the observed @xmath0 come from hard collisions whereas @xmath99 is from the decay of @xmath1 and remaining @xmath100 from the @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "in some recent lattice calculations  @xcite , after constant mode correction , there is no hint for any suppression of @xmath114 and @xmath2 instantly after the transition temperature @xmath115 as pointed out by different studies  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent calculation based on qcd sum rules shows that @xmath0 quickly dissociates into the continuum and almost disappears completely at temperatures between @xmath116 and @xmath117  @xcite . due to above uncertainty regarding the dissociation temperatures of different quarkonia states , we wish to see the effect of @xmath118 in simultaneous explaining the data of rhic , sps and lhc experiments .",

    "1 presents the variation of @xmath85 integrated survival probability @xmath110 with @xmath57 obtained from our present model for the two sets ( labelled as set i and set ii ) and we have shown comparison with the cnm normalized experimental data  @xcite .",
    "moreover , one should keep in mind that from here onwards , we use the same @xmath88 range in all our calculations as used in the related experimental data .",
    "we observe that our new model with set ii yields a reasonable agreement with the experimental data in comparison to the results obtained by the model with set i. furthermore , we find that the changes in @xmath118 values produce more impact on the peripheral collisions rather than on central collisions .",
    "2 demonstrates the variation of @xmath113 with respect to @xmath57 as obtained from our model with set i and set ii , and compare our results with the experimental data again normalized with cnm effect  @xcite .",
    "we again observe that the model with dissociation temperatures given by set ii compare well with the data in comparison to the model with set i. at rhic energy the difference in the results of two models is significant because when we increase the dissociation temperatures for @xmath114 and @xmath119 , the energy deposited in the collision at rhic energy is still not sufficient to melt all the @xmath114s and @xmath119s even in the most central collisions and thus they still provide a significant contribution to the survived @xmath0s .",
    "3 shows the variation of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath57 obtained in our model with set i and ii at lhc energy . here",
    "we find that there is almost no difference in the survival probability calculated with set i or ii for all collision centralities .",
    "we get lesser suppression in @xmath0 at lhc in comparison to rhic .",
    "however , one should keep in mind the integrated @xmath88 range here . for lhc , we include quarkonia having @xmath88 upto @xmath120 gev .",
    "we also present the recent experimental data of nuclear modification factor ( @xmath121 ) of prompt @xmath0 at mid - rapidity ( @xmath122 ) obtained by cms collaboration  @xcite and normalized by cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) contribution at lhc  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative as well as qualitative agreement of our model results with the cnm normalized experimental data appears quite good .",
    "4 shows the variations of @xmath85 integrated survival probability of @xmath0 at rhic energy ( i.e. @xmath123 ) with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "old model represents the results where a bag model eos for qgp along with ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite is employed to calculate the @xmath85 integrated survival probability with two sets ( i.e. , set i and set ii ) of dissociation temperatures .",
    "blank square and blank triangular symbols represent the results obtained in our present model with quasi - particle model eos for qgp medium together with the tool of viscous hydrodynamics .",

    "we have also plotted the experimental data  @xcite ( as shown by solid circles in fig .",
    "2 ) normalized with cnm effect  @xcite .",
    "we find the present model results employing qpm eos for qgp along with viscous hydrodynamics give a reasonably good agreement with the experimental data . again the present model with set ii describes the data more suitably in comparison to all other calculations .",
    "this show the importance of qpm eos for qgp over bag model .",
    "furthermore , in the bag model equation of state  @xcite we have used an additional arbitrary parameter @xmath124 in the bjorken s formula for initial energy density .",
    "its value @xmath125 was chosen in such a way that the resulting initial energy density becomes equal to what has been predicted by the self - screened parton cascade model  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present model using qpm as eos , the energy density does not require any such parameter .    in fig . 5",
    ", we present our new model results for @xmath111 as well as @xmath113 with @xmath57 and also show a comparison with results obtained in our present model when we put shear viscosity ( @xmath13 ) equal to zero ( i.e. , considering ideal hydrodynamic framework ) .",
    "we find that the results in the two cases ( viscous and ideal ) almost overlap on each other for the case of peripheral collisions .",
    "however , @xmath85 integrated suvival probability as calculated from ideal hydrodynamics yields quite significant difference at larger @xmath57 in comparison to the results obtained from viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "this difference becomes more significant at higher energy i.e. , at lhc in comparison to rhic energy .",
    "thus , our study suggests that inclusion of viscous effect in the hydrodynamic evolution is also essential for a complete description of @xmath0 suppression .",
    "in summary , we have presented here a modified colour - screening model for @xmath0 suppression in qgp medium where quasi - particle model ( qpm ) equation of state for qgp and feed down from higher resonance states ( namely , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) , also dilated formation time for quarkonia and viscous effects of the qgp medium have been properly taken into account .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the qgp is expanding under bjorken s boost invariant longitudinal expansion .",
    "the above model is thus used to analyze the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression data from sps , rhic and lhc experiments .",
    "we notice that the centrality dependent and @xmath85 integrated survival probability as obtained in the current model accounts well the experimental data in a consistent manner at all available energies .",
    "we have also compared our present model with the previous model results  @xcite where bag model eos of qgp has been used .",
    "we notice that present model describes the experimental data better in comparison to earlier model results  @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that our model using colour screening picture describes all the features of @xmath0 suppression data simultaneously at sps , rhic and lhc energies with the same set ( i.e. , set ii ) of dissociation temperatures for different quarkonia states .",
    "further extension of this work is underway to explain the complete rapidity dependence of the data for charmonium and bottomonium resonances in order to draw a firm conclusion regarding the overall level of suppression arising from qgp picture alone .",

    "<S> we present a modified colour screening model for @xmath0 suppression in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) using quasi - particle model ( qpm ) as equation of state ( eos ) . </S>",
    "<S> other theoretical ingredients incorporated in the model are feed - down from higher resonances namely , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , dilated formation time for quarkonia and viscous effects of the qgp medium . </S>",
    "<S> assuming further that the qgp is expanding with bjorken s hydrodynamical expansion , the present model is used to analyze the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression in mid - rapidity region and compare it with the data obtained from sps , rhic and lhc experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the centrality dependence of the data for the survival probability at all energies is well reproduced by our model . </S>",
    "<S> we further compare our model predictions with the results obtained from the bag model eos for qgp which has usually been used earlier in all such calculations . </S>",
