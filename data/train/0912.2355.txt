    "the north celestial cap survey ( hereafter nccs ) is compiled from digital imaging observations of the northern celestial cap region ( @xmath5 ) performed at the wise observatory from february 13 , 2009 with the 1-meter boller and chivens telescope and the large area imager at wise observatory ( laiwo ) digital camera .",
    "the nccs is a photometric and astrometric catalogue in the johnson - cousins r and i bands @xcite and is expected to contain more than 1,500,000 distinct objects .",
    "this paper presents technical details of the project and a brief discussion of the quality of the first results .",
    "the nccs catalogue of point and extended objects supports the tauvex project .",
    "the tauvex space telescope array , constructed by elop ( electro - optic industries ltd . ) , a division of elbit systems , for tel aviv university with funding from the israel space agency ( ministry of science , culture , and sport ) , consists of a bore - sighted assembly of three 20-cm telescopes imaging in the vacuum uv the same @xmath4one - degree field of view from geosynchronous orbit .",
    "satellites in such orbits and , in particular , those used for telecommunications , are normally not used for astronomy since they do not point - and - track celestial objects . to allow",
    "the observation of various objects in the sky tauvex is mounted on the side of the indian space research organization ( isro ) gsat-4 satellite on a mounting deck plate ( mdp ) that can aim the tauvex line of sight ( los ) to different declinations , from @xmath6=+90@xmath7 to @xmath6=-90@xmath7 . as gsat-4 orbits the earth on its geo - synchronous orbit , the tauvex los scans a sky ribbon .",
    "the data transmitted to the ground station are reconstructed into a set of uv images of the sky ribbon scanned by the experiment .",
    "the scanning mode of observation used by tauvex implies that the motion of objects through the tauvex field of view is done at the sidereal rate .",
    "because of this , the exposure times for each source vary with declination @xmath6 as @xmath8 . in order to reach",
    "very deep exposures without requiring numerous re - scans of the same sky ribbon , the tauvex observations will mostly be restricted to the circumpolar regions and , for the first half - year of the mission , the area to be observed will mainly be 90@xmath9 ; the northern sky patch covered by nccs .",
    "tauvex in survey mode uses its three principal filters sf-1 , sf-2 and sf-3 .",
    "these filters span the spectral region from somewhat longer than lyman @xmath10 to 320 nm with three well - defined bands .",
    "three filters define two color indices in the uv that can be combined with optical ( e.g. , v - r or r - i ) and eventually infrared color indices to characterize the nature of detected sources .",
    "the availability of visual and near - infrared photometric digital sky surveys from 1990 s , such as dss , sdss and 2mass , made the process of retrieving astronomical data easy as never before and contributed greatly to the development of modern astronomy .",
    "@xcite presented a very good review of sky surveys and deep fields . yet , very few high - quality photometric data are available for the northern celestial cap region .",
    "the nccs aims to produce a catalogue of positions and r - i color indices to complement the uv colours obtained by tauvex .",
    "the first high - quality digital sky survey , the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , was produced by scanning the plates of photographic surveys ( poss - i , poss - ii , eso / serc ) with specific photometric calibrations .",
    "although the dss and its extension dss - ii are both all - sky surveys and cover the north celestial pole region , they are based on photographic observations and suffer from photographic emulsion shortcomings , such as low sensitivity , limited dynamic range and non - linearity . the limiting magnitude of the survey also differs for different directions , depending on which photographic survey was used to retrieve the data ( b@xmath11 for poss - i , @xmath12 for poss - ii and @xmath13 for eso / serc ) .",
    "another great ccontribution of these photographic surveys ( poss - i , poss - ii , eso / serc ) was to provide high - precision astrometry used in catalogues such as usno - a1.0 , usno - a2.0 , usno - b1.0 , etc .",
    "the usno - a and usno - b catalogues were all - sky high - precision astrometric catalogues including also photometric data .",
    "usno - a included two - color ( b and r ) one - epoch data , while the usno - b catalogue included three - color ( b , r and i ) and two - epoch data . the usno - b1.0 catalogue included photometric data with an accuracy of 0.3 mag and astrometric data with an accuracy of 0.2 arcsec for more than a billion individual objects as faint as v@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the catalogue provided separation with 85% accuracy of stars and non - stellar objects with internal magnitudes @xmath15 .",
    "the usno - b1.0 catalogue was released at the same time that the sdss early data release became available .",
    "@xcite compared the two data sets and found `` _ _ systematic offsets as large as 0.25 arcsec ... taken as evidence for distortions of the usno - b1.0 astrometric calibration _ _ '' . moreover , when transforming the catalogue magnitudes to sdss magnitudes and comparing common objects , systematic photometric errors as high as 0.20 mag and dispersions up to 0.34 mag were found , which can be explained probably by the photographic nature of the catalogue .",
    "another digital sky survey is the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "2mass was performed in the near - infrared ( nir ) : j ( 1.25 @xmath16 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath16 m ) and k@xmath17 ( 2.17 @xmath16 m ) with two robotic telescopes in the usa and chile in 1997 - 2001 .",
    "the nir was chosen to minimize the influence of galactic and extragalactic dust on the photometric data .",
    "2mass is not suitable as a reference survey for the tauvex project by itself , since it is nir only and is not sufficiently deep , with limiting magnitudes j = 15.8 , 15.0 mag , h = 15.1 , 14.3 mag and k@xmath17 = 14.3 , 13.5 mag for point and extended sources respectively @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) covers about 10,000 square degrees of the sky and provides high - precision photometric data in five sloan bands with limiting magnitudes of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 for point objects and an astrometric accuracy of @xmath23 rms per coordinate @xcite .",
    "sdss is not suitable as well for the tauvex project purposes , since it does not cover the north celestial cap , but will be used here for comparison , as a commonly accepted standard .",
    "the nccs is essential for the tauvex project since no available survey completely satisfies the requirements to support tauvex in this sky region .",
    "here we describe the method , the achieved accuracy , and provide a comparison with sdss . in a following paper we will present some preliminary results .",
    "the observations were performed at the wise observatory , israel , from february 13 , 2009 in runs of 3 - 9 nights per month . the 1-meter telescope and the laiwo camera were used .",
    "laiwo is a mosaic ccd camera built at the max planck institute for astronomy , heidelberg .",
    "the telescope and camera parameters are listed in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "l|l & +   + clear aperture & 101.6 cm + focal length ( f/7 ) & 711.2 cm + secondary mirror diameter & 51 cm + field of view & @xmath44.9 square degrees +   + number of ccds & 4 science + 1 guider + nimber of pixels & 4@xmath244096@xmath244096 ( science ) + pixel size & 15 @xmath16 m + field of view & @xmath25 + sampling & @xmath40.@xmath2644 per pixel + peak quantum efficiency & @xmath440% between 600 and 850 nm + read - out noise & @xmath27ron@xmath28 e@xmath29 + & ( quadrant - dependent ) + full - well depth & @xmath480,000 e@xmath29 + gain & 5 e@xmath30 adu@xmath31 +    [ tab : param ]    the technical parameters of laiwo determined during its construction were described by @xcite . for a more detail description of laiwo and its performance see afonso et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . nevertheless , we dedicate the following subsection to describe its characteristics and performance for a better understanding of the potential and adequacy of laiwo for the nccs survey .",
    "the laiwo camera consists of four lockheed ccd486 4096@xmath244096 pixel frontside - illuminated devices , refered to as the science ccds .",
    "the laiwo observation manual and some technical details can be found in @xcite and @xcite . at the f/7 focus of the wise telescope",
    "each pixel subtends 0.43 arcsec and each ccd images a 29.5@xmath2429.5 arcmin@xmath32 field .",
    "the ccds are mounted on a single heat sink cooled by liquid nitrogen ( ln@xmath33 ) to -105@xmath34c and are individually connected to the ln@xmath33 dewar with flexible copper bands .",
    "the chips are not contiguous , but are spaced @xmath426 arcmin apart .",
    "each science ccd is connected to four output channels to reduce the read - out time of the entire mosaic .",
    "figure [ fig : layout ] shows the layout of the laiwo 16 quadrants in north - east orientation .",
    "the resultant image of an exposure is a mosaic fits file @xcite consisting of 16 extensions .",
    "the science ccds exposures are binned 2@xmath242 to match the typical seeing , reducing the number of pixels to 16 mpixel sampled to @xmath35 arcsec per binned pixel .",
    "the read - out time of the entire mosaic in 2@xmath242 binning is only @xmath428 sec .",
    "a guider ccd is located at the center of the science ccds mosaic .",
    "this is a back - illuminated e2v ccd47 - 20 device with 1024@xmath241024 13@xmath16 m pixels , corresponding to 0.38 arcsec pixel@xmath31 , with maximal quantum efficiency of @xmath480% and covering a @xmath36 field of view .",
    "the science and the guider ccds can be exposed separately and/or simultaneously .",
    "the guider ccd usually takes continuous short exposures of a small region including a guiding star .",
    "the image is compared to the previous one and , if the shift of the star photocenter exceeds certain limits , the telescope pointing is corrected via a laiwo - telescope interface .",
    "the guider ccd images are not stored by default at the end of the night .",
    "laiwo has no dead or hot pixels , however all the flat field images taken with the camera have all the pixels in column x=1 and in row y=1 saturated in each quadrant .",
    "row y=2 in each quadrant shows sometimes a few saturated pixels .",
    "[ fig : wcs ] shows the world coordinate system specific to each laiwo quadrant . note that the saturated columns x=1 and rows y=1 in each laiwo quadrant are the edge columns and the edge rows of each ccd ;",
    "this saturation feature is not observed in science images .",
    "for this reason , sources located near the image edges are not extracted .",
    "the entire laiwo ccd array detects 1090@xmath3730 cosmic rays ( cr ) during a 300-sec exposure ( @xmath43.6 cr*sec@xmath31 ) .",
    "most crs produce @xmath4100 - 300 counts above the background , with only @xmath47% of the crs produce more than 1,000 counts above the background .",
    "table [ tab : cr ] shows the average numbers of the crs detected in each ccd from four 300-sec exposures of the same field taken on may 14 and june 13 , 2009 .",

    "we described procedures , data treatment , and expected photometric and astronomic accuracies of a survey of the ncc performed at the wise observatory in the r and i bands with the laiwo ccd mosaic on the wise observatory s one meter telescope .",
    "the survey detects some 4,000 sources per square degree .",
    "the source catalog lists their ( @xmath38 ) coordinates to @xmath39 and their r and i magnitudes accurate to 0.15 mag or better for sources brighter than 20.6 in r or 19.6 in i. essentially @xmath4090% of the objects classified by sdss as point / galactic sources are recognized as such by our survey .",
