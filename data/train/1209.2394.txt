    "due to the recent advances in laser technology , ultrahigh intense laser pulses of short durations are routinely produced in contemporary laboratories .",
    "this has inspired the fast growth of high field physics with a renewed interest in studying quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) processes in powerful laser fields ( for recent reviews , see , for instance , refs .",
    "a series of laser - based qed experiments were performed at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )  @xcite , reporting on nonlinear compton scattering and nonlinear electron - positron pair creation processes ( with the latter being of particular importance in light of this paper ) .",
    "these first experiments have triggered numerous related theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , various proposals for the pair production through the laser - matter  @xcite , laser - laser  @xcite , or laser - photon  @xcite interactions have been reconsidered , setting the grounds for predictions of avalanchelike qed cascades  @xcite .        generally speaking , strong - field qed processes fall into two categories as they can be either _ induced _ or _ modified _ by the laser field . while the laser - induced processes do not occur in the absence of the field , the laser - modified processes do , even though their properties can change dramatically under the influence of the field . by way of illustration , the feynman diagrams for the laser - induced and the laser - modified breit - wheeler processes  @xcite , in which the electron - positron pairs are created when a laser beam collides with nonlaser photons , are presented in fig .  [ bwqed ] .",
    "the double solid lines are the fermion lines representing the volkov states  @xcite for electrons and positrons in the background laser field .",
    "it is anticipated that for not too intense laser pulses , as compared to the sauter - schwinger unit of intensity , the laser - induced process , being the lowest order perturbation process , dominates over the laser - modified processes .",
    "exceptions can occur for parameters such that the internal fermion line in the bottom diagrams of fig .",

    "a similar situation is met , for instance , in the bethe - heitler process represented by the _ trident _ diagram , in which pairs are created by virtual photons  @xcite ( see , also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the current paper",
    ", we study exclusively the laser - induced breit - wheeler process .",
    "originally , the breit - wheeler process consisted in a collision of two energetic photons , which combined their energies to produce the @xmath1 pair  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this process for the case when one of the photon sources is a strong laser beam was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these early studies ,",
    "the laser field was treated as a monochromatic plane wave ( see , also refs .",
    "the process in a weakly nonmonochromatic laser field was investigated in  @xcite by means of the slowly - varying envelope approximation .",
    "the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained for an intense laser pulse that includes several oscillations of the field . the breit - wheeler process induced by a few - cycle pulse but in the perturbative regime",
    "was considered in  @xcite . in both these studies ,",
    "the driving laser pulse was circularly polarized , which considerably simplifies the treatment of the problem .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the linearly polarized strong laser pulse driving the pair creation was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , however with the focus on the mass shift effects .",
    "what is important in the context of the current paper is that in neither of the aforementioned works was the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) effect on the yields of produced particles analyzed .    in this article",
    ", we give a complete description of laser - induced breit - wheeler process by finite ultrastrong laser pulses , which is along the lines formulated for the compton scattering in ref .",
    "our current numerical results are for different pulse durations ( i.e. , for few- and many - cycle laser pulses ) in the nonperturbative regime of laser - matter interaction .",
    "it is expected that in this regime , the yields of produced pairs strongly depend on a polarization of the driving laser field , being dominant for the linear polarization .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the bethe - heitler process  @xcite , and it is also the main focus in this paper . in our numerical illustrations ,",
    "we choose the colliding extra photon to be linearly polarized as well .",

    "second , the relativistic invariance of the breit - wheeler process shows that , irrespectively of the value of the laser field frequency in the laboratory frame , it is forbidden to consider the laser field as a slowly changing function on the electron s compton wavelength scale ; in particular , it is not permitted to approximate the action of the laser field by a constant or by a slowly - varying time - dependent electric fields .",
