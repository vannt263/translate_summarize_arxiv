    "equation is an extension to the fractional diffusion setting of the degenerate convection - diffusion equation @xcite @xmath19 when @xmath5 is strongly degenerate , equation has never been analyzed before as far as we know .",
    "the literature concerning the type of equations mentioned above is immense .",
    "we will only give a partial and incomplete survey of some parts we feel are more relevant for this paper .",
    "for a more complete discussion and many more references , we refer the reader to the nice papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but before we continue , we would like to mention actual and potential applications .",
    "a large variety of phenomena in physics and finance are modeled by linear anomalous diffusion equations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "fractional conservation laws are generalizations of convection - diffusion equations ( with @xmath14 ) , and appear in some physical models for over - driven detonation in gases @xcite and semiconductor growth @xcite , and in areas like dislocation dynamics , hydrodynamics , and molecular biology , cf .",
    "@xcite . similar equations , but with slightly different non local term , also appear in radiation hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "equations like are used to model a vast variety of phenomena , including porous media flow @xcite , reservoir simulation @xcite , sedimentation processes @xcite , and traffic flow @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention @xcite where degenerate elliptic - parabolic equations with fractional time derivatives are considered .    in the non - linear and degenerate setting of , we can not expect to have classical solutions and it is well - known that weak solutions are not unique in general . in the setting of fractional conservation laws this is proved in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "to get uniqueness we impose extra conditions , called entropy conditions . in this paper",
    "we will introduce a kruzkov type entropy formulation for equation .",
    "this type of formulation was introduced by kruzkov in @xcite , and used along with a doubling of variables device , to obtain general uniqueness results for scalar conservation laws .",
    "much later , carrillo in @xcite extended these results to cover second order equations like , see also @xcite for more general results and a presentation and proof which is more like our own .",
    "more recently , alibaud @xcite extended the kruzkov formulation and uniqueness result to the fractional setting .",
    "he obtained general results for fractional conservation laws . in a new work by karlsen and ulusoy @xcite , a unified formulation",
    "is given that essentially includes the results of alibaud and carrillo as special cases .",
    "in @xcite the fractional diffusion is always linear and non - degenerate .",
    "the entropy formulation we use is an extension of the formulation of alibaud , and it allows us to prove a general @xmath20-contraction and uniqueness result for bounded integrable solutions of the initial value problem .",
    "our uniqueness proof relies on some new observations and estimates along with ideas from @xcite . from a technical point of view , our proof for @xmath11 is more related to the conservation law ( or fractional conservation law ) proof than the more technical proof of carrillo for @xmath21 ( equation ) .",
    "e.g.  we do not need a `` weak chain rule '' and hence do not need to assume any extra a priori regularity on the term @xmath22 .    in practice to solve we must resort to numerical computations .",
    "but since the equation is non - linear and degenerate , many numerical methods will fail to converge or converge to false ( non - entropy ) solutions .",
    "the solution is to construct `` good '' numerical methods that insure convergence to entropy solutions . in the conservation law community",
    ", it is well known that monotone , conservative , and consistent methods will do the job for you .",
    "there is a vast literature on such methods , we refer the reader e.g.  to @xcite and references therein . for non - linear fractional equations there",
    "exist very few methods and results so far .",
    "dedner and rhode @xcite introduced a convergent finite volume method for a non - local conservation laws from radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "droniou @xcite was the first to define and prove convergence for approximations of fractional conservations laws .",
    "karlsen and the authors then introduced and proved convergence for discontinuous galerkin methods for fractional conservation laws and fractional convection - diffusion equations in @xcite .",
    "after that , the authors introduced a convergent spectral vanishing viscosity method for fractional conservations laws in @xcite .",
    "kuznetzov type error estimates were also obtained in @xcite . in this paper , we discretize for the first time in its general form . we introduce a new difference quadrature approximation that we prove converges to the entropy solution .",
    "the convergence holds for bounded integrable bv solutions , and hence we also have existence of solutions in this class .",
    "finally , existence of solutions in the wider class of bounded integrable function is obtained through approximation via bounded integrable bv solutions ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : existence ] ) .    in many applications , especially in finance ,",
    "the non - local term is not a fractional laplacian , but rather a lvy type operator @xmath23 : @xmath24(x)=\\int_{|z|>0}\\phi(x+z)-\\phi(x)-z\\cdot \\nabla\\phi(x)1_{|z|<1}\\ { \\mathrm{d}}\\mu(z),\\ ] ] where the lvy measure @xmath25 is a positive radon measure satisfying @xmath26 these operators are the infinitesimal generators of pure jump lvy processes .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the theory and applications of such processes and to @xcite for a very relevant and nice discussion and many more references .",
    "the entropy solution theory related to such operators is very similar to the one for fractional laplacians , and the first well - posedness results were obtained in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the entropy theory for to this lvy setting ( cf .",
    "equation ) .",
    "our formulation is an extension of alibaud s formulation and is different from the one given in @xcite .",
    "we also treat completely general lvy measures , i.e.  our lvy operators are slightly more general than the ones in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the fact that is related to fully non - linear hjb equations , see section [ sec : hjb ] .",
    "we first show an easy extension of results from @xcite : in one space dimension the gradient of a viscosity solution of a fractional hjb equation is an entropy solution of a fractional conservation law .",

    "the final part of the paper is devoted to numerical simulations to give the reader an idea about the qualitative behavior of the solutions of these new equations .",

    "the entropy formulation is introduced and discussed in section [ sec : def ] . in section [ sec : uniq ] , we state and prove @xmath20-contraction and uniqueness for entropy solutions of . the monotone conservative numerical method is then introduced and analyzed in section [ sec : num ] . in section",
