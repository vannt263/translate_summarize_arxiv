    "impurity spins embedded in semiconductors are currently under investigation for quantum computing implementations .",
    "recently , optical techniques have been proposed to control the spin - spin coupling and realize two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "@xcite the optical method suggests the possibility of an ultrafast control of the qubits .",
    "the flexibility in the control that can be obtained by pulse shaping  @xcite and the absence of noisy contacts represent additional advantages . on the experimental side ,",
    "ensemble optical measurements have demonstrated the production of spin entanglement for impurities embedded in a semiconductor host .",
    "@xcite more recently , the measurement of the quantum state of a single impurity spin obtained by coupling it to a single exciton in a quantum dot ( qd ) has been experimentally carried out .",
    "@xcite in this paper we study theoretically the control of impurity spin states when the interaction among them is controlled by optically - generated excitons in a qd .",
    "we analyze the control errors due to the radiative recombination of the exciton that mediates the interaction between the spins .",
    "moreover , we illustrate how the control parameters can be obtained directly from simple analytical expressions .",
    "the method is applied to design the control parameters in the production of maximal spin entanglement .",
    "the physical system consists of two impurity spins placed close or inside a qd in such a way that there is not a direct interaction between them . a schematic picture is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_sys ] . by coding the qubit in more than one spin efficient schemes for fault - tolerant  @xcite and exchange - only  @xcite quantum computation can be naturally applied to this setup .",
    "dots of different size provide the frequency selectivity to address specific spin pairs and realize two - qubit readouts .",
    "the model we use contains few parameters describing the exciton - light and exciton - impurity coupling and can be applied to different physical systems .",
    "for instance , it can be used for excitons localized by monolayer fluctuation in iii - v and ii - vi quantum wells and interacting with a finite number of localized impurities as in ref .  .",
    "iii - v or si / ge self - assembled qds can also be used as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sys ] . for typical semiconductor systems we can restrict the analysis to heavy - hole excitons due to the splitting between heavy - hole and light - hole bands in the dot .",
    "the heavy - hole exciton spans a four dimensional space consisting of two optically - active and two dark states .",
    "we treat the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the excitons semiclassically , and we consider spin states that interact only with the photoexcited electron in the dot .",
    "this is the case for instance of donor impurity spins in typical semiconductors because the electron - hole exchange is much smaller than the electron - electron exchange .",
    "notice that by using circularly polarized light the exciton induces , besides the spin - spin coupling , also a local effective magnetic field on the spins.@xcite this effective magnetic field can be controlled by the laser polarization and disappears for linearly polarized light .",
    "we will consider below the case of circularly polarized light .    ]",
    "the exciton - spin part of the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total spin of the two impurities ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 is the energy of the exciton in the dot .",
    "the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 creates an optically active exciton with electron spin @xmath11 and hole spin @xmath12 , while @xmath13 creates a dark state exciton with electron spin @xmath14 and hole spin @xmath12 .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the exchange interaction between the impurity spins and the photoexcited electron in the dot .",
    "the strength and the sign of @xmath16 depend on the system .",
    "for instance , this coupling is expected to be ferromagnetic for electrons in the dot interacting with localized rare - earth magnetic impuritites , while it is antiferromagnetic for a dot mediating the interaction between shallow donors .",
    "@xcite without loss of generality , we will assume @xmath17 below .",
    "the coupling of the excitons in the qd and the external laser field is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the time - dependent rabi energy associated with the optical pulses , and @xmath20 is the energy of the laser . we consider only anti - clockwise polarization ( @xmath21 ) which generates excitons with electron and hole spin states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "excitons with hole spin @xmath22 are not included in the model since they are not excited by @xmath21 light and the impurity spins can only flip the spin of the photoexcited electron .",

    "the total hilbert space is thus spanned by a total of @xmath27 states .",
    "the arrows in the scheme identify the selection rules for @xmath21 optical transitions .",
    "the transitions have different oscillator strengths , which are calculated using the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "notice that the light does not connect directly states with different spin @xmath1 .",

    "we consider separately the case of infinite and finite @xmath36 , i.e. spontaneous radiative recombination lifetime for the exciton in the dot . in the first case",
    "we determine analitically the control parameters that provide maximal spin entanglement . in the second case ,",

    "this will allow us to analyze errors due both to the radiative recombination and to the finite probability of remaining with an exciton in the dot at the end of a pulse .",
    "the latter is an error similar to a double occupancy error in the case of spins controlled by gate voltages @xcite .",
    "ideally , the qd must be empty at the end of each optical pulse , and this can be achieved by an adiabatic evolution , or by a nonadiabatic evolution plus additional conditions in the pulse area  @xcite .",
    "we first analyze the ideal case of a nonadiabatic evolution at @xmath37 .",
    "we call nonadiabatic the evolution that follows from a laser resonant with at least one transition between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 subspaces in fig .",
    "[ levels ] .",

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the entanglement production between two spin - impurities induced by an exciton in a neighboring quantum dot . in the case of @xmath37 ,",
    "the parameters for the quantum control can be analytically determined from the roots of simple integral equations .",
    "we showed that the finite lifetime @xmath36 of the exciton in the dot can affect the purity of the spin states and introduces errors in the entanglement production .",
