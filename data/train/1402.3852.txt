    "to do this we decompose @xmath10 and @xmath11 into their real and imaginary parts , @xmath12 and solve the resulting coupled system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "complex dynamical systems are interesting in part because the particle trajectories @xmath10 typically lie on multisheeted riemann surfaces .",
    "we explore the qualitative features of the classical particle trajectories in the complex-@xmath7 plane , and in particular , we compare the behavior of trajectories in the vicinity of turning points and in the vicinity of poles of @xmath6 . the principal result in this paper",
    "is that turning points act as attractors ( trajectories are drawn to and pulled around turning points ) , but poles tend to repel trajectories and can even screen the effects of turning points .    while complex classical mechanics is a relatively new field there",
    "have already been many papers published on the properties of complex phase space @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have focused on hamiltonians of the form @xmath13 . for such hamiltonians",
    "the complex trajectories associated with a given energy @xmath14 can not intersect .",
    "this is because the hamiltonian is invariant under classical time reversal @xmath15 . for a given value of @xmath7",
    "there are two possible values of the complex velocity @xmath16 , one corresponding to the trajectory going forward in time and the other corresponding to the trajectory going backward in time .",
    "however , hamiltonians such as @xmath17 can have trajectories that cross themselves . for a given value of @xmath14",
    "there may be @xmath18 trajectories emanating from a point @xmath7 , each one having a different complex value of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath18 is odd , @xmath6 is not time - reversal invariant .",
    "this means that if we allow time to run backward , a trajectory will not retrace itself .",
    "hamiltonians of the form ( [ e3 ] ) are especially interesting because , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the turning points of these hamiltonians deflect nearby trajectories by an angle that depends on @xmath18 ; @xmath1 gives a deflection of @xmath19 , @xmath20 gives a deflection of @xmath21 , @xmath22 gives a deflection of @xmath23 , and so on .",

    "all trajectories represent the complex motion of particles having energy @xmath33 .",
    "there are two turning points at @xmath30 ( blue dots in electronic version ) and two poles at @xmath29 ( red dots ) . because the hamiltonian contains a cubic momentum term , at each point in the complex-@xmath7 plane",
    "there are three possible directions for the classical trajectories , and these directions are separated by @xmath34 .",
    "we have chosen three points at random , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , and have plotted the three trajectories originating from each point .",
    "the trajectory that begins at @xmath27 in the northwest direction encircles both turning points and is deflected by @xmath21 each time .",
    "note that the path does not intersect itself because it crosses branch cuts emanating from the turning points and lies on different sheets of a riemann surface .",
    "the trajectory that begins at @xmath26 in an eastward direction is pushed to the north by the simple pole at @xmath32 ; consequently , the trajectory is only slightly affected by the turning points . ]    in earlier studies of complex classical mechanical systems many interesting features were discovered .",

    "@xcite it was shown that a complex classical particle can effectively _ tunnel _ through a potential barrier on the real axis by following a trajectory in the complex plane that goes around the barrier .",
    "it was also shown that classical mechanics could mimic quantum tunneling if the energy had a small imaginary part .",
    "this idea was further developed in ref .",
    "most recently , turok showed that these complex classical trajectories contribute to the saddle point of the functional integral that represents the tunneling amplitude @xcite .    to illustrate the advantage of complex classical mechanics , we use complex classical trajectories to explain",

    "the quantum - mechanical treatment of this system requires that the boundary conditions on the time - independent schrdinger equation be imposed in stokes wedges in the complex plane . to understand the quantum theory heuristically we examine the classical equations of motion ( [ e1 ] ) for this hamiltonian : @xmath36 for a particle of energy @xmath14 , the classical velocity is @xmath37 .",
