    "in this work we continue our effort @xcite to understand the dynamic properties of charged test particles being exposed to the electromagnetic test fields surrounding compact objects  neutron stars and black holes .",
    "as we bear astrophysical motivation in our mind we choose such fields and such background geometries which combine themselves in reasonable models of real situations occurring in the vicinity of these objects .",
    "survey of the test particle trajectories might be regarded as the one particle approximation to the complex dynamics of the astrophysical plasma .    in this contribution",
    "we investigate the motion of charged test particles around the kerr black hole immersed into the asymptotically uniform magnetic field ( wald s solution @xcite ) .",
    "this field allows motion in the off - equatorial lobes if the parameters of the system are chosen carefully @xcite . by off - equatorial lobes we mean closed equipotential surfaces which enclose the stable off - equatorial circular orbit ( so called halo orbit ) .",
    "they symmetrically intersect poloidal @xmath0 plane as seen in fig .",
    "we investigate motion of the charged particles in these lobes .",
    "we are particularly curious what is the dynamic regime of motion ( chaotic versus regular ) and how does it change if we alter some of the parameters .",
    "besides the standard technique of poincar surfaces of section we employ recurrence analysis @xcite and show that recurrence plots might be regarded as an alternative tool to surfaces of section .",
    "quantitative analysis of recurrences appears to be very useful tool to locate the transitions between these regimes in the terms of selected control parameter .",
    "the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath1 is given as follows @xcite : @xmath2 ^ 2+\\frac{\\sin^2{\\theta}}{\\sigma}\\:[(r^2+a^2)d\\phi - a\\,dt]^2+\\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}\\;dr^2+\\sigma d\\theta^2,\\ ] ] where we set @xmath3 and @xmath4 stands for the mass of the black hole and @xmath5 for its specific angular momentum .    in order to incorporate the large scale magnetic field to our considerations",
    "we employ the wald s test field solution @xcite .",
    "vector potential of this axisymmetric test field may be expressed in the terms of kerr metric coefficients as follows : @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 stands for the specific test charge of the black hole ( unlike the kerr - newman solution it does not enter the metric ) .",
    "the terms containing @xmath9 in above equations may thus be identified with the components of the vector potential of the kerr - newman solution @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behavior of the components justifies the identification of the parameter @xmath10 with the strength of the originally uniform magnetic field into which the kerr black hole has been immersed .",
    "wald @xcite has shown that in the case of parallel orientation of the spin and the magnetic field @xmath11 the black hole selectively accretes positive charges ( negative for the antiparallel orientation ) until it is charged to the value @xmath12 .",
    "although the use of the wald s charge @xmath13 is not obligatory ( since the presence of another charging mechanism could be considered for the astrophysical black holes ) it may be regarded as a preferred value .",
    "besides various `` traditional '' methods of the numerical analysis of dynamical systems ( for instance the visual survey of poincar surfaces of section , evaluation of the lyapunov spectra @xcite etc . )",
    "it appears useful to employ rather novel approach based on the analysis of recurrences of the system to the vicinity of its previous states .",
    "recurrence plots ( rps ) as a tool to visualize recurrences of the trajectory in the phase space were introduced by eckmann et al in 1987 @xcite .",
    "rp method is based on the examination of the binary values that are constructed from the phase space trajectory @xmath14 .",
    "construction of rps is simple and straightforward regardless of the dimension of the phase space which is a major advantage of this approach .",
    "binary values of the recurrence matrix @xmath15 may be formally expressed as follows :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a predefined threshold parameter , @xmath18 represents heaviside step function and @xmath19 specifies the sampling frequency which is applied to the examined time period of the trajectory @xmath14 .",
    "selection of the norm @xmath20 which should be used to detect recurrences in the phase space is not straightforward .",
    "although simple norms like @xmath21 ( euclidean norm ) are usually applied directly in this context , we want to reflect the curvature of the spacetime as much as possible .",
    "thus we measure distances in the zamo s hypersurfaces of simultaneity following standard @xmath22 splitting procedure @xcite .",
    "projection tensor we apply to the phase space constituents @xmath23 , @xmath24 is given as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a spacetime metric ( [ kn ] ) and @xmath27 stands for the coordinate components of zamo s four - velocity @xmath28 which may be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath29 setting @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "consequent order estimates lead to the conclusion that the computation of the recurrence matrix @xmath15 may be carried out using euclidean norm applied to the following set of coordinates @xmath32 , provided that the threshold @xmath17 as the upper limit of the distance at which we shall apply this norm is significantly smaller than the characteristic scale of the spacetime curvature . as a length scale of curvature",
    "we may consider @xmath33 , where @xmath34 represents the kretschmann scalar evaluated by contracting riemann curvature tensor .",
    "we must numerically check whether the assumption @xmath35 holds along a given trajectory .",
    "binary valued matrix @xmath15 represents the rp which we get by assigning a black dot where @xmath36 and leaving a white dot where @xmath37 . both axis represent the time period over which the data set ( phase space vector ) is being examined",
    "rp is thus symmetric and the main diagonal is always occupied by the line of identity ( loi ) .",
    "structures in the rp encode surprisingly large amount of information about the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of deciding whether the particular trajectory is regular or chaotic the determining factor is a presence and amount of diagonal structures in the rp . diagonal lines in the rp reflect the time segments of the phase space trajectory where the system evolves similarly .",
    "it captures the epoch when the trajectory runs almost parallel to its previous segment i.e. runs inside the @xmath17tube around this segment @xcite .",
    "hence integrable systems with regular dynamics result in strongly diagonally oriented rps . on the other hand",
    "when the motion is chaotic the diagonal lines are rather short ( because the trajectory tends to diverge quickly ) and more complicated structures are found in the rp .",
    "the recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) @xcite takes number of statistic measures of the recurrence matrix @xmath15 .",
    "first of all we define the recurrence rate @xmath38 as a density of points in the rp : @xmath39    then we turn our attention to the diagonal segments in the rp whose length basically draws distinction between regularity and chaos .",
    "histogram @xmath40 recording the number of diagonal lines of the length @xmath41 is formally given as follows : @xmath42 histogram @xmath40 is used to define the determinism @xmath43 as a fraction of the recurrence points which form diagonal lines of length at least @xmath44 to all recurrence points : @xmath45 average length of the diagonal line @xmath46 ( where only lines of length at least @xmath44 count ) : @xmath47 and divergence @xmath48 as an inverse of the length of the longest diagonal line @xmath49 : @xmath50 since @xmath48 is in its very nature closely related to the divergent features of the phase space trajectory it was originally @xcite claimed to be directly related to the largest positive lyapunov characteristic exponent @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless theoretical considerations justify the use of @xmath48 as an estimator only for the lower limit of the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents @xcite . on the other hand strong correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath51",
    "still arises in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "it appears useful to perform the analogous statistics also for the vertical ( horizontal respectively , since the rp is symmetric with respect to loi ) segments in rps which are generally connected with periods in which the system is slowly evolving ( laminar states ) . to this end histogram @xmath52 recording the number of vertical lines of length @xmath53 is constructed as follows : @xmath54    in analogy with the diagonal statistics histogram @xmath52 is used to define vertical rqa measures .",
    "laminarity @xmath55 is defined as a fraction of recurrence points which form vertical lines of length at least @xmath56 to all recurrence points : @xmath57 trapping time @xmath58 is an average length of the vertical line ( where only lines of the length at least @xmath56 count ) : @xmath59 and finally also the length of the longest vertical line @xmath60 might be considered as an analogue of the diagonal @xmath49 .",
    "generalized hamiltonian (  super hamiltonian  ) which characterizes the dynamics of the test particle of charge @xmath61 and mass @xmath62 is given as follows @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath24 is the generalized ( canonical ) momentum and @xmath64 denotes the vector potential related to the electromagnetic field tensor as @xmath65 .",
