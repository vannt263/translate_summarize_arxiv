    "since the observation of @xmath18 in 2003 @xcite , more and more charmed - strange mesons have been reported experimentally , which include @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , and @xmath22 @xcite ( see ref .",

    "until now , there are good candidates of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states in the charmed - strange meson family @xcite .",
    "these newly observed charmed - strange mesons provide a good platform to study the properties of the higher radial and orbital excitations of the charmed - strange meson .",

    "@xcite sun and liu suggested that @xmath22 can be a good candidate of the @xmath26 state in the charmed - strange meson family , which is the radial excitation of @xmath19 .",
    "the recently reported @xmath11 and @xmath12 states stimulated extensive discussions of whether they can be categorized into the @xmath27 charmed - strange mesons @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body strong decays of @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states in charmed - strange meson family were studied by the quark pair creation model , which shows that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states , respectively .",
    "later , wang studied @xmath11 and @xmath12 using the effective lagrangian approach @xcite .",

    "[ sec : leading ] , we introduce the interpolating currents for the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 heavy meson doublets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and use them to perform qcd sum rule analyses at the leading order . then in sec .",

    "the results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the interpolating currents for the heavy mesons with arbitrary spin and parity have been studied and given in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly discuss how we obtain the interpolating currents coupling to the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 heavy meson doublets @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we use @xmath35 to denote these fields where the first two subscripts denote the spin and parity of the heavy mesons , and the last subscript denotes the angular momentum of the light components .",
    "we also use the following notations : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 is the gauge - covariant derivative , @xmath39 is the heavy quark field in hqet , @xmath40 is the velocity of the heavy quark , and @xmath41 is the transverse metric tensor .    based on the pseudoscalar current @xmath42 of @xmath43 and the vector current @xmath44 of @xmath45 , we can construct the @xmath0-wave interpolating currents , by adding two extra derivatives .",
    "assuming these two derivatives are both acting on the light quark , it can have either @xmath46 : @xmath47 or @xmath48 : @xmath49 use the light quark of @xmath46 , we can construct the interpolating currents coupling to the @xmath0-wave @xmath2 spin doublet .",

    "therefore , we need to do an extra process to project out their @xmath5 and @xmath13 components : @xmath52 where we have modified their expressions to be consistent with refs .  @xcite .",

    ", we can also construct the @xmath0-wave interpolating currents , by adding only one derivative .",
    "for example , the light quark containing one derivative can have @xmath60 : @xmath61 then it can be used to construct the interpolating currents coupling to the @xmath0-wave @xmath2 spin doublet : @xmath62 these two currents can be further manipulated to obtain the pure @xmath5 and @xmath13 currents .",
    "@xmath63 however , compared with these currents containing one derivative , the currents containing two derivatives seem to describe the internal structure of the @xmath0-wave heavy mesons in a more appropriate way , so we shall use eqs .",
