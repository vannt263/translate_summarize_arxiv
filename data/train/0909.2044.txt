    "observations suggest that brown dwarfs ( bds , 0.013 @xmath2 m @xmath3 ) are very abundant in both the field and star clusters in our galaxy @xcite . the origin of brown dwarfs , however , is still under debate .",
    "it has been suggested by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the final stellar mass may be closely related to the jeans mass of the parent gas within the molecular cloud .",
    "given that the typical jeans mass in a typical molecular cloud is of order one solar mass , this is reasonable for larger , hydrogen - burning stars .",
    "however , because bd masses are at least an order of magnitude smaller , it is difficult for bds to form by direct collapse to pre - bd cores .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to circumvent this problem .",
    "one approach is to assume that the initial jeans mass of the core is still a good estimate of the final mass from a direct collapse , but that denser or colder regions exist where the jeans mass may approach the bd mass .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed that local density of in cores can be enhanced by turbulent flows ( `` turbulent fragmentation '' ) , while @xcite suggested that certain types of molecular cooling can greatly decrease core temperatures . in either case ,",
    "formation of bds follows the conventional star formation path .",
    "hence , all properties associated with proto - stars , such as accretion disks and outflows , are expected .",
    "an alternative picture , first proposed by @xcite , suggests that the because the jeans mass continuously decreases during the collapse , fragmentation can keep occurring repeatedly to produce smaller and denser objects until they are too dense to have efficient radiative cooling .",
    "the mass at this `` opacity limit '' is expected to be around @xmath4 .",
    "thus the opacity limit mass , rather than the initial core jeans mass , would set the mass of the smallest fragments . in this scenario",
    ", it normally assumed that these small masses form first .",
    "these so - called embryos then accrete mass and ultimately form both sub - stellar and stellar objects in a scenario referred to as `` competitive accretion '' .",
    "the accretion of the surrounding material onto embryos is assumed to be rapid so that embryos remaining in dense parts of the molecular cloud would ultimately become stellar - mass objects .",
    "@xcite explored this scenario with a simulation of cluster formation from a 50 @xmath5 molecular cloud and found embryos could remain in the cloud undergoing rapid accretion or get ejected during violent interactions , resulting in a large number of low mass objects .",
    "more recent work indicates that a more realistic treatment of radiative energy losses can strongly suppress the formation of sub - stellar objects in such simulations @xcite .",
    "the existence of extended disks around young stellar objects is supported by both observations and theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the disks are initially large and flared at the class 0-i stage ( extending to several thousands au ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are observable at mm or sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "they evolve into smaller , thin proto - planetary disks at the class iii stage that are detectable with infrared observations .",
    "disk lifetimes are inferred to be about 10 myr .",
    "disks provide a natural environment for forming sub - stellar objects because the jeans mass in disks is much smaller than in cores .",
    "it may be possible to form brown dwarf mass companions through the fragmentation of marginally stable ( @xmath6 ) , extended disks around single stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whether disks become cold and heavy enough to spontaneously fragment depends on the disk mass build up from the envelope and the processes that are driving accretion",
    "self - regulated , stable ( @xmath7 ) , extended disks are the outcome for a significant portion of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "the approach that will be investigated in this paper is encounter - triggered fragmentation of otherwise stable proto - stellar disks .",
    "numerical studies by @xcite and @xcite have independently found that instabilities leading to bound companions can be triggered during encounters between stable proto - stellar disks .",
    "fragmentation was seen to occur within the disk @xcite , or in filamentary structures induced by the tidal force between the encountering disks @xcite .",
    "the resultant objects reported by both groups include sub - stellar mass objects .",
    "since most stars form in clusters with a relatively small spread in ages @xcite , it is reasonably likely that a proto - star will undergo an encounter during the time that the disks are large ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following the argument by @xcite , for a plummer star cluster model with mass of @xmath8 and a half - mass radius , @xmath9 pc , the encounter probability in @xmath10 years ( the approximate lifetime for an early extended disk ) with an impact parameter at pericenter of 500 au is about 30 percent .",
    "if several sub - stellar objects form during each encounter , as in @xcite , a substantial numbers of bds can be produced . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the outcomes of specific encounters rather than estimates of their likelihood .",
    "the prior simulation work failed to address several important issues .",
    "firstly , the resolution used in the work cited above did not ensure that the jeans mass was resolved in the original disks .",
    "thus it was not clear whether the objects might have condensed due to numerical effects @xcite .",
    "secondly , the range of circumstances in which gravitational instabilities can be triggered in a stable disk by an encounter were not explored .",
    "the toomre criterion for instability requires that that @xmath11 for thin disks to be unstable to axisymmetric perturbations , where q is the toomre parameter , locally defined according to @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sound speed , @xmath14 is the epicyclic frequency ( close to the angular speed @xmath15 for a keplerian disk ) and @xmath16 is the disk surface density .",
    "analytical studies by @xcite and numerical studies of relatively thin proto - planetary disks @xcite have shown that @xmath17 is in the range 1 - 1.5 for various modes of fragmentation .",
    "if proto - stellar disks are stable according to this criterion then they tend to stay so indefinitely in the absence of mechanisms to redistribute material .",
    "a non - negligible ( vertical ) thickness for the disks can be stabilizing , reducing the critical q value for axisymmetric perturbations from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the toomre parameter during dynamical interactions is a good indicator for the onset of instabilities and fragmentation and this has been explored here .",
    "it should also be noted that the initial disk models assumed in prior work did not resolve the disk vertical structure , which can destabilize the disk ( by increasing the effective critical toomre q ) and artificially enhance fragmentation .",
    "these issues motivated our use of detailed , vertically - resolved initial disk models .",
    "lastly , there have been few predictions regarding the properties of the young bds that could be produced during a proto - stellar disk encounter .",
    "most observed young brown dwarfs show signatures of surrounding disks analogous to the disks around proto - stars , and some of these disks have been identified as accretors through spectral line analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of bd accretion disks has been used as an evidence to support the turbulent fragmentation scenario ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) against dynamical formation mechanisms , especially after the aforementioned simulation by @xcite produced an practically no proto - bd disks .",
    "early encounter simulations , such as the ones by @xcite and @xcite , also reported no proto - bd disks .",
    "however , these negative results are quite likely to reflect insufficient resolution or the impact of approximations such as replacing the fragments with a large `` sink '' particles @xcite",
    ". studies with better resolved disks and fragments were thus required to address this question .",
    "the current study investigated encounter - induced bd formation using a series of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this allowed the jeans mass to be resolved until well after fragmentation initially took place and the vertical structure of the initial disks was also well resolved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ methods ] we describe the numerical method , the construction of the initial disk models and a study of resolution requirements . in section  [ paramspace ]",
    "we present the encounter parameter space being explored , including q values , relative orientations of disks and variations in encounter velocity .",
    "section  [ results ] describes several typical simulations and discusses the conditions for encounter - induced fragmentation .",
    "section  [ objects ] presents analysis of the properties of the resultant objects , including shapes , angular momenta and orbital evolution .",
    "section  [ discussion ] summarizes the results and includes discussion of the observational implications and possible directions for future work .",
    "observing the exact mass , density structure and kinematics of proto - stellar objects during the earliest stages is difficult @xcite . using a hydrodynamical calculation of proto - stellar disk formation",
    ", @xcite found that early disks contain a large fraction of the total mass of the system and collapse relatively slowly .",
    "based on these results , we assumed that the proto - stellar disks were quasi - hydrostatic in order to construct a self - consistent disk density structure .",
    "we chose to simulate systems in the solar mass range with a single model for the disk - proto - star system where the disk mass was about 0.6 @xmath5 , with a stellar mass of around 0.5 @xmath5 .",
    "the disk extended to about 1000 au .",
    "this aspect of the set - up is similar to the disks simulated by @xcite .",
    "a power - law surface density profile @xmath20 was chosen with @xmath21 in 100 - 500 au , consistent with observations of early proto - stellar disks @xcite .",
    "the surface density peaked at 100 au with @xmath22 . within 100",
    "au the gas was initially smoothly truncated .",
    "we relaxed our initial disks in isolation for about 10000 years , during which a small amount of material occupied the truncated region . beyond 500 au",
    "the surface density falls rapidly but smoothly , and at 1000 au @xmath23 .",
    "the entire profile after relaxation is similar to the results from core collapse calculations by @xcite .",
    "most of the disk mass ( 0.5 @xmath5 ) is within 500 au .",
    "it was assumed that the central proto - star was the major heating source for the disk , and that the disk re - radiates like a black - body , giving a disk temperature profile of @xmath24 @xcite for the majority of the simulations .",
    "the profile smoothly transitions to an external , ambient temperature of @xmath25 k. this profile is similar to the @xcite results . with the radial surface density and temperature profiles specified ,",
    "the vertical structure was iterated to a self - consistent hydrostatic equilibrium taking into account both the gravity of the central star and the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "accurate treatment of the gas self - gravity was important given the large disk mass relative to the star .",
    "the choice of radial profile gave a nearly constant q value between 100 - 500 au , with a minimum value ( @xmath26 ) ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 depending on the case studied .",
    "the q value rises in the inner 100 au and the disk is very stable there .",
    "test simulations of single disk evolution with different values of @xmath26 were performed , and it was found that for our disk model values of @xmath26 below @xmath27 were required for spontaneous fragmentation via spiral waves .",
    "this critical value was lower than the ones seen in thin disk models ( e.g. , @xmath28 in @xcite ) , consistent with the results from @xcite that significant scale heights tend stabilize the disk . to rule out spontaneous fragmentation as a factor during the dynamical interactions between disks , the @xmath26 values used were at least twice as the @xmath29 for an isolated disk , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "a fixed temperature profile @xmath24 for most of the disk was used in the majority of our simulations , which is often referred to as a locally isothermal equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "heating sources other than the star , such as shocks , were not taken into account .",
    "for the current study , it was found that the isothermal eos was a good approximation for the initial disk and also acceptable even after disk was heated by tidal structures and shocks ( outside the clumps ) because the disks are extended and initially optically thin .",
    "given the temperature of the gas , using the surface density profile described above and adopting the opacities from @xcite , the product of the disk cooling time @xmath31 and angular rotation rate @xmath15 was calculated and @xmath32 beyond 50 au for the initial disk , which is comfortably within the cooling requirement for the disk to fragment @xmath33 @xcite before the disk is dense enough for the isothermal assumption breaks down .",
    "however , after the disk fragments and the resultant objects became gravitationally bound , the final densities of these objects were typically orders of magnitude larger than the initial values and the objects were thus optically thick .",
    "thus our locally isothermal approximation was initially good but later became an upper bound on how efficient cooling should be . to further examine the importance of cooling in fragmentation , a case",
    "was also investigated with explicit cooling that became negligible in the optically thick regime .",
    "this second assumption is a lower bound for the cooling in a real disk as it disallows even the slow leakage of radiation from dense gas .",
    "the results of this case are described in section  [ cooling ] .",
    "we used the treesph code gasoline @xcite to model the disks during encounters . around 200,000 particles",
    "were used for each @xmath34 disk , with each particle representing @xmath35 1 earth mass .",
    "this resolution was chosen to satisfy the condition that the local jeans mass should be resolved by at least @xmath36 @xcite to prevent numerical fragmentation , where @xmath37 is the number of neighbor particles in sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) simulation .",
    "the number of particles ensured that the jeans mass was not - only well resolved in the initial condition , but also well - resolved when density was enhanced during an encounter ( when the jeans mass decreased ) , up to a density @xmath38 g @xmath39 ( about @xmath40 times the initial maximum value in the disk ) . resolving the jeans mass within the fragments ,",
    "however , was not attempted due to high computing costs ( @xmath41 particles usually required ) .",
    "therefore , our choice of particle numbers ensures physically correct modeling of the initial fragmentation in the proto - stellar disk , but can not ensure that any secondary fragmentation of the clumps themselves are physical .",
    "the initial disk model also resolved the scale height at the mid - plane very well at 100 au ( where the local smoothing length was about 1.9 au and the scale height was about 6 au ) .",
    "within 50 au the scale height of the disk was less well resolved and the orbital time was shortest so that artificial viscous evolution could have been a concern .",
    "the artificial viscosity was moderated using the balsara switch which helps to suppress unwanted shear effects .",
    "the measured viscous time scale in the code was about @xmath42 to @xmath43 years , much longer than the dynamical scale of the encounter , @xmath44 years .",
    "hence , the effect due to the viscous evolution was negligible .",
    "appendix [ resolution ] presents as exploration of the effects of unresolved jeans mass and unresolved disk scale height .",
    "the gravitational softening , @xmath45 , for gas particles was 0.2 au , one tenth of the smallest particle spacing in the initial condition .",
    "thus dense regions up to 1000 times the initial densest part were well resolved .",
    "since a larger @xmath45 usually suppresses gravitation forces , the choice of gravitational softening will tend to inhibit fragmentation once the particle separations are comparable to or smaller than the softening . in all tests ,",
    "including those done for this work and in other work to date , there have been no indications that the gasoline code suffers from artificial fragmentation as a consequence of the gravitational softening being smaller than the local sph smoothing length .",
    "the fixed softenings ensure accurate gravitational dynamics at the cost of having somewhat conservative time steps in lower density regions .",
    "the central proto - star was represented by a single 0.5 solar mass sink particle for which the softening was set to 1 au .",
    "the sink acted within a 1 au radius around the star to consume gas falling into the innermost regions and thus avoid the small time steps required for gas orbiting very close to the star .",
    "however , no objects formed during the simulation were replaced with sink particles , ensuring that any disks surrounding the newly formed , sub - stellar object were modeled directly .",
    "in each pairwise disk encounter , the two disks were identical in size , mass and toomre parameter with an initial impact parameter of 1000 au . due to gravitational focusing during relatively slow encounters the minimum distance between two stars could become substantially less than the initial impact parameter .",
    "the initial disk separation was 6000 au .",
    "this system was initially bound if the relative velocity of the encounter is less than 0.8 km / s and the final impact parameter is a function of the relative velocity .",
    "this study explored six dimensions in the overall parameter space :    1 .",
    "the initial toomre parameter profile characterized using the minimum value , @xmath26 ; 2 .",
    "the geometric configuration of the encounter , including the angles between the two disk planes and the angles between the disk planes and the plane of the orbit of the two disks ( a total of four independent parameters ) ; 3 .",
    "the relative velocity of the encounter .",
    "mass , disk size and impact parameter variations were not included to limit the study to a manageable size .",
    "smaller impact parameters are possible but considerably less likely .",
    "these variations may be explored in future work .",
    "a list of all the simulations is shown in table [ list ] .",
    "the first 3 cases ( q1 , q2 , q3 ) were carried out to study the effect of the toomre parameter on encounter - triggered fragmentation with different initial minimum q values of 1.6 , 1.8 and 2.1 , respectively .",
    "a higher q profile means a more stable initial condition , for which more effort is required to trigger fragmentation .",
    "we selected an encounter configuration where fragmentation was likely ( coplanar , retrograde disks ) to first explore the threshold in initial toomre q@xmath46 , above which dynamical interactions would become insufficient to trigger fragmentation .",
    "this study helped to constrain the region of interest within the parameter space .",
    "previous work by @xcite indicated that fragmentation can take place in tidal structures forming during encounters while @xcite suggested disks would fragment .",
    "the degree of tidal distortion and angular momentum transport has been shown to depend on the initial disk spin orientations ( with respect to the orbital angular momentum ) @xcite .",
    "various disk spin orientations were used in our simulations including prograde cases ( where the angle between the angular momentum vector of the disks and that of the orbit was less than 90 degrees ) , retrograde cases ( where the spin - orbit angle was greater than 90 degrees ) and combinations of the two .    in most simulations",
    "the disks were not close to the same plane , as would be expected for randomly oriented disks .",
    "however , coplanar encounters ( where the spin - orbit angles are zero ) were also simulated as special cases to investigate the shocks generated in such encounters and the possibility of shock fragmentation . in every case",
    "the orbital plane was the x - y plane so that the orbital angular momentum was in the direction of the z - axis .    in a completely generic encounter , as shown in figure  [ diskconfig ] , the disks can be oriented randomly .",
    "the configuration of each disk in the encounter can then be characterized by two angles : the angle between the spin angular momentum of each disk and the positive z direction , @xmath47 , and the angle between the positive x direction and the projection of disk angular momentum onto the x - y plane , @xmath48 , which also determines where that disk intersects the x - y plane .",
    "the initial disk velocities are always along the x - axis and the initial impact parameter is due to an offset in the y - direction .",
    "cases conf1 - 48 explored the ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) parameter space . for a single disk ,",
    "the angle parameters were selected such that the @xmath47 space ( from 0 to 180 degrees ) was divided evenly into three ranges and the @xmath48 space ( from 0 to 360 degrees ) into four for a total of 12 cases .",
    "naively there would have been 144 possible combinations of disks but due to the symmetry of the encounters and the equivalence when the two disks were exchanged in space , there were 42 unique collisions to simulate .",
    "an additional six cases were simulated where at least one disk was exactly in the orbital plane , to investigate the effects of coplanar encounters .    the cases with labels starting with `` vel ''",
    "refer to two series of runs used to examine the constraints due to the initial relative velocity on disk fragmentation for prograde and retrograde encounters .",
    "relative encounter velocities in the range of 0.8 @xmath53 to 6.0 @xmath53 were used in the simulations to investigate the effects of relative velocity on disk fragmentation .",
    "the inferred disk velocities are consistent with the typical velocity dispersion in stellar clusters ( a few @xmath53 , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the exception of a special single case ( `` vel_pro1 '' , see below ) , the number of clumps formed in an encounter generally decreases with increasing velocity .",
    "no clumps formed in prograde disks when the relative encounter velocity was above 4.0 km / s . this result can be qualitatively understood by comparing the interaction timescale with the dynamical timescale of the disks .",
    "though gravitational interactions occur regardless whether or not there is a physical impact , these simulations indicate that significant changes in the density profile occur only when the disks are close enough to physically impact .",
    "the interaction timescale is approximately , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the twice the disk diameter ( 4000 au in this case ) , which gives the rough separation for physical impact .",
    "@xmath56 is the relative velocity of the encounter .",
    "the dynamical timescale within each disk is a function of radius @xmath57 , given by , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the gravitational constant and @xmath60 is the mass of the star .",
    "the encounter timescales @xmath61 were @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 years for relative speeds 0.8 , 2.0 , 4.0 and 6.0 km / s , respectively .",
    "the dynamical timescale @xmath66 was about @xmath67 years at 400 au and @xmath68 year at 200 au .",
    "the implication is that there was insufficient time during fast encounters , where @xmath69 to apply the torque that transfers angular momentum to change the disk profiles and causes fragmentation .",
    "this is more restrictive for prograde disks where tidal structures form further out at distances similar to 400 au .      in the case",
    "`` vel_pro1 '' , star capture occurred and the two encountering stars formed a binary system .",
    "both disks were prograde and large tidal tail structures formed when the disks passed periastron .",
    "the tidal structure dissipated over time and carried away the excess angular momentum from the system , enhancing the formation of a close binary .",
    "the separation of the two components was about 90 au , significantly smaller than the periastron of the trajectory ( about 300 au taking into account the effect of gravitational focusing ) .",
    "the circumbinary disk was about 500 au in radius . at a later time it also fragmented to form a 20 jupiter mass object .",
    "another case where stellar capture occurred is the case `` q3 '' ( as described in section [ toomreq ] ) .",
    "since the starting disk q parameter is 2.1 , the circumbinary disk became hotter and less massive compared to the standard cases .",
    "no fragments formed at the end of the simulation .",
    "the initial disks are retrograde and the encounter did not induce tidal structures .",
    "the two cases above are the only ones where stellar capture occurred .",
    "note that both of them have rather conservative choices of encounter velocities ( 0.8 km / s ) , with which the system are marginally bound at the initial state .",
    "most of the encounters produced clumps with the exception of those with high relative velocities or very stable initial disks ( e.g. @xmath26 @xmath70 2.1 ) .",
    "as described in the last section , bound objects can form from fragmentation of shock layers , instabilities within a disk and in tidal structures . since the timescale of disk encounters ( about 10,000 years ) is short and",
    "encounters may happen when there is still a lot of material obscuring the stars , encounters in progress are unlikely to be observed whereas the sub - stellar objects formed may persist indefinitely .",
    "though these objects may evolve substantially from their time of formation , particularly in terms of luminosity , simulated clump properties such as mass , angular momentum and orbital kinematics can be directly compared with properties of observed objects . in the initial state ,",
    "the disks were well resolved outside 50 au . however , as the simulations progressed , additional matter accumulated in the inner disks improving the resolution elements per scale height . on the other hand , objects with 50 au are likely to experience further evolution such as accretion and migration into the star .",
    "in addition , work by @xcite has suggested that disks this close to a star are optically thick and unlikely to cool fast enough to fragment . for these reasons",
    ", we have excluded objects within 50 au from the sample discussed below .",
    "however , the objects formed within 50 au are not statistically different and properties such as the relative mass distribution would not be significantly altered if these objects were included .",
    "a total of 191 objects formed in our simulations ( excluding the high q cases ) with 144 outside 50 au .",
    "the object masses range from 0.9 jupiter masses ( @xmath71 ) to 127 @xmath71 , extending into the stellar regime .",
    "the mass distribution is plotted in figure [ mass ] .",

    "the simulated population does not include objects much below 10 @xmath71 ) . in this regime",
    "there are 1000 or fewer particles per object .",
    "the numerical gravitational softening ( 0.2 au ) could also inhibit the formation of smaller objects .",
    "thus these simulations are unable to probe whether there is a physical mass cut - off in this range .    .",
    "]    observationally , the sub - stellar imf in open clusters can be well described by a power - law @xmath72 . for young open clusters such as pleiades , @xmath73 orionis and @xmath74 orionis ,",
    "the exponent @xmath75 is close to 0.6 at low masses with an uncertainty of order 0.1 @xcite .",
    "an universal imf was proposed by @xcite in which @xmath76 in the range @xmath77 . in this work ,",
    "we fit the mass distribution of the sub - stellar region ( @xmath78 ) and the best fit gives @xmath79 with @xmath80 uncertainty 0.15 ( figure [ logmass ] ) , consistent with the observed values . above the stellar boundary",
    "the number of objects declines more rapidly with mass and a break is apparent near 0.08 @xmath5 ( or about 0.1 of the central mass ) which is also consistent with the trend reported by @xcite .",
    "there are only 9 objects in total that are beyond 0.08 @xmath5 and thus the statistics are poor . more simulations , including those with varying central star masses , are required to explore the resulting mass function in the low mass , stellar regime .",
    "most of resultant clumps in our simulation are not spherical but have highly flattened , disky shapes ( height to radius ratio @xmath35 0.1 ) , as shown in figure  [ clump ] .",
    "the radii of the disks range from 0.1 au to 10.0 au .",
    "the lower bound is likely to be associated with the resolution limit ( 0.2 au ) .",
    "the disky shape is maintained by the high spin angular momentum of each clump .",
    "depending on the mass and size , the total angular momenta of the clumps range from @xmath81 to @xmath82 g @xmath83/s . assuming the total angular momentum is conserved during the evolution and adopting a typical radius of a brown dwarf to be @xmath84 cm @xcite , the rotation speed at the edge of the brown dwarf would be 10 times the break up speed .",
    "thus the proto - brown dwarfs disks must shed rotation in order to collapse down to a proto - bd .",
    "this result is consistent with recent mid - ir , sub - millimeter , and millimeter observations of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of young brown dwarfs , which indicate that most of them are surrounded by circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a t tauri accretion phase has also been indicated in some young bd disks by the detection of broad , asymmetrical @xmath85 lines @xcite .",
    "the ir excess in seds was found to decrease as the age of bds increases , which suggests that the bd disks evolve from flared to flat geometry similar to proto - stellar disks @xcite .",
    "the clumps in our simulations are flat partly due to the assumed isothermal eos . as explored in section  [ cooling ] , these dense condensations are probably optically thick and would thus be hotter and more puffed up in nature .    . ]",
    "the simulations were terminated a few thousand years after first object formed due to computer time limitations . in some objects ,",
    "like the one shown in figure [ clump ] , by the time the simulation was halted , the gas with lower specific angular momentum had started to condense into the center and a density gradient had also been established . because the gravitational softening ( 0.2 au ) is comparable to the size of most clumps , our ability to resolve the structure and follow the evolution of the proto - bd disks is limited .",
    "however , it can be expected in later evolution a central proto bd will form and the surrounding disk will accrete onto it on a viscous timescale .    in the majority of cases where clumps formed from fragmentation of disks , the spin directions of the proto - bd disks are similar to their parent proto - stellar disks . in the case where the shock layer fragments , however , the resultant proto - bd disk may spin in a direction different from both disks . for the proto - bd disks that are still orbiting the star , further interaction with their parent disk will influence the final spin .",
    "typically where fragmentation occurred more than one object was produced .",
    "about 15 percent of the objects are in bd - bd binary systems .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the observed binary fraction ( around @xmath86 % at the range 0.01 to 0.1 @xmath5 ) ( cf .",
    "figure 3 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases , the binaries formed from secondary fragmentation of very large disky clumps .",
    "further numerical studies with higher resolution are necessary to investigate this question in detail because , although the jeans mass was well resolved before fragmentation and most of the clumps are resolved by at least 1000 particles , the jeans masses of the clump themselves decrease so quickly with increasing density that they are only marginally resolved in our simulations . without resolving the jeans mass , it has been suggested that fragmentation could be artificially enhanced @xcite . however , given the very high spin rate of the clumps , secondary fragmentation is likely to occur , according to @xcite .",
    "most of the bd binary systems were still bound to the central stars when the simulations were terminated .",
    "for example , in case `` conf5 '' , the binary system orbits the star at @xmath35 140 au , with the two components ( mass 19 @xmath71 and 13 @xmath71 ) orbiting each other in a period of around 30 years and with separation about 3 au .",
    "each component has a highly flattened shape . in future evolution",
    ", it is expected that some of these binaries will merge to the star , leave the system , or be ejected in close interactions with other objects .",
    "the surviving systems are likely to remain hierarchical star - bd multiples .",
    "thus the collision mechanism may explain the origin of observed star - bd multiple systems such as gl 569 , where a recently confirmed bd triple ( gl 569b ) orbits the primary , an m2.5v star ( gl 569 a ) @xcite .",
    "the system is about 100 - 125 myrs old so no bd disks were observed .",
    "however , in younger bd multiples accretion signals have been detected @xcite , indicating accretion disks surrounding components of the multiple .",
    "objects in our simulations typically formed at least 50 au away from the closest star .",
    "approximately 60 percent of the objects formed were not bound to the system .",
    "the percentage is higher for coplanar encounters , in which the shock layer fragmentation can take place relatively far out in the gravitational potential of the stars .",
    "the unbound objects may leave the whole system to become free floating bds ( or bd binaries ) or low mass stars .",
    "for the objects that are bound to the star , the orbital properties vary from case to case",
    ". about 5 percent of the orbits have very large semi - major axes ( @xmath70 500 au ) but are still bound to the system . since the outer proto - stellar disk was dispersing in most encounters , sub - stellar objects in large orbits were unlikely to accrete additional gas to become low mass stars .",
    "hence these objects may remain as wide - separation bd companions , which have been detected in observations @xcite . where more than one object orbits the star on nearby orbits dynamical interactions can take place resulting in the preferential ejection of lower mass objects @xcite .",
    "the 11 objects that were ejected to significant distances during the simulations were lower in mass .",
    "however , the majority of the objects were unbound and would ultimately become free - floating .    for the clumps that stay in the dense region of the proto - stellar disks ( within 100 au ) , the future growth and evolution depend on the rate that the gas accretes onto the objects . under the assumption of efficient gas accretion , as in the competitive accretion scenario @xcite , these objects may eventually become low - mass stars over timescales much longer than those simulated here .",
    "the simulated disks produced dense regions as they evolved and reached the point where they were no longer uniformly optically thin . the disk material itself tended to remain optically thin ( @xmath87 ) and was thus capable of efficient cooling but the fragments within the disk reached high densities where the radiative cooling times became very long .",
    "thus on the timescale of these simulations , the interiors of the fragments were effectively adiabatic .    in earlier work on proto - planetary disk fragmentation @xcite ,",
    "the approximation of converting the entire simulation to adiabatic gas was employed to test the behaviour in this regime .",
    "this corresponds to the extreme where cooling is completely absent . a less extreme test with strong suppressed cooling is to smoothly interpolate from efficient black - body cooling when the gas is optically thin to no cooling in the optically thick regime .",
    "optically thin black - body radiative losses are given by , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the luminosity , @xmath14 is the opacity , @xmath90 is the temperature and @xmath91 is the total mass . the opacity was taken to be 1 @xmath92 g@xmath93 at @xmath94 with a power - law variation with temperature as @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with the dust opacity values calculated by dalessio et al .",
    ", as tabulated in @xcite , over the range of 10 - 300 k.    we then took a late stage of a representative run `` conf30 '' at 15000 years , after fragmentation had occurred , and measured the optical depth to infinity in 12 directions ( corresponding the faces of a dodecahedron ) for each particle .",
    "this allowed us to estimate the averaged effective optical depth , @xmath96 .",
    "we found that the effective optical depth correlates fairly well with gas density in the regime , @xmath97 to @xmath98 g @xmath39 , where the material transitions from optically thin to ( @xmath99 ) to optically thick ( @xmath100 ) as @xmath101 .",
    "the _ rms _ deviation of the fit is @xmath102 dec in @xmath103 .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , we can then estimate the fraction of the emitted light ( given by equation  [ optthinemit ] ) that escapes the disk entirely .",
    "we then assume that the rest of the emission is absorbed on - the - spot , an approximation commonly used for optically thick lines in models of emission nebulae , so that the net radiative loss , @xmath104 , from one particle is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the particle mass , temperature and density , respectively . in the limit of infinitesimal particle masses ,",
    "this expression is proportional to the contribution to the surface flux from a mass of gas , @xmath109 . in the case of an infinite plane - parallel slab ,",
    "when an analytic expression for @xmath110 is used and the flux contribution is integrated from the surface to high optical depth the total surface flux asymptotically approaches the value of @xmath111 .",
    "the assumption for the main set of simulations was that the disk temperatures were set by heating from the central star offset by radiative losses so that the net temperatures were a function of the distance to the nearest star . to include the effect of heating by the star , the governing equation of the particle energy per unit mass , @xmath112 , is , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the temperature determined from an equilibrium between stellar heating and radiative losses at the radius @xmath115 from the nearest star",
    ", @xmath116 is the compressive heating term and @xmath117 is the shock heating term .",
    "thus the model now includes compressive heating and shock heating . outside the intense collision environment , where these process are unimportant in relation to stellar heating",
    ", the disk temperatures relax to the temperature as a function of radius assumed in the preceding sections .",
    "overall , this similar to the approximation employed by @xcite , where local cooling was based on the amount of radiation escaping from regions with similar physical conditions in spherical collapse models . in the approximation used here the radiative loss rates",
    "were calibrated from similar disk cases .",
    "our approximation retains thermal energy indefinitely in the denser gas and is thus conservative with regard to ensuring that the fragmentation is not a result of favourable cooling assumptions .",
    "detailed radiative transfer calculations should give results between this approximation and the isothermal eos .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that the optically thick parts of proto - stellar disks are likely to be convective , in which case our neglect of radiation as a heat transport mechanism may not have a large impact on the disk structure .",
    "however , the cooling of the optically thin surface layers are approximately correct in this model .",
    "full radiative transfer has been implemented within the gasoline code ( rogers , shen & wadsley , _ in preparation _ ) and will be applied to proto - stellar disk collisions as part of future work .",
    "we re - ran the simulation we used to calibrate the effective optical depth - density relationship using the new cooling approximation .",
    "figure [ optical_thick ] compares the disks at 14,000 years in the locally isothermal run ( panels that are labeled with `` iso_1 '' and `` iso_2 '' ) with the ones in the new run ( panels labeled with `` thick_1 '' and `` thick_2 '' ) . using the isothermal equation of state , one of the disks fragmented and formed ten bound objects , including two binary systems .",
    "however , when using the optical thick approximation , the cooling is suppressed and the disk does not fragment immediately . instead , it is the tidal structure induced by the gravitational resonance that condensed and formed a clump at about 410 au from the star . at later time steps ,",
    "the gas in the tidal tail dissipated and the objects orbit the star at about 350 au . the clump had a mass of 0.075 @xmath5 , close to the hydrogen burning limit .    .",
    "]    compared to the objects that formed in the corresponding isothermal run , the clump had a more spherical shape . nevertheless , the angular momentum of the object was still very high , about @xmath118 g @xmath83/s . by the end of the simulation we did not see flattening as the clump could not cool with this approximation .",
    "if no angular momentum was lost the final object would spin at 30 times the break up speed .",
    "hence we expect the clump to collapse to a disk similar to the ones formed in the isothermal run and that jets and fragmentation could occur in nature as before .",
    "thus with heavy cooling suppression , beyond that expected in nature , we retain our main result , i.e. there was still gas condensation and the formation of clumps due to encounters . the number and the shape of the clumps at the end of simulation",
    "was strongly affected .",
    "exploring the effect of differing thermal regulation on encounter - induced fragmentation will be a target for future work .",
    "in this work , the possibility of encounter - induced disk fragmentation as a mechanism for forming sub - stellar objects was investigated . the significant increase in resolution over previous work and",
    "the use of a realistic initial disk model ensures that the initial fragmentation to form clumps was physically modeled within the constraints of our thermal regulation assumptions .",
    "these simulations have shown that encounters can trigger the formation of brown dwarfs as well as low mass stars .",
    "we found that strong instabilities can be triggered in stable disks with initial @xmath119 , by lowering the local q value with large gas inflows during an encounter .",
    "a relatively steep surface density profile ( @xmath120 ) and a relative high ambient temperature ( 40 k ) were used in our simulations .",
    "if disks have shallower density profiles , as was found in some observations of early disks @xcite , and hence have large portions of their mass in the cooler , outer region , the rate of fragmentation could be even higher .    by studying collisions with random initial orientations",
    ", it was also found that retrograde encounters ( disks with retrograde spins relative to the orbital angular momentum ) more effectively transport angular momentum , triggers gas inflows and ultimately produce more clumps on average than the prograde ones ( figure [ thetatrend ] ) .",
    "these results differs from those reported for simulations of star - disk encounters which indicated that prograde encounters were more efficient in triggering disk instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difference may relate to having an extended perturber .",
    "dense shock layers may occur during coplanar encounters and result in objects as seen in previous work .",
    "however , our results indicate that only slow coplanar encounters ( cases `` conf1 '' and `` conf2 '' ) , where the shock layer had time to accrete substantial mass , can undergo fragmentation .",
    "this differs from the results of @xcite , where a large fraction of their objects formed in the fragmentation of shock layers in both coplanar and non - coplanar cases .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the use of more unstable initial disks , numerical problems related to lower resolution or the absence of vertical structure in the disk models ( appendix [ resolution ] ) .",
    "however it should be noted that coplanar encounters are very rare if the disk orientations are random .",
    "the velocity constraint found in our simulations implies the number of bds produced in encounters is a strong function of the velocity dispersion in the young star cluster .",
    "however , the numerical trend as a function of cluster density can be complicated .",
    "on one hand , more massive and denser clusters usually have larger velocity dispersions and hence likely to produce fewer sub - stellar objects per encounter . on the other hand , high number density will increase the encounter rate which could potentially increase the bd numbers .",
    "the encounter mechanism is complementary to other mechanisms for producing bds .",
    "proto - stellar disks in close proximity are naturally produced when star cluster formation is simulated from cloud collapse .",
    "simulations of massive clouds typically lack the resolution necessary to form large stable disks or to follow subsequent encounters in detail @xcite .",
    "thus this mechanism is compatible with ideas such as competitive accretion and turbulent fragmentation .",
    "the relative importance of these processes for forming proto - stars may influence the typical separation and orientation of proto - stellar disks and thus affect the starting point for encounter driven object formation .",
    "these statistics also depend the larger environment , such as the size , the mass and the amount of turbulent motion in the star forming cloud .    a dynamical encounter origin for some bds might explain observed differences in binary statistics between stars and bds in different cluster environments .",
    "some observations have indicated that the ratio of bds to stars is higher in denser clusters .",
    "for example , @xcite found in trapezium , the number ratio ( @xmath121 ) of sub - stellar objects ( @xmath122 ) over stars ( @xmath123 ) is about 0.20 , while @xcite calculated for taurus aggregates and ic 348 @xmath121 is about 0.14 and 0.12 respectively , significantly lower than trapezium .",
    "the results are not conclusive as other surveys have indicated that @xmath121 in taurus is comparable with that in trapezium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . to make further predictions about how the bd ratio may be related to the cluster properties , more comprehensive simulations and parameter studies would be required , in which the encounter rate in different cluster environment is estimated in detail and the encounter velocity parameter space is well sampled",
    "almost all the clumps formed in the isothermal simulations have flattened shapes . in the future evolution , we expect these clumps to centrally condense to form a proto - bd with a disk .",
    "material should accrete onto the central object on the viscous timescale .",
    "observations indicate that the accretion rate for low mass stars and sub - stellar objects can be approximately fitted by @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "hence for a relatively massive brown dwarf with 0.05 @xmath5 the accretion rate is around @xmath125 . with this rate",
    "the bd disk can have a mass as low as @xmath126 and still have lifetime comparable to proto - stellar disks . to shed angular momentum ,",
    "a proto - bd disk might also launch bipolar outflows or form sub - stellar companions .",
    "since most bds formed during encounter - induced disk fragmentation have large excess angular momenta , we expect outflows or companions to be be common for young bd formed this way .",
    "recent observations have found forbidden emission lines in bd spectra , suggesting outflows @xcite . in particular ,",
    "an outflow from a young bds @xmath127 oph 102 has been spatially resolved @xcite .",
    "some of proto - bd disks in our simulations underwent secondary fragmentation and form binary bd systems ( cf .",
    "section [ binary ] ) . due to resolution and physical limitations",
    ", this result needs to be confirmed with better simulations .",
    "however , the rapid rotation of these disk favours fragmentation @xcite which can form companions of a range of masses .",
    "this provides a mechanism for forming the observed bd - bd binaries with the small separations peaking at @xmath35 1 to 4 au and with almost equal mass components ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "planetary - mass companions have also been observed surrounding young bd ( e.g. 2m1207b * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "possible future work could follow several directions .",
    "firstly , the predictive power would be improved if parameters other than disk configuration were to be well sampled , particularly the velocity of the encounter , the disk properties and the star masses .",
    "combined with a detailed calculation of encounter rates as a function of cluster density and velocity dispersion , quantitative results could be obtained to directly compare with the observations of bd to star ratios , @xmath121 . secondly ,",
    "when the optical - thin approximation fails in high density regions , the effects of shock heating and radiative cooling become more important and should be further investigated . including radiative transfer in the simulation is likely to reduce the number of objects formed per encounter , and provide for more realistic evolution of the proto - bd disks ( as indicated in the optically thick approximation , section [ cooling ] ) .",
    "alternately , with simplified models , the evolution of the clump themselves could be followed over long timescales .",
    "when designing the simulation the resolution requirement was estimated from the @xcite criterion , i.e. , the jeans mass should be resolved by at least twice the number of neighbour particles , @xmath128 . in our simulations",
    "we used exactly 32 neigbours . in the initial condition , the density of our disk varies from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "using our temperature profile , described in section [ methods ] , the jeans mass at the highest density for the initial disk was estimated to be 0.0095 @xmath5 . hence resolving the initial disk of 0.6 @xmath5 , which contains about 63 of these smallest jeans masses requires about 4000 particles for each disk . during the encounter , however , as shown in section [ results ] , large inflows of gas and unstable modes increase the density significantly .",
    "the density typically increases by three orders of magnitude locally where fragmentation will then occur . therefore to resolve the smallest jeans mass during the simulation significantly more particles were necessary . to correctly simulate gas with densities up to @xmath131 about 127000 particles",
    "were needed .",
    "we used 200000 particles for each disk , which met the above requirement and ensured that the fragmentation was physically modeled .",
    "the effects of resolution and the finite scale height were studied with two - dimensional simulations and through analytical arguments by @xcite .",
    "we performed two sets of comparison simulations to investigate these effects in three dimensions .",
    "the first set consisted of three simulations of isolated disks with the same surface density and temperature profile and a minimum toomre q of 1.3 , well above the critical value of 0.8 .",
    "the first disk was modeled by the single layer of 2000 particles .",
    "the second had 20000 particles but still had no vertical structure .",
    "the third one used 200000 particles and the vertical structure was modeled using the methods described in section [ methods ] .",
    "figure [ res_single ] depicts the results for each disk at a later time step .        while no structure formed in the third , well - resolved simulation , strong gravitational instabilities and fragmentation occurred in the first two within several outer orbital periods .",
    "note that in the first case with 2000 particles the jeans mass was not resolved in the high density region of the initial disk .",
    "for the second case although the jeans mass was fully resolved everywhere in the initial condition ( not necessary during the simulation ) , the lack of vertical structure in the model was still destabilizing and artificial fragmentation occurred .",
    "although it is not clear from these two simulations which factor ( resolving jeans mass or modeling the finite thickness ) is more important to prevent unphysical fragmentation , the test simulations show that it is essential to consider both factors in the simulation .",
    "the second series consist of two simulations of retrograde dynamical encounters of disks with q = 2.1 .",
    "the disks were very stable in isolated runs .",
    "the dynamical parameters of the encounter was the same as case `` q3 '' in table [ list ] .",
    "in the first simulation the disks were modeled by single layer of 2000 particles , while in the second the disk was resolved by 200000 particles and had vertical structures .",
    "the results is depicted in figure [ res_encounter ] .",
    "similar to the isolated runs , without properly resolving the jeans mass and scale height , the encounter triggered fragmentation at time step of 19700 years in the shock layer between two coplanar disks ( panel 2 , figure [ res_encounter ] ) . in the second simulation , although the shock layer was still produced ( panel 4 ) , no fragmentation occurred in the layer . the encounter was also modeled using 400000 particles with the same result .    in summary , regardless of whether the disks are passively evolving or undergo a physical impact",
    ", numerical effects may be significant if the jeans mass is not resolved or if no vertical structure is presented in the disk model .",
    "the major numerical effect is then enhanced instability and the formation of artificial clumps .",
    "our resolution of 200000 particles was chosen based on a conservative estimate of resolution requirements , e.g. , it assumed the density of the whole disk could increase up to @xmath131 .",
    "in fact , most outer region of the disk had density below @xmath132 when fragmentation initial occurred . with this resolution it was ensured that the initial disk fragmentation ( if any ) was physical .",
    "we also performed simulations at higher resolution ( 400000 and 800000 particles ) for some specific cases and the results converged ."
