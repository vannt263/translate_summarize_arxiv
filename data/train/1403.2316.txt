    "our analysis is based on a one band mean - field hubbard model with competing @xmath0-antiferromagnetic ( @xmath0-af ) and d - wave superconducting ( dsc ) orders , which we have invoked previously in connection with electron - doped cuprates^8^. using quasi - particle gw ( qpgw)^9^ self - energy corrections , we have shown that this model provides a reasonable description of many salient features of the electronic spectra of the cuprates as observed in arpes^10^ and other spectroscopies^11,12^. the hamiltonian is @xmath9\\sum_{{\\bf k}}[\\delta_{\\bf k}c^{\\dag}_{{\\bf k},\\uparrow } c^{\\dag}_{-{\\bf k},\\downarrow}+\\delta^*_{\\bf k}c_{-{\\bf k},\\downarrow}c_{{\\bf k},\\uparrow}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the fermi energy , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron of momentum @xmath13 and spin @xmath14 , respectively",

    "we take the superconducting dome to terminate at the vhs^16^. this gives a sc dome which starts at @xmath39 , peaks at @xmath37 , and terminates at @xmath38 .",

    "we used the data for the effective @xmath47 calculated in ref.^3^ , fit to a decaying exponential @xmath48 where @xmath45 is the doping @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the first holes create a hole pocket in the lmb near the @xmath5 point in the brillouin zone .",
    "the model has two transitions in the fs topology as a function of doping . the magnetic gap @xmath52 decreases with doping , and goes to zero at some critical value of @xmath45 where the large nonmagnetic fs is restored ( tt2 ) .",
    "before this happens , however , the umb crosses the fermi level , giving rise to an electron pocket near @xmath53 .",
    "this is tt1 in bi2201 in the vicinity of which the fs - free superconductivity arises .",
    "a recent arpes study in underdoped bi2201 determined the spectral weight loss associated with two transitions as a function of doping and temperature^5^. they found that the antinodal spectral weight began to decrease linearly with @xmath54 below a temperature scale @xmath55 , the pseudogap , and then the slope changed to a second value below a scale @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , the superconducting temperature .",
    "@xmath58 signals the onset of superconducting pair fluctuations in the antinodal ( an ) region near @xmath8 , and it is determined at the point on the fs nearest to the antinode . here",
    "we analyze the @xmath59 limits of the weight loss , where the pseudogap weight loss is taken as the linear extrapolation of the weight loss above @xmath58 to @xmath59 , and the antinodal sc weight loss is the difference between this value and the total weight loss at @xmath59 . in our model ,",
    "the pseudogap is assumed to be associated with @xmath0-af order .",
    "the experimental data^5^ display a remarkable evolution of low - temperature spectral weight with doping @xmath45 . while the pseudogap spectral weight decreases with doping ( blue symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) , the an pair weight , green symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , remains small in most of the underdoped ( ud ) regime , increases sharply to a peak slightly above optimal - doping ( opt ) , and then decreases in the overdoped ( od ) regime .",
    "our model predicts a similar doping evolution of the pseudogap and an pair weight , blue and green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , respectively .",
    "the calculated pseudogap spectral weight is estimated as the change in spectral weight between the paramagnetic ( pm ) and af phase ( defined as the af state at @xmath59 with sc order suppressed ) .",
    "the an pair weight is defined as the difference in an spectral weight between the af state and the zero temperature system with af and sc order .",
    "the experimental data are defined by linear extrapolation of @xmath54-dependent trends to @xmath59 , which may lead to some minor differences with our calculations .",
    "the sharp transition of spectral weight in the ud regime is a signature of tt1 : when the an electron pocket is lifted above @xmath10 with decreasing @xmath45 , the af order rapidly increases , but the sc pairing strength drops sharply when the pocket is too far from @xmath10 to contribute to pairing .",
    "this tt occurs at @xmath60 ( due to complications when sc order is present , we define the crossing point in a model with af order only , with sc order artificially set to zero . ) marked as a black vertical dotted line in fig.[fig:1](b ) , corresponding to the sudden increase in pair weight loss . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the electron pocket is @xmath62  mev above @xmath10 , too high in energy to induce any pairing . at the same time , nodal pairing persists to considerably lower doping .",
    "notably , tt1 has been found in bi2201 from thermopower^20^ near @xmath63 [ green dashed line ] , and in stm^15^ [ orange dot - dashed line ] near @xmath64 , while a similar tt has been reported in bi2212 near @xmath65 ^ 21^. an analogous tt1 is also found in electron doped cuprates^3,4^ , where a hole pocket appears , centered around the antinode , near @xmath66 .",
    "while there is good agreement between the aforementioned estimates of tt1 , @xmath67 , the transition seen in arpes^5^ appears to lie at a significantly higher doping , with sharp changes appearing in the overdoped regime .",
    "this may indicate that arpes is observing a different _ tt _ , possibly associated with a competing charge density wave ( cdw ) order not captured by the present model^22,23,24,25,26,27^. note that in the arpes^5^ data an pair weight actually appears at a much lower doping , close to @xmath68 , arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "tt1 is reflected in many properties of the cuprates .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) shows that the self - consistent magnetization drops sharply across the transition as the electron pocket opens .",
    "[ fig:3 ] considers evolution of the sc gap and the density of states ( dos ) in the vicinity of this tt . in the absence of superconductivity ( red dashed curves )",
    ", the bottom of the umb shows up as a step increase in the dos , starting just above @xmath10 at @xmath60 , and moving well below @xmath10 at @xmath69 , with the transition occuring at @xmath60 .",

    "[ fig:3 ] , at @xmath69 the bottom of the umb is well below @xmath10 above @xmath1 .",
    "when sc turns on , the bottom of the umb is shifted to lower energy , and the superconducting gap appears as a single feature .",
    "the sc gap is fairly symmetric , but with excess weight below @xmath10 . at @xmath71 ( middle row ) ,",
    "the situation is completely changed .",
    "the bottom of the umb is no longer seen clearly , but the sc gap now has two components , an inner gap and an outer gap , similar to what was found earlier in bi2212 ^ 21^. note that the gap asymmetry has now reversed , with more weight above @xmath10 .",
    "the interpretation of these features can be clarified with reference to the @xmath72 results in the top row of fig .",
    "the anisotropy is larger , indicating that the outer peak above @xmath71 is derived from the bottom of the umb .",
    "an analysis of the composition of the wave functions further confirms that at @xmath73  0.13 there is a coherence peak in the an region , even though the umb would be entirely above the fermi level in the absence of sc .",
    "this is the essence of the phenomenon of _ fermi - surface - free superconductivity .",
    "_ to understand the origin of the two gap features , we decompose the dos into nodal parts , figs .",
    "[ fig:3](b , e , h ) , and antinodal parts , figs .  [ fig:3](c , f , i ) .",
    "the inner and outer gap can now be seen to arise from the nodal and antinodal regions , respectively .",
    "note that at @xmath72 no part of the umb crosses the fs .",
    "however , the outer gap is produced by symmetrization of the umb bottom around the fs in the sc state .",
    "such a shift of spectral weight below @xmath10 leads to an enhanced stability of the sc state when the normal state dos has an electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "further insight is obtained from figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a - d ) , which present energy distribution curves ( edcs ) of the an point where the spectral weight is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) . when there is a well - defined electron pocket , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) ( inset ) , the an edc consists of a peak centered at the fermi level ( red dashed curves , which represent the edcs for the non - superconducting state ) however , for @xmath74 , the edc peak lies above @xmath10 , so that the an spectral weight is present only due to peak broadening .",
    "thus , for @xmath75 the umb has not yet crossed the fs and for @xmath71 the band is just beginning to cross . for @xmath69",
    "the fs peak in the af state is split when the sc turns on , and the spectral weight at the fermi energy is greatly reduced .",
    "fs - free superconductivity is reflected in the edcs of fig .",
    "4 before the onset of the tt through the presence of two peaks symmetric about the fermi energy in the sc state ( blue curves ) at both @xmath72 and @xmath71 , even though there are no bands crossing the fermi energy . with increasing doping , as the umb crosses the fermi energy , the fs topology changes with the appearance of antinodal electron pockets centered around @xmath8 . with reference to the spectral weight loss with and without superconductivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , and the results of figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] , we see that after the first tt around @xmath72 , there is a sharp increase in the spectral weight loss .",
    "this weight loss is due to pair formation and is a direct result of the opening of antinodal electron pockets .",
    "it is interesting to note that in order to reproduce the experimental dome in the low - doping regime , the interaction parameter @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) would have to increase rapidly with underdoping below tt1 . while a strong increase of the pairing potential near half - filling has been predicted^28^ , the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) indicates the effects of a more modest increase in @xmath40 . @xmath1",
    "now decreases very rapidly below the first tt , fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , but there is still a range of fs - free superconductivity in fig .  [ fig:4](c ) . to explain the lower part of the experimental sc dome in this scenario",
    ", we would have to postulate that the uniform af+sc phase becomes unstable to nanoscale phase separation ( nps)^29^ , which is sensitive to impurities , and hence could lead to the observed low - energy spin - glass phase and to the opening of an additional , nodal gap .",
    "termination of this nps at tt1 suggests that superconductivity stabilizes the associated @xmath0 magnetic order .",
    "we have shown that fermi - surface - free superconductivity , as previously observed in the pnictides^1,2^ , can also occur in hole doped cuprates .",
    "this occurs near the doping at which topology of the fermi surface changes as an electron pocket appears in the antinodal region , similar to the case of electron doped cuprates^3,4^. the resulting spectral weight loss in the superconducting state is similar to that found in arpes measurements^5^. our results provide evidence for the presence of two topological transitions under the superconducting dome in bi2201 , consistent with the picture of a trisected dome in bi2212 ^ 30^.",
    "our analysis utilizes a mean field tight binding model with a hubbard u along with sc and @xmath0-af order as outlined in equations 2 and 3 .",
    "the sc and af order parameters are calculated self - consistently with equations 5 and 6 . within this framework ,",
    "measurable quantities , such as spectral weight and density of states , can be calculated and analyzed accordingly . with this simple model",
    "we are able to describes the fundamentals of the tt and fs - free sc in hole doped cuprates .",
    "the hopping parameters used here are based on photoemission experiment^13^. we find that the resulting mean - field results are in good agreement with more accurate intermediate - coupling [ quasiparticle - gw^9^ ] results , when the following substitutions are made .",
    "first , the experimental dispersion approximately matches the coherent part of the dressed bands , being renormalized by a factor @xmath76 resulting in the relationship @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the bands fit to experiment and @xmath79 are bands fit to lda calculations .",
    "when considering magnetic order @xmath76 renormalizes the magnetic susceptibility @xmath80 and the hubbard u. this leads to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the effective @xmath16 and @xmath83 is the renormalized susceptibility .",

    "<S> we show that hole - doped cuprates can harbor _ fermi - surface - free superconductivity _ similar to the case of the pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs near the doping at which a new fermi surface pocket appears in the antinodal region . </S>",
    "<S> the change in fermi surface topology is accompanied by a characteristic rise in spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the presence of a trisected superconducting dome , and suggest that superconductivity is responsible for stabilizing the @xmath0 magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> recent arpes studies on pnictides adduce that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 depends sensitively on details of the band structure and fermi surface ( fs)^1^. in particular , proximity of the fs to a band edge and the associated van hove singularity ( vhs ) correlates with significantly enhanced @xmath1 s . </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of ba@xmath2k@xmath3fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ^ 2^ indicates that when a band edge approaches the fs , superconductivity can be observed even before the band crosses the fs . </S>",
    "<S> bang^2^ suggests that this fs - free superconductivity is driven by the shadow bands resulting from the symmetrization of spectral weight around the fermi energy and the formation of a related ` shadow gap ' in the bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this remarkable effect can also arise in the single - band case of the cuprates when the band is split by magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> in the electron doped system it is well known that the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( af ) order can induce two distinct _ ` topological transitions ' _ ( tt s ) with doping^3,4^. at half - filling , the af order splits the band into upper and lower magnetic bands ( u / lmbs ) , and low electron doping moves the fs into the bottom of the umb . as the electron doping increases , the lmb moves up in energy and eventually crosses the fs leading to the emergence of hole pockets around @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first topological transition ( tt1 ) in this system . </S>",
    "<S> the second topological transition ( tt2 ) occurs at higher doping when the electron and hole pockets merge into the single continuous fs of the paramagnetic system .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that a transition similar to tt1 can occur in hole doped cuprates such as ( bi , pb)@xmath6(sr , la)@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( bi2201)^5^. this transition is however different in that the first holes now enter the lmb , so the transition occurs when the umb moves down in energy and crosses the fs , introducing electron pockets around @xmath8 ^ 6,7^. it is near this transition that we find evidence for fs - free d - wave superconductivity . </S>"
