    "the weak localization regime in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the fermi quasimomentum and mean free path , respectively ) , when the electron motion is diffusive , is well understood from theoretical point of view.@xcite in this case the quantum corrections to conductivity , which are caused by electron - electron interaction and interference , are small compared with the drude conductivity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "experimentally , this regime was studied in different types of 2d systems .",
    "qualitative and in some cases quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions was found .",
    "however , important questions remain to be answered : ( i ) what does happen with these corrections at decrease of @xmath13 down to @xmath14 and ( ii ) at decrease of temperature @xmath15 when the quantum corrections become comparable in magnitude with the drude conductivity ?",
    "it is clear that the increase of disorder sooner or later leads to the change of the conductivity mechanism from diffusive one to hopping and another question is : when does it happen ? to answer this question the temperature dependence of the conductivity is analyzed usually .",
    "it is supposed that the transition to the hopping conductivity occurs when the conductivity becomes lower than @xmath16 and the strong temperature dependence arises.@xcite from our point of view , it is not enough to analyze only the @xmath17 dependence .",
    "the low conductivity and its strong temperature dependence can result from large value of the quantum corrections as well .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the role of quantum corrections over wide range of @xmath13 and to understand what happens when the quantum corrections become comparable with the drude conductivity .",
    "we try to answer these questions studying the quantum corrections in the 2d systems with the simplest and well - known electron energy spectrum , starting from the well understandable case @xmath18 .",
    "we report experimental results obtained for gated single quantum well gaas / ingaas / gaas structures with one 2d subband occupied .",
    "an analysis of the experimental data shows that the conductivity is diffusive when @xmath13 varies from @xmath19 to approximately @xmath20 and looks like diffusive one at @xmath21 . at low temperature and @xmath22",
    "the total quantum correction is not small .",
    "it is close in magnitude to the drude conductivity so that the conductivity is significantly less than @xmath23  @xmath24 at low temperature : for instance , for @xmath25 it is about @xmath26  @xmath24 at @xmath3  k , that is six hundred odd times less than @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in this range the strong temperature and magnetic field dependences are caused by the change of quantum corrections .",

    "the samples were mesa etched into standard hall bars with the dimensions @xmath32 mm@xmath33 and then the gate electrode was deposited onto the cap layer by thermal evaporation .",
    "the measurements were performed in the temperature range @xmath34 k at magnetic field @xmath35 up to 6 t. the electron density was found from the hall effect and from the shubnikov - de haas oscillations where it was possible .",

    "k , the value of @xmath128 as a function of @xmath13 is depicted in the fig .",
    "as the figure illustrates , these results match those obtained for @xmath122 and discussed in previous subsection .",

    "the last leads to the fact that at low temperature the conductivity in zero magnetic field is very small fraction of the drude conductivity ( see inset in fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
