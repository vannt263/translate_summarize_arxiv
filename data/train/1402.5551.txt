    "in these lectures we present five interpretations of the fa di bruno formula which computes the @xmath0-th derivative of the composition of two functions of one variable .    1 .",
    "this formula tells explicitly how to compute the composition law in the group of formal diffeomorphisms in one variable .",
    "it is therefore related to the lagrange inversion formula , which computes the inverse of a formal diffeomorphism in this group .",
    "2 .   in terms of hopf algebras , it gives the coproduct of the so - called fa di bruno hopf algebra , which can be seen as the coordinate ring of the previous group .",
    "it is one of the renormalization hopf algebras which appeared recently in quantum field theory , and being related to the composition of formal series it is expected to appear , in its one - variable or several - variables form , in any perturbative theory .",
    "the fa di bruno hopf algebra allows a non - commutative lift , but unlike what happens for the group of invertible formal series endowed with the product law , this non - commutative hopf algebra does not represent a pro - algebraic group as a functor on non - commutative associative algebras .",
    "its nature is then still an open question .",
    "3 .   the lie algebra of the formal diffeomorphisms group is a well - known subalgebra of the witt ( and therefore also of the virasoro ) lie algebra : the fa di bruno formula is therefore related to the well - known lie bracket on these lie algebras .",
    "the fa di bruno hopf algebra is obtained from the lie algebra of the formal diffeomorphisms group by considering the graded dual of its envoloping algebra ( cartier - milnor - moore correspondence ) .",
    "4 .   in combinatorics ,",
    "the fa di bruno hopf algebra is an important example of incidence hopf algebra @xcite .",
    "it is also a right - sided combinatorial hopf algebra @xcite , and therefore its associated lie bracket is the commutator of a brace product",
    ". it would be interesting to extend this brace product to the witt algebra , which is the lie algebra of vector fields on the circle .",
    "5 .   finally , an interpretation of the fa di bruno formula in operadic terms is also possible .",
    "we recall in section [ sect : operad ] the definition of a prounipotent group ( and its corresponding pronilpotent lie algebra ) associated to a large class of linear operad @xcite , the group law being related to the operadic composition .",
    "then , the group of formal diffeomorphisms ( hence the fa di bruno formula ) is the group associated to the operad @xmath1 governing associative algebras .",

    "the `` cavaliere '' francesco fa di bruno was born on march 9 , 1825 , in alessandria ( italy ) , and was the youngest of twelve children .",
    "he died on march 27 , 1888 , in torino ( italy ) .",
    "he joined the military academy of torino at the age of 15 , took part in the first italian independence war in 1848 , and then went to paris for two years , during which he studied mathematics with augustin - louis cauchy and with the astronomer urbain jean joseph le verrier . back in torino , he left the army in 1853 .",
    "he gave mathematics lectures at torino university and at the military academy , and was appointed professor in 1876 .",
    "besides his official teaching and research job , he carried out a lot of scientific and human activities such as mechanics ( he invented , among other things , an electric alarm clock for his blind sister ) , music , and , above all , social and philanthropic activities inspired by his christian faith .",
    "he became a catholic priest in 1876 , and was beatified by john - paul ii in 1988 for his courageous fight against the hard living conditions of female workers in torino in the 19th century .",

    "let us consider the set of smooth functions in one variable , endowed with the composition .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are smooth functions of @xmath4 , their composition is the smooth function @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 .",
    "the fa di bruno formula tells how to compute the @xmath0-th derivative of the composite function @xmath5 in terms of the derivatives of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this famous formula was published by f.  fa di bruno in the dense two - page paper `` _ sullo sviluppo delle funzioni _ '' in 1855 @xcite , and says that @xmath7 where the second sum is taken over the non - negative integers @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath11 , there are three possible sequences of such numbers : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . then @xmath15    the most direct approach at this stage is to prove directly by induction on @xmath0 .",
    "although it does not show particular difficulties , it is rather cumbersome .",
    "a very elegant alternative proof of can be found in @xcite ( proposition 8.3.4 therein ) , which heuristically goes as follows : we can extend any smooth function @xmath2 to a smooth functional @xmath16 from @xmath17 $ ] to @xmath17 $ ] by taylor expansion : @xmath18 functionals like @xmath19 can be seen as smooth functions depending on the infinite set of variables @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "set now @xmath22 for short and collect all the powers @xmath23 in the formal translation operator @xmath24 .",
    "the crucial properties : @xmath25 together yield : @xmath26 formula is then obtained by taking @xmath27 times the coefficient of @xmath28 in above .",
    "formula is valid in greater generality , replacing @xmath29 with any derivation @xmath30 , with @xmath31 now standing for @xmath32 .",
    "+ in order to make the proof above completely rigorous , we have to prove properties and .",
    "a proof of these can be found in @xcite , based uniquely on formal - variable calculus ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2.1 , 2.2 , 8.18.3 ) ) .",
    "one far - reaching application of this formal - variable calculus is the associativity principle for lattice vertex operators ( @xcite , equation ( 8.4.32 ) , theorem 8.4.2 , theorem 8.8.9 and proposition 8.10.5 ) .",
    "we wo nt go further into this direction , referring the interested reader to @xcite for an introduction to the theory of vertex operator algebras . see also @xcite for a different approach to this vast topic .",
    "+ our interpretation of the formal variable argument alluded to above is the following : for any taylor expansion functional @xmath33 as above , where @xmath34 is a smooth function , and for any @xmath35 $ ] we have : @xmath36 the case @xmath37 is a simple rephrasing of the definition , and the case for general @xmath38 follows easily . taking the linear part with respect to @xmath39 in successively for @xmath40 ,",
    "we get an explicit expression for the differential @xmath41 of @xmath42 at @xmath38 in terms of @xmath43 $ ] . namely , for any @xmath44 : @xmath45=y^k df(t)[\\partial_0].\\ ] ] we can identify @xmath17 $ ] with its tangent space at each point @xmath38 , via @xmath46 .",
    "we have then a coordinate - free formulation of : @xmath47=s.df(t)[\\partial_0]\\ ] ] for any @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "conversely , any smooth functional @xmath49\\to\\mathbb r[[y]]$ ] which satisfies also satisfies the following identities involving higher - order differentials : @xmath50=s_1\\cdots s_r.d^rf(t)[\\partial_{0},\\ldots,\\partial_{0}].\\ ] ] writing down the taylor formula for the one - variable function @xmath51 we see that implies .",
    "hence any @xmath42 verifying can be written as @xmath33 , with @xmath52 for any @xmath53 .",

    "property follows immediately : @xmath60 surprisingly enough , f. fa di bruno wrote this formula almost a century after a similar one was established : the equally famous lagrange inversion formula of 1770 @xcite , which computes the compositional inverse of a smooth function .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two smooth functions , inverse to each other , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then lagrange s inversion formula says that , for @xmath65 in a neighborhood of zero , @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath68 , this formula allows us to compute @xmath4 as @xmath69 because @xmath70 the series defines lambert s w - function on its domain of convergence , with radius of convergence equal to @xmath71 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the logarithm , this function admits a multivalued analytic extension to the whole complex plane with @xmath71 removed .    in the two - page paper @xcite , fa di",
    "bruno also expresses @xmath72 as the determinant of the following @xmath73 matrix : @xmath74 unlike the fa di bruno formula ( [ fdb - formula ] ) , this beautiful matrix formula seemingly did not get any echo among mathematicians , nor any further development .",
    "it has been pointed out that formula was certainly known before fa di bruno s paper @xcite : quoting w.  p.  johnson @xcite , several formulas of the same type were established in the middle of the 19th century , by hoppe ( 1845 ) , meyer ( 1847 ) , j.f.c .",

    "rota @xcite propose a purely combinatorial formulation of fa di bruno s formula : @xmath77 where the second sum is taken over the partitions of @xmath78 with @xmath79 blocks having @xmath80 blocks with @xmath81 elements .",

    "the proof of the frucht - rota formula starting from riordan s formula resides in the following combinatorial interpretation of the bell polynomials : the coefficient of @xmath90 in @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 ) is equal to the number of partitions of a set of cardinality @xmath0 with @xmath93 blocks of size @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( and therefore @xmath79 blocks altogether ) .",
    "the composition of functions of one variable is an associative operation , for which the identity @xmath96 is the unit .",
    "therefore the set of smooth functions which have a compositional inverse forms a group , called the group of smooth diffeomorphisms on the real line , and denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "groups of diffeomorphisms on a manifold are infinite dimensional groups , not locally compact , with many connected components classified by the mapping class group . even for the simplest ones , like @xmath97 or @xmath98 ,",
    "very little is known .    up to composition by a translation , a diffeomorphism on the real line fixes the origin . up to a scalar factor",
    ", one can also assume that a diffeomorphism is tangent to the identity at the fixed point .",
    "in other words , the group of diffeomorphisms of the real line is the semi - direct product of the group of diffeomorphisms tangent to the identity by the group of affine transformations .",
    "thinking in terms of taylor expansions , we will rather consider the group of _ formal _ diffeomorphisms tangent to the identity : @xmath99,\\ f_0=0\\hbox { and } f_1=1 \\big\\},\\ ] ] whose definition makes sense for any field @xmath100 of characteristic zero .",
    "fa di bruno s formula then expresses the @xmath0-th coefficient of the series @xmath5 in terms of the coefficients of @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath101 where the second sum runs over @xmath0-uples @xmath102 of non - negative integers such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in terms of bell",
