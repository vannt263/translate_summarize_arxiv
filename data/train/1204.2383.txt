    "the mechanism of heavy meson decays is one of the most interesting and challenging fields in particle physics , it involves both strong and weak interactions .",

    "pure - leptonic decay of heavy meson can be used to determine the decay constant , which describes the possibility - amplitude for the quark - untiquark emerging at the same point .",
    "the pure - leptonic decay is helicity suppressed .",

    ", the radiative leptonic decay can be as large as , or even larger than the pure - leptonic decay mode .",
    "it thus opens a window for detecting the dynamics of strong interaction in the heavy meson or studying the effect of strong interaction in the decay .",
