    "in the early 1900s , bernstein  @xcite asked the following question : given a collection of subsets of a set @xmath3 , is there a partition of @xmath3 into @xmath4 such that no subset is contained in either @xmath5 or @xmath6 ?",
    "if we think of the elements of @xmath3 as vertices and of each subset as a hyperedge , the question can be rephrased as whether a given hypergraph can be 2-colored so that no hyperedge is monochromatic . of particular interest",
    "is the setting where all hyperedges contain @xmath0 vertices , @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "this question was popularized by erds  who dubbed it `` property b '' in honor of bernstein  and has motivated some of the deepest advances in probabilistic combinatorics . indeed , determining the smallest number of hyperedges in a non-2-colorable @xmath0-uniform hypergraph remains one of the most important problems in extremal graph theory , perhaps second only to the ramsey problem  @xcite .",
    "a more modern problem , with a somewhat similar flavor , is boolean satisfiability : given a cnf formula @xmath7 , is it possible to assign truth values to the variables of @xmath7 so that it evaluates to true ?",
    "satisfiability has been the central problem of computational complexity since 1971 when cook  @xcite proved that it is complete for the class np .",
    "the case where all clauses have the same size @xmath0 is known as @xmath0-sat and is np - complete for all @xmath8 .    for both @xmath0-sat and property b",
    "it is common to generate random instances by selecting a corresponding structure at random . indeed ,",
    "random formulas and random hypergraphs have been studied extensively in probabilistic combinatorics in the last three decades .",
    "while there are a number of slightly different models for generating such structures  uniformly at random \" , we will see that results transfer readily between them . for the sake of concreteness , let @xmath9 denote a formula chosen uniformly among all @xmath10 formulas on @xmath11 variables with @xmath12 clauses .",
    "similarly , let @xmath13 denote a hypergraph chosen uniformly among all @xmath14 hypergraphs with @xmath11 vertices and @xmath12 hyperedges .",
    "we will say that a sequence of events @xmath15 occurs _ with high probability _",
    "( ) if @xmath16 = 1 $ ] and _ with uniformly positive probability _",
    "( ) if @xmath17 > 0 $ ] . throughout the paper",
    ", @xmath0 will be arbitrarily large but fixed .    in recent years , both problems have been understood to undergo a `` phase transition '' as the ratio of constraints to variables passes through a critical threshold .",
    "that is , for a given number of vertices ( variables ) , the probability that a random instance has a solution drops rapidly from 1 to 0 around a critical number of hyperedges ( clauses ) .",
    "this sharp threshold phenomenon was discovered in the early 1990s , when several researchers  @xcite performed computational experiments on @xmath18 and found that while for @xmath19 almost all formulas are satisfiable , for @xmath20 almost all are unsatisfiable .",
    "moreover , as @xmath11 increases , this transition narrows around @xmath21 . along with similar results for other fixed @xmath8",
    "this has led to the following popular conjecture :    * satisfiability threshold conjecture : * _ for each @xmath22 , there exists a constant @xmath23 such that _ @xmath24= \\begin{cases } 1 & \\mbox{if $ r < r_k$}\\\\ 0 & \\mbox{if $ r > r_k$ } \\enspace . \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    in the last ten years , this conjecture has become an active area of interdisciplinary research , receiving attention in theoretical computer science , artificial intelligence , combinatorics and , more recently , statistical physics .",
    "much of the work on random @xmath0-sat has focused on proving upper and lower bounds for @xmath23 , both for the smallest computationally hard case @xmath25 and for general @xmath0 . at this point",
    "the existence of @xmath23 has not been established for any @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , we will take the liberty of writing @xmath26 to denote that for all @xmath27 , @xmath28 is  satisfiable ; analogously , we will write @xmath29 to denote that for all @xmath30 , @xmath28 is  unsatisfiable .    as we will see , an elementary counting argument yields @xmath31 for all @xmath0 .",
    "lower bounds , on the other hand , have been exclusively algorithmic : to establish @xmath26 ones shows that for @xmath27 some specific algorithm finds a satisfying assignment with probability we will see that an extremely simple algorithm  @xcite already yields @xmath32 .",
    "we will also see that while more sophisticated algorithms improve this bound slightly , to date no algorithm is known to find a satisfying truth assignment ( even ) when @xmath33 , for any @xmath34 .",
    "the threshold picture for hypergraph 2-colorability is completely analogous : for each @xmath8 , it is conjectured that there exists a constant @xmath35 such that @xmath36= \\begin{cases } 1 & \\mbox{if $ c < c_k$}\\\\ 0 & \\mbox{if $ c > c_k$ } \\enspace . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the same counting argument here implies @xmath37 , while another simple algorithm yields @xmath38 .",
    "again , no algorithm is known to improve this bound asymptotically , leaving a multiplicative gap of order @xmath39 between the upper and lower bound for this problem as well .    in this paper",
    ", we use the _ second moment method _ to show that random @xmath0-cnf formulas are satisfiable , and random @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs are 2-colorable , for density up to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we determine the threshold for random @xmath0-sat within a factor of two and the threshold for property b within a small additive constant .",
    "recall that @xmath41 is  unsatisfiable if @xmath42 .",
    "our first main result is    [ thm : ksat ] for all @xmath22 , @xmath43 is satisfiable if @xmath44 .",
    "our second main result determines the property b threshold within an additive @xmath45 .",
    "[ thm : hyp ] for all @xmath22 , @xmath46 is  non-2-colorable if @xmath47 there exists a sequence @xmath48 such that for all @xmath22 , @xmath46 is  2-colorable if @xmath49    the upper bound in   corresponds to the density for which the expected number of 2-colorings of @xmath50 is @xmath51 .",
    "our main contribution is inequality   which we prove using the second moment method .",
    "in fact , our approach yields explicit bounds for the hypergraph 2-colorability threshold for each value of @xmath0 ( although ones that lack an attractive closed form ) .",
    "we give the first few of these bounds in table  [ tab : val ] .",
    "we see that the gap between our upper and lower bounds converges to its limiting value of @xmath52 rather rapidly .",
    "[ tab : val ] @xmath53    unlike the algorithmic lower bounds for random @xmath0-sat and hypergraph 2-colorability , our arguments are non - constructive : we establish that  solutions exist for certain densities but do not offer any hint on how to find them .",
    "we believe that abandoning the algorithmic approach for proving such lower bounds is natural and , perhaps , necessary . at a minimum ,",
    "the algorithmic approach is limited to the small set of rather naive algorithms whose analysis is tractable using current techniques . perhaps more gravely , it could be that _ no _ polynomial algorithm can overcome the @xmath54 barrier .",
    "determining whether this is true even for certain limited classes of algorithms , random walk algorithms , is a very interesting open problem .",
    "in addition , by not seeking out some specific truth assignment , as algorithms do , the second moment method gives some first glimpses of the `` geometry '' of the set of solutions .",
    "deciphering these first glimpses , getting clearer ones , and exploring potential interactions between the geometry of the set of solutions and computational hardness are great challenges lying ahead .",
    "we note that recently , and independently , frieze and wormald  @xcite applied the second moment method to random @xmath0-sat in the case where @xmath0 is a moderately growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , they proved that when @xmath55 , @xmath9 is  satisfiable if @xmath56 but  unsatisfiable if @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is such that @xmath60 .",
    "their result follows by a direct application of the second moment method to the number of satisfying assignments of @xmath9 . as we will see shortly , while this approach gives a very sharp bound when @xmath61 , it fails for any fixed @xmath0 and indeed for any @xmath62 .",
    "we also note that since this work first appeared  @xcite , the line of attack we put forward has had several other successful applications .",
    "specifically , in  @xcite , the lower bound for the random @xmath0-sat threshold was improved to @xmath63 by building on the insights presented here . in  @xcite",
    ", the method was successfully extended to random max @xmath0-sat",
    "@xcite , while in  @xcite it was applied to random graph coloring .",
    "we discuss these subsequent developments in the conclusions .",
    "the version of the second moment method we will use is given by lemma  [ lem : sec ] below and follows from a direct application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality ( see remark 3.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "[ lem : sec ] for any non - negative random variable @xmath64 , @xmath65 \\,\\ge\\ , \\frac{\\ex[x]^2}{\\ex[x^2 ] } \\enspace .\\ ] ]    it is natural to try to apply lemma  [ lem : sec ] to random @xmath0-sat by letting @xmath64 be the number of satisfying truth assignments of @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , as we will see , this  naive \" application of the second moment method fails rather dramatically : for all @xmath66 and every @xmath67 , @xmath68 > ( 1+\\beta)^n \\,\\ex[x]^2 $ ] for some @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "the second moment method only gives an exponentially small lower bound on the probability of satisfiability .",
    "the key step in overcoming this failure lies in realizing that we are free to apply the second moment method to any random variable @xmath64 such that @xmath70 implies that the formula is satisfiable .",
    "in particular , we can let @xmath64 be the size of any _ subset _ of the set of satisfying assignments . by choosing this subset carefully ,",
    "we can hope to significantly reduce the variance of @xmath64 relative to its expectation and use lemma  [ lem : sec ] to prove that the subset is frequently non - empty .",
    "indeed , we will establish the satisfiability of random @xmath0-cnf by focusing on those satisfying truth assignments _ whose complement is also satisfying_. in section  [ sec : crapola ] we will give some intuition for why the number of such assignments has much smaller variance than the number of all satisfying assignments . for",
    "now , we observe that considering only such satisfying assignments is equivalent to interpreting the random @xmath0-cnf formula @xmath9 as an instance of not - all - equal ( nae ) @xmath0-sat , where a truth assignment @xmath71 is a solution if and only if under @xmath71 every clause contains at least one satisfied literal _ and _ at least one unsatisfied literal . in other words , our lower bound for the @xmath0-sat threshold in theorem  [ thm : ksat ] is , in fact , a lower bound for the nae @xmath0-sat threshold .    indeed ,",
    "for both random nae @xmath0-sat and random hypergraph 2-colorability we will apply lemma  [ lem : sec ] naively , by letting @xmath64 be the number of solutions",
    ". this will give theorem  [ thm : hyp ] and the values in table  [ tab : val ] for hypergraph 2-colorability and , as we will see , exactly the same bounds for random nae @xmath0-sat .",
    "( indeed , the proof of theorem  [ thm : hyp ] is a slight generalization of the proof for random nae @xmath0-sat . )",
    "we will see that this success of the naive second moment is due to the symmetry inherent in both problems , to the fact that the complement of a solution is also a solution .",
    "indeed , we feel that highlighting this role of symmetry  and showing how it can be exploited even in asymmetric problems like @xmath0-sat  is our main conceptual contribution .",
    "exploiting these ideas in other constraint satisfaction problems that have a permutation group acting on the variables domain is an interesting area for further research .      in section  [ sec : back ] we give some background on random @xmath0-sat and random hypergraph 2-colorability . in section  [ sec : crapola ]",
    "we explain why the second moment method fails when applied to @xmath0-sat directly , and give some intuition for why counting only the nae - satisfying assignments rectifies the problem .",
    "we also point out some connections to methods of statistical physics . in section  [ sec :",
    "ground ] we lay the groundwork for bounding the second moment for both nae @xmath0-sat and hypergraph 2-colorability by dealing with some probabilistic preliminaries , introducing a ",
    "laplace method \" lemma for bounding certain sums , and outlining our strategy .",
    "the actual bounding occurs in sections  [ sec : nae_bound ] to  [ sec : gleas ] .",
    "specifically , in sections  [ sec : nae_bound ] and  [ sec : hyp ] we use the laplace lemma to reduce the second moment calculations for both random nae @xmath0-sat and random hypergraph 2-colorability to the maximization of a certain function @xmath72 on the unit interval , where @xmath72 is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "we maximize @xmath72 in section  [ sec : gleas ] and prove the laplace lemma in section  [ sec : peak ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] by discussing some recent extensions of this work and proposing several open questions .",
    "the mathematical investigation of random @xmath0-sat began with the work of franco and paull  @xcite who , among other results , observed that @xmath43 is  unsatisfiable if @xmath73 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath74 be the number of all possible @xmath0-clauses and let @xmath75 be the number of @xmath0-clauses consistent with a given truth assignment . since any fixed truth assignment is satisfying with probability @xmath76 , the expected number of satisfying truth assignments of @xmath43 is at most @xmath77^n = o(1)$ ] for @xmath78 .    shortly afterwards , chao and franco  @xcite complemented this result by proving that for all @xmath22 , if @xmath79 then the following linear - time algorithm , called unit clause ( uc ) , finds a satisfying truth assignment : if there exist unit clauses , pick one randomly and satisfy it ;",
    "else pick a random unset variable and give it a random value .",
    "note that since uc succeeds only  ( rather than ) this does not imply a lower bound for @xmath23 .",
    "the satisfiability threshold conjecture gained a great deal of popularity in the early 1990s and has received an increasing amount of attention since then .",
    "the polynomial - time solvable case @xmath80 was settled early on : independently , chvtal and reed  @xcite , fernandez de la vega  @xcite , and goerdt  @xcite proved that @xmath81 .",
    "chvtal and reed  @xcite , in addition to proving @xmath81 , gave the first lower bound for @xmath23 , strengthening the positive - probability result of chao and franco  @xcite by analyzing the following refinement of uc , called short clause ( sc ) : if there exist unit clauses , pick one randomly and satisfy it ; else if there exist binary clauses , pick one randomly and satisfy a random literal in it ; else pick a random unset variable and give it a random value .",
    "in  @xcite , the authors showed that for all @xmath82 , sc finds a satisfying truth assignment  for @xmath83 and raised the question of whether this lower bound for @xmath23 can be improved asymptotically .",
    "a large fraction of the work on the satisfiability threshold conjecture since then has been devoted to the first computationally hard case , @xmath25 , and a long series of results  @xcite has narrowed the potential range of @xmath84 .",
    "currently this is pinned between @xmath85 by kaporis , kirousis and lalas  @xcite and hajiaghayi and sorkin  @xcite and @xmath86 by dubois and boufkhad  @xcite .",
    "upper bounds for @xmath84 come from probabilistic counting arguments , refining the above calculation of the expected number of satisfying assignments .",
    "lower bounds , on the other hand , have come from analyzing progressively more sophisticated algorithms .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these approaches helps narrow the asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for @xmath23 .",

    "finally , we note that if one chooses to live unencumbered by the burden of mathematical proof , powerful non - rigorous techniques of statistical physics , such as the `` replica method '' , become available .",

    "their argument is mathematically sophisticated but far from rigorous . in particular",
    ", they argue that as @xmath0 grows large , the so - called _ annealed approximation _ should apply .",
    "this creates an analogy with the second moment method which we discuss in section  [ sec : replica ] .",

    "the crucial difference is that now the correlation function @xmath163 is _ symmetric _ around @xmath52 and , hence , so is @xmath164 . as a result",
    ", the entropy - correlation product @xmath164 always has a local extremum at @xmath52 . moreover , since the entropic term is always maximized at @xmath165 and is independent of @xmath148 , for sufficiently small @xmath148 this extremum is a global maximum . with these considerations in mind , in fig .  2 we plot @xmath166 for @xmath147 and various values of @xmath148 .",
    "let us start with the picture on the left , where @xmath148 increases from 8 to 12 as we go from top to bottom .",
    "for @xmath167 we see that indeed @xmath164 has a global maximum at @xmath52 and the second moment method succeeds . for the cases @xmath168 , on the other hand , we see that @xmath162 is actually a global minimum .",
    "in fact , we see that @xmath169 , implying that @xmath142 ^ 2 = \\lambda_n(1/2)^n =   o(1)$ ] and so  there are no nae - satisfying assignments for such @xmath148 .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath170 , even though @xmath171 , the second moment is exponentially large ( since @xmath172 near @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) .",
    "[ fig_nae ]    @xmath147 , @xmath175 ( top to bottom )    @xmath147 , @xmath176    the most interesting case is @xmath177 . here @xmath178 is a local maximum and greater than 1 , but the two global maxima occur at @xmath179 and @xmath180 where the function equals @xmath181 ... as a result , again , the second moment method only gives an exponentially small lower bound on @xmath182 $ ] .",
    "note that this is in spite of the fact that @xmath142 $ ] is now exponentially large .",
    "indeed , the largest value for which the second moment succeeds for @xmath147 is @xmath183 when the two side peaks reach the same height as the peak at @xmath52 ( see the plot on the right in fig .  2 ) .",
    "so , the situation can be summarized as follows .",
    "by requiring that we only count nae - satisfying truth assignments we make it , roughly , twice as hard to satisfy each clause .",
    "this manifests itself in the additional factor of 2 in the middle term of @xmath163 compared to @xmath135 . on the other hand , now , the third term of @xmath184 , capturing ",
    "joint \" behavior , is symmetric around @xmath52 , making @xmath185 itself symmetric around @xmath52 .",
    "this enables the second moment method which , indeed , only breaks down when the density gets within an additive constant of the upper bound for the nae @xmath0-sat threshold .",
    "given a truth assignment @xmath71 and an arbitrary cnf formula @xmath7 , let @xmath186 denote the total number of literal _ occurrences _ in @xmath7 satisfied by @xmath71 .",
    "so , for example , @xmath187 is maximized by those truth assignments that assign every variable its `` majority '' value . with this definition at hand , a potential explanation of how symmetry reduces the variance is suggested by considering the following trivial refinement of our generative model : first i ) draw @xmath115 i.i.d .",
    "uniformly random literals just as before and then ii ) partition the drawn literals randomly into @xmath0-clauses ( rather than assuming that the first @xmath0 literals form the first clause , the next @xmath0 the second , etc . ) .",
    "in particular , imagine that we have just finished performing the first generative step above and we are about to perform the second .",
    "observe that at this point the value of @xmath187 has already been determined for every @xmath188 .",
    "moreover , for each fixed @xmath71 the conditional probability of yielding a satisfying assignment corresponds to a balls - in - bins experiment : distribute @xmath189 balls in @xmath12 bins , each with capacity @xmath0 , so that every bin receives at least one ball .",
    "it is clear that those truth assignments for which @xmath187 is large at the end of the first step have a big advantage in the second .",
    "to get an idea of what @xmath187 typically looks like on @xmath190 we begin by observing that the number of occurrences of a fixed literal @xmath191 , @xmath192 , is distributed as @xmath193 .",
    "thus , @xmath194 = o(1)$ ] and , moreover , the random variables @xmath192 are very weakly correlated . as a result ,",
    "at the end of the first step , @xmath187 is typically a very smooth function on @xmath190 , attaining a maximum value at the subcube of majority vote assignments and gradually decreasing away from them .",
    "thus , at the end of the first step the  more promising \" truth assignments are correlated : in satisfying many literal occurrences ( thus increasing their odds for the second step ) , they tend to overlap with each other ( and the majority assignment ) at more than half the variables .",
    "in contrast , if we focus on nae - satisfying assignments , at the end of the first step the most promising assignments @xmath71 are those for which @xmath189 is very close to its average value @xmath195 .",
    "so , when the problem is symmetric , the typical case becomes the most favorable case and the clustering around truth assignments that satisfy many literal occurrences disappears .",
    "if indeed `` populism '' , the tendency of each variable to assume its majority value in the formula , is the main source of correlations in random @xmath0-sat , then the second moment method is a good candidate for @xmath0-cnf models which do not encourage this tendency .",
    "for example , one such model is _ regular _ random @xmath0-sat , in which every literal occurs exactly the same number of times .",
    "such formulas can be analyzed using a model analogous to the configuration model of random graphs , by taking precisely @xmath196 copies of each literal and partitioning the resulting @xmath197 copies into clauses randomly ( exactly as in the second step of our two - step model for random @xmath0-sat ) .",
    "a key quantity in statistical physics is the _ overlap distribution _ between configurations of minimum energy , known as ground states .",
    "when a constraint satisfaction problem is satisfiable , ground states correspond to solutions , such as satisfying assignments , 2-colorings , and so on . in the case of random , the overlap distribution is the probability @xmath198 that a random pair of satisfying assignments have overlap @xmath199 .",
    "this overlap distribution gives an intriguing interpretation of our results . in writing @xmath68",
    "$ ] as a sum of contributions from pairs of assignments with different overlaps , we have in fact calculated the average of @xmath198 over all formulas , weighted by the number of pairs of satisfying assignments of each one .",
    "physicists call this weighted average the `` annealed approximation '' of @xmath198 , and denote it @xmath200 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , while the annealed approximation clearly overemphasizes formulas with more satisfying assignments , monasson and zecchina conjectured in  @xcite , based on the replica method , that it becomes asymptotically tight as @xmath201 .    on a more rigorous footing",
    ", it is easy to see that in our case @xmath200 is proportional to @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath185 is peaked at @xmath52 , @xmath200 is tightly peaked around @xmath52 , since @xmath202 vanishes for all other values of @xmath203 as @xmath204 .",
    "this is precisely what we prove occurs in random for densities up to @xmath205 . in other words , for densities",
    "almost all the way to the random nae @xmath0-sat threshold , in the annealed approximation , the nae - satisfying assignments are scattered throughout the hypercube _ as if they were independent . _",
    "note that even if @xmath198 is concentrated around 1/2 ( rather than just @xmath200 ) this still allows for a typical geometry where there are exponentially many , exponentially large clusters , each centered at a random assignment .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the picture suggested by some very recent , ground - breaking work of mezard , parisi , and zecchina  @xcite , based on non - rigorous techniques of statistical physics .",
    "if this is indeed the true picture , establishing it rigorously would require considerations much more refined than the second moment of the number of solutions . more generally , getting a better understanding of the typical geometry and its potential implications for algorithms appears to us a very challenging and very important open problem .",
    "given a set @xmath3 of @xmath11 boolean variables , let @xmath206 denote the set of all proper _ @xmath0-clauses _ on @xmath3 , the set of all @xmath207 disjunctions of @xmath0 literals involving distinct variables .",
    "similarly , given a set @xmath3 of @xmath11 vertices , let @xmath208 be the set of all @xmath209 @xmath0-subsets of @xmath3 . as we saw , a random @xmath0-cnf formula @xmath9 is formed by selecting uniformly a random @xmath12-subset of @xmath210 , while a random @xmath0-uniform hypergraph @xmath13 is formed by selecting uniformly a random @xmath12-subset of @xmath211 .",
    "while @xmath9 and @xmath13 are perhaps the most natural models for generating random @xmath0-cnf formulas and random @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs , respectively , there are a number of slight variations of each model .",
    "those are largely motivated by amenability to certain calculations . to simplify the discussion we focus on models for random formulas in the rest of this subsection .",
    "all our comments transfer readily to models for random hypergraphs .",
    "for example , it is fairly common to consider the clauses as ordered @xmath0-tuples ( rather than as @xmath0-sets ) and/or to allow replacement in sampling the set @xmath210 .",
    "clearly , for properties such as satisfiability the issue of ordering is irrelevant .",
    "moreover , as long as @xmath212 , essentially the same is true for the issue of replacement . to see that ,",
    "observe that  the number of repeated clauses is @xmath213 and the subset of @xmath214 distinct clauses is uniformly random .",
    "thus , if a monotone decreasing property ( such as satisfiability ) holds with probability @xmath215 for a given @xmath216 when replacement is allowed , it holds with probability @xmath217 for all @xmath27 when replacement is not allowed .",
    "the issue of selecting the literals of each clause with replacement ( which might result in some  improper \" clauses ) is completely analogous .",
    "that is , the probability that a variable appears more than once in a given clause is at most @xmath218 and hence  there are @xmath219 improper clauses .",
    "finally , we note that by standard techniques our results also transfer to the @xmath220 model where every clause appears independently of all others with probability @xmath215 . for that it suffices to set @xmath215 such that @xmath221 .",
