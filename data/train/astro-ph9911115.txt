    "our view of the large  scale distribution of luminous objects in the universe has changed dramatically during the last 25 years : from the simple pre1975 picture of a distribution of `` field '' and `` cluster '' galaxies , to the discovery of the first single superstructures and voids , to the most recent results showing an almost regular web  like network of interconnected clusters , filaments and walls , separating huge nearly  empty volumes .",
    "the increased efficiency of redshift surveys , made possible by the development of fast spectrographs and  especially in the last decade  by an enormous increase in their multiplexing gain ( i.e.the ability to collect spectra of several galaxies at once ) , has allowed us not only to do _",
    "cartography _ of the nearby universe , but also to statistically characterise some of its properties . at the same time ,",
    "parallel advances in the theoretical modeling of the development of structure , with large high  resolution gravitational simulations coupled to a deeper  yet limited  understanding of how to form galaxies within dark ",
    "matter halos , have provided a more realistic connection of the models to the observable quantities . despite the large uncertainties that still exist ,",
    "this has transformed the study of cosmology and large  scale structure into a truly quantitative science , where theory and observations can progress side by side .",
    "i have been asked by the organizers of the 19@xmath5 texas symposium to review this progress , and this paper is the result of this effort .",
    "it is clearly impossible , and actually beyond the scope of a review this size , to provide a thorough and complete summary of all the work done in the field of large  scale structure during this intense period of growth .",
    "there are a number of excellent reviews that appeared in the literature in recent years , from which the interested reader can build his / her own personal and more comprehensive view of the historical development of this relatively young branch of cosmology . if i were to suggest a pedagogical tour on this subject , i would personally start with rood @xcite , who provides an enthusiastic first - hand description of the early pioneering years . within this paper ,",
    "the reader can find all the relevant references to almost anything done before its publication .",
    "i would then continue with geller & huchra @xcite , and giovanelli & haynes @xcite , who give a summary of the important work done during the eighties , which saw the completion of the cfa1 survey by davis and collaborators , its extension ( cfa2 ) , as well as the perseus - pisces @xcite survey .",
    "more recently , strauss & willick @xcite provide a tutorial about the study of both the distribution and motions of galaxies , while in borgani @xcite one can find a thorough introduction to several statistics applied to the distribution of galaxies .",
    "further updates , including early descriptions of projects which are also discussed here in a more advanced stage of development , are given by guzzo @xcite , strauss @xcite , and more recently by chincarini & guzzo @xcite and da costa @xcite .",
    "here , i will try and elaborate on a few selected highlights , in the attempt of clarifying  or at least giving a hint of  what we know and what we do not seem to understand yet concerning the properties and the origin of large  scale structure .",
    "emphasis will be on the ideas , and i hope my colleagues will forgive me if the discussion is not always as rigorous as it might formally be .",
    "even if this can not be a comprehensive review paper , i have done my best to be as complete as possible in terms of at least mentioning the most relevant work done or in progress , with a proper link to a corresponding paper ( or web page ) .",
    "conversely , i have also tried , whenever possible , to recall the basic concepts required to make the discussion as self  contained as possible .",
    "obviously , the topic selection reflects my personal taste , interests , and ignorance , so i apologise in advance to all colleagues whose work i might have overlooked texas symposium in december 1998 , i found it appropriate to include also a few references to works that appeared till march 1999 . ] .    unless differently specified , throughout the paper the hubble constant will be parameterised as h@xmath6 mpc@xmath7 , and a model with q@xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "will be adopted .",
    "how well do we know the global picture , the `` geography '' of large - scale structure ? at the very basic level , any theory of large - scale structure and galaxy formation must be able to reproduce the visual appearance of the large - scale galaxy distribution .",
    "for this reason the first result of a redshift survey is essentially a map of the galaxy distribution in space .",
    "more than for the sometimes complicated statistical analyses that can be computed from them , these maps are what redshift surveys become usually famous for ( many of us certainly remember the coma region  homunculus \" of the first cfa2 slice @xcite ) . for this reason and",
    "possibly because this responds to the need of human beings to `` see '' where they stand within the universe , we like so much to produce `` cone '' or `` wedge '' diagrams : something that was just a picture over the sky vault , for the first time is seen in its almost real spatial distribution thanks to the newly measured distances . such a feeling has probably something in common with that of ancient explorers , when they discovered a new piece of territory not previously marked on the maps .",
    "however , there is at least one major difference to this romantic view .",
    "in fact , when we start a redshift survey , we inevitably have to know in advance that a galaxy is there , with its right ascension , declination and apparent magnitude or flux in some band of the electromagnetic spectrum . a necessary prerequisite for any redshift survey",
    "is , in other words , the availability of a _ photometric catalogue _ , from which an apparent  magnitude ( or flux ) limited sample can be extracted .",
    "this introduces an unavoidable prejudicial selection effect that determines _ how _ our survey will trace the large  scale distribution of matter . in this paper",
    ", we shall come back several times to this concept , which is becoming more and more important now that large redshift surveys are starting to explore depths to which the issues of galaxy evolution can no longer be reasonably ignored .",
    "the cfa1 @xcite , cfa2 @xcite and perseus ",
    "pisces @xcite redshift surveys , for example , were all possible in their era because fritz zwicky and collaborators had previously constructed a catalogue of galaxy positions and magnitudes down to a photographic magnitude @xmath11 over the whole northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "when , for example , the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs , to @xmath12 and ssrs2 , to @xmath13 , see @xcite )  which aimed at being the southern equivalent of the cfa survey  was started , a major difficulty involved the construction of a `` quasi - zwicky '' magnitude  limited sample homogeneous to the northern one from the catalogues available in the south ( essentially the eso ",
    "uppsala diameter  limited catalogue , @xcite ) . ) , with the 1degree `` century survey''@xcite , required the scanning and calibration of red poss ",
    "e plates to build the parent photometric catalogue . ]",
    "the matching of the two surveys ( cfa2 and ssrs2 ) , produced a sample of more than 15,000 galaxies with measured redshift which still is the most representative description of the details of the large  scale distribution of bright galaxies within the local @xmath14 volume .",
    "this can be appreciated from the cone diagram of figure  [ cfa - ssrs ] , where a @xmath15 slice through these combined data is reproduced from @xcite .    the cosmological importance of large , homogeneously  selected photometric catalogues of galaxies was certainly first appreciated ( or at least first translated into a concrete effort ) , by the british astronomical community . at the end of the eighties two different groups in the uk started independently to scan , analyse and calibrate through dedicated ccd photometry the iiia - j plates of the uk ",
    "schmidt survey .",
    "the two projects used the automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine in cambridge and the cosmos machine in edinburgh , respectively , and their final products are represented by the well  known apm galaxy catalogue @xcite and edinburgh  durham southern galaxy catalogue ( edsgc ) , @xcite .",
    "the realization of a similar catalogue in the northern hemisphere has not been possible till the present , due to the lower depth of the palomar survey plates , but is now becoming a reality with the completion and analysis of the deeper possii survey @xcite .",
    "the apm catalogue covers 1.3 sr in the southern hemisphere ( 185 schmidt plates ) , while the edsgc is limited to the 60 schmidt plates around the south galactic pole .",
    "both catalogues are complete to @xmath16 , i.e. about 5 magnitudes deeper than the zwicky catalogue ( whose photometric band is not too dissimilar to the @xmath17 ) , and still represent excellent and not yet exploited databases for fairly deep , wide  area redshift surveys .    not only are 2d galaxy catalogues fully important as source lists for redshift surveys , but they also bear significant statistical information on large  scale structure studies _ per se_. one important example of the results obtained directly from the two digitised catalogues discussed above is the angular correlation function @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these measures were largely responsible for killing the once fashionable standard cdm model ( where by  standard one meant @xmath19 , @xmath20 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , and a bias parameter @xmath21 @xcite",
    " see   [ sec : bias ] for definitions  ) .",
    "first redshift surveys based on the two catalogues started relatively early , in particular _",
    "sparsely sampled _ surveys , which represented a compromise between the wish to exploit the large areas available and the amount of telescope time needed to cover them spectroscopically .",
    "this is the case of the stromlo  apm survey and the durham - ukst survey , from which scientific results have been produced until very recently .",
    "the stromlo  apm survey includes 1797 redshifts , for galaxies selected  one out of every twenty  over the whole apm catalogue down to @xmath22 , observed using traditional single ",
    "slit spectroscopy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the durham ",
    "ukst survey instead , measured redshifts for @xmath23 galaxies , selecting one in three objects with magnitude brighter than @xmath24 from the smaller area of the edsgc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this survey was constructed using flair at the uk schmidt telescope , which is a fibre optic system capable of collecting the light of @xmath25 galaxies over the area of a schmidt plate and bringing it into the slit of a conventional spectrograph standing on the dome floor @xcite .",
    "indeed , one very specific aspect that made these 2d catalogues particularly attractive for redshift surveys , was the parallel development of fibre ",
    "optic spectrographs , capable of observing several tens of galaxy spectra over typical areas of half a degree in diameter .",
    "the first successful examples of these instruments were mounted at the cassegrain focus of 4  m class telescopes : following the pioneering work of the eighties ( see @xcite for a review ) , relevant examples at the time were focap and then autofib at the anglo ",
    "australian telescope , and optopus at the eso 3.6  m telescope @xcite .",
    "the density of fibres on the sky provided by these instruments corresponded to around 100 - 200 deg@xmath26 .",
    "these figures are matched by the average number counts of galaxies on the sky for blue limiting magnitudes @xmath27 , i.e. well within the limits of the edsgc and apm catalogues .",
    "this reasoning was at the origin of the eso slice project ( esp ) redshift survey , which used the eso optopus fibre coupler to observe all objects in the edsgc down to @xmath28 within a thin strip of @xmath29 , constructing an 85% redshift ",
    "complete sample of 3348 galaxies .",
    "the step forward in depth was gigantic , with respect to the zwicky  based surveys , nearly 4 magnitudes , which lead to an effective survey depth , i.e. the characteristic magnitude in the schechter form @xcite for the luminosity function , is detected within the survey . ] corresponding to a luminosity distance of @xmath30 .",
    "a pictorial view of the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the esp is shown in the cone diagram of figure  [ esp - cone ] . the survey and the main results obtained from its analyses",
    "have been largely discussed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "i shall summarise the main results obtained on galaxy clustering in the esp survey in  [ sec : stat ] .",
    "also based on intensive use of a multi  object fibre spectrograph , is the largest redshift survey completed to date , i.e. the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs @xcite ) , which represents the best existing compromise between depth and angular aperture .",
    "this redshift catalogue is slightly less deep than the esp ( @xmath31 , roughly corresponding to @xmath32 for a typical mean galaxy colour ) , but covers six slices of @xmath33 , for a total of @xmath34 redshifts . unlike most of the aforementioned surveys , the photometric parent sample for the lcrs was constructed anew from a specifically performed ccd drift  scan survey in the @xmath35 band .",
    "one peculiarity of the lcrs is that the selection of the target galaxies was subject not only to a cut in apparent magnitude , but also to a selection in surface brightness within the aperture of the used fibres .",
    "it is now clear ( dalcanton , private comm . ) , that this selection favours bulge  dominated galaxies , preferentially excluding the irregular galaxies that represent the main population at faint luminosities .",
    "this has a clear effect on the galaxy luminosity function as measured from the lcrs , showing up in an abnormally flat faint end @xcite , ( see @xcite for comparison to other surveys ) .",
    "on the other hand , the global clustering properties do not seem to be significantly affected by this selection , as judged from the comparison of its two  point correlation function with those of the esp and stromlo  apm surveys ( @xcite , see also figure  [ xi - surveys ] hereafter ) .",
    "the double cone diagram showing the large  scale distribution of galaxies in the six lcrs slices is reproduced in figure  [ lcrs_cones ] .",
    "the advantages of multi  object fibre spectroscopy have been pushed to the extreme with the construction of the 2degree  field ( 2df ) spectrograph for the prime focus of the anglo ",
    "australian telescope @xcite .",
    "this instrument is able to accommodate 400 automatically positioned fibres over a 2degree  diameter field .",
    "this implies a density of fibres on the sky of @xmath36 deg@xmath26 , and an optimal match to the galaxy counts for a magnitude similar to that of the esp survey , @xmath37 .",
    "the striking difference is that with such an area yield , a number of redshifts as in the esp survey ( although not distributed over a strip ) can be collected in @xmath38 exposures , i.e. slightly more than one night of telescope time with typical 1 hour exposures !",
    "it was rather natural , therefore , that a large redshift survey based on the 2df spectrograph were proposed by a uk - australian team .",
    "this survey is now known as the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and is based on the apm catalogue , giving us one further example of how importance of such large photometric catalogues .",
    "its goal is to measure redshifts for more than 250,000 galaxies with @xmath39 .",
    "about 4/5 of these lay within two large areas , @xmath40 and @xmath41 within the south and north galactic caps respectively , which are being fully covered with a honeycomb of 2df fields .",
    "another 40000 redshifts will be measured within 100 fields randomly distributed over the apm area , with the goal of maximising the signal in the power spectrum estimate on very large scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , a faint redshift survey of 10,000 galaxies brighter than @xmath42 will be performed over selected fields within the two main strips .",
    "the survey is steadily collecting redshifts , and first results on the luminosity function for different morphological types ( defined through their spectral properties ) , have been recently presented @xcite . from the cone diagram of figure  [ 2df - cone ] , we can have a visual impression of the status of the survey as of march 1999 , with a total of 41585 redshifts measured , ( note that the thickness of the slice is not uniform over the ra range ) . with the eye trained by the esp and lcrs diagrams",
    ", one can easily see the structures taking shape across the survey beams .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "see also the 2df web page at http://msowww.anu.edu.au/@xmath3colless/2df/ , where the diagram of figure  [ 2df - cone ] is continuously updated .",
    "the most ambitious and comprehensive galaxy survey project currently in progress is without any doubt the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this massive effort is carried on by an american consortium with the participation of japan .",
    "aim of the project is first of all to observe photometrically the whole northern galactic cap , @xmath43 away from the galactic plane ( @xmath44 deg@xmath45 ) in five bands , at limiting magnitudes , respectively of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the expectations are to detect @xmath51 galaxies and @xmath52 star  like sources among which a subset of @xmath53 agn candidates can be selected by colour techniques .",
    "this has already led , based on the first few hundred deg@xmath45 covered since first light ( may 1998 ) , to the discovery of several high  redshift ( @xmath54 ) quasars , including the highest  redshift quasar known , at @xmath55 @xcite . using two fibre spectrographs carrying 320 fibres each",
    ", the spectroscopic part of the survey will then collect spectra for about @xmath53 galaxies with @xmath56 and @xmath57 agn s with @xmath58 .",
    "the spectrographs are still being commissioned at the telescope at the time of writing this paper ( spring 1999 ) .",
    "the capability to isolate photometrically sub  classes of objects through their colours will be exploited also by selecting a sample of about @xmath57 `` red '' luminous galaxies with @xmath59 .",
    "these will be observed spectroscopically providing a nearly volume - limited sample of early  type galaxies with a median redshift @xmath60 , that will be extremely valuable to study the evolution of clustering . in figure",
    "[ sdss - pk ] , using a numerical simulation , the expected power spectrum of the whole sdss spectroscopic galaxy survey ( bottom line ) is compared to that corresponding to the subsample of red luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "note the gain in the clustering signal around the turnover in the power spectrum . ] .",
    "it is clear from this short description how the goals of the sdss are well beyond the pure realisation of a redshift survey for just studying large  scale structure . indeed , in addition to the immediate scientific results that will be produced by the survey team",
    ", it will build an unparalleled photometric and spectroscopic data base whose impact on the scientific community will last for several years .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite , with a more recent update as of fall 1998 , in @xcite .",
    "see also the sdss web site at http://www.sdss.org/ , where the latest news on the ongoing survey can be found .",
    "a general impression one could draw from the cone diagrams of the esp and lcrs surveys , and which is also taking shape within the 2df preliminary plot , is that inhomogeneities in the distribution of galaxies are limited to scales of @xmath61 , which are fairly well covered by these modern surveys . using bob kirshner words , we seem to be finally seeing `` the end of greatness '' , that is , we are finally sampling ( at least in two dimensions ) sizes which contain the relevant clustering scales of our universe .",
    "this was not the case until a few years ago , when any new survey used to discover larger and larger structures .",
    "a clear example of this situation is provided by the combined cfa2ssrs2 sample that we have shown in figure  [ cfa - ssrs ] .",
    "here the largest superclusters have sizes @xmath62 , comparable to the survey depth , and spanning its volume from one side to the other .",
    "it was because of evidences like these , together with the power ",
    "law behaviour shown by galaxy clustering ( see  [ sec : xi ] ) , that some researchers suggested that the large  scale galaxy distribution of galaxies could be described as a `` fractal dust '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fractal behaviour , if extrapolated to indefinite scales , i.e. if not up  bounded by a transition to a homogeneous distribution , has some rather dramatic consequences on our statistical description of large  scale structure @xcite .",
    "no mean density can be defined , and as a consequence the whole concept of _ density fluctuations _",
    "( with respect to a mean density ) becomes nonsensical .",
    "a quite intense debate has developed in the last few years about whether the available surveys really provide evidence for homogeneity on the largest scales explored , with  as it often happens  a tendency of the opposing views to crystallize on polarized positions . as an attempt to clarify a bit the situation by addressing this very basic question in a possibly objective way , in @xcite i reviewed some of the best available redshift survey data from this point of view .",
    "the application of some simple counting statistics as a function of the distance @xmath63 from the observer for a volume  limited sample extracted from a given survey .",
    "] , corroborated also by other more detailed analyses @xcite , seemed to show a general convergence to a homogeneous distribution , rather than supporting a fractal behaviour to the largest explorable scales . at the same time , however , it was clear ( as previously remarked @xcite ) , that the clustering of galaxies on small and intermediate scales could be described by power ",
    "law ranges consistent with a fractal , scale  free distribution .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached more recently by martinez @xcite .",
    "once we are convinced that indeed a transition to homogeneity does exist on some large scale around @xmath64 so that we can define a mean density of the universe in a sensible way , we can quantify the distribution of objects and matter in terms of _ density fluctuations_. given a mean density @xmath65 , and a spherical volume of radius @xmath63 , we can measure the fluctuation @xmath66 in the number of objects within such spheres , and compute the _ variance _ @xmath67 of this quantity . we shall then find that for typical optically  selected samples this is a decreasing function of @xmath63 ( galaxies are indeed clustered ! ) , with @xmath68 for @xmath69 , depending slightly on the mean luminosity of the objects considered . in particular , modern redshift surveys , with typical sizes exceeding a few @xmath70 , are probing volumes of the universe over which @xmath71 is significantly smaller than unity .",
    "unless mass is more clustered than light , that light is either clustered as mass or to some degree more clustered .",
    "however , one could in principle also conceive scenarios in which galaxy formation is suppressed by some physical mechanism in high  density regions , so that galaxies would look more homogeneously distributed than the real mass density field . ] , this should be reflected by a similar or even smaller variance @xmath72 in the mass density fluctuation field @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath74 , linear perturbation theory can be applied and comparison of models to observations becomes easier .",
    "in fact , if clustering is driven by gravitational instability , the amplitude of perturbations in the linear regime grows with time in a way which is independent of the spatial wavelength of the perturbation itself ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the evolution of any statistics describing the _ distribution _ of amplitudes at different wavelengths , as is the case for the power spectrum , and to some extent also of its fourier transform the two  point correlation function , will be described by a simple growth in amplitude , without any change in the shape .",
    "this means in practice that if we are able to measure accurately the present shape of @xmath75 or on scales where this behaviour still holds , we have a direct probe of the initial distribution of fluctuations , which can be directly compared to the linear power spectra predicted by the different models .",
    "this is one of the main motivations for extending redshift surveys to larger and larger volumes of the universe .      in the previous paragraph , we have quickly touched on the possibility that the variances we observe in the distribution of light and mass are not strictly the same . in fact , as we discussed , whatever redshift survey we are performing , we are not mapping the distribution of mass in the universe , but rather the distribution of objects that can be `` seen '' in some band of the electromagnetic spectrum and that serve as possible _",
    "tracers _ of matter distribution .",
    "we have seen , for example , that the lcrs and esp are selected in different photometric bands , red and blue respectively , with a further important cut in surface brightness for the lcrs , and how these differences affect measured properties as the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "while the lcrs and esp galaxies do not show significant variations in the global clustering properties ( i.e. , they apparently trace the density field in similar ways ) , more serious differences are found for example between optically  selected and infrared  selected samples , as notably shown by the large surveys based on the iras satellite infrared survey . a selection based on the iras infrared flux favours star - forming galaxies and avoids rich clusters .",
    "consequently , the iras density field is smoother than that generally seen by optically  selected galaxies , with a smaller correlation length ( @xmath76 vs. @xmath77 ) .",
    "does this mean that iras galaxies trace the mass density field , i.e. , that they are _ unbiased _ objects ?",
    "the only way to answer this question is to compare the galaxy distribution to the mass distribution derived independently from dynamical observations of the peculiar velocity field ( see e.g. @xcite ) and for the case of iras galaxies , the answer is probably yes .    to further clarify what we mean by _ biased _ tracers ,",
    "let us have a look at the distribution of different morphological types .",
    "it is well known that different galaxy types find themselves preferentially within different density regimes : elliptical and s0 s favour high  density regions , while spirals are much more common in low  density environments .",
    "this is the so  called _ morphology  density relation _ ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it inevitably affects the way in which different types trace the underlying mass density field . in figure  [ pp_xi_types ]",
    "i have included an estimate of the real  space two  point correlation function for early and late  type galaxies , obtained from the projected function @xcite .",
    "the plot shows how the morphology  density relation translates into a stronger clustering for elliptical galaxies .",
    "so , if we were for some reason able to detect only elliptical galaxies and assumed that they trace the mass , we would at first glance conclude that matter in the universe is on the average more clustered than it really is .",
    "all these examples pertain to the grand challenge of understanding how radiation emitted by cosmic objects ( at any wavelength ) is related to mass , i.e. the so  called _ bias _ , and even more importantly how this relation evolves with cosmic time .",
    "one way to define this is to write that @xmath78 where the linear bias @xmath79 is in general a function of scale @xmath63 and time @xmath80 .",
    "a proper comprehension of the behaviour of @xmath81 is becoming crucial now that observational data on clustering at very different cosmic epochs are being accumulated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , considerable energy has been spent in the last couple of years in developing physically motivated bias models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "with mean separations @xmath82 , clusters of galaxies are ideal objects for sampling efficiently long  wavelength fluctuations over large volumes of the universe .",
    "furthermore , fluctuations in the cluster distribution are amplified with respect to those in galaxies , i.e. they are _ biased _ in much the same way as we were discussing previously some classes of galaxies are : rich clusters form at the peaks of the large  scale density field , and their variance is amplified by a factor that depends on their mass , as it was first shown by kaiser @xcite . in the next section we shall see explicitly this effect at work in recent analyses of the clustering of clusters .    a thorough review of the use of clusters as tracers of large  scale structure has been given recently by postman @xcite , with particular attention paid to optically  selected clusters .",
    "for this reason , i will not discuss here the important issue of selecting clusters of galaxies in the optical band , i.e. from the 2d distribution of galaxies on the sky , but i will concentrate on results from x - ray selected cluster samples .",
    "reference to optically  selected samples will be limited to a discussion of the clustering results obtained from them .",
    "studies of x - ray selected clusters date back to the beginning of x - ray astronomy @xcite .",
    "however , only in recent years statistical studies became feasible , although still limited to the study of the temperature and luminosity functions , in particular through the data from the einstein medium sensitivity survey @xcite ) .",
    "the rosat satellite , launched in 1990 , not only produced serendipitous samples of distant clusters to update these studies ( see @xcite for a review ) , but carried out the first all  sky survey ever with an x - ray imaging telescope .",
    "this has represented a tremendous input for studies of large  scale structure using clusters of galaxies , as i shall describe in this section .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) was performed in the energy band between 0.1 and 2.4 kev with the pspc , a photon counter with a @xmath83 arcsec resolution on axis , degrading to nearly 2 arcmin at the edges of the 2degree field of view @xcite .",
    "the median exposure time in the rass was of @xmath84 s , which translates in an effective detection limit for clusters of @xmath85 erg s@xmath7 cm@xmath26 . considering that in the rosat hard band ( 0.52.0 kev ) , @xmath87 h@xmath26 erg s@xmath7 @xcite , this detection limit translates into a typical depth of @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 . the rass , therefore , provides a unique opportunity to detect clusters of galaxies within a huge volume of the `` local '' universe .",
    "in fact , follow  up work to construct x - ray cluster samples from the rass and measure their redshifts started early after completion of the survey ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a first example was a survey in the sgp area , that constructed a sample of about 200 clusters with the main aim of measuring the cluster ",
    "cluster correlation function @xcite . only recently",
    ", however , the all  sky coverage of the rass was properly exploited .",
    "this has been the aim of the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray ( reflex ) cluster survey , that uses clusters of galaxies to explore , in the southern hemisphere , a volume of the universe comparable to that of the sdss .",
    "the reflex cluster survey combines the x - ray data from the rass and optical follow  up observations using the eso telescopes , to construct a complete sample of about 700 clusters with measured redshift , to a flux limit @xmath90 erg s@xmath7 cm@xmath26 in the rosat band ( 0.12.4 kev ) .",
    "the survey covers essentially the southern celestial hemisphere ( @xmath91 ) , at galactic latitudes @xmath92 , to avoid regions of high absorption and crowding by stars .    during the development of the survey , this project already produced a first bright sample of 135 clusters ( the rass1 bright sample @xcite ) , limited to the sgp area , that served as a pilot work to fine  tune the strategy . at the time of writing ( spring 1999 ) , the first reflex sample of nearly 460 objects with @xmath93 erg s@xmath7 cm@xmath26 is on the verge of completion .",
    "this first sample , upon which the results on clustering and large - scale structure presented in the next sections are based , has been constructed to be at least 90% complete @xcite .",

    "in fact , this statement _ could not _ rigorously be true if a simple statistical amplification mechanism , as then suggested by kaiser @xcite , were the origin of the different amplitude : clusters trace scales @xmath82 , i.e. cover mostly fluctuations that are in the quasi  linear or linear regime , and it would have been a rather strange conspiracy , that their slope were the same that galaxies display on scales between 0.1 and @xmath77 , where clustering is highly nonlinear .",

    "[ sec : reflex ] i argued that x - ray selection is the best way to select homogeneous samples of clusters with well  defined physical criteria out to large redshifts .",

    "ray luminosity , for which also model predictions can be quite specific @xcite .",
    "this will also be an important output of the reflex survey @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform of the correlation function is the power spectrum p(k ) @xmath129 which describes the distribution of power among different wavevectors or",
    "once we decompose the fluctuation field @xmath131 over the fourier basis @xcite .",
    "the amount of information contained in @xmath75 is thus formally the same yielded by the correlation function .",
    "the estimates of @xmath75 or from redshift surveys , however , are affected in different ways by uncertainties introduced , for example , by the poor knowledge of the mean density ( in which case the power spectrum is to be preferred ) , or by the shape of the survey volume ( whose effect is usually more easily treated when computing rather than ) .",
    "useful references for learning more about this topic are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where further directions can be found to specific technical papers .",
    "one practical benefit of the description of clustering in fourier space through  is that for fluctuations of very long spatial wavelength ( @xmath132 ) , where is dangerously close to zero and errors easily make the measured values fluctuate around it , @xmath75 is on the contrary very large . around these scales ,",
    "most models predict the power spectrum to have a maximum , which reflects the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter  radiation equivalence .",
    "indeed , comparison of observations to the theory is in principle easier and more direct using .",
    "first , models are usually specified in terms of a linear , which is the result of the action of the specific _ transfer function _ of the model on a _ primordial spectrum _ , usually assumed to be of the so  called harrison  zeldovic scale  invariant form @xmath133 , which is also the kind of spectrum most naturally produced in inflationary scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in addition , k  modes in fourier space are statistically independent ( a part from the convolution effects due to the _ window function _ of the survey , see below ) , and direct @xmath134 comparisons to models is feasible , which is in principle not the case when the correlation function is analysed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    however , not everything is better with power spectra .",
    "redshift surveys are all but cubes ( i.e. what would be optimal for a fourier plane  wave decomposition ) , and their geometrical shape affects the measured power , so that what we really measure is the quantity @xmath135 the measured power spectrum is therefore a _ convolution _ of the true @xmath136 with the square modulus of the _ window function _ @xmath137 , that is the fourier transform of the survey volume , plus an additional shot  noise term . while the shot ",
    "noise contribution @xmath138 is easily corrected for , the recovery of the true   necessarily involves a delicate de ",
    "convolution operation in @xmath139 space .",
    "while for nearly tridimensional surveys ( as iras - based surveys @xcite , or the cfa2ssrs2 @xcite , stromlo  apm @xcite , durham ",
    "ukst @xcite , and reflex surveys ) , the effect of the window function is mostly negligible , for nearly two  dimensional surveys as the lcrs or , even worse , the esp , its effect is dramatic to very small wavelengths .",
    "the key point is that for slice surveys like esp , the window function is very anisotropic , in particular it is extremely large along the direction perpendicular to the main plane of the survey .",
    "when the final estimate of  is computed by averaging over the whole @xmath140 solid angle , this anisotropy brings contributions from different @xmath141 s into the same averaged @xmath139 bin .",
    "it is important to keep these limitations in mind when one compares estimates of  from different surveys as we shall do here .",
    "a comprehensive discussion on different estimators for  and how to take these effects into account can be found in @xcite .",
    "a different approach for dealing with surveys with peculiar shapes is otherwise that suggested by vogeley & szalay @xcite , using the so  called karhunen ",
    "love transform . rather than trying to correct the effect of the window function over the plane waves of the fourier basis , the idea is to find a different set of orthonormal eigenvectors which are optimal given the survey geometry .",
    "the interesting quantities , as e.g. , are then projected on this basis , both for the data and for the models , and comparison is performed through a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "application of this method has been so far limited only to the 2d case @xcite . a first application to the reflex data",
    "@xcite is yielding promising results .      in figure  [ pk_gal ] , i have plotted the estimates of  for the same surveys as given in figure  [ xi - surveys ] .",
    "the four data sets allow me also to make a comparison of estimates from relatively tridimensional surveys ( stromlo  apm , durham - ukst ) , to more bidimensional samples as the lcrs and esp , the latter being in practice a single thin slice cut through the galaxy distribution .",
    "this means that the effect of the window function ( and the need of a proper correction ) on these data sets is very different .",
    "in addition , three of the four samples are selected in exactly the same photometric band , the blue  green @xmath17 ( two , esp and durham  ukst are even constructed from the same catalogue , the edsgc ) , the only exception being the @xmath35-band selected lcrs .",
    "this has the positive effect of reducing the relative biasing between the different samples , although some effect is possibly still present due to the different luminosity ranges covered .    in the same figure ,",
    "i have also plotted ( dashed line )  as reconstructed from the projected angular clustering of the apm galaxy catalogue @xcite .",
    "this is clearly the only estimate which is free of redshift  space distortions .",
    "the effect of these is shown in particular by the slope above @xmath142 : an increased slope in real space ( dashed line ) corresponds to a stronger damping by peculiar velocities , diluting the apparent clustering observed in redshift space ( all points ) .",
    "the first impression from this comparison is that to first order there is quite a good agreement across the different samples .",
    "the general trend is that of a well  defined power law range between @xmath143 and @xmath144 , with a slope around @xmath145 .",
    "note that despite these samples are rather similar in terms of their galaxy properties , a minimal level of relative biasing might be present because of the relative weight of faint and bright objects .",
    "the only two samples that should in principle display the same amplitude are the esp and the durham  ukst surveys , which are both selected from the edsgc catalogue .",
    "in fact , their  are practically identical over a good range of @xmath139 s . on one hand , the durham ",
    "ukst  becomes rather noisy at small scales , due to the sparse sampling strategy of this survey ( less sparse than the stromlo ",
    "apm , though ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the esp  performs well on small scales , but on large scales it has to be limited to @xmath146 , below which the effect of its nasty window function can not be deconvolved appropriately .",
    "in fact , the very good agreement with the durham  ukst down to fairly small @xmath139 s is a very encouraging indication of the quality of the deconvolution procedure performed by the authors@xcite .",
    "we also note how the lcrs power spectrum tends to be flatter and of lower amplitude around the tentative turnover displayed by the durham  ukst and stromlo  apm spectra . also at large @xmath139 s , where esp and durham  ukst are significantly damped by small  scale pairwise velocities",
    ", the lcrs  seems to be less affected by this distortion .",
    "the same trend is also visible in the correlation function plot of figure  [ xi - surveys ] .    recalling the discussion of   [ sec : xi ] on the shoulder observed in the two  point correlation function above @xmath147 , here we can see clearly the same effect in  by looking at the real  space power spectrum from the apm catalogue .",
    "the slope of the apm  above @xmath148 is @xmath149 , corresponding to the small  scale clustering regime ( in real space ! ) where @xmath99 . below this scale ,",
    "steepens to @xmath150 , and this is what produces the excess power in on large scales .",
    "peacock @xcite applied the sophisticated linear reconstruction machinery by hamilton and collaborators @xcite to the whole   from the apm catalogue ( and to another real  space estimate from the the iras - qdot survey @xcite ) and concluded that the shape was indeed consistent with a linear power spectrum characterised by a steep slope ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "this is the same value of linear slope originally suggested in @xcite to explain the observed large",
    " scales shape of in the cfa1 and perseus ",
    "pisces redshift surveys , and confirms the early speculation that the observed change in slope of is a manifestation of the transition from the quasi  linear to the strongly nonlinear clustering regime .      also for measuring the power spectrum ,",
    "clusters of galaxies offer the most efficient alternative to galaxies , given their ability to sample very large volumes . a first preliminary estimate of @xmath75 from the reflex survey is shown in figure  [ pk_clusters ] @xcite , compared to the power spectra of the largest redshift sample available for abell clusters @xcite , and that of the apm automatic optically  selected clusters @xcite .",

    "the analysis of the whole survey should also allow to put more serious constraints on the detailed shape of @xmath75 around the turnover .      during the last few years",
    ", evidence has indeed been accumulating that the peak of the power spectrum could be rather sharp , perhaps characterised by an extra feature ( with respect to smooth traditional models ) around its maximum .",
    "einasto and collaborators @xcite analysed the distribution of abell clusters , finding evidence for a sharp peak around @xmath157 .",
    "although their result was questioned by other workers because of the possible incompleteness in the sample and the way @xmath75 was estimated , the presence of such a feature was confirmed by a more conservative reanalysis of abell data @xcite , where a slightly less pronounced but still significant peak is found , as we show in figure  [ pk_clusters ] .",
    "the peak is indeed evident in the abell data , while the preliminary reflex sample is not yet able to put serious constraints on the shape around the turnover .",
    "note also the very good agreement of the slopes of the three power spectra above @xmath158 , and at the same time the shift in amplitude of the three samples .",
    "the latter is a clear manifestation , again , of the different bias of the three samples .",
    "an x - ray selected sample as reflex allows for a more direct link to the typical mass of the objects we are looking at ( see @xcite , for a more extended discussion of these points ) .    if we also recall that evidence for excess power around @xmath159 was provided by a 2d power spectrum analysis of the lcrs slices @xcite , we can not avoid being amused by the consistency in the peak scale to which these separate measures point , i.e. , consistently between 100 and @xmath160 .",
    "this is remarkably close to the `` periodicity '' scale revealed by broadhurst and collaborators ( @xcite , beks hereafter ) , in the analysis of their 1dimensional pencil  beam surveys towards the galactic poles .",
    "this latter result has certainly been one of the most exciting findings of this decade in the study of large  scale structure .",
    "the authors merged together two deep redshift surveys of redshifts performed independently in the direction the two galactic poles over a small field of @xmath161 degrees , exploring a total 1dimensional baseline of @xmath162 .",
    "the resulting galaxy distribution showed a surprising regularity of `` spikes '' .",
    "the visual impression was quantified and confirmed by a 1d correlation and power spectrum analysis , that clearly indicated a preferential `` fluctuation '' at @xmath163 .",
    "this result originated significant controversy .",
    "it was suggested that it could just be an aliasing of power due to the small size of the beam , that projected power from small to large scales @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the reality of the effect was supported by independent observations showing how the more nearby peaks detected in the pencil beam were coincident with known , real large  scale structures , as the great wall or the sculptor supercluster ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further pencil beams in different directions ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a denser sampling around the original pointings @xcite also show that , yes , this direction is somewhat special , but only in the sense that here the effect is maximised .",
    "this is what one would statistically expect if there is indeed a distribution of typical `` cell '' sizes around a characteristic dimension @xcite .",
    "the peak observed in the 3d power spectrum of abell clusters around the same scale is further suggesting that the origin of the beks periodicity lies indeed in a specific feature in the 3d power distribution around this wavelength .",
    "note also in figures  [ xi - surveys ] , [ xi - abell ] and  [ xi - esp - reflex ] the behaviour of the two  point correlation functions on very large scales , for both galaxies and clusters .",
    "although the binning of is very coarse at these separations , there is a hint that becomes positive again around @xmath164 .",
    "this seems to be common to nearly all surveys , independently of their geometry ( slice or 3d surveys ) , the kind of tracer ( galaxy or clusters ) , and the estimator used . as can be readily seen by fourier transforming a `` standard '' @xmath75 ( e.g. , a cdm shape @xcite ) , this damped oscillation of can not be reproduced if  has a smooth turnover around its maximum , and seems to be a further hint for a sharp peak .",
    "a similar oscillation in the correlation function was claimed for abell clusters @xcite , and interpreted as evidence for a sharp feature in @xmath75 .    at the time of writing this review ( spring 99 ) , one very interesting piece of evidence has been provided along the same lines by broadhurst and jaffe @xcite , who analyse the redshift distribution of the high  redshift samples of lyman  break selected galaxies by steidel and collaborators @xcite . as shown in figure  [ ly - peaks ] , they find again the same effect detected at smaller redshift , i.e. the emergence of a preferred clustering scale .",
    "one important consequence is that the co  moving scale of the peak in the power spectrum measured locally ( @xmath165 ) , can be used as a standard stick to provide a constrain on the combination of @xmath166 and @xmath167 : @xmath168 , which for a flat universe ( @xmath169 ) , gives @xmath170 .",
    "the convergence of so many independent observations seems to have left little doubt , in my opinion , that the observed characteristic scale is real , and is telling us something important about the properties of our universe .",
    "indeed , on the theory side there has been considerable interest in the recent literature about the possibile relation of this peak to baryonic acoustic features produced within the last scattering surface at @xmath171 , when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation originated .",
    "eisenstein and collaborators @xcite , show however how a large baryon fraction ( @xmath172 or larger ) , and a rather _ ad hoc _ combination of parameters ( as e.g. a  blue \" tilt of the primordial spectrum ) are required to match the observed abell peak , while at the same time being consistent with the cluster abundance .",
    "more dramatically , it is worrying to see that no realistic cdm parameter combination is capable to account for the excess power ( the  shoulder \" ) we were discussing in section  [ sec : xi ] , that is displayed by virtually all modern surveys @xcite .    even without considering the existence of extreme features",
    ", therefore there seems to be a general difficulty for the `` standard '' theory to explain the detailed shape of @xmath75 , now that the data are becoming of higher and higher quality in the linear regime .",
    "especially when one tries matching the power spectrum implied by the growing amount of cmb anisotropy experiments to that displayed by the clustering of luminous matter , problems seem to be unavoidable . according , for example , to silk & gawiser",
    "@xcite  if the data are accepted as being mostly free of systematics and _ ad hoc _ additions to the primordial power spectrum are avoided , there is no acceptable model for large - scale structure . \"",
    "once again , a major uncertainty prevents any firm statement from being made : are we allowed to compare the power spectrum derived from the distribution of light to that derved from the mass ( cmb ) , through a simple linear bias scaling ?",
    "clearly , a scale  dependent bias would add room for any detailed match between models and the data , but without a solid physical basis would also add an unpleasant _ ad hoc _ taste to the whole picture .",
    "in addition , the extremely linear relation between the correlation functions of galaxies and clusters that we have shown in figure  [ xi - esp - reflex ] , seems to suggest that at least above @xmath173 the galaxy and mass distributions are linked by a simple linear bias .",
    "figure  [ aitoff_surveys ] gives a pictorial view of the sky coverage by wide  angle redshift surveys of galaxies and clusters that have mapped or are in the course of mapping the `` local '' universe to @xmath154 .",
    "all these surveys have been discussed in some detail in the previous sections .",
    "while considerable effort will still be necessary to complete the coverage both in photometry and redshift of this volume of the universe , massive redshift surveys are already being planned to study large  scale structure at redshifts of the order of unity .",
    "deep redshift surveys , as demonstrated by the results from the clustering of lyman  break galaxies discussed in the previous section , give in principle the possibility to trace the growth of structure , which represents a formidable test for theories : a successful model must be able not only to reproduce the final picture , but also all the snapshots of the `` cosmic movie '' at different epochs .    however , when we start exploring a baseline in time comparable to galaxy evolutionary times , we not only have the problem of understanding how our galaxy tracers map the underlying mass density field , but also to know the way they evolve , i.e. we need a full comprehension of the bias function @xmath174 .",
    "a successful theory must therefore provide two different ingredients : 1 ) a cosmological background , i.e. a linear power spectrum , depending on h@xmath175 , @xmath176 and to the kind of dark  matter particles dominating the mass density , including a possible curvature contribution by a cosmological constant @xmath177 ; 2 ) a recipe to convert the mass and the growth history of `` objects '' ( i.e. dark matter halos ) , forming during the gravitational evolution from the chosen initial conditions , into radiation with some spectral distribution , to be `` observed '' and compared to the real data .",
    "this is the arena of semi  analytical galaxy formation models ( see the review by kauffmann , these proceedings ) . here",
    "halos obtained through analytical `` merging trees '' ( e.g. @xcite ) , or from purely gravitational n  body simulations @xcite are `` lite  up '' through as realistic as possible analytical recipes .",
    "this seems at present the best we can do to properly attach some `` flesh '' on the evolving `` bones '' of large  scale structure .",
    "it is self  evident that the inherent complication of realistically treating the dissipative part of this process ( e.g. cooling , star formation , stellar evolution , supernova feedback  just to mention a few of the branches into which the problem of galaxy formation needs to be decomposed to become tractable ) , represents the weakest aspect of this machinery , and makes the use of galaxies as tracers of the evolution of large  scale structure a rather tricky game .",
    "could we perhaps find a way to select some kind of tracer that does not evolve ( or at least such that its evolution is weak and simple to understand ) , out to some cosmologically significant redshift ?",
    "clearly , if we push this redshift limit to some indefinitely high value , this can not be true for any class of objects , as sooner or later we shall hit the epoch of their major formation .",
    "however , we could hope to isolate specific redshift ranges over which the growth of structure is significant , while the intrinsic mean spectrophotometric properties of such tracers remain the same .    to select such objects , detailed _ colour _ information , i.e. multi  band photometry ,",
    "is fundamental .",
    "this implies that future deep galaxy redshift surveys will necessary have to be based on photometric catalogues covering possibly from the @xmath178 band in the ultraviolet to the @xmath179 band in the infrared .",
    "this is the case for the virmos deep survey , that i shall briefly describe in  [ sec : virmos ] .",
    "the power of colour selection to isolate classes of objects within specific redshift ranges has been extraordinarily demonstrated by the lyman ",
    "break selection technique @xcite .",
    "these strategies , which base their power on the existence of `` breaks '' in the spectrum of galaxies , tend clearly to select galaxies for which these features are particularly prominent .",
    "the technique of steidel and collaborators selects preferentially galaxies at @xmath180 or @xmath181 ( depending whether @xmath178band or @xmath182band drop - outs are selected ) , with strong star formation , that enhances the lyman break at 912   .",
    "while lyman  break galaxies represent a class of objects whose properties would have changed significantly by the present time , it is possible to use similar techniques to select `` steady '' objects as early  type galaxies , for which another spectral break , that at 4000  is particularly prominent , within a well  defined redshift interval .",
    "for example , iovino and collaborators @xcite have been able , using schmidt plates in three bands , @xmath17 , @xmath63 , and @xmath183 , to construct a sample of several thousands early  type galaxies within the redshift range @xmath184 , and measure their clustering .",
    "they find a correlation length @xmath185 , to be confronted to the value of more than @xmath186 at the present epoch ( see figure  [ pp_xi_types ] ) .",
    "this is one of the cleanest measures of the evolution of large  scale structure presently available : through the selection of a slowly evolving class of objects we try to circumvent our ignorance about how galaxies in general form and evolve . in this way , the measured difference in the clustering strength should only reflect the growth of fluctuations , and therefore the cosmological model .",
    "we have seen already how the application of this technique to the unique multi  band photometric catalogue of sdss will create in a similar way a volume  limited sample of 100,000 early  type galaxies with measured redshift .",
    "the exploration to @xmath188 was pioneered at the beginning of the nineties by deep pencil beam surveys as beks , and the canada - france redshift survey @xcite . a summary of clustering results from deep surveys , together with the most recent advances related to the lyman ",
    "break selected galaxies can be found in @xcite . here",
    "i would like to spend a few words describing a large survey in an advanced stage of preparation , that promises to enlarge by two orders of magnitudes the number of available redshifts at @xmath189 : the virmos deep survey .",
    "this survey has its origin in the construction of two spectrographs for visible and ir light ( vimos and nirmos ) , for the ut3 and ut4 telescopes of the eso vlt , which is presently carried out by a consortium of french and italian institutes led by o. le fvre @xcite .",
    "120 nights of guaranteed time will be spent with these two instruments , starting in late 2000 , to perform a redshift survey of 150,000 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath190 .",
    "the broad goal of the virmos deep survey is a comprehensive study of the formation and evolution of galaxies , with particular emphasis on the evolution of the luminosity function , star - formation rate , clustering and the fundamental plane .",
    "to reach these goals , the following observations are planned :    * spectroscopy of more than 100,000 galaxies with magnitude @xmath191 observed at low resolution over four fields with a total area of @xmath192 deg@xmath45 .",
    "* spectroscopy of @xmath193 galaxies with magnitude @xmath194 observed at low resolution over an area of 1 - 2 deg@xmath45 .",
    "* spectroscopy of @xmath195 galaxies at higher resolution for study of the fundamental plane of galaxies * ultra - deep spectroscopy using an integral field unit ( ifu ) , ( that is , a pack of 6400 fibres over a @xmath196 arcmin@xmath45 field ) , of about 1000 galaxies to @xmath197 .",
    "the total numbers listed above will be made possible by the enormous multiplexing gain of the spectrographs : vimos in particular , will have the ability to collect simultaneously , in low resolution mode , nearly 800 spectra over a total field of @xmath198 arcmin@xmath45 .",
    "this field of view is split into four quadrants , to reduce the size of the optical elements required .",
    "figure  [ virmos - slits ] reproduces the simulated appearance of the image from one of the four ccd detectors , with nearly 200 spectra packed over the available area .",
    "the spectroscopic targets for the survey with vimos an nirmos are being selected from a ubvrik imaging campaign that is currently in progress using the cfht , eso - ntt , eso-2.2 m and ctio-4 m telescopes .",
    "given our still poor knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution , and on the contrary the relative simplicity of the physycs involved in the x - ray emission from clusters of galaxies , x - ray selected cluster have the potential to become one of the best tools for tracing large  scale structure at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen a number of studies on the evolution of the cluster abundance and of their x - ray luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these works have shown that the abundance of clusters with @xmath199 h@xmath26 erg s@xmath200 does not seem to evolve significantly between the present epoch and @xmath187 .",
    "although some uncertainties on how to relate this to the underlying evolution of the mass function still remain , these observations , together with the easiness in detecting x - ray clusters to high redshifts , qualifies them as excellent tracers for studying the evolution of large - scale structure .",
    "the kind of flux limits that it is necessary to reach , to be able to detect at @xmath187 objects with such luminosities , are comparable to the depth of rosat pointed observations , i.e. @xmath201 . however , to be able to map large - scale structure at high redshifts , we shall need a survey covering an area significantly larger than the @xmath202 deg@xmath45 typical of the serendipitous surveys constructed from the rosat pspc archive , and in particular much less sparse than these .",
    "such an x - ray survey has been recently proposed as the science drive for the construction of a wide - field x - ray satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "crucial for such a survey instrument is a novel design of the x - ray optics @xcite which are able to obtain stable point ",
    "spread function of @xmath38 arcsec over a 1-degree diameter field , in contrast to the rapidly degrading resolution of classical wolter  type telescopes @xcite . a prototype of such innovative mirrors has been already constructed and successfully tested in the merate labs of oab . a more detailed discussion of the use of x - ray clusters as tracers of the evolution of structure , as a scientific case for future wide  angle deep x - ray surveys will be found in @xcite .",
    "looking at the various topics addressed in this paper , we can probably imagine the future development of this field during the first 10 years of the new millennium as possibly moving along two directions .",
    "one one side , the completion of the 2df and in particular of the sloan digital sky survey will produce profound progress in the knowledge of many important statistical aspects of large  scale structure at @xmath203 .",
    "first of all , it is clear that something very interesting is hidden in the exact shape of the power spectrum near the expected turnover . while we seem finally to detect such turnover with some significance from the best samples now available , the data are still too poor on scales of @xmath204 to sample it with sufficient resolution in @xmath139 space .",
    "this feature is more clearly detected when high  threshold objects as clusters of galaxies or lyman  break galaxies are analysed .",
    "larger samples of clusters of galaxies will be therefore essential : the reflex survey will be pushed down in flux by about a factor of two within the next two years , which will bring the number of clusters in the sample up to @xmath205 , probing a volume extending to @xmath206 . at the same time , the sample of red luminous galaxies from the sdss seems to represent the most promising data set for exploring the scales around the peak of @xmath75 in sufficient detail .",
    "also , the question on whether these features in the distribution of objects are partly a product of biasing , and therefore can not be transferred to the matter power spectrum , will find an answer when detailed cmb anisotropy experiments will explore such scales .",
    "there seem to be all premises that the planck surveyor ( see e.g. efstathiou , these proceedings ) will be able to provide this information to a high level of accuracy .    at the same time , 10meter class telescopes equipped with a new generation of spectrographs give the opportunity to extend systematic studies of large samples of galaxies to redshifts above unity .",
    "i have briefly described the largest of these projects , the vlt  virmos deep survey .",
    "similar surveys with smaller sizes are being planned by different groups around the world , as newer instrumentation on very large telescopes commences operation .",
    "one example that i did not have time to discuss here is the deimos spectrograph , under construction for the keck ii telescope @xcite .",
    "the study of very large volumes of the universe at high redshifts , however , will have to resort to using tracers which can be both more efficient and easier to understand than galaxies .",
    "x - ray selected clusters of galaxies provide this opportunity .",
    "consequently , it would be highly significant if within the next @xmath207 years a large , possibly all  sky , survey in the x - ray band to a flux about 2 orders of magnitude fainter than the rosat all - sky survey ( @xmath208 erg s@xmath7 cm@xmath26 ) be performed .",
    "concrete proposals in this direction have recently been presented @xcite , and will hopefully become reality in the near future .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the 19@xmath5 texas symposium on relativistic astrophysics for inviting me to give this review talk .",
    "i thank all my collaborators in the large  scale structure projects i have described throughout this paper , particularly hans bhringer , guido chincarini , chris collins , olivier le fvre , peter schuecker , paolo vettolani and elena zucca .",
    "a special acknowledgment goes to stefano borgani for a number of enlightening discussions on the use of x - ray clusters as tracers of large  scale structure , for teaching me a lot about theoretical cosmology and for reading the manuscript .",
    "thanks are due also to fiona hoyle , helen tadros , matthew colless and huan lin for providing electronic versions of their results and to silvia quarello for useful discussions .",
    "i am also grateful to rychard bouwens for carefully reading an early version of the manuscript and providing useful comments .",
    "finally , special thanks should go to my wife and my kids , for their patience during the hours spent writing this review during weekends , and for alleviating the difficulty of finishing it , through their company and background playing .",
