    "the phenomenon of rotation plays a very important role in almost all classes of objects that encompass our physical universe . particularly in the discussion of inertia ,",
    "rotational features characterise global effects on local physics as implied by mach s principle .",
    "recently , prasanna @xcite has defined a new parameter called the _ cumulative drag index _ for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes , using the notion of inertial forces within the framework of general relativity .",
    "the index , defined for particles in circular orbit along the trajectory on which the centrifugal acceleration is zero , characterises the intrinsic feature of rotation through the drag induced on both co - rotating and counter - rotating particles .",
    "however , for practical applications , it would be useful to generalise the drag index to include the centrifugal acceleration also .",
    "a few years ago , astronomers discovered two co - spatial stellar disks in the galaxy ngc-4550 , one orbiting prograde and the other retrograde with respect to the galactic nucleus , in the core of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "bicak and ledvinka @xcite have tried to construct sources for the kerr geometry using counter - rotating thin disks .",
    "if one considers the galactic nucleus as a black hole , one can then use the kerr geometry for the outside and have counter - streaming jets outside the ergo - region .",
    "the presence of such co- and counter - rotating particle streams may perhaps be characterised through the drag index , defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , denote , respectively , the centrifugal , the coriolis and the gravitational accelerations acting on a particle in circular orbit in a stationary , axisymmetric gravitational field . within the framework of general relativity this definition is unique , when one considers the spacetime expressed in the conformal 3 + 1 splitting with the four acceleration @xmath4 being expressible covariantly as @xcite @xmath5 the various quantities on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : accl ] ) are as described below : @xmath6 is the vector field corresponding to the zero angular momentum observers expressed in terms of the killing vectors @xmath7 ( timelike ) and @xmath8 ( spacelike ) as @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the scalar potential @xmath11 @xmath12 is the unit spacelike vector orthogonal to @xmath6 along the circle depicting the orbit of the particle with a constant speed @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the lorentz factor . the particle four velocity , @xmath16 , is thus expressible as @xmath17 and is also equal to @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the redshift factor defined as @xmath20 @xmath21 being the angular velocity , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the vector defined on the conformally projected 3-space having the positive definite metric @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath26 .    as shown earlier , for the metric @xmath27 the accelerations",

    "taking now the specific example of kerr spacetime @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and considering a particle in circular orbit on the equatorial plane @xmath33 , it can be seen that the index is @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2am\\omega[r^4(r+2m)+2a^2r(r^2 + 4mr-10m^2)+a^4(r+6m)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\omega^2(r^3+a^2r+2ma^2)[r^4(r-4m)+a^2r(r^2 - 5mr+10m^2)-3a^4 m ] \\biggr\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\biggl/\\biggl\\{\\delta(r^3+a^2r+2a^2m)(-m(1-a\\omega)^2+\\omega^2r^3)\\biggr\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that , of the two infinities of the index , one appears at the event horizon @xmath35 while the other depends on both @xmath36 and @xmath21 and appears for a given @xmath36 and @xmath21 at @xmath37^{1/3}$ ] . fig .",
    "( [ fig : cdi - om ] ) shows the nature of @xmath38 at the three locations , @xmath39 ( the prograde photon orbit ) , @xmath40 ( the retrograde photon orbit ) and @xmath41 ( the orbit where the centrifugal force is zero ) .",
    "while at @xmath39 the index is positive only for a very small range of @xmath21 for counter - rotating particles @xmath42 , at @xmath40 the index is positive for the same range of @xmath21 for co - rotating particles only . on the other hand ,",
    "as was discussed earlier in @xcite , at @xmath41 the index is positive for both co- and counter - rotating particles , but again for a very narrow range of values of @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : cdi - om]c ) ) .",
    "this change of behaviour of @xmath43 at the two photon orbits arises due to the following reason : when the centrifugal force is not zero , the two zeros of the denominator of @xmath38 outside the event horizon corresponding to the fixed value of @xmath44 and @xmath36 , are at @xmath45 and corresponding to these two @xmath21 values the numerator of @xmath38 factors as @xmath46\\ ] ] and @xmath47\\,,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "thus the zero at @xmath48 cancels with the numerator at the prograde photon orbit , while the one at @xmath49 cancels with the numerator at the retrograde photon orbit .    for many applications ,",
    "often one takes the view that the linearized kerr metric might be sufficient to incorporate the relativistic effects , when the body is slowly rotating . in order to examine this ,",
    "let us consider the nature of @xmath38 under this approximation .",
    "the three accelerations acting on a particle in circular orbit , approximated to terms linear in the kerr parameter @xmath36 , are given by @xmath50 { \\cal f}_{\\rm co}&= &   -\\frac{6am\\omega } { ( r^2 - 2mr - \\omega^2    r^4)}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ [ 2em ] { \\cal f}_{\\rm cf}&= & \\frac{\\omega(r-3m)(\\omega^3r^6 - \\omega r^4 + 2 m \\omega r^3   + 4mar - 8am^2)}{r(r-2m)(r-2m-\\omega^2 r^3)^2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus the index is @xmath51\\biggl/\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\biggl[m(r-2m)-2am\\omega r-\\omega^2r^3(r - m)+6am\\omega^3r^3 + \\omega^4r^6\\biggr]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the very first change one notices is that , neglecting @xmath52 and higher order terms in @xmath36 , moves the infinity at the horizon to @xmath53 , as this would now represent the horizon , just like in the static case .",
    "similarly , the orbit where the centrifugal acceleration is zero also coincides with that in the static case , viz . , @xmath54 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "( [ fig : lcdi - om ] ) shows the index for the linearised version at the two photon orbits and at the orbit on which the centrifugal acceleration is zero .",
    "comparison of these plots with those for the unapproximated @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) clearly shows that for particles with angular velocity @xmath55 , the behaviour is exactly same with or without the approximation at the photon orbits whereas at the orbit with @xmath56 , the similarity is striking for all values of @xmath21 .    as it would be almost impossible for particles to have a low value of @xmath21 close to photon orbits ( as they would be relativistic )",
    ", the behaviour of the index shows that the linearisation approximation for the forces is amply justified for all practical purposes .",
    "however , as a matter of principle one finds that for very low values of @xmath21 the behaviour of the linearised version differs from that for the exact version , the difference arising mainly because of the centrifugal acceleration being non - zero .",
    "if one considers the behaviour of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath44 for fixed @xmath36 and @xmath21 , it seems to be exactly like for @xmath38 , the expression without approximation .",
    "looking at the overall feature of the inertial accelerations it then seems that for understanding the frame dragging coming from rotation , for practical purposes of considering the forces , it may indeed be sufficient to calculate the gravitational , coriolis and centrifugal acceleration in the linearised approximation , as given in eq .",
    "( [ lforces ] ) .",
    "it is further interesting to consider the newtonian limit of the accelerations with lowest order corrections in the centrifugal acceleration , as given by : @xmath58 with these expressions the drag index turns out to be @xmath59 fig .",
    "( [ fig : ncdi - om ] ) shows the plots of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath21 , for fixed @xmath44 and @xmath36 ( [ fig : ncdi - om]a , b ) and as a function of @xmath44 for fixed @xmath36 and @xmath21 ( [ fig : ncdi - om]c , d ) . as the newtonian approximation can be valid only for larger values of @xmath44",
    ", it is clear that the index is positive for both co- and counter - rotating particles for @xmath61 , independent of the values of @xmath36 .",
    "we shall next consider the behaviour of the index for the neugebauer - meinel metric @xcite for a rigidly rotating disk of dust as given in the discussion of its dragging effects by meinel and kleinwchter @xcite .",
    "the metric components and their first radial derivatives of significance are @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath64 represents the relative redshift of photons from the centre of the disk measured at infinity , @xmath65 is a parameter defined through the relation @xmath66 and @xmath67 represents the rim of the disk . using eqs .",
    "[ eq : cdigen ] , [ eq : fgr][eq : fcf ] and [ eq : diskmetric ] , the drag index may be obtained as : @xmath68\\biggl/\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\biggl [ \\mu(\\omega_d-\\omega ) ( 1+z ) \\{\\omega_d(1+z ) + \\omega(1-z)\\}\\{\\mu(1+z)^2 - 2z^2\\}\\biggr]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the angular velocity of the particle .",
    "it is clear from the above expression that the two zeros of the denominator , where the index blows up , correspond to the two _ circular geodesic orbits _",
    ", as the sum of the forces acting on the particle is zero for these parameters .",
    "while the zero at @xmath69 , corresponds to the prograde geodesic , the one at @xmath70 , corresponds to the retrograde geodesic as also shown by meinel and kleinwchter .",
    "however , one finds that if @xmath71 , the second zero occurs at a positive value of @xmath21 as shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om]d ) . fig .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om ] ) shows the plots of the index for four different values of @xmath65 .",
    "the presence of centrifugal acceleration does bring in a difference in the behaviour of the drag index at the two photon orbits , with the co - rotating ones having a positive value for a narrow range of @xmath21 at the retrograde photon orbit and the counter - rotating ones having a similar feature at the prograde photon orbit .",
    "however , if the black hole is slowly rotating ( @xmath72 , @xmath52 negligible ) , then adopting the linearised version of the acceleration changes the behaviour of the index only for very low values of @xmath21 ( @xmath73 ) at the photon orbits , whereas for higher values of @xmath21 the behaviour resembles that of the full @xmath38 without any approximation . on the other hand , for given @xmath36 and @xmath21 , as a function of @xmath44 the radial distance parameter",
    ", the index shows no change with approximation , thus indicating that the drag index signifies something intrinsic to the spacetime with rotation , as its behaviour for both co- and counter - rotating particles appears similar , from the point of view of a locally non - rotating observer .    in order to appreciate the significance of the index defined",
    ", one can consider its behaviour for the physical case of a rotating disk as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om ] ) . comparing with the discussions of meiner and kleinwchter",
    ", we find that the constraints on the value of @xmath64 appearing through the parameter @xmath65 , is well reflected in figs .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om]a , b , c ) . while fig .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om]a ) shows clearly the existence of two geodesic orbits ( pro and retro ) for @xmath74 , fig .",
    "( [ fig : dcdi - om]b ) shows for @xmath75 , the existence of only a prograde geodesic .",
    "in fact it is instructive to compare this with fig .",
    "( [ fig : cdi - om]b ) which corresponds to @xmath43 at the retrograde photon orbit for kerr , and thus conclude that @xmath75 corresponds indeed to the last possible retrograde geodesic orbit .",
    "further , from the zeros of the denominator of @xmath43 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : dcdi ] ) , the appearance of the retrograde geodesic corresponds to the particle angular velocity @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , for this value of @xmath21 the numerator of the index factors as @xmath77 which clearly shows that the zero of the denominator cancels with the term @xmath78 in the numerator for @xmath79 , exactly similar to what happens in the case of the kerr metric . it is obvious that for the case @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 , this value of @xmath21 becomes positive , the infinity of the index appearing for a prograde orbit .",
    "however , this orbit turns out to be spacelike ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the counter - streaming particles would have a limitation from the point of view of their redshift and this could play an important role in the analysis of particle motion in the disk associated with the virgo cluster . from this discussion",
    "it follows that given any stationary axisymmetric metric representing an astrophysical situation , one can straightaway determine constraints on possible physical parameters characterising the geodesic orbits through the behaviour of the drag index .    though newtonian physics does not directly predict anything regarding the nature of spacetime as influenced by rotation , it is amazing to see that the cumulative drag index shows exactly similar behaviour in the newtonian approximation for the case of the full kerr geometry as well as for the neugebauer - meinel disk geometry ( fig .",
    "( [ fig : cdi - ncdi ] ) ) , for all values of @xmath36 and @xmath63 , either prograde or retrograde .",
    "thus it is clear that the cumulative drag index defined above characterises an intrinsic property of spacetime with rotation , which goes beyond approximations .",
    "the fact that it is positive for both co- and counter - rotating particles having reasonable angular velocities , outside the ergo - region of a black hole or in a self - gravitating disk , clearly supports the possibility of sustaining counter - rotating streams .",
    "in fact , this analysis points out a constraint on the @xmath64 value for counterrotating streams to be @xmath83 , which might be tested in the case of streams encountered in the virgo cluster . eventhough the drag index itself does not measure any observable quantity directly , it characterises intrinsic rotation for stationary , axisymmetric spacetimes , be it in an empty region ( like kerr geometry ) or within a rotating disk ( neugebauer - meinel class of solutions ) , independent of approximations .",
    "if the metric potentials depend upon a directly observable parameter then the behaviour of the index for different combinations of rotational parameters could possibly give constraints on the physical parameter , which may be measurable .",
    "further , as the free orbits are defined through the equilibration of the forces acting on a particle , the index would go to infinity and thus studying the behaviour of the index in general yields information for orbits both free and otherwise .",
    "thus for the case of stationary axisymmetric metrics , the location of geodesics for given angular velocity and rotational parameters may be identified by plotting the drag index without necessarily solving the equations of motion .",
    "we wish to thank jayant narlikar for raising the question of the newtonian limit of the drag index which led to the investigations presented above , and the referees for some useful comments .",
