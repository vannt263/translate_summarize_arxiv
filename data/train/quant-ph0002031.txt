    "<S> an experimental test of relativistic wave - packet collapse is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the tested model assumes that the collapse takes place in the reference frame determined by the massive measuring detectors . </S>",
    "<S> entangled photons are measured at 10 km distance within a time interval of less than 5 ps . </S>",
    "<S> the two apparatuses are in relative motion so that both detectors , each in its own inertial reference frame , are first to perform the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the data always reproduces the quantum correlations and thus rule out a class of collapse models . </S>",
    "<S> the results also set a lower bound on the  speed of quantum information  to @xmath0 and @xmath1 times the speed of light in the geneva and the background radiation reference frames , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the very difficult and deep question of where the collapse takes place - if it takes place at all - is considered in a concrete experimental context .    2.0 cm    entanglement , one of the most important features of quantum mechanics , is at the core of the famous einstein - bohr philosophical debate @xcite and is the principal resource for quantum information processing @xcite . the tension between quantum mechanics and relativity has already received quite a lot of attention in the context of local hidden variables and bell inequality . there </S>",
    "<S> the idea was to complete quantum mechanics with additional variables that would reduce it to a classical theory . here </S>",
    "<S> the intuition is that this tension could be a guide for new physics , beyond quantum mechanics .    despite the lack of a completely loophole free test of bell inequality </S>",
    "<S> , the vast majority of physicists is convinced that quantum mechanics correctly describes the atomic world , including the correlation between distant systems , and we fully support this conclusion . yet , some physicists would like to treat the state vector @xmath2 as describing an objective reality and not merely the physicists information . </S>",
    "<S> we feel that such an approach is of interest , especially when it offers new experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty of realistic interpretations comes from the `` wave packet collapse '' and there seem to be only two alternatives . </S>",
    "<S> the first one assumes that the collapse is only a relative phenomenon : the observer , the measuring apparatus and the quantum system under test all get correlated in a way described by the schrdinger equation such that all future observations are consistent . in this description </S>",
    "<S> there is no real random choice , rather all outcomes happen in different worlds that are in quantum superposition ( a so - called many - world or relative state interpretation  la everett @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second alternative assumes a real collapse with a real objective choice . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that there is no observable difference between these alternatives . however , this conclusion depends on the exact form of the postulated collapse . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the grw @xcite and the primary state diffusion @xcite models predict tiny differences , though these are not measurable with today s technology .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we test the assumption of real collapse in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , we follow the idea put forward by suarez and scarani that the collapse takes place in the reference frame determined by the measuring apparatus @xcite . next , we set experimental limits on the speed of the collapse , both in the reference frame defined by the massive environment of the experiment , that is in the geneva reference frame , and in the reference frame determined by the cosmic background radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> let us elaborate on the intuition of suarez and scarani . </S>",
    "<S> each measuring apparatus defines a reference frame that we call measuring frame . in each measuring frame </S>",
    "<S> some measurements ( performed on distant systems ) happen before this one , while some happen later . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption is that the probabilities of outcomes are determined by the local quantum state ( as in standard quantum mechanics ) and that the local quantum state is collapsed by all the measurements that happened before in this measuring frame . </S>",
    "<S> if there is only one measuring frame , then this is identical to quantum mechanics with the projection postulate , hence the predictions are indistinguishable from those of standard quantum mechanics . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> they are compatible with all previous experiments . however , when applied to epr - like situations with two distant and moving measuring apparatuses , defining different reference frames@xcite , special relativity implies that the chronology of the measurements can differ from one measuring frame to another . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the case of two entangled distant systems that for convenience we attribute to alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> assume first that in both measuring frames alice s measurement takes place before bob s . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case alice produces first an outcome with probabilities determined by her local state ( obtained by tracing over bob s system ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , bob produces an outcome with probabilities also determined by his local state , but this state takes into account alice s result ( i.e. bob s state is collapsed ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite common reasoning . </S>",
    "<S> assume next that alice and bob are in relative motion such that in each of the two measuring frames the local measurement takes place before the distant one . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the probabilities of each result are determined by the local state without any collapse and models  la suarez - scarani predict no correlations at all . </S>",
    "<S> this is in strong opposition to the quantum mechanical predictions according to which the correlation should be observed independently of any time ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the case that both measurements take place after the distant one is discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize how natural our tests are in the context of assumed real collapses . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since the collapse is non local , if it is a real physical phenomenon it must happen in some privileged frame . </S>",
    "<S> it is then natural to assume that the latter is either defined by the measuring apparatus , or by the massive environment , or by the background radiation field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive aspect of these ideas is that they lead to difficult but feasible experiments which could severely reduce the room for `` real collapse models '' . </S>",
    "<S> they also set the question of what is a measurement in a concrete context , since the measuring device determines the relevant measuring frame @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the general idea of collapse models  la suarez - scarani is clear . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to design feasible tests , a more specific model has to be elaborated . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , to test the general idea an entire measurement apparatus would have to be put in relativistic motion . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , in any collapse model there is an assumed intrinsic irreversible choice after which the collapse has happened . </S>",
    "<S> it thus suffices to speed up the device where this happens . </S>",
    "<S> we call this device the _ choice device_. in their original work , suarez and scarani @xcite assumed that the beam - splitters are the choice devices , inspired by bohm s model . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment described in this letter tests the more conventional assumption that collapses are produced by all detectors and absorbing materials . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for the latter is that the relevant physics in detectors happens in the first layers where the irreversible absorption takes place in less than a picosecond . </S>",
    "<S> note that negative results , i.e. particle not detected or not absorbed , do also produce a collapse . in summary , the first detector or absorber encountered by any particle acts as the _ choice device_. in a binary choice , as in our experiment , when a particle encounters a second detector or absorber in the absolute future of the _ choice device _ , then the collapse already happened and there is no longer any alternative : the second device merely reveals the choice made by the _ choice device_.    in order to test the above model , we took advantage of our long - distance bell - experiment presented earlier in more detail @xcite , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a source of energy - time entangled photons is located in a swisscom terminal in the center of geneva . </S>",
    "<S> the photons are sent through the optical fiber telecom network to two villages , bellevue and bernex separated by 10.6 km . there , the photons are analyzed by two identically imbalanced fiber optic michelson interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> the cases when the photons either both take the short arm of their interferometers , or both take the long arm , are indistinguishable , leading to interference according to feynman s criterion . </S>",
    "<S> one interferometer is kept at a constant temperature , while the temperature of the other one is scanned , producing a phase variation . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus continuously measure the correlation as a function of the phase .    according to special relativity </S>",
    "<S> the time ordering of the measurements differ between the two measuring frames only if their relative speed @xmath3 and their time difference @xmath4 satisfy : @xmath5 where @xmath6 km is the straight line distance between alice and bob . consequently , assuming a speed @xmath3 of 100 m / s and a safety margin of 2 , a @xmath7 ps timing accuracy is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> note that achieving this automatically provides a bound on the speed of the assumed collapse . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if both measurements take place before the quantum information from the distant measurement result reaches them , then no correlation would be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the technical challenges are thus , first to achieve a speed of 100 m / s , next to adjust the fibers relative lengths below 5 ps ( corresponding to 1 mm , each fiber being about 10 km long ) , third to master the dispersion such that the pulse spreading remains below 5 ps .    to achieve an absorber speed of 105 m/s we use a 20 cm diameter black - painted aluminium disk of 1 cm thickness directly driven by a brushless 250w dc motor ( maxon ec ) turning vertically at 10000 rpm . </S>",
    "<S> during the absorption , the circular motion provides a good approximation to a linear one , defining thus the inertial reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> it is oriented with a compass to make it run away or towards the other observer .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the fiber lengths adjustment and dispersion management . </S>",
    "<S> to adjust roughly the distances from the source to the detectors we add 1.5 km of optical fiber on a spool on the link to bellevue . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to equilibrate the chromatic dispersions , we add about 500 meters of dispersion shifted fiber on the link to bernex , this is necessary because the dispersion of this link is higher ( dispersion shifted fibers have relatively high negative dispersion around 1300 nm ) . finally , each fiber link measures in total about 10 km and has about 9 db losses . </S>",
    "<S> next , the fiber lengths are measured with a home made otdr ( optical time domain reflectometer ) with a precision of a few cm . </S>",
    "<S> short fiber pigtails are used for this adjustment . in a further step , </S>",
    "<S> we use another home made low coherence interferometer @xcite with 100 @xmath8 resolution ( using a led with a 2 nm fwhm interference filter ) . </S>",
    "<S> fine tuning is realized by pulling on a 2 meter long fiber on a rail with a micrometer - screw ( optical fibers have 1% elasticity ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion induced spreading of the wavepackets may easily be larger than the achievable precision of the positioning . to limit the spreading we take advantage of the 2-photon chromatic dispersion cancellation phenomena </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : if the central wavelength of the downconverted photons is precisely at the ( average ) zero chromatic dispersion wavelength of the two fibers , then , in the domain where chromatic dispersion varies linearly , both photons undergo exactly the same delay . </S>",
    "<S> we thus measured accurately and equilibrated the chromatic dispersion of the fiber links and found the zero chromatic dispersion wavelength with a precision of @xmath9 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty together with non - linear chromatic dispersion determines the width of the 2-photon wave - packet . reducing the bandwidth of the downconverted photon with a 10 nm filter </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that the resulting spread is below 5 ps ( for a detailed analysis , see @xcite ) .    due to daily thermal expansion , the optical lengths between geneva and each of the villages changes by several mm over day . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that bernex is drifting further away during the daytime , since this link is more exposed to temperature variations . </S>",
    "<S> the drift proves to be monotonic , in one direction during the day and in the other one during the night . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we aligned the paths taking in account the daily drift such that the optical distances from the source to the two interferometers will be perfectly equal some time later . during these few hours </S>",
    "<S> we continuously record the 2-photon interference fringes , scanning the phase of the bellevue interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> after an acquisition we confirm with a second measurement that the path lengths really passed through the equilibrium point . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we are sure that some fringes are collected when the fiber lengths difference is smaller than 1 mm ( corresponding to 5 ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> many interferograms were collected over various day and night periods and measurement times . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 displays typical data taken over 6 hours while the optical link to bernex lengthened by 2 mm with respect to the one to bellevue and the wheel was rotating , such that both measurements where  before the other  over almost the entire scan . </S>",
    "<S> inevitably , the curves show high statistical fluctuations due to the low count rate . in spite of this </S>",
    "<S> , one can state that the visibility of the two photon interferogram remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> especially , a reduced visibility over a scan span of 5 ps , as predicted by the model under test , should easily be noticed . </S>",
    "<S> after substraction of the 237@xmath10 cts/100s accidental coincidences ( which are caused by the well understood phenomenon of dark counts and which we measured independently ) , the fit of fig 2 shows a constant fringe visibility of 83% @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also measured interferograms corresponding to the  </S>",
    "<S> after - after  </S>",
    "<S> configuration by inversing the rotation of the wheel , again with no evidence for a breakdown of the correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we like to mention that with the detectors as  choice device  a breakdown of the correlations would allow to exploit  non - locality  for superluminal communication by slightly adapting the setup @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results do also demonstrate quantum correlation measurements quasi - simultaneous in the natural geneva reference frame , setting a conservative , nevertheless impressive lower bound on the speed of any hypothetical quantum influence , with @xmath11 the speed of light :    @xmath12    this speed remains superluminal in all reference frames , in particular in that defined by the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) . </S>",
    "<S> our earth moves at a mean speed of 371 km / s relative to this single - out frame . due to the earth rotations , both around its axis and around the sun , the date and time when </S>",
    "<S> the data were taken and the orientation of the experiment are relevant to establish the corresponding bound . a detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite . taking into account the bellevue - bernex orientation ( almost exactly north - south ) , the worst case correspond to a delay of 37 ns in the cbr frame and we we get a conservative bound close to @xmath13c . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed this experiment without the rotating wheel and with two aligned detectors ( apd 1 & 2 on fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that for this bound , the 5 ps timing in the geneva reference frame is unnecessary since anyway the timing in the background radiation frame is much less precise . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we could relax the constraint on the spectral width of the photons , accepting larger dispersion and performed this experiment without the rotating wheel and with two aligned detectors ( apd 1 & 2 on fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides much higher counting rates , improves the signal to noise ratio and sets a bound of @xmath14c to the speed of quantum information in the cbr frame @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize again that the above bound on the speed of  quantum information  </S>",
    "<S> ( quantum state preparation ) is not in conflict with relativity . </S>",
    "<S> what can be said is that alice can predict with certainty the quantum state of a photon 10 km away which was still in a completely mixed state some ps before . </S>",
    "<S> whether this implies the transmission of some kind of information ( or influence ) is a matter of debate and models @xcite . in this respect the recent progress on evaluating </S>",
    "<S> the cost of classical communication for the simulation of quantum correlation is interesting @xcite : to simulate our experiment with classical communication one would not only need superluminal communication , but the extreme speed of 10 million time the speed of light .    </S>",
    "<S> we presented results of two experiments that go beyond the standard tests of bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> their objectives are to explore experimentally the possible limits of quantum mechanics , to test the most peculiar predictions of quantum physics and to open the road for further experimental investigations of these no - longer purely philosophical questions . </S>",
    "<S> our results fully support the quantum predictions , re - enforcing our confidence in the possibility to base future understanding of our world and future technology on quantum principles . </S>",
    "<S> they also contributes to the renewed interest for experimental challenges to the interpretation of quantum mechanics .  experimental metaphysics  </S>",
    "<S> questions @xcite like  what about the concept of states ? </S>",
    "<S>  ,  the concept of causalities ? </S>",
    "<S>  will have to be ( re)considered taking into account the results presented in this letter . for example , our results make it more difficult to view the  projection postulate  as a compact description of a real physical phenomenon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however this is only a first example of this new class of tests and further experiments are needed before general conclusions can be made .    </S>",
    "<S> this work would not have been possible without the financial support of the `` fondation odier de psycho - physique '' . </S>",
    "<S> it also profited from support by swisscom and the swiss national science foundation . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank a. suarez and v. scarani for very stimulating discussions and h. inamori for preparing work during his stay in our lab .    </S>",
