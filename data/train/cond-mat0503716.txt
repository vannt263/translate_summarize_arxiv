    "the study of spin - polarized transport across interfaces is a subject of long history  @xcite .",
    "the recent advent of semiconductor - based electronic devices at the nanoscale has revived the interest in transferring , controlling and detecting spin currents .",
    "this research area has been termed _",
    "spintronics _ due to the exciting possibility of future , successful spin - based electronic technology  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , spintronics is interesting as well for fundamental physics , both experimentally and theoretically , as its basic constituent  the spin  is of quantum nature only .",
    "the most simple building block of spintronic transport systems is probably the magnetic tunnel junction .",
    "it comprises two ferromagnetic electrodes sandwiching a paramagnetic layer .",
    "vertical transport , where current flows across the interfaces , is characterized by the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) , which measures the relative change in the junction resistance when the contacts magnetizations is changed from parallel to antiparallel alignment  @xcite .",
    "the tmr is also important in investigating the properties of spintronic resonant tunneling diodes .",
    "remarkably , such devices have been recently built in all - semiconductor heterostructures , taking advantage of diluted magnetic semiconductors made of iii - v  @xcite ( hole - like transport ) and ii - vi compounds  @xcite ( electron - like transport ) .    when the size of the paramagnetic island in a magnetic tunnel junction becomes comparable to the carrier fermi wavelength , the system behaves effectively as zero - dimensional .",
    "then , quantum effects arise from the quasi - localized nature of electrons and from the phase - coherent transport .",
    "the ultimate miniaturization limit is just a single resonant level coupled to a fermi sea of itinerant electrons , which may be regarded as an artificial realization of the quantum _ impurity problem _  @xcite .",
    "extensive studies of the impurity problem have been performed in semiconductor _ quantum dots _",
    "@xcite , where the island ( an electron droplet ) is formed by means of a constriction in a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "both the discrete energy levels and the tunneling couplings may be tuned almost at will .",
    "very recently , a few experimental works have begun to deal with spin polarized leads  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider spintronic transport through quantum dots with strong correlations .",
    "it is well known that the electron - electron interaction interaction plays a dominant role in the low temperature transport through quantum dots  @xcite . in the coulomb blockade regime",
    ", the electron dynamics can be described in terms of single - electron tunneling plus mean - field charging effects . between two coulomb blockade peaks ,",
    "transport is blockaded and the electron number in the dot does not fluctuate . when the electron number is odd , the topmost resonant level is singly occupied .",
    "however , when temperature approaches the energy scale @xmath0 , the spin of the localized electron becomes screened by an antiferromagnetic interaction with the conduction band electrons .",
    "the resulting strong correlations arise from the interplay of higher order tunneling processes and the on - site coulomb interaction . as a consequence ,",
    "the many - body state in the @xmath1 limit is a singlet formed between the quantum impurity and the continuum electrons .",
    "the impact in the transport properties of the system is strong ; e.g. , the temperature - dependent conductance results in a universal function of @xmath2 , achieving the quantum limit ( @xmath3 per spin ) at @xmath1 .",
    "this is the celebrated kondo effect  @xcite in quantum dots  @xcite , which was observed several years ago  @xcite .",
    "now , an important condition for the kondo effect to take place is the degeneracy ( between spins up and down ) of the ground state of the dot .",
    "such spin degeneracy may be broken with an external magnetic field ( zeeman splitting ) and is well understood  @xcite .",
    "but will the kondo effect be preserved when the spin transfer across the tunnel barrier is spin - dependent ?",
    "how will the conventional picture of the kondo resonance in quantum dots be affected within a spin - polarized medium ? to answer these questions various theoretical groups have lately contributed  . although these works differ in some predictions due to the range of applicability of the distinct approaches used therein and their limitations , the analysis of the problem with numerical renormalization group  @xcite have led to the conclusion that the kondo state is robust enough ( though with a lower @xmath4 ) against nonzero spin polarizations in the leads when particle - hole symmetry is not broken and real charge fluctuations are completely suppressed  @xcite . note that particle - hole asymmetry may be induced in the dot with nearby electric gates , shifting the resonant level away from the symmetric point ( see below )  @xcite .",
    "we predict that this would give rise to a sharp decrease of the linear - response conductance .",
    "since the phenomenon is absent when the magnetizations of the electrodes point along opposite directions ( antiparallel alignment ) , we propose  @xcite the tmr as a possible experimental signature of this _ spintronic kondo effect_.    another important element of many theories of spintronic transport is the description of intrinsic `` spin relaxation '' mechanisms that allow for nonequilibrium spin populations to relax .",
    "long spin coherence times @xmath5 have been reported in semiconductor quantum wells  @xcite and dots  @xcite .",
    "the effect of spin relaxation is known to reduce the tmr for a coulomb - blockaded quantum dot  @xcite and it leads to a suppression of the fano factor ( shot noise ) in the antiparallel configuration  @xcite . at lower temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , spin decoherence causes the destruction of the kondo effect due the failure of the formation of the many - body singlet state .",
    "one could also think about more coherent `` spin - flip '' process , e.g. , arising from the potential spin - orbit coupling which causes the rotation of electron spin in the dot ( this effect of spin - orbit coupling for the localized electron should be distinguished from that of the spin - orbit coupling of conduction electrons , which due to time - reversal symmetry has no influence on the kondo effect  @xcite ) . more specifically , when the amplitude of spin flip scattering rate is larger than the kondo temperature , @xmath7 , the density of states ( dos ) at the impurity site is expected to develop a splitting and thus a decrease of the linear conductance .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed with equation - of - motion technique  @xcite , slave - boson mean - field theory  @xcite and numerical renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "therefore , spin - flip processes , coherent or incoherent , tend to suppress the kondo effect .",
    "we model the quantum dot as a single discrete level with energy @xmath8 containing an unpaired spin-@xmath9 electron with @xmath10 and charging energy @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the dot is an electronic impurity tunnelling coupled to continuum electrons with a model hamiltonian given by the anderson hamiltonian : @xmath12 where ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) @xmath13 are written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators in the dot @xmath14 ( the occupation number is defined as @xmath15 ) and in the leads @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the wavevector and @xmath18 labeling left ( @xmath19 ) and right ( @xmath20 ) reservoirs .",
    "tunneling of electrons from the dot to the leads is described by the hopping parameter @xmath21 . in @xmath22",
    "included is an internal spin - flip process with rate @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "notice that in this framework the spin - flip process is purely coherent , and precisely speaking it does not account for incoherent spin relaxation processes .",
    "it may originate either from the transverse component of an applied magnetic field or from a tunable spin - orbit coupling of the rashba - dresselhaus type _ in the dot _",
    "@xcite ( see the introduction and compare with ref .",
    "since the spin - flip processes , coherent or incoherent , have similar influence on kondo effect , we leave the term in @xmath24 in @xmath25 phenomenological .",
    "what is important here is that @xmath24 lifts the degeneracy of the discrete level and that it can not be eliminated with a unitary transformation since the lead magnetizations already mark a privileged spin direction . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the su(2 ) symmetry",
    "is broken and the spin symmetry of the problem is u(1 ) whereas in the presence of both spin flip scattering and ferromagnetic electrodes , the u(1 ) spin symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "due to coupling to the leads , the electron in the dot becomes quasilocalized with a escaping rate related to the hybridization broadening , @xmath28 .",
    "this is the imaginary part of the hopping self - energy , which is spin - dependent because tunneling is spin - dependent .",
    "this can be achieved by coupling the dot to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we take constant tunneling coefficients @xmath29 and equal tunnel barriers ( symmetric couplings : @xmath30 ) . in the wide - band limit ,",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath31 is unimportant ( which is a good approximation for low voltages ) .",
    "moreover , we assume that the degree of spin polarization on lead @xmath18 is given by @xmath32 notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq_p ] ) is already a gross simplification as it might well be that @xmath33 has little to do with the real magnetization of the reservoir .",
    "in fact , various definitions for @xmath34 are possible depending on the experiment  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we neglect proximity effects such as stray fields coming from the ferromagnets and consider that the bandwidth @xmath35 is spin independent .",
    "[ we prefer not to delve into details since already the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_p ] ) gives rise to nontrivial effects which can be directly measured ] .",
    "we consider collinear magnetizations , both in parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) configurations . with the approximations discussed above , we have for the p case ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , whereas the ap case ( @xmath40 ) yields @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us first provide an intuitive picture of the influence of spin - polarized transport in the kondo resonance at @xmath26 . we take @xmath43 . for p alignment in the fully polarized case ( @xmath44 )",
    ", the singlet state can not form due to the lack of spin down electrons .",
    "hence , we expect a decrease of the kondo temperature ( @xmath4 is roughly the binding energy of the singlet state ) with increasing @xmath34 . in the ap configuration ( @xmath45 ) , however , the kondo effect survives since an spin up ( down ) localized electron may be screened by the right ( left ) electrode .",
    "of course , the conductance would be zero unless a vanishingly small @xmath24 is allowed to come into play .",
    "now , in the p case there may arise an exchange field  @xcite acting on the dot as an effective zeeman splitting  @xcite .",
    "is the kondo effect robust against this exchange field ?",
    "the answer is yes !",
    "when the gate voltage is tuned in such a way that @xmath46 ( the symmetric anderson model ) , charge fluctuations become suppressed . only when particle - hole symmetry is broken ( @xmath47 ) do we find a splitting in the kondo peak of the local dos .",
    "we briefly review now the different theoretical methods employed to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_h ] ) .",
    "the equation - of - motion technique  @xcite is useful to study nonequilibrium situations ( for finite bias ) at relatively `` high '' temperatures ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "although it reproduces qualitatively the dos peaks , it fails to describe properly the strong coupling regime , where kondo physics completely quenches the impurity spin . when applied to our problem",
    ", it predicts the exchange field induced splitting but not its disappearance at @xmath46 . on the other hand , slave - boson mean - field theory  @xcite correctly accounts for the fermi - liquid fixed point of the kondo problem at @xmath1 . as a result , it is only valid when the particle - hole symmetry is not broken ( no splitting ) .",
    "the noncrossing approximation  @xcite is another slave - boson based approach and offers a consistent picture of the kondo effect at @xmath0 .",
    "however , it does not take into account vertex corrections and produces spurious peaks at @xmath49 in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "finally , a numerical renormalization group calculation  @xcite encompasses the whole regime but remains valid only at equilibrium .    in the following , we report results using the interpolative @xmath11-finite perturbation theory  @xcite since it gives a good description of the dynamical properties of eq .",
    "( [ eq_h ] ) for a wide range of parameters .",
    "it can describes both , the kondo regime and the mixed - valence regime ( where the dot level is close to @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "however , in this approach the width of the kondo resonance decreases algebraically instead of having an exponentional decay .",
    "then , we elaborate as well on a numerical renormalization group analysis , which leads to _ nonperturbative _ results for all the regimes listed above .",
    "as indicated above , the kondo resonance for a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnets with parallel magnetizations , splits away from the symmetric case ( @xmath51 ) where charge fluctuations are important .",

    "( [ eq_su4 ] ) @xmath170 is a coupling constant which goes to the strongly fixed point in the flow diagram .",
    "we recall that the su(4 ) kondo state takes place provided there are two conduction channels ( described by the matrix @xmath171 ) .",
    "the latter equation explains the entanglement between the spin and the orbital electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the transport properties of a su(4 ) kondo state strongly differ from the conventional su(2 )",
    "kondo state , both at equilibrium and out of equilibrium  @xcite . first , the kondo temperature inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq_su4 ] ) is largely enhanced ( around 200 times ) as compared to @xmath4 of a spin kondo system  @xcite .",
    "this means that the differential conductance peak ( which mimics the dqd density of states ) becomes greatly broadened in a transition from the su(2 ) to the su(4 ) kondo physics .",
    "such a transition can be tuned with a magnetic flux in an aharonov - bohm interferometer with one dot at each arm  @xcite .",
    "second , the kondo resonance is no longer peaked at @xmath49 but at @xmath172 to fulfill the friedel - langreth sum rule  @xcite .    how would spintronic transport modify a su(4 ) kondo resonance ?",
    "in the presence of ferromagnetic leads and away from the particle - hole symmetry point , we expect the spin part of the kondo state to slowly vanish with increasing lead polarization .",
    "experimentally , one would see a splitting of the kondo resonance into _ three _ peaks .",
    "the centered peak would still correspond to the pseudospin kondo state , which is not sensitive to the magnetization at the leads . at the same time , @xmath173 decreases but the linear conductance would increase since the su(2 ) kondo resonance associated to the orbital kondo effect peaks at @xmath49 again . to further destroy the pseudospin kondo state ,",
    "two possibilities emerge from an analogy with the spin case .",
    "first , one allows for tunneling between the dots , which breaks the fourfold degeneracy favoring the formation of a bonding ( symmetric ) state between the dots .",
    "then , interdot tunneling acts as an external zeeman splitting in the spin sector .",
    "second , one could consider asymmetric couplings of the dqd to the leads ; e.g. , the dqd system may be coupled strongly to the left lead , @xmath174 . this way , we regard the leads as _ pseudospin polarized _ much like the spin - dependent tunneling due to ferromagnetic leads in the spin case",
    ". we may even define the pseudospin polarization for each spin species as @xmath175 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq_p ] ) ] . at this point ,",
    "more calculations are needed to further exploit this analogy between spins and pseudospins , which may give rise to a unifying picture of the influence of real and pseudo - spin polarized leads in the transport through quantum - dot structures .",
    "we have investigated the spintronic properties of a quantum dot in the kondo regime .",
    "we have considered a dot attached to ferromagnetic leads and in the presence of intradot spin flip scattering . using both perturbation theory in the on - site interaction and the nrg method ,",
    "we have shown that the kondo effect is not necessarily suppressed by the spin polarizations of the leads : for the symmetric anderson model , where charge fluctuations are completely suppressed , the kondo effect is robust even for finite polarizations . for the asymmetric anderson model ,",
    "the kondo peak does split into two .",
    "this is due to the presence or absence of particle - hole symmetry . in the presence of particle - hole symmetry , the kondo peak at the fermi level",
    "remains unsplit even at finite polarizations and the linear conductance achieves the unitary limit .",
    "this remains true as long as only spin fluctuations are present in the qd . on the contrary ,",
    "when particle - hole symmetry is absent , the conductance is suppressed due to the visible splitting of the kondo peak .",
    "since the kondo resonance is mostly unaltered for antiparallel magnetizations , we have calculated the tmr in the kondo , mixed - valence , and empty - level regimes .",
    "the tmr shows a characteristic behavior for each of them .",
    "in addition , we have shown that the tmr is strongly affected in the presence of spin flip processes .",
    "we have studied the form of the shot noise when charge fluctuations are completely suppressed .",
    "we have shown that the fano factor approaches the poissonian limit when the spin flip scattering rate is of the order of the kondo temperature .",
    "for parallel arrangements , the fano factor enhances with increasing lead polarizations .",
    "moreover , we have suggested and discussed possible new advances in this field such as the influence of magnons in the kondo state of a quantum dot , the effect of spin - polarized currents on double - quantum - dot systems mimicking the two - impurity problem and on more exotic kondo states with higher symmetry .",
    "the physics addressed in this paper is realistic and can be visible within the scope of present techniques as the energies we treat are within the kondo scale . in particular , a change has been detected in the resistivity of a kondo alloy due to spin - polarized currents  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is already possible to attach ferromagnetic leads to a carbon nanotube  @xcite , and a carbon - nanotube quantum dot has been shown to display kondo physics below an unusually high temperature  @xcite . finally , a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes has been proposed as a promising candidate for spin injection devices , and studied experimentally both in the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite and in the kondo regime@xcite .",
