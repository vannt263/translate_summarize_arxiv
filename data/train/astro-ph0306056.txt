    "recent results @xcite supplied the first strong evidence for solar - like oscillations in stars and opened a new era in this field . in principle , asteroseismology has the potential to determine the basic parameters of the stars such as mass , composition etc .",
    "this promise motivates extending our knowledge on solar - like oscillations .",
    "@xmath0 boo , at v@xmath10 is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is classified as a k1.5 iii red giant @xcite .",
    "its effective temperature and radius were estimated as @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "its parallax derived by hipparcos is 88.85@xmath50.74 milli - arc sec @xcite , which translates to a distance of 11.26@xmath50.09 pc .",
    "@xcite carried out a radial velocity study of @xmath6 during 82 hours in two weeks in 1988 april - may .",
    "they found variability at frequencies around several @xmath2 .",
    "the highest peak in their power spectrum corresponded to 4.3 @xmath2 , with an amplitude of 60 ms@xmath7 .",
    "belmonte et al . listed 19 frequencies and suggested a frequency spacing of @xmath1 5 @xmath2 , although this interpretation was questioned by @xcite .",
    "in addition , belmonte et al . obtained 18.5 hours of photometry of the star during three nights in 1988 april and argued that these are consistent with the results of the radial measurements .",
    "they concluded that the most plausible explanation for the variability of @xmath6 is stellar oscillations .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath6 in radial velocity during eight consecutive nights in 1992 june .",
    "they found power at frequencies of 4.70 , 3.05 and 1.36 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite presented three and a half years of intermittent radial velocity measurements on arcturus .",
    "these show clearly that it has variations of the order of several hundreds ms@xmath7 on the long - term .",
    "while analysis of densely covered parts of the data suggests the presence of several periodicities , the strongest at @xmath1 3 d , there was no dominant peak in the power spectrum of the whole data .",
    "@xcite concluded that these variations are non - coherent stellar oscillations .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the only high - precision photometry of arcturus to date is from hipparcos @xcite .",
    "these show that @xmath6 has optical variations with an amplitude of a few percent . here",
    "we present new photometric observations of @xmath6 from the _ wire _ spacecraft and argue that the variability of arcturus can indeed be understood by stellar oscillations , although it is not clear whether these are coherent p - mode oscillations .",
    "after the failure of the main mission of the wide field infrared explorer ( _ wire _ ) satellite , launched by nasa in 1999 march , its star tracker was extensively used for asteroseismology of bright objects @xcite .",
    "the observations of @xmath6 were obtained during 19 successive days in 2000 july - august using a @xmath8 site ccd with 27 @xmath9 pixels ; each pixel subtends approximately one arc minute on the sky .",
    "the camera is unfiltered and the effective response is roughly @xmath10 .",
    "the observations were carried out with a cadence of 0.5 seconds . as described by @xcite , data reduction began by applying a simple aperture photometry algorithm , which involved summing the central @xmath11 pixel region of the window of @xmath12 pixels that can be read .",
    "the background level , due primarily to scattered light from the bright earth , was estimated from the four corner pixels of each image , and subtracted .",
    "we note that @xmath6 was bright enough to cause overflows of the onboard analog - to - digital converter in the central region of the image . however , we verified through examination of count histograms for individual ccd pixels that the ccd itself was never saturated , and we were thus easily able to reconstruct the actual count rates .",
    "a total of 1,284,164 data points were acquired during the observing run .    following aperture photometry ,",
    "a clipping algorithm was applied to the time series , resulting in the rejection of any points deviating more than @xmath13 from the mean flux , image centroid , or background level . in practice , at this point in the data reduction process , the rms noise in the signal was extremely large ( about 25 parts per thousand ( ppt ) ) due to incomplete subtraction of scattered light , so clipping in this way only removes truly deviant points .",
    "the majority of these were due either to data from the wrong @xmath12 ccd window being returned , or to data acquired before the spacecraft pointing had settled during a particular orbital segment .",
    "the crude scattered light removal discussed above is clearly inadequate , particularly for observations made early in each orbital segment when the target was close to the limb of the bright earth and the background level was therefore especially high .",
    "in fact , much of the difficulty inherent in the reduction of _ wire _ photometric data is in successfully characterizing and removing the scattered light signature @xcite . in this case",
    ", we phased the background data at the satellite orbital period ( 96 min ) and binned the result in steps of phase @xmath14 . the result is shown in fig .  1 , where the zero point for orbital phase is arbitrarily chosen .",
    "the spikes at @xmath15=0.34 and @xmath15=0.75 represent the start and end , respectively , of observations during the orbit .",
    "note that points with large scattered light levels are confined to a small range of orbital phase ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and that these points represent only a small fraction of the observations , especially since the majority of orbital segments do not even contain observations made at these phases .",
    "accordingly , we simply discarded points with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for the remaining points",
    ", we fitted a spline to the relation shown in fig .  1 and removed it from the data .",
    "the resulting time series contained 1,163,420 points , with an rms noise level reduced by an order of magnitude , to 2.5 ppt .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  2 presents the light curve of arcturus .",
    "the data from each orbit have been binned into a single mean value , resulting in 252 final points . at jd=2451762",
    "there was a jump of about 5.5 ppt in the brightness of @xmath6 , however , at this time the location of the centroid of the star on the ccd was shifted relatively significantly ( fig .  2 , two middle panels ) .",
    "the jump is , therefore , instrumental .",
    "a further comparison between the light curve and the position of @xmath6 on the ccd suggests that some of the wiggles in the light curve are instrumental . in particular ,",
    "the light curves of single satellite orbits typically show linear trends of about 1 ppt , which were definitely correlated with the location of the star on the ccd .",
    "these effects are presumably due to sub - pixel structure in the ccd sensitivity .    to remove the effect that minor shifts in the location of the star in the ccd have on the light curve",
    ", we used the decorrelation method @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the brightness of @xmath6 was constant during single satellite orbits and that the short - term light changes were purely an instrumental effect . using only the data from the first orbit we fitted a linearized dependence between the coordinates of the star centroid and brightness as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the measured signal",
    ", @xmath22 is the assumed constant flux of the star and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the instrumental coefficients . by subtracting @xmath25 from the data in all other orbits ,",
    "we largely remove the instrumental effect .",
    "the result is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it is clear that most of the dependence in the location of the star has disappeared and that @xmath6 shows changes on time scales of several days .",
    "we note that using different orbits to measure the coefficients or adding the higher term ( @xmath26 ) to the above function had negligible effect on the decorrelated light curve .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  3 displays the amplitude spectrum of the observations after subtracting a linear term from the raw data .",
    "the second and third panels represent the amplitude spectrum of the shifts in the x- and y - axis respectively .",
    "the fourth panel in fig .",
    "3 shows the amplitude spectrum of the decorrelated data .",
    "there is an excess of power at low frequencies , which is centered around 0.35 d@xmath7 ( 4.07 ) .",
    "this periodicity reflects the obvious changes in the light curve ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we analysed the amplitude spectrum using the conventional method of iterative sine - wave fitting .",
    "a synthetic light curve was built using a sinusoid at a frequency of 4.07-@xmath27hz , with the same amplitude as in the data and sampled according to the window function ( fig .  3 , fifth panel from top ) .",
    "we subtracted the 4.07-@xmath27hz signal from the data and calculated the amplitude spectrum of the residuals .",
    "the highest peak was at 0.27 d@xmath7 ( 3.09 @xmath27hz ) .",
    "we then returned to the original data , fitted simultaneously these two frequencies ( 4.07 and 3.09-@xmath27hz ) and found the third highest peak in the residual amplitude spectrum .",
    "this process was repeated for ten iterations .",
    "the result after subtracting eight peaks is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 . there is still some excess of power at low frequencies .",
    "table  1 lists the ten highest peaks in the amplitude spectrum found by simultaneous fitting of the frequencies .",
    "the typical errors on the frequencies are @xmath1 0.1 @xmath27hz .",
    "peak 5 ( 1.56 @xmath27hz ) is questionable , since the data extend over only @xmath1 2.5 cycles .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "4 presents the power spectrum ( amplitude squared ) at the frequency range of 0 - 20 @xmath27hz .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show the locations of the ten highest peaks .",
    "the long - dashed curve is the lorentzian fit to the power excess at low frequency using the maximum -likelihood method given by @xcite .",
    "the _ wire _ photometry clearly shows that @xmath6 is variable on time scales of a few days .",
    "there are several frequencies with semi - amplitudes of about one ppt or less in the amplitude spectrum .",
    "the amplitude and frequency of the power excess in arcturus found in this work are in excellent agreement with the predictions for solar - like oscillations based on scaling from the sun @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shape of the power excess is typical of solar - like oscillations @xcite and could be explained by a single mode with a damping life time of about 2 days ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "alternatively , to establish the presence of p - mode oscillations , we must demonstrate a regular series of peaks in the power spectrum .      to locate a possible p - mode structure in the @xmath6 data we first tried to fit a simple regular series of peaks to the frequencies we found ( assuming an asymptotic relation for radial modes ) .",
    "indeed , the frequencies fit a simple regular series having a separation between the modes of @xmath28=0.825@xmath50.049 .",
    "we note that we assume here that @xmath29 is the dominant mode and non - radial modes are negligible , which is expected from theoretical models @xcite .",
    "our suggested value for the frequency splitting is in excellent agreement with the expected value of 0.9@xmath50.2 @xmath27hz @xcite and perhaps consistent with the estimate of 0.6 @xmath27hz reported by @xcite ,  1.2@xmath30hz by assuming that the mode l=1 is also present . ] but not with the value of 5.0 @xmath27hz suggested by @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath28 is , however , close to our frequency resolution ( @xmath1 0.64 @xmath27hz ) , which is set by the length of the run .",
    "the same was true for the observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we carried out simulations to determine whether the regularity in the _ wire _ data can be attributed to p - modes .",
    "we generated a simulated time series as the sum of two noise sources : white noise ( i.e. , normally distributed ) plus non - white noise ( a random walk with a high - pass filter ) .",
    "we generated five simulations , each with the same sampling as the real data , but with different seeds for the random number generator .",
    "we then analyzed each noise spectrum in the same way as the real _ wire _ dataset .",
    "all simulations showed a somewhat regular series of peaks , with 6 to 8 peaks fitting the model .",
    "the value for the separation between the individual peaks was only slightly different from the value we found in arcturus ( within a half sigma ) .",
    "the scatter on the separation for the simulated time series data is also only slightly worse than what is found in arcturus ( within one sigma ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that we do not need a regular series of p - mode oscillations in order to produce the regularity observed in the _ wire _ data .",
    "we are thus unable , from the present data , to decide whether p - mode oscillations exist in arcturus or not .",
    "the above effect in arcturus is also able to explain the regular series of peaks , with a separation of 2.94 , observed in @xmath0 uma a by @xcite .",
    "a simulation similar to the one above for @xmath6 indicates that one , even in data containing pure noise and with a sampling like the one for @xmath0 uma a , will find a separation of 3.0@xmath50.3 @xmath2 with low scatter .",
    "this may explain the difference between observations and model calculations by @xcite .      could granulation noise , rather than oscillations , be responsible for the excess power ?",
    "this is unlikely , since the variability is also detected in velocity , with a semi - amplitude of @xmath1 60m@xmath31 at 4.3@xmath27hz @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the velocity amplitude to the photometric amplitude is about 60 ms@xmath7ppt@xmath7 .",
    "this is about twice that expected for sound waves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  5 ) , but more than seven times greater than observed in solar granulation noise @xcite .",
    "also , the power spectrum from granulation noise would be expected to continue rising towards low frequencies , which is not observed .",
    "we strongly established the suggestion that arcturus is photometrically variable . we conclude that the oscillations in arcturus can be explained by sound waves , but it is not clear whether these are coherent p - mode oscillations or perhaps a single mode with a short lifetime .",
    "the latter would explain the different frequencies found by various authors ( section  1 ) .",
    "a longer time series is required to distinguish between the two options .",
    "as theory predicts that non - radial modes should be unobservable in red giants @xcite , asteroseismology probably will not supply detailed information on these objects .",
    "detecting the @xmath29 modes of stellar oscillation has , however , the potential of estimating reliably the poorly known masses in red giants .",
    "our observations of arcturus are the first step towards this goal .",
    "we are grateful to all the people who made the use of the _ wire _ satellite possible .",
