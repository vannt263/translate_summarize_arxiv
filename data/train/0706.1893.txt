    "much has been written about brane world solutions to chiral gauged 6d supergravity .",
    "gibbons , gven and pope ( ggp ) @xcite found a wide class of such solutions , with 4d poincar symmetry and axial symmetry in the transverse dimensions . surrounding work focusing on the brane world interpretation of these backgrounds was made in @xcite .",
    "other classes of solutions have also been found , including those which break the axial symmetry @xcite , activate the hyperscalar fields @xcite , have 4d de sitter / anti de sitter slicings @xcite or time - dependent behaviour @xcite .",
    "the model additionally admits string solutions with dyonic charges @xcite .",
    "all these backgrounds are interesting because , among other things , they provide a framework in which to build cosmological models ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in order for these backgrounds to be phenomenologically relevant , however , we would like them to be stable against small perturbations .",
    "so far , the ggp solutions have proven to be classically marginally stable , despite the fact that they all but one ( _ i.e. _ the sphere - monopole limit ) break supersymmetry ( see @xcite , and also @xcite ) . meanwhile",
    ", we might also want to consider the 6d theory to be a low energy approximation to some consistent theory of quantum gravity , such as string theory .",
    "if this is the case we must insist on certain consistency constraints , and in particular , since the theory is chiral , we must insist on anomaly freedom .    in general , chiral",
    "6d supergravity suffers from a breakdown of local symmetries due to gravitational , gauge and mixed anomalies . for certain gauge groups and hypermultiplet representations",
    "these anomalies can be cancelled via a green - schwarz mechanism @xcite .",
    "this is entirely analogous to what happens in 10d , where the anomalies cancel only for a few models , namely those with gauge groups : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in 6d",
    "the consistency constraints are weaker , and by now a number of anomaly free models have been discovered @xcite . in table",
    "[ anomalyfree ] we present three of the known examples which have a large enough gauge group to include the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the structure of these anomaly free models seems suggestive that some of them may indeed be somehow related to critical string theory or m - theory @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , with regards to the stability of the brane world compactifications , the extra degrees of freedom required for anomaly cancellation can not be ignored .",
    "marginal stability was affirmed in @xcite , for the ggp solution in the salam - sezgin model , which has just an abelian @xmath7 gauge group and no hypermatter .",
    "we now ask if there is a similar dynamics in anomaly free models , which have larger field contents .    to this end",
    ", we may draw some lessons from the old literature on sphere compactifications , which are supported by monopole backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the stability of sphere compactifications for nonsupersymmetric theories was studied in @xcite , and for anomaly free supergravity theories in @xcite .",
    "whilst the models are stable in the presence of just a maxwell gauge group , for yang - mills theories a tachyonic instability is generically found in the scalars descending from the gauge fields and charged under the @xmath8 monopole background @xcite .",
    "for example , it turns out that only one of the anomaly free models presented in table [ anomalyfree ] has a stable sphere compactification if the @xmath8 monopole is embedded in a non - abelian factor of the gauge group : the @xmath9 model with the monopole embedded in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    ".some examples of anomaly free models with gauge groups containing @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there are also many other models , including _",
    "e.g. _ one with just an abelian @xmath7 gauge group , and the anomalies cancelled by 245 neutral hypermultiplets @xcite .",
    "[ anomalyfree ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     our main focus in the present work is then on the scalar perturbations of the gauge fields charged under the @xmath8 monopole background , as possible sources of instability .",
    "we analytically solve the linearized dynamics of these fields , and in particular derive their full kaluza - klein mass spectra . in this way we are able to identify some conditions for stability , and we observe the previous behaviour as well as some surprises .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .",
    "conical - ggp solutions which incorporate only positive tension brane sources are stable only for very special matter contents and monopole embeddings . specifically , the stability criteria observed in the sphere limit persists for these more general solutions .",
    "the sphere s stability criteria is also sufficient to ensure stability for conical - ggp solutions in the presence of negative tensions ( placed on orbifold fixed points ) .",
    "however , remarkably , we find that negative tension branes can relax these conditions , and render unstable sphere compactifications stable .",
    "let us end with an overview of the paper . in section [ s : theory",
    "] we briefly review the theory and its warped , axially symmetric brane world solutions .",
    "we also discuss some physical aspects of the background , in particular emphasising that the geometry induced by the backreaction of negative tension branes is well - defined .",
    "then , in section [ s : scalars ] we classify all the scalar perturbations present in the model and identify how the various sectors decouple .",
    "we argue that possible tachyonic instabilities should lie in the scalar fluctuations of the gauge fields orthogonal to the background monopole in the lie algebra of the gauge group .",
    "therefore , we turn in section [ s : oursector ] to the kaluza - klein mass spectra of these fields , and dedicate section [ s : stability ] to the consequences of these spectra for the stability .",
    "we end with some conclusions , and leave for the appendices some details on the algebra .",
    "in order to fix our conventions , we begin by reviewing the 6d chiral gauged supergravity and brane world solutions that interest us . then , in the following subsection , we will collect some details about the background geometry and topology which will later prove to be important .",
    "we consider 6d supergravity with a general matter content , whose gauge group @xmath12 is a product of simple groups that include a @xmath7 gauged r - symmetry .",
    "for example we could take the anomaly free group @xmath13 , under which the hyperinos are charged as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the bosonic action takes the form , and define @xmath15 . the index @xmath16 runs over @xmath17 . for fermionic terms",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite s_b & = & d^6 x , [ sb ] where @xmath18 represents the 6d planck scale and @xmath19 is the gauge coupling constant , which in fact represents a collection of independent gauge couplings including that of the @xmath7 subgroup , @xmath20 .",
    "the field @xmath21 is the dilaton , @xmath22 is the field strength of the gauge field , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the kalb - ramond field strength , which contains a chern - simons coupling as follows , with @xmath25 the structure constants of @xmath26 .",
    "the index @xmath27 runs over the full lie algebra of @xmath26 , and later we will use @xmath28 to label those directions orthogonal to that of the @xmath8 monopole . ] : h_mnp = _ m b_np + tr + perms .",
    "metric @xmath29 is on the target manifold of the hyperscalars , and here the index @xmath30 runs over all the hyperscalars .",
    "the dependence of the scalar potential on @xmath31 is such that its minimum is at @xmath32 , where it takes a positive - definite value , @xmath33 , due to the r - symmetry gauging @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the equations of motion that follow from ( [ sb ] ) .",
    "a general class of configurations with 4d poincar symmetry and axial symmetry in the transverse dimensions , is : & & ds^2=g_mndx^m dx^n = e^a()_dx^dx^+d^2+e^b()d^2 , + & & = _ ( ) q d , = ( ) , + & & h_mnp = 0 , ^ = 0 , [ axisymmetric ] with @xmath34 and @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a generator of a @xmath8 subgroup of a simple factor of @xmath12 , satisfying @xmath38 .    in the following",
    "we shall also use the radial coordinate defined by ( ) _ 0^d e^-a()/2 , [ theta]whose range is @xmath39 . in this frame the metric reads ds^2=e^a()(_dx^dx^+d^2 ) + e^b()d^2 .    given the above ansatz , the general solution has been found by ggp @xcite . we will focus on a subset of this general solution , namely that which contains singularities no worse than conical .",
    "the explicit conical - ggp solution is related to the coordinate @xmath40 in @xcite by @xmath41 . ]",
    "is then @xcite : e^a&=&e^/2= , e^b=^2 e^a , + & = & - q d,[ggpsolution]where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are generic real numbers . also , f_01+^2 ( ) , f_1 1+^2 ( ) , [ ggpsolution2]with @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the conical - ggp configuration is , however , a solution to the equations of motion only outside the points @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "this is because as @xmath48 or @xmath49 , the metric tends to that of a cone , with respective deficit angles = 2(1-|| ) = 2(1-|| ) , [ deltadeltabar]and corresponding delta - function behaviours in the ricci scalar .",
    "note that @xmath43 appears in the deficit angles only through its modulus , since the metric ( [ ggpsolution ] ) depends only on the square of @xmath43 , and so is insensitive to its sign .",
    "in order to promote the solution to a global one , we introduce two 3-brane sources into the system , each with action : [ braneaction ] s_b = -t d^4y , where @xmath50 are the brane embedding fields , @xmath51 are the worldvolume coordinates , @xmath52 and the tensions are respectively @xcite t=2/^2 t=2/^2.[tdelta]in this way we arrive at a warped codimension - two brane world construction , in which the 3-branes can localize bulk fields @xcite and/or support 4d fields in such a way as to realize the standard model of particle physics .    finally , we note that one can obtain the `` rugby ball '' compactification @xcite simply by setting @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the background value of the dilaton is zero , and therefore the stability analysis that we are going to present will also be applicable to the rugby ball solution of non - supersymmetric 6d einstein - yang - mills models .",
    "moreover , we can smoothly retrieve the sphere compactification by taking @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we continue our discussion on the background configuration by considering in more detail its geometry .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to note that the parameters appearing in the deficit angles , @xmath43 and @xmath56 , are not fixed by the eom but rather represent moduli .",
    "however , from ( [ deltadeltabar ] ) , we can see that the deficit angles are both bounded from above by @xmath57 .",
    "this becomes an upper bound on the brane tensions that can be described by the conical - ggp solution , because of the matching conditions in ( [ tdelta ] ) .",
    "meanwhile it is also clear that the deficit angles can take arbitrary large negative values .",
    "we emphasise here that manifolds with negative deficit angles are perfectly well defined , and can even be made at home with a piece of paper and a pair of scissors .",
    "take for example the simplest case of a cone . a cone with positive deficit angle",
    "is obtained by splicing a wedge out of a flat disk and glueing together the edges .",
    "similarly , a cone with negative deficit angle is obtained by splicing a wedge _ into _ a flat disk .",
    "the result will be a manifold which is flat everywhere apart from at the apex of the cone .",
    "lines that were parallel on the disk remain parallel until they pass on either side of the apex , after which they will begin to diverge , just as for the standard cone they would converge ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) .",
    "moreover , there is no lower bound on the deficit angle . for example , one could imagine adding @xmath58 wedges successively to the flat disk _",
    "ad infinitum_.    discretized versions of manifolds with negative deficit angles can be found in the solid - state literature on carbon nanostructures , in which nanocones with negative disclination angles are appropriately named `` saddle - cones '' @xcite .",
    "these provide another nice way to visualize the geometries , including those with , say , deficit angle less than @xmath59 . referring to figure [ fig : nanocone ]",
    ", we observe that beginning with a flat planar lattice of regular hexagons , and splicing in a wedge of @xmath58 , one ends with another lattice of hexagons , now taking the form of a ( flat ) saddle , and with the central hexagon replaced by a heptagon .",
    "a deficit angle of @xmath60 would correspond to a central enneagon , one of @xmath59 to a dodecagon , and so on .    on the other hand",
    ", we should note from eq .",
    "( [ tdelta ] ) that in our scenario the negative deficit angles are sourced by negative tension branes .",
    "it is well known that negative tension branes generically suffer from classical and quantum instabilities @xcite .",
    "we will return to this issue in the following section .",
    "having understood the geometry of the model , we must also take care of its topology .",
    "the euler number of the internal manifold is two , indicating the topology of a sphere .",
    "this can be seen from direct calculation , as well as by showing that the manifold can be covered by two holomorphic coordinate patches , which are related at the intersection by @xmath61 ( see below ) .",
    "we must therefore take care to ensure that the gauge field background is well - defined as @xmath48 and @xmath49 . indeed",
    "the expression for the gauge field background in eq .",
    "( [ ggpsolution ] ) is well - defined in the limit @xmath62 , but not as @xmath63 .",
    "we must therefore use a different patch to describe the @xmath64 limit , and in the overlap this must be related to the patch including @xmath65 by a single - valued gauge transformation .",
    "this leads to a dirac quantization condition , which for a field interacting with @xmath66 through a charge @xmath67 gives -e = -e = n , [ diracq]where @xmath68 is an integer that is called monopole number and @xmath69 is the gauge coupling constant corresponding to the background gauge field .",
    "for example , if @xmath70 lies in @xmath7 , then @xmath71 .",
    "generally different fields have different charges @xmath72 , which correspond to several monopole numbers @xmath73 ; as we shall see this aspect is important in the stability analysis of the conical - ggp solutions .",
    "the charges @xmath72 can be computed once we have selected the gauge group , since they are eigenvalues of the generator @xmath37 .",
    "as has long and often been noted , the dirac quantization leads to a constraint , relating the tensions of the two 3-branes which can be described by the conical - ggp solution and the bulk gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "for example , embedding the monopole in the @xmath7 gauge sector requires the presence of at least one negative tension brane @xcite .",
    "we now consider scalar fluctuations about the brane world solution , with the aim of studying its stability .",
    "the bulk perturbations which are scalars from the brane point of view can be written as : \\ { g_^ , g _ , g _ , g _",
    ", , , b _ , _ , _ , } . [ perts ] here , @xmath74 is the four - dimensional dual of the fluctuation in the kalb - ramond field @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the presence of branes introduces additional dynamical degrees of freedom , which are the brane - bending modes corresponding to fluctuations in their position in six - dimensional spacetime : \\{y^m } .",
    "let us now discuss these various fluctuations in turn .",
    "we begin by making some general comments . by choosing the so - called static gauge for the worldvolume",
    "coordinates , @xmath76 , we see that each brane carries two physical fields which correspond to their bending in the transverse dimensions : \\{y^(x ) , y^(x ) } . notice that the fields are four dimensional , and so do not lead to a kaluza - klein tower .",
    "the case of the unwarped rugby ball is , at least in part , simple .",
    "two of the fields parametrise the motion that keeps the branes at antipodal points of the sphere , and preserves the axial symmetry of the background",
    ". they must be massless modes .",
    "indeed , since the branes break the @xmath77 isometry group of the sphere down to the @xmath8 axial symmetry , these fields provide the massless goldstone bosons to be eaten by two of the @xmath77 massless graviphotons .",
    "less can be said about the remaining two brane bending fields , which describe the relative motion of the branes and which break the axial symmetry .",
    "the warped model may also be more complicated , since there the @xmath77 isometry of the sphere is broken not only by the brane defects but also by the geometry away from the branes .",
    "in general we can expect the brane bending modes to mix with the bulk metric fluctuations at the bilinear level .",
    "moreover , it is well known that negative tension branes generically have ghost kinetic terms for their bending modes , and thus lead to energies unbounded from below and instability . for these reasons",
    "we choose to place the branes at orbifold fixed points in such a way that they are not free to fluctuate .",
    "to find an orbifold projection that serves this purpose , we need a global description of the internal manifold , and in particular one in which both the brane positions can be well described . to this end , we cover the manifold with two coordinate patches .",
    "first we define the complex coordinates @xmath78 , with : z = e^i = e^__0^ e^-b/2 for some arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "the metric on the internal manifold becomes : ds^2 = d^2 + e^b d^2 = ( dz d|z ) . using the behaviour of @xmath80 as @xmath81 ( @xmath82 )",
    ", one can show that the brane at @xmath83 is now well described by the single point @xmath84 .",
    "meanwhile , in analogy with standard stereographic coordinates , the point @xmath85 can not be covered by @xmath86 .",
    "we therefore use a different coordinate patch to describe the brane there , defined by @xmath87 with : = e^-i . in this patch",
    "the brane at @xmath85 is well - defined at @xmath88 , and it is the brane at @xmath83 which is not covered . in the overlap ,",
    "the two coordinate systems are related by @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "notice that this confirms that the internal space is conformally @xmath91 .",
    "now one can immediately see that the brane positions are the fixed points under the orbifold identification z -z , -the brane fluctuations , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , being odd under the orbifold action , are thus projected out .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the hyperscalars do not mix with the other sectors at the level of the bilinear action .",
    "moreover , we can quite directly conclude they can not give rise to tachyonic instabilities : this is a consequence of the fact that the potential @xmath94 has a global minimum at @xmath95 , and also that the metric @xmath29 is positive definite . therefore , the contributions from the 6d potential and the 2d laplacian to the mass - squareds in the kaluza - klein mass spectrum are both positive .",
    "the scalar fluctuations descending from the gauge fields can be divided into two separate classes .",
    "first there are the fluctuations : \\ { _ q , _ q } , [ || ] with the gauge group generator @xmath37 corresponding to that of the background monopole .",
    "these will be included in the discussion of the following subsection .",
    "second , there are the fluctuations \\{_^i t^i , _ ^i t^i},[oursector]with @xmath96 being the generators orthogonal to @xmath37 , that is @xmath97 . at the bilinear level the second group does not mix with the first , and nor with any of the other sectors in ( [ perts ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the form of the action ( [ sb ] ) and that of the kalb - ramond field strength ( [ hkr ] ) .",
    "we will therefore return to the fields ( [ oursector ] ) , which are the main focus in the present paper , in section [ s : oursector ] .",
    "the possible instabilities are generally lurking in this sector .",
    "the remaining fields are those which also correspond to the minimal salam - sezgin model , that is with just one @xmath7 gauge multiplet : \\ { g_^ , g _ , g _ , g _ , , , b _ , _ q , _ q } .",
    "[ cliffsector ] let us here recall the long - known result that the salam - sezgin sphere model is marginally stable , with two and only two massless scalar modes , and a kaluza - klein tower of heavy positive mass - squared modes @xcite .",
    "one of the massless modes corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of the global classical scaling symmetry and @xmath98 . note that this is only a classical symmetry because the action rescales as @xmath99 . ] .",
    "the other is guaranteed by the unbroken kalb - ramond gauge symmetry , where @xmath100 is the two - form with components @xmath101 , and @xmath102 a one - form gauge parameter .",
    "then the components @xmath103 are dual to a massless 4d scalar .",
    "meanwhile , the directions @xmath104 provide the goldstone boson that is to be eaten by the massive @xmath8 gauge field in the direction of the monopole . ] . since the massless modes are protected by symmetry arguments , we can argue that small deformations of the sphere solution to the conical - ggp solution must remain marginally stable .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite analysed explicitly a subsector of ( [ cliffsector ] ) , namely the axially - symmetric perturbations corresponding to those members that are even under a certain parity symmetry . by imposing that the perturbations preserve the conical singularities ,",
    "a single massless mode was found , corresponding to the classical scaling symmetry enjoyed by the field equations .",
    "all other modes were shown to have positive squared - masses .",
    "we will now complete the stability analysis for brane world compactifications in anomaly free models , by considering the final sector @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , these fields are of particular interest .",
    "indeed , it has long been known that this sector  and only this sector",
    " can in general contain tachyonic modes in its kaluza - klein spectra for the sphere compactification with a monopole background @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask what happens to these tachyons if one considers the conical - ggp configuration , which as we have seen is a warped deformation of the sphere compactification .    as an example",
    ", we could consider the anomaly free model of @xmath106 , with the monopole embedded in @xmath10 . in this case , the low - energy gauge group is is promoted to @xmath107 . ]",
    ": @xmath108 , and the fluctuations covered by our analysis are two sets of scalars transforming under @xmath109 as @xmath110 , and in various representations of @xmath111 depending on the monopole number . in order to keep the analysis of the present sector as general as possible , we choose here not to impose the orbifold boundary conditions discussed above",
    ". these would of course only project out some of the modes in the full spectra derived below , and so would not introduce new instabilities .",
    "let us then consider the bilinear action for the fluctuations v _ & = & v_^i t^i ^i_t^i , + v _ & = & v_^i t^i ^i _",
    "t^i around the background ( [ axisymmetric ] ) . since @xmath96 is orthogonal to @xmath37 , the perturbed action simplifies considerably , having contributions only from the gauge kinetic term in ( [ sb ] )",
    "after fixing to the light - cone gauge ( see reference @xcite and appendix [ a : gaugefixing ] for details ) , the result can be written as ) the fluctuation fields @xmath112 have been normalized in a way that the canonical factor @xmath113 appears in front of the kinetic terms . ] : s_2(v , v ) & = & -12 d^6x tr [ b2action ] where we have introduced @xmath114 , and the indices @xmath115 run over @xmath116 . also for compactness",
    ", we have defined : & & a a + , b b + , /2 + & & g_mn dx^m dx^m e^a _ dx^ dx^ + dr^2 + e^b d^2 , and all indices are raised and lowered with the background metric @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 are the internal components of the ricci - tensor defined from the metric @xmath117 , and @xmath119 refers to the background field strength .",
    "moreover , recall that the covariant derivative in general includes the gauge field background .",
    "in particular , we have d _",
    "v_j = _ v_j - i a_[q , v_j ] with @xmath120 the lorentz covariant derivative .",
    "below we will choose a basis of generators such that : = e^i t^i , which means that in general they will not be hermitian .",
    "however , we choose the normalization @xmath121 , and also define @xmath122 = i f^{ijk } t^k$ ] . also , @xmath123 is the corresponding charge under the @xmath8 monopole .",
    "for example , for the @xmath124 model , we have @xmath125 for the @xmath126 and @xmath127 . the dirac quantization condition ( [ diracq ] ) then gives @xmath128 . in the following , we suppress the index @xmath28 .    finally , since our internal space is topologically @xmath129 , we shall impose that the fluctuations are periodic functions of @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the following fourier decomposition : v_j(x ) = _ m v_jm(x , r ) e^im [ fourier ] with @xmath131 an integer , @xmath132 .",
    "next we vary the above action with respect to @xmath133 and @xmath134 , perform the fourier decompositions ( [ fourier ] ) , and project onto the fourier number @xmath131 . after a long but standard calculation",
    "we eventually obtain the following coupled equations of motion : e^-a m_m^2 v_rm & = & -_r^2 v_rm- ( 2 _ r a + 12_r b ) _",
    "r v_rm + & & + v_rm + & & + i e^-b v_m [ eomvr ] and e^-a m_m^2 v_m & = & -_r^2 v_m - ( 2 _ ra - ) _ r v_m + e^-b ( m- ea _ ) ^2 v_m + & & - i v_r m , [ eomvvarphi ] where @xmath135 are the eigenvalues of @xmath136 .    at the same time , the variation leads to the following boundary conditions @xcite : d^4x dr _",
    "r = 0 [ hcr ] and d^4x dr _ r = 0 [ hcvarphi ] where we used @xmath137 .",
    "notice that these are the weakest boundary conditions possible , which we must apply in order for the field equations to make sense mathematically . in principle , with some physical motivation",
    ", we could apply stronger boundary conditions .",
    "however , for the purposes of the stability analysis , since stronger boundary conditions would only eliminate modes from the physical spectrum , we prefer to remain as general as possible .",
    "our objective is then to solve these coupled linearized equations , together with their boundary conditions , in order to deduce the behaviour of the perturbations .",
    "we proceed by transforming the system into a pair of coupled schroedinger equations plus boundary conditions .",
    "this is achieved by introducing the coordinate @xmath138 , defined in ( [ theta ] ) , and the new variables : v_1m(x , ) & & e^a/4 + b/4 v_m(x , ) , + v_2m(x , ) & & e^3a/4 - b/4 v_m(x , ) .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eomvr ] ) and ( [ eomvvarphi ] ) then become : m^2 v_1 & = & -v_1  + v_1 + & & + i e^a/2 - b/2 v_2 and m^2 v_2 & = & -v_2  + v_2 + & & - i e^a/2 - b/2 v_1 , where @xmath139 and we have suppressed the index @xmath131 . in other words , the system can then be described in the following way : ( -_^2 + u_1 ( ) & i c ( ) + -i c ( ) & -_^2 + u_2 ( ) ) ( v_1(x , ) + v_2(x , ) ) = m^2 ( v_1(x , ) + v_2(x , ) ) , [ coupledschro ] where the schroedinger potentials are given by u_1 & & , + u_2 & & , and the coupling function is c e^a/2 - b/2 .    at this stage",
    "we can observe that for the conical solution ( [ ggpsolution ] ) the two schroedinger potentials are degenerate : u_1 = u_2 u .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to diagonalize the system . indeed , transforming into the basis : v_(x , ) ( v_1(x , ) i v_2(x , ) ) [ + -basis ] the matrix equation ( [ coupledschro ] ) becomes : ( -_^2 + u ( ) + c ( ) & 0 + 0 & -_^2 + u()- c ( ) ) ( v_+(x , ) + v_-(x , ) ) = m^2 ( v_+(x , ) + v_-(x , ) ) .",
    "[ decoupledschro ]    having decoupled the equations , we should now consider the boundary conditions in terms of the new basis ( [ + -basis ] ) .",

    "recall that the results for @xmath151 are obtained by taking @xmath152 and @xmath181 . by using this information",
    "it is easy to see that a necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of tachyons in the sphere case is simply @xcite |n^i|1 i,[spherecondition]where we have restored the lie algebra index @xmath28 . to derive inequality ( [ spherecondition ] )",
    "one can use the fact that , in the sphere case , @xmath182 is an allowed value of @xmath172 for every @xmath131 , as can be checked by means of the definitions ( [ k1])-([kf ] ) .    in order to satisfy ( [ spherecondition ] )",
    "we must have that all the charges @xmath123 corresponding to our sector ( [ oursector ] ) assume just one value , up to their sign .",
    "moreover , we must have that the absolute value of all the charges in the hypermatter sector , @xmath183 , is not smaller than @xmath184 . these are consequences of the dirac quantization condition ( [ diracq ] ) .",
    "if we embed the background monopole in an abelian factor of @xmath12 , these conditions are obviously satisfied as @xmath185 , for all @xmath28 , in this case .",
    "however , for an embedding in a non - abelian factor of @xmath12 , these conditions select only one possibility amongst the anomaly free models presented in table [ anomalyfree ] : the @xmath9 model , with the monopole embedded in @xmath10 under which all hypermultiplets are singlets @xcite model with hyperino representation as follows : seven hyperinos transforming as a @xmath186 of @xmath77 , two as a @xmath187 and thirty - one as a @xmath188 @xcite . ] .",
    "our purpose is now to see whether or not condition ( [ spherecondition ] ) is valid also for the conical - ggp solutions . to this end",
    "one can analyze directly the explicit expressions for the spectrum given in ( [ m1])-([m4 ] ) and simply study the inequality @xmath189 for those four expressions , which are valid in four different ranges of @xmath131 . after a long but straightforward computation , the following results emerge . a sufficient condition for the absence of tachyons in the conical - ggp solution",
    "is constraint ( [ spherecondition ] ) .",
    "thus the warping and brane defects do not introduce new instabilities .",
    "meanwhile , when both the tensions are non - negative ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) , constraint ( [ spherecondition ] ) is also a necessary condition for the absence of tachyons . in this case",
    "we have exactly the same situation as in the sphere case , so positive tension branes have no effect on stability at all .",
    "however , when at least one tension is negative ( @xmath192 and/or @xmath193 ) , we can relax that constraint if the absolute value of a negative tension is large enough .",
    "the latter statement can be proved by analyzing the following special cases .",
    "( i ) : :    @xmath192 and @xmath194 , that is    @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "this    case corresponds to a solution with just one conical defect and a    non - trivial warping . here",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the    absence of tachyons is |n^i|1 + i.[i ] ( ii ) : :    @xmath197 , that is    @xmath198 .",
    "this set up corresponds to    the unwarped rugby ball compactification with negative deficit angles .    in this case",
    "a sufficient condition for the absence of tachyons is    |n^i| i.[ii ]    some details of the derivation of ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) are provided in appendix [ detailsstab ] .",
    "since @xmath199 appears in the denominator of ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) , it is clear that we can render stable an arbitrary large value of @xmath200 by choosing a small enough value of @xmath199 , that is by introducing a large negative tension brane .",
    "for example , if we want to stabilize the value @xmath201 , which is unstable in the sphere case , we have to choose a deficit angle @xmath202 in case ( [ i ] ) , and @xmath203 in case ( [ ii ] ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that the conical - ggp solution is a stable solution for all 6d gauged supergravities , if we allow arbitrarily negative brane tensions .",
    "however , if we require that there are only non - negative tensions , the stability of the system exactly selects the same models as in the sphere case ( with the additional topological constraint that the monopole can not be embedded in @xmath7  see the end of subsection [ s : geometry ] ) .",
    "we have studied the stability of axi - symmetric brane world compactifications ( conical - ggp solutions ) in anomaly free , chiral , gauged 6d supergravity .",
    "anomaly freedom is a central principle of quantum physics , and in six dimensional supergravity it places restrictions on the possible matter supermultiplets that can be present .",
    "indeed , this lack of arbitrariness can be considered as one of the theory s most attractive features .",
    "meanwhile , we remark that the central results of our work also apply to more general situations . for example , they are relevant for any 6d gauged supergravity ( anomalous or otherwise ) which has non - abelian gauge groups , and also for the yang - mills extensions to the non - supersymmetric models of @xcite .",
    "we began by considering the various types of bulk and brane scalar fluctuations that are present in the model , and in particular how they decouple at the bilinear level .",
    "we chose to project out the brane bending modes by placing the branes at orbifold fixed points .",
    "then , the salam - sezgin sector ( _ i.e. _ those scalars fluctuations descending from the supergravity - tensor multiplet and the @xmath8 gauge multiplet in the direction of the background monopole ) was considered for the axially - symmetric perturbations in @xcite , and no instabilities were found .",
    "the remaining sectors are then the hyperscalar fluctuations , and those scalar fluctuations of the gauge fields which are orthogonal to the monopole background in the lie algebra of @xmath169 .",
    "the hyperscalars fluctuations can immediately be seen to have positive squared - masses in the 4d effective theory .",
    "therefore , the main efforts in the present article were directed towards the scalar fluctuations of the said gauge fields , the sector which normally harbours instabilities .",
    "we used the light - cone gauge to derive the bilinear action for these fluctuations @xcite . in this way we obtained the linearized equations of motion , and found them to be a pair of coupled , second - order odes .",
    "we transformed them into a pair of schroedinger equations , and found that it is possible to decouple them .",
    "the problem then reduces to the same form as that treated in @xcite , and we analytically derived the full spectra . the exact results that we obtained enabled us to draw both expected and surprising results , with regards to the stability of the compactifications .",
    "as was observed long ago for the sphere - monopole compactification of these theories @xcite , in general we find a tachyonic instability in the scalar fluctuations of the gauge fields that are charged under the monopole background . in the case of the sphere , the necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of tachyons can be written as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 are the integer monopole numbers carried by each gauge field @xcite .",
    "if we embed the monopole background in an abelian factor of the gauge group , then the compactification is stable .",
    "however , if the monopole happens to lie in a non - abelian factor of the gauge group , then generically the compactification is unstable .",
    "for example , amongst the anomaly free models described in table [ anomalyfree ] , only one fulfills the necessary condition : the @xmath9 model with the monopole embedded in the hidden @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we find that the same condition holds for the conical - ggp solutions that contain positive tension branes only .",
    "it is also a sufficient condition for models which incorporate negative tension branes . in other words ,",
    "a ggp compactification is stable if its sphere limit is stable .",
    "furthermore , with positive tension branes only , a ggp compactification is unstable if its sphere limit is unstable .",
    "however , it becomes possible to relax the constraint by incorporating large , negative tensions .",
    "this seems remarkable , given that negative tension branes are usually associated with instabilities rather than stability .",
    "meanwhile , the simplest way to obtain a stable conical - ggp solution appears to be to embed the monopole in an abelian factor of the gauge group .",
    "notice that , at least for the most elegant anomaly free models such as those in table [ anomalyfree ] , there is typically only one abelian gauge factor available , which corresponds to the @xmath7 gauged r - symmetry .",
    "it is known , however , from the dirac quantization condition , that embedding the monopole in the @xmath7 again leads to the requirement of at least one negative tension brane @xcite !",
    "we should note , though , that there is actually a host of anomaly free models with extra drone @xmath8 s @xcite . for a stable model with only positive tension branes , therefore , we must turn to one of these or to one of the more `` miracolous '' models discussed at the end of subsection [ spherestability ] .    for these reasons ,",
    "we have also discussed in detail the geometry induced by negative tension branes .",
    "the associated negative deficit angles give rise to so - called _ saddle - cones_. as noted , the orbifolding projects out the brane - embedding fields , which are usually a source of instability for negative tension branes .",
    "we mention here that , furthermore , the orbifolding gives rise to a chiral spectrum for the bulk fermion zero modes .",
    "whilst models with positive tension branes give rise to a chiral spectrum even without the orbifold projection , those which include negative tension branes in general include zero modes of both chirality .",
    "this can be observed by considering the spectrum found in @xcite . in addition",
    "we note that the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite  that the kaluza - klein mass scale and that of the internal volume can decouple in the presence of conical defects  also holds for the present mass spectrum in the case of negative tension branes .    in summary ,",
    "we find that the conical - ggp solutions with positive tension branes are stable only for very limited classes of anomaly free theories and monopole embeddings . such models , therefore , as used for example in the supersymmetric large extra dimension scenario , are almost unique in character . meanwhile , somewhat surprisingly , negative tension branes seem to allow for stability in a much wider class of models .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to obtain some physical intuition as to how the negative tension branes render unstable sphere compactifications stable .    finally , given that the generic model is unstable , the big question is : where is the instability taking it to ? here we comment that since the tachyonic mass has its origin in the internal part of the 6d gauge kinetic term , which is semi - positive definite , we expect it to be stabilized at the quartic level .",
    "moreover , the tachyonic masses are found in non - axially symmetric modes , so we might ask : is there a stable non - axially symmetric brane world solution to 6d gauged supergravity ?    * acknowledgments .",

    "[ n+ ] the corresponding constraint for @xmath151 can be obtained by transforming @xmath214 in ( [ n+ ] ) ; this leads to @xmath225 , which , together with ( [ n+ ] ) , gives exactly ( [ i ] ) .",

    "<S> only , there is a strict stability criterion ( identical to the sphere case ) on the charges present under the monopole background . </S>",
    "<S> thus brane world models with positive tensions can be embedded into anomaly free theories in only a few ways . meanwhile , surprisingly , in the presence of a negative tension brane the stability criteria can be relaxed . </S>",
