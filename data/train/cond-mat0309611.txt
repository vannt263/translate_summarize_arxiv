    "the propagation of an electron beam in a two - dimensional degenerate electron gas ( 2deg ) can be used to study the role of electron - electron ( e - e ) collisions in reduced dimensions , see e.g. refs .",
    "of main interest are `` high - energy '' beams with a typical electron energy that exceeds considerably the thermal energy of the equilibrium electrons within the 2deg , but remains significantly below the fermi energy .",
    "a special combination of ac- and dc - measurement techniques allows for an energy selective investigation of electrons traversing a defined distance within a 2deg @xcite .",
    "some of these experiments were analyzed in terms of the @xmath0-approximation @xcite , where it is supposed that each collision scatters an electron out of the beam .",
    "however , this approach is obviously insufficient for the case of electron - electron ( ee ) scattering in a 2deg , where small angle scattering events dominate , and scattered electrons may remain within the region of the electron beam @xcite .    for an adequate theoretical description of ee - scattering",
    "it is necessary to take into account the incoming terms in the collision operator @xmath1 ( see the second term on the right of the equation for @xmath1 ) of the dynamic integro - differential linearized boltzmann equation :    @xmath2    here , @xmath3 is the distribution function of non - equilibrium electrons , @xmath4 determines the location of a non - equilibrium electron , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron velocity and momentum , respectively ( quasi - classical approximation ) .",
    "@xmath7 is the lorentz force acting on the electron .",
    "the function @xmath8 determines the probability of non - equilibrium electrons ( @xmath9 ) or holes ( @xmath10 ) to be found in state @xmath6 after scattering from state @xmath11 .",
    "a hole in this case describes the absence of an equilibrium electron below the fermi surface .        in the general case ,",
    "the solution of the kinetic boltzmann equation ( [ e - kin ] ) is a very difficult task , both in analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "but it is well known from the kinetics of gases that two regimes exist which allow for an essential simplification of the description .",
    "first , in the few - collision case the probability is small for an electron to be scattered over a characteristic length scale @xmath12 ( e.g. , the distance between the injector to the detector , see fig.[g - exp ] below ) , which is much smaller than the electron - electron mean - free path , @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , using perturbation theory it is possible to solve the boltzmann equation by iteration of the collision operator ( quasiballistic approximation ) .",
    "second , in the case of frequent collisions ( @xmath15 ) a hydrodynamic situation arises .",
    "the influence of frequent collisions establishes a quasi - equilibrium distribution which is characterized by hydrodynamic variables , such as the average velocity or temperature which depend only smoothly on @xmath4 .",
    "these regimes were studied in our previous publications @xcite . for obvious reasons",
    "a treatment of the intermediate regime ( @xmath16 ) presents considerable difficulties .    in this paper",
    "we show that it is possible to study the intermediate regime successfully if the scattering probability decreases substantially with each collision .",
    "the occurrence of a decreasing scattering probability can be expressed by an additional small parameter @xmath17 which is defined as the ratio of the scattering probability of a nonequilibrium electron after a collision to the probability before this event .",
    "such situations can be found in a wide range of problems where non - equilibrium quasi - particles exhibiting some excess energy , above thermal equilibrium , collide with equilibrium quasi - particles and lose a considerable amount of this energy due to this event .",
    "usually , the probability for inelastic scattering decreases drastically with decreasing energy of the quasi - particles , because the statistical weight decreases for both the possibility for finding a collision partner and for finding empty final states .",
    "electron - electron , electron - phonon or phonon - phonon collisions at temperatures below the debye temperature can be taken as an example .",
    "our approach is based on the following concept : ( i ) a few collisions are treated exactly , while ( ii ) subsequent collisions are neglected , or considered perturbationally .",
    "we will refer to this approach as the `` modified one - collision approximation '' ( moc ) , which accounts for the fact that in most cases a restriction to an one collision approximation is sufficient to explain the general features of the scattering experiments . in the present work ,",
    "a full account of the moc approximation is given and the results are applied to analyze experimental data obtained from electron beam experiments .",
    "it is shown , that applicability of the moc approximation to the scattering of high - energy electrons substantially extends the description of spectroscopic data from electron - electron collisions experiments @xcite .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence of the signal of scattered electrons on the beam energy can be explained within the moc approximation .",
    "this observation can be interpreted as a crossover from the ballistic to multi - collision ( hydrodynamic ) flow regime .",
    "let us consider non - equilibrium electrons at a characteristic energy @xmath18 , measured from the fermi level @xmath19 , and larger than the temperature @xmath20 of the equilibrium electron gas , @xmath21 .",
    "in a first stage of relaxation these highly non - equilibrium electrons are scattered by equilibrium electrons thus generating a new non - equilibrium system but with already much lower excess energy .",
    "this stage of relaxation was named the `` pretemperature '' stage in ref.@xcite .",
    "this `` pretemperature '' stage ends when the quasi - particles energy becomes comparable to the bath temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the most important fact for the `` pretemperature '' stage is the following : if the energy @xmath22 , then the probability of secondary collision is an order of magnitude lower than for the first one @xcite .",
    "indeed , the energy @xmath23 of a non - equilibrium electron after collision with an equilibrium electron will be distributed between three states in phase space :    @xmath24 @xmath25    for @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 due to pauli principle , i.e. the state @xmath11 is below the fermi level while the final states @xmath29 and @xmath30 are well above .",
    "the energy of the initial electron is redistributed between three final states . on average ,",
    "the energy of each state after the first collision can be expressed as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 ( note , the numerical value of @xmath33 depends on the specific type of problem considered)@xcite . since the energy dependent mean - free path @xmath34 , this means that @xmath35 of non - equilibrium quasi - particles will increase by about an order of magnitude , which implies that @xmath36 .",
    "this may lead to a situation where the probability for a secondary collision is low while the probability for the first collision is close to unity in a system of size @xmath12 : @xmath37 . in this case , it is a natural choice to consider the first collision exactly while the secondary collision is treated by perturbation theory , which leads to an extension of the validity of the one - collision approximation up to @xmath38 .    in the following , we use this approach for the case of propagation of nonequilibrium electrons in an electron beam injected into a 2deg via a quantum point - contact . for steady state conditions , the operator @xmath39 on the left side of eq .",

    "the quasi - particles , which appear as the result of a collision , are described by the action of the incoming part @xmath55 of the collision operator @xmath56 on @xmath57 . in other words , @xmath58 correspond to a particle that has been scattered once , while @xmath59 describes a subsequent second scattering event , and so forth .",
    "correspondingly , the typical energies of these states differ : @xmath60 is characterized by the energy @xmath54 , for @xmath58 the characteristic energy will be @xmath61 and for @xmath62 it will be given by @xmath63 etc .",

    "[ g - exp ] , excludes solutions with a full cyclotron orbit .",
    "note that the moc approximation is applicable in principle under conditions , where a pre - temperature stage occurs for the non - equilibrium quasi - particles .",

    "if @xmath12 corresponds to the @xmath50-th segment of this hierarchy , i.e. @xmath87 , it is necessary to construct a `` moc-@xmath50 '' approximation by treating the first @xmath50 collisions exactly ; which leads to relative corrections of the order of @xmath88 .",

    "thus , just a few steps lead to a high accuracy .",
    "it turns out , that for the experiments discussed below , just one step is enough to produce satisfactory results .",
    "in order to investigate the electron - electron scattering properties in a 2deg , experiments are needed which allow to distinguish between scattered and non - scattered particles , and reveal the details of scattered signal .",

    "the presence of a maximum and the subsequent decrease in the energy dependence of @xmath132 can not be explained in the context of a simple perturbation theory applied to the collision integral , because in the regime where the maximum is observed the electron - electron mean - free path is already smaller than the distance between the injector and detector qpc .",
    "perturbation theory can only be applied to describe the increase of the signal for small energies @xmath101 .",
    "the presence of a strong decrease appears at first sight to be unexpected , because in the multi - collision regime that is entered upon increasing @xmath101 , a decrease of the ac - signal from scattered particles is not anticipated . in this multi - collision regime",

    "[ g - vsmx ] can be explained in the context of the modified one - collisional approximation described above by taking into account the specific properties of e - e scattering in two - dimensions @xcite .",

( [ e - moca ] ) leads to the following expression for the detector signal due to scattered particles    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is the scattering angle and @xmath135 is the angular distribution function of e - e scattering , @xmath136 , averaged over an interval @xmath137 ; the weighting coefficient @xmath138 is @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "( it is sufficient to consider only the case where the cyclotron radius @xmath119 is smaller than @xmath12 . )",
    "it should be noted that eq .",

    "( [ e - specform ] ) represents the length of the electron trajectory from the injector to the point @xmath145 where the scattering takes place ( see  fig .  [ g - exp ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ e - specform ] ) it follows , that the signal due to scattered particles is directly proportional , on the one hand , to the e - e scattering probability , or the frequency of the collisions @xmath68 and , on the other hand , it is proportional to the probability of an electron to reach the scattering point @xmath145 ballistically .",
    "as has been shown earlier in @xcite , the pre - exponential factor increases with increasing @xmath101 at low injection energies ( mainly due to the increase of the collision frequency @xmath146 ) .    the existence of a maximum in fig .",
    "[ g - vsmx ] can be attributed to a competition between an increase of the scattering probability ( the pre - exponential factor ) and a decrease of ballistic transport into the neighborhood of the scattering point @xmath145 ( the exponent ) with @xmath101 .",
    "this explanation is supported by the excellent quantitative agreement between the experimental data and a theoretical fit based on eq .",
    "( [ e - specform ] ) , where the angle @xmath134 is replaced by the experimental value @xmath147 , see fig .",
    "[ g - vsmx ] .",
    "the good fit also justifies the use of the one - collision moc approximations indicating that higher orders collisions can be neglected . for small energies ,",
    "the pre - exponential factor determines the behaviour of the signal due to scattered particles , which also can be described by standard perturbation theory applied to the collisions integral . around the maximum",
    "the probability for secondary collisions is still small and the signal is still defined by the scattering that takes place in the neighborhood of the point @xmath145 - however , the probability for a first collision on the way between the injector and the detector becomes larger .",
    "this underlines the decrease of the signal with increasing @xmath101 . as mentioned above this regime",
    "can not be described by ordinary perturbation theory , requing the moc approximation . at this point",
    "we would like to note that the non - monotonic behavior of the ac - current component which has been discussed above can not be explained by nonlinearities due to heating effects which are expected to appear at approximately the same values of @xmath101 in dc - measurements @xcite .",
    "it can be shown , that such an effect gives only a small correction of the order of @xmath148 to the ac - component of the signal , where @xmath149 is the temperature due to the heating effect .    finally , we may only speculate about the origin of the weak increase of the detector signal which is observed for the highest injection energies @xmath101 . as the injection energy approaches @xmath150 , the potential drop across the injector qpc becomes so large that the second subband of the qpc may become populated .",
    "this enhances the injector conductance , and , consequently , the detected signal . for these energies",
    "( [ e - specform ] ) is no longer valid ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a second reason could be transition to the two - collision ( or multi - collision ) regime as the mean - free path is less then @xmath151 at these energies .",
    "in summary , we have shown in this paper that it is possible to successfully investigate the evolution of a high - energy non - equilibrium quasi - particles distribution with the help of the `` modified one - collision approximation '' .",
    "this method was used to explain novel measurements of the non - monotonic energy dependence of the signal of scattered electrons in a 2d system .",
    "we have obtained an excellent quantitative agreement between the experimental data and a theoretical calculation .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to emphasize that the moc approximation may be of interest for a wide range of problems independent of the nature of the scattering particles ; the only restriction is that the scattering probability should strongly decrease after one or several collisions .",
    "along with the case of electron - electron scattering , this is a typical situation for the majority of inelastic scattering processes , such as electron - phonon , phonon - phonon etc .",
    "let us discuss as an example , electron - phonon scattering in the case when the electron energy is high enough @xmath152 , but is low in comparison with the debye temperature ( the electron energy is measured from the fermi level ) . in this case",
    "a phonon with an energy of the order of @xmath23 will be emitted as a result of the electron - phonon scattering event and the corresponding mean - free path is @xmath153 .",
    "in contrast to electron - electron scattering the energy is redistributed here between two states according to the momentum and energy conservation laws , @xmath154 and @xmath155 . here",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath157 are the quasimomentum and energy before the collision , and after the collision they are @xmath158 , and @xmath157 , respectively ; @xmath159 is quasimomentum of the emitted phonon and @xmath160 its energy .",
    "since , on average , the energy is redistributed equally between the scattering product @xmath161 , we also have here the small parameter @xmath162 .",
    "the case of three - particles high - energy phonon - phonon scattering processes differs only by the energy dependence of the mean - free path .",
    "furthermore , the inelasticity , on which the approach developed in this paper is based , is likely to be relevant not only to the energy redistribution but also to some other quantities ; this includes , for example , the spin in cases where the probability of scattering decreases significantly after a spin - flip scattering event .",
    "this case may be realized for electron scattering from spin - polarized impurities ( there are no spin subbands in this case ) and if the exchange interaction depends significantly on the mutual orientation of the electron spin and the impurity spin .",
    "let us neglect the interaction between electrons of one of the spin directions ( spin - up , for example ) and the impurities .",
    "then the spin relaxation process is completed just after the first spin - flip scattering of the spin - down electrons .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to describe this process in the framework of the modified one - collision approximation .",
    "the method we proposed in this work can be very effective also for point - contact spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic of the electric circuit containing a microconstriction is determined by the back - scattering due to inelastic electron scattering processes just in the region of the microconstriction .",
    "if @xmath163 ( l is the length of the constriction ) the current - voltage characteristic is determined only by one , or few , first collisions , the probability of which is not small and , thus , it can not be taken into account using a perturbation theory ( as it was done in the study described in ref.@xcite for the case when @xmath164 ) .",
    "the same also holds for the nonlinear thermoelectric phenomenon in point - contacts @xcite .",
    "the influence of the first collisions on the point - contact spectrum may be calculated exactly using equations of the general form of eq.(6 ) because in point - contact spectroscopy the excess energy of the electron is high , @xmath152 .",
