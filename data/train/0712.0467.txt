    "a century after einstein  @xcite and smoluchowski  @xcite seminal contributions , brownian motion ( bm ) and diffusion phenomena remain an active subject of research .",
    "statistical mechanics , since its foundation , has been operating an elegant synthesis between the microscopic dynamical laws and the macroscopic properties of a system . in this context ,",
    "brownian motion is a paradigmatic example of this _",
    "modus operandi_.    in the statistical mechanics framework , the minimal condition needed by microscopic dynamics for macroscopic diffusion can be identified in the presence of a mechanism leading to velocity decorrelation  memory loss . in the effort of interpreting bm and non - equilibrium transport in the light of modern dynamical systems theory",
    ", it thus comes rather natural to identify in the chaotic character of microscopic dynamics the main candidate to explain macroscopic transport .",
    "the instabilities of chaotic evolutions typically produce irregular trajectories resembling brownian motions and supply a simple mechanism for memory loss . indeed large scale diffusion has been found in simple low dimensional chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "this picture received theoretical support from the existence , in some systems , of remarkable quantitative relations between macroscopic transport coefficients  such as diffusivity , thermal and electrical conductivity  , and microscopic chaos indicators  such as the lyapunov exponents and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy  , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , non - chaotic models generating diffusion have been proposed  @xcite raising some doubts on the actual role of chaos for diffusion .",
    "however , these models , representing possibly the most elementary examples of diffusion without chaos , seem to be rather artificial : involve few degrees of freedom , often the presence of quenched randomness is needed together with the fine tuning of some parameters , e.g. , for the suppression of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "their relevance to statistical mechanics is thus not obvious .",
    "it is worth remarking that questions about the relevance of chaos have been recently raised also in the ( related ) context of thermal conduction problems  @xcite , where non - chaotic models for heat transport were proposed and investigated @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that the above systems are non - chaotic in the sense that the lyapunov spectrum is non - positive .",
    "however , there are well known examples of lyapunov stable systems that display non trivial behaviours  @xcite . in the presence of dynamical randomness without the sensitivity to initial condition , as in quantum mechanics , an alternative definition of `` chaos '' or `` randomness '' has been proposed in terms of the positiveness of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite . in classical systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , as consequence of the pesin s formula , the two definitions coincide . however , the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is an interesting open possibility for quantum and classical systems in the limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is far from trivial to the establish the role of chaos to macroscopic transport properties .",
    "the problem is actually more general as chaos ( in the above wider definition ) had been often invoked to justify the whole statistical mechanics apparatus @xcite and to explain the irreversibility of macroscopic processes @xcite .",
    "such viewpoint coexists with the `` more traditional '' approach of boltzmann , which stresses the role of the many degrees of freedom and is mathematically supported by the results of khinchin  @xcite , mazur and van der linden  @xcite ( see also bricmont  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this paper aims to discuss the role of chaos in the context of diffusion , thus we compare a chaotic and a non - chaotic many degrees of freedom system , providing two distinct deterministic models for bm . both models consist of rarefied gas of hard particles surrounding a larger and heavier particle , in the following referred to as colloidal particle ( or colloid for brevity ) , impurity or test particle . as an effect of the large number of collisions , the deterministic motion of such an impurity behaves",
    "as a bm at long times ( i.e. much larger than the collision time ) provided its mass is much larger than that of the lighter gas particles .",
    "the latter condition ensures a scale separation between the gas and impurity dynamics .",
    "the asymptotic convergence to a bm was proved for an infinite one dimensional system of hard - core particles  @xcite and , later , in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the first model consists of @xmath0 hard disks surrounding a larger and heavier disk as sketched in fig .  1 ( left ) .",
    "particle interactions occur via binary elastic , hard - core collisions which , due to convex shape of the disk , lead to chaotic trajectories ( i.e. exponential separation among initially close trajectories ) . in the following , this hard disk model will be denoted by the acronym hd .    the second model , illustrated in fig .  1 ( right ) , consists of a gas of @xmath0 hard ( non - rotating ) parallel squares ( hps ) surrounding a larger and heavier square particle . in this case ,",
    "binary hard - core elastic collisions are not central and conserve the initial parallel orientation of the squares .",
    "unlike hd , the resulting dynamics is non - chaotic .",
    "this model is not new , the case of a hps gas with identical particles ( without the impurity ) has been studied both in terms of molecular dynamics and kinetic theory by frisch and coworkers @xcite .",
    "it constitutes an interesting statistical mechanics system characterized by the presence of an infinite number of integrals of motion , preventing the system from being ergodic .",
    "remarkably , in spite of such a pathology , the hps gas gives rise to , e.g. , phase transitions and transport properties as in the hd gas which , on the contrary , possesses ergodic and mixing properties .",
    "the colloid can be seen as a test particle to probe the transport properties of both hps and hd . notwithstanding",
    "the intrinsic difference in their dynamics , chaotic for hd and non - chaotic for hps , their macroscopic diffusion properties are remarkably similar , as confirmed by the analysis of the velocity - velocity correlations , connected to diffusion via the green - kubo formula  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the response function of the velocity of the colloid and of gas particles to small perturbations confirm that the non - chaotic nature of hps does not influence either the diffusion or the validity of the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .    to discriminate the behavior of hps from hd model one has to look at the relaxation to equilibrium , when the initial state is very far from it . for square particles relaxation properties crucially depend on the presence of the impurity , which induces a sort of `` effective interaction '' among the gas particles and allows the system to equilibrate to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "since collisions simply reshuffle the velocity components among the particles , preserving the initial velocity distribution , without the colloidal particle relaxation to maxwell - boltzmann is not possible . in spite of such a constraint",
    ", self - diffusion and other statistical mechanics behaviors can still be found @xcite ( see also sect .  [",
    "sec : diff ] ) . in the presence of the colloid , a signature of",
    "such a pathology survives : the relaxation time @xmath1 strongly depends on the mass of the impurity , whilst in hd it is independent of it .",
    "moreover , ergodicity is not fully recovered being the exchanges between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 components of the velocity forbidden .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : models ] introduces the two models . in sect .",
    "[ sec : diff ] , the numerical results for the diffusion coefficient , self - diffusion and velocity auto - correlation function are presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec : relax ] , the relaxation properties of hps and hd close - to and far - from equilibrium are analyzed .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] concludes the paper with a discussion of the relation among chaos , statistical mechanics and diffusion based on our results . in the appendix , a kinetic theory derivation of the diffusion constants for both models is presented in the very dilute limit .",
    "in the spirit of smoluchovski s approach  @xcite , it is natural to introduce a mechanical model for bm based on the dynamics of a macroscopically small but microscopically large heavy impurity colliding with many lighter particles .",
    "the large mass and size with respect to the gas particles allows for a separation of time scales so that the velocity of such an impurity is expected to follow a langevin equation .",
    "the collisions with the gas provide both the friction and the stochastic kicking to the colloid  @xcite . here , we focus on two different models in two dimensions .",
    "we consider @xmath0 hard disks of radius @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 plus an impurity consisting in another disk of radius @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 , as in fig .",
    "all particles are in a square box of side @xmath8 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "crucial parameters are the number density @xmath9 and the volume fraction @xmath10 . in the following",
    ", we shall always consider very dilute systems ( @xmath11 ) so that the properties of the system will be akin to those of a rarefied gas .",
    "the kinetic energy coincides with the total energy @xmath12 @xmath13 and is conserved . in the second equality of eq .",
    "( [ ii.1 ] ) we adopt the convention that @xmath14 indicates the colloid , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 while @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , for the coordinates , we use either @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the gas particles and @xmath21 for the mass impurity , or @xmath22 for @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "of course , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ ii.1 ] ) reduces to a system of @xmath27 identical hard disks , which has been thoroughly investigated by accurate computer simulations @xcite and theoretically in terms of kinetic theory of gases ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) in a variety of regimes .    each particle moves with constant velocity till it collides with another particle , event at which the velocities are updated according to the elastic collisions rule @xmath28 where post - collision quantities are primed , and @xmath29 is the precollisional relative velocity .",
    "the unitary vector @xmath30 , oriented as @xmath31 , connects the centers of the two disks at contact .",
    "the model ( [ ii.1 ] ) simplifies for two asymptotics : for @xmath32 , it approaches the lorentz - gas model @xcite , the impurity is much faster than the ( now heavier ) gas particles which can be treated as immobile obstacles ; for @xmath33 , the rayleigh - flight model is recovered if the @xmath0 small disks are very dilute so that most of collisions involve the impurity . in these two limits ,",
    "kinetic theory allows for analytical approximation of the maximum lyapunov exponent in terms of the system parameters @xcite .    here ,",
    "being interested in brownian motion , we consider situations in which @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in such a limit , thanks to the large time scale separation between the impurity and gas particles motions , it is reasonable to assume that each velocity component @xmath36 of the colloid follows a langevin equation ( we set @xmath37 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gas temperature , and @xmath40 a zero mean gaussian process with correlation @xmath41 . of course , eq .",
    "( [ ii.4 ] ) describes the effective dynamics of the impurity for times much larger than the average collision time with the gas particles  @xcite . the friction constant @xmath42 sets the decay of velocity - velocity correlation function @xmath43 where brackets indicate time or ensemble averages . by standard kinetic - theory computation",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammahd ] ) where also corrections in @xmath44 and @xmath45 are taken into account ) one has @xmath46 now , thanks to the green - kubo relation , linking the auto - correlation function to the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 @xmath48 it is straightforward to derive the diffusion constant of the colloidal particle @xmath49 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2\\pi } } \\ , \\frac{1}{\\rho r}\\sqrt{\\frac{t}{m}}\\,.\\ ] ] notice that @xmath50 is proportional to @xmath51 and not to @xmath39 as in liquids .",
    "this comes from the fact that in liquids the friction is temperature independent , while in rarefied gases it is proportional to the square root of the temperature .",
    "another interesting quantity , well defined both in the presence or absence of the impurity , is the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath52 of a tagged gas particle .",
    "this is an important transport coefficient associated with the gas density field evolution .",
    "previous investigations of hard disks and spheres models studied in details such a quantity as well as other transport coefficients ( e.g. , viscosity ) at varying the parameters of the problem . in the dilute limit",
    ", the particle self - diffusion coefficient takes the form @xcite : @xmath53 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{1}{\\rho r}\\sqrt{\\frac{t}{m}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 indicates the @xmath2-component of the position of a tagged gas particle . at high volume fractions , corrections to the formula",
    "must be considered .",
    "although the expression is formally similar to ( [ ii.9 ] ) , only the prefactors change , the langevin description ( [ ii.4 ] ) does not apply in this case due to the absence of time scale separation .",
    "one has to take care to work in conditions in which the coefficient ( [ ii.3 ] ) is insensitive to the presence of the impurity , so that it can be considered as a small perturbation .    before passing to the other model",
    ", it is important to give a warning . in two dimensions , as here , it is long known  @xcite that the gas velocity auto - correlation function develops small , slowly decaying tails . in principle",
    ", this may lead to an ill defined diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , when @xmath54 this problem becomes relevant only for enormously long times  @xcite . therefore , disregarding this issue is justified from the practical point of view and we will ignore it in the following .      we now consider a different model of hard - core particles in which the @xmath0 gas disks are replaced by @xmath0 squares of side @xmath55 and mass @xmath5 plus a square colloid of side @xmath56 ( @xmath6 ) and mass @xmath7 , contained in a box of size @xmath57 with periodic boundary conditions .    at the initial time , the sides of all squares are parallel ( see fig  1(right ) ) , and such parallelism is conserved ( no rotation ) by the elastic , hard - core collisions , which are now not central and amount to equal angle reflection against parallel sides .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ii.1 ] ) is still describing the system , and the collision rule ( [ eq : hdcrule ] ) are replaced by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the relative velocity , and the unitary vector @xmath60 is directed as the normal to the colliding sides , that is , either along the @xmath2 or @xmath3 axes . at variance with the hd , the hps model is not a mechanical system as its evolution does not follow the newtonian dynamics , because of the constraint keeping the parallelism among the square sides . since the collision rules ( [ eq : collsquares ] ) are linear , the evolution law for the tangent vector coincides with that of the system and the lyapunov exponents are all equal to zero . therefore , unlike the case of disks , the system is non - chaotic , although the presence of the corners may induce non - linear instabilities , producing a defocusing for non - infinitesimal displacement among two trajectories .    in the absence of the impurity the considered system reduces to @xmath0 identical parallel squares , which was studied by frisch and coworkers @xcite for its peculiar properties .",
    "this system is indeed interesting under several aspects .",
    "first of all , due the rules of interaction ( [ eq : collsquares ] ) , colliding particle pairs simply exchange their velocities along the direction of impact : similarly to @xmath61d hard rods a collision event corresponds to a relabeling of particles , though in the @xmath62 case as here the relabeling is only for one component of the velocity .",
    "this implies that all velocity moments are conserved separately for the two components .",
    "it thus follows that a velocity probability distribution function ( pdf ) , which is initially factorized @xmath63 , is preserved by the time evolution . in other words , unlike hd , the system is non - ergodic and the pdf of the velocities can not relax to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , if the initial distribution is not factorized , it will factorize @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . indeed",
    "the relabeling induced by the collisions decorrelate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 components .    in spite of these pathologies , simulations  @xcite and kinetic theory computations  @xcite",
    "show that this non - ergodic system possesses many properties akin to those of the hd , which instead is typically considered to be ergodic and mixing .",
    "for instance , transport properties are well defined and in the dilute limit .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient for an initial maxwell - boltzmann distribution can be computed  @xcite @xmath67 moreover , phase transitions similar to those found in hd can be observed for suitable values of the volume fraction @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "when the impurity is present the situation changes . due to the mass difference ( @xmath69 )",
    ", many conserved quantities are destroyed and collisions can change the velocities pdf : relaxation to maxwell - boltzmann distribution is now possible . essentially the impurity allows for an `` effective interaction '' as e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "however , ergodicity is not fully recovered : it is clear that , due to the collision rule , no mixing between the velocities along @xmath2 and @xmath3 is possible . meaning that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are separately conserved .",
    "we shall always work in isotropic conditions , i.e. with initial velocity pdf such that @xmath72    in such a condition , being an equilibrium distribution well defined , we can still consider the limits @xmath73 and @xmath35 and study the bm of the impurity . from kinetic theory ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dchs ] ) in the appendix ) , one can compute the friction coefficient @xmath74 and therefore the diffusion constant @xmath75 comparing the above expression with ( [ ii.9 ] ) reveals that the only difference lies in a numerical prefactor which takes into account the different geometries of the particles .",
    "let us now investigate , by means of numerical simulations , the transport properties ( diffusion of the impurity and self - diffusion of tagged gas particles ) in hd and hps models both in the presence and absence of the impurity .",
    "before discussing the results , we briefly summarize the numerical methods employed .",
    "for both hps and hd , we used an event driven algorithm with the minimum image convention  @xcite .",
    "all simulations refer to the rarefied case .",
    "after several tests we fixed @xmath76 and solid fraction @xmath77 , so that we can neglect all known corrections to the transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "the diffusion constants are then measured in terms of the mean square displacement in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 direction for both the colloid and tagged gas particles , see eqs .",
    "( [ ii.9 ] ) and ( [ ii.3 ] ) .",
    "working in isotropic conditions , the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficient are equal , allowing us to average over the two components for increasing statistics .",
    "averages have been computed over @xmath78 time windows in a long run .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath50 is thus obtained by looking at @xmath79 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\mathcal{n } } [ q(t+t_k)-q(t_k)]^2 \\;\\approx 2d_c t\\ , , \\label{eq : incre}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 represents any of the components of the particle position , and @xmath81 .",
    "the length of the window @xmath82 is chosen long enough to observe a diffusive regime over about two decades .",
    "for the self - diffusion we proceeded similarly , but working on the gas particle positions , @xmath83",
    ". being all gas particles equivalent , we average over them @xmath84 ^ 2 \\rangle \\!=\\ ! \\frac{1}{n\\mathcal{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\mathcal{n } } \\sum_{i=1}^{n }       [ q_i(t+t_k)-q_i(t_k)]^2 \\ ;   \\approx 2d_gt\\ , \\label{eq : selfdiff}\\ ] ] with abuse of notation the same brackets as in ( [ eq : incre ] ) are used though in ( [ eq : selfdiff ] ) the average over all particles is also performed .",
    "hd and hps simulations differ only for the collision rules . while computing the average displacements we also computed the velocity auto - correlation functions for both the colloid and gas particles @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the averages have been performed , as for the displacements , over different time windows and , for the gas , also over all particles .",
    "we work with a single impurity with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( tests with different sizes and masses have been performed ) . due to the necessity of averaging over many , typically @xmath89 ,",
    "time windows we employ a not too large number of gas particles ( @xmath90 , tests with @xmath91 have been done ) . using this relatively low number of particles and",
    "the mass ratio @xmath92 requires to take into account finite size corrections than that of the gas ( with @xmath93 ) .",
    "other corrections by terms @xmath45 and @xmath44 should be included as well , see appendix . ] .",

    "however , unlike hd , the system is non - chaotic .",
    "moreover , ergodicity is broken and there is no mixing between the horizontal and vertical components . as fig .",

    "[ fig : diffsquares]b ) . at a first sight , the agreement of the self - diffusion constant with ( [ ii.10 ] ) may appear strange .",
    "indeed , the formula derived by frisch and collaborators  @xcite refers to a gas of identical particles , where no equilibration occurs .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ ii.12 ] )",

    "we consider now the model in which no impurity is present , previously studied by frisch and collaborators @xcite . as stressed above , in such a case hd and hps ( i.e. chaotic and non - chaotic particle systems )",
    "are conceptually very different : while hd remains a well defined statistical mechanics system with relaxation to an equilibrium state independent from the initial conditions , hps never reaches equilibrium , the initial velocity distribution remains unchanged with time .",

    "[ fig : selfsquare ] , we show @xmath52 for a gas of equal hard squares with gaussian initial distribution having the same temperature as in the simulations with the impurity : the diffusive behavior is again a robust well defined property .",
    "it is worth underlining the following points .",
    "first , a diffusive behavior is observed also also in the absence of relaxation to a statistically steady state .",
    "second , the value of @xmath52 matches the theoretical value obtained by frisch @xcite and is in perfect agreement , within errorbars , with the equivalent quantity obtained in the presence of the impurity .",
    "third , the velocity - velocity correlation function , shown in the inset , decorrelates exponentially with a good degree of approximation .",
    "the presence of diffusive behaviour in non - chaotic systems is not new .",
    "models consisting of non interacting particles has been already considered in refs .",
    "however , such models , though interesting from a dynamical system point of view , consist of independent particles and thus are somehow far from a statistical mechanics perspective .",
    "the hps system here investigated is non - chaotic but having many degrees of freedom in interaction it constitutes a valuable statistical mechanical system .",
    "we conclude this section by stressing that ,",
    "although the presence of the colloid changes conceptually the properties of the system , transport properties in the presence or absence of the impurity are quantitatively the same , provided the gaussian distribution is chosen .",
    "this means that , at least , for transport properties the colloid can be considered as a small perturbation to the system , but for a non generic state .",
    "the analysis of the relaxation processes associated with spontaneous or induced statistical fluctuations represents the classical approach to probe the macrostates explored by a system . for instance , fluctuation dissipation theorems ( fdt )",
    "@xcite , relating the behavior of spontaneous fluctuations at equilibrium to the average response of a system to infinitesimal perturbations , establish a connection between equilibrium ( correlation functions ) and non - equilibrium ( response functions ) quantities .",
    "we carried out a set of simulations to determine the relaxation properties of the system both close - to the equilibrium state , characterized by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , and far - from it ( e.g. , starting from a uniform distribution ) to probe the possible influence of chaos on the statistical properties .      to gain information about transport properties by studying the relaxation to equilibrium",
    "it is useful to introduce the response function to small impulsive perturbations applied to a component @xmath36 of the velocity of the impurity .",
    "this can be obtained , e.g. , by applying a force @xmath105 which acts only at @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",

    "a deep understanding the role of chaos for brownian motion and for transport properties is a very important issue deserving further comments . with reference to previous works",
    ", we now discuss this issue by stressing how the presence / absence of ergodicity , mixing and chaos in the microscopic dynamics ( may ) influence the statistical mechanics of macroscopic systems .",
    "let us start with a few remarks on equilibrium statistical mechanics , where the problem of connecting ( micro)dynamics and ( macro)statistical features is at the origin of boltzmann s ergodic hypothesis .",
    "first , it is worth noticing that ergodicity , in its strict mathematical formulation , is an extremely demanding property .",
    "second , in spite of its theoretical importance , it is not completely satisfactory from a physical point of view as it involves global asymptotic limits , rarely encountered in practice .",
    "however , for the foundation of statistical mechanics , a widespread consensus exists on the key role played by the huge number of degrees of freedom involved in a macroscopic system rather than ergodicity .",
    "this point of view received mathematical support from the works by khinchin  @xcite , mazur and van der linden @xcite , and others .",
    "they proved that statistical mechanics works independently of ergodicity thanks to the existence of meaningful physical observables ( the so - called sum functions ) which are nearly constant on the energy surface , apart from regions of vanishing measure .",
    "support to this picture comes from the results of frisch and coworkers @xcite , who found robust statistical phenomena in a trivially non - ergodic system .",
    "nevertheless , khinchin s statements can not be the ultimate grounding of statistical mechanics because not all physically important observables belong to the class of the sum functions .",
    "since chaos grants the validity of some `` statistical laws '' even in few degrees of freedom systems , one could be tempted to invoke it as the sufficient ingredient to build a robust statistical mechanical approach grounded on hamiltonian systems . however , for this to be true , chaos in the microscopic dynamics should be enough `` strong '' .",
    "indeed , results of extended simulations in high dimensional systems @xcite have shown that chaos may be not enough to ensure the validity of the equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "let us now discuss this issue in the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics context , where the analogous of ergodicity is the mixing condition .",
    "as before , this condition is very demanding , being related to the @xmath156-space ( the set of positions and momenta of system particles ) ; while the study of macroscopic systems usually focuses on physical observable involving some projection procedures , amounting to neglect ( or average ) the effects of a large number of degrees of freedom in favor of few relevant variables .",
    "for instance , in the case of elementary transport properties the observable that matters refer to single particle properties : mean square particle displacement , correlation function and the response function either of the colloidal particle or the single gas particle .",
    "therefore , one can wonder about the microscopic conditions ensuring a `` good '' statistical behavior for the above quantities",
    ".    we can start by considering few degrees of freedom systems , where also simple deterministic chaotic models may exhibit transport properties similar to those of more realistic systems .",
    "paradigmatic examples are chaotic billiards and the lorentz gas , where particle trajectories are chaotic as a consequence of the convexity of the obstacles .",
    "numerical and theoretical works have shown that , in these systems ( under appropriate hypothesis such as hyperbolicity etc . )",
    "the transport coefficients can be quantitatively related to chaos indicators  @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that chaos is tightly related to transport .",
    "however , several examples of non - chaotic deterministic systems , such as a bouncing particle in a two - dimensional billiard with polygonal randomly distributed obstacles , possess robust transport properties @xcite . for these non - chaotic models",
    ", it has been proposed that a sort of non - linear instability mechanism is required to observe diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the existence of non - chaotic models able to display diffusion poses some doubts on the possibility to make strong statements on the role of chaos for transport .",
    "it is however important to stress that in all these models the particles do not interact , and therefore , at least from a statistical mechanics point of view , they are rather artificial .",
    "more interesting it is thus to consider many degrees of freedom systems , such a those investigated in this work . in this case",
    "the existence of quantitative relationships among chaos indicators and transport coefficients is , to the best we know , less clear ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , chaos has been proved to be relevant in the establishment of some non - equilibrium properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is fair to say that diffusion of particles is rather common in chaotic many body particle systems . on the other hand",
    ", the non - chaotic model here investigated together with the previous results by frisch and coworkers @xcite indicate that transport properties for both impurity and gas particles agree with the prediction of kinetic theory and are indistinguishable from those of the ( mixing ) hard disk model .",
    "therefore chaos , at least in the sense of positive lyapunov exponents , can not be invoked to explain the observed statistical behaviors .",
    "nevertheless , as for low dimensional models @xcite , also in hps a non infinitesimal mechanism of instability can be induced by the presence of singular corners of the squares , and these likely play a role for the diffusive behaviour .",
    "we interpret these findings in the framework developed by khinchin : the `` good transport '' properties observed in the non - mixing system result from the large number of particles and not from chaos .",
    "this is well evident for the correlation and response functions for the hard squares when , e.g. , all particle are identical and the collision dynamics reduces to a mere relabelling . in such a case",
    "the exponential relaxation of @xmath86 and @xmath132 is just a probabilistic consequence of the exponential distribution of the time interval between two consecutive collisions .",
    "we stress that here diffusive properties are the outcome of the action of many degrees of freedom , and not of non - linear instability mechanisms as in low dimensional chaotic and non - chaotic models . of course , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : relaxfar ] , chaos may favour the equilibration of the system .    as a last remark we note that the gallavotti - cohen @xcite fluctuation theorem seems to apply to non - chaotic models , at least in finite time intervals , as shown by benettin et al .",
    "@xcite who investigated a non - equilibrium version of the ehrenfest wind - tree model , which is non - chaotic . in such a system",
    ", although the maximum lyapunov exponent is zero , the presence of long irregular transients , introduces an `` effective randomness '' .    in conclusion",
    ", we think that it is very difficult to decipher the signature of chaos in transport phenomena observed in many particles systems because , as shown in this paper , it can be overwhelmed by the emergence of an `` effective dynamical randonmess '' due to the combination of : a ) coarse - graining procedure , b ) finite scale instability and c ) presence of a huge number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the characterization of this `` effective randomness '' requires the renounce to asymptotic limits ( arbitrarily long time and arbitrary resolution ) in favour of a finite time and/or finite resolution analysis @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we detail the computation of the diffusion coefficient for the colloidal particle in an uniform and rarefied hd and hps gas , following elementary kinetic theory .",
    "the basic idea is to estimate the average drag force exerted by the gas particles which collide with the impurity , by calculating the average exchanged momentum in the collisions .    consider a rarefied hd gas at equilibrium , and focus on the collision of the colloidal disk characterized by its mass @xmath134 , radius @xmath135 and precollisional velocity @xmath157 with the gas particles which are characterized by @xmath158 , respectively . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdcrule ] ) , the implulse transferred in the collision is @xmath159 @xmath160 being the precollisional relative velocity .",

    "the integration over @xmath183 yields @xmath184 , and that one on the angles gives the value @xmath185 .",
