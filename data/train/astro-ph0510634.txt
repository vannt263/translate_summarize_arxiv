    "physical processes in the plasma of the hot early universe thermalize the radiation content , and this redshifts to become the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "besides the photons from the radiation background , there were some extra photons produced from the transitions when the electrons cascaded down to the ground state after they recombined with the ionized atoms .",
    "the transition from a plasma to mainly neutral gas occurred because as the universe expanded the background temperature dropped , allowing the ions to hold onto their electrons .",
    "the photons created in this process give a distortion to the nearly perfect blackbody cmb spectrum .",
    "since recombination happens at redshift @xmath0 , then ly@xmath1 is observed at @xmath3 m today .",
    "there is approximately one of these photons per baryon , which should be compared with the @xmath4 photons per baryon in the entire cmb .",
    "however , the recombination photons are superimposed on the wien part of the cmb spectrum , and so make a potentially measurable distortion .    from the far - infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas )",
    "measurements , @xcite and @xcite showed that the cmb is well modelled by a @xmath5k blackbody , and that any deviations from this spectrum around the peak are less than 50 parts per million of the peak brightness .",
    "constraints on smooth functions , such as @xmath6- or @xmath7-distortions are similarly very stringent .",
    "however , there are much weaker constraints on narrower features in the cmb spectrum . moreover , within the last decade it has been discovered @xcite that there is a cosmic infrared background  ( cib ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which peaks at @xmath8@xmath9 m and is mainly composed of luminous infrared galaxies at moderate redshifts .",
    "the existence of this background makes it more challenging to measure the recombination distortions than would have been the case if one imagined them only as being distortions to wien tail of the cmb .",
    "however , as we shall see , the shape of the recombination line distortion is expected to be much narrower than that of the cib , and hence the signal may be detectable in a future experiment designed to measure the cib spectrum in detail .",
    "the first published calculations of the line distortions occur in the seminal papers on the cosmological recombination process by @xcite and zeldovich , kurt & sunyaev ( 1968 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations for studying the recombination process was to answer the question : ` where are the ly@xmath1 line photons from the recombination in the universe ? '",
    "( as reported in rubino - martin , hernandez - monteagudo & sunyaev 2005 ) .",
    "in fact these studies found that for hydrogen recombination ( in a cosmology which is somewhat different than the model favoured today ) there are more photons created through the two - photon 2s1s transition than from the ly@xmath1 transition . both @xcite and @xcite plot the distortion of the cmb tail caused by these line photons , but give no detail about the line shapes .",
    "other authors have included some calculation or discussion of the line distortions as part of other recombination related studies , e.g.  @xcite , and most recently @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit line shapes have never before been presented , and the helium lines have also been neglected so far . the only numerical study to show the hydrogen lines in any detail is a short conference report by @xcite , meant as a preliminary version of a more full study which never appeared . although their calculation appears to have been substantially correct , unfortunately in the one plot they show of the distortions ( their fig .",
    "2 ) it is difficult to tell precisely which effects are real and which might be numerical .",
    "some of the recombination line distortions from higher energy levels , @xmath10 , have also been calculated  @xcite . however , these high @xmath11 lines are extremely weak compared with the cmb ( below the @xmath12 level ) , while the ly@xmath1 line is well above the cmb in the wien region of the spectrum .",
    "as trumpeted by many authors , we are now entering into the era of precision cosmology .",
    "hence one might imagine that future delicate experiments may be able to measure these line distortions .",
    "since the lines are formed by the photons emitted in each transitions of the electrons , they are strongly dependent on the rate of recombination of the atoms .",
    "the distortion lines may thus be a more sensitive probe of recombination era physics than the ionization fraction @xmath13 , and the related visibility function which affects the cmb anisotropies .",
    "this is because a lot of energy must be injected in order for any physical process to change @xmath13 substantially  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general that energy will go into spectral distortions , including boosting the recombination lines .",
    "this also means that a detailed understanding of the physics of recombination is crucial for calculating the distortion .",
    "the basic physical picture for cosmological recombination has not changed since the early work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , there have been several refinements introduced since then , motivated by the increased emphasis on obtaining an accurate recombination history as part of the calculation of cmb anisotropies .",
    "seager , sasselov & scott ( 1999,2000 ) presented a detailed calculation of the whole recombination process , with no assumption of equilibrium among the energy levels .",
    "this multi - level computation involves 300 levels for both hydrogen and helium , and gives us the currently most accurate picture of the recombination history . in the context of the @xcite recombination calculation , and with the well - developed set of cosmological parameters provided by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe  ( _ wmap _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other cmb experiments , it seems an appropriate time to calculate the distortion lines to higher accuracy in order to investigate whether they could be detected and whether their detection might be cosmologically useful .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the line distortions on the cmb from the 2p1s and 2s1s transitions of h and the corresponding lines of he  ( i.e. the @xmath14p@xmath15s and @xmath14s@xmath15s transitions of hei , and the 2p1s and 2s1s transitions of heii ) during recombination , using the standard cosmological parameters and recombination history . in section  [ theory ]",
    "we will describe the model we used in the numerical calculation and give the equations used to calculate the spectral lines . in section  [ result ] we will present our results and discuss the detailed physics of the locations and shapes of the spectral lines .",
    "an approximate formula for the magnitude of the distortion in different cosmologies will also be given .",
    "other possible modifications of the spectral lines and their potential detectability will be discussed in section  [ discuss ] . and",
    "finally , we will present our conclusions in the last section .",
    "instead of adopting a full multi - level code , we use a simple 3-level model atom here . for single - electron atoms ( i.e. hi and heii ) , we consider only the ground state , the first excited state and the continuum .",
    "for the 2-electron atom ( hei ) , we consider the corresponding levels among singlet states . in general , the upper level states are considered to be in thermal equilibrium with the first excited state .",
    "case b recombination is adopted here , which means that we ignore recombinations and photo - ionizations directly to ground state .",
    "this is because the photons emitted from direct recombinations to the ground state will almost immediately reionize a nearby neutral h atom @xcite .",
    "we also include the two - photon rate from 2s to the ground state for all three atoms , with rates : @xmath16s@xmath17 @xcite ; @xmath18s@xmath17@xcite , although it makes no noticeable difference to the calculation if one uses the older value of @xmath19s@xmath17 from drake , victor & dalgamrno  ( 1969 ) ; and @xmath20s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this 3-level atom model is similar to the one used in the program recfast , with the main difference being that here we do not assume that the rate of change of the first excited state @xmath21 is zero .",

    "the shape of the lines from h , hei and heii are fairly similar .",
    "there are two distinct peaks to the 2p1s emission lines .",
    "we refer to the one located at longer wavelength as the ` pre - recombination peak ' , since the corresponding atoms had hardly started to recombine during that time .",
    "the physics of the formation of this peak will be discussed in detail in section  [ pre_recom ] .",
    "the second ( shorter wavelength ) peak is the main recombination peak , which was formed when the atoms recombined .",
    "while the longer wavelength peak actually contains almost an order of magnitude more flux , it makes a much lower relative distortion to the cmb .",
    "the ratio of the total distortion to the cmb intensity is shown in fig .",

    "it is approximately one for the main recombination peak , but @xmath105 for the pre - recombination peak .    in fig .",
    "[ sumline ] , we plot the lines from h and hei together with the cmb and an estimate of the cib .",
    "we can see that the lines which make the most significant distortion to the cmb are the ly@xmath1 line and the 2@xmath106p1@xmath106s line of hei , and that these lines form a non - trivial shape for the overall distortion .",
    "the sum of all the spectral lines and the cmb is shown in fig .",
    "[ sumline ] .",
    "note that these lines will also exist in the presence of the cib  but the shape of this background is currently quite poorly determined @xcite .",
    "we now discuss details of the physics behind the shapes of each of the main recombination lines .      during recombination ,",
    "the lyman lines are optically thick , which means that photons emitted from the transition to @xmath107 are instantly reabsorbed .",
    "however , some of the emitted photons redshift out of the line due to the expansion of the universe and this makes the ly@xmath1 transition one of the possible ways for electrons to cascade down to the ground state .",
    "the other path for electrons going from @xmath108 to @xmath107 is the two - photon transition between 2s and 1s .",
    "[ ratesh ] shows the net photon emission rate of the ly@xmath1 and two - photon transitions as a function of redshift for the standard @xmath55cdm model .",
    "the two - photon rate dominates at low redshift , where the bulk of the recombinations occur .",
    "this means that there are more photons emitted through the two - photon emission process  ( 54% of the total number of photons created during recombination of h ) than through the ly@xmath1 redshifting process .",
    "this conclusion agrees with @xcite  although of course the balance depends on the cosmological parameters  ( see * ? ? ? * ) and for today s best fit cosmology the two processes are almost equal .",
    "despite this fact , the overall strength of the two - photon emission lines are weaker because the photons are not produced with a single frequency , but with a wide spectrum ranging from 0 to @xmath90 .",
    "the location of the two - photon peak ( see fig .  [ distorthheii ] ) is also somewhat unexpected , since it is almost at the same wavelength as the ly@xmath1 recombination peak , rather than at twice the wavelength .",
    "the reason for this will be discussed in section  [ 2photonpara ] .",
    "we should also note that the tiny dip in our curves for the long - wavelength tail of the pre - recombination peak  ( see fig .",
    "[ distorthheii ] ) is due to a numerical error , when the number density of the ground state is very small .",
    "this can also be seen in the pre - recombination peak for heii .",
    "the highest ly@xmath1 peak ( shown in fig .  [ distorthheii ] ) is formed before the recombination of h has already started , approximately at @xmath109 . during that time the emission of ly@xmath1 photons",
    "is controlled by the bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate from @xmath108 ( i.e.  the @xmath110 term in equation  ( [ rlyh ] ) ) and the photo - ionization rate ( @xmath111 ) . from fig .",
    "[ prerec ] , we can see that at early times the bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate is larger than the photo - ionization rate .",
    "this indicates that when an electron recombines to the @xmath108 state , it is more likely to go down to the ground state by emission of a ly@xmath1 photon than to get ionized .",
    "the excess ly alpha photons are not reabsorbed by ground state h , but are redshifted out of the absorption frequency due to the expansion of the universe ; they escape freely and form the pre - recombination emission line . note that there is very little net recombination of h , since the huge reservoir of @xmath112ev cmb photons keeps photo - ionizing the ground state h atoms  ( see fig .",
    "[ noratio ] ) .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed explanation of the pre - recombination emission peak .",
    "the bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate from @xmath108 is initially approximately constant , as it is dominated by the spontaneous de - excitation rate ( the @xmath79 term in equation  ( [ r2phh ] ) ) . at the same time the photo - ionization rate is always decreasing as redshift decreases , since the number of high energy photons keeps decreasing with the expansion of the universe",
    ". therefore , with a constant bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate and the decreasing photo - ionization rate , the emission of ly@xmath1 photons rises .",
    "the peak of this pre - recombination line of h occurs at around @xmath113 , by which time only a very tiny amount of ground state h atoms have formed ( @xmath114 , see fig .",
    "[ prerec ] ) .",
    "these ground state h atoms build up until they can reabsorb the ly@xmath1 photons and this lowers the bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate .",
    "the decrease of the bound - bound ly@xmath1 rate is represented in the sobolev escape probability @xmath82 in equation  ( [ es_prob ] ) . at high redshift",
    ", @xmath82 is 1 and there is no trapping of ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "when h starts to recombine , the optical depth @xmath115 increases and the ly@xmath1 photons can be reabsorbed by even very small amounts of neutral h. for @xmath116 , we can approximate @xmath117 and @xmath118 . because of the increase in the number density of the ground state and the decrease in @xmath119 , the pre - recombination line decreases .",
    "one can therefore think of the ` pre - recombination peak ' as arising from direct ly@xmath1 transitions , before enough neutral h has built up to make the universe optically thick for lyman photons .",
    "this process occurs because the spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath79 term ) is faster than the photoionization rate for @xmath108 ; it increases as the universe expands , due to the weakening cmb blackbody radiation , and is quenched as the fraction of atoms in the @xmath107 level grows .",
    "the shorter wavelength peak , on the other hand , comes from the process of redshifting out of the ly@xmath1 line during the bulk of the recombination epoch .    by using the recfast program  @xcite",
    ", we can generate the main ly@xmath1 recombination peak and also the two - photon emission spectrum , by simply adding a few lines into the code .",
    "however , the pre - recombination peak can not be generated from recfast , since there the rate of change of the number density of the first excited state @xmath21 is assumed to be negligible and is related to @xmath120 via thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , in the effective 3-level formalism , the ly@xmath1 line is assumed to be optically thick throughout the whole recombination process of h ( in order to reduce the calculation into a single ode ) , which is not valid at the beginning of the recombination process .",
    "hence , one needs to follow the rate equations of both states ( i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) to generate the full ly@xmath1 emission spectrum .",
    "the pre - recombination peak of h was mentioned and plotted in the earlier work of @xcite as well , although they did not describe it in any detail .    another way to understand",
    "the line formation mechanism is to ask how many photons are made in each process _ per atom_. we find that for the main ly@xmath1 peak there are approximately 0.47 photons per hydrogen atom ( in the standard cosmology ) . during the recombination epoch , net photons for the @xmath108 to @xmath107 transitions",
    "are only made when atoms terminate at the ground state .",
    "hence we expect exactly one @xmath108 to @xmath107 photon for each atom , split between the ly@xmath1 redshifting and 2-photon processes ( and the latter splits the energy into two photons , so there are 1.06 of these photons per atom ) .",
    "for the ` pre - recombination peak ' , on the other hand , the atoms give a ly@xmath1 photon when they reach @xmath107 , but they then absorb a cmb continuum photon to get back to higher @xmath11 or become ionized . the number of times an atom cycles through this process depends on the ratio of the relevant rates . if we take the rate per unit volume from fig .",
    "[ ratesh ] and divide by the number density of hydrogen atoms at @xmath121 then we get a rate which is about an order of magnitude larger than the hubble parameter at that time .",
    "hence we expect about 10 ` pre - recombination peak ' photons per hydrogen atom .",
    "a numerical calculation gives the more precise value of 8.11 .",
    "surprisingly , the location of the peak of the line intensity of the 2s1s transition is almost the same as that of the ly@xmath1 transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ distorthheii ] , while one might have expected it to differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "in order to understand this effect , we rewrite the equation  ( [ dir_int ] ) in the following way : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , and @xmath124 with @xmath125 equation  ( [ singflux ] ) gives the redshifted flux ( measured now at ) of a single frequency @xmath126 coming from redshift @xmath127 and corresponding to the redshifted frequency @xmath128 .",
    "we first calculate the line intensity of the two - photon emission with a simple approximation : a delta function spectrum @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the frequency corresponding to the peak of the two - photon emission spectrum @xmath74 .",

    "we can see that there is a significant shift in the line centre compared with the @xmath132-function case .",
    "where does this shift come from ?",
    "we know that the frequencies of emitted photons are within the range of @xmath133 to @xmath90 at the time of emission .",
    "for a fixed redshifted frequency @xmath128 now , we can calculate the range of emission redshifts contributing to @xmath128 ( referred to as the ` contribution period ' from now on ) , which is represented by @xmath134 or @xmath135 . in fig .",

    "the smaller the redshifted frequency @xmath128 , the wider the contribution period .",
    "we might expect that the line intensity of this two - photon emission will be larger if the contribution period is longer , as there are more redshifted photons propagating from earlier times . however , this is not the case , because the rate of two - photon emission @xmath142 also varies with time , and is sharply peaked at @xmath143 13001400 .",

    "the contribution period widens with decreasing @xmath128 and covers more of the redshift range when two - photon emission is high .",
    "therefore , the flux @xmath65 is expected to increase with decreasing @xmath128 until the contribution period extends to the redshifts at which the two - photon emission peaks . as @xmath128 gets even smaller ( e.g.  @xmath149hz ) , then the contribution period becomes larger than the redshift range for two - photon emission and hence only lower energy photons can be redshifted to that redshifted frequency . as a result ,",
    "the flux @xmath65 starts to decrease , and so we have a peak .",
    "the flux peaks at @xmath150 when we use the @xmath132-function approximation .",
    "however , from fig .  [ origi2ph ] , we can see that the contribution period for @xmath150 is much greater than that of the two - photon emission period , and therefore this is not the location of peak .",
    "based on the argument presented above , we expect the peak to be at around @xmath151 , or @xmath152 m .    the basic mathematical point is that @xmath153 is extremely poorly represented by a @xmath132-function . since the spectrum @xmath74 is quite broad ,",

    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    from this rough scaling argument , we may expect that the @xmath169 dependence of the peak of the ly@xmath1 line is an approximate power law with index between @xmath170 and 0 , while for @xmath171 the corresponding power - law index is expected to lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath169 is actually more complicated when one allows for a wider range of values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the above estimation just gives a rough physical idea of the power of the dependence .",
    "a more complete numerical estimate of the peak of the recombination ly@xmath1 distortion is : @xmath172    where we have normalized to the parameters of the currently favoured cosmological model .",
    "the peak occurs at @xmath173 for all reasonable variants of the standard cosmology .",
    "we compute the recombination of heii and hei in the same way as for hydrogen .",
    "for the two - electron atom hei , we ignore all the forbidden transitions between singlet and triplet states due to the low population of the triplet states  ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath14p1@xmath106s transitions of hei are optically thick , the same situation as for h. this makes the electrons take longer to reach the ground state and causes the recombination of hei to be slower than saha equilibrium . however , unlike for h , and despite the optically thick @xmath14p1@xmath106s transition line , the @xmath14p1@xmath106s rate dominates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rateshei ] . for heii , due to the fast two - photon transition rate ( see fig .  [ heiirates ] ) , there is no ` bottleneck ' at the @xmath108 level in the recombination process .",
    "hence heii recombination can be well approximated by using the saha equilibrium formula  @xcite .",
    "we can see the effect of the above differences in recombination history on the lines : the width of the recombination peak of both h and hei is larger than that of heii .",
    "overall , the spectral lines of heii are of much lower amplitude than those of h ( see fig .",
    "[ distorthheii ] ) with the distortion to the cmb about an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the peaks of the line distortions from h and heii are located at nearly the same wavelengths . for hydrogenic ions the 1s2p energy ( and all the others )",
    "scales as @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the atomic number .",
    "hence for heii recombination takes place at @xmath176 rather than the @xmath177 for hydrogen . hence the line distortion from the 2p1s transition of heii redshifts down to about @xmath152 m , just like ly@xmath1 .",
    "the two - photon frequency spectrum of heii is the same as for h , since they both are single - electron atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , it is complicated to calculate the two - photon frequency spectrum of hei very accurately , since there is no exact wave - function for the state of the atom .",
    "@xcite used a variational method to calculate the two - photon frequency spectrum of hei with values given up to 3 significant figures . @xcite",
    "presented another calculation , giving one more digit of precision , and making the spectrum smoother , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phi_hei ] .",
    "these two calculations differ by only about 1% , which makes negligible change to the two - photon hei spectral line .",
    "all of the h and he lines ( for @xmath108 to @xmath107 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ distorthheii ] and the sum is shown as a fractional distortion to the cmb spectrum in fig .",
    "[ ratiocmb ] .",
    "we find that in the standard cosmological model , for hei recombination , there are about 0.67 photons created per helium atom in the ` main ' @xmath14p@xmath15s peak , 0.70 per helium atom in the ` pre - recombination peak ' , and 0.66 in the two - photon process",
    ". the numbers for heii recombination are 0.62 , 0.76 and 6.85 for these three processes , respectively .",
    "there are several possible improvements that we could make to the line distortion calculation . however , as we will discuss below , we do not believe that any of them will make a substantial difference to the amplitudes of the lines .    in order to calculate the distortion lines to higher accuracy",
    ", we should use the multi - level model without any thermal equilibrium assumption among the bound states .",
    "and we also need to take into account the secondary spectral distortion in the radiation field , i.e. we can not approximate the background radiation field @xmath86 as a perfect blackbody spectrum .",
    "this means , for example , that the extra photons from the recombination of hei may redshift into an energy range that can photoionize h(@xmath107 )  @xcite .",
    "we cab assess how significant this effect might be by considering the ratio of the number of cmb background photons with energy larger than @xmath178 , @xmath179 , to the number of baryons , @xmath180 , at different redshifts ( see fig .",
    "[ noratio ] ) .    roughly speaking",
    ", the recombination of h occurs at the redshift when @xmath181 is about equal to 1 .",
    "this is because at lower redshifts there are not enough high energy background photons to photo - ionize or excite electrons from the ground state to the upper states ( even to @xmath108 ) , while at higher redshift , when such transitions are possible , there are huge numbers of photons able to ionize the @xmath108 level . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ noratio ] shows the effect of the helium line distortions on the number of high energy photons ( above ly@xmath1 ) per baryon .",
    "the amount of extra distortion photons with redshifted energy larger than @xmath182 coming from the recombination of hei is only about 1 per cent of the number of hydrogen atoms .",
    "their effect is therefore expected to be negligibly small for @xmath13 .",
    "we neglect the effect of the helium recombination photons on the hydrogen line distortion , since it is clearly going to make a small correction ( at much less than the 10 per cent level ) .    as well as this particular approximation , there have been some other recent studies which have suggested that it may be necessary to make minor modifications to the recombination calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "although these proposed modifications would give only small changes to the recombination calculation , it is possible that they could have much more significant effects on the line amplitudes and shapes .",
    "recent papers have described 3 separate potential effects .    in the effective three - level model",
    ", @xcite argued that the adiabatic index of the matter should change during the recombination process , as the ionized gas becomes neutral , giving slight differences in the recombination history . @xcite",
    "have claimed that the two - photon rate between the lowest triplet state and the ground state and that between the upper singlet states and the ground state should not be ignored in the recombination of hei .",
    "and @xcite suggested that one should also include stimulated emission from the 2s state of h , due to the low frequency photons in the cmb blackbody spectrum . even if all of these effects are entirely completely correct , we find that the change to the amplitude of the main spectral distortion is much less than 10 per cent .",
    "we therefore leave the detailed discussion of these and other possible modifications to a future paper .",
    "there is no avoiding the fact that detecting these cmb spectral distortions will be difficult .",
    "there are 3 main challenges to overcome : ( 1 ) achieving the required raw sensitivity ; ( 2 ) removing the galactic foreground emission ; and ( 3 ) distinguishing the signal from the cib .",
    "let us start with the first point .",
    "we can estimate the raw sensitivity achievable in existing or planned experiments ( even although these instruments have _ not _ been designed for measuring the line distortion ) .",
    "since the relevant wavelength range is essentially impossible to observe from the ground , it will be necessary to go into space , or at least to a balloon - based mission .",
    "one existing experiment with sensitivity at relevant wavelengths is blast ( devlin et al .",
    "2004 ) , which has an array of bolometers operating at @xmath183 m on a balloon payload .",
    "the estimated sensitivity is @xmath184mjy in @xmath185s , for a 30 arcsec fwhm beam , which corresponds to @xmath186 . comparing with equation  ( [ peaklya ] ) for the peak intensity",
    ", it would take @xmath187 such detectors running for a year to detect the line distortion .",
    "the spire instrument on _ herschel _ will have a similar bolometer array , but with better beamsize .",
    "the estimated sensitivity of @xmath188mjy at @xmath189 in 1 hour for a 17.4 arcsec fwhm beamsize ( griffin , swinyard & vigroux 2001 ) corresponds to @xmath190 per detector for the @xmath191 sensitivity in @xmath185second .",
    "so detection of the line would still require @xmath192 such detectors operating for a year .",
    "these experiments are limited by thermal emission from the instrument itself , and so a significant advance would come from cooling the telescope .",
    "this is one of the main design goals of the proposed _",
    "safir _ ( leisawitz 2004 ) and _ spica _ ( nakagawa et al .",
    "2004 ) missions .",
    "one can imagine improvements of a factor @xmath193 for far - ir observations with a cooled mirror .",
    "this would put us in the regime where arrays of @xmath194 detectors ( of a size currently being manufactured for sub - mm instruments ) could achieve the desired sensitivity .",
    "one could imagine an experiment designed to have enough spectroscopic resolution to track the shape of the expected line distortion .",
    "the minimum requirement here is rather modest , with only @xmath195 in at least 3 bands .",
    "an important issue will be calibration among the different wavelengths , so that the non - thermal shape can be confidently measured . to overcome this",
    ", one might consider the use of direct spectroscopic techniques rather than filtered or frequency - sensitive bolometers .",
    "another way of quoting the required sensitivity is to say that any experiment which measures the recombination line distortion would have to measure the cib spectrum with a precision of about 1 part in @xmath196 , which is obviously a significant improvement over what can be currently achieved .",
    "a detection of the line distortion might therefore naturally come out of an extremely precise measurement of the cib spectrum , which would also constrain other high frequency distortions to the cmb spectrum .",
    "some of the design issues involved in such an experiment are discussed by @xcite .",
    "they describe a future experiment for measuring deviations of the cmb spectrum from a perfect blackbody form , with an accuracy and precision of 1 part in @xmath197",
    ". this could provide upper limits on bose - einstein distortion @xmath6 and compton distortion @xmath7 parameters at the @xmath198 level  ( the current upper limits for @xmath7 and @xmath6 are @xmath199and @xmath200 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wavelength coverage they discuss is 2120@xmath201 ( about 805,000@xmath202 m ) , which extends to much longer wavelengths than necessary for measuring the line distortion .",
    "the beam - size would be large , similar to firas , but the sensitivity achieved could easily be 100 times better . an experiment meant for detecting the line distortion would have to be another couple of orders of magnitude more sensitive still .    turning to the second of the major challenges",
    ", it will be necessary to detect this line in the presence of the strong emission from our galaxy . at @xmath203",
    "m the galactic plane can be as bright as @xmath204 which is about a billion times brighter than the signal we are looking for !",
    "of course the brightness falls dramatically as one moves away from the plane , but the only way to confidently avoid the galactic foreground is to measure it and remove it .",
    "so any experiment designed to detect the line distortion will need to cover some significant part of the sky , so that it will be possible to extrapolate to the cosmological background signal .",
    "the spectrum of the foreground emission is likely to be smoother than that of the line distortion , and it may be possible to use this fact to effectively remove it",
    ". however , it seems reasonable to imagine that the most efficient separation of the signals will involve a mixture of spatial and spectral information , as is done for cmb data ( see e.g.  patanchon et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the language of",
    "spherical harmonics , the signal we are searching for is a monopole , with a dipole at the @xmath205 level and smaller angular scale fluctuations of even lower amplitude .",
    "hence we would expect to be extrapolating the galactic foreground signals so that we can measure the overall dc level of the sky .",
    "this is made much more difficult by the presence of the cib , which is also basically a monopole signal .",
    "hence spatial information can not be used to separate the line distortion from the cib .",
    "the measurement of the line distortion is therefore made much more difficult by the unfortunate fact that the cib is several orders of magnitude brighter  this is the third of the challenges in measuring the recombination lines .    the shape of the cib spectrum is currently not very well characterised .",
    "it was detected using data from the dirbe and firas experiments on the _ cobe _ satellite .",
    "estimates for the background ( @xmath206 ) are : @xmath207 at @xmath208 m ( miville - deschnes , lagache & puget  2002 ) ; @xmath209 at @xmath203 m ( lagache , haffiner & reynolds  2000 ) ; @xmath210 at @xmath211 m ( lagache et al .",
    "1999 ; hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) ; and @xmath212 at @xmath213 m ( lagache et al .  1999 ; hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) . in each case the detections are only at the 3@xmath189 level , and the precise values vary between different prescriptions for data analysis ( see also schlegel , finkbeiner & davis  1998 ; finkbeiner , davis & schlegel  2000 ; hauser & dwek  2001 ; wright  2004 ) . the short wavelength distortion of the cmb , interpretted as a measurement of the cib ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ) can be fit with a modified blackbody with temperature @xmath214k and emissivity index 0.64 ( although there is degeneracy between these parameters ) , which we plotted in fig .",
    "[ sumline ] .",
    "the cib is thus believed to peak somewhere around @xmath203 m , which is just about where we are expecting the recombination line distortion .",
    "the accuracy with which the cib spectrum is known will have to improve by about 5 orders of magnitude before the distortion will be detectable . fortunately the spectral shape is expected to be significantly narrower than that of the cib  the line widths are similar to the @xmath215 for the last scattering surface thickness , as opposed to @xmath216 for a modified blackbody shape ( potentially even wider than this , given that the sources of the cib come from a range of redshift @xmath217 ) .    one issue , however , is how smooth the cib will be at the level of detail with which it will need to be probed .",
    "it may be that emission lines , absorption features , etc",
    ". could result in sufficiently narrow structure to obscure the recombination features .",
    "we are saved by 2 effects here : firstly the cib averaged over a large solid angle patch is the sum of countless galaxies , and hence the individual spectral features will be smeared out ; and secondly , the far - ir spectral energy distributions of known galaxies do _ not _ seem to contain strong features of the sort which might mimic the recombination distortion ( see e.g.  lagache , puget & dole  2005 ) . as we learn more about the detailed far - ir spectra of individual galaxies we will have a better idea of whether this places a fundamental limit on our ability to detect the recombination lines .",
    "overall it would appear that the line distortion should be detectable in principle , but will be quite challenging in practice .",
    "we have studied the spectral distortion to the cmb due to the ly@xmath1 and 2s1s two - photon transition of h and the corresponding lines of hei and heii .",
    "together these lines give a quite non - trivial shape to the overall distortion .",
    "the strength and shape of the line distortions are very sensitive to the details of the recombination processes in the atoms .",
    "although the amplitude of the spectral line is much smaller than the cosmic infrared background , the raw precision required is within the grasp of current technology , and one can imagine designing an experiment to measure the non - trivial line shape which we have calculated .",
    "the basic detection of the existence of this spectral distortion would provide incontrovertible proof that the universe was once a hot plasma and its amplitude would give direct constraints on physics at the recombination epoch .",
