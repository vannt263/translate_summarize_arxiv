    "the description of the properties of nuclear matter in effective models of the nuclear interactions , such as in quantum hadrodynamics , has been quite successful @xcite .",
    "early attempts to incorporate the basic symmetries of the underlying fundamental theory of the strong interactions , qcd , however , have experienced severe difficulties .",
    "lee and wick studied the standard su(2 ) linear sigma model for nuclear matter , and showed that there is a state where chiral symmetry is effectively restored by a nearly vanishing nucleon mass @xcite .",
    "it was , however , discovered immediately by kerman and miller , that the solution is unstable in the standard su(2 ) linear sigma model , and that the model can not describe nuclear matter saturation @xcite .",
    "boguta extended the linear sigma model by introducing a dynamically generated vector meson in a chirally invariant way @xcite .",
    "however , the model was unable to generate a chiral phase transition at finite density or finite temperature @xcite as the chirally restored phase was mechanically unstable . with the inclusion of an additional scalar field , the dilaton field ,",
    "the unphysical bifurcations could be avoided , although the compression modulus turned out to be unphysically high @xcite .",
    "a chiral phase transition is present for either high temperatures or high densities . in the temperature - density plane , however , the critical line of the chiral phase transition was open , so that there was no chiral phase transition present for intermediate temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the vector meson masses were generated only by the coupling to the sigma field , chiral symmetry restoration could not be reached , as the vector meson mass vanishes . also , first attempts to use a linear sigma model to describe nuclei failed @xcite .",
    "different effective interaction potentials were introduced to cure the apparent caveats of the linear sigma model .",
    "a logarithmic potential term was examined in @xcite , and successfully applied to the description of nuclear matter and nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "studies using the standard mexican hat potential were not able to adequately describe nuclei .",
    "admittedly , the logarithmic potential could not be applied for studying the chiral limit , where the pion mass becomes exactly massless in the nambu - goldstone phase .",
    "a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry was used in @xcite to successfully describe the properties of nuclear matter and nuclei .",
    "the essential ingredient of the successful approach was that the scalar field was explicitly kept as a dynamical degree of freedom to describe nuclear matter .",
    "extensions to the linear and nonlinear realization in chiral su(3 ) symmetry were performed in @xcite which included hyperon degrees of freedom and the description of hypernuclei .",
    "effects from the strange quark condensate were found to be important for arriving at a reasonable compression modulus of nuclear matter and a reasonable description of nuclei .    in all of these investigations",
    ", it appears that the scalar sigma field and its vacuum expectation value can not possibly serve , simultaneously , as the chiral partner of the pion , the generator of the nucleon mass , and the mediator of scalar attraction for nucleons .",
    "this problem emerged to be particular evident when extending the model to strange baryons , in trying to describe both the masses and the potentials for hyperons .",
    "inclusion of an additional scalar field , the dilaton field , does not remedy the situation @xcite .",
    "an alternative way of looking at the role of the sigma field for the generation of the hadron masses is established by two seemingly different chiral approaches : a hidden local symmetry for the vector mesons , and a parity doublet model for nucleons .",
    "a hidden local symmetry is a type of gauged linear sigma model : the overall mass scale of the vector and axial vector fields is fixed by a new constant , while their _ splitting _ is due to a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value for the sigma field .",
    "this model automatically exhibits vector meson dominance and gives a good description of the vacuum properties of the vector and axial vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the model was extended by the minnesota group to describe low - energy pion - nucleon scattering , the properties of nuclei , and nuclear matter at finite temperature and density @xcite .",
    "note that the chiral symmetry demands only that the spectral functions of the vector and axial vector mesons are degenerate in the chirally restored phase , and not that the vector and axial vector meson masses drop to zero ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in a parity doublet model for nucleons , the chiral partner of the nucleon , the n ,",
    "is added to the linear sigma model .",
    "this possibility was raised by sakurai , with the first realistic model given by detar and kunihiro @xcite . in a certain assignment , to be presented below , the sigma field is responsible for causing the _",
    "mass splitting _ between the nucleon and the n , while the overall mass scale of the nucleons is given by a new parameter , which couples in a chirally invariant fashion @xcite .",
    "the n , which is a negative parity state , is usually taken to have the mass of the n(1535 ) .",
    "the parity doublet model was extended to successfully describe resonances @xcite , the baryon octet @xcite , and medium effects of the n at finite densities @xcite . for this model , nuclear matter and the chiral phase transition in cold ,",
    "dense systems were studied so far only in ref .",
    "an extended scalar interaction potential with a logarithmic term was used to find stable solutions for nuclear and neutron matter , and to study the chiral phase transition at high densities .",
    "generically , the sigma field is now only responsible for mass splittings : this alleviates many of the problems present in the standard linear sigma model , and is the focus of the present work .",
    "we will study the properties of the parity doublet model for describing nuclear matter and for the chiral phase transition .",
    "we demonstrate that the instabilities of the standard linear sigma model , with a mexican hat potential , are avoided when the n is introduced as the chiral partner of the nucleon .",
    "in addition , we study the consequences of a light n on the properties of nuclear matter and the chiral phase transition .",
    "we note that the masses of the known chiral partners of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons are split by about 300 to 400 mev .",
    "further , all of the scalar mesons are extremely broad , so they are difficult to identify experimentally . according the particle data group @xcite , the sigma meson mass lies somewhere between 400 and 1200 mev . a successful description of the density distribution of nuclei demands that the mass of the sigma meson must be close to 500 mev @xcite .",
    "the mass splitting between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 , as well as that for strange d - mesons , are all in similar ranges , 300 to 400 mev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the presumptive chiral partner of the nucleon , the n(1535 ) , is located nearly 600 mev above the nucleon mass .",
    "the n(1535 ) is not very broad , contrary to the sigma or @xmath3 mesons , and decays by a large fraction to a nucleon and an @xmath4 .",
    "the phase space for the @xmath5 decay is heavily suppressed compared to the @xmath6 decay , so that the coupling strength of the n(1535 ) to the nucleon and the @xmath4 must be unnaturally large .",
    "the chiral partner of the nucleon should have a strong coupling to the pion , which is seemingly absent for the n(1535 ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the true chiral partner of the nucleon might be closer in mass to the nucleon with a similar width as for the sigma meson , so that it escaped experimental detection so far .",
    "it turns out that a smaller mass for the n reduces the critical density for the chiral phase considerably .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first we introduce the chiral su(2 ) parity model and fix its parameters . for comparison ,",
    "we study the pressure of cold nuclear matter in the standard linear sigma model , and discuss the apparently unphysical nature of its stable solutions .",
    "we then show how a parity doublet model gives a reasonable and stable description for the properties of nuclear matter .",
    "we then extend the model to high density , and study the chiral phase transition in cold nuclear matter .",
    "there are two ways of assigning chiral transformations for parity doubled nucleons . in the naive assignment ,",
    "the two nucleons belong to different multiplets , while in the mirror assignment they belong to the same multiplet , and so are true chiral partners @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter .    in the mirror model , under @xmath7 transformations @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the two nucleon fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 transform as @xmath12 this allows for a chirally invariant mass , @xmath13 : @xmath14 the chiral lagrangian in the mirror model is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coupling constants of the mesons fields ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) to the baryonic fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 . note that we assume the same vector coupling strength for both parity partners .",

    "<S> if the n is identified as the n(1535 ) , the parity doublet model shows a first order phase transition to a chirally restored phase at large densities , @xmath0 , defining the transition by the degeneracy of the masses of the nucleon and the n. if the mass of the n is chosen to be 1.2 gev , then the critical density of the chiral phase transition is lowered to three times normal nuclear matter density , and for physical values of the pion mass , the first order transition turns into a smooth crossover . </S>"
