    "given the lep2 limit on quasi - stable charginos from amsb models , where @xmath16 gev@xcite , this implies @xmath17 gev : quite beyond the reach of tevatron .",

    "pair production of inoamsb sleptons , followed by decays into quasi - stable charginos , should give rise to characteristic isolated single or dilepton plus @xmath19 signatures , accompanied by the presence of one or two highly ionizing chargino tracks ( hits)@xcite .",

    "gaugino anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking@xcite is a very simple scenario for generating susy breaking soft terms in low energy supersymmetric theories .",
    "the main assumption is that the high energy theory which generates susy breaking is of the sequestered type @xcite , which effectively means that the classical gaugino and scalar masses and @xmath26-terms are highly suppressed relative to the gravitino mass scale .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in usual supergravity ( sugra ) models , where these soft parameters are classically generated at the gravitino mass scale .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast to what is usually advocated in amsb @xcite , it has been argued @xcite that only _ gaugino masses _ are generated by weyl anomalies . in inoamsb@xcite@xcite ,",
    "the scalar masses are then generated by renormalization group ( rg ) running as in what is often called gaugino mediation@xcite or simple no - scale susy breaking models@xcite .",
    "the inoamsb model then avoids both the generic fcnc problems of gravity mediated scenarios and also the tachyonic slepton problem of the traditional amsb construct .",
    "it also avoids the presence of tau slepton lsps which occur in gaugino mediation / no - scale models with gaugino masses unified at a high scale .",
    "this very simple phenomenological model depends on just two parameters : the gravitino mass @xmath25 which sets the scale for all sparticle masses , and @xmath27 , the ratio of the the higgs vacuum expectation values in the mssm .",
    "in fact , it appears to be the simplest susy mediation model that one can conceive of which satisfies all phenomenological constraints .",
    "furthermore , inoamsb can be realized within a highly motivated class of string theories@xcite .",
    "the models in question are called the large volume compactification scenario ( lvs ) of type iib string theory and were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the moduli ( and the dilaton ) of string theory , which appear as 4d fields in the effective action , are stabilized using a combination of fluxes and non - perturbative effects ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the calabi - yau ( cy ) manifolds",
    "on which the theory is compactified to 4d is of the so - called  swiss cheese \" type with one large four cycle ( which controls the overall size of the internal space ) and one or more small cycle .",
    "an analysis of the potential for the moduli shows that the volume is exponentially large in the small cycle(s ) whose size in turn is stabilized at values larger than the string scale . the effective parameter which controls this",
    "is determined by the euler character of the cy manifold and the ( flux dependent ) value of the dilaton .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in these models , for large enough volume ( greater than @xmath28 planck units ) , fcnc effects are suppressed .",
    "indeed , all classically generated soft susy breaking parameters are volume suppressed compared to the gaugino mass soft terms that are generated by anomaly mediation .",
    "the latter effect is actually a consequence of the generation of gaugino masses by the weyl anomaly effect as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of this class of string theoretic models is effectively controlled by the gravitino mass .",
    "but the theory at this point only allows us to estimate an upper bound to the possible size of @xmath6 and @xmath29 terms .",
    "so we use the latter after trading it for ( as is usual ) @xmath27 , and regard the former as an output from the experimental value of the @xmath30 mass",
    ". the parameters of the phenomenological model which comes from these string theory considerations are thus m_3/2 ,  ,  sign ( ) .",
    "[ eq : pspace ] the gravitino mass determines the values of the gaugino masses at the high scale ( which will be chosen to be the gut scale ) by the weyl anomaly formula given in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for the scenario in @xcite , this is exactly the same as what is often given as the amsb formula for these masses _ i.e. _ m_i= m_3/2 , with @xmath31",
    ". the initial ( high scale ) values of the other soft parameters are then taken to be m_0=a_0=0 , where @xmath32 is the common soft susy breaking scalar mass evaluated at the high scale @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the trilinear soft susy breaking ( ssb ) term .",
    "we begin by examining the sort of sparticle mass spectra that is expected from the inoamsb boundary conditions : @xmath36 but with @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt a unified value of the gauge coupling @xmath38 and then for a given value of @xmath25 compute the gut scale values of the three gaugino masses @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "we compute the sparticle mass spectra using the isasugra subprogram of the event generator isajet@xcite , along with the option of non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "the parameter space is that of eq .",
    "[ eq : pspace ] .    after input of the above parameter set ,",
    "isasugra implements an iterative procedure of solving the mssm rges for the 26 coupled renormalization group equations , taking the weak scale measured gauge couplings and third generation yukawa couplings as inputs , as well as the above - listed gut scale ssb terms .",
    "isasugra implements full 2-loop rg running in the @xmath41 scheme , and minimizes the rg - improved 1-loop effective potential at an optimized scale choice @xmath42 ( which accounts for leading two - loop terms)@xcite to determine the magnitude of @xmath6 and the value of @xmath43 .",
    "all physical sparticle masses are computed with complete 1-loop corrections , and 1-loop weak scale threshold corrections are implemented for the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 yukawa couplings@xcite .",
    "the off - set of the weak scale boundary conditions due to threshold corrections ( which depend on the entire superparticle mass spectrum ) , necessitates an iterative up - down rg running solution .",

    "we note here that topologies 1 and 2 are unique to @xmath82 production , while topology 4 is unique to @xmath83 production .",
    "if a two hit topology has one of the hits missed for some reason , it will look like a single hit event .",

    "once an inoamsb signal for slepton pair production is established , then the next step will be to try to extract sparticle masses from the event kinematics .",
    "we will first look at the sneutrino pair production reaction @xmath129 , which arises when @xmath130 decay .",

    "we also emphasize here that slepton pair production only occurs in mamsb for very low @xmath32 and @xmath25 values , and the @xmath156 mass gap is quite variable for different @xmath32 values , while in inoamsb , this mass gap is essentially a fixed prediction depending only on @xmath25 .",

    "in particular , the max of the @xmath135 distribution should be somewhat higher for dilepton events with one hit , as opposed to dilepton events containing two hits .",
