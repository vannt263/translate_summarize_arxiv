    "the broyden s method provides a scheme to update the approximate inverse jacobian @xmath114 at each iteration such that good convergence is obtained  @xcite .    to achieve the global minimum of the ground - state energy ,",
    "we have done a random search of initial conditions in the parameter space .",
    "the typical number of the @xmath110 configurations used in the calculation is @xmath115 . for each given initial condition ,",
    "a broyden mixing is performed ; when convergence is approached , the corresponding ground - state energy is recorded . the global minimum of the ground - state energy",
    "is then obtained by comparing the energies for different configurations .",
    "here we present the full large - n phase diagram for the metallic ss kondo lattice , focusing in particular on the intermediate phases sketched in fig .  2 of the main text .",
    "we consider tight binding parameters @xmath116 , and a conduction electron filling @xmath59 .",
    "we find a series of intermediate states that break the lattice symmetry within the unit cell . in particular we find four intermediate states labelled with different colors in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - pd ] : blue ( 1 ) , green ( 2 ) , red ( 3 ) and grey ( 4 ) .",
    "we first consider the blue region ( 1 ) , which is the most physically relevant intermediate phase because it occurs in the transition region between the ssl - vbs and hfl phases . here",
    ", we find a phase with _ partial kondo screening _ defined as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , with @xmath119 . the local moments on sublattices a and d are screened by the kondo effect , whereas those on the @xmath120 and @xmath121 sub - lattices are locked into a vbs singlet .",
    "turning next to the green region ( 2 ) , we find a square plaquette rvb phase with kondo screening , defined by @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in this phase ,",
    "plaquette valence bonds form on each square plaquette that contains a @xmath14 bond .",
    "the red region ( 3 ) describes a phase where the rvb parameters are in a `` kite '' phase , and the local moments are screened .",
    "it is defined by @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "lastly , we come to the grey region ( 4 ) , which corresponds to a spin - peierls phase with partial kondo screening . here , @xmath132 , @xmath133 with @xmath134 ; all the other parameters vanish .     and",

    "the thin ( thick ) lines represent first order ( continuous ) transitions.,height=192 ]    we now turn the effect of changing model parameters on the global phase diagram .",
    "we first consider choosing a different value of @xmath105 ( see the main text for the definition of @xmath82 ) while keeping @xmath97 and @xmath59 .",
    "this choice of @xmath82 is still in the range over which a quantum antiferromagnetic phase arises ( see below , fig .  [ fig : m - pd ] ) .",

    "interestingly , for both cases we find the line of transitions between af@xmath7 and hfl collapse to a point .",
    "therefore , whether the transition between af@xmath7 and hfl is a line or a single point is a question that needs to be addressed beyond the mean field level , for example within an extended dynamical mean field approach .",

    "<S> in addition to the af order and its suppression , there is also the competition between the kondo effect and vbs order in the magnetically - disordered region . in the notation of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model](a ) , we associate kondo hybridization ( @xmath101 ) with a large fermi surface ( subscript @xmath102 ) and kondo destruction ( @xmath103 ) with a small fermi surface ( subscript @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram we have calculated , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m - pd ] , represents a remarkable realization of the global phase diagram that had been advanced on qualitative considerations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will be instructive to study kondo lattice models in other geometrically frustrated cases , for example kagome lattices ( pertinent to cepd@xmath1ni@xmath2al  @xcite ) and triangular lattices ( relevant to ybagge  @xcite and ybal@xmath4c@xmath4  @xcite ) , and explore the generality of the global phase diagram . compared to those cases , the kondo model on the ssl </S>",
    "<S> has the main advantage that the magnetically frustrated regime is accessible by a large-@xmath31 approach .    </S>",
    "<S> several remarks are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m - pd ] , we find a _ line _ of direct transitions from af@xmath7 to p@xmath8 . however , whether this is a line of transitions or a single point is sensitive to the model parameters in our approach and for @xmath105 we find the transition collapsing to a single point ( see the supplementary material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to consider how further quantum fluctuations will affect the topology of the phase diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m - pd ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently , insights have been gained from calculations on a quantum impurity model incorporating local quantum fluctuations  @xcite ; within an extended dynamical mean field context  @xcite , the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite imply this direct transition to be a line in the phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> second , due to an even number of spins per unit cell , the spinon bands are either empty or completely full  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the volume of the fermi surface will not change when the system goes from the ssl - vbs to the hfl phase . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the topology of the fermi surfaces reflects the incorporation ( @xmath102 ) or absence ( @xmath104 ) of the kondo resonances in the fermi volume and can be different for the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> we show the fermi surfaces for @xmath59 in the supplementary material  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> third , it is instructive to compare our results to those of ref .  . where there is overlap , the results of that work and ours are largely consistent </S>",
    "<S> we are able to draw substantially new implications by studying the competitions of all the phases pertinent to the global phase diagram , including the @xmath106 phase . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our work has also uncovered pks phases . in a similar vein </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the shastry - sutherland kondo lattice was also considered in ref .  , with a particular focus on possible superconducting pairings . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of our study for superconductivity is an intriguing issue , but is beyond the scope of the present work .    . </S>",
    "<S> thin ( thick ) lines represent first order ( continuous  @xcite ) transitions . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the systematic nature of our results is important not only for generating insights into the global phase diagram , but also to drawing implications for experiments in heavy - fermion metals . </S>",
    "<S> our phase diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m - pd ] opens up a trajectory from the af@xmath7 to the hfl phase via a sequence of quantum phase transitions that passes through a vbs , @xmath9 phase . </S>",
    "<S> this result has implications for yb@xmath0pt@xmath0pb , where experiments  @xcite appear to have realized such a sequence of transitions [ see figure  [ fig : model](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have provided evidence for intermediate , partially kondo screened phases _ in metallic cases . </S>",
    "<S> _ this type of phase has also been discussed in a variational quantum monte carlo approach in kondo insulator settings  @xcite . in this regard , it is intriguing that experiments on the metallic cepd@xmath1ni@xmath2al  @xcite have suggested that the frustration in this material is not large enough to yield a spin liquid , but instead leads to a ground state where some of the magnetic moments form long range af order , while the others are completely screened by the kondo effect .    in conclusion , we have studied the global phase diagram in the prototypical geometrically - frustrated shastry - sutherland kondo lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our work represents the first concrete calculation in which all four phases , af@xmath7 , af@xmath8 , p@xmath7 , and p@xmath8 appear in a single zero - temperature phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our results have elucidated the rich variety of quantum phases and their transitions in heavy - fermion metals , and provide new insights into the puzzling experimental observations recently made in geometrically frustrated heavy fermion metals . </S>",
