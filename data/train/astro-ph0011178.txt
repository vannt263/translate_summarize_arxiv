    "the optically undetectable source , wl  20 ( also known as bklt j162715@xmath6243843 and gy  240 , see * ? ? ? * for other aliases ) , was discovered in a near - infrared ( near - ir ) bolometer survey of a @xmath7 region of self - absorbed @xmath8co emission in the @xmath1 ophiuchi star - forming cloud @xcite . soon thereafter , wl  20 was detected at 10  from ground - based observations @xcite , and at longer wavelengths in the pointed observations mode of the _ iras _ satellite , where it is referred to as ylw  11 @xcite .    in the currently accepted classification scheme of young stellar objects ( ysos ) devised by @xcite , wl  20 was one of the first sources to be identified as a class i source @xcite .",
    "empirically , class i sources have broader than blackbody spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , with rising 210  spectral slopes , @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "theoretically , the seds of class i sources are interpreted to correspond to a remnant infalling dust and gas envelope surrounding a central protostar@xmath11disk system @xcite .",
    "the more evolved class ii sources , with @xmath12 , are pre - main - sequence ( pms ) star@xmath11disk systems that have dispersed their remnant infall envelopes .    with the advent of near - ir array detectors ,",
    "wl  20 was soon resolved into a binary system at 2.2  using a pixel scale of 085 @xcite and first reported to have an east - west separation of @xmath13 27 from observations with a pixel scale of 078 @xcite .",
    "this separation corresponds to @xmath13 340  au for an adopted distance to the cloud of 125  pc .",
    "we note that some confusion still exists as to the distance to the @xmath1 ophiuchi clouds , primarily due to many authors citing the distance to the adjacent sco - cen ob association instead .",
    "the distance to the sco - cen ob association has been determined to be 160@xmath1410  pc photometrically",
    "@xcite or 145  pc astrometrically @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the distance to the @xmath1 ophiuchi cloud itself has been determined to be 125@xmath1425  pc from detailed kinematic studies of the cloud gas @xcite , and , more recently , by a study of _ hipparcos _ parallaxes and tycho @xmath15 colors of stars of classes iii & v , which show an abrupt rise in reddening at @xmath16  pc , as expected for a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt a distance of 125  pc to the cloud in this paper .    the first indication that wl  20 is a triple system came from a deep protocam survey to identify near - ir counterparts of centimeter continuum sources in the @xmath17 ophiuchi cloud core @xcite . the vla source identified with wl  20",
    "is known as lfam  30 , and was imaged at 6  cm with an 11@xmath185  beam @xcite . with the sensitive protocam images acquired at a pixel scale of 020 , a third and weakest 2.2  component of the system",
    "was easily identified , and designated as `` 30s '' ( for the southern component of lfam  30 ) , whereas the components of the previously known near - ir binary are referred to as `` 30e '' and `` 30w '' by these authors @xcite . with 30e as the positional reference",
    ", 30w is quoted at a separation of 33 at p.a .",

    "the near - ir spectra of both wl  20:e & w were found to be consistent with those of other class ii sources , with a k ",
    "m spectral type established for wl  20:e , and a more precise k7m0 spectral type determination for wl  20:w , due to the less severe continuum veiling in its spectrum @xcite . at their assumed distance of 160  pc ,",
    "wl  20:e was determined to have a bolometric luminosity , @xmath23 , through @xmath24 , whereas wl  20:w was determined to have @xmath25 through @xmath26 .",
    "continuum veiling in the spectrum of wl  20:e precluded its placement on the h - r diagram , whereas the lesser veiling in the spectrum of wl  20:w allowed a mass estimate of 0.3  @xmath5 from its location along a @xmath27  yr pre - main - sequence isochrone @xcite .",
    "a more recent spectroscopic survey of near - ir sources in the @xmath1 ophiuchi core including many sources as faint as @xmath28 , was obtained at higher spectral resolution ( @xmath29 ) than the previously published surveys ( with @xmath30 ) , allowing for significantly improved classifications for g through m spectral types @xcite .",
    "these authors assigned a k6 spectral type to wl  20:e ( gy 240b ) , with a bolometric luminosity of 0.55  @xmath31 , and an m0 spectral type to wl  20:w ( gy 240a ) with @xmath32 ( they also assumed a distance of 160  pc ) .",
    "both sources were found to have a foreground extinction of @xmath33 .",
    "wl  20:s , with @xmath34 , was excluded from this survey as well , due to its relative dimness at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , the discrepancy between the class i sed classification of wl  20 on the one hand , and its near - ir class ii spectroscopic classifications on the other , has not been remarked upon previously .",
    "this inconsistency can only be addressed by producing spatially resolved seds of the individual components of this triple system . until now",
    ", the highest spatial resolution photometry of wl  20 longward of 4.8  has been through a 68aperture  confusing all three components @xcite . in order to better constrain the properties of wl  20:s , and of the triple system of which",
    "it is a member , we have obtained new , unprecedentedly high ( sub - arcsecond ) spatial resolution , ground - based mid - ir images of the wl  20 system , at six separate wavelengths spanning the 825  atmospheric window .",
    "additionally , we present spatially resolved near - ir imaging of this triple system .",
    "finally , we have performed careful astrometry , allowing us identify the source of the centimeter continuum emission .",
    "all mid - infrared images were obtained with mirlin , jpl s 128@xmath35128 pixel si : as camera .",
    "diffraction - limited images were obtained on the nights of 1996 april 24 at the palomar 5-m telescope , 1998 march 1314 on the keck ii 10-m telescope , and 2000 june 16 at nasa s 3-m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "pixel scales of mirlin were 015 at palomar , 0138 at keck ii , and 0475 at the irtf .",
    "observations at palomar and the irtf were made with the broadband n filter ( @xmath36  , @xmath37  ) . for reference ,",
    "the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a diffraction limited image at n - band is 047 at palomar and 078 at the irtf .",
    "observations at the keck ii telescope were made with narrower filters , with central wavelengths ( bandwidths ) of 7.9  ( 0.76  ) , 10.3  ( 1.01  ) , 12.5  ( 1.16  ) , 17.9  ( 2.00  ) , 20.8  ( 1.65  ) , and 24.5  ( 0.76  ) ; corresponding fwhms range from 017 at 7.9  to 053 at 24.5  .",
    "the flux of wl  20 at each wavelength was determined by comparison with @xmath38 sco at palomar , and at keck ii with a combination of @xmath39 boo , @xmath39 cma , @xmath39 crb , @xmath39 hya , @xmath40 leo , and @xmath41 sco , the last of which proved to be an easily resolved 045 binary .",
    "the weather at the irtf was sufficiently poor that no flux standards were observed .",
    "data were obtained with traditional mid - ir chopping and nodding techniques .",
    "the raw images were background - subtracted , shifted , and coadded with our in - house idl routine `` mac '' ( match - and - combine ) .",
    "photometry for the standard stars was performed in 25 and 23 diameter apertures for the palomar and keck ii data , respectively , when the separation between components was adequate ( as determined by the intensity contours falling to zero between the sources ) and by a combination of aperture summation and psf - fitting when the separation between wl  20:w and wl  20:s was not clean .",
    "typically , the flux ratio of a given component with respect to wl  20:e was measured via psf - fitting , then wl  20:e was calibrated with respect to the standards . the photometric consistency between all the standards at keck ii was found to be 510% at all wavelengths . though @xmath39 sco was the only standard observed at palomar , multiple observations of it over the course of the night are consistent to 5% and observations of most other wl sources @xcite observed on that night agree with published values to that level .",
    "although the irtf data were taken under extremely non - photometric conditions , special care was used during the course of the observations to acquire accurate astrometry , in order to establish which of the three components of the wl  20 system is responsible for the observed radio continuum emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , lfam ) .",
    "we imaged three additional nearby class i radio emitters ",
    "lfam  23 ( wl  22 ) , lfam  27 ( wl  15 ) , and lfam  33 ( ylw  15 ) in turn with lfam  30 ( wl  20 ) , with as little delay between images as possible , so that registration of the mid - ir source location with respect to the radio coordinates could be made as accurately as possible .",
    "if each vla source were exactly positionally coincident with its respective mid - ir counterpart , then each mid - ir source should fall on exactly the same pixel in each mirlin image . in order to reduce our astrometric errors ,",
    "seven images were obtained of wl  15 , five of wl  20 , three of wl  22 , and two of ylw  15 .",
    "the resulting scatter in the source positions for wl  22 and ylw  15 was only 0.5  arcsec , allowing relative astrometric determinations to this accuracy .",
    "near - infrared images of wl  20 were acquired with protocam , a 58@xmath3562 insb array on the nasa irtf atop mauna kea , on the night of 1990 august 03 , at 1.29 , 1.67 , 2.23 , 3.55 , and 3.82  .",
    "the pixel scale of these observations was 035 .",
    "the data were not photometric : thin cirrus clouds were present throughout the observations .",
    "software aperture photometry ( 45 apertures ) was performed on the standards ( hd147889 and bd 65@xmath421637 ) and the fluxes were found to be consistent only at the 3050% level over a fairly wide range of airmasses .",
    "nevertheless , even under such conditions , the _ intensity ratios _ between the components of wl  20 ( _ i.e. _ , the flux ratio of wl  20:w / wl  20:e and of wl  20:s / wl  20:e ) should be unaffected by weather because the sources all fall within the instantaneous field - of - view .",
    "we present diffraction - limited ( @xmath43 025 resolution at 10  ) mid - infrared images of the wl  20 triple system acquired with mirlin at the keck ii telescope , along with representative shorter wavelength images acquired with protocam at the irtf in figure  [ fig : img ] .",

    "the individual components of the wl  20 triple system are labeled in figure  [ fig : img]_e _ ( the 10.3  image ) .",
    "it is evident from inspection of figure  [ fig : img ] that whereas wl  20:s is the weakest source of the system at the shortest wavelengths , it gradually brightens towards the longer wavelengths , just as its companions to the north are dimming .",
    "eventually , wl  20:s dominates the system luminosity at the longest wavelengths ( 17.9 , 20.8 , and 24.5  ) .",
    "we have used a combination of software aperture summation and point - spread function fitting to obtain photometric information for each component of the wl  20 system individually .",

    "the seds for e and w ( figure  [ fig : sed_ir]_a _ ) are consistent with their being reddened class ii sources with modest excesses at long wavelengths , in agreement with the near - ir spectroscopic results .",
    "the spectral slopes , @xmath44 for wl  20:e , and @xmath45 for wl  20:w , are as expected for class ii sources .",
    "in fact , the shape of the sed of wl  20:w is quite close to a reddened blackbody in the near - ir ( _ i.e. _ a small near - ir excess , though the excess at mid - ir wavelengths is substantially larger ) . thus it is possible that the circumstellar material around wl  20:w may be optically thin enough for silicate emission to be present .",
    "comparison of the 10.3  fluxes ( near the center of the silicate feature ) with the `` continuum '' fluxes at 7.9 and 12.5  suggests a factor of @xmath46 excess at 10.3  in wl  20:w with respect to that anticipated from the shape of wl  20:e s sed .",
    "our single data point is not sufficiently compelling ( though it is robust ) to warrant a large discussion of silicate emission here , but future spatially - resolved mid - ir spectroscopy should address in fine detail the nature of the dust emission and absorption in these class ii sources .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the possibilities usually cited to explain such `` infrared companion '' systems include the following :    1 .   _",
    "a chance superposition of sources _ it may be that wl  20:s is not physically associated with wl  20:e & w  it is a chance superposition and therefore wl  20:s can be in any evolutionary state relative to wl  20:e & w. we must stress than we can not rule out this possibility based on currently available data .",
    "it is nevertheless well established that all three sources of the wl  20 system are ysos , and therefore , all are associated with the @xmath47 ophiuchi cloud . the space density of embedded objects in this cloud ( @xmath48 200/sq .",
    "degree , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is low enough that finding three ysos apparently separated by such small distances is very unlikely unless they are physically associated .",
    "milli - arcsecond astrometry in the near - ir over a sufficiently long time interval could prove association definitively , either by showing the sources to have a common space motion or a definite orbital motion .",
    "2 .   _ a non - coplanar system where the ir companion is viewed `` edge - on '' _ it has recently been shown that a class ii source whose flared disk , with its surface heated by the stellar radiation field , could mimic the sed of a class i source if the disk is in a nearly edge - on orientation to our line - of - sight @xcite . indeed",
    ", we argue below that wl  20:s probably does have a flared disk , though the inclination is @xmath43 20@xmath49 from edge - on . however , wl  20:s exhibits two phenomena common to ir companion systems that orientation effects can not explain if it is simply another class ii object : at 1.01.8  @xmath2 it is the dominant luminosity source in the system by a factor of two , and it is highly variable at both near- and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "neither of these would be expected if it were simply an extinguished sibling of the other two sources .",
    "we therefore consider this scenario unlikely .",
    "3 .   _ a younger age for the ir companion _ it may be that wl  20:s formed significantly later than its companions , wl  20:e & wl  20:w .",
    "the projected separations between the components of the wl  20 system range from 280460  au ( see table  [ tab : sep ] ) .",
    "these separations correspond to sound crossing times of order @xmath43 1@xmath50  yr . given that typical free - fall times of pre - collapse cores are of order @xmath51  yr , the wl  20 system must have collapsed from a single cloud core . based on this simple dynamical argument",
    ", it is highly unlikely that the individual components of the wl  20 system formed at different times .",
    "the objects are coeval ; they are in a physical configuration and a certain phase of evolution in which most of the dust accretion is occurring on one of the objects , rather than all three .",
    "_ this is the most plausible possibility for explaining the properties of the infrared companion , wl  20:s , in the wl  20 system .",
    "indications are that the observed 1.3  mm flux from the wl  20 system is centered on the cm source @xcite , which we have shown is associated with wl  20:s ( see figure  [ fig : offsets ] ) .",
    "the observed 1.3  mm flux of 95 mjy @xcite translates to a circumstellar mass of 0.03 ( 0.06 )  @xmath5 , assuming optically thin emission from dust at temperatures @xmath52 ( 50 )  k and @xmath53 @xmath54 gm@xmath55 .",
    "infrared variability , such as observed in wl  20:s ( see figure  [ fig : sed_rel ] ) , signals the presence of active accretion ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "the combined picture of this system is reminiscent of recent binary formation models ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which one component can be bright and actively accreting relative to a less luminous secondary component , depending on the initial distribution of specific angular momentum in the collapsing protostellar envelope relative to the orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "we consider such a scenario to be the most likely one to explain the properties of the wl  20 triple system .      to date , only a handful of pre - main - sequence binary or multiple systems have both spatially resolved spectroscopy and spatially resolved photometry over a wavelength range as broad as presented here ( 125  ) . with these data ,",
    "we have been able to independently infer the luminosities of wl  20:e & w to significantly higher accuracy ( @xmath56 a few percent apart from systematic effects discussed below ) than has been possible previously ( see table  [ tab : properties ] ) .",
    "this coeval system , with well - determined photospheric luminosities ( section [ sec : lum ] ) and effective temperatures , provides a stringent test to distinguish between currently available pms evolutionary models .",
    "figures [ fig : tracks]_a  d _ show isochrones ( solid lines ) and isomass ( dashed lines ) evolutionary tracks at the same scale for four different sets of pms models , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively . in each figure , the solid square denotes wl  20:e and the solid diamond denotes wl  20:w .",
    "figure [ fig : tracks]_e _ shows the range of parameter space over which pms tracks are customarily plotted ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "the solid square outline in this figure indicates the restricted range of parameter space plotted in figures [ fig : tracks]_a  d _ , in order to emphasize the improved precision with which the different sets of tracks can be compared using the wl  20 data .",
    "the two sources of systematic error in our luminosity determinations are the adopted distance , for which we are using the hipparcos - determined value , and the adopted @xmath33 .",
    "an error in the distance will move both sources up by the same amount in each panel of figure  [ fig : tracks ] : a distance of 140  pc will raise the points by @xmath57 units in the log , or about one small tick mark along the luminosity axis . similarly , a slightly greater value of extinction than the value of @xmath33 adopted here will also move the position of each source up vertically in figure  [ fig : tracks ] . with an extreme value of @xmath58 ,",
    "the luminosities are increased by @xmath59% ; 0.12 in the log , or 2.5 small tick mark(s ) .    from spatially resolved near - ir spectroscopy ,",
    "@xcite determine the spectrum of wl  20:w to be consistent with a photosphere of spectral type m2k6 , corresponding to a temperature range 3513  k @xmath60 4205  k , with an adopted spectral type of m0 ( corresponding to @xmath61  k ) .",
    "the same authors assign a k6 ( @xmath62  k ) spectral type to wl  20:e , with possible spectral types in the range k5k7 , corresponding to 4060  k @xmath60 4350  k. in figure  [ fig : tracks ] , we indicate the possible effective temperature range for each source by the horizontal error bars",
    ".    inspection of figure  [ fig : tracks ] shows that none of the models rule out wl  20:e & w being a coeval pair , within the allowable errors in spectral type for each source .",
    "however , the derived ages and masses differ amongst the models .",
    "the @xcite tracks yield a system age of @xmath43  2.0@xmath63  yr , with a mass of 0.620.68  @xmath5 for wl  20:e and a mass of 0.510.55  @xmath5 for wl  20:w .",
    "all the other models yield a system age twice as old : 4@xmath64  yr . for an age of @xmath65  yr , the @xcite models yield masses of 0.86  @xmath66 for wl  20:e and 0.68  @xmath5 for wl  20:w , respectively",
    ". the @xcite tracks yield a coeval system age of @xmath64  yr , with masses of 0.83  @xmath5 for wl  20:e and 0.70  @xmath5 for wl  20:w .",
    "similarly , the @xcite tracks yield a coeval system age of @xmath67  yr , with masses of 0.85  @xmath5 for wl  20:e and @xmath68 for wl  20:w .    of the two possible ages for this system , 4@xmath64  yr or 2.0@xmath4  yr , the younger age is the more plausible one , especially when we consider that wl  20:s , which appears to be a class i object , is also part of this system .",
    "based on statistical arguments , class i objects are generally thought to be just a @xmath69  yr old @xcite , maybe @xmath70  yr at most @xcite .",
    "previous statistical studies have ignored the systematic effects introduced by unresolved binary / multiple systems , however , which have the effect of making a source appear brighter ( and therefore , judged to be younger ) , than is , in fact , the case .",
    "such an effect can result in derived ages of a factor of two too young @xcite , so that the oldest class i sources may be of order @xmath71  yr old , just about consistent with the @xmath72  yr old system age derived from the @xcite and @xcite tracks .",
    "very recently , pre - main - sequence tracks which include the effects of accretion on the models have been calculated @xcite .",
    "these authors provide the magnitude of the errors possible when one derives ages and masses of pms objects from evolutionary tracks that ignore accretion , such as the ones discussed above .",
    "in particular , placement of wl  20:e & w on their figure 14 , shows that the derived age from the other tracks , including those of @xcite , can be up to a factor of two too old , relative to accreting pms models , making the true ages of wl  20:e and wl  20:w as young as 1@xmath73  yr , consistent with the oldest plausible class i source age of @xmath74  yr for wl  20:s .",
    "the errors in the masses of pms objects derived from non - accreting vs.  accreting tracks are much smaller , being negligible in the case of wl  20:e and at the 10% level for wl  20:w ( found by placing these sources on figure 13 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in this work",
    ", we have found that : 1 ) wl  20:s is the reddest and most luminous member of the wl  20 system ; 2 ) it is highly variable on timescales of a few years ; 3 ) it contains most of the dust in the system in a mid - ir emitting region some 40  au in diameter ; and 4 ) that it is the source of the observed centimeter emission .",
    "the most likely explanation for the mid - ir appearance of wl  20:s is that it is experiencing a phase of enhanced ( and varying ) accretion activity , perhaps due to interactions with its neighbors .",
    "this is especially likely in view of the fact that the sed of wl  20:s is consistent with the presence of a flared disk of @xmath75  au in radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eqn .  1 ) , very similar to the projected separation of 280  au between wl  20:s and wl  20:w .",
    "we observe a structure whose 40  au diameter size appears to be wavelength - independent in the mid - ir : this structure may be the flared disk surface .",
    "the iras fluxes for the wl  20 system , as a whole , are systematically larger than the sum of the fluxes of the individual components derived from ground - based observations ( see table [ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy in the measured fluxes in different - sized beams implies the presence of material on scales larger than those to which the ground - based observations are sensitive , but that still fall within an iras beam .",
    "thus , @xmath76 40% of the observed iras fluxes are emitted from regions 10@xmath77120@xmath77 in size , corresponding to the size scales of infalling envelopes .",
    "it may very well be that wl  20:s is actively accreting matter from the envelope , through its flaring disk , while its companions have already ceased significant accretion .",
    "if this is true , it addresses one of the primary objections to wl  20 being a true triple system , as opposed to a chance superposition of a binary ( wl",
    "20:e & w ) with a single source ( wl  20:s ) . if wl  20 is a triple with an age of @xmath78  yr , that is still uncomfortably old to have the presence of a class i source , which would normally be presumed to be @xmath79  yr old .",
    "this would appear to argue that wl  20:s is more likely a chance superposition .",
    "however , if accretion has been continued to a late phase due to tidal interactions with the other members , then the shape of the sed of an individual source within a binary / multiple system is an indicator only of the accretion activity of that source , and has little to do with its age .",
    "preliminary studies of accretion in triple systems have so far focussed on hierarchical triples , in which the separation between two sources is much smaller than their distance to the third component , a circumstance clearly not applicable to the wl  20 system .",
    "in fact , if formation proceeds through fragmentation , then the resultant triples are typically not in a very hierarchical configuration .",
    "the stability of accreting triples has been examined by @xcite . in general , if the maximum separation of the closer pair ( 280  au projected separation for wl  20:s & wl  20:w ) is comparable to the minimum separation of this pair to the third component ( 400  au projected separation from wl  20:w to wl  20:e ) , then the stability of the system is questionable . from the above analysis of existing pms models ,",
    "the current best mass determinations for this system are 0.620.68  @xmath5 for wl  20:e and 0.510.55  @xmath5 for wl  20:w , respectively , and @xmath43 1.0  @xmath5 for wl  20:s from the constraints given by its 1.01.8  @xmath3 luminosity . according to the criterion for stability of triple systems given by @xcite ,",
    "as quoted in @xcite , the wl  20 system should be dynamically unstable .",
    "the behavior of dynamically unstable accreting triple systems has not yet been examined .",
    "it may be that some fraction of single stars are formed from the disintegration of unstable triple systems .",
    "we have presented sub - arcsecond , mid - infrared imaging photometry of the wl  20 triple system at 7.9 , 10.3 , 12.5 , 17.9 , 20.8 , and 24.5 @xmath80 m .",
    "when supplemented by spatially - resolved , near - infrared imaging photometry from protocam at the irtf , these combined data allow solid determinations of the spectral energy distribution of each source individually , as well as accurate luminosity determinations .",
    "we find the source luminosities for wl  20:e , wl  20:w , and wl  20:s to be 0.61  @xmath2 , 0.39  @xmath2 , and 1.01.8  @xmath2 , respectively . for wl  20:e and wl  20:w , 0.53  @xmath3 and 0.35  @xmath2 can be attributed to photospheric emission alone .",
    "wl  20 can now be classified as an `` infrared companion system , '' with wl  20:s exhibiting an embedded protostellar ( class i ) sed , while its two neighbors , wl  20:e and wl  20:w , each exhibit t  tauri star ( class ii ) seds .",
    "the infrared companion , wl  20:s , is the dominant luminosity source in the system .",
    "wl  20:s differs from its t  tauri companions in three important respects : 1 ) its near- and mid - ir fluxes vary significantly over timescales of years ; 2 ) it is well - resolved at mid - ir wavelengths , with a constant , wavelength - independent source diameter of 40  au ; and 3 ) it is found to be the source of the radio cm emission in the system .    since the effective temperatures of wl  20:e &",
    "w are known from spatially - resolved near - ir spectroscopy , we can place these sources on a hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "we are thus able to test currently available pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks at unprecedentedly high temporal resolution and find that of the non - accreting models , the @xcite tracks yield the most plausible system age , at 2.0@xmath4  yr .",
    "the inferred source masses from these tracks at these ages are 0.620.68  @xmath66 for wl  20:e and 0.510.55  @xmath5 for wl  20:w , respectively .",
    "we can not , at present , independently determine a mass or age for the infrared companion , wl  20:s .",
    "however , the intriguing possibility now exists of determining the spectral type , and , therefore , the effective temperature of this embedded source with the new generation of high - resolution spectrographs on 810  m ground - based telescopes .",
    "once an effective temperature determination has been made spectroscopically , and assuming system coevality , one could locate wl  20:s on an isomass track , independently of its known luminosity .",
    "thus , the possibility exists , for the first time , to directly derive the accretion luminosity of a class i protostar .",
    "millimeter interferometry of this unique triple system would advance our understanding of the gas dynamics involved , processes which can not be explored in any other way .",
    "higher temporal resolution spatially - resolved imaging and monitoring of wl  20 at infrared wavelengths , combined with detailed modeling of its appearance will also lead to a more detailed understanding of the actual accretion processes taking place in wl  20:s .",
