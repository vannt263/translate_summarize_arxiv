    "trapped ions provide an excellent experimental platform for the measurement of atomic properties such as transition frequencies , branching fractions and lifetimes of atomic energy levels .",
    "trapped ions can be cooled easily into the millikelvin regime and are well isolated from their environment . in addition , all relevant experimental parameters such as trap frequency , magnetic and electric fields are well controlled . because of these features , trapped ions are particularly well - suited to implement atomic clocks @xcite and a large body of work has been carried out to study dipole forbidden narrow atomic transitions @xcite",
    ". however , outside the context of atomic clocks , absolute frequency measurements of dipole allowed transitions are also of interest .",
    "for example , in the astrophysics community , spectra from galactic objects stem mainly from dipole allowed transitions in ions and it is desirable to compare them to precisely measured laboratory values @xcite .",
    "a serious complication in performing spectroscopy of commonly used trapped ions is that the excited state does not only decay into the ground state but also into metastable levels ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] as an example ) .",
    "for instance , experiments with ca@xmath4 , ba@xmath4 , yb@xmath4and sr@xmath4  ions require additional repumping lasers to depopulate those so - called dark states . however , the presence of the repumping laser strongly modifies the spectrum of the primary spectroscopy laser applied between the ground and the excited state .",
    "moreover , changing the frequency of the spectroscopy and repumping lasers during the spectroscopy measurements modifies the cooling dynamics and influences the effective profile of the spectrum .",
    "this complication is present even in the case of two level systems . to circumvent this complication , experiments on mg@xmath4  ions , with an essentially two - level structure , use sympathetic cooling of additional ions to maintain low temperature throughout the experiment @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to first cool the ions and apply the spectroscopy laser only for a short duration , as carried out in ca@xmath4@xcite .",
    "however , for most ion species , ac - stark effects and dark resonances due to the presence of the repumping laser still influence the obtained spectra strongly .    in this work ,",
    "we present an experimental scheme that circumvents the complications of both dark resonances and doppler heating .",
    "we apply the scheme to ca@xmath4and perform spectroscopy of the @xmath0s@xmath1p@xmath2 and @xmath0d@xmath3p@xmath2 transitions .",
    "the scheme relies on fast photon counting and rapid switching of laser pulses similar to the one presented for the purposes of measuring the branching fractions in @xcite .",
    "the method is applicable to ion species with a lambda - level scheme , provided that the metastable state has a significantly longer lifetime compared to the excited state .",
    "we measure the center frequency of both dipole allowed transitions with an statistical significance on the order of 200 khz even in the presence of strong micromotion in 10 minutes of measurement time .",
    "in addition , we directly observe the micromotion modulated spectra of both the @xmath0s@xmath1p@xmath2 and @xmath0d@xmath3p@xmath2 transitions in ca@xmath4  and measure the dependence of the micromotion modulation index on the trap frequency .",
    "in this section , we describe the experimental scheme for performing spectroscopy on the two dipole allowed transitions presented in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "in particular , we consider an excited state @xmath5 , which can decay back to a ground state @xmath6 or to a metastable state @xmath7 with probabilities of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "first , we analyze the spectroscopy of the @xmath6 to @xmath5 transition . a probe laser couples these two states with the rate @xmath10 , which depends on the laser detuning and intensity .",
    "let the atom be initially in the ground state , @xmath6 .",
    "then the fluorescence due to the probe laser decreases exponentially as the atom is pumped to @xmath7 .",
    "the experimental scheme relies on collecting the scattered photons for a short enough duration such that the scattering rate had not yet slowed down .",
    "this is achieved by making sure that the fluorescence stays constant during the detection window ( see fig . [ detection_scheme ] ) .",
    "moreover , we would like to keep the probe laser intensity low to avoid power broadening of the atomic transition .",
    "after switching off the probe light , the repumping laser is switched on to prepare the atom in @xmath6 for the next probe cycle .    to describe the dynamics of the atomic populations in detail , we use a set of rate equations @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the decay rate of the excited",
    "state and @xmath13 is the atomic population in state @xmath14 . with initial conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and in the limit of low saturation ( @xmath17 )",
    ", the time evolution of the excited state population is given by @xmath18 the number of photons scattered after a duration @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 we expand for @xmath21 and obtain @xmath22 this shows that for @xmath17 ( low saturation ) and @xmath21 ( short probe duration ) , the number of photons detected in a duration @xmath19 is directly proportional to the coupling rate of the probe laser , @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , for a small duration @xmath19 , we are able to perform spectroscopy of the transition with no repumping laser and without perturbations from the cooling dynamics .",
    "similarly , we analyze the spectroscopy of the @xmath7 to @xmath5 transition . a probe laser couples these two states with the rate @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental scheme is similar to the case of the spectroscopy of the @xmath6 to @xmath5 transition except that we do not directly detect photons scattered from the @xmath7 to @xmath5 transition .",
    "however , we can detect the photons emitted from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where the photon emission rate is directly proportional to the population in @xmath5 .",
    "we again describe the dynamics of the atomic population using rate equations : @xmath24 since experimentally , we only detect photons emitted from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , the number of photons emitted from this transition is exactly the population of @xmath6 . at low saturation limit ( @xmath25 ) , this is given by @xmath26 the number of photons detected after a duration @xmath19 is @xmath27 where we expand for @xmath28 .",
    "this shows that , for @xmath25 and @xmath28 , the number of photons detected from @xmath5 to @xmath6 transition for a duration @xmath19 is directly proportional to the coupling rate of the probe laser , @xmath23 .",
    "we apply this method to measure fluorescence spectra of trapped ca@xmath4 . in this case , the laser wavelengths that couple @xmath29 and @xmath30 are at 397 nm and 866 nm , respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the experimental apparatus ) . to observe the fluorescence spectrum for the @xmath29 transition , in each measurement iteration , the 397 nm laser ( the probe )",
    "is first turned on for a short duration .",
    "we adjust the intensity and the duration of the probe beam such that the fluorescence from the ions is constant during the probing time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ detection_scheme]a .",
    "this ensures that the probability that ions are excited is small . after switching off the probe light ,",
    "the ions are reset to @xmath6 with a strong pulse at 866  nm , preparing all the ions at the ground state for the next iteration .    to observe the fluorescence spectrum for the @xmath30 transition ,",
    "the roles of the 397 nm and 866 nm are reversed , as shown in in fig .",
    "[ detection_scheme]b . in both cases ,",
    "only the 397 nm photons scattered from ions are collected during the probe duration . for our measurement ,",
    "the probe beam duration is typically 2 @xmath31 and the reset beam duration is typically 10 @xmath31 . for switching the laser intensities , we use acousto - optical modulators ( aoms ) in a double - pass configuration .    to minimize heating and cooling effects of the ions from due to the probe and reset laser , we perform doppler cooling a period of 1 ms after every 50 repetitions of the measurement cycle .",
    "since the fluorescence is constant during the detection window , on average , we scatter less than one photon from the probe laser during each measurement cycle , the ions remain close to the doppler temperature throughout the experiment .",
    "[ single_spectrum ] shows the spectrum obtained with this method on the @xmath0s@xmath1p@xmath2 transition .",
    "the method is not restricted to a single ion , which allows us to increase signal - to - noise by performing measurement with many ions .",
    "for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ single_spectrum ] , we use 7 ions and @xmath32@xmath33 cycles per each probe laser frequency .",
    "this corresponds to a total of measurement time of 10 minutes .",
    "the solid line is a lorentzian profile with a natural linewidth of 22.4 mhz @xcite .",
    "we also include line broadenings from the zeeman effect due to an applied magnetic field of @xmath320.8 gauss and the micromotion , which will be discussed in details in the next section .",
    "the fit yields @xmath34 , and the center of the spectrum is detected with a precision on the order of @xmath32@xmath35 khz .",
    "in this section we study micromotion modulated spectra of trapped ions of both @xmath0s@xmath1p@xmath2 and @xmath0d@xmath3p@xmath2 transitions in ca@xmath4  using the method described in the previous section .    to describe the effect of the micromotion caused by a radio - frequency ( rf ) drive in a linear paul trap , we follow the analysis by berkeland _",
    "we consider a case where the micromotion of the ions is dominated by the excess micromotion in the radial directions caused by a stray static electric field .",
    "we also include a possibility of having an additional micromotion caused by a relative phase difference of the potentials between trap rf - electrodes .    due to the doppler effect",

    "the dependence of the micromotion modulation index on the two radial trap frequencies , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , is given by eq .",

    ". we also account for additional line splittings due to the zeeman effect by summing over all possible magnetic sublevels .",
    "we use the experimental scheme described in the previous section to observe the modulations of fluorescence spectra of the @xmath0s@xmath1p@xmath2 transition from ion micromotion .",
    "we measure the modulation index , @xmath44 , as a function of the radial trap frequencies . by changing the amplitude of the rf - drive applied to the trap electrodes ,",

    "the fit yields @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the value of @xmath52 suggests that the effect from the phase difference of the potentials on the trap electrodes is small .",
    "we also observe the micromotion modulated fluorescence spectra of the @xmath0d@xmath3p@xmath2 transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ red_spectrum ] , which are measured at two different trap frequencies . at the trap frequency of @xmath62 ,",

    "since we are able to directly observe the effect of micromotion on the fluorescence spectra , this method can be used to compensate excess micromotion in the direction along the laser beam direction , @xmath38 .",
    "the projection of the micromotion can be on either the main doppler cooling laser ( 397 nm for ca@xmath4 ) or the repumper laser ( 866 nm for ca@xmath4 ) .",
