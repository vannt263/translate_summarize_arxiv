    "the vertical branch , where data points are scattered up to @xmath5 3500 cu , are the bright pixels corresponding to the regions of _ b _ @xmath8 -18 .",
    "being close to the galactic plane , they represent the scattered component of the high - intensity radiation fields from the galactic plane .",
    "we also note that fuv intensity is anti - correlated with dust extinction for _ e(b - v ) _ above 0.2 , which is reasonable for an optically thick region such as r cra of the present case , as can be seen in figure [ fig : fuv](b ) . the dense cloud at ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) @xmath5 ( 0 , -18 ) in figure [ fig : fuv](b ) , corresponding to the partial extinction seen in the fuv continuum map of figure [ fig : fuv](a ) , is the r cra molecular cloud @xcite which is located at a distance of @xmath5170 pc from the sun @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows the spectrum made with _ fims _ over the rectangular region spanning from ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) = ( -10 , -35 ) to ( 20 , -5 ) of gsh 006 - 15 + 7 .",
    "bright point sources in the region were removed from the data set when obtaining the above spectrum .",
    "more specifically , the pixels corresponding to the bright stars in the td-1 catalog with 1565  band flux of above 10@xmath21 erg @xmath14 s@xmath14 @xmath3 were removed , together with those within a radius of 2around the stars whose intensities were more than twice as high as the median values . among various emission peaks ,",
    "the emission line is readily noticeable in the spectrum , together with h@xmath1 fluorescent emission features .",
    "while the molecular hydrogen emission is associated with the shell boundaries , it will be shown that the emission does not seem to be related to the shell .",
    "as mentioned previously , the fuv continuum emission associated with gsh 006 - 15 + 7 is mainly from dust scattering .",
    "hence , we attempted simulations of dust scattering to obtain the distance to the supershell region , by comparing the observation with a simulation for the fuv continuum , as was done previously for many individual targets @xcite .",
    "this will produce an independent measurement of the distance that we will compare with the 1500 @xmath0 500 pc distance estimate that @xcite calculated from the gas kinematics .",
    "for comparison with the dust scattering simulation , the observed fuv map should also have only the contribution from dust scattering .",
    "we found that other sources of fuv emission have only a small effect on this region : ion line emission and h@xmath1 fluorescent emission are @xmath518 percent of the total fuv intensity , and the two photon continuum emission ranges from @xmath520 to @xmath590 cu , based on the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas @xcite .",
    "we used the conversion factor of 28.4 cu for 1 rayleigh of h@xmath11 intensity to obtain the two photon continuum emission @xcite .",
    "these contributions were removed from the map of figure [ fig : fuv](a ) and the result is shown in figure [ fig : dust](a ) with dust extinction contours at _ e(b - v ) _ of 0.07 , 0.14 and 0.21 for the lower supershell region .",
    "the simulation code employs a heney - greenstein function for the scattering model : it describes light scattering off grains using the albedo and the phase function asymmetry factor , or the g - factor , as free parameters @xcite . in the present simulations , however ,",
    "the albedo and g - factor are fixed at 0.4 and 0.6 , respectively , based on the theoretical estimations for carbonaceous - silicate grains @xcite , and monte carlo simulations are performed for various distributions of dust to obtain the best dust distribution model by comparing the simulated fuv intensity with the observed one .",
    "we take a rectangular box of 280 @xmath12 280 @xmath12 700 cells as the simulation domain , corresponding to 1400 pc @xmath12 1400 pc @xmath12 3500 pc with the longest dimension along the line of sight .",
    "the center of the map of ( _ l _ , _ b _ ) = ( 5 , -25 ) corresponds to the sightline of the central axis , and the sun is located in the center of the front face .",
    "the 1400 pc @xmath12 1400 pc size at the rear face spans an angular size of 226 @xmath12 226 on the sky , encompassing the lower supershell region of 20@xmath12 20 .",
    "the dust distribution of the supershell is idealized to be a single slab whose distance and thickness are to be determined in comparison with the observed fuv map .",
    "we note that the region also has a local cloud r cra , as well as a possible contribution from the foreground , both of which must be subtracted from the sfd map to obtain the effect of dust solely associated with the supershell .",
    "the foreground contribution is modeled as follows .",
    "we divide the sfd map of _ l _",
    "= -5to 15into 500 vertical strips and fit each strip with a linear function that generally follows the minimum of _ e(b - v)_. each linear fit , given as a function of latitude , represents the _ e(b - v ) _ value integrated along the sightline of the given latitude .",
    "we distribute dust along the sightline according to the distance from the galactic plane assuming that dust distribution has an exponential decrease outwards from the galactic plane with a scale height of 100 pc in view of the previous studies @xcite . with this distribution of dust ,",
    "88 percent of the total foreground dust is located within 500 pc from the sun , and 99 percent within 1000 pc .",
    "the amount of dust associated with the supershell is determined by subtracting these foreground values from those of the sfd map at corresponding locations . for the region of the supershell",

    "this given distribution of dust for the foreground and r cra , the distance to the dust clouds corresponding to the supershell is decided by comparing the simulation with the observation for the fuv continuum .",
    "the source photons to be scattered by dust are difficult to model for distant targets such as gsh 006 - 15 + 7 since stars have not been completely surveyed to comparable distances .",
    "in fact , the number of observed stars decreases rapidly when the distance from the sun is greater than @xmath5500 pc .",
    "hence , we consider two types of source photons .",
    "first , the photons from the bright stars of the td-1 catalogs are scattered by the foreground dust and the r cra cloud .",
    "second , for scattering from the supershell gsh 006 - 15 + 7 , we adopted the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) obtained from the galprop code ( http://galprop.stanford.edu/ and * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "galprop provides energy density at a specified wavelength , for which we adopt @xmath18 = 1565  , as a function of location .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath18 = 1565  is one of the passbands of the td-1 catalogs and is located nearly at the center of the fuv passband of _",
    "galex_. furthermore , we confirmed that galprop gives a specific energy density at @xmath18 = 1565  , which is very similar to the mean energy density averaged over the wavelength range of 13501750  .",
    "we assume the photons , corresponding to the specified energy density at a given location , originate from the galactic plane and propagate vertically to the supershell , which we believe is reasonable as the supershell is located in the high latitude region and there are not many nearby stars .",
    "the scattered photons from the supershell are allowed to interact with the foreground dust as well as r cra .    with these photon sources , together with the model distribution of foreground dust and r cra ,",
    "simulations were conducted for different sets of distance and thickness of the supershell .",
    "the distance is varied from 500 pc to 2500 pc with 100 pc steps , and the thickness from 20 pc to 200 pc with 20 pc steps , and the resulting images are compared with the observation for the region below _",

    "the 1-sigma confidence range of the fit is 1300 @xmath0 800 pc for the distance to the center of the dust slab , which is in good agreement with the estimation of 1500 @xmath0 500 pc by @xcite .",
    "we have also varied albedo and g - factor over a reasonable range , with albedo from 0.3 to 0.5 and g - factor from 0.4 to 0.7 based on @xcite , respectively , to check the dependence of the distance estimation on the changes of these optical parameters .",

    "<S> we have analyzed the archival data of fuv observations for the region of gsh 006 - 15 + 7 , a large shell - like structure discovered by @xcite from the velocity maps . </S>",
    "<S> fuv emission is seen to be enhanced in the lower supershell region . </S>",
    "<S> the fuv emission is considered to come mainly from the scattering of interstellar photons by dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> a corresponding monte carlo simulation indicates that the distance to the supershell is 1300 @xmath0 800 pc , which is similar to the previous estimation of 1500 @xmath0 500 pc based on kinematic considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum at lower galactic latitudes of the supershell exhibits molecular hydrogen fluorescence lines ; a simulation model for this candidate photodissociation region ( pdr ) yields an h@xmath1 column density of n(h@xmath1 ) = 10@xmath2 @xmath3 with a rather high total hydrogen density of n@xmath4 @xmath5 30 @xmath6 . </S>"
