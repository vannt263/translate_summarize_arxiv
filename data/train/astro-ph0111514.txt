    "a longstanding suggestion has been that there is a so - called `` big - blue - bump '' ( bbb ) of continuum emission , peaking in the unseen x - ray to uv ( xuv ) regime , perhaps originating in the accretion disk .",
    "there are indications of the low energy tail of this component in the uv spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the peak energy of the disk emission is predicted to be dependent on the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "thus the spectral - energy - distribution ( sed ) of an agn provides crucial information about accretion rates and conditions close to the disk .",
    "however , determination of the xuv continuum in agn has been extremely difficult because of the severe attenuation of photons of these energies by even small amounts of galactic material along the line - of - sight .",
    "some indication of the strength of the unseen continuum has been inferred from the strengths of emission lines such as 2@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite",
    "have suggested the form of the unseen xuv spectrum is @xmath1 with @xmath2 between the lyman limit ( at 912  ) and @xmath3kev . @xcite",
    "combine this with a mean soft x - ray spectrum , based upon _",
    "rosat _ observations of quasars , to dispute the existence of a large xuv bump .",
    "@xcite extend the work of @xcite by including more data in the extreme uv band ; those authors find the data to be adequately represented by a simple power - law with @xmath4 between 500 and 1200  .",
    "@xcite have discussed the problem that extrapolating the known soft x - ray spectrum of agn , there appear to be too few 54.4 ev photons to account for the strength of the observed lines .",
    "they consider the possibility that the broad - line clouds see a harder continuum than the observer does , or that the xuv spectrum has a double - peaked shape .",
    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1s ) were first classified on the basis of their unusual optical properties , most notably , lying at the lower end of the distribution of line widths , for permitted optical lines .",
    "specifically , widths of h@xmath5 fwhm @xmath6 ^ -1 km s@xmath7 have been taken as the defining quality of nlsy1s , although it is widely acknowledged that this value is arbitrary and there is a continuous range of broad - band properties across the seyfert population . nevertheless , the distinction is useful , as an object s place in the line - width distribution of the seyfert population is an indicator of other properties , especially the x - ray properties .",
    "nlsy1s appear to have systematically different , or very extreme x - ray attributes compared to the rest of the seyfert population , which we will henceforth refer to as broad - line - seyfert 1s ( blsy1s ) .",
    "for example , examination of x - ray properties across the seyfert population reveals that fwhm h@xmath5 is strongly anti - correlated with the excess variance @xmath8 ( @xcite ; where @xmath9 $ ] for a light curve with @xmath10 points of counts @xmath11 and unweighted mean @xmath12 ) and anti - correlated with x - ray index , in the sense that nlsy1s are most variable and have steeper spectra @xcite .",
    "these correlations suggest a fundamental difference between blsy1s and nlsy1s , the latter being thought to represent the low mass and/or high accretion - rate systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for black holes operating near @xmath13 ,",
    "the accretion disk surface is predicted to be highly ionized , thus the disk spectrum is expected to peak at higher energies in nlsy1s than in blsy1s . in the soft x - ray regime",
    "the nlsy1s ton  s180 and arakelian  564 ( akn  564 ) show a hump of emission close to 1kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could be the signature of a hot disk .",
    "@xcite also suggested an ionized disk as the origin of a soft x - ray component in pg @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , at least nine agn are known to possess a soft hump with characteristic shape as described for ton  s180 .",
    "these agn are all nlsy1s : pg  1244@xmath15 @xcite ; iras  13224 - 3809 @xcite ; akn  564 @xcite ; ngc  4051 @xcite ; pg  1404@xmath16 , pg  1440@xmath17 ( mkn 478 ) , and pg  1211@xmath18 @xcite ; ton  s180 @xcite ; 1h 0707 - 495 @xcite .",
    "further evidence for an ionized disk comes from the observation of fe k@xmath19 emission from ionized gas in numerous nlsy1s @xcite .",
    "thus examination of the sed of a nlsy1 , and comparison with that obtained for blsy1s should offer insight into the relative accretion rates across the seyfert population . to this end",
    ", we undertook a multi - wavelength campaign to obtain a broad - band spectral - energy - distribution of ton  s180 .",
    "we selected ton  s180 for study as it is bright in the soft x - ray regime and has low line - of - sight and intrinsic extinction , allowing a view of the bare continuum form .",

    "the source is at the extreme end of the seyfert range of line widths with fwhm h@xmath19 and h@xmath23 ^ -1 km s@xmath7 , making it a good choice for isolating the fundamental parameter which determines the classification of a seyfert galaxy .",

    "a standard technique calls for data with a deadtime - primbsching correction ( dpc ) factor @xmath44 1.25 to be discarded , as the systematic errors present in the estimates of this correction factor increase with its magnitude .",
    "however , during the course of reducing these data it was noted that the ds dpc factor frequently lay above 1.5 , significantly greater than the more typically observed values of 1.0 - 1.3 .",
    "this was likely due to increased geocoronal emission possibly associated with the approaching solar maximum at that epoch and/or the decreasing orbital altitude of the _ euve _ satellite .",

    "the peak of the sed in this case is 80 ev .",
    "the dotted green lines denote the uncertainty in the intrinsic sed , due to some uncertainty in the line - of - sight absorption measurement .",
    "parameterization of the soft x - ray regime as a steep power - law is clearly inadequate , and we also overlay an alternative model with continuum plus diskbb soft component .",
    "it is interesting to see that the best - fitting diskbb model , which has a temperature of 98 ev at the inner radius , does not predict any bbb component would appear in the uv band .",
    "even application of the physically meaningful models such as diskbb leave some unmodeled structure in the soft component , i.e.  a sharp spectral break below 0.3 kev .",
    "it is currently unclear whether this structure represents the intrinsic form of the soft x - ray emission or whether it represents a residual uncertainty in the acis / letg calibration .",
    "the break is not well modeled using neutral or ionized gas .",
    "the most obvious possibility remaining is that this sharp feature is due to the presence of emission features .",
    "however , uncertainty in calibration prompts us to note this structure but not to model it in detail .",
    "table  [ aox ] shows the indices between various wavebands for ton  s180 , compared to some values previously determined for other seyfert type galaxies .",
    "a commonly cited slope is @xmath93 , and the value @xmath94 derived for ton  s180 is consistent with @xmath95 found for a sample of optically - selected radio quiet agns @xcite .",
    "ton  s180 appears x - ray weak compared to the mean index of @xmath96 determined for the _ rosat _ international x - ray / optical survey ( rixos , @xcite ) however , ton  s180 does lie within the the broad range found for rixos sources , which include both blsy1s and nlsy1s .",
    "the value @xmath97 was defined in @xcite as the index linking 5500  and 1 kev , and ton  s180 lies within the broad ranges found for soft x - ray and hard x - ray selected agn from that study , based on _ rosat _ observations .",
    "there are two questions of interest here , one is whether nlsy1s as a class have systematically different interband indices to blsy1s , and the other is whether ton  s180 is unusual compared to other nlsy1s . @xcite",
    "have broached the first question by comparing the quantity @xmath93 for nlsy1s and blsy1s .",
    "those authors find average values and @xmath98 deviations @xmath99 and @xmath100 , thus concluding there to be no significant differences between this quantity for the two extremes of the seyfert 1 population , contrary to some previous results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary , based upon the comparison of interband indices with other studies yields no evidence that ton  s180 has an unusual ratio of optical / uv to x - ray flux .",
    "while opinions in the literature differ on whether there is a systematic difference in @xmath93 for the extremes of the seyfert 1 population , it seems clear that interband indices have large ranges and their use is best suited to comparison of large samples of sources . in this study",
    "we proceed by more detailed examination of the shape of the sed , and comparison of our data with other detailed seds .",
    "a sed for ton  s180 was first presented by @xcite , who found the soft x - ray component to contain the bulk of the energy in this seyfert galaxy .",
    "this campaign of observations provides a more complete sed for ton  s180 than previously available , with a large amount of simultaneous data .",
    "examination of the detailed energy distribution of ton  s180 reveals significant differences compared to some other well - studied agn .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the extinction - corrected sed of ton  s180 , and some parameterizations of its form .",
    "overlaid on the parameterizations of the sed of ton  s180 are the seds of other agn ; ngc  5548 is shown as a magenta dash - dotted line @xcite while the mean radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( from @xcite ) are shown as dotted black and dashed blue lines , respectively .",
    "the most immediate result is that the seds of the seyfert galaxies appear to peak somewhere in the extreme uv / soft x - ray band , while the quasars peak in the uv regime .",
    "furthermore , the sed of ton  s180 peaks at a higher energy than that of ngc  5548 .",
    "some caution is required in the comparison of seds constructed with different datasets and various assumptions .",
    "some apparent difference in seds could be an artifact of the assumption of some continuum form for the quasars , versus a simple joining of the soft x - ray to uv data for the seyferts .",
    "however , such assumptions are only necessary in the problematic regime between @xmath101  and @xmath36 0.1 kev .",
    "we find the evidence for true underlying differences between ton  s180 and the comparison sources to be strengthened by the absence of a contribution from the bbb in the uv band of ton  s180 .",
    "a standard optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk @xcite predicts the temperature of the peak of the disk spectrum @xmath102 to be a function of the mass of the central black hole and the accretion rate : @xmath103 @xcite , where @xmath104 is the radius , @xmath105 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath106 is the mass in units of @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the accretion rate in units of the eddington accretion rate .",
    "all other things being equal , a difference of two orders of magnitude in mass should yield a disk spectrum whose peak energy is a factor of 3 lower for the higher - mass system than the lower - mass system ; similarly , a factor 100 increase in accretion rate ( relative to the eddington rate ) shifts the peak to a factor 3 higher energy .",
    "thus the rqq sed ( figure  [ fig : sedmo ] ) represents sources radiating at substantially below the eddington accretion rate , and having a high central mass ; these yield a relatively cool disk spectrum . at the other extreme , nlsy1s",
    "are thought to be accreting close to the eddington limit , and have a low mass ; the disk spectrum appears hot .",
    "the blsy1 ngc  5548 represents an intermediate system in terms both of the accretion rate and central mass , and this appears to have an intermediate sed .",
    "@xcite find that for a sample of qsos , the entire continuum from 10 ev to 2 kev can be represented by a single power - law ; this is clearly not the case in ton  s180 where the x - ray spectrum steepens below 2 kev , and neither the soft or hard x - ray components extrapolate to meet the uv data in a satisfactory way .",
    "ngc  5548 has a central black hole mass estimated at @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "if the peak of the sed for ngc  5548 is close to the lyman limit ( @xmath110k ) then an accretion rate of 11% of eddington would be estimated , assuming a standard thin disk picture .",
    "few strong constraints exist on the central mass in ton  s180 .",
    "from variability observed in the x - ray regime @xcite found @xmath111 for ton  s180 ; however , those authors assumed a bolometric luminosity which is lower than that revealed by this sed , leading to a revised limit @xmath112 .",
    "mass estimates such as these can be misleading if the x - ray variability is due , for example , to flares on the surface of the accretion disk , as the timescale of variation may not be directly related to the scale - size of the disk system .",
    "thus we examine an alternative estimate of mass based upon the luminosity at 5100   ( @xmath113 ) . using the relation derived from other nlsy1s ( @xcite , their figure  7 ) we estimate a central mass @xmath114 ( with a factor @xmath115 uncertainty ) and the broad line region to exist at a radius @xmath116 light days ( @xcite , their figure  6 ) .",
    "this is in keeping with the systematically large blr radii suggested by @xcite for nlsy1s compared to blsy1s . as the level of starlight contamination of the 5100   flux is difficult to assess ,",
    "this mass should be considered as an upper limit on the true central mass .",
    "the difference in sed peak energies is thus expected , as ton  s180 has a lower mass than ngc  5548 , and nlsy1s are thought to have systematically higher accretion rates than blsy1s .",
    "unfortunately , the peak of the spectrum in ton  s180 remains loosely constrained .",
    "the _ euve _",
    "data favor the simple parameterization of the xuv spectrum ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) indicating that the peak lies close to or below 100 ev . assuming a standard disk spectrum ,",
    "the disk temperature must be greater than @xmath117ev , the peak of any cooler component of significant flux would show up in the _ fuse _ data .",
    "the sed data indicate a peak close to 100 ev . assuming a peak in disk emission for ton  s180 at this energy , which corresponds to @xmath118k , then for @xmath114 , @xmath119 . for black holes operating near the eddington limit the accretion disk surface is predicted to be highly ionized .",
    "there is certainly strong evidence for an ionized disk in ton  s180 , as the fe k@xmath19 line appears to be produced in highly ionized material in _",
    "bepposax _ @xcite and _ asca _ data @xcite .",
    "the results from ton  s180 appear to fit into the standard disk picture .",
    "however , we also note that @xcite conclude that the standard disk model is not applicable to the uv spectra of quasars .",
    "their case rests on the lack of any relation between @xmath120 and luminosity .",
    "however , since the peak of the disk spectrum is generally at rest wavelengths of 1000   or shorter @xcite , @xmath121 is indicative of only the rising edge of the disk spectrum . in the standard disk model",
    ", the spectral slope in this region is relatively insensitive to luminosity , so one does not necessarily expect a strong correlation between @xmath121 and luminosity of the bbb .    as a final note ,",
    "the lowest frequency ir point lies above the adjacent ir points .",
    "this has been observed in many agn and is due to thermal emission from dust grains heated to close to their evaporation temperature ( 1500 k for graphite ) close to the central engine @xcite .",
    "recently , strong near - ir emission from the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 7469 has been attributed to very hot dust grains ( @xmath122 k ) associated with the putative torus @xcite , this is also observed in the sed of ngc3783 @xcite .",
    "the multi - power - law parameterization of the sed for ton  s180 makes it possible to estimate the luminosity in various energy regimes , helping to constrain reprocessing mechanisms and isolate the primary energy source .",
    "table  [ enbudget ] shows the observed and intrinsic luminosities in several energy - bands , defined in the rest - frame of the source .",
    "the implied bolometric luminosity is @xmath123 .",
    "more luminosity emerges in the 10 - 100 ev regime than the 100 ev to 10 kev regime . assuming that we are seeing all emitted radiation in each wavelength regime",
    "then this indicates that the euve  soft x - ray band contains the primary spectral component , in keeping with disk - corona models ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the energy budget and the sed show that ton  s180 is relatively x - ray weak above @xmath115 kev ( interband indices are insensitive to this , as historically x - ray fluxes for comparison with optical fluxes have been taken at soft x - ray energies ) .",
    "one possible reason for this is compton - cooling of the hard spectrum by the large flux of soft x - ray and uv photons , as discussed by many authors , including @xcite .",
    "the weak absorption features detected in the _ fuse _   data , the absence of absorption from lower ionization species in the _ hst _ data , and the lack of detectable x - ray absorption in the _ chandra _ spectrum together indicate the presence of a small column of circumnuclear material which appears to be in a high state of ionization compared to that observed in other well - studied sources such as ngc  5548 and ngc  3783 .",
    "the outflow velocity of @xmath124 is not unusual .",
    "many seyfert galaxies have shown evidence for outflow in uv and optical data ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the x - ray regime _ chandra _ grating observations have revealed supporting evidence for outflowing gas , with velocities of order a few hundred @xmath125 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a picture of ton  s180 being shrouded by highly ionized gas is consistent with earlier bepposax @xcite and _ asca _",
    "@xcite observations of fe k@xmath19 emission , as well as the new _ asca _ data which show that the narrow component of fek@xmath19 is consistent with emission from .",
    "the ratio of the to absorbing columns in the uv regime is comparable to that of the high - ionization component detected in mrk  509 @xcite , which was tentatively identified with the x - ray warm absorber in that object .",
    "however , in ton  s180 the total equivalent column density of hydrogen associated with the uv absorber must be @xmath126 ; too low to produce detectable x - ray absorption .",
    "however , the absence of ionized circumnuclear gas does not appear to be a general property of nlsy1s .",
    "some nlsy1s do appear to show signatures of a warm absorber in the x - ray regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as uv absorption systems @xcite .    to examine the relation between the ionizing spectrum in ton  s180 and the circumnuclear gas , we took two estimates of the sed and total ionizing flux .",
    "the conservative estimate links the softest x - ray point at @xmath127 kev to the highest end of the uv data with a simple power - law . for this",
    "sed , the total luminosity from 0.01 - 10 kev is @xmath128 ergs s@xmath7 and the corresponding luminosity in ionizing photons is q @xmath129 photons s@xmath7 .",
    "taking instead the ( extreme ) sed that peaks in the euv ( green line in figure 7 ) , the 0.01  10 kev luminosity is @xmath130 erg s@xmath7 and q@xmath131 photons s@xmath7 .",
    "assuming the typical density and ionization parameter in the optical broad - line region ( blr ) clouds , the radii at which the blr exists can be estimated .",
    "@xcite used these `` photoionization radii '' and the measured line widths to derive black hole masses , which were in general agreement with those determined via reverberation mapping . in order to explore the role of luminosity on the line widths we instead use the masses derived from reverberation mapping and the photoionization radii ( @xmath132 ) to estimate the line widths .",
    "following @xcite , we assume @xmath133 for the line emitting gas .",
    "based on our estimates of the ionizing luminosity of the central source in ton  s180 , we derive representative radial distances of r @xmath134 cm and @xmath135 cm , for the conservative and extreme cases , respectively ( @xmath136 light days , somewhat smaller than the radius estimated from @xcite ) .",
    "if the blr clouds are virialized around the central black hole , the fwhm of the emission lines should be roughly equal to @xmath137 ; for a black hole mass of 10@xmath138 , fwhm @xmath36 1290 km s@xmath7 ( conservative case ) and 1160 km s@xmath7 ( extreme case ) , in reasonable agreement with the observed fwhm of h@xmath5 .",
    "we have estimated the total ionizing flux , q , for two blsy1 s : for ngc 4151 , q is @xmath36 28 @xmath139 photons s@xmath7 @xcite ; for ngc 5548 , q is @xmath140 photons s@xmath7 @xcite . assuming the black hole masses quoted by @xcite ( 1.2 x 10@xmath138 for ngc 4151 , and 6.8 x 10@xmath138 for ngc 5548 ) , the corresponding `` typical '' blr cloud distances and velocities are r @xmath141 cm and fwhm @xmath36 3700 km s@xmath7 for ngc 4151 , and r @xmath142 cm and fwhm @xmath36 7460 km s@xmath7 for ngc 5548 ; the fhwms are in rough agreement with the observed values .",
    "clearly , the narrowness of the emission lines in ton  s180 is partially due to its stronger ionizing flux .",
    "furthermore , given these `` typical '' blr conditions , it is likely that the clouds within a few light days of the central source are too highly ionized even to produce much emission ( for a discussion of range in conditions in which emission lines form , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the higher value of @xmath143 for ton  s180 requires that the blr gas is either more highly ionized than in blsy1s or , if the emission - line ratios are the same , it must be denser ( i.e. , denser gas is now ionized enough to contribute significantly to the emission - line spectrum ) . either way , conditions are not identical to those in typical blsy1s .",
    "construction of the spectral energy distribution for the bright nlsy1 galaxy ton  s180 shows that most of the energy is emitted in the 10  100 ev regime , indicating that the primary source of emission dominates that band .",
    "the uv and x - ray data together constrain the peak of any bbb component to lie between 15 and 100 ev .",
    "this , and the overall shape of the sed indicate that emission from the accretion disk peaks at significantly higher energies in this source than in blsy1s , as expected if nlsy1s have smaller central black holes and higher accretion rates .",
    "high - resolution spectra from _ fuse _",
    "reveal uv absorption due to .",
    "the absence of absorption features in the _ hst _ data and the lack of neutral hydrogen absorption in the _ fuse _ spectrum indicate a high - ionization state for the absorbing gas , while the absence of soft x - ray absorption that shows that the column density is quite low .",
    "the highly - ionized state of the circumnuclear gas is most likely linked to the high luminosity and steep slope of the ionizing continuum in ton  s180 .",
    "given our constraints on the sed in ton  s180 , we find that typical blr emission lines would form at a radius which is an order of magnitude further out than in typical blsy1s .",
    "the blr is estimated to exist at a radius @xmath144 cm , or 40 light days .",
