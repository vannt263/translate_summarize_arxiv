    "when the associated energy scales of these states fall well below that of magnetic interactions  @xcite , various perturbations including static  @xcite or dynamic  @xcite lattice effects may play a key role due to coupling between lattice and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "a recent neutron spin  echo ( nse ) examination of the pyrochlore slab antiferromagnet ( kagome bilayer ) srcr@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( scgo )  @xcite suggested that phonons affect the slow relaxation of this highly frustrated spin system .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , why phonons at 7  mev , and not other frequencies , drive magnetic relaxation is not clear and further investigation of phonons and related spin - phonon mechanisms is required . in this context",

    "phonon coupling alone could be the origin of the complex relaxational behavior .",
    "the systems studied are disordered due to the non - magnetic dilution that has been widely studied and is a known factor in the pyrochlore slab compounds  @xcite .",
    "it is even surprising that even though the phonon properties of the sgo / scgo lattices appear somewhat better defined when compared to the bszgo , it is in scgo that very strongly stretched time decay occurs .",
    "a complete microscopic picture of the relaxation process is still to be constructed and",
    "one can imagine that the fine details of the magnetic states of lowest energy are of major importance in such a pursuit .",
    "pursuing the analysis might be extremely difficult for systems like the pyrochlore slabs but in simpler cases details of spin - lattice coupling have been already examined and could pave the way for further work  @xcite . in the general context of frustrated magnetism our results point out a trend that has been already evoked , the low  temperature and ground  state properties are highly sensitive to system dependent perturbations .",
    "nevertheless the present work pinpoints the importance of lattice vibrations and their microscopic character in the control of the low  energy spin dynamics .     follows the experimental data on scgo over the range 3  k@xmath77  7  k as reported earlier  @xcite and is in that temperature range indiscernable from the model with cut - off at the same frequency , eq .",

    "we have presented a detailed investigation of the phonon spectra in the pyrochlore slab compounds srcr@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( scgo ) and ba@xmath3sn@xmath3zncr@xmath4ga@xmath5o@xmath6 ( bszcgo ) based on _ ab - initio _ lattice dynamics simulations , inelastic neutron scattering and raman measurements , in order to investigate the origin and mechanisms of the recently observed  @xcite phonon - driven magnetic relaxation in scgo .",
    "since the magnetic signal dominates the neutron scattering response at low energy transfer , we have performed new experiments on the isostructural non - magnetic material srga@xmath8o@xmath2 ( sgo ) . moreover , the chemical disorder is difficult to include in the ab - initio lattice dynamics calculations so these have also focussed on sgo .",
    "results of the calculations for the gdos and @xmath24 for sgo are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "neutron and raman experiments show the similarity of the phonon response in the magnetic system with respect to the non - magnetic counterpart .",
    "the calculated partial density of states for sgo indicates that the strongest contribution to the total density of states stems from the vibrations of the ga ",
    "atoms on the 2b and 12k sites of the lattice , associated with flat dispersion branches centered at the zone boundary m  point in the @xmath78-space .",
    "thus we conclude that the phonons response in scgo corresponding to that at the m  point in sgo comprises the partial contribution of the atoms residing on the 12k sites of the magnetic sub - lattice of scgo .",
    "the most relevant m - point modes have displacement vectors that modulate the distances between cr sites in the kagome layers of the pyrochlore slab and therefore can effectively couple with the magnetic moments .",
    "the activation energy for magnetic relaxation is equal to the position of the characteristic peak in the experimental gdos .",
    "calculated energies of two of the raman active @xmath14 -point modes are included in the energy range of this peak but they appear with less weight in the calculated gdos . + in comparison bszcgo , the other pyrochlore slab antiferromagnet shows a qualitatively different low  energy phonon response with an enhanced non - debye low  energy response .",
    "we suggest that the faster relaxation without a particular energy scale is a consequence of this circumstance , which we attribute to the particular ga / zn disorder present in this compound .",
    "future computational and theoretical work is called for to examine the interplay of magnetic interactions and the microscopic mechanisms associated with specific phonon displacements for better understanding of the reported phenomena .                                    , , , , ,",
