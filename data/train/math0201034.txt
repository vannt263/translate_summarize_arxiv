    "this paper addresses two problems in 4manifold theory . the first concerns the computation of 4dimensional diffeomorphism invariants . ever since the introduction of donaldson invariants in the early 1980 s , efforts to calculate diffeomorphism invariants centered upon large classes of smooth manifolds that have some additional structure .",
    "one such class of manifolds thought to have promise was 4manifolds with effective circle actions , but the extra structure given by such manifolds turned out to be insufficient for calculating donaldson invariants .    with the introduction of seiberg  witten invariants in 1994 ,",
    "old problems were revisited with new hope .",
    "s.  donaldson showed how to calculate the seiberg ",
    "witten invariants in the simplest case where the 4manifold was a product of a 3manifold and a circle @xcite . in 1997",
    "t. mrowka , p. ozvath , and b. yu @xcite , and simultaneously l. nicolaescu @xcite , studied the 3dimensional seiberg ",
    "witten equations of seifert  fibered spaces . in 2001 , seiberg  witten invariants for manifolds with free and fixed point free circle actions were calculated in @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we finish this line of research by calculating the seiberg ",
    "witten invariants for @xmath1manifolds with fixed points .",
    "we prove :    if x is a smooth , closed , oriented 4manifold with @xmath0 and admits a circle action which has at least one fixed point , then the seiberg ",
    "witten invariant vanishes for all @xmath2 structures.[thm:1 ]    when the action on @xmath3 is free , the quotient of the @xmath1action is a smooth , closed 3manifold @xmath4 . in this case",
    "@xmath5 can be thought of as a unit circle bundle of a complex line bundle over @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath5 with the given circle action is specified by the quotient @xmath4 and the euler class @xmath6 of the line bundle .    a fixed point free circle action will have nontrivial isotropy groups , forcing the orbit space to be an orbifold rather than a manifold . as in the free case , a manifold with a fixed point free @xmath1action",
    "can still be considered a unit circle bundle , but it is furthermore a principal @xmath1bundle of an orbifold line bundle over a @xmath7dimensional orbifold . in this setup , @xmath8 is replaced by the group @xmath9 which records local data around the singular set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the manifold @xmath5 with given @xmath1action is then determined by the orbifold @xmath4 and the euler class of the orbifold line bundle which is now an element of @xmath9 .    manifolds which admit",

    "likewise , the existence of such a sphere in a symplectic 4manifold implies that the manifold is rational or ruled @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ lem : main ] relies heavily upon r. fintushel s foundational work on 4manifolds with @xmath1actions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "every such 4manifold @xmath34 has a quotient 3manifold @xmath4 together with the following data ( altogether called a legally weighted 3manifold @xmath4 ) :    1 .   a finite collection of weighted arcs and circles in @xmath35 .",
    "2 .   a finite set of isolated fixed points in @xmath35 disjoint from the sets of ( 1 ) .",
    "a class ( the `` euler class '' ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the union of @xmath38 , points of ( 2 ) , and arcs of ( 1 ) .",
    "the endpoints of weighted arcs are fixed points and there may be a finite set of fixed points in the interior of a weighted arc or circle .",
    "to each component of an arc or circle that runs between two fixed points ( without passing through another fixed point ) one assigns a weight which records the local isotropy data of the circle action .",
    "if a weighted circle does not contain any fixed points , it is called _ simply  weighted _ ; otherwise it is _ multiply ",
    "weighted_.    to each component of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) there is an associated index which is simply the euler number of the principal @xmath1bundle over the boundary of a tubular neighborhood of the component .",
    "similarly , an index can be given to each boundary component ( see section 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the sum of the indices of all of the components is equal to 0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 380 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 act smoothly on a simply connected 4manifold @xmath5 , and suppose the quotient space @xmath39 is not a counterexample to the 3dimensional poincar conjecture .",
    "then @xmath5 is a connected sum of copies of @xmath40 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath41 .",
    "[ thm : fintushel ]    we can already use this result to prove theorem [ thm:1 ] when @xmath5 is simply connected . in that case",
    ", @xmath5 is the equivariant connect sum of two @xmath42 pieces where one of the quotient spaces is @xmath43 .",
    "thus there is a @xmath28 or @xmath41 summand in that piece with an essential embedded sphere of nonnegative square , as required .",
    "we are now ready to generalize this idea .",
    "let @xmath5 be a smooth , closed 4manifold with a smooth @xmath1action whose quotient is a legally weighted 3manifold @xmath4 .",
    "first we show how to reduce to the case where there are no multiply  weighted circles in @xmath4 .",
    "suppose @xmath4 contains a multiply  weighted circle @xmath44 with 3 or more fixed points .",
    "note that @xmath44 could represent a nontrivial class in @xmath45 or be embedded in @xmath4 nontrivially as in figure [ fig : weightedorbit1 ] .",
    "in this situation @xmath5 can be decomposed into an equivariant connect sum of two 4manifolds @xmath46 , both with circle actions .",
    "the weighted orbit space of @xmath47 is the same as before except the weighted circle @xmath44 has exactly two fixed points ; the weighted orbit space of @xmath48 is @xmath43 with a trivially embedded multiply  weighted circle with the original weights ( figure [ fig : weightedorbit2 ] ) .",
    "the equivariant connect sum is performed by removing the preimage of a @xmath49 neighborhood of the fixed point between the weights @xmath50 and @xmath51 from both @xmath47 and @xmath48 and then gluing equivariantly along the @xmath43 boundary .",
    "and we can further assume each @xmath54 decomposes into connect sums of @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath55 , or @xmath40 by theorem [ thm : fintushel ] .",
    "if any of the @xmath54 s have a @xmath28 or @xmath41 factor , then @xmath5 has an essential embedded sphere of nonnegative square .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath5 decomposes into @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "if there is an essential sphere of nonnegative square in @xmath47 , then such a sphere survives in any of its blowups .",
    "hence it is enough to find a sphere of nonnegative square in @xmath47 .",
    "we can get rid of the multiply  weighted circle in @xmath47 using p. pao s `` replacement trick '' @xcite .",
    "he noticed that the same 4manifold often admits many different @xmath1actions and showed how to replace a complicated circle action with a simpler one .",
    "let @xmath5 be a 4manifold with an @xmath1action whose weighted orbit space @xmath4 contains a weighted circle @xmath44 with exactly two fixed points .",
    "then @xmath5 admits a different @xmath1action whose weighted orbit spaces is either @xmath4 with @xmath44 replaced with a pair of isolated fixed points or @xmath59 with c removed from the collection of weighted circles .",
    "[ lem : pao ]    thus we can work with @xmath47 , rename it @xmath5 , and assume it has only boundary components , weighted arcs , isolated fixed points , or simply  weighted circles .",
    "if there are two or more boundary components in the quotient , the preimage of an arc that runs from one boundary component to another boundary component is an essential sphere of square zero ; so we may reduce to the case where @xmath4 has only one boundary component .",
    "this case can be eliminated using a short argument in the lemma below .",
    "thus we only need to consider @xmath1manifolds @xmath5 with weighted arcs , isolated fixed points , and simply  weighted circles .",
    "isotope the arcs and fixed points into a smooth ball @xmath60 and enclose them by a sphere @xmath61 . since the sum of the indices of the components is 0 , the euler class of the preimage of the sphere in @xmath5 is zero , i.e. , we can realize @xmath5 as the fiber sum of two manifolds @xmath62 and @xmath63 by      where the orbit space of @xmath63 contains all of the weighted arcs and isolated fixed points .",
    "the quotient of @xmath62 contains no fixed points but it could still have complicated topology .",
    "@xmath63 is a simply connected 4manifold with an @xmath1 action and quotient @xmath43 , so it is diffeomorphic to a connect sum of @xmath40 s , @xmath28 s , @xmath30 s , and @xmath65 s by theorem [ thm : fintushel ] .",
    "we can in fact build @xmath63 by starting with a circle action on @xmath40 with two fixed points and equivariantly connect summing the other factors .",
    "this may be yet a different @xmath1action , but the resulting manifold is still diffeomorphic to @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath63 is simply connected , any two embedded circles are isotopic ; hence the fiber sum of @xmath62 with @xmath63 along @xmath66 using the new @xmath1action will still be diffeomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "once again we can eliminate all connect sum factors of @xmath63 except for the @xmath40 we started with .",
    "thus we have reduced the problem to finding an essential sphere of nonnegative square in @xmath67 where the quotient of @xmath40 has 2 fixed points .",
    "note that @xmath5 is a 4manifold with an @xmath1action , @xmath68 , and 2 isolated fixed points @xmath69 .",
    "because the sum of the indices is zero , one of the fixed points comes with a @xmath70 index and the other comes with a @xmath71 index .",

    "we have that @xmath75 .",
    "hence @xmath45 in the long exact sequence of the pair @xmath76 is nonzero : @xmath77 since @xmath78 there exists a 1cycle in @xmath79 represented by a closed loop @xmath80 which is not a multiple of the euler class @xmath81 of the action .",

    "the preimage of both of these arcs is a sphere of self  intersection 0 .",
