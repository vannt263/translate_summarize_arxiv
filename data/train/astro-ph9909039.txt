    "in addition , the best - fit power - law photon index @xmath20 is 0.2 , much harder than expected .",
    "this spectral shape is similar to that obtained towards the end of the short - on state , or in the low - state by o99 where the effects of significant absorption are clearly seen as a change in spectral shape and increased curvature in the 13 kev energy range implying absorption of @xmath21@xmath22  atom  @xmath3 .",

    "partial covering of the  spectrum is also required during the late phases of the short - on state ( o99 ) , during the 1993 anomalous low - state ( vrtilek et al .",

    "thus , the anomalous low - state spectrum observed here is indistinguishable from that observed during the more commonly occurring low - state .",

    "a similar occurrence is evident in the case of the 1993 anomalous low - state ( see vrtilek et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while the 1983 anomalous low - state appears to occur close to the end of an extended interval of spin - down .",
    "these measurements therefore strengthen the link between intervals of spin - down and the occurrence of anomalous low - states .    several pulsars exhibit transitions between intervals of spin - down and spin - up ( e.g. , bildsten et al .",
    "van kerkwijk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) propose that this behavior results from the accretion disk becoming warped to the extent that the inner region becomes tilted by @xmath6@xmath36 , resulting in a retrograde flow and a spin - down torque .",
    "this model implies that when spinning - down the x - ray source would be mostly observed _ through _ the accretion disk .",
    "this is unlikely to produce a simple increase in absorption since the inner disk regions are likely to be substantially ionized and scattering may play an important role .",
    "support for this model comes from observations of the 7.7  s pulsar 4u1626 - 67 . during spin - up",
    "the power - law spectrum has @xmath37 while during spin - down @xmath38 ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "the spin - down spectrum can also be fit using a partial covering model with 0.86 of the flux obscured by @xmath39  atom  @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the 4u1626 - 67 spectral hardening and torque reversals are remarkably similar to those observed here from  suggesting a common mechanism .",
    "this implies that anomalous low - states may result from an unusually large amount of warp in the  accretion disk .",
    "since the accretion disk partially shadows hz  her from the x - ray source , this change may produce a noticeable effect in the optical and uv spectra of hz  her ."
