    "massive stars play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies , as they are the primary source of metals , and they dominate the turbulent energy input into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by their massive and fast stellar winds , by the ultraviolet radiation , and by supernova explosions .",
    "the radiation field of these stars , at first , photo - dissociates the ambient molecular gas and forms a so - called photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) of neutral hydrogen .",
    "subsequently , the lyman continuum photons of the star ionize the gas and produce a region that expands into the neutral ambient medium .",
    "as these stars have short lifetimes of only a few million years , regions indicate the sites of star formation ( sf ) and are targets to measure the current sf rate in a galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the emission line spectrum produced by the ionized gas allows the accurate determination of the current chemical composition of the gas in a galaxy .",
    "although the physical processes of the line excitation are quite well understood and accurate atomic data are available , so that the spectral analysis of regions ( see e.g. @xcite ) serves as an essential tool to study the evolution of galaxies , their reliability as diagnostic tool have also to be studied with particular emphasis e.g.  to temperature fluctuations ( @xcite ) and line excitations .",
    "the simple concept of a uniform medium in ionization equilibrium with the radiation from a massive star ( the strmgren sphere ) is successful in describing several global features of regions and allows to model the emission line spectrum to a first - order reliability . since it has long been realized that regions are also excerting complex dynamics to the ism , dynamical modelling of regions caused purely by the energy deposit of the stellar radiation field has therefore been started already long ago ( see e.g @xcite and references therein ) providing a first insight into the formation of dynamical structures .",
    "in addition , also an expanding stellar wind bubble ( swb ) with a constant wind power but neglecting its dynamics can be analytically described for the adiabatic phase as the self - similar evolution by sedov .        in order to approach reality of how a radiation - driven and wind - blown swb around a massive star interacts with its surroundings",
    "one has to take the kinetic energy of the wind and its dissipation into account and has to consider the ionization of the neutral environmental gas where it still exists .",
    "analytically , this can be allowed for in spherical symmetry under the simplifying assumptions of a point source of constant strong wind that interacts with a homogeneous ambient ism as derived by @xcite .",
    "this leads to a clear stratification of the surrounding bubble ( see fig .",
    "1 ) from inside out : freely expanding stellar wind , reverse shock , shocked stellar wind , contact discontinuity , swb forward shock , photo - ionized region , ionization front , forward - shocked ambient gas .",
    "although the analytical and semi - analytical solutions for the evolution of swbs have been improved over the years as well as the numerical simulations have been done with increasing complexity , like e.g.  2d calculations of swbs ( see e.g. by @xcite and a series of papers ) and/or combined 1d radiation - hydrodynamical models of regions coupled with the dynamical swb ( for references see freyer et al .",
    "2003 ) a variety of physical effects remains to be included in order to achieve a better agreement of models and observations e.g. with regard to the evolution of the hot phase in bubbles ( @xcite ) .",
    "to improve the insight into the evolution of radiation - driven + wind - blown bubbles around massive stars , we have performed a series of radiation - hydrodynamical simulations with a 2d cylindrical - symmetric nested - grid scheme for stars of masses 15 ( kroeger et al . in prep . ) , 35 ( @xcite ) , 60 ( @xcite ) , and 85 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main issues of these models can be summarized as follows :        \\1 ) the regions formed around the swbs have complex structures mainly affected by dynamical processes , such as shell instabilities , vortices , mixing effects , etc .",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 )    \\2 ) the stronger the wind the higher the compresssion of the swb - surrounding region ( @xcite ) , what means that the rgion does not increase according to the larger ionizing flux .",
    "\\3 ) finger - like and spiky structures of different densities and temperatures are formed in the photo - ionized region ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\4 ) the regions contributing to the region emission line spectrum are not solely limited to the photo - ionized shell around the swb but also form from photo - evaporated gas at the trailing surface of the swb shock front ( @xcite ; and see fig .",
    "\\5 ) because dispersion of this cooler photo - evaporated gas into the hot swb leads to mixing also the stellar material expelled by the wind has to emerge partly in the region spectra .",
    "\\6 ) as a consequence the metal - enrichment of the wind in the wolf - rayet stage which is generally assumed to remain only in the hot swb for a long time affects the observationally discernible abundance of the gas . by these models",
    "@xcite could prove for the first time that the metal release by wolf - rayet stars can be mixed within short timescales from the hot swb into the warm ionized gas and should become observationally accessible .",
    "as the extreme case for the 85 star we found a 22% enhancement of carbon , but neglible amouts for n and o.    since the occurrence of a wr phase is strongly metal dependent , the enrichment with c should also depend on the average metallicity .",
    "this would mean that any radial gradient of c abundance of regions in galactic disks is steeper than that of o. and indeed , @xcite ( 2005 ) found d@xmath1(c / o)]/dr = @xmath2 for the galactic disk .",
    "\\7 ) as expected from the distribution of gas the radially projected brightness shows a decrease to the center and a slight brightening to the limb but not as strong as expected according to the increase of the line - of - sight with impact parameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this effect depends on the bubble age and evolves from central brightning to a moderate central trough .",
    "it also demonstrates both : the neglection of heat conduction and the homogeneous initial density do not allow a sufficient brightning of heat conductive interfaces so that , secondly , only the photo - evaporated backflow can contribute to the luminosity in present models . in reality , condensations which become embedded into the hot swb are exposed to heat conduction .",
    "\\8 ) the sweep - up of the slow red supergiant wind by the fast wolf - rayet wind produces remarkable morphological structures and emission signatures which agree well with observed x - ray luminosity and temperature as well as with the limb brightening of the radially projected x - ray intensity profile ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "\\9 ) connected to 1 ) the higher compression of the pushed region leads to a stronger recombination and , by this , a higher energy loss by means of collisionaly excited line emission .",
    "this means that the energy transfer efficiencies s for both radiative as well as kinetic energies remain much lower than analytically derived ( more than one order of magnitude ) and amount to only a few per mil ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is almost no dependence on the stellar mass what contrasts expectations because the energy impact by lyman continuum photons and by wind luminosity increase with stellar mass .",
    "vice versa , since the gas compression is stronger by a more energetic wind also the energy loss by radiation is more efficient .",
    "nonetheless , words of caution and unfortunately of discouragement have to be expressed here with respect to various aspects :    at first , the stellar evolutionary models are not yet unique but depend on the authors . in order to get a quantifiable comparison of the models by garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) with our 2d radiation - hydrodynamical simulations ( freyer et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) for the 35 and 60 studies we used the same stellar parameters . since no stellar parameters were available from the same group for the 15 and 85 models we had to make use of the geneva models ( @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of the age - dependent parameters between the langer and the geneva 60 models ( fig .",
    "3 ) has revealed enormous differences in the energetics by almost one order of magnitude as well as that the wolf - rayet and luminous blue variable stages occur in contrary sequence , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , as presented by george meynet ( this conference ) the role of stellar rotation was until recently totally underestimated , mainly , because of a lack of model insights . in principle , the radiation - driven stellar wind is smaller at the equator of a rotating star with respect to the poles due to van zeippel s theorem , while in contrast the centrifugal - driven amount should increase .",
    "in addition , the radial and azimuthal redistribution of fresh fuel and already burned material in the stellar interior is uncertain as long as at least 2d stellar evolutionary models are lacking .",
    "hirschi et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) showed that taking stellar rotation into account in the geneva stellar evolution code increases the yields for heavy elements by a factor of @xmath3 for stars between @xmath4 .",
    "for the more massive stars rotation raises the yields of @xmath5 and other h - burning products like @xmath6 , but the yields of he - burning products like @xmath7 are smaller .",
    "additionally , for stars with @xmath8 , the evolution differs from that of non - rotating stars by the following manner : rotating stars enter the wr regime already in the course of their main - sequence .",
    "nevertheless , the wr phase has to be treated in the context of fully self - consistent evolutionary models with meridional circulations .    already in non - rotating models for metallicities less than solar two effects",
    "reduce the heavy element release by wr stars : first , the lower the metallicity the more massive a star has to be to evolve through the wr stages",
    ". therefore , the number of wr stars decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "schaller et al . (",
    "1992 ) found that with metallicity @xmath9 the minimal initial h - zams mass for a wr star is @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "the minimal initial mass is @xmath12 .",
    "second , the lower the metallicity the shorter are the wr lifetimes , and not all wr stages are reached . at solar metallicity wr stars enter all three wr stages ( wnl , wne , wc ) , whereas at @xmath9 only the wnl phase is reached ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wr lifetime of an @xmath13 star , e.g. , is @xmath14 at @xmath9 and @xmath15 at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .    at third ,",
    "the quiescent sf as a self - regulated process is a widely accepted concept . the stellar feedback can adapt both signs , positive as a triggering mechanism in a self - propagating manner like in superbubble shells vs. negative as self - regulation . primarily the correlation between the surface density of disk galaxies gas and the vertically integrated sf rate derived from the flux ( @xcite ) serves as the best proof of a sf self - regulation .",
    "such self - regulation is a plausible process due to the energy release mainly by massive stars as demonstrated by @xcite , whereas its level of the sf rate is determined by the deposit of the released energy to the ism .",
    "while the windless i.e. purely photo - ionizing models and analytical results e.g. by @xcite reach about one percent for the energy transfer efficiency  ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the radiation - dirven + wind - blown models by us fall short by more than one order of magnitude even to below 0.1 percent .    as a further aspect , the two - dimensionality of the numerical treatment must be overcome to 3d in order to allow for a proper description of turbulent eddies and small - scale inhomogeneities . in addition",
    "this requires also a change in the spatial resolution of the numerical code : the nested - grid strategy has to be changed to a flexible mesh adaptivity ( adaptive mesh refinement : amr ) .",
    "this approach was already developed by rijkhorst et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the publicly available and widely used amr code flash .",
    "last but not least , massive stars are born in ob associations with separations such low that their wind - driven regions should overlap . for observations",
    "these colliding swbs should produce a higher x - ray luminosity than expected from individual massive swbs .",
    "recent x - ray observations of hot gas even in the orion complex ( @xcite ) support this expectation .",
    "the modelling of such star - forming regions is highly complex , necessarily 3d , and requires inherently amr .",
    "only those explorations will enable us to answer the problem of timescales and energetics necessary for the observed gas evacuation of star clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "as one recognizes we are still in the natal phase of understanding and modelling structure and evolution of massive stars and their influence on the ambient ism .",
    "much before the end of this 21@xmath0 century revolutionary observational results and numerical models will enlighten our present - day ignorance .",
