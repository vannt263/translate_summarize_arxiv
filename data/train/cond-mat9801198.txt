    "since their first synthesis in the late 1970s , @xcite the ( tmtsf)@xmath0 family of linear - chain organic conductors , and the closely related tmttf family , has attracted continual attention . while the various broken symmetry ground states , including spin density waves , charge density waves , spin peierls , and even superconductivity have been extensively explored over the last two decades , @xcite much of the current attention is now focused on the metallic state .",
    "these compounds have become one of the prototypical testing grounds for the study of the effects of electron  electron interactions in one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures . in a strictly 1d interacting electron system , the fermi liquid ( fl ) state",
    "is replaced by a state in which interactions play a crucial role , and which is generally referred to as a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) .",
    "fortunately , well defined techniques to treat such interactions exist in one dimension , and the physical properties of the tll are well characterized and understood .",
    "@xcite it is thus crucial to know how well the properties of the organic conductors are described by this tll theory .",
    "the answer to this question is not clear from the outset because of the _ quasi_-one - dimensional nature of the compounds . due to interchain",
    "hopping , or interchain electron  electron or electron  phonon interactions , such materials are never strictly one - dimensional .",
    "in particular , although one expects the 1d theory to hold at high temperature , at lower temperatures the interchain hopping is expected to drive the system toward a more isotropic ( 2d or 3d ) behavior .",
    "these compounds are thus ideal candidates for a study of the dimensionality crossover between a non - fermi liquid regime ( tll in this case ) and a more conventional fermi liquid state . whether or not the low temperature phase is a fl , and the value of the expected crossover temperature , are issues which have been widely debated .",
    "questions have also been raised about the importance of the interactions , due particularly to the important success of simple mean - field theories in explaining the properties of the low temperature condensed phases .    in the materials which we discuss in this paper , the bechgaard salts ,",
    "charge transfer of one electron from every two tmtsf molecules leads to a quarter - filled ( or half - filled due to dimerization ) hole band , thus enhancing the importance of umklapp scattering .",
    "such a state would be a mott insulator in one dimension .",
    "as pointed out above , however , these materials are only quasi - one - dimensional , having two different finite interchain hopping integrals in the two transverse directions .",
    "such an interchain coupling , however , becomes ineffective at high enough temperatures or frequencies , and thus we would expect the 1d physics to dominate in this regime . while in many of these materials the high temperature dc conductivity has an essentially metallic character ,",
    "the finite frequency response is distinctly non - drude .    in this paper",
    "we report on measurements of the electrodynamic response of three members of the ( tmtsf)@xmath0 family of charge - transfer salts ( @xmath1  =  pf@xmath2 , asf@xmath2 , and clo@xmath3 ) , with the goal of studying the nature of the metallic state in these quasi-1d conductors . in this regime ,",
    "all three compounds exhibit behavior which can not be described as the response of a simple drude metal .",
    "in particular , two distinct features appear in the optical conductivity @xmath6 , one at zero frequency and one at finite frequency . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expt ] we discuss the sample growth techniques along with the experimental methods and results . theoretical analysis of both modes which appear in the conductivity is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : disclut ] we conclude with a discussion of the experimental and theoretical results and the implications of our findings with regard to an understanding of the dynamics of quasi-1d systems .    a number of previous studies have investigated the electrodynamic response of various bechgaard salts , but all covered only a portion of the spectral range presented in this paper , thus giving only a partial description of the complete response of these systems .",
    "@xcite in addition , the small size of crystals previously available precluded the use of single crystals at all but the highest frequencies . as a result , all of the earlier work was done on composite samples , mosaics formed by aligning multiple crystals next to each other in order to produce an optical face .",
    "indeed , our own initial work on these compounds was done in this way as well .",
    "@xcite however , as will be presented below , we have recently developed a method of growing single crystals of the bechgaard salts with large transverse dimensions , yielding samples with appreciable optical faces in the _ a - b _ plane .",
    "consequently , unlike any previous work , the results presented in this paper were all obtained on _ single crystals _ , even at the lowest frequencies .",
    "this has allowed us to avoid all of the complications and spurious results arising from the mosaic samples .",
    "many of the measurements presented here were made possible by our ability to grow large single crystals of the bechgaard salts .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the electronic structure tends to lead to long needle - like crystals , with typical transverse dimensions of less than 0.5 mm . in order to perform high quality optical measurements",
    "it is necessary to have large crystal faces .",
    "this was historically obtained by aligning multiple needle - like crystals into mosaics .",
    "this method introduced uncertainty into the measurements due to misalignment of the crystals , gaps between the crystals , and diffraction effects from the composite sample .",
    "the large single crystals used in this study were grown by the standard electrochemical growth technique,@xcite but at reduced temperature ( @xmath7c ) and at low current densities .",
    "these conditions produce a slow growth rate and , over period of four to six months , single crystals up to @xmath8  mm@xmath9 .",
    "these large , high - quality crystal faces in the _ a  b@xmath10 _",
    "plane allowed us to perform reliable measurements of the electrodynamic response of these materials both parallel ( @xmath11 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath12 ) to the highly conducting chain axis down to low frequencies .",
    "the use of such crystals led to significant enhancement of the accuracy obtained for the optical reflectivity . in this paper",
    "we will focus on our results along the chains , some of which have been published previously.@xcite our findings regarding the conductivity perpendicular to the chains have been presented , @xcite and will be discussed further in a future publication .",
    "@xcite      by combining the results from various different spectrometers in the microwave , millimeter , submillimeter , infrared , optical , and ultraviolet frequency ranges , we have obtained the electrodynamic response of these bechgaard salts over an extremely broad range ( 0.110@xmath13  @xmath4 ) . in the optical range from 15  @xmath4 to @xmath14  @xmath4 standard polarized reflectance measurements were performed employing four spectrometers with overlapping frequency ranges .",
    "two grating spectrometers were employed at the highest frequencies : a mcpherson spectrometer in the ultraviolet , and a home - made spectrometer based on a zeiss monochromator in the visible . in the infrared spectral range",
    "two fourier transform interferometers were used with a gold mirror as the reference . from the far - infrared up to the mid - infrared a fast scanning bruker ifs48pc spectrometer was employed , while in the far - infrared we also made use of a bruker ifs113v spectrometer with a mercury arc lamp source and a helium - cooled germanium bolometric detector .    in the submillimeter spectral range ( 813  @xmath4 ) , we have used a coherent source spectrometer @xcite based on backward wave oscillators , @xcite high power , tunable , monochromatic light sources with a broad bandwidth .",
    "these oscillators operate at frequencies below those accessed by a typical infrared spectrometer , and above the millimeter wave range , thus filling in an admittedly narrow , but important , gap in energy between these two more widely studied regions .",
    "this spectrometer was originally designed for transmission measurements and we have reconfigured it for reflection measurements on highly conducting bulk samples .",
    "the reflection coefficient is obtained by comparing the signals reflected from the sample and from a polished aluminum reference mirror , where the reflectivity of aluminum was calculated from the dc conductivity @xmath15 by the hagen - rubens relation@xcite @xmath16 this expression is valid for @xmath17 .    at all frequencies up to and including the mid - infrared , we placed the samples in an optical cryostat and measured the reflectivity as a function of temperature between 5k and 300k . in the case of ( tmtsf)@xmath18pf@xmath2 these reflectivity data were combined with previous measurements in the microwave and millimeter wave spectral range @xcite which were made by the use of a resonant cavity perturbation technique.@xcite in this method , the surface impedance @xmath19 of the material can be measured by placing a needle shaped crystal in an anti - node of either the electric or magnetic field of a cylindrical cavity in the te@xmath20 mode and measuring the change in width ( @xmath21 ) and center frequency ( @xmath22 ) of the resonance .",
    "it is then possible to calculate both the surface resistance @xmath23 and the surface reactance @xmath24 as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26  s / cm is the impedance of free space ( @xmath27 in si units ) .",
    "the resonator constant @xmath28 can be calculated from the geometry of the cavity and the sample .",
    "@xcite    the complex conductivity ( @xmath29 ) can be calculated from the surface impedance using @xmath30 , and the absorptivity @xmath31 is given by the relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reflectivity .",
    "in the limit @xmath34 , eq .  ( [ eq : mw - abs ] ) reduces to @xmath35 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mw - abs - hr ] ) it is possible to combine these microwave and millimeter wave cavity data with all of the higher frequency reflectivity data . in general",
    ", the reflectivity is a complex function @xmath36 .",
    "the reflectivity @xmath33 which we measure is actually the square of this quantity , @xmath37 . in order to obtain the phase @xmath38",
    "we have performed a kramers - kronig analysis on the reflectivity spectra : @xcite @xmath39 } - \\ln{[r(\\omega)]}}{\\omega^2 - x^2}dx , \\label{kk}\\ ] ] where the @xmath40}$ ] term has been added to the standard form in order to remove the singularity at @xmath41 .",
    "it has no effect on the integral because @xmath42 .",
    "because this integral extends from zero to infinity , it is necessary to make suitable high and low frequency extrapolations to the measured reflectivity data .",
    "we have chosen to use a power law at high frequencies ( @xmath43 ) and a hagen - rubens extrapolation , as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hr ] ) , to zero frequency . from @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "it is then possible to calculate the components of the complex optical conductivity @xmath46 .",
    "the dc resistivities of the bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath0 ( @xmath1=pf@xmath2 , asf@xmath2 , clo@xmath3 ) measured along their highly conducting chain axes exhibit metallic temperature dependence at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite in addition , all three compounds exhibit a sharp phase transition near 10  k , and a thermally activated behavior of the resistivity below this temperature .",
    "it has been established that the ground state in each of these materials is a spin density wave ( sdw ) , @xcite with transition temperatures of 12k for the pf@xmath2 and asf@xmath2 compounds , and 6k for clo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite the insulating behavior results from an opening of a gap in the single particle excitation spectrum at the fermi level due to electron",
    " electron interactions .",
    "figures  [ fig : pf6-as][fig : clo4-as ] show the measured absorptivities as a function of frequency at various temperatures for each of the compounds , and the conductivities calculated by use of the kramers - kronig relation , as described above . unlike the response of a simple metal , the frequency dependent conductivities of these compounds can not be described by a single drude term of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dc conductivity , @xmath49 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath50 is the scattering rate of the carriers with bandmass @xmath51 and number density @xmath52 .",
    "instead the spectrum exhibits two distinct features .",
    "the high dc conductivities are associated with a very narrow mode , centered at zero energy ( ze ) .",
    "in addition there is a second finite energy ( fe ) excitation centered near 200  @xmath4 .",
    "the combined spectral weight of these two modes is given by @xmath53 and leads to a total plasma frequency @xmath54 .",
    "as is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : pf6-as]b , this total spectral weight is independent of temperature , as is expected .",
    "in addition , the value is in full agreement with that obtained from the known carrier concentration @xmath55 and a bandmass @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig : pf6-as]b also demonstrates that most of the spectral weight resides in the finite energy mode , with only about 1% in the zero energy mode , independent of temperature .",
    "this value can be calculated in two ways .",
    "the contribution of the finite energy mode can be subtracted from the conductivity , and the remaining zero energy mode can be integrated .",
    "this approach gives @xmath57 .",
    "alternately , the zero crossing of the dielectric constant , when corrected for the higher frequency contributions from the finite energy mode , gives a plasma frequency of approximately @xmath58 , at all temperatures where this mode is clearly defined .",
    "@xcite this rather unusual two - structure response is the focus of the work presented here .",
    "we discuss the structure and possible origins of these two excitations separately in the following sections , although it is our belief that they result from the same underlying interactions within these materials .",
    "before turning to the various excitations observed in the optical spectrum , we discuss the overall features : the appearance of both a zero - energy and finite - energy excitation , with most of the spectral weight associated with the latter .",
    "this unusual behavior of the conductivity makes it unlikely that it can be described by a conventional explanation in terms of a weakly interacting ( or fermi liquid - like ) description.@xcite such a description would hardly be consistent with the fact that @xmath59 of the spectral weight is contained in the finite frequency mode around 200  @xmath4 .    in order to analyze this structure",
    "one has to remember that the ( tmtsf)@xmath0 family is a good realization of a quasi - one - dimensional electron system with some hopping between chains , and to compare the behavior of two isostructural groups of organic conductors , the ( tmttf)@xmath0 and ( tmtsf)@xmath0 salts . the ( tmtsf)@xmath0 salts have a larger interchain hopping than the ( tmttf)@xmath0 salts due to the larger overlap of the molecular orbitals in the direction perpendicular to the chains .",
    "various estimates of the transfer integrals in the tmtsf family lead to the following values along the three directions : @xcite @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 = 250mev , 25mev , 1mev .",
    "although the chains are coupled by an interchain hopping @xmath63 , such an interchain coupling becomes ineffective at high temperatures or frequencies , and above a certain energy scale @xmath64 the system possesses a one - dimensional character . the naive value for @xmath65 is @xmath66 , but interactions can renormalize this value downwards , leading to a wider one - dimensional regime.@xcite    in both cases , due to full charge transfer from the organic molecule to the counter ions , the tmttf or tmtsf stacks have a quarter - filled hole band .",
    "there is also a moderate dimerization , which is somewhat more significant for the tmttf family .",
    "therefore , depending on the importance of this dimerization , the band can be described as either half - filled ( for a strong dimerization effect ) or quarter - filled ( for weak dimerization ) . due to the commensurate filling",
    ", a strictly one - dimensional model is expected to lead to a mott insulating behavior .",
    "indeed , the ( tmttf)@xmath0 salts , with @xmath1  =  pf@xmath2 or br , are insulators at low temperatures @xcite with a substantial single particle gap ( @xmath67  @xmath4 for the pf@xmath2 salt ) . for these compounds",
    "the gap is so high that the interchain hopping is suppressed by the insulating nature of the 1d phase and is not relevant .    for the tmtsf family",
    ", however , one expects a stronger competition between the mott gap and the interchain hopping . in a very crude way",
    ", the interchain hopping could be viewed as an effective doping leading to deviations from the commensurate filling ( which is insulating ) .",
    "the optical features we observe are close to those which have been calculated for a _ doped _ one dimensional mott insulator : @xcite a mott gap and a zero - energy mode for small doping levels .",
    "of course for the low energy mode , this is an oversimplified view , since the interchain hopping makes the system two dimensional , and the low energy feature is unlikely to be described by a simple one dimensional theory .",
    "we now discuss in detail the two distinct features observed in the optical conductivity . while it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : pf6-as][fig : clo4-as ] that these two features develop progressively as the temperature is lowered , we will focus our attention on the lowest temperatures ( 1020k ) , just above the phase transitions to broken - symmetry ground states .      as discussed above , the naive upper limit for the crossover from 1d to 2d or 3d nature is @xmath68@xmath4 , and therefore the peak structure in the conductivity should be well described by a purely one - dimensional theory .",
    "in such a 1d regime the effects of electron  electron interactions are particularly important and lead to the formation of a non - fermi liquid state , the so - called tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) .",
    "@xcite such a state is characterized by an absence of single electron - like quasiparticles and by a non - universal decay of the various correlation functions .",
    "all of the excitations of the system , even the single particle excitations , can be described in terms of charge density fluctuations , whose energy is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 , the charge density , and @xmath71 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath38 .",
    "all of the interaction effects are hidden in the parameters @xmath72 ( the velocity of charge excitations ) and @xmath73 ( the luttinger liquid exponent controlling the decay of all correlation functions ) . initially derived for interactions much weaker than the bandwidth , @xcite",
    "this description has been proven to be valid for an arbitrary one - dimensional interacting system , @xcite provided one uses the proper @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the tll description can be viewed as an effective low energy description of the one - dimensional electron gas , which is reminiscent of fl theory as a low energy description of the three - dimensional interacting electron gas ( with quite different physics ) .",
    "the above luttinger liquid parameters can be viewed as the 1d equivalents of the landau parameters of a fl . in a general way",
    ", @xmath74 is the noninteracting point , with @xmath75 corresponding to attraction and @xmath76 to repulsion .",
    "depending on the interaction strength , the tll may be unstable for commensurate fillings , causing the system to become a mott insulator , with a charge gap .",
    "@xcite the mechanism leading to this insulating state is now well understood and can be easily described within the tll formalism .",
    "when the filling is commensurate , interactions give rise to additional contributions to the tll hamiltonian .",
    "these are the so - called umklapp processes of the form @xmath77 where @xmath52 is the order of the commensurability ( @xmath78 for half filling  one particle per site @xcite ; @xmath79 for quarter filling ",
    "one particle every two sites , and so on @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath80 is the umklapp process corresponding to the commensurability @xmath52 .",
    "the commensurability of order @xmath52 is relevant provided @xmath81 ( the higher the commensurability the more repulsive the interaction has to be ) .",
    "when the umklapp term is relevant it opens a gap in the charge spectrum of the form @xmath82 for @xmath80 much less than the bandwidth @xmath83 .",
    "this is the relevant situation to describe the organic compounds because the band is quarter - filled .",
    "a quarter - filling umklapp thus exists with a coefficient of order @xmath84 , for a typical interaction of order @xmath85 and a bandwidth of order @xmath83 .",
    "however , because the chains are slightly dimerized , a half - filled umklapp is also generated with a value on the order of @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the dimerization gap.@xcite which umklapp term dominates depends , of course , on the strength of the interactions , on @xmath73 ( also controlled by the interactions ) , and on the magnitude of the dimerization gap .",
    "this 1d insulator picture thus provides a good description of the gross features observed in the conductivity .",
    "the peak corresponds to the mott gap and would also be consistent with finding most ( or _ all _ , if the system was a purely one - dimensional mott insulator ) of the spectral weight in the finite frequency peak .    because a complete description of the dynamic conductivity in such a one - dimensional mott insulator exists , @xcite one can make _ quantitative _  comparisons of the data to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the salient feature is a nonuniversal power law behavior controlled by the interactions for @xmath88 : @xmath89 besides providing a good test of the one - dimensional theory , a fit of the data to the form of eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) gives direct access to the luttinger liquid exponent @xmath73 .",
    "we will come back to the determination of @xmath73 and the physical consequences in section  [ sec : disclut ] , and confine the current discussion to a direct analysis of the data .",
    "indeed when rescaled by the mott gap , the three systems ( @xmath1=clo@xmath3 , pf@xmath2 , and asf@xmath2 ) exhibit remarkably similar behavior , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaled ] .",
    "a log  log plot of the data for the three different systems is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] .",
    "the agreement with the prediction of the one - dimensional theory is quite good over more than one decade in frequency , leading to an exponent @xmath90 .",
    "the observed power law in the frequency dependence is also in very reasonable agreement with the observed temperature dependence of the resistivity , which is found to be roughly linear above 100k once thermal expansion has been taken into account .",
    "@xcite indeed in a purely 1d model , the temperature dependence of the resistivity is given by @xcite @xmath91 and thus the frequency and temperature dependence should be related by @xmath92 with no undetermined adjustable parameter .",
    "although a precise determination of the temperature exponent is difficult because of thermal expansion and the possibility of other sources of scattering , eq .  ( [ eq : consist ] ) is again consistent with the data .",
    "it thus seems very natural to interpret the high frequency part of the optical conductivity in terms of a mott insulator",
    ". the observed mott gap would be rather large ( @xmath93 because the optical gap is twice the thermodynamic one ) .",
    "due to the apparent contradiction of having a rather large mott gap and a good metallic dc conductivity , it was proposed that the peak structure was due to the dimerization gap @xmath87 itself .",
    "@xcite . this would indeed be the case for an extremely strong ( nearly infinite ) repulsion , with the quarter - filled band being transformed into a half - filled band of ( nearly non - interacting ) spinless fermions .",
    "it was then argued that the real charge gap of the problem was smaller , on the order of @xmath94k .",
    "however , such an interpretation fails to reproduce the observed frequency dependence above the peak in conductivity . using the same type of analysis for the conductivity as in ref .  , and attributing the peak to the dimerization gap , results in @xmath95 for @xmath96 , as in a simple semiconductor ( corresponding to nearly free spinless fermions ) . the observed power - law ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] ) differs significantly from this prediction , making such an interpretation of the data very unlikely .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : over ] , there is in fact no contradiction between a good metallic dc conductivity and a large mott gap , provided that the system is doped slightly away from commensurate filling .",
    "@xcite indeed , in a very crude way this is what seems to be observed here , with the `` drude '' peak containing only one hundredth of the carriers .",
    "although no real doping exists from a chemistry point of view , one could attribute such a deviation from commensurability to the effects of interchain hopping .",
    "if single particle hopping between chains is relevant , small deviations from commensurate filling due to the warping of the fermi surface exist , and should lead to effects equivalent to real doping on a single chain .",
    "of course , such a picture is only a poor man s way of viewing the low frequency structure .",
    "since the interchain hopping is relevant , the low frequency peak should in principle be described by a full two - dimensional theory ( of interacting fermions ) . due to the complexity of such a problem , it is thus interesting to compare , from a purely phenomenological point of view , the shape of the observed drude peak with fl predictions as well as with the predictions of the naive one - dimensional theory of a doped mott insulator .",
    "such a comparison is performed in the next section .      the model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] predicts the appearance of a delta function dc conductivity in a 1d hubbard system which is doped away from half - filling .",
    "as we have demonstrated , the finite frequency mode which develops in these materials is in agreement with such a model , and we do indeed see a corresponding peak in the conductivity at zero frequency .",
    "this extremely narrow resonance leads to the high dc conductivities seen in these materials , yet it accounts for only 1% of the total spectral weight , as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : pf6-as]b .",
    "a similar peak , with an even smaller fraction of the spectral weight , has recently been reported in ( tmtsf)@xmath18clo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite qualitatively , this mode looks like a narrow drude response , of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sim - drude ] ) , but our data on the ( tmtsf)@xmath18pf@xmath2 compound indicate that this is not the case .",
    "the two dashed lines in figs .",

    "it is clear that neither gives a satisfactory fit to either the conductivity or absorptivity .",
    "although this analysis depends strongly on the microwave cavity perturbation data between 0.1 and 5  @xmath4 , this technique is well developed and produces reliable data even for such highly conducting materials .",
    "@xcite in addition , at 9  ghz a number of other measurements @xcite of the surface resistance have been made and all agree with our results within the experimental uncertainty shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : abs - low ] .",
    "_ @xcite have also measured this compound in a 16.5  ghz cavity . from their data",
    "we have calculated an absorptivity of approximately @xmath102 , which is significantly higher than we have found , in even greater disagreement with the two simple drude fits .",
    "finally , at 60  ghz we were able to measure both @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the maxima of both the electric and magnetic fields @xcite and have found that within experimental error they are equal to each other and to the dc resistivity at 20k .",
    "@xcite we are certain that the discrepancies between the measured data and the simple drude fits , especially at the higher frequencies , are outside of the experimental uncertainty .",
    "similarly , it is clear that neither the low energy mode nor the conductivity below the mott gap can be described _",
    "quantitatively _  by a simple one - dimensional theory , even taking into account a phenomenological doping .",
    "indeed , in a purely 1d theory the conductivity @xmath103 should grow as @xmath104 between the drude peak and the mott peak , @xcite but such a power is not observed experimentally . in addition , in a doped one - dimensional system the width of the @xmath105 peak remains extremely narrow since all electron  electron scattering that can lead to dissipation has been shifted to higher energy .    in order to obtain a satisfactory description of these low frequency data",
    ", it thus seems necessary to turn to a fermi liquid ( fl ) picture .",

    "the differences at lower frequencies are a result of the perfectly straight interpolation between the microwave absorptivity points , shown by the solid line .",
    "it is clear that within the error bars , the fl fit is an equally good interpolation .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the results are shown on a logarithmic frequency scale , which tends to enhance the low frequency range .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sig - low ] displays the kramers - kronig calculation and the fits on a linear frequency scale , showing the obvious improvement obtained with the generalized drude fit .",
    "this analysis , however , leads to an anomalously small value for @xmath127 , as frequency dependent scattering is not expected at frequencies significantly less than the temperature ( @xmath128@xmath4 at 20k ) .",
    "in addition , ruvalds and virosztek have shown that nesting of the fermi surface modifies the electron ",
    "electron scattering and leads to a scattering rate which is instead linear in both frequency and temperature .",
    "@xcite because of the nesting of the fermi surface in the ( tmtsf)@xmath0 compounds , @xcite we might expect such a form to apply in this case , however our attempts to fit the ( tmtsf)@xmath18pf@xmath2 data with their form have proven to be unsatisfactory , giving only a small improvement over the simple drude fits .",
    "further experiments at low frequencies could clarify these issues .",
    "the behavior of the optical conductivity described above raises several interesting questions .",
    "previous attempts to interpret some features of the tmtsf and tmttf materials in terms of one - dimensional systems close to a mott transition were confined to a qualitative description of the differences between these two families .",
    "@xcite it was generally argued that only the half - filling umklapp is important , and that the differences between the tmttf and the tmtsf families are due to the much smaller dimerization in the latter case , leading to a smaller @xmath129 , and to the observed metallic dc behavior .",
    "the quarter - filling umklapp was not considered because it was beyond the reach of the perturbative techniques used at that time .",
    "now , non - perturbative calculations of the frequency dependence of the conductivity @xcite enable us to investigate the consequences of attributing the mott gap to either of these two umklapps .",
    "if one interprets the high frequency behavior in terms of a one - dimensional mott insulator , two possibilities arise depending on whether the half- or quarter - filled umklapp is dominant . in the former case",
    ", one would have @xmath130 leading to a rather weak repulsive system with @xmath131 .",
    "the standard perturbative formula , @xmath132 , leads to relatively small interactions of strength @xmath133 .",
    "such a small value of the interaction would pose several problems .",
    "it is in disagreement with simple estimates based on quantum - chemistry calculations @xcite or estimations of the interactions in the spin sectors @xcite(there is no a priori reason to assume that interactions would cancel in the charge sector ) .",
    "in addition , since the gap opened by the half - filled umklapp would be given by @xmath134 the rather small half - filled umklapp constant @xmath135 , where @xmath87 is the dimerization gap , and the rather large exponent @xmath136 would lead to an exceedingly small value for the mott gap , incompatible with the observed peak in the optical conductivity of figs .",
    "[ fig : pf6-as][fig : clo4-as ] .",
    "thus the mott gap seen in the optical conductivity is unlikely to be due to the half - filling umklapp .",
    "as suggested in the context of the temperature dependence of the conductivity , @xcite a way out of this problem is to assume that the conductivity is dominated by the quarter - filled umklapp . in that case",
    "the exponent of the frequency dependence is @xmath137 , leading to a much smaller value of @xmath138 .",
    "such a small value of @xmath73 corresponds to a relatively large repulsion .",
    "the existence of such large repulsion is consistent with the initial hypothesis of predominance of the quarter - filling umklapp . in that case",
    "@xmath139 can be of order one since @xmath140 , whereas @xmath129 , being due to dimerization , would still be much smaller than the typical interaction @xmath85 ( by a factor @xmath141 ) .",
    "such a small value of @xmath73 also gives a density of states exponent @xmath142 , in reasonable agreement with photoemission observations .",
    "@xcite however the photoemission results should be taken with some degree of care , due to the large range of energy over which the tll behavior was observed .",
    "the mott gap due to the quarter - filled umklapp would be given by an analogous formula to eq .",
    "( [ legap ] ) with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the numerical value of the exponent would remain unchanged , but because the interactions are now allowed to be larger , @xmath145 can be closer to @xmath83 , allowing for reasonably large values of the mott gap .",
    "it is of course not obvious that one can get such a small value of @xmath73 for the tmtsf family from reasonable microscopic interactions .",
    "this is probably not a serious problem , however , since the range of the interaction is more important than the strength in getting a small @xmath73 ( a purely local repulsion can not get below @xmath146 ) .",
    "although a direct calculation of @xmath73 from a microscopic model is too strongly dependent on the precise details of the model to be really quantitative , the order of magnitude of an interaction needed to get @xmath147 is not incompatible with what is expected microscopically , @xcite or estimated from the uniform susceptibility .",
    "@xcite    the interpretation of the optical conductivity in terms of quarter - filling umklapp ,",
    "although quite different from the standard view , @xcite thus seems more reasonable .",
    "however it has also its share of problems and raises interesting issues .",
    "first , if the quarter - filling umklapp plays an important role in the tmtsf family it is likely to also play a role in the parent tmttf family .",
    "the dimerization gap differs by a mere factor of two between the two families , and it would be surprising if this simple enhancement of the @xmath129 constant would make it dominate over @xmath145 ( which is not expected to change much ) .",
    "the question is of importance because , until now , the different behavior of the dc conductivity between the two families has been attributed to the change in the dimerization .",
    "@xcite the reduction of dimerization with pressure was supposed to reduce @xmath129 and hence the mott gap . if the dominant umklapp process is the quarter - filling one this explanation can not continue to hold because @xmath145 is expected to be only weakly pressure dependent",
    ". however , experimentally one still observes a large difference in the mott gap between the two families .",
    "one possible explanation for the large change of gap under pressure ( or by changing the family ) could be the change in the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ legap ] ) , i.e.  a change of @xmath73 and not so much a change of the umklapp coupling constant , as is usually advocated .",
    "indeed , since @xmath73 is close to the value where the umklapp term is irrelevant , even a small change in @xmath73 can produce a relatively large variation in the gap ( the gap would go to zero for @xmath148 ) .",
    "the main problem of such a small value of @xmath73 would be its effect on the interchain hopping . using the standard formula for the renormalization of the transverse hopping due to interactions @xcite would give an effective hopping between the chains @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the density of states exponent .",
    "a value of @xmath151 gives @xmath152 , leading to a small crossover value , on the order of 30k , between the one - dimensional regime and a regime where the hopping between the chains is relevant .",
    "such a low crossover scale was indeed the one advocated based on both nmr @xcite and magnetoresistance experiments .",
    "@xcite however , such a small value of the effective interchain hopping is incompatible with several observations .",
    "first the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity shows a crossover between a roughly linear @xmath153 behavior , that can be interpreted in terms of a one - dimensional regime , to a @xmath154 regime at a scale of 150200  k. @xcite it is very natural to interpret such a change of behavior in terms of a crossover to a more two - dimensional regime , where the interchain hopping is relevant , leading to @xmath155  k. such a value is in good agreement with measurements of the transverse conductivity that provide a very sensitive way of probing this dimensional crossover , @xcite and with direct low temperature measurements of @xmath156 .",
    "@xcite second , although it is quite difficult to extract the crossover scale from the optical or dc conductivity along the chains alone , the behavior of the optical conductivity below the mott peak does not follow the prediction ( @xmath104 ) of a purely one - dimensional model very well .",
    "@xcite this again suggests a crossover towards two - dimensional behavior at an energy scale on the order of @xmath157  k. third , on a more theoretical level , if the mott gap was much higher than the effective interchain hopping , the system would remain one - dimensional @xcite and thus insulating .",
    "@xcite a small value of @xmath156 is thus again incompatible with the observed metallic behavior at low frequency .",
    "paradoxically , the observed crossover scale @xmath158  k would be compatible with eq .",
    "( [ effecthop ] ) , if the value of @xmath73 corresponding to the half - filling umklapp was used , namely very weak interactions , but as we saw above such a value of @xmath73 seems incompatible with other observations .    below an energy scale on the order of 200  k",
    ", the system would therefore be in a two - dimensional regime .",
    "the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : zero - energy ] , suggests the possibility that at low frequencies and temperatures the behavior in this regime is that of a simple fl .",
    "such behavior is reasonable , and in agreement with the results of nmr measurements at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite however , the precise nature of the phase below the 1d to 2d crossover temperature still remains to be clarified , in particular at intermediate temperatures and frequencies .",
    "proposals have been made about the existence of a two - dimensional luttinger liquid with power law correlation functions .",
    "@xcite whether the experimentally observed phase is of such nature remains to be checked .",
    "some quantities , however , show a simple exponent ( e.g.  @xmath159 ) , which is quite incompatible with the suspected power - law dependence of the hypothetical two - dimensional luttinger liquid .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of our measurements of the on - chain , metallic state electrodynamics of three bechgaard salts , ( tmtsf)@xmath0 . in all three cases ,",
    "we find dramatic deviations from the simple drude response , with the frequency dependent conductivity instead consisting of two distinct features : a narrow mode at low energy containing a very small part of the spectral weight ( @xmath160 ) and a high energy mode centered around 200  @xmath4 .",
    "we have argued that these are the characteristics of a highly anisotropic interacting electron system , with either a half- or quarter - filled band .",
    "this leads to a mott gap and , at frequencies above the effective interchain transfer integral , to a luttinger liquid state  consequently we call this a mott - tomonaga - luttinger liquid",
    ".    the finite energy feature can be successfully described as the absorption above the mott gap in such a one - dimensional luttinger liquid . in particular , above the gap the optical conductivity behaves as a power law of the frequency @xmath161 , in a way characteristic of a tll .",
    "the exponent @xmath162 is determined experimentally to be @xmath163 .",
    "the low energy feature in the conductivity can be successfully described by using a frequency dependent relaxation rate and effective mass with quadratic frequency dependence , suggestive of a fermi liquid .",
    "however , further studies are needed at these low energies in order to rule out other mechanisms .",
    "comparison of the data with the tll theory , along with the value of the exponent @xmath162 , suggest that the dominant mechanism responsible for the opening of the mott gap is the quarter - filling of the band .",
    "this conclusion leads to a luttinger liquid parameter @xmath164 , corresponding to very strong repulsion .",
    "the fact that the 1d theory is unable to account quantitatively for the data below the high energy peak seems to suggest that the crossover to a two - dimensional regime occurs at relatively high energies .",
    "although the conductivity at low frequencies is in agreement with that arising from electron ",
    "electron scattering , and at high frequencies with predictions based on the tll model , a host of unresolved questions remain .",
    "these include the precise nature of this crossover , and the magnitude of the effective transfer integral @xmath165 where it occurs .",
    "it also remains to be seen whether our experiments are compatible with studies which directly probe the fermi surface of these compounds .",
    "experiments along directions perpendicular to the chains , together with optical studies on the more anisotropic tmttf compounds , should help to clarify these unresolved questions , and are currently underway .",
