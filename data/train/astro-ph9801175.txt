    "the field towards the @xmath0 quasar pair pc1643 + 4631  a&b contains a cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) decrement , believed to be the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect of a massive cluster or proto - cluster of galaxies ( jones et al .",
    "1997 ; saunders , these proceedings ) .",
    "initial optical and infrared follow - up programme revealed no evidence for cluster galaxies to at least @xmath4 ( saunders et al .",
    "1997 ) , and , using an x - ray upper limit obtained with a deep rosat observation , kneissl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that an isothermal cluster similar those seen at low - redshift clusters would have to lie at @xmath5 .",
    "a second candidate high - redshift sz cluster , towards a quasar pair at @xmath6 , also appears blank in deep optical and x - ray observations ( richards et al .",
    "we were thus prompted to initiate a search for cluster galaxies at @xmath7 , and as a first step we have carried out a very deep multicolour optical imaging programme of the pc1643 + 4631 field .",
    "in 1996 april we observed the central 5 @xmath8 5 region of the pc1643 + 4631  a&b field with the prime focus camera at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope .",
    "images were obtained in @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 and @xmath12 ; with a custom - made @xmath13 filter kindly lent to us by r.  mcmahon ; and with two custom - made narrow - band filters , one centered on ly-@xmath14 at the reshift of the quasars and one centered on the wavelength of the damped ly-@xmath14 absorption system at @xmath15 towards quasar pc  1643 + 463  a. we reached one - sigma surface brightness limits ( in ab mag arcsec@xmath16 ) of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and between 27.4 and 28.6 in the other bands .",
    "full details of the observations and data analysis will be published shortly ( haynes et al . in preparation ) and an investigation of the properties of candidate galaxies in the redshift range @xmath19 is underway ( cotter et al . in preparation ) . in this contribution",
    "we focus on the candidate members of what is rapidly becoming a well - studied population : the lyman - break galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "we have followed the principle adopted in the surveys of steidel et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) to identify galaxies at @xmath2 via the characteristic colours caused by the lyman - limit break straddling the @xmath9 and @xmath13 bands .",
    "although we use standard johnson @xmath9 and @xmath11 filters rather than the custom filters of steidel et al . , we find that the locus of @xmath2 galaxies is still well defined . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the colour criteria @xmath20 , @xmath21 isolate model galaxies at @xmath2 and avoid contamination from stars  this region of the colour - colour plane is equivalent to the `` robust '' criteria of steidel et al .    in this region of colour - colour space we find 27 objects ( excluding the two quasars ) to @xmath22 , which gives a surface density of @xmath23 arcmin@xmath16 .",
    "this surface density is comparable to the 0.73 arcmin@xmath16 surface density of `` robust '' candidates in the field of the @xmath3 structure discovered by steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; indeed , tantalizingly , it is greater at the two - sigma level .",
    "naturally we urge caution in interpreting this result as representing a real structure at @xmath24 .",
    "firstly , until the clustering properties of lyman - break galaxies are known in detail , it will not be possible to evaluate the probability that an above - average surface density in a small field of view corresponds to a real large structure ( we note that our images are several times smaller than those of steidel et al .",
    "of course , prior knowledge of an sz - producing structure along the line of sight would increase this probability .",
    "secondly , an excess of candidate objects at @xmath2 does not necessarily imply a structure at this redshift .",
    "lyman - break galaxies have very small characteristic sizes ( see , e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) , and so are essentially unresolved with the typical 0.8  seeing disk of our images .",
    "thus , for a fixed surface brightness limit , one would expect to find an excess of these galaxies if the field contains an unseen lens at a lower redshift , as in the model proposed by saunders et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the only way to determine if these candidates objects represent a real structure at @xmath25 is to proceed with spectroscopy on 10-m class telescopes . to this end",
    ", we are currently planning keck lris observations in collaboration with the berkeley group .",
    "whatever the cause of the excess of @xmath2 lyman - break candidates , it will provide a strong indication of the nature of the system causing the cmb decrement in the field .",
    "the investigation of the pc1643 + 4631 cmb decrement to date has been carried out by the authors of jones at al .",
