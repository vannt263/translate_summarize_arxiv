    "the artificial prepared superlattices have been an important system for investigating the relevancy of periodic structure to the physical properties of the bulk system .",
    "the idea is that if the dephasing length of the electron extends over many periods , the superlattice structure becomes relevant .",
    "therefore , by engineering the periodic structure appropriately , one is able to tune the effective parameters that electrons experience , thus it may enable us to access more regions in the parameter space .",
    "in particular , one may be able to engineer the density of state so that the transport properties can be changed .",
    "such systems have motivated a lot of studies both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "there are many outstanding issues arising from the investigation of superlattice systems .",
    "for instance , the giant magnetoresistance ( mr ) observed in magnetic superlattices , such as fe / cr , has triggered serious investigation of the transport through heterostructure of metal and ferromagnetic materials@xcite .",
    "the superlattice that has superconductors involved is another important system .",
    "it was shown in an early study that certain superlattice structure can close the energy gap of s - wave superconductors@xcite , which is interesting by itself and may have real applications in the future .",
    "the interest in supperlatices with superconductors has been further boosted up since the discovery of the high temperature superconductors ( htsc)@xcite .",
    "the layered structure along the c - axis and particularly the existence of closely packed @xmath0 planes makes htsc a natural - occurring superconducting superlattice system .",
    "a great body of work has thus been devoted to investigate the c - axis dynamic properties during the past@xcite .",
    "after the intense work for so many years , it now becomes clear that in the overdoped region , the normal state of high tc superconductors is metallic like for both c - axis and in - plane directions@xcite . in particular",
    ", the splitting due to hopping between adjacent @xmath0 planes in a unit cell are seen directly in recent photoemission experiments @xcite . while these works imply that single particle hopping definitely occurs along the c direction , it is not clear how exactly one should model the transport properties of the high tc cuprates along the c - axis in the superconducting phase and how the superlattice structure affects the single particle transportation along the c direction .",
    "the splitting observed in the photoemission experiments implies that neighboring @xmath0 planes in a unit cell are strongly coupled by a large hopping integral .",
    "therefore , one can model it by a single superconducting layer , which is coupled to the superconducting layers in adjacent unit cells via an effective hopping integral @xmath1 .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the coherence length along the c direction is about the width of each superconducting layer .",
    "the problem is then how one should model layers between adjacent superconducting layers .",
    "it was pointed in ref.@xcite that there exist two distinct limits , depending on the ratio  @xmath2 to @xmath3 . in the limit",
    "when @xmath1  is much smaller than @xmath4 , the system behaves more like a nsnsn ... nsn ( or a isisisisi ) superlattice , i.e. , a normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) or insulator - superconductor ( is ) superlattice . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath1  is close to @xmath3 in magnitude , different unit cells are coupled strongly and the system behaves as a usual anisotropic superconductor . in this work ,",
    "we shall be mainly investigating the nonlinear transport in the limit when @xmath1  is much smaller than @xmath3 . in order to model the c - axis transport in htsc",
    ", we shall consider several concrete models , for instance , the ns and is superlattice models as both of them can give rise metallic behaviors in c and ab directions in the normal state .",
    "another possible modification is to consider a ns superlattice with a large mass anisotropy ( effective mass in the c - axis  effective mass in ab directions ) in the metal so that electrons essentially hop along the c - axis in the ns superlattice model .",
    "two quantities will be calculated : ( 1 ) the density of state for single particles , which will be useful for the transport measurement with high resistance contact .",
    "( 2 ) the differential conductance ( @xmath5 ) for measurements with low resistance contact , such as measurement made by planar junctions .",
    "we shall include the d - wave nature and consider general fermi surface topology .",
    "our results will be useful for artificial superlattices such as the @xmath6 superlattice system @xcite . at phenomenological level",
    ", they also provide insights to the issue that to what extent the c - axis of htcs can be thought as a ns superlattice or a is superlattice , in particular , how the superlattice structure along the c - axis affects the tunneling spectrum .",
    "our results indicate that in the case for a ns superlattice , if the mass anisotropy is small , the superlattice structure will induce subgap structure in the density of state . for large mass anisotropy in the metal",
    ", however , the bulk d - wave - like density of state is reproduced with the quasi - particle peak shifted to a smaller value , in contrast to the case when we model the c - axis as a is superlattice where the quasi - particle peak remains at the gap value .",
    "the ns superlattice model provides a possible explanation of why some measurements of the gap size along the c direction give smaller values@xcite .",
    "we also calculate the @xmath5 curve for measurements using planar junction or point contact with large contact area along the c - direction .",
    "two important features are found to be due to the superlattice structure : ( 1 ) the width of the andreev peak at zero bias is considerably smaller than the gap due to destructive interference of andreev reflections from all the superconductors .",
    "this gives a natural explanation to why in some old measurement , the andreev peak along the c - axis appeared to be so sharp and was thought as zero - bias resonant conductance peak@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) there exist distinct oscillations in the region when @xmath7 is larger than the gap size .",
    "this is also a result of interference from all in the interfaces . in particular , the is superlattice",
    "will provide a rising background so that these oscillations gradually rises as @xmath7 increases .",
    "both features are observed in a recent measurement of au / bi2212 junctions near @xmath3@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , the density of state is calculated in the framework of bogolubov de - genne equation .",
    "we show that in the large mass anisotropy limit of the ns superlattice , the usual d - wave like behavior is reproduced .",
    "we also calculate the case when it is a si superlattice and briefly compare these results . in sec.iii ,",
    "the non - linear @xmath8 curve for planar junctions is calculated and its relation to experiments is discussed . finally , we give a concluding remark in sec.iv .",
    "we shall start by investigating the density of state for a ns superlattice . a ns superlattice with a spherical fermi surface and s - wave for superconductors",
    "was previously considered by hahn@xcite to model transport along the c - axis for ybco . to account for the c - axis transport of high tc cuprates",
    ", we shall extend it to include d - wave nature and use a more general fermi surface . in particular , during our calculation , we shall also briefly address the effect due to a particular form for the c - axis hopping @xmath9 .",
    "this particular form of hopping is suggested from the measurement of angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and band theoretical calculation@xcite . here",
    "@xmath10 is the angle @xmath11 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we shall first calculate the density of state . in the most general case ,",
    "the density of state is given by @xmath12 when @xmath13 is the block wavenumber along the c - axis .",
    "for given @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , if @xmath17 can be found , @xmath18 can be rewritten as @xmath19 where we have defined the one dimensional density of state by @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", one needs to find @xmath17 . for a ns superlattice ,",
    "a suitable framework for calculating @xmath21 is the bogolubov de - genne equation which can be written as    @xmath22 \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } u({\\bf r } ) \\\\",
    "\\upsilon ( { \\bf r } ) \\end{array } \\right ] \\ = e\\left [   \\begin{array}{c } u({\\bf r } ) \\\\   \\upsilon ( { \\bf r } ) \\end{array } \\right ] ,   \\label{bdg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 in the superconducting part while in the metal part , we simply set @xmath25 .",
    "we shall assume a general form for @xmath26 @xmath27 since the system is translationally invariant in x and y directions , @xmath28 and @xmath16 are conserved so that we can write @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "eqs.([bdg ] ) then reduces to one dimensional equations .",
    "in the metal part , @xmath31 , @xmath28 and @xmath16 are on the fermi surface so that we may parameterize @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the azimuthal angle along the c direction . in this parameterization , for a given energy @xmath14 , the particle ( @xmath36 ) and hole ( @xmath37 ) momentum become @xmath38}$ ] in the superconducting part , while @xmath39 in the metal . furthermore , eq.([dos1 ] ) becomes @xmath40 it is important to note that the factor @xmath41 has to be positive as it represents  @xmath42 at the fermi surface in the absence of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , _  large _ @xmath44 _",
    ", i.e. , large mass anisotropy in the metal , restricts electrons to hop only along the c - axis . _",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath45 and @xmath46 have to to continuous at boundaries .",
    "since the system is periodic , it is sufficient to impose the boundary conditions within a unit cell ( see fig .",
    "1 )    @xmath47    where the last two equations follow from the bloch theorem with @xmath48 . following ref.@xcite and using the above boundary conditions",
    ", one finds that @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 where @xmath51 are all real .",
    "since@xmath52 , the four roots to eq.([lamda ] ) are in the form @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "3(b ) shows a case when @xmath101 becomes nonzero .",
    "it is obvious that the introduction of any small n section ( i.e. , small @xmath101 ) moves the quasi - particle peak into the subgap region while  leaving in a peak - like structure at @xmath115 .",

    "_ large mass anisotropy limit _",
    "we now discuss the effect of increasing the ratio@xmath118 . a possible candidate to describe the high tc cuprates",
    "is the limit when @xmath44 becomes so large that electrons essentially can only hop along the c - axis between cuo@xmath119 planes in different unit cells . as we pointed it out",
    "already that large @xmath44 restricts @xmath35 to be small . for infinite @xmath44 , we can simply set @xmath120 and perform the following reduced integral @xmath121 if the superconducting part is s - wave , @xmath122 is @xmath123 . consider the case when  @xmath124 , it is easy to see that @xmath125 .",
    "we find that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the point is that the one dimensional density of state @xmath128 starts from a gap whose size is determined by the root to @xmath129 for @xmath130 . near @xmath131 , one has @xmath132 which has a bcs - like square root singularity but at smaller energy ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "therefore , in the lower energy section , we obtain a bulk s - wave like density of state with quasi - particle peak at smaller energy . for high energy sections , near the zone boundary of @xmath13 , the bcs - like square root singularity will repeat again . for d - wave superconductors , eq.([inf ] ) is replaced by @xmath134 where @xmath135 depends on @xmath10 .",

    ", we show the result of direct integration over @xmath10 for different @xmath136 ratios .",
    "it is clear that at low energy section , @xmath122 behaves similar to the bulk d - wave density of state , except that the quasi - particle peak moves to smaller energy .",
    "if we take @xmath137 @xmath138 , the quasi - particle peak is around @xmath139 mev which is close to what experiments have seen@xcite .",
    "note that another difference between the above results and the true bulk d - wave density of state may lie at high energy section .",
    "in general , the superlattice structure introduces coupling among the wavevector of the electron and the reciprocal lattice vectors of the superlattice , i.e. , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the coupling strength depends on the magnitude of the fourier component @xmath142 .",
    "if  the superlattice periodicity is good , @xmath143 will not be small .",
    "the superlattice structure will force @xmath122 to have similar d - wave like structure whenever the zone boundary ( @xmath144 ) is encountered in high energy sectors . however , if the system is not large enough along the c direction or the dephasing length of the electron is short , one may expect that @xmath143 is small and hence the repeated structure in high energy section will not appear .",
    "we now address the effect due to the anisotropy of the c - axis hopping .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath145 .",
    "as it is clear from the above calculations and also the following calculation for the is superlattice , the density of state depends only on the ratio of @xmath146 to @xmath147 ( defined as @xmath148 ) . obviously , if both the intra - superconducting cells and inter - superconducting cells c - axis hoppings follow the same form .",
    "there will be no effect at all .",
    "however , new features may arise if  they do not follow the same form .",
    "in particular , we find that if either @xmath146 or @xmath149 does not depend on @xmath10 , a second peak could arise inside the subgap region . in views of past experimental findings , this seems to be unlikely .",

    "in fig.5 , we show a  typical result for the three dimensional density of state for the si superlattice .",
    "because for energy below the gap , @xmath76 , quasi particles and quasi holes are both evanescent , the quasi - particle peaks now move to the gap value ( except that there is a slight asymmetry in particles and holes ) .",
    "technically , this is due to that for @xmath112 , all factors in @xmath159 are not oscillatory and thus the right hand side in eq.([cos ] ) is greater than one , without any propagating solutions .",
    "this is similar to the case for a bulk d - wave superconductor as we analyzed for fig.3(a ) , so one gets quasi - particle peaks right at the gap value .",
    "the dramatic difference in the positions of the quasi - particle peaks for the ns and is superlattices offers a useful check on both models . for artificial made ns superlattices ,",
    "the reduction in the position of  the quasi - particle peak has been observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , for the c - axis measurements on real high tc materials , the results are controversial and remains to be clarified in the future@xcite .",

    "the schematic setup is shown in fig.6 . in principle , at first and last interfaces that connect with the electrodes , there may exist insulating layers .",
    "this will be included as interfacial scattering potentials .",
    "the most important feature coming out from this type of measurement , in comparison to the high contact resistance measurement , is the possible exhibition of the excess current due to the andreev reflection ( ar ) .",

    "we shall approximate the voltages in each layer ( either in n or s ) by constants such that the slope of the voltage , thus the electric field , is fixed .",

    "firstly , because electron can only flow into the system from the high voltage electrode , we require    @xmath209    secondly , in the low voltage electrode , we impose the condition    @xmath210    so that no particle ( both hole and electron ) flows into the system from the lowest voltage side .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and([eq2 ] ) are then sufficient to determine the amplitude @xmath211 and @xmath212 in terms components of @xmath213 , we find that    @xmath214    to obtain the differential conductance in terms of the above coefficients , we apply the same argument used in ref.@xcite in which one treats the superlattice between electrodes as a scattering center .",
    "we obtain the same expression for the differential conductance    @xmath215    where @xmath216 is the area for the junction .    to illustrate the behavior of the differential conductance , it is useful to consider the simplest case when @xmath217 , i.e. , a nsn structure",
    ". this will be the more realistic configuration for measurement on what is often referred as the ns junction in the literature@xcite .",
    "we shall consider the case when @xmath150 and @xmath218 so that one can apply the so - called andreev approximation in which one approximates @xmath194 and @xmath219 by @xmath220 ( @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) , i.e. , the wavevectors along c - axis are approximated by @xmath177 .",
    "this is the approximation used to derive the differential conductance of the ns junction in the btk theory@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that for a nsn junction , such approximation leads to a result with zero andreev current .",
    "a closer examination shows that in the large @xmath166 , one has to keep the expansion of both @xmath223 and @xmath219 to the first order in @xmath224 or @xmath225 when computing the phase terms .",
    "we find that such manipulation leads to @xmath226 therefore , for @xmath76 , @xmath81 is purely imaginary and hence in the limit of large @xmath102 , @xmath212 approaches @xmath227 , recovering the standard btk result . for @xmath228 ,",
    "@xmath81 is positive and @xmath212 oscillates with periods , determined only by @xmath102 .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath212 was actually observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is a result of interference of andreev reflection from both interfaces ( left and right interfaces ) of the superconductors . in fig.7(a ) , we show the @xmath5 curves of directional tunneling ( @xmath229 and without using the andreev approximation ) for different @xmath102 with @xmath101 being fixed at one .",
    "one sees that the period of oscillation decreases for increasing @xmath102 , in consistent with the above analysis .",
    "as @xmath174 exceeds one ,  the lengthscale @xmath101 also participates in determining the oscillations . in this case , the andreev approximation always yields @xmath230 when @xmath231 because @xmath232 and @xmath233 are always zero in this approximation .",
    "the total conductance is thus determined by @xmath212 given by @xmath234 .",
    "7(b ) shows the calculated differential conductance for the directional tunneling ( electrons incident perpendicular to the interface ) of a ns superlattice by using the exact expressions of the transfer matrix . as a demonstration ,",
    "here we consider the homogeneous case with the total number of layers being ten .",
    "one sees that a repeated main andreev peak is already seen around @xmath235 , resembling the repeated structure when crossing the zone boundary in infinite systems .",
    "note that these repeated structures may not be exhibited in real experiments as the dephasing length could easily get shorter in higher voltage .",
    "nevertheless the main andreev peak at zero - bias will still be a special feature to superconducting superlattices .",
    "_ most importantly , unlike the width of the andreev peak in the ns junction , the width of the andreev peak can be much less than _ @xmath62 .",
    "this is due to destructive interference of the andreev reflections from all the superconductors . as the normal",
    "metal diminishes , the separation between these andreev peaks increases , and eventually , only the one at the zero bias survives . at the same time",
    ", the width of the andreev peak extend to @xmath62 .",
    "in addition to this feature , there are also small oscillations between these andreev peaks",
    ". these oscillations are also results of the interference from all the interfaces .",
    "they have fixed period in terms of energy as demonstrated in fig .",
    "it is tempting to make an analogy between the ns superlattice and the diffraction gratings ( each superconductor cell seems to be analogous to a slit in the grating ) .",
    "however , crucial differences do exist and make the interference in the ns superlattice system more complicated : ( i ) the andreev reflection from each superconductor has to pass all other superconductors in front of it to get to the electrode where the interference happens .",
    "( ii ) the incident wave that arrives at each superconductor has to pass all other superconductors in front of it . as a result",
    ", a precise dependence of the separation and the width on @xmath101 and @xmath102 are complicated and can only be computed numerically .",
    "nevertheless , in a special limit in which @xmath101 is large and @xmath102 is very small , one may disregard @xmath102 in computing the phase .",
    "the result is similar to that for the diffraction grating : because the path between successive superconducting cells is @xmath236 ,  we have @xmath237 ^{2}. \\label{diffraction}\\ ] ] therefore , the positions of  the main andreev peaks are independent of the number of layers @xmath174 and are located at @xmath238 with @xmath239 being nonnegative integers . on the other hand , the minima are located at @xmath240 with @xmath239 being nonnegative integers , and hence the width of the andreev peak is @xmath241 .",
    "all of these results can be explicitly checked numerically .",
    "7(d ) is a simple demonstration in which the calculated @xmath5 curve based on eq.([diffraction ] ) is compared with that based on the exact calculation .",
    "one sees that eq.([diffraction ] ) gives excellent results in the lower energy sector .",
    "note that for large @xmath101 , the andreev peak gets sharper and becomes more like a zero - bias resonant conductance peak .",
    "this is very different from the other limit when @xmath101 goes to zero , where the andreev peak is a plateau , extending from zero - bias to @xmath242 .",
    "we now analyze the is superlattice .",
    "essentially , the @xmath5 curve for the is superlattice has a similar behavior as shown in fig .",
    "7(e ) in which an andreev peak sits at the zero - bias , _ with reduced width_. the difference is that the small oscillations now sit in a rising background .",
    "the reason for this rising behavior is due to that when @xmath7 increases , the insulators becomes more transparent so that the conductance increases .",
    "the differential conductance shown fig.7(e ) resembles a recent observed data in a underdoped bscco sample@xcite .",
    "this resemblance suggests that a is superlattice is more appropriate to model the c - axis transport in the underdoped regime .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effects of the superlattice structure on the single particle transport along the c - axis of the high tc superconductors . based on superlattice models that consist of metals / insulators and d - wave superconductors ( ns / is superlatives )",
    ", we find that  a crucial difference between the ns superlattice and the is superlattice lies in the positions of the quasi - particle peaks in the measurement of density of state . in the large mass anisotropy limit of the metal for the ns superlattice ,",
    "the density of state in the low energy section is still bulk d - wave like except that the position of the quasi - particle peak is reduced considerably , while for the is superlattice , the quasi - particle peak remains at the gap value .",
    "the width of the andreev peak at zero - bias in the planar junction measurement is also shown to be affected strongly by the superlattice structure .",
    "it is found that this width can be considerably reduced due to the destructive interference of the andreev reflections from all the superconductors .",
    "in addition to this feature , there are also distinct oscillations with smaller amplitudes extending out from the main andreev peak",
    ". most importantly , for the is superlattice , these oscillations sit in a rising background , in consistent with experiments .",
