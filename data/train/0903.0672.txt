    "beginning with a two - antenna very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) observation of  by @xcite , a variety of absorption studies over the past three decades have found au - scale optical depth variations in the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the initial detections were confirmed by @xcite , and the first images of the small - scale in the direction of and  were made by @xcite using .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to improve the resolution toward a number of sources to approximately 20  mas ( @xmath4  au ) .",
    "significant variations were detected in the direction of and , while no significant variations in opacity were found in the direction of five other compact radio sources .",
    "an independent means of probing small - scale neutral structures is multi - epoch absorption measurements of high proper motion pulsars @xcite . while early pulsar observations suggested that small - scale structure might be ubiquitous",
    ", more recent observations suggest that it could be more sporadic .",
    "a significant advantage of vlbi observations is that they provide 2-d images of the opacity variations , rather than 1-d samples as in the case of pulsars observations .",
    "@xcite revisited the observations of , by re - analyzing the 1995 vlba observations @xcite and by obtaining two new epochs of observations ( 1999 and  2002 ) .",
    "they confirmed the initial results of @xcite , that there are small - scale opacity changes along the line of sight to at the level of @xmath5 , with typical sizes of roughly 50  mas ( @xmath6  au ) .",
    "however , with multiple epochs and improvements in data analysis techniques ( yielding an increase of a factor of  5 in the sensitivity of the 1995 epoch ) , they reached a number of additional significant conclusions :    1 .",
    "they found clear evidence for temporal variations in the opacity over the seven - year time span of the three epochs , consistent with structures moving across the line of sight at velocities of a few tens of kilometers per second , though the infrequent sampling in time means that they could not determine whether these structures were persistent .",
    "2 .   they found no evidence for a drop in the spin temperature , as would be evidenced by a narrowing of line widths at small scales compared to single dish measurements . in turn",
    ", a constant spin temperature implies that the small - scale opacity variations are due to density enhancements , although these enhancements would necessarily be extremely over - pressured relative to the mean interstellar pressure , far from equilibrium , and likely of relatively short duration .",
    "3 .   for the first time they determined",
    "that the plane of sky covering fraction of the small - scale gas is roughly 10% . in turn , this small covering fraction suggests that the volume filling factor of such gas , within the cold neutral medium , is quite low ( @xmath7% ) , in agreement with hst observations of high - pressure gas in the ism @xcite .",
    "they simulated pulsar observations that have been used to search for opacity variations and showed that the existing pulsar observations have generally been too sparsely sampled ( in time ) to be useful in studying the details of small - scale opacity variations .",
    "while the multi - epoch study of @xcite represented a substantial improvement , nonetheless their conclusions rested on observations of only one line of sight . in light of this sample of one",
    ", their conclusions might seem rather audacious , particularly given the larger sample observed by @xcite and @xcite , in which most of the objects did not show variations in the absorption .",
    "the study has shown that the key to a successful small scale study is a background source with both high surface brightness ( @xmath8  ) and large angular extent ( @xmath9  mas ) .",
    "the quasar  is one of the few sources that shares these characteristics with .",

    "four separate spectral windows or intermediate frequency bands ( ifs ) were used , with one if centered on the absorption line ( at an approximate lsr velocity of  @xmath10 ) and three ifs separated by at least 100  in velocity in order to sample the 21  cm continuum emission . for the 1998 epoch ,",
    "the data were correlated with velocity channels of  0.4  , with a bandwidth of  500  khz per if over  256  spectral channels ; for the 2005 epoch , improvements in the correlator allowed the number of spectral channels per if to be increased to  512 , with a concomitant improvement in the velocity resolution to  0.2  .",

    "the most significant difficulty , however , was that only one of the epochs was phase - referenced .",
    "there was an apparent offset in the core position between the two epochs ( with a magnitude of a fraction of the synthesized beam width or a few milliarcseconds ) that biased any attempt to compare results from the two epochs ( e.g. , comparing the integrated line profiles ) .",
    "consequently , we did not make use of the phase - referenced data for constructing the line profile or opacity images . one obvious impact on our results",
    "is that the sensitivity of the 2005 epoch line data is less than it could have otherwise been due to the phase - referencing cycling between  and .",
    "two of the three continuum ifs were then averaged together and several iterations of hybrid imaging ( iterative imaging and self - calibration ) were performed . after the final iteration of self - calibration ,",
    "the phase and amplitude solutions were applied to the if containing the line .",
    "the line - free velocity channels in this if were averaged together to produce a continuum data set , which underwent a final round of hybrid imaging , the solutions from which were applied to the velocity channels containing the line .",
    "finally , the continuum emission was subtracted from the velocity channels containing the line and the resulting line data set was imaged .",
    "we also reprocessed the observations of @xcite in a similar fashion .",
    "a significant difference from the original analysis of @xcite is that we used the continuum image from the 2005 epoch as an initial model for fringe fitting the 1998 epoch data ( for which no phase referencing was performed ) .",
    "the combination of a better initial model and improvements in the imaging software and analysis procedures led to a substantial improvement in the reprocessed 1998 epoch data .",
    "the noise in the 1998 epoch continuum image has improved by nearly an order of magnitude , and the improvement in the spectral line images is a factor of a few . as was the case for , the original analysis found a significantly higher peak brightness than we do , by a similar factor ( @xmath17% ) . like @xcite ,",
    "we attribute this difference to the use of a point source model by @xcite in the original fringe fitting along with other details of the subsequent imaging and self - calibration .    following the procedure of @xcite , both the continuum images and continuum - subtracted line cubes were convolved to  10  mas resolution .",

    "spatially significant changes in the column density between the two epochs are clearly apparent for all of the components , at significance levels exceeding @xmath31 over most of the face of the source .",
    "we have also conducted an analysis in which we consider a constant column density cross - cut to be the null hypothesis . in a @xmath32 sense",
    ", the null hypothesis can be firmly rejected as typical values , for both epochs and all velocity components , are @xmath33 ( reduced @xmath32 ) .",
    "typical angular scales for column density variations are approximately 15  mas , corresponding to a linear scale of approximately 10  .",
    "@xcite discussed the possible systematic effects that might affect the extraction of reliable optical depth or column density variations from dual - epoch imaging such as presented here .",
    "we do not repeat their discussion , but consider many of the same issues and conclusions to hold .",
    "namely , while small differences in the images from epoch to epoch may be due to the details of the observations and data reduction ( e.g. , spatial frequency or @xmath18-@xmath19 coverage , slight differences in the imaging ) , a number of steps were taken during the analysis in an effort to minimize the differences between the epochs , and the column density variations are significant .    the column density fluctuations in figures  [ fig : cross_major][fig : slices_major ] correpond to peak - to - peak optical depth variations as large as @xmath34 , and typical optical depth variations on scales of approximately 15  mas ranges from 0.10.3 .",
    "the associated uncertainties in the optical depth are @xmath35 , implying significant variations at the 3@xmath36 level , and the column density cross - cuts indicate variations at even higher significance are present .",
    "further , the magnitude of the variations is approximately correlated with the strength of the average absorption toward , in that the largest variations are observed at  @xmath25  , followed by 0.4  , with the smallest variations at  @xmath24  ( cf.figures  [ fig : profile ] and [ fig : cross_major][fig : slices_minor ] ) .",
    "the opacity variations toward show changes that are consistent with motion of structures across the line of sight @xcite , though there is considerable uncertainty with making these identifications ( as they discuss ) .",
    "possible motions of structures across the line of sight toward  are also visible in the cross - cuts .",
    "examples of such motions include the features at distances between  50 and  100  mas ( figures  [ fig : slices_major ] ) .",
    "caution in interpreting these features as arising from motions is clearly warranted , however , given that we have only two epochs .",
    "nonetheless , typical position shifts appear to be of the order of  5  mas . over the 7  yr interval between observations ,",
    "the implied proper motion is just under 1  mas  yr@xmath12 , equivalent to a velocity of order 3  , at a distance of  750  pc . for comparison , and recognizing that there is considerable uncertainty in these comparisons , @xcite find larger values for the apparent velocities of structures toward ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "one of the motivations for undertaking these observations was to assess whether the optical depth variations , both spatial and temporal , found by @xcite toward indicated that the line of sight to that source was in some sense `` special '' or anomalous .",
    "comparison of figures  [ fig : fluctuationi ] and  [ fig : fluctuationii ] and figures  [ fig : cross_major][fig : slices_minor ] with the corresponding ones from @xcite show that they are qualitatively similar , with clearly significant opacity or column density variations occurring both in space and time .",
    "quantitatively , there are modest differences in the opacity / column density variations between  and .",
    "we estimate that the typical angular scale of opacity variations is 15  mas ( @xmath38  au ) , as opposed to about  50  mas ( @xmath39  au ) toward , though the linear scales are comparable .",
    "the magnitude of the variations toward  also seems somewhat smaller . optical depth changes ( both in space and time ) , and corresponding column density fluctuations , are a factor of a few to several larger for optical depth changes of  0.4 and larger ( @xmath40  @xmath3 ) for vs.  optical depths typically not exceeding 0.3 ( @xmath41  @xmath3 ) for .",
    "@xcite used their observations of to conclude that the ( two - dimensional ) _ covering factor _ of small - scale opacity variations was about  10% , from which they inferred a three - dimensional filling factor of probably less than 1% .",
    "although the optical depth variations appear qualitatively similar for lines of sight toward and , we have repeated their analysis in order to determine the covering and filling factors for the line of sight to .",
    "figure  [ fig : fill ] shows the fractional number of pixels in a optical depth channel image for the three different velocities at both epochs .",
    "most of the opacity variations are at a level less than about  0.2 in optical depth , and we do not consider them significant . restricting to optical depth variations larger than approximately 0.2 ( @xmath42 ) , most of the covering fractions are about  10% , ranging from a low value of a few percent to a high exceeding 25% .    while we have decomposed the optical depth profile into gaussian components , our decomposition is likely not unique and we fit only for three components , whereas figure  [ fig : profile ] clearly shows that there are could be more components .",
    "thus , a plausible upper limit to the volume filling factor of the small - scale absorbing gas is obtained by assuming that there are multiple components , each of which contributes equally .",
    "we obtain an upper limit of  1% , a value which , as @xcite emphasize , is not directly measurable .",
    "we have presented two epochs of observations of the optical depth across the face of the source  on scales of approximately 10  mas .",
    "the motivation for these observations was assessing whether spatial and temporal opacity variations found in multi - epoch observations of by @xcite were in some sense `` special '' or anomalous .",
    "we find qualitatively similar opacity and column density variations toward  as were found toward .",
    "quantitatively , the variations toward  appear to be somewhat smaller in angular scale ( 15  mas vs.  50  mas ) and smaller in magnitude ( by a factor @xmath43 ) .",
    "while the typical angular scale of the variations toward  appears smaller , the absorbing gas may be more distant than that causing the absorption toward (  [ sec : observe ] ) .",
    "if so , the resulting linear scales are comparable ( 10  au for  vs.  25  au for ) , though the uncertainties are large .",
    "further similarities are observed in the covering and filling factors of the small - scale absorbing gas toward both sources . for both lines of sight ,",
    "the covering factor appears to be approximately 10% , and the volume filling factor , while not measured directly , has a plausible upper limit of  1% ( and potentially much less ) .    both and  display significant opacity variations across their faces , implying variations within the ism on scales of about  10 to  50   over path lengths ranging from  100 to  1000  pc .",
    "using , @xcite also have resolved significant opacity variations across the faces of , , and  , implying structure on scales of  50 to  500  .",
    "we conclude that the conditions that cause such small - scale variations are fairly widespread within the galactic .",
    "the reason that so few other sources display such small - scale opacity variations is likely to be , as @xcite discuss , that few sources other than and have the combination of angular extent and surface brightness required to conduct these observations .",
    "one unfortunate implication of this conclusion is that milliarcsecond - scale observations of other sources will largely not be useful for probing the small - scale structure without a significant increase in sensitivity .",
    "one possible target , particularly with the existing high sensitivity array ( hsa ) , may be .    in one aspect ,",
    "however , the lines of sight to  and do differ .",
    "for the analysis , @xcite used optical depth velocity channel images whereas , for , we fit the optical depth line cube with gaussian components and used the resulting column density images .",
    "this difference in approach was motivated by the velocity structure that was apparent within an component in the  optical depth line cube .",
    "we have not been able to find a ready explanation for this difference .",
    "both sources are seen toward the galactic anticenter , with galactic coordinates ( longitude , latitude ) of ( 1617 , 103 ) for  and ( 1874 , @xmath44 ) for , respectively .",
    "to first order , the lines of sight to both cut almost perpendicular to the perseus spiral arm .",
    "further , were velocity crowding the explanation , it would seem that that should be more of an issue for than for .",
    "we have also consulted the wham h@xmath45 survey and the green supernova remnant ( snr ) catalog @xcite , reasoning that h@xmath45 and snrs might serve as a tracers of turbulence injected by winds or explosions from massive stars .",
    "there are no obvious indications that the line of sight to  should be affected any such turbulence ",
    "indeed a comparison of the and  lines of sight suggest that the line of sight to would be _ more _ likely to be the one that would display any such evidence of turbulence .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the kinematic differences between these two lines of sight reflect small - scale features , and possibly the past history of the gas .",
    "@xcite imaged the emission around the line of sight toward  at  1  resolution ( @xmath46  pc linear scale ) .",
    "they found a series of filaments and small clumps of emission , and they were able to associate at least some of the absorption features with small emission clumps .",
    "the amount of small - scale structure ( in emission ) toward  is not generally observed in the on - going galfa survey at arecibo .",
    "further , @xcite find that a large fraction ( @xmath47% ) of the in emission in the direction of  has a temperature of  5002000  .",
    "at this temperature , the gas would be thermally unstable .",
    "while the warm is not responsible for the absorption , the possibility that this line of sight contains thermally unstable is consistent with a scenario in which the microphysics , and potentially the past history of the gas , leads to kinematic variations within an absorption component .",
    "@xcite also suggested a relative distance ordering of the gas .",
    "comparison of the opacity variations ( figures  [ fig : cross_major][fig : slices_minor ] ) suggests that the opacity variations are smallest in amplitude for the @xmath24  velocity component and increase in magnitude for the 0.4  and the @xmath25  velocity components .",
    "one interpretation is that the opacity variations result from structures of essentially constant size , which are comparable to or smaller than the equivalent linear size of our beam ( @xmath4  au ) .",
    "if this were the case , we could obtain a relative distance ordering of the gas , with the @xmath25  material being the nearest , followed by the 0.4  material , and the @xmath24  material being the most distant . an alternate interpretation",
    "( see above ) would attribute these differences to the history of exposure of the gas to shocks or other interstellar disturbances .",
    "whichever is the case , there is clearly significant structure on large scales ( @xmath48  pc ) , suggesting that such structure could persist to smaller scales .",
    "the combination of vlba and vla data ( as well as potentially merlin data ) might be able to explore the connection between the small- and large - scale opacity variations .",
    "@xcite have set an upper limit ( 3@xmath36 ) on the magnetic field toward  of @xmath49 , based on zeeman effect measurements in spectra . under the standard assumption that discrete structures require densities @xmath50  @xmath51 @xcite , with a typical velocity width of @xmath52 ( figure  [ fig : profile ] and table  [ tab : profile ] )",
    ", one concludes that magnetic and turbulent equipartition requires a magnetic field strength of order , well above the observed upper limit . as for the optical depth variations toward 3c  138 @xcite , the optical depth variations can not be in magnetic and turbulent equilibrium , unless there is significant blending and dilution of the magnetic field on the angular scales over which the zeeman effect measurements were made .",
    "our observations of  do not produce any new constraints on the nature of the small - scale structures vis - a - vis whether they represent `` statistical '' fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , `` non - equilibrium '' physical structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or discrete `` tiny scale atomic structures '' @xcite . while the level of opacity variations toward  are lower than those toward , we believe that this lower level can be accommodated easily within any of these scenarios .",
    "a wide range of opacity variations might be expected if these result from non - equilibrium processes , particularly because the level of opacity variations could depend upon the history of the gas .",
    "also , as @xcite note , the predicted level of opacity variations within a statistical description depends sensitively upon the assumed spectral index of the underlying power law ; within the current uncertainties for this spectral index , a large range of opacity variations is allowed .    what would be required in order to place significant constraints on these small - scale opacity variations ?",
    "ideally , one should monitor the same volume of gas and determine how the structures evolve . in the most simple comparison",
    ", discrete structures should show only linear motion across the line of sight , while fluctuations or non - equilibrium physical conditions might also cause the appearance of the opacity variations to change significantly .",
    "the elapsed times between observations presented here and those in @xcite range from  3 to  7  yr . these intervals are only a few percent of the estimated time for discrete structures to change substantially ( @xmath53  yr , * ? ? ?",
    "however , on milliarcsecond scales , the line of sight to  effectively samples a volume through the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the sun s velocity through space causes this volume to move between our observing epochs ( figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) , in addition to any motion that the gas itself might have .",
    "a simple estimate of the sun s motion suggests that an entirely new volume through the galaxy could be sampled on time scales of approximately 3  yr .",
    "that is , in the typical interval between vlbi observations , essentially an entirely new volume of the galaxy is sampled by the line of sight .",
    "consequently , we also conclude that the time sampling of the existing multi - epoch vlbi observations has been too coarse to distinguish between the various models for the small - scale opacity variations .",
    "ideally , one would like to monitor the same volume of gas , to determine if the opacity variations appear to be simply in motion or also changing in appearance .",
    "we estimate that , for either and , an appropriate sampling interval is no longer than about  9  months , with even more rapid sampling desirable .",

    "<S> this paper reports dual - epoch , very long baseline array observations of absorption toward . </S>",
    "<S> one of these epochs ( 2005 ) represents new observations while one ( 1998 ) represents the reprocessing of previous observations to obtain higher signal - to - noise results . </S>",
    "<S> significant opacity and column density variations , both spatially and temporally , are observed with typical variations at the level of @xmath0 and in some cases as large as @xmath1 , corresponding to column density fluctuations of order @xmath2  @xmath3 for an assumed 50  k spin temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the typical angular scale is 15  mas ; while the distance to the absorbing gas is highly uncertain , the equivalent linear scale is likely to be about  10  . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 10% of the face of the source is covered by these opacity variations , probably implying a volume filling factor for the small - scale absorbing gas of no more than about  1% . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our results with earlier results toward ( @xcite ) , we find numerous similarities , and we conclude that small - scale absorbing gas is a ubiquitious phenomenon , albeit with a low probability of intercept on any given line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> further , we compare the volumes sampled by the line of sight through the galaxy between our two epochs and conclude that , on the basis of the motion of the sun alone , these two volumes are likely to be substantially different . in order to place more significant constraints on the various models for the origin of these small - scale structures , more frequent sampling is required in any future observations . </S>"
