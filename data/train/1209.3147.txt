    "the cosmological data from type ia supernova , large scale structure(lss ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) indicate that our universe is currently accelerating @xcite .",
    "to explain such an acceleration in the framework of standard cosmology , one is required to introduce a new type of energy with a negative pressure usually called  dark energy \" ( de ) in the literature . a great variety of de scenarios",
    "have been proposed to explain the acceleration of the universe s expansion .",
    "one can refer to @xcite for a review of de models . on the other hand , many people believe in a modification of gravity , seeking an explanation for the late time acceleration . according to this idea the acceleration will be a part of the universe s expansion and does not need to invoke any kind of de component . as examples of this approach",
    "one can look at refs .",
    "it is important to note that the detection of gravitational waves should be the ultimate test for general relativity or alternatively the definitive endorsement for extended theories @xcite .    in most scenarios for de",
    ", people usually need to consider a new degree of freedom or a new parameter , in order to explain the acceleration of the cosmic expansion ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . however , it would be nice to resolve the de puzzle without presenting any new degree of freedom or any new parameter in the theory .",
    "one of the successful and beautiful theories of modern physics is qcd which describes the strong interaction in nature .",
    "however , resolution of one of its mysteries , the u(1 ) problem , has remained somewhat unsatisfying .",
    "veneziano ghost field explained the u(1 ) problem in qcd @xcite .",
    "vacuum energy of the ghost field can be used to explain the time - varying cosmological constant in a spacetime with nontrivial topology , since the ghost field has no contribution to the vacuum energy in the minkowskian spacetime @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the vacuum ghost field is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the qcd mass scale and @xmath7 is the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the cosmological constant model of de suffers the coincidence and the fine tuning problems .",
    "however , with correct choice of @xmath6 , the ghost dark energy ( gde ) model does not encounter the fine tuning problem anymore @xcite .",
    "phenomenological implications of the gde model were discussed in @xcite . in @xcite gde in a non - flat universe in the presence of interaction between de and dark matter was explored .",
    "the instability of the gde model against perturbations was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the perfect fluid for gde is classically unstable against perturbations .",
    "other features of the gde model have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in all the above references ( @xcite )",
    "the gde was assumed to have the energy density of the form @xmath8 , while , in general , the vacuum energy of the veneziano ghost field in qcd is of the form @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that in the previous works on the gde model , only the leading term @xmath7 has been considered .",
    "motivated by the argument given in @xcite , one may expect that the subleading term @xmath10 in the gde model might play a crucial role in the early evolution of the universe , acting as the early de .",
    "it was shown @xcite that taking the second term into account can give better agreement with observational data compared to the usual gde .",
    "hereafter we call this model the generalized ghost dark energy ( ggde ) and our main task in this paper is to investigate the main properties of this model . in this model",
    "the energy density is written in the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "in addition to the de component , there is also another unknown component of energy in our universe called `` dark matter '' ( dm ) .",
    "since the nature of these two dark components are still a mystery and they seem to have different gravitational behaviour , people usually consider them separately and take their evolution independent of each other .",
    "however , there exist observational evidence of signatures of interaction between the two dark components @xcite .    on the other hand , based on the cosmological principle the universe has three distinct geometries , namely open , flat and closed geometry corresponding to @xmath13 , respectively . for a long time it was a general belief that the universe has a flat ( @xmath14 ) geometry , mainly based on the inflation theory @xcite . with the development of observational techniques people found deviations from the flat geometry @xcite . for example ,",
    "cmb experiments @xcite , supernova measurements @xcite , and wmap data @xcite indicate that our universe has positive curvature .",
    "all the above reasons indicate that although people believe in a flat geometry for the universe , astronomical observations leave enough room for considering a nonflat geometry .",
    "also about the interaction between dm and de there are several signals from nature which guides us to let the models explain such behaviour .",
    "based on these motivations we would like here to extend the studies on ggde , to a non - flat frw spacetime in the presence of an interaction term .",
    "our work differs from @xcite in that we consider the ggde model while in @xcite and @xcite , the original gde model in einstein and brans - dicke theory were studied , respectively . to check the viability of our model",
    ", we also perform the cosmological constraints on the interacting ggde in a non - flat universe by using the marko chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we use the following observational datasets : cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) data from wmap7 @xcite , @xmath15 union2 dataset of type ia supernova @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data from sdss dr7 @xcite , and the cluster x - ray gas mass fraction data from the chandra x - ray observations @xcite . to put the constraints ,",
    "we modify the public available cosmomc @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section iii , we study the cosmological implications of the ggde scenario in the absence of interaction between de and dm . in section [ intflat ] ,",
    "we consider _ interacting _ ggde in a flat geometry . in section [ nonflatint ]",
    ", we generalize the study to the universe with spacial curvature in the presence of interaction between dm and de . in section [ constraints ] , cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are performed by using the marko chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sum ] .",
    "consider a flat homogeneous and isotropic frw universe , the corresponding friedmann equation is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , the energy densities of pressureless dm and de , respectively . the generalized ghost energy density may be written as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 is qcd mass scale , and @xmath12 is also a constant . in the original gde ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 gives the right order of magnitude @xmath27 for the observed de density @xcite . in the ggde",
    ", @xmath12 is a free parameter and can be adjusted for better agreement with observations .    as usual",
    "we introduce the fractional energy density parameters as @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the first friedmann equation as @xmath30 through this section we consider ggde in the absence of the interaction term , thus de and dm evolves independent of each other and hence they satisfy the following conservation equations @xmath31 if we take the derivative of relations ( [ fried ] ) and ( [ ggde ] ) with respect to the cosmic time , we arrive at @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 . combining relations ( [ hdot ] ) and ( [ dotrho ] ) with continuity equation ( [ consd ] ) , we get @xmath35=4\\pi g ( \\alpha+2\\beta h).\\ ] ] solving the above equation for @xmath1 and noticing that @xmath36 , and @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear that this relation reduces to its respective one in the gde when @xmath40 @xcite . in fig .",
    "1a we have plotted the evolution of @xmath1 versus @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to see that at the late time where @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 , which implies that the ggde model mimics a cosmological constant behaviour .",
    "one should notice that this behaviour is the same as for the original gde model .",
    "this is expected since the subleading term @xmath10 in the late time can be ignored due to the smallness of @xmath7 and the difference between these two models appears only at the early epoches of the universe . from figure ( 1a )",
    "we see that @xmath1 of the ggde model can not cross the phantom divide and the universe has a de sitter phase at the late time .",
    "it is important to note that the universe is filled with two dark components namely , dm and ggde . thus to discuss the acceleration of the universe we should define the effective eos parameter , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the total energy density and the total pressure of the universe . as usual , we have assumed the dm is in the form of pressureless fluid ( @xmath48=0 ) . using relation ( [ fridomega ] ) for the spatially flat universe , one can find @xmath49 let us now turn to the deceleration parameter which is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the scale factor . using eq .",
    "( [ hdot ] ) and definition @xmath41 in ( [ omega ] ) we obtain @xmath52 replacing this relation into ( [ q1 ] ) , and using ( [ wd ] ) we find @xmath53 one can easily check that the deceleration parameter in gde is retrieved for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we can also take a look at the early and the late time behaviour of the deceleration parameter . at the early stage of the universe",
    "where @xmath54 , the deceleration parameter becomes @xmath55 which indicates that for @xmath56 the universe is at the deceleration phase at early times while for @xmath57 , the universe could experience an acceleration phase , the former is consistent with the definition @xmath39 . on the other side",
    ", we find that at the late time where the de dominates ( @xmath42 ) , independent of the value of the @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 .",
    "we have plotted the behaviour of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ i1]b . besides , taking @xmath61 and adjusting @xmath62 we obtain @xmath63 , in agreement with observations @xcite . choosing the same set of parameters leads to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "one should note that as we already mentioned about @xmath1 , the squared term in the ggde density has a negative contribution in the role of the de in the universe .",
    "we mean by negative contribution that arises by taking the squared term into account , the evolution of the universe will be slowed .",
    "for example , the universe will enter the acceleration phase later than the original gde .",
    "this behaviour is clearly seen in both parts of fig .",
    "[ i1 ] .    at the end of this section we present the evolution equation of the de density parameter @xmath41 . to this goal",

    "( [ wd ] ) we get @xmath68 once again for the limiting case @xmath40 , the above relation reduces to its respective evolution equation for the original gde presented in @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , the evolution of the de and dm components were discussed separately . here",
    "we would like to extend the study to the interacting case , seeking new features of ggde . in the first look investigating interacting models of de are valuable from two perspective .",
    "the first is the theoretical one , which states that we have no reason against interaction between de and dm components .",
    "for example , in the unified models of field theory dm and de can be explained by a single scalar field , thus they will be allowed to interact minimally . besides , one can get rid of the coincidence problem by taking into account the interaction term between dm and de .",
    "one can refer to@xcite for detailed discussion .",
    "the other feature which motivates us to consider interacting models of de and dm comes from observations which indicate the interaction between two dark components of our universe @xcite .",
    "thus , there exist enough motivations to consider the ggde in the presence of an interaction term . to this end ,",
    "we start with the energy balance equations for de and dm , namely @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the interaction term which allows the transition of energy from de to dm . the form of @xmath71 is a matter of choice and can be taken as @xcite @xmath72 with @xmath73 being a coupling constant .",

    "( [ wd ] ) .",
    "when @xmath40 the result recovers those in @xcite for original gde .",
    "the first interesting point about the eos parameter of the ggde is that in the interacting case independent of the interaction parameter , @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , @xmath1 can cross the phantom line in the future where @xmath79 . at the present time , by choosing @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath61 , we find that @xmath82 and @xmath83 which the latter favored by observations",
    ". one can easily check that for a same coupling constant these values for the original gde are @xmath84 and @xmath85 which clearly show that the square term in the energy density of the ggde slow down the evolution of the universe compared to the original gde model . for a better insight we have plotted @xmath1 against @xmath41 in fig .",
    "this value for coupling constant , @xmath77 , in the figure is consistent with recent observations @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at the late time where @xmath79 the effective eos parameter approaches less than @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 , which reminds a super acceleration for the universe in the future .",
    "next we take a look at the deceleration parameter in the presence of an interaction term . substituting ( [ doth ] ) in ( [ q1 ] ) and using ( [ wd4 ] ) yields @xmath88 once again it is clear that setting @xmath76 , the respective relation in the previous section is retrieved . when @xmath40 the result of @xcite is recovered . for the set of parameters ( @xmath89 ) , we find that according to the ggde the universe enters the acceleration phase at @xmath90 while this transition happens earlier for the gde model .",
    "this point is clear from fig.[i2]b .",
    "the present value of the deceleration parameter for the interacting ggde model is @xmath91 which is consistent with observations @xcite .",

    "the flatness problem in standard cosmology was resolved by considering an inflation phase in the evolution history of the universe .",
    "following this theory it became a general belief that our universe is spatially flat .",
    "however , later it was shown that exact flatness is not a necessary consequence of inflation if the number of e - foldings is not very large @xcite .",
    "so it is still possible that there exists a contribution to the friedmann equation from the spatial curvature , though much smaller than other energy components according to observations .",
    "thus , theoretically the possibility of a curved frw background is not rejected .",
    "in addition , recent observations support the possibility of a non - flat universe and detect a small deviation from @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath94 represents the contribution to the total energy density from the spatial curvature and it is constrained as @xmath95 with @xmath96 confidence level by current observations @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the generalized quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ghost model of dark energy in the framework of einstein gravity . </S>",
    "<S> first , we study the non - interacting generalized ghost dark energy in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , the deceleration parameter , and the evolution equation of the generalized ghost dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in this case , @xmath1 can not cross the phantom line ( @xmath2 ) and eventually the universe approaches a de - sitter phase of expansion @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we extend the study to the interacting ghost dark energy in both a flat and non - flat frw universe . we find that the equation of state parameter of the interacting generalized ghost dark energy can cross the phantom line ( @xmath4 ) provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably . finally , we constrain the model parameters by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method and a combined dataset of snia , cmb , bao and x - ray gas mass fraction . </S>",
