    "the luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) relation for nearby dwarf irregular galaxies has been studied traditionally at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the dispersion in the optical @xmath1@xmath2 relation is affected by variations in stellar mass - to - light ratios , which are caused by variations in the current star formation rate among galaxies . to minimize the effects of these variations , we determine the @xmath1@xmath2 relation at near - infrared wavelengths where stellar populations dominate the emission .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ spitzer space telescope _ provides an excellent opportunity to observe the total near - infrared emission from the stellar populations in nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "the present results are based on observations taken with irac in channel 2 ( 4.5  ) ; we assume that the contribution from warm and/or small dust grains at 8  is negligible in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have measured 4.5  luminosities for 25 galaxies taken from gto program 128 ( p.i .",

    "located within the local group and other nearby groups , these galaxies have measured distances ( @xmath0 mpc ) and oxygen abundances .",

    "[ lee : fig1]a and b , respectively .",
    "the dispersion in the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation is reduced at near - infrared wavelengths compared to the dispersion in the optical relation . by comparison with the optical @xmath1@xmath2 relation for more massive galaxies @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    ", it appears that the dispersion in the optical @xmath1@xmath2 relation is similar ( @xmath4 0.16  dex ) over 11 magnitudes in optical luminosity .",
    "with measured luminosities at 4.5  , we have derived stellar masses for our sample of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "we have used the models from bell & de jong @xcite to determine stellar mass - to - light ratios as functions of @xmath5 color , and we have applied a correction for nonzero @xmath6 $ ] color in late - type dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . we have also adjusted the derived stellar masses to the kroupa @xcite stellar initial mass function ; additional details of the derivation are provided in @xcite .",

    ", we have extended the sdss @xmath3@xmath2 relation to lower stellar mass by 2.5  decades .",
    "we find that the dispersion in the @xmath3@xmath2 relation is comparable ( @xmath7 0.100.12 dex ) over a range of 5.5 decades in stellar mass , although we have not performed a homogeneous treatment of gas - phase metallicities and stellar masses for the sdss sample ; see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "we have plotted the effective yield as a function of total baryonic mass in fig .",
    "[ lee : fig2]b .",
    "the simple closed - box model of chemical evolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) predicts that the effective yield is equal to the true yield for all masses .",
    "however , that the effective yield decreases at lower baryonic mass is commonly interpreted as a signature of either outflow or dilution from the infall of metal - poor gas .",
    "we find that the present sample of dwarf galaxies exhibits a much larger variation in the effective yield at a given total baryonic mass .",
    "the large variation in the effective yield is difficult to explain if galaxy outflows are dominant in low - mass dwarf galaxies ; see @xcite for a countering view .",
    "stellar masses for our sample of dwarf galaxies have been derived from near - infrared luminosities under the assumption that the emission is dominated by the populations of older stars .",
    "iron abundances are a good tracer of the chemical evolution for these stars integrated over the entire history of past star formation .",
    "we have constructed an @xmath1@xmath2 relation using photometric stellar iron abundances from the literature to examine if the correlation is comparable to the relation constructed using gas - phase metallicities .",
    "the iron abundance - luminosity relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ lee : fig3 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the photometric iron abundances have large uncertainties or spreads .",
    "nevertheless , there appears to be a trend between the mean photometric iron stellar abundance and the measured galaxy luminosity at 4.5  in the same sense as that found in fig .",
    "[ lee : fig1 ] .",
    "the challenge is explaining the relatively uniform scatter in both the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath2 relations . additional near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy for",
    "a large number of dwarf galaxies within the local volume can test whether the scatter in the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath2 relations holds over a large range in luminosity and mass .",
    "the growing interest in determining the redshift - evolution of the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath2 relations provides good impetus to exploring galaxy formation models that incorporate varying degrees of galaxy outflows and can predict the slope and the scatter in the @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath2 relations over large dynamic range ."
