    "the _ little hierarchy problem _ , i.e. the problem of hierarchy between a low ( @xmath0 ) higgs mass and a quite high ( @xmath1 ) standard model ( sm ) cutoff scale indicated by electroweak ( ew ) precision measurements , has been one of the main motivations to elaborate models of new physics ( np ) . while supersymmetry is at present the leading candidate , different proposals have been formulated more recently . among them , little higgs models play an important role , being perturbatively computable up to about @xmath2 and with a rather small number of parameters .    in little higgs models@xcite",
    "the higgs is naturally light as it is identified with a nambu - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry , whose gauge and yukawa interactions are incorporated without generating quadratic one - loop mass corrections , through the so - called _ collective symmetry breaking _ ( csb ) .",
    "indeed , the csb has the peculiarity of generating the higgs mass only when two or more couplings in the lagrangian are non - vanishing , thus avoiding one - loop quadratic divergences .",
    "diagrammatically , the csb is realized through the contributions of new particles with masses around @xmath3 , that cancel the sm quadratic divergences .",
    "the most economical , in matter content , little higgs model is the littlest higgs ( lh)@xcite , where the global group @xmath4 is spontaneously broken into @xmath5 at the scale @xmath6 and the sm ew sector is embedded in an @xmath7 non - linear sigma model .",
    "gauge and yukawa higgs interactions are introduced by gauging the subgroup of @xmath4 : @xmath8_1 \\times [ su(2 ) \\times u(1)]_2 $ ] . in the lh model ,",
    "the new particles appearing at the @xmath9 scales are the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath10 ) , the heavy top ( @xmath11 ) and the scalar triplet @xmath12 .    in the lh model ,",
    "however , ew precision tests are satisfied only for quite large values of the np scale , @xmath13@xcite , due to tree - level heavy gauge boson contributions and the triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the lh model can be reconciled with ew precision tests by introducing a discrete symmetry called t - parity@xcite , which acts as an automorphism that exchanges the @xmath8_1 $ ] and @xmath8_2 $ ] gauge factors .",
    "as t - parity explicitly forbids the tree - level contributions of heavy gauge bosons and the interactions that induced the triplet vev , the compatibility with ew precision data can be obtained already for smaller values of the np scale , @xmath14@xcite .",
    "another important consequence is that particle fields are t - even or t - odd under t - parity .",
    "the sm particles and the heavy top @xmath15 are t - even , while the heavy gauge bosons @xmath16 and the scalar triplet @xmath12 are t - odd .",
    "additional t - odd particles are required by t - parity : the odd heavy top @xmath17 and the so - called mirror fermions , i.e. , fermions corresponding to the sm ones but with opposite t - parity and @xmath18 mass .",
    "mirror fermions are characterized by new flavour interactions with sm fermions and heavy gauge bosons , which involve two new unitary mixing matrices in the quark sector , @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 , and two in the lepton sector , @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24@xcite .    because of these new mixing matrices , the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) does not belong to the minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) class of models@xcite and significant effects in flavour observables are possible .",
    "other lht peculiarities are the rather small number of new particles and parameters ( the sb scale @xmath25 , the parameter @xmath26 describing @xmath15 mass and interactions , the mirror fermion masses and @xmath19 and @xmath22 parameters ) and the absence of new operators in addition to the sm ones . on the other hand , one has to recall that little higgs models are low energy non - linear sigma models , whose unknown uv - completion introduces a theoretical uncertainty reflected by a left - over logarithmic cut - off dependence@xcite in @xmath27 processes .",
    "several studies of flavour physics have been performed in the lht model in the last three years , for both quark@xcite and lepton sectors@xcite .",
    "they show that the lht mirror fermion interactions can yield large np effects in the quark sector , mainly in @xmath28 and @xmath29 rare and cp - violating decays@xcite , and that even larger np effects are possible in the lepton sector@xcite .",
    "the smallness of ordinary neutrino masses , in fact , assures that the mirror fermion contributions to lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) decays represent by far the dominant effects .",
    "in@xcite we have studied the most interesting lfv processes : @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 , the six three - body decays @xmath34 and the rate for @xmath35 conversion in nuclei .",
    "we have also calculated the rates for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the number of significant experimental constraints on flavour violating decays is rather limited in the lepton sector .",
    "basically only the upper bounds on @xmath41@xcite , @xmath42@xcite , @xmath43@xcite and @xmath44@xcite can be used in our analysis .",
    "the situation may change significantly in the coming years thanks to near future experiments@xcite . meanwhile , we have estimated the lht effects , imposing the experimental bounds mentioned above and scanning over mirror lepton masses in the range @xmath45 $ ] and over the parameters of the @xmath22 mixing matrix , with the symmetry breaking scale @xmath25 fixed to @xmath46 or @xmath47 in accordance with ew precision tests@xcite .",
    "we note that for @xmath47 also the very recent experimental upper bounds on @xmath48 given in @xcite , where belle@xcite and babar@xcite results have been combined , become effective .",
    "we have found that essentially all the rates considered can reach or approach present experimental upper bounds@xcite . in particular , in order to suppress the @xmath49 and @xmath50 decay rates below the experimental upper bounds , the @xmath22 mixing matrix has to be rather hierarchical , unless mirror leptons are quasi - degenerate .",
    "moreover , following the strategy proposed in@xcite in the supersymmetric framework , we have identified certain correlations between branching ratios that are less parameter dependent than the individual branching ratios and could provide a clear signature of the model .",
    "in particular , we find that the ratios @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 could allow for a transparent distinction between the lht model and the mssm ( see table  [ tab : comparison ] ) .       finally , we have studied the muon anomalous magnetic moment finding that , even for values of the np scale @xmath25 as low as @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "this value is roughly a factor @xmath56 below the current experimental uncertainty@xcite , implying that the possible discrepancy between the sm prediction and the data can not be solved in the lht model .",
