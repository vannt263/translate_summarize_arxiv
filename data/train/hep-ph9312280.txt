    "cosmic strings  @xcite are linear vortex defects predicted to be formed at a cosmological phase transition during which the vacuum manifold would not be simply connected .",
    "the first interest in studying them comes from the fact that since a typical grand unified theory ( gut ) predicts a few phase transitions ( whose order , as far as the strings are concerned , does actually not matter  @xcite ) , and because the vacuum structure needed to form strings happens to be generically realized , one can , following vilenkin  @xcite , reasonnably assume that cosmic strings have an existence probability of at least @xmath1 . although they are not the only possible topological defects that could be formed in such phase transitions , they have the advantage , as compared for instance with domain walls and monopoles which must be somehow inflated away  @xcite , to be at present compatible ( as are as well the textures  @xcite ) with all existent cosmological data  @xcite , while being also possibly responsible for the formation of large scale structure  @xcite and the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmbr )  @xcite .",
    "most models based on these strings assume that they are generated at the gut phase transition , so that the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the newton constant and @xmath4 the energy per unit string length , giving the expected relative order of magnitude of any gravitational effect due to these strings ( e.g. , light deflection  @xcite or cmbr temperature fluctuations  @xcite ) , was assumed to be @xmath5 .",
    "another kind of strings was proposed by witten  @xcite in 1985 who pointed out the possibility that bosonic or fermionic superconducting currents could be trapped in the strings , thereby inducing many electromagnetic effects , such as , for instance , a new scenario for structure formation  @xcite .",
    "shortly thereafter , it was shown by davis and shellard  @xcite and independently by carter  @xcite that , although the regular strings can not be potentially responsible for a cosmological catastrophe ( i.e. , the remnant mass density would not exceed the critical density ) because of gravitational radiation and the absence of any stabilising mechanism , the situation was completely different for current - carrying string loops since in the latter case , there exists centrifugally supported equilibrium configurations ( called vortons  @xcite or rings  @xcite ) which would overfill the universe  @xcite by many orders of magnitude if they were stable ( a point which still demands further clarification and is presently under investigation  @xcite ) , this stabilizing mechanism being enhanced when electromagnetic corrections are taken into account  @xcite , and should not be confused with the much less efficient `` spring '' , or magnetostatic support mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the witten mechanism to produce currents in cosmic strings has been studied by many authors , interested in particular by their internal microscopic structure  @xcite , and who exhibited clearly the characteristic features of what should be expected in these objects , such as the existence of a maximum ( spacelike ) current ( or the current quenching phenomenon ) and a phase frequency threshold ( for timelike currents ) .",
    "independently , a `` macroscopic '' formalism  @xcite was derived that allows one in principle to evaluate the dynamics of any current - carrying string configuration once its equation of state , relating the energy per unit length @xmath4 to the tension @xmath6 , is given .",
    "this equation of state , for the witten simple model describing strings , and whose properties are believed to be qualitatively ( if not quantitatively ) similar to more complicated ( and realistic ) strings models , was indeed obtained ( albeit unfortunately only numerically ) , so that it has now become possible to study realistically the cosmological importance of superconducting cosmic strings , and their astrophysical , gravitationally induced , signature , since the structure of the spacetime surrounding a string of any kind is also known  @xcite .    the purpose of this article is to show that there exists yet another mechanism by which a string can become not only superconducting , but also current - carrying without invoking any extra external field ( e.g. , electromagnetic ) , hence the name spontaneous current generation for this mechanism , comparable in many respects to a similar mechanism existing in @xmath7he vortex lines  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs for particular values of the underlying microscopic parameters , when the current - carrier field is neither a scalar nor a fermionic field ( these cases being essentially equivalent due to the two dimensional description of the vortex ) , but a charged - coupled vector field such as the intermediate @xmath8 in the electroweak theory . to illustrate this mechanism in the most realistic possible way",
    ", we shall consider a simple string - forming extension  @xcite of the standard electroweak theory  @xcite ( this latter model being string - free since its vacuum manifold , isomorphic to the 3sphere @xmath9 , is simply connected ) .",
    "other motivations  @xcite such as supersymmetry or superstrings inspired models also lead , generally as a low energy limit , to the model we wish to consider , namely that in which an extra@xmath10 is gauged , this new symmetry being spontaneously broken .",
    "it is interesting to notice that because of the large number of experimentally testable phenomenological consequences of such a model , the energy scale of the symmetry breaking involved @xmath11 say , and thus the energy per unit length of the corresponding strings , is in fact constrained to exceed  @xcite 300    500  gev ( depending on the couplings ) , which is actually close to the upper limit provided by the vorton mechanism  @xcite , namely @xmath12  tev .",
    "we shall first introduce our string forming model , as well as the vortex solutions themselves , in the simple case to begin with where no current is flowing in the strings , i.e. , the so - called nielsen ",
    "olesen  @xcite solutions , or kibble type vortices .",
    "then we go on the spontaneous current generation itself which is shown to be be due to an electromagnetic instability of the vacuum for massless @xmath0 field at zero temperature , and finally discuss how the phenomenon is responsible for a spontaneous breaking of the lorentz boost symmetry along the initially kibble - like string .",
    "the electroweak theory  @xcite is based on the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath13 symmetry by means of an @xmath14 doublet higgs field @xmath15 down to the electromagnetic @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "this means that the vacuum has the topology of the quotient group @xmath16 , which is isomorphic to @xmath14 , i.e. , it has the topology of the 3sphere and is therefore simply connected . as a result ,",
    "topologically stable cosmic strings are not present in this model ( and in fact , due to the experimental bound on the higgs mass @xmath17  gev  @xcite , even string - like solutions in this model are dynamically unstable  @xcite ) . in order to investigate the structure of cosmic strings in a realistic model that would take the electroweak theory into account",
    ", it is thus necessary to modify this theory first .",
    "there are basically two different approaches that can be followed to extend this model .",
    "the first one consists in assuming the higgs realisation of the symmetry breaking not to be fundamental , and to consider instead dynamical symmetry breaking such as in the chiral approach  @xcite involving the @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "this leads to the existence of semi - topological defects [ because only one direction of @xmath19 is actually gauged ] , which may be shown  @xcite to be dynamically stable and moreover superconducting .",
    "the second approach , the one we shall follow , is to regard the higgs representation , and thus the higgs field @xmath15 itself , as fundamental , and to extend the gauge group .",
    "it turns out that the most simple such extension one can think of , consisting in an extra @xmath10 , also generates topologically stable ( and superconducting ) cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "the string - forming model we shall now examine is the following ( this section is essentially useful to fix the notation used throughout ) : initially , the symmetry @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 the extra hypercharge ) is broken down to @xmath13 by means of a higgs field @xmath22 , and this is followed by the usual electroweak phase transition .",
    "the model is minimal in the sense that we assign a vanishing @xmath21 hypercharge for the @xmath15 field , and symmetrically assume @xmath22 to be an @xmath14 singlet .",
    "we shall altogether neglect the fermionic sector of the model , but it may be remarked that the hypercharge @xmath21 , with the previous assignement made on the higgs fields , coincides with @xmath23 ( up to a normalisation factor absorbable in the fermionic fields ) in this sector , and that even though @xmath24 is broken , the baryonic and leptonic numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 are conserved . also the model will be anomaly - free provided one includes a right - handed neutrino .",
    "we therefore start with the lagrangian density ( again , without the fermions ) @xmath27 where the ( classical ) potential between the higgs fields is ( we assume that both phase transitions are second order so we neglect the logarithmic corrections  @xcite in this zero temperature effective theory , see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite on that point ) @xmath28 and we have set the covariant derivative @xmath29 with @xmath30 the generators of @xmath31 in the representation of the particle upon which the derivative acts , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the gauge coupling constants of @xmath31 , @xmath35 and @xmath24 respectively , and the kinetic terms of the gauge vectors are expressed through @xmath36 @xmath37 the higgs doublet is understood as @xmath38 , and its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is experimentally known to be @xmath39  gev .",
    "we are now interested in a vortex solution of this model , of the kind proposed by nielsen and olesen  @xcite , for the @xmath22 field .",
    "since we are concerned by classical solutions , it is necessary that we fix the gauges . for the string - forming fields ,",
    "there is a particularly convenient gauge choice : if the vortex solution is taken to be aligned along the @xmath40 axis ( which is always possible since the curvature effects can be locally neglected ) , we can choose a cylindrical coordinate system , and in this system , the phase of the @xmath22 field is identified with the angular coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "the nielsen  olesen vortex solution then takes the simple form @xmath42 with @xmath43 the winding number  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the electroweak fields .",
    "because of the disjoint structure of the initial invariance , we have not lost any freedom in going to the vortex gauge .",
    "we can thus choose the most convenient gauge with regard to the subsequent interpretation , namely the unitary gauge , in which only the neutral component of @xmath15 is considered : @xmath44 $ ] . before going any further in the resolution of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for this system , we wish to examine in more details what occurs in the strings core .",
    "the string solution is defined as the set of points in space where @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the vacuum ( or the false vacuum in the case of the strings core ) should represent a minimum of the potential  ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "varying this potential for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we see that the extremization yields two differents possibilities , namely , far from the strings core , i.e. , in the usual vacuum , @xmath48 whereas in the strings core with @xmath49 , then @xmath46 should satisfy ( not taking the kinetic terms into account for the moment ) @xmath50 from which we can conclude that two cases may occur in principle .",
    "the first case , already studied elsewhere  @xcite , is for @xmath51 , with @xmath52    which corresponds to a shift in the @xmath14 doublet higgs vev at @xmath53 . the second case , to which we now turn definitely , is for @xmath54 .",
    "if the underlying parameters are such that this inequality is satisfied , then there is no real solution to eq .",
    "( [ s - vac ] ) .",
    "thus , one finds that the real minimum of the potential is now at @xmath55 as long as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 [ given by inserting a nonzero value for @xmath58 into eq .",
    "( [ s - vac ] ) and solving for @xmath55 ] .",
    "1 illustrates the internal string structure which is obtained when the kinetic terms are included .",
    "this figure represents a solution of the field equations derived from the lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) under the gauge assumptions and with the vortex solution  ( [ no ] ) , with zero vector fields @xmath60 and @xmath61.this solution was obtained by means of a successive over relaxation method  @xcite , and the distances are in units of the inverse @xmath22 mass @xmath62 . more details concerning the numerical procedure itself and the stability of the solution can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here , and in particular in the next section , we shall be mainly interested in what occurs close to the strings core , namely the symmetry restoration .",
    "for the time being , let us just remark that since the higgs field @xmath46 is real , there is no associated current with it , so the fact that it be trapped in the string , its vev varying from @xmath53 to @xmath63 , merely changes the actual value of the string s energy per unit length , but otherwise does not break the lorentz boost invariance along the string .",
    "therefore , setting the stress - energy tensor in the form @xmath64    with @xmath65 and @xmath66 two unit timelike and spacelike vector respectively , tangent to the strings worldsheet , @xmath4 being the energy per unit length and @xmath6 the tension , the lorentz invariance requires , whether there is a higgs condensate or not , that the equation of state be that of goto  nambu , i.e. , @xmath67cte  @xcite .",
    "this is important because once the current - generation mechanism which we will investigate in the next section has been at work , this degeneracy in the stress - energy tensor eigenvalues is spontaneously raised , so the lorentz invariance is spoiled .",
    "the electroweak vacuum surrounding a cosmic string of the kind we just investigated is in fact not stable .",
    "this can be seen as follow : in the standard vacuum , the @xmath8 particles are charged and massive because of the higgs field @xmath15 vev .",
    "now , close to the string core , as we have just seen , this vev actually vanishes so the @xmath8 particles become charged and massless . as a result , they can be created by pair through any fluctuation of the electromagnetic field , but since they are charged , they can actually be considered themselves as the sources for these electromagnetic fluctuations . more precisely , as will be shown in this section , fluctuations in the @xmath0 field yield a corresponding nonvanishing @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with nonzero gradients .",
    "this implies nonzero electric and magnetic fields which are used as negative masses for the @xmath0 particles .",
    "the vacuum surrounding a cosmic string is thus unstable and there is a spontaneous current generation in the form of @xmath0 flowing along the strings .    to see how this phenomenon actually occurs ,",
    "let us concentrate on the stress energy tensor @xmath70 given by @xmath71    and in particular the energy density @xmath72 .",
    "setting as usual  @xcite @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and using the vortex ansatz  ( [ no ] ) gives , if one considers only a configuration where radial electric and orthoradial magnetic fields are present ( i.e. , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 the only nonvanishing components of the photonic and the @xmath69 fields ) @xmath84 + w^-_{\\mu t } \\left [ w^{+\\mu } ( sa_t + c z_t ) - w^+_t ( sa^\\mu + c z^\\mu ) \\right]\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { 1\\over 2}ig\\left\\ { w^+_{\\mu\\nu}\\left [ w^{-\\nu } ( sa^\\mu + c z^\\mu ) - w^{-\\mu } ( sa^\\nu + c z^\\nu ) \\right ] + w^-_{\\mu\\nu } \\left [ w^{+\\mu } ( sa^\\nu + c z^\\nu ) - w^{+\\mu } ( sa^\\nu + c z^\\nu ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 1\\over 4}g^2h^2(|w_r|^2 + |w_z|^2 + { 1\\over r^2 } |w_\\theta |^2 + |w_t|^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ig[(sa'_z + cz'_z)(w_r^- w^+_z - w_z^-w^+_r ) + ( sa'_t + cz'_t)(w_r^- w^+_t - w_t^-w^+_r ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & - & g^2 \\big\\ { \\big| ( sa_z + cz_z ) w^+_z + ( sa_t+cz_t)w^+_t \\big| ^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 1\\over 2}(w^+_r w^-_t - w^-_r w^+_t ) ^2 + { 1\\over 2}(w^+_z w^-_t - w^-_z w^+_t ) ^2 + { 1\\over 2}(w^+_r w^-_z - w^-_r w^+_z ) ^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & { 1\\over 2 r^2 } \\left [ ( w^+_r w^-_\\theta - w^-_r w^+_\\theta ) ^2 + ( w^+_z w^-_\\theta - w^-_z w^+_\\theta ) ^2 + ( w^+_t w^-_\\theta - w^-_t w^+_\\theta ) ^2 \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & - & ( |w_r|^2 + |w_z|^2 + { 1\\over r^2 } |w_\\theta |^2 + |w_t|^2 ) \\left [ ( sa_z + cz_z)^2 + ( sa_t+cz_t)^2 \\right ] \\big\\ } , \\label{bigu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a prime means differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath85 .",

    "( [ wr ] ) , ( [ wz ] ) and  ( [ wt ] ) , it is now simple to derive the effective potential for the @xmath0 field , namely : @xmath106    so this field effectively behaves as a higgs `` scalar '' in the region of parameter space where its squared mass is negative .",
    "this is indeed possible close to the strings core since there , as we have seen , still in the case where @xmath107 , the higgs field @xmath46 vanishes , so to first order in @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) implies that @xmath108 is actually negative .",
    "thus , any fluctuation in @xmath0 , the latter being coupled with the photon , will generate a small fluctuation in @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which , if the initial perturbation was axisymmetric , will produce an electric or a magnetic field .",
    "since @xmath0 is effectively massless in the core of the string , the energy in the electromagnetic perturbation is already sufficient to create a pair @xmath113 , which can in turn be seen as the source for the electromagnetic fields . since these electromagnetic fields are necessary to support the @xmath0 condensate in the strings core , one is led to the conclusion that a current has been spontaneously generated .",
    "we shall now investigate in more details this mechanism .",
    "to exhibit the instability of the electroweak vacuum surrounding a nielsen - olesen string  ( [ no ] ) , we turn to the euler - lagrange equations derivable from the lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) , which we expand to first order in the coupling constant @xmath32 and to lowest order in the various fields involved to consider the case of a perturbation in @xmath96 [ given by eq .",

    "the spontaneous current generation mechanism we have just discussed has in fact many interesting consequences , including , we believe , cosmological ( notably in the framework of the vorton problem  @xcite which becomes even more unavoidable in this context ) , and in this section , we wish to emphasize a particular effect , namely that generating a current this way breaks the lorentz boost invariance along the string spontaneously .",
    "the basic reason that this occurs is that the particle that gets trapped in the string is in fact a @xmath167 , i.e. , a vectorial particle , and a nonvanishing vev for a vector picks a privileged direction in space time . also we shall exhibit the internal microscopic structure of the string and compare it with what is obtained in the simple witten  @xcite bosonic toy model .    as was already said , the current generation phenomenon will spontaneously break the lorentz boost symmetry along the string : before the @xmath0 condenses in the strings core , the energy per unit length and the tension are both equal so a boost in the @xmath40 direction does not change the physics of the system .",
    "now , when a perturbation in @xmath0 is applied , as we have just seen , the @xmath0 and @xmath68 fields vev increase exponentially , so the degeneracy of the stress energy tensor is raised exponentially as times passes by , until again the system reaches a stationnary configuration .",
    "it is therefore an actual spontaneous mechanism because it does not require any external field and it needs not even exist in the expanding universe ( as is the case for the usual symmetry breaking higgs mechanism ) .",

    "however , the eigenvectors @xmath181 and @xmath182 of the stress energy tensor  ( [ tmn ] ) are both null and the definition of the eigenvalues as energy per unit length and tension becomes unclear .",
    "investigation of such lightlike currents in strings is posponed for future work  @xcite .    therefore , in general , as was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the knowledge of the energy per unit length and the tension in the particular cases @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , @xmath186 will be sufficient for macroscopic applications .",
    "for these two cases , it turns out that @xmath4 and @xmath6 ( without the tilde , i.e. , after diagonalization of the stress tensor , this operation corresponding to choosing [ @xmath170 , @xmath187 or [ @xmath168 , @xmath188 ) actually depend on the gauge fields @xmath189 and @xmath190 only through the new field functions @xmath191    and the orthogonal field @xmath192    where @xmath193 denotes either @xmath40 or @xmath194 depending on to whether one considers a magnetic or an electric state respectively , and where the parameter @xmath195 is not in fact arbitrary since it is given by @xmath196 . as a result ,",
    "the realistic string model given by the lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) is nearly as simple as the witten  @xcite bosonic toy model in the sense that out of the initial 18 field functions ( @xmath47 , @xmath46 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath189 , and @xmath199 ) , the internal microscopic structure is fully determined by the knowledge of 6 field functions [ @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 and two free parameters , namely the winding number @xmath43 and the state parameter @xmath206 .",
    "this is to be compared to the original witten bosonic model whose structure needs the knowledge of already 4 field functions and the same two free parameters , and with very similar field equations . thus we believe that , apart from the spontaneous current generation mechanism discussed in the present article , most qualitative conclusions regarding this simple model should apply as well to this more realistic model .",
    "in examining the internal structure of cosmic strings arising in the most simple string - forming extension of the standard electroweak model , we have found that , because of the nonabelian nature of @xmath207 , the field @xmath0 can condense spontaneously in a strings core if the coupling constant between the string - forming higgs field and the usual @xmath14 doublet higgs is less than a critical value .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in the following way : for certain values of the coupling constants between the string forming higgs field @xmath22 and the @xmath14 doublet higgs field @xmath15 , the latter has a vanishing vev close to the strings core , so the initial @xmath207 symmetry is restored .",
    "therefore , the intermediate vector bosons , just like the photon , remains massless in this region .",
    "any exitation of the photon field will thus have enough energy to generate a pair @xmath113 through vacuum fluctuations . in turn , the effectively massless @xmath0 particle , being charged , is responsible for the existence of a nonvanishing electromagnetic field .",
    "this turns out to be in fact an unstable fluctuation mode , and nonzero vev for @xmath0 and the photon therefore build up spontaneously .    by using the field equations for the electroweak fields in the symmetry restored region , we have been able to exhibit explicitely this instability , and to estimate what we believe to be a lower bound on the time necessary for the current to be generated",
    "this timescale is , as expected , independent of the underlying string parameters provided the latter are such that the symmetry restoration mechanism actually occurs .",
    "it should be remarked that because the phenomenon here described is essentially electromagnetic and involves only the @xmath0 particle , the timescale found could have been deduced on dimensionnal ground , namely @xmath208 .",
    "although this is a huge time compared to the characteristic length of the string if the underlying string forming theory is at gut scale , it is still sufficiently short to be irrelevant for cosmological considerations .",
    "thus , current - carrying strings seem quite generic in string - forming gut models since the potential  ( [ pot ] ) is in fact very general even as a low energy limit and , as we have seen , the current formation mechanism is independent of the background string structure .",
    "considering the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the present calculation , it can be concluded that for any value value of the coupling between the string forming theory and the electroweak fields , the resulting strings are superconducting in the sense of witten , whether the current builds up through tunneling ( high frequencies metastability  @xcite ) or instability .",
    "thus , if cosmic string exist , and if they are not arbitrarily decoupled from the low energy physics ( a requirement of `` naturalness '' ) , then , they are superconducting . since the present knowledge in high energy physics tells us that approximately half of the plausible gut theories contains cosmic strings , it means that we can estimate the existence probability of superconducting cosmic string to be also of the order 1/2 .",
    "a final remark seems appropriate at this point : the current generation we have exhibited here relies in fact entirely on the nonabelian nature of @xmath14 .",
    "this means that for a string forming gut , it will exist as well since gut models usually involve large unifying groups with nonabelian couplings , and various higgses",
    ". therefore , gauge bosons having masses of the order of the gut scale should spontaneously condense in the string core , within a timescale given this time by @xmath209 , where @xmath32 is the gut group coupling constant .",
    "the cosmological relevance of such effects is then obvious since many of these gauge bosons are responsible for baryon number violation , so that in particular , these strings would enhance the primordial baryon number asymmetry .",
