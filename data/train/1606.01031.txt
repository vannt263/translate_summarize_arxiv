    "many fields of research ranging from material physics to quantum information processing make use of microwave measurements at temperatures as low as few tens of millikelvin . to build microwave systems capable of operation at these low temperatures",
    "often requires the use of components specifically designed for such conditions . for active devices such as amplifiers ,",
    "the usual semiconductor - based designs dissipate too much power to be compatible with millikelvin temperatures @xcite , necessitating alternative approaches such as superconducting devices based on parametric amplification @xcite .",
    "an rf switch is another example of a device commonly used in room - temperature microwave systems , whose integration in cryogenic setups is problematic . latching mechanical switches have been successfully used for setups inside dilution refrigerators @xcite but the heat - load due to the solenoids used for moving the mechanical parts causes significant increase in temperature after each switching event and a rather long time of approximately @xmath4 is needed for the cryostat to reach its base temperature again .",
    "pin diode switches which need to be continuously current - biased during operation are even less suitable for low - temperature applications .",
    "the quickly developing family of mems microwave switches @xcite can provide very reliable switching with a minimal power dissipation and seems to be a good candidate for cryogenic microwave setups @xcite .",
    "similarly promising devices were recently demonstrated based on field - effect transistors @xcite . however , these types of switches can not be easily combined with on - chip superconducting circuits without a significant modification of the fabrication process .    on - chip switching devices will be a useful tool for construction of more complex integrated quantum systems and have a potential to enable a range of novel experiments .",
    "for example , in combination with measurement - based entanglement generation techniques , such as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , they could be used to create distributed multi - qubit entangled states . in experiments of the hong - ou - mandel type @xcite",
    ", microwave field states could be routed in a network of switches and beam - splitters to generate a range of different non - classical states using a single device .",
    "the ability to route signals on - chip can also provide a convenient way to calibrate a linear detection setup by fabricating a suitable source of a reference signal on the same chip as the device - under - test .    here",
    "we describe and experimentally test a microwave switch design which is integrated on a superconducting chip using fabrication procedures widely employed in the field of superconducting quantum circuits .",
    "devices of a similar type were recently implemented @xcite but are currently restricted to the single - pole , single - throw ( spst ) mode of operation .",
    "that is , they can either route a signal towards an output port or reflect it back to the input .",
    "in contrast , our switch is of the single - pole , double - throw ( spdt ) type  it switches a single input to one of two outputs or vice versa .",
    "the device is based on interference effects in a microwave circuit and has no moving parts .",
    "the expected internal loss rate in a superconducting circuit of this type @xcite is at least three orders of magnitude lower than the 3db bandwidth , which is on the order of @xmath0 in the device studied here .",
    "this bandwidth is smaller than that of mechanical or pin diode switches but sufficient for many applications encountered in superconducting circuit experiments .",
    "the device is controlled by externally applied magnetic flux which , if generated by an on - chip flux line , can be tuned on time - scales of a few nanoseconds @xcite , making the switching very fast as compared to typical coherence times of state - of - the - art superconducting circuits .",
    "this will make it useful in applications where routing of signals needs to be controlled by real - time feedback .",
    "the switch consists of two @xmath5 hybrid couplers @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "343 ) connected in a mach - zehnder - like configuration with two independently tunable coplanar waveguide resonators @xcite in the two arms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](a ) .",
    "the resonance frequencies of the resonators are tuned by changing the inductance of two arrays of @xmath6 squid loops placed in their centers ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "the inductance of these arrays depends on a magnetic flux applied using two superconducting coils .",
    "the hybrid coupler is a structure consisting of four transmission line segments of equal length with pairwise equal characteristic impedances arranged in a square ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](c ) ) .",
    "its effect on an incident microwave signal is analogous to that of an optical beam - splitter but the phases of the two resulting signals are phase - shifted with respect to each other by @xmath5 .",
    "the hybrid lends itself to a straightforward implementation in the planar architecture of superconducting circuits where it has been used for quantum optics experiments with single microwave photons @xcite .        for the following discussion ,",
    "we number the ports of the device according to fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](a ) .",
    "the signal entering port 1 of the top hybrid is split equally into its two output ports and arrives at the resonators .",
    "when both of them are far detuned from the signal frequency , they act as nearly perfect reflectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](b ) ) . due to the phase relation between the outputs of the hybrid ,",
    "the two reflected parts of the signal recombine in port 2 .",
    "this situation , corresponding to what we will call the _ off - resonant state _ of the switch , is schematically illustrated by solid arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](a ) .",
    "conversely , in the _ resonant state _ , both resonators are fully transmittive ( see fig .  [ fig_switch_diagram](b ) ) and the signal arriving at the bottom hybrid will recombine in port 3 , as shown by the dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](a ) .",
    "an array of @xmath7 squid loops can be approximated as an inductor of inductance @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the josephson energy of each squid , related to the josephson energies @xmath10 , @xmath11 of the junctions comprising the squid and the magnetic flux @xmath12 threading the loop by @xmath13 .",
    "the approximation by an inductor is valid only in the limit where the currents flowing across the junctions are small in comparison with their critical currents , that is , for sufficiently low signal powers . at higher powers , non - linear effects",
    "cause compression of the transmitted signal . since the higher - order corrections to the squid array energy scale as @xmath14 , using an array rather than a single squid loop improves the linearity of the device @xcite .",
    "our choice of @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_diagram](e ) ) is a compromise between suppression of non - linear effects , which favors high @xmath7 , and uniformity of the magnetic flux through the individual squid loops of the array , which is harder to achieve when the array is made longer .",
    "the switch is fabricated on a @xmath15 sapphire chip with the coplanar waveguide structures patterned by photolithography and etching of a niobium film ( see fig .  [ fig_switch_diagram](d ) ) .",
    "air - bridges , made in an additional optical lithography step by deposition of aluminium and titanium , are distributed along the transmission lines to suppress potential parasitic modes on the chip .",
    "the squid arrays ( see fig .  [ fig_switch_diagram](e ) ) are fabricated by electron - beam lithography and shadow evaporation of aluminium .",
    "a test chip with resonators in which the squids are replaced by an equally - sized niobium strip directly connecting the two resonator halves is measured in a dipstick at @xmath16 to determine the effective length of the resonator .",
    "the obtained resonance frequency of the fundamental mode is @xmath17 and its 3db bandwidth @xmath18 . in another test measurement at @xmath16 , the operating frequency of the hybrid couplers",
    "is found to be @xmath19 .",
    "the squid arrays consist of @xmath6 loops with a designed asymmetry ratio @xmath20 , chosen to yield a tuning ratio between the minimum and maximum @xmath9 of @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting frequency tuning range of approximately @xmath22 is sufficient to fine - tune the device to its optimal operating point but not much larger than necessary .",
    "this helps to keep the sensitivity of the resonator frequencies to external magnetic flux noise low .",
    "the josephson energies of the two junctions , extracted from a measurement of the flux - dependence of the resonator frequency ( see supplementary material ) , are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .    the experimental setup used in the initial characterization measurements of the switch is shown in fig .  [ fig_setup_diagram ] .",
    "the device is mounted at the base plate of a dilution refrigerator and cooled down to a temperature of @xmath25 .",
    "its ports 1 , 2 and 3 are connected to three input lines and one output line through a circulator as indicated in the figure .",
    "the remaining port 4 is terminated with a @xmath26 load .",

    "these are taken at the base temperature of the cryostat , with the sample removed and with the end of microwave line  1 left open or with line  2  or  3 connected via a short coaxial through to line  1 .",
    "magnetic flux bias of the squid arrays to tune the resonator frequencies is realized using two dc superconducting coils mounted on the sample holder underneath the two squid arrays .",
    "to achieve fast control of the flux , we use two on - chip flux lines ( see figs .",

    "to characterize the device , we first measure the transmission coefficient @xmath30 as a function of frequency .",
    "we expect this coefficient to be close to unity when both resonators are far detuned from the signal and to decrease when either of the resonators is driven resonantly . by doing this measurement for different bias voltages applied to one of the two coils ,",
    "we observe how the resonance frequencies change with magnetic field .",
    "the two lines visible in the measured dependence plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_spectrum](a ) correspond to the two resonators which couple to the coil with different strengths .",
    "the strongly coupled resonator shows approximately periodic behaviour of its frequency as expected from the dependence of the squid loop josephson energy on magnetic flux .",
    "the imperfect periodicity is consistent with a small inhomogeneity of the magnetic field threading the different loops in the array .",

    "we identify the two pairs of voltages for which the branching ratio @xmath36 is maximal and minimal .",
    "these operating points correspond to the off - resonant and the resonant state of the switch , respectively .",
    "the ability of the switch to block signal transmission into the unwanted port can be characterized by the on / off ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 between the transmitted powers in the resonant ( superscript on ) and off - resonant state ( superscript off ) .",
    "we evaluate these at the operating frequency of @xmath34 and obtain the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "we expect that this supression of approximately three orders of magnitude in power could be improved by increasing the tuning range of the resonators and optimizing the @xmath5-hybrid parameters .",
    "we estimate the bandwidth of the switch by measuring the transmission coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of frequency at the two operating points of the device , obtaining the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_switch_spectrum](b , c ) .",
    "we see that in the off - resonant state ( blue ) , the coefficients are relatively insensitive to frequency changes .",
    "this is to be expected because the signal is detuned from the resonance frequencies of the two resonators by more than @xmath41 , that is , by nearly ten times their linewidth . on the other hand , in the resonant state , the bandwidth of the device",

    ", we compare the results with a reference measurement obtained when the device is removed and the connector of port 1 is terminated with a cryogenic @xmath26 load , resulting in full absorption of the signal at the port .",
    "the power reflectance observed in this reference measurement is below @xmath45 within the @xmath46 wide band of the switch and we observe no systematic increase in this value when the device is connected , confirming that the reflections from the switch are small in comparison with the setup reflections .",
    "we determine the linear operating range of the device by tuning it into the resonant state , probing it resonantly and observing the transmittance between ports @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a function of the applied power .",

    ", we measure the transmittivity of the input cables with a vector network analyzer .",
    "however , since this reference measurement is taken at room temperature and the actual transmittance is likely to be higher due to reduced losses of the microwave components at low temperatures , the power calculated in this way most likely underestimates the actual power by a few db . as shown in fig .",

    "the non - linearity of the device can also be estimated theoretically from the properties of the josephson junctions forming the squid array ( see supplementary material ) . a calculation using the experimentally estimated junction parameters",
    "yields the kerr nonlinearity @xmath53 and the compression point @xmath54 for this device .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the measured value and we suspect the observed difference of @xmath55 to be caused by the reduced losses in the microwave lines at low temperatures .    to study the switching speed at shorter time scales than those achievable with the magnetic field coils , we use on - chip flux lines ( see figs .",
