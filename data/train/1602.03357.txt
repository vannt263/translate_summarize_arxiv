    "the common practice of setting experimental conditions resides on trial - error method performed by experimentalists while the subsequent data processing is not always taken into account .",
    "it is not a rare case that large amount of data is routinely generated without a clear idea about further data processing . here , we suggest to analyze simultaneously both the data ( i.e. , the processes hidden in data ) and the experimental protocol , aiming to establish the link between experimental conditions and the accuracy of our results .",
    "the whole idea is presented in a simplified case study of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) data processing .",
    "it serves as a paradigmatic example of the inverse problem of identifying the diffusion parameter from spatio - temporal concentration measurements .",
    "frap is a classical method used to study the mobility of fluorescent molecules in membranes of the living cells @xcite .",
    "the frap technique is based on measuring the fluorescence intensity , which is proportional to the non - bleached particles concentration in response to a high - intensity laser pulse .",
    "we suppose the laser pulse ( the _ bleach _ ) causes an irreversible loss in fluorescence of a certain amount of particles originally in the bleached area .",
    "the monitored region or the region of interest ( roi ) where the data are measured is usually an euclidean 2d domain containing the bleached area . after the bleach ,",
    "the change in fluorescence intensity in a monitored region is observed due to the transport of fluorescent compounds from the area outside the bleach as well as bleached particles from the bleached region to originally non - bleached regions . in general",
    ", we observe both recovery and loss in fluorescence in different regions corresponding to frap or flip ( fluorescence loss in photobleaching ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the natural question to be asked is : how does the bleach shape ( and topology ) influence the accuracy of resulting parameter estimates .",
    "therefore , the main focus of this study concerns the searching for the optimal bleach shape ( and its topology ) , or , from the more mathematical viewpoint , to optimize binary - valued initial conditions in a diffusion - parameter identification problem with respect to sensitivity .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in section 2 we provide the preliminaries for the further optimization problem formulation as well as the background information concerning the frap method . in section 3",
    "we rigorously formulate the optimization problem , evaluate the key term in the objective function and announce the proposition  3.2 , which allows to solve the problem efficiently .",
    "section 4 provides two numerical results : ( i ) set of solutions ( depending on the characteristic time of diffusion ) for an optimal setting of the bleached region shape and topology when the bleach depth is the only constraint , and ( ii ) corresponding results as in ( i ) when the total bleach energy is restricted as well .",
    "the novelty and benefits of our approach as well as outlooks for further research are resumed in the final section 5 .",
    "based on the spatio - temporal frap data , the so - called _ effective diffusion coefficient _ was estimated using a closed form model @xcite in past decades . nowadays , numerical simulations are preferred , cf .",
    "@xcite , mainly because there is no need for some unrealistic assumptions .",
    "further , we consider a normal fickian diffusion problem with a _ constant _ diffusion coefficient @xmath0 . in the setup of this paper , we assume a sufficiently large domain such that we can treat diffusion in the free space @xmath1 in frap , the simplest governing equation for the spatio - temporal distribution of fluorescent particle concentration @xmath2 is a diffusion equation without reaction term as follows : @xmath3 , \\label{one } \\\\",

    "\\omega & =   \\ { x \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^2\\,|\\ , \\|x\\| \\leq r \\}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] hence , the data are observed on a cylinder with radius @xmath6 and height @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 are fixed for the further analysis and not subject of optimization .",
    "although , in practice , it is often more convenient to consider an square spatial domain ( i.e. , an image ) , our cylindrical domain is a reasonable general model to indicate the most important conclusions in our further analysis .",
    "the data are insofar idealized as in experiments , they are given only at discrete points @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "however , for simplicity and as it was done in @xcite , we assume a sufficiently dense set of data points @xmath11 such that the model is valid with reasonable accuracy and such that certain sums over the data points can be approximately well by the corresponding integrals over @xmath12;$ ] see @xcite .    the equations   and the data are the basis for all the subsequent analysis , hence , although we mentioned frap as one important application , our results are of course applicable to other diffusion parameter identification problem which are governed by similar equations and data assimilation processes .",
    "based on the parameters @xmath13 , it is convenient to introduce the following scaling of the space and time coordinates : @xmath14 for later use we define a scaled version of the inverse of the diffusion coefficient , we have @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath16 the scaled concentration @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath18 , \\label{onesc } \\\\",

    "it can be shown , see @xcite and references within there , that for our case of single scalar parameter estimation and assuming white noise as data error , the expected relative error in @xmath4 depends on the data noise and a factor , which we call relative global sensitivity @xmath24 as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the noise variance ( and @xmath27 is related to the coefficient of variation or to the inverse of the signal to noise ratio ) , and @xmath28 is some ( chosen ) reference value of the observed output .",
    "the global relative squared sensitivity is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the usual sensitivity of the output observation data point @xmath11 with respect to the parameter @xmath4 and @xmath31 is the number of data points in space - time domain .",
    "it is obvious from this estimate that if the noise level is fixed , the estimation can be only improved by switching to an experimental design with a higher sensitivity .",
    "thus , the thrive for good estimators @xmath23 leads to the problem of experimental design optimization in order to maximize the sensitivity measure @xmath32 .",
    "the solution of this optimization problem , which is the central aspect of this article , is rigorously formulated and partially solved in the next section 3 .",
    "the sensitivity measure involves several design parameters .",
    "note that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are involved implicitly because the number of data points @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is defined by the pixel size and @xmath35 corresponds to the time interval between two consecutive measurements .",
    "however , if all the above parameters @xmath36 are fixed , there is only one way to maximize the sensitivity measure @xmath32 : considering the _ initial bleach _ @xmath37 in as the experimental design parameter . by optimizing the bleach design , we mean to select the initial conditions in such a way that @xmath32 is maximized and hence the expected error in @xmath4 minimized . in order to do so , we have to chose the class of designs out of which we take the initial conditions . in frap , it is the usual case that the initial bleach @xmath37 is a binary - valued function with fixed given values @xmath38 @xmath39 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath40 being a @xmath41-function , which also cancels out the term @xmath28 in @xmath32 , then the normalization of the signal , i.e. @xmath42 is actually done due to the division by the maximal value which signal @xmath43 can reach , cf . . ] : @xmath44 with some bounded open set @xmath45 , the _ bleach shape_. moreover , if the sum in the term @xmath32 is furthermore approximated by an integral @xmath46 then we have a final sensitivity term @xmath47 to be maximized : @xmath48    depending on the different restrictions imposed on the initial bleach , we study the following two setups :    * problem 1 : optimization with fixed bleach depth @xmath49 over the set of bounded open sets @xmath50 * problem 2 : optimization with fixed bleach depth and fixed energy @xmath51 @xmath52 given , over the set of bounded open sets @xmath50    note that these problems are shape ( and topology ) optimization problems , i.e. , the unknown bleach shape @xmath45 is the independent variable .",
    "however , the problems can be simplified by restricting @xmath45 to a radially symmetric shapes ; the reason for that is the following lemma .",
    "[ hh ] if solutions to the problems 1 and 2 exists , then there also exists radially symmetric solutions .",
    "in particular , if the solutions are unique , they must be radially symmetric .",
    "it is easy to see that the sensitivity measure @xmath47 is a convex functional of the initial conditions . from convex analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the optimization problems can be relaxed and expressed as problems with box constraints . in either case",
    ", the set of initial conditions can be relaxed to @xmath53 without altering the solution .",
    "indeed , this holds because a convex functional attains its maximum at the boundary , hence , by considering the relaxed constraints , a solution will be at the boundary of the admissible domain in and hence a @xmath54-function .",
    "thus , solutions of the relaxed problem are also solutions of the original problem ( and vice versa ) .",
    "due to our choice of an observation domain , the problem is invariant with respect to coordinate rotations , i.e. , the sensitivity does not change if the initial bleach is rotated . if @xmath40 is a solution to the optimization problem , then",
    "so is @xmath55 for any rotation @xmath56 around the origin with angle @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that taking the angle - averaged initial condition @xmath58 yields a solution to the relaxed optimization problem which is radially symmetric . because it must also be a solution to the original problem",
    ", the set @xmath45 must be radially symmetric .",
    "@xmath59    note that lemma  [ hh ] is not valid if the observation domain is not radially symmetric .",
    "when speaking to experimentalists , the result of lemma  [ hh ] is usually intuitively clear to them .",
    "however , a first guess for the optimal shape that is often uttered by them , is that it must be a `` disk '' ( or a ball ) .",
    "it is maybe the main conclusion of our work that this guess not always hits the truth as the optimal shape can be an annulus or multiple annuli as well ; see below .",
    "[ rem2.2 ]    let us mention several related design optimization problems . in a previous paper @xcite , the authors have considered the problem of optimizing the sensitivity with respect to the observation domain @xmath13 and also the problem of selecting reduced data that only little reduce the sensitivity @xmath32 .    in view of the initial conditions ,",
    "there are other classes of designs possible , for instance , if not binary - valued functions are used , then it is natural to optimize sensitivity with respect to a fixed energy ( i.e. , the @xmath60-norm ) of the initial conditions .",
    "that is , the problem @xmath61 with @xmath52 given .",
    "however , when analyzing this problem , one finds out that it does not have a solution .",
    "a sequence of almost optimal solutions will tend to a @xmath62-distribution .",
    "thus a @xmath62-peak is the `` optimal '' solution in this case .",
    "the sensitivity is infinite for this case , which is caused by the fact that the solutions are not square - integrable any more .",
    "thus , for a @xmath62-peak , one can not use the formula above for the expected error but have to used different , weighted norms ( for the data noise and the sensitivity ) .",
    "a similar problem is that one with a fixed @xmath63-norm .",
    "@xmath64 this one has an appealing interpretation as eigenvalue problem : indeed , let @xmath65 be the linear operator @xmath66)$ ] that maps the initial conditions to @xmath67 on the observation domain .",
    "it can be shown that this is a bounded linear and compact operator .",
    "the problem can be rephrased in functional analytic language as @xmath68)}^2   \\to \\max \\qquad \\text{with } \\|u_0\\|_{l^2({\\mathbb{r}}^2 ) } \\leq c_2.\\ ] ] it is well known that a solution exists and it is given by the right singular function associated to the largest singular value of @xmath65 .",
    "the associated optimization problem thus can be ( approximately ) solved by applying a standard singular valued decomposition to the discretized operator @xmath65 .",
    "going back to the optimization problems , problems  1 and 2 , it can be observed that the sensitivity @xmath47 is a quadratic functional with respect to @xmath37 . for the optimization it is important to have an efficient formula for @xmath47 available , since it has to be evaluated many times ( for different initial conditions ) .",
    "solving the pde  is not convenient in that respect .",
    "we rather stick to the integral representation by the green s function and derive a formula for the sensitivity @xmath47 in the next section .",
    "the formula for @xmath47 involves the derivative of the observation @xmath2 with respect to the diffusion parameter @xmath4 .",
    "either by differentiating  or , we find that @xmath69 because a convolution integral commutes with differentiation , we also find that @xmath70 in a similar way , we can derive a formula using the scaled variables : @xmath71 with @xmath72    now , in order to solve the above optimization problems ( problems 1 and 2 ) , we have to evaluate for many different initial conditions . therefore ,",
    "in the sequel we derive the kernel of the quadratic form associated to the sensitivity measure @xmath47 .",
    "consider two solutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 of  with the respective initial conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 we associate to them the scaled functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 as in .",
    "we calculate the following pairing of @xmath73 and @xmath79 @xmath80    in the next step we assume radially symmetric initial conditions and introduce polar coordinates : @xmath81 such that @xmath82 thus , @xmath83 by a substitution of @xmath84 by @xmath85 and @xmath86 by @xmath87 , the integrand does not depend on @xmath88 .",

    "this means that in this case , the functions @xmath113 attain the value @xmath114 on a number of intervals and @xmath115 else , and the associated initial condition is supported on a union of annuli and possibly a disk .",
    "we moreover assume that the function @xmath116 , which defines the initial conditions , has only jumps at @xmath117 places : @xmath118 , j = 1,\\ldots n , 0 \\leq r_1 < r_{j-1 } < r_{j } < r_{j-1 } ,   \\\\",

    "the case that @xmath120 means that @xmath37 has support in a disk around @xmath115 and clearly , there is no jump in the derivative there , hence this must be excluded from the sum .",

    "we obtain the following proposition .",
    "[ pr : one ] suppose that the initial conditions @xmath122 are radially symmetric @xmath54-valued with @xmath116 having finitely many jumps as in .",
    "then the sensitivity is given by @xmath123 with the kernel @xmath124 given by .",
    "note that we do not have to take into account if @xmath120 or not , because the kernel is @xmath115 if one of the arguments is @xmath115 .",
    "we remark that proposition  [ pr : one ] is also true for the case of @xmath116 having infinitely many jumps ; in this case we have to set @xmath125 .    by proposition  [ pr : one ]",
    "we find that    * problem 1 is equivalent to @xmath126 * problem 2 is equivalent to @xmath127      we try to solve the above problems numerically .",
    "note that we have the radii of the annuli / disks as variables and the number @xmath128 of them . as optimization routine we use the simplest and least sophisticated one , namely grid search over the radii restricting us to a finite number of annuli .",
    "in fact , we managed to search for the case @xmath129 and for radii restricted to @xmath130 on a sufficiently fine grid .",
    "we could not think of a smarter algorithm , but there are good reasons to believe that there is no fast algorithm available .",
    "in fact , by considering the relaxed problem and introducing the initial - to - sensitivity operator @xmath131 problem  1 is equivalent to @xmath132}^2 \\to \\max    \\qquad   \\text{under } 0 \\leq u_0 \\leq 1.\\ ] ] this is a convex _ maximization problem _ and it can be regarded as the problem of calculating the operator norm @xmath133 ( together with an additional positivity constraint @xmath134 ) . it is known that calculating this operator norm is an np - hard problem @xcite .",
    "this makes us believe that our optimization problems are hard problems indeed and that there is no simple efficient algorithm possible .",
    "let us mention that a classical method to tackle such shape optimization methods is the _ level set method _",
    "this could be applied as well here , but the problem is that this and related methods can only find _ local _ maxima . thus ,",
    "as we want to find _ global _ maxima , the level set method does not help much here .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ shape ] , we perform a grid search to solve problems  1 and  2 . for this",
    "we have to calculate the kernel @xmath109 for different values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 and also , to understand the parameter dependence of the results , for different values of @xmath137 .",
    "the results are calculated using matlab . depending on the grid for @xmath138 and @xmath139 according to , we have to calculate a double integral for each point on a 3-dimensional grid on @xmath140 .",
    "no doubt , that for this tasks the evaluation has to be done efficiently in order to have a reasonable runtime .",
    "when calculating the double integral in , we observe that matlab does not have an `` arrayvalued '' option for multidimensional integrals and hence the code can not be vectorized .",
    "this faces us with the problem that the 2-dimensional integral has to be calculated by for - loops over the grid , which , as is well - known , is usually extremely slow . as a remedy , we rewrite the problem as iterated integral and apply matlab s ode - solver ( which can be vectorized ) .",
    "indeed , from formula , it follows that the kernel satisfies @xmath141 with initial condition @xmath142 in this way we can use the ode - solver to handle the @xmath137-dependence and only have to calculate the one - dimensional parameter - dependent integral , where both steps can be vectorized .",
    "this gives a speed - up of a factor of about 10 compared to the for - loop and double integral approach .",
    "the only bottleneck is the calculation of the initial conditions in form of a 3-dimensional integral .",
    "however , this only has to be done on a 2-dimensional @xmath143 parameter grid ( compared to the initially 3-dimensional parameter domain including @xmath137 ) .",
    "we try to calculate the ( numerically ) optimal configuration for problem 1 .",
    "as explained above , we only have to consider radially symmetric initial conditions .",
    "we can not calculate all configurations but we restrict us to the case of at most @xmath144 radii .",
    "this means we consider initial shapes in the form of a disk ( @xmath145 ) , an annulus ( @xmath146 ) , an annulus with a disk inside ( @xmath147 ) , or a double annulus ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "other configurations with higher @xmath128 are excluded because of runtime considerations .",
    "however , the solutions indicate a pattern , which makes us believe that we have found the optimal configurations in the respective parameter setting of @xmath137 .",
    "we also note that we only have to evaluate the kernel @xmath124 because the sensitivity is only multiplied by a constant which only depends on the parameters @xmath149 .",
    "thus , with these values fixed , optimizing @xmath124 is the same as optimizing @xmath47 .",
    "let us come to the details of our calculations : we set up a grid for @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the interval @xmath150 $ ] with 100 equal - sized subintervals ( of length @xmath151 ) .",
    "for @xmath137 we set up a grid in the interval @xmath152 $ ] with 200 subintervals of length @xmath153 .",
    "then the kernel is calculated on these gridpoints ( exploiting symmetry in @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) . with the calculated kernel",
    ", we evaluate the functional for @xmath101 on the grid for problem 1 as given in proposition  [ pr : one ] for the cases @xmath154 and find the configuration that has maximal value . note that this testing requires up to 4 for - loops and",
    "is thus quite slow .",

    "let us explain the figure .",
    "the x - axis indicates the values of @xmath137 while the @xmath157-axis corresponds to the logarithm of the optimal value of the sensitivity for a fixed @xmath137 .",
    "the full lines in the figure display the log of the optimal value over @xmath137 and the associated colors encode which of the four possibilities ( @xmath158 ) are the optimal configuration ( violet : @xmath159 , green : @xmath146 , blue : @xmath160 , red : @xmath148 ) .",
    "it can be observed that there are clear intervals for @xmath137 where one specific configuration is always optimal . a value of @xmath137 where the shape of the optimal configuration changes ( e.g. , from disk to annulus ) is indicated by a vertical line .",

    "an even higher @xmath137 gives a annulus with a disk inside and for @xmath164 we find the double annulus as optimal .",
    "clearly a pattern can be observed , namely that for increasing @xmath137 the number of components of the optimal shape increases .",
    "we expect that for higher @xmath137 not in the range of our calculations , more complicated shapes ( e.g. with @xmath165 ) are optimal .",
    "although we tested only to @xmath148 the given pattern indicates that in the low range of @xmath139 the shapes with few components are indeed optimal because in the first interval @xmath161 $ ] we never found a better structure with @xmath166 .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we also indicated the log - values of the optimal sensitivity for each shape with fixed @xmath128 by a dotted line .",
    "for instance , the dotted continuation of the violet line from @xmath167 on corresponds to the optimal value within all disks ( i.e. @xmath168 ) the continuation of the green line corresponds to the optimal value within all annuli and so on .",
    "it can be observed that , for instance , in the range where the annulus is optimal , the value of the sensitivity is significantly higher than the best disk .",
    "roughly , the sensitivity of the best annulus is about twice that of the best disk .",
    "this indicates that in practice and for certain parameter setups , there can be a significant gain of confidence when using an annulus instead of a disk as initial bleach .    in the second figure ,",

    "we observe that in the majority of cases the double annulus is optimal , but this is only because we restricted ourselves to @xmath129 .",
    "it is to be expected that initial shapes with more annuli are optimal in general and the problem does not reveal an obvious pattern .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the plot has quite irregular regions with not always clearly defined boundaries .",
    "this can be an artefact of the discretization and we consider the plot only as rough indication of what is going on .    only in a tiny region around @xmath179 energy @xmath180",
    "we have a situation where the disk is optimal , but it is uncertain if this is a valid result or an artefact from our discretization and the interpolation of the energy values . as a summary ,",
    "it is quite likely that simple - shaped objects ( i.e. , those with small @xmath128 ) are rarely ( or even never ) optimal for problem  2 .",
    "although , we have a put some model assumptions like symmetric observation domain and simple diffusion with constant parameter , we think that our results are relevant and  with modification valid also in more general cases .",
    "in particular , when the observational domain is not a disk but an square , we expect the optimal bleach shape for problem  1 being a rounded square or several nested rounded squares , where the connectivity again increases with @xmath137 .",
    "for non - constant diffusion , the sensitivity is represented by a matrix and the optimal experimental design leads to the problem of maximizing some matrix norm of the inverse of the fisher information matrix .",
    "then , the optimal bleach shape for problem  1 might depend on several additional design setups like the basis representation of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "still it is not unlikely , that even in this case a similar pattern of optimal shapes with increasing connectivity emerges .",
    "our study started with the question : how does the bleach shape ( and topology ) influence the accuracy of resulting parameter estimates ?",
    "then the problem of the optimal initial shape for the identification of a constant diffusion parameter was formulated .",
    "as optimality criterion we choose to maximize a sensitivity measure in order to have the expected error minimal ; cf . .",
    "we studied two problems , the first with the fixed bleach depth and the second with an fixed energy as an additional restriction .",
    "we found out the analytical expressions for the sensitivity measure @xmath47 , cf .",
    "proposition 3.2 , allowing to compare different initial bleach shapes .",
    "our numerical calculations revealed rather surprising results .",
    "for the first problem without restriction on energy , a clear pattern is revealed . for small values of the scaled inverse diffusion coefficient",
    ", the disk is the optimal shape and for higher values , shapes with more and more components ( i.e. annuli - type shapes ) become optimal . in particular , the disk is not always the best shape . for practically relevant values of the parameters , sometimes an annulus can be better leading to a significant improvement in the confidence intervals . for the later problem with restriction on energy , is seems to have in most of the cases or even always only highly oscillating solutions .",
