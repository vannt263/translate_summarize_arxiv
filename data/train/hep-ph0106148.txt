    "minimal supersymmetric theories with r - parity conservation are particularly attractive for the study of dark matter as they predict the existence of a new stable particle which is the lightest r - odd state ( the lsp ) .",
    "furthermore , for parameter values of interest to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem , the lsp has an annihilation cross section which yields a relic density of cosmological interest @xcite .",
    "recent accelerator constraints have made a great impact on the available parameter space in the mssm and in particular the constrained version or cmssm in which all scalar masses are assumed to be unified at a grand unified scale @xcite .",
    "in addition , significant progress has been made concerning the relic density calculations @xcite .",
    "these issues were discussed in detail in john ellis contribution and will only be touched on briefly here .",
    "the main impact of the null searches , particularly at lep , is in the increase in the lower limit to the lsp mass as well as the rest of the sparticle spectrum .",
    "this has the unfortunate effect of lowering the elastic scattering cross sections for neutralinos on protons , making direct detection experiments more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we have now entered a period where accelerator constraints will be at a lull due to the transition from lep to the lhc and the time required for run ii at the tevatron to acquire the needed luminosity .",
    "therefore , during the next several years we can be hopeful that direct detection experiments will improve to make meaningful inroads to the supersymmetric dark matter parameter space .    in this contribution",
    ", we will discuss the current status of the expected neutralino - proton elastic cross sections in the mssm and cmssm .",
    "these results will be applied to the possibility of direct dark matter detection .    as noted earlier",
    ", we will restrict our attention to regions of parameter space for which the relic density of neutralinos is of cosmological interest .",
    "for an age of the universe @xmath0 gyr , there is a firm upper bound on the relic density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fraction of critical density in the form of neutralinos , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "this limit represents a strict cosmological bound on the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "we also focus our discussion on the parameter values which lead to relic densities with @xmath5 .",
    "while this does not place any bound on supersymmetry , it is a reasonable requirement for dark matter candidates .",
    "neutralinos with a lower density could not be the dominant form of dark matter in our galaxy , and therefore detection rates would necessarily be suppressed .",
    "as discussed here by john ellis , the neutralino lsp is the lowest - mass eigenstate combination of the bino @xmath6 , wino @xmath7 and higgsinos @xmath8 , whose mass matrix @xmath9 is diagonalized by a matrix @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "the composition of the lightest neutralino may be written as @xmath12 we assume universality at the supersymmetric gut scale for the gauge couplings as well as gaugino masses : @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 at the electroweak scale ( note that this relation is not exact when two - loop running of gauge sector is included , as done here ) .    we also assume gut - scale universality for the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses @xmath15 of the squarks and sleptons . in the case of the cmssm , the universality is extended to the soft masses of the higgs bosons as well .",
    "we further assume gut - scale universality for the soft supersymmetry - breaking trilinear terms @xmath16 . in the mssm",
    ", we treat as free parameters @xmath17 ( we actually use @xmath18 which is equal to @xmath17 at the unification scale ) , the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar mass scale @xmath19 ( which in the present context refers only to the universal sfermion masses at the unification scale ) , @xmath16 and @xmath20 . in addition , we treat @xmath21 and the pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath22 as independent parameters , and thus the two higgs soft masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are specified by the electroweak vacuum conditions , which we calculate using @xmath25  gev .",
    "in contrast , in the cmssm , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are set equal to @xmath15 at the gut scale and hence @xmath21 ( up to a sign ) and @xmath22 are calculated quantities , their values being fixed by the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions .",
    "the mssm lagrangian leads to the following low - energy effective four - fermion lagrangian suitable for describing elastic @xmath3-nucleon scattering  @xcite : @xmath26 this lagrangian is to be summed over the quark generations , and the subscript @xmath27 labels up - type quarks ( @xmath28 ) and down - type quarks ( @xmath29 ) . the terms with coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 make contributions to the elastic scattering cross section that are velocity - dependent , and may be neglected for our purposes .",

    "<S> current expectations for elastic scattering cross sections for neutralinos on protons are discussed with particular attention to satisfying all current accelerator constraints as well as insuring a sufficient cosmological relic density to account for the dark matter in the universe .    </S>",
