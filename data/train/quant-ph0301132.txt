    "a register @xmath6 is composed of @xmath7 systems , each having an @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "initially , every of these @xmath7 systems is with probability @xmath11 prepared in one and the same state @xmath12 from a set @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath59    in the case of @xmath60 cloning of equiprobable states without _ a priori _ information , the bound given by theorem 1 is reduced to the upper bound deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . if all the states of set @xmath61 are pure , that is @xmath62 for @xmath46 , and the ancilla contains no _ a priori _ information , that is @xmath63 , then we have @xmath64 in this special case the limit given by theorem 1 is reduced to the limit obtained in ref .",
    "thus , theorem 1 provides the extension of the preceding result in two significances . in the first place",
    ", it extends the known limit to the case of mixed states . in the second place",
    ", it takes into account that the ancilla state can contain _ a priori _ information about the state to be cloned .",
    "the limit by theorem 1 is a decreasing function of @xmath65 and increases as the _ a priori _ probabilities differ . for pure - state cloning",
    "this fact was shown in ref .",
    "so we are rather interested in dependence of the limit on the parameter @xmath66 .",
    "this parameter marks the top amount of the additional information , which can beforehand be contained in the ancilla .",
    "the more @xmath66 the less the given amount .",
    "let @xmath66 be variable between @xmath67 and 1 and let the rest of parameters be fixed",
    ". then we have @xmath68 in this range the limit by theorem 1 is an increasing function of @xmath69 . in line with eq .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) , the angle @xmath69 decreases as @xmath66 increases .",
    "therefore , the limit by theorem 1 decreases as @xmath66 increases .",
    "for @xmath70 the perfect cloning can be attained . in harmony with this ,",
    "the limit by theorem 1 is equal to 1 .",
    "for example , the equality @xmath71 is reached by the ancilla state @xmath72 , where @xmath46 . here the full information needed for the ideal cloning is already provided in the ancilla alone . on the contrary , in the standard cloning there is no _ a priori _ information , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath73 .",
    "then the limit by theorem 1 reaches its minimum as a function of @xmath66 . on the whole , these conclusions seem plausible and contribute to the stronger no - cloning theorem .    for @xmath74",

    "it is the probability of correctly distinguishing between two pure states @xmath79 and @xmath80 by optimal strategy .    in the case of pure states ,",
    "the limit by theorem 1 is least : the quantum network that attains this limit was presented in ref .",
    "so , it is natural to ask whether the transformation given in ref .",
    "@xcite reaches the limit in the case of mixed states ( and no _ a priori _ information in the ancilla ) . in general",
    ", the answer is negative",
    ". really , the transformation given in ref .",
    "@xcite has two significant features : ( 1 ) it acts on the hilbert space of system ab composed of registers a and b ; ( 2 ) the initial state of the extra register b is pure .",
    "but in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that these two features do not allow to reach always the limit in the special case of @xmath60 cloning of equiprobable mixed states .",
    "this example convinces that for optimization of mixed - state cloning the above features should not be presupposed .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 emphasizes the key importance of unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations and nondecrease of the fidelity function under the operation of partial trace .",
    "these general properties have allowed us to place the global - fidelity limit without detailing of cloning transformation .",
    "it is virtue of the proposed us approach .",
    "the weakness is that our approach does not minutely elucidate an attainability of the presented bound .",
    "just as the uncertainty relation succeeds the commutation relation and the quantum mechanical rule calculating the mean , the limit by theorem 1 succeeds the unitarity restriction and general properties of the fidelity .",
    "but accessibility of this limit in general case of mixed states is an open question . on the whole , for pure states",
    "we comprehend our abilities in the quantum information processing much better than for mixed states .",
    "we are now ready to state the global - fidelity limit when the state - set @xmath61 contains more states than two ( @xmath5 ) . to simplify the exposition",
    ", we assume that there is no _ a priori _ information about the state to be cloned . note that in this case we have @xmath81 as before",
    ", we take that _ a priori _ probabilities are arbitrary ; ones are constrained only by @xmath82 .    *",
    "theorem 2 * _ the global fidelity @xmath49 of standard @xmath4 cloning for set @xmath13 is limited above by value _",

    "can be rewritten as @xmath86 because @xmath87 , we can apply theorem 1 to each term of the sum of eq .",
    "( [ fid2 ] ) . by theorem 1 and eq .",
    "( [ restrict ] ) , @xmath88^{1/2}\\biggr\\ } \\!\\ . \\label{fid3}\\ ] ] eqs .",
    "( [ fid2 ] ) and ( [ fid3 ] ) provide the statement of theorem 2 .",
    "@xmath59    the bound established by theorem 2 is straightforward extension of limit given by theorem 1 .",
    "so this bound succeeds some features of the latter . for example , if two probabilities , say , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are variable and the rest of parameters is fixed , then the bound by theorem 2 is a decreasing function of @xmath65 and increases as these probabilities differ . if some one probability is close to 1 and other probabilities are small , then the bound is also close to 1 .",
    "this behavior is expected , because single known state can be cloned perfectly . for equal _ a priori _ probabilities , that is @xmath91 , the limit by theorem 2 becomes @xmath92 in the special case of pure states , eq .",
    "( [ fid4 ] ) gives the limit obtained in ref .",

    "now we shall address the following question .",
    "is the presented bound on the global fidelity always achievable ?",
    "in general , it is not the case . in order to reach the limit given by theorem 2 we must provide the equality in eq . ( [ fid3 ] ) for all pairs @xmath94 $ ] , where @xmath99 . as the arguments of appendix b show , the maximum of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fid3 ] ) (= the equality in eq .",
    "( [ fid3 ] ) ) holds only if @xmath100 so we have the system of @xmath101 equations of kind ( [ fid5 ] ) on the @xmath102 variables @xmath103 .",
    "except some special cases , this system is incompatible , because the number of equations is larger than the number of variables .",
    "thus , the presented limit is somewhat rough .",
    "more rigorous approach is to maximize the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fid1 ] ) in the domain of @xmath102-dimensional space that specified by the conditions @xmath104 and @xmath105 the conditions of kind ( [ fid6 ] ) arise from the unitarity restriction and general properties of the fidelity function .",
    "here we come across a typical problem of nonlinear programming ( the simple case @xmath106 of this problem is examined in appendix b ) . for prescribed values of parameters ,",
    "the desired maximum can be found by one of appropriate numerical methods . at the same time",
    ", it is difficult to obtain an exact formula for general case , mainly due to the complexity of domain boundary . but",
    "even if we should find it , we still would not have a complete solution to the problem of mixed - state cloning .",
    "in fact , it is not necessary that bound given by such a formula be least .",
    "so we have restricted our consideration to obtaining of the limit by theorem 2 .",
    "rough though this limit is , it has straightforward formation and allows to estimate how quantum laws constrain merit of state - dependent cloning .",
    "optimization of general unitary transformation is independent task that should be subjected in future investigations .",
    "evidently , it is harder than in the case of pure states .",
    "in present work we have obtained some new results on the limits of state - dependent cloning .",
    "this is obtained by use of the unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations and the general properties of the fidelity function .",
    "the achievement consists in that known bounds on the global fidelity of pure - state cloning are extended in two significances . in the first place , the mixed - state cloning is regarded . in the second place , we take into account that the ancilla state can contain _ a priori _ information about the state to be cloned .",
    "the dependence of limit on the parameter , that roughly describes the amount of _ a priori _ information , is considered .",
    "the conclusions made look reasonable and contribute to the stronger no - cloning theorem . in general , the presented bound can not always be attained .",

    "this approach may be used in numerical investigations .    replacing the squared modulus of the inner product by the fidelity function , the known global - fidelity limits of state - dependentm cloning of pure states are valid to mixed quantum states .",
    "this fact maintains an intuitive belief that use of mixed states hardly adds anything new to our possibilities in the quantum information processing .",
    "we study the mixed states rather because all the real devices are inevitably exposed to noise .",
    "so the pure states used us will eventually evolve to mixed states .",
