    "finding rigid submanifolds on a symplectic manifold has been one of fundamental questions in symplectic topology . among many notable symplectic manifolds ,",
    "symplectic toric manifolds have attracted special attention of symplectic topologists because they have provided interesting examples but are nonetheless accessible .",
    "the rigidity problem that we are concerned with is which lagrangian toric fibers are non - displaceable by a hamiltonian diffeomorphism on a compact symplectic toric manifold .",
    "there are several approaches to this problem .",
    "one approach taken by cho - oh @xcite , fukaya - oh - ohta - ono @xcite , @xcite and woodward @xcite for instance is searching which toric fibers have a non - trivial cohomology arising from certain lagrangian floer theories .",
    "another approach developed by entov - polterovich @xcite is using a quasi - state to show the existence of non - displaceable toric fibers . on the other hand , mcduff @xcite and abreu - borman - mcduff @xcite introduced the method of probes to find displaceable toric fibers .    in the firstly mentioned approach in @xcite , with the aid of toric structure , the potential function restricted to the 1-cochains of fibers , which is so called the landau - ginzburg superpotential in the physics literature , can be expressed as a laurent power series in terms of variables from a basis of the dual lattice . in general , it consists of two parts : the leading order potential function ( also called the hori - vafa potential ) written from the equations of the supporting hyperplanes of a moment polytope , and the correction terms coming from the contribution of holomorphic spheres .",
    "the potential function plays a crucial role in lagrangian floer theory on toric manifolds because the differential of the floer complex is determined by the partial derivatives of the potential function so that detecting a position with a non - vanishing floer cohomology is equivalent to finding a position admitting a critical point of the potential function .    in @xcite , a bulk deformation by components of the toric divisor was used to deform the potential function ( more essentially the underlying @xmath0-algebra ) , which allows us to conclude non - displaceability of toric fibers once the _ leading term equation _  , a part of the leading order potential function , has a solution on @xmath1 . moreover , using bulk - deformations with slightly extended coefficients , each coefficient in the leading term equation can be independently controlled , which allows us to have some flexibility when solving a system of equations .",
    "such a deformed leading term equation is called a _ generalized leading term equation _  . in this sense",
    ", our problem is reduced to solving a certain system of equations .",
    "a relevant discussion on solvability of a system of equations in tropical geometry can be found in the work of osserman - payne @xcite .",
    "it includes the intersection of _ tropicalizations _",
    "( definition  [ tropicalizationofequation ] ) lifts to a solution of the system over a valued field whenever they intersect _ properly _ ( see definition  [ intersectproperly ] ) , and it generalizes the lifting results of bogart - jensen - speyer - sturmfels - thomas @xcite dealing with the case where the tropicalizations intersect transversally .",
    "the result can be applied to some extent to detect non - displaceable toric fibers when tropicalizations intersect properly ( see corollary  [ tropicaliftingbalanced ] and example  [ onepointblowup1 ] ) .    in general",
    ", however , the intersection does not lift to a solution if the tropicalizations of a system intersect improperly .",
    "thus , in the improperly intersecting case , the toric fibers over the intersection are not necessarily non - displaceable .",
    "nevertheless , we might have hope that the intersection lifts to non - displaceable fibers because of the flexibility from bulk - deformations .",
    "as in figure  [ twopointblowupfig0 ] , the tropicalizations of the components of the gradient of the potential function in the two - point blowup of @xmath2 appeared in @xcite exactly intersect at the positions on which the fibers are non - displaceable even though the tropicalizations intersect improperly .",
