    "the absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics , and diffuse emission ( arcade ) is an instrument to measure the absolute temperature of the sky in search of distortions from a blackbody spectrum .",
    "arcade operates at centimeter wavelengths between full - sky surveys at radio frequencies below 3 ghz and the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) survey at frequencies above 60 ghz .",
    "it consists of a set of cryogenic radiometers observing at 37 km altitude from a balloon payload .",
    "each radiometer uses a double - nulled design , measuring the temperature difference between a corrugated horn antenna and an internal reference as the antenna alternately views the sky or a full - aperture blackbody calibrator .",
    "the internal reference can be adjusted to null the antenna - reference signal difference , while the calibrator temperature can be independently adjusted to null the sky - calibrator signal difference .",
    "arcade thus measures small shifts about a precise blackbody , greatly reducing dependence on instrument calibration and stability .",
    "the calibrator , antennas , internal reference , and radiometer front - end amplifiers are mounted within a large liquid helium dewar and are maintained near thermal equilibrium with the cmb .",
    "boiloff helium vapor , vented through the aperture , forms a barrier between the instrument and the atmosphere to allow operation in full cryogenic mode with no windows between the optics and the sky .",

    "electric dipole emission from a population of small , rapidly rotating dust grains will produce a spectrum with a broad peak in the frequency range 2040 ghz @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyze data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission and conclude that spinning dust accounts for the majority of emission in the galactic plane at 22 ghz .",
    "an alternative model explains the correlated emission as flat - spectrum synchrotron emission associated with star formation activity @xcite .",
    "energy losses as electrons propagate from their origin steepen the synchrotron index away from these sources . since a flat - spectrum component will increasingly dominate at higher frequencies , the spatial morphology of synchrotron emission at higher frequencies should increasingly resemble thermal dust emission from the same star formation activity .     , width=336 ]    efforts to distinguish between these models have largely focused on the frequency spectrum of the dust - correlated component inferred by correlating a map tracing thermal dust emission against microwave maps at different observing frequencies .",
    "the correlation with thermal dust emission is seen to peak at frequencies between 20 and 30 ghz , falling at frequencies below 22 ghz @xcite .",
    "this falling spectrum at low frequencies has been cited as evidence favoring spinning dust models .",
    "the decrease in dust - correlated emission at frequencies below 20 ghz , although consistent with spinning dust emission , does not necessarily support such models over the flat - spectrum synchrotron alternative .",
    "_ both _ models predict weaker correlation with thermal dust emission at frequencies below 20 ghz . for the spinning dust model , the weaker correlation results from the lower amplitude of the spinning dust emission .",
    "the flat - spectrum synchrotron model , however , also predicts a weaker correlation at lower frequencies , since by construction the spatial morphology of the sky in this model varies smoothly from the wmap data at 22 ghz ( observed to correlate well with the thermal dust morphology ) to the haslam map at 408 mhz ( observed to correlate only weakly with thermal dust emission ) .",
    "model discrimination based on cross - correlations with thermal dust emission must rely on rigorous statistical comparison of competing models , and not simply on the general trend toward weaker correlations at lower frequencies .",
    "a simpler test relies on the absolute spectrum of galactic emission . at frequencies below 30 ghz ,",
    "thermal dust emission is negligible , so that the total galactic emission becomes a superposition of free - free , synchrotron , and spinning dust emission .",
    "both free - free and synchrotron emission increase monotonically at lower frequencies .",
    "spinning dust , in contrast , _ decreases _ in amplitude below 20 ghz , so that the spectrum of the combined galactic emission below 20 ghz can be used to place limits on the contribution of spinning dust without reference to detailed spatial correlations with a thermal dust template .",
    "figure [ spin_model ] illustrates the concept .",
    "consider galactic emission consisting of a superposition of synchrotron and spinning dust ( ignoring for the moment the smaller contribution from free - free emission ) .",
    "following @xcite , we specify the spinning dust amplitude as a fraction of the total galactic brightness at 22 ghz , assumed here to represent the peak in the dust spectrum . as the dust normalization",
    "is increased , the synchrotron amplitude at 22 ghz must decrease to keep the total emission constant .",
    "the spinning dust spectrum falls rapidly , so that emission below 10 ghz is dominated by the synchrotron component . a model with high dust normalization ( red curves in fig .",
    "[ spin_model ] ) will thus have fainter synchrotron emission at frequencies of a few ghz , while a model with less spinning dust ( blue curves ) will have brighter synchrotron emission .",
    "this shift in the amplitude of galactic emission at frequencies below 10 ghz is a sensitive test for spinning dust , without resort to detailed spatial correlations .",
    "we implement this test using a simple model of galactic emission .",
    "we assume that the spatial distribution of spinning dust emission is traced by a template map of thermal dust emission , and fix the amplitude of associated spinning dust emission by scaling the template map so that the re - scaled dust map forms a specified fraction of the galactic plane intensity measured by the wmap 22 ghz map .",
    "this allows a simple normalization of spinning dust in terms of its relative contribution to the total galactic plane intensity at 22 ghz .",
    "we use the cobe / dirbe 240 @xmath27 m map of thermal dust emission @xcite as the thermal dust template since it is dominated by thermal dust emission but unaffected by extinction in the plane . for specificity",
    ", we define the galactic plane mask using all pixels lying within the arcade 2 observation pattern with latitude @xmath118 , and use this mask for all computations so that the model results are not affected by differing sky coverage between arcade 2 and other surveys .",
    "we then model the galactic emission spectrum as follows .",
    "we first correct the wmap 22 ghz map and the haslam 408 mhz map by subtracting the wmap maximum - entropy model of free - free emission @xcite using a spectral index @xmath13 .",
    "the corrected maps then contain only synchrotron and ( possibly ) spinning dust emission .",
    "we assume that the spinning dust spectrum peaks at 22 ghz and scale the normalized spinning dust map to lower frequencies using the @xcite model for the warm neutral medium .",
    "after correction for free - free and spinning dust emission , the 22 ghz and 408 mhz maps contain only synchrotron emission , which we use to define the synchrotron amplitude and spectral index for each pixel .",
    "the resulting model ( synchrotron , free - free , and spinning dust ) can be used to estimate the combined galactic emission at frequencies between 408 mhz and 22 ghz .",
    "we compare the model to the arcade 2 data by smoothing the model map of combined emission to the arcade 2 angular resolution , and then computing the mean galactic emission of the smoothed model for all pixels within the arcade 2 galactic plane mask .",
    "figure [ spinning_dust_test ] shows the result . if spinning dust is negligible , the synchrotron contribution at 22 ghz is maximal and the model approximates the flat - spectrum synchrotron model . as the spinning dust amplitude increases , the synchrotron contribution at 22 ghz decreases and the synchrotron spectral index steepens . the combination of lower synchrotron amplitude and falling dust spectrum combine to lower the total model emission across the arcade 2 frequency bands .",
    "the arcade 2 data lie below the model prediction for no spinning dust , and are consistent with spinning dust contributing @xmath5 of the total k - band galactic plane emission .",
    "wmap is a differential instrument and is insensitive to any monopole emission component .",
    "the zero level of the 22 ghz map is set using the cosecant dependence on galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "the 408 mhz survey and the arcade 2 data , however , both include monopole contributions . to prevent discrepant treatment of the map zero levels from affecting the model predictions , we remove a monopole from the 408 mhz survey and the arcade 2 sky maps , and re - set the zero level of each map using a @xmath2 fit to the spatial structure in each map to match the processing of the wmap data .",
    "we restrict analysis to pixels at low galactic latitude ( @xmath118 ) where galactic emission is brightest so that uncertainties in the zero level have minimal effect .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the analysis is the correction for free - free emission .",
    "we use the wmap maximum - entropy model of free - free emission , derived assuming that spinning dust contributes negligibly to the total galactic emission .",
    "we test the sensitivity of the result to the free - free normalization by repeating the analysis using the same maximum - entropy model scaled by a constant normalization factor . changing the free - free normalization by a factor of 2",
    "affects the best - fit spinning dust normalization by approximately 0.08 , and is included in the total quoted uncertainty .",
    "we use the arcade 2 absolutely calibrated observations of the sky  to model galactic emission at frequencies 3 , 8 , and 10 ghz and angular resolution 116 .",
    "tt plots of the binned sky maps show net spectral index @xmath19 between 3.3 and 8.3 ghz and @xmath20 between 3.3 and 10.3 ghz , consistent with a superposition of synchrotron and free - free emission .",
    "the spatial structure in the maps can be described using two spatial templates , the haslam 408 mhz survey to trace synchrotron emission and the cobe / firas map of cii emission to trace free - free emission .",
    "fitting these templates to the arcade 2 maps yields spectral index @xmath0 for emission traced by the synchrotron template , with free - free normalization @xmath41  evaluated for latitudes @xmath40  in the lowest arcade 2 channel at 3.15 ghz .",
    "the template model only specifies galactic emission up to an additive constant .",
    "we fully specify the galactic model by computing the temperature of the template model toward three reference locations ( north and south polar caps plus the coldest patch in the northern hemisphere ) , and adding a constant to the template model to match the galactic temperature derived by other means .",
    "one estimate of the galactic temperature models the galaxy as a simple plane - parallel structure and derives the polar cap temperatures from the slope of the galactic emission binned by the cosecant of galactic latitude .",
    "a second , independent method computes the correlation between radio emission and cii line emission , then estimates the radio brightness at each reference position by multiplying the cii intensity at that position by the measured radio / cii correlation slope .",
    "both methods yield similar estimates for the total galactic temperature towards each reference location .",
    "we extend the analysis to full - sky surveys at lower frequencies and find that galactic polar cap temperature from both methods is consistent with a single power law over the frequency range 22 mhz to 10 ghz , with spectral index @xmath4 and normalization @xmath119 k at reference frequency @xmath90 = 1 ghz .",
    "arcade2 produces well - calibrated maps of galactic emission .",
    "we use these maps to test for contributions from spinning dust near the galactic plane .",
    "previous tests for spinning dust at frequencies below 20 ghz have used only the spatial correlation with template maps tracing thermal dust emission .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dust - correlated component is not a stringent test for spinning dust , since a weaker correlation at lower frequencies is expected both for models with significant spinning dust contributions as well as models with flat - spectrum synchrotron but no spinning dust .",
    "we use a simple model of the total galactic emission to predict the mean intensity of the galactic plane in the region observed by arcade 2 .",
    "the model normalizes the spinning dust contribution at 22 ghz , and computes the expected total contribution from free - free , synchrotron , and spinning dust as a function of frequency and spinning dust normalization .",
    "the arcade 2 data consistently show less emission in the galactic plane than a model with no spinning dust , and are consistent with spinning dust contributing @xmath5 of the galactic plane emission at 22 ghz .",
