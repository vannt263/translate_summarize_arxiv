    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) is one of the most important open questions today in physics .",
    "there are strong observational evidences indicating that about @xmath9 of the universe is under the form of dm ( @xmath10 ) and de ( @xmath11 ) , but no direct detection has been reported until now .",
    "the usual candidates to dm ( e.g. neutralinos and axions ) and de ( e.g. cosmological constant , quintessence ) lead to very robust scenarios , but at same time they must face theoretical and observational issues . for recent reviews on the subject , see for example @xcite .    among the alternatives to the standard description of the dark sector",
    "there is the possibility of a modification of gravity theory on large scales , see @xcite for a recent review on the subject .",
    "an example are the so - called @xmath12 theories , which are based on the inclusion of non - linear curvature terms in the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "other possibilities are the unified dark matter models , where dm and de are treated as a single entity @xcite , models in which dm is treated as a viscous component @xcite and models of interaction in the dark sector ( i.e. exchange of energy between dm and de ) @xcite .",
    "another example , the one we pursue in this paper , is to touch one of the cornerstone of the gravity theory : the usual conservation laws for matter components .",
    "this kind of formulation was introduced by rastall some 40 years ago @xcite , and has been recently investigated in a cosmological context , giving some interesting results concerning the dynamics of the dark sector @xcite .    rastall s motivation for modifying the usual conservation laws is based on the fact that the latter have been directly tested only locally or in a weak - field regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the introduction of covariant derivatives imply , in some sense , an exchange of energy between matter and the gravitational field .",
    "hence , in general , non - trivial generalizations of the conservation law are in principle possible .",
    "besides , particle production in curved spacetimes is a central issue of quantum field theory on such spaces @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may regard modifications of the usual ( classical ) conservation laws as effective , semi - classical approaches to such phenomenon .",
    "rastall s proposal is the following : @xmath13 where the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative and @xmath14 is a ( dimension - full ) free parameter .",
    "the above relation can be rewritten as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor and @xmath0 is now a dimensionless free parameter .",
    "when @xmath17 , then @xmath1 and the usual conservation law ( and thus general relativity ) is recovered .    in a one - fluid model , it is possible to redefine the energy - momentum tensor in order to recover the usual conservation law @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "rastall s theory is just a redefinition of the fluid equation of state .",
    "however , in a multi - fluid case the modification introduced by rastall opens possibilities of non - trivial interactions among the different components . in @xcite ,",
    "this feature is used to investigate the consequences of the modified conservation law for a model of the dark sector of the universe : the authors investigate a two - fluid model , one of them being pressureless matter @xmath18 , whereas the other obeying the vacuum energy equation of state @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that the matter component obeys the usual conservation law , then the vacuum energy conservation law is affected by the presence of matter , via eq .  .",
    "the main result of @xcite indicates that the model is completely equivalent to the @xmath20cdm at the background and linear perturbations levels .",
    "there is just one striking difference : de may now agglomerate .",
    "this fact could have important consequences at the non - linear level , which is a regime where the @xmath20cdm faces some difficulties @xcite .",
    "in the model studied in @xcite , the equivalence with the @xmath20cdm at background and linear perturbations levels implies that no constraints on the parameter @xmath0 can be established using the corresponding observational tests .",
    "such constraints are , on the other hand , in principle possible using non - linear data . in the present paper",
    "our goal is to verify to what extent the model studied in reference @xcite is a favorable configuration . to do this",
    ", we repeat the analysis made there but with the @xmath21 component now being described by a more general equation state , i.e. @xmath22 , with @xmath4 constant .",
    "we show that in this case the parameter @xmath0 appears explicitly in the background and linear perturbation equations .",
    "therefore , using type ia supernovae data , we calculate its probability distribution function ( pdf ) along with the one for the matter density parameter @xmath23 , and for the equation of state parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis show that supernovae date do not constrain strictly @xmath0 whereas @xmath24 is favored .",
    "then , considering the evolution of small perturbations we find a dramatic instability if @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this is a result which favors general relativity , i.e. @xmath1 . on the other hand , another possibility seems to be viable , i.e. @xmath8 , for which the dynamical equations turn independent of @xmath0 and which is the case investigated in @xcite , which thus seems to be favored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rastthe ] we present rastall s theory , deriving some cosmological considerations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obsconstr ] we confront the predictions of rastall s theory with data from the type ia supernovae of the constitution set . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pertan ] we tackle the question of the evolution of small perturbations and , finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : resdisc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "according to eq .  , einstein equations must be modified as follows : @xmath25 in order to be compatible with bianchi identities ( we use @xmath26 units hereafter ) .",
    "we consider a two - fluid model .",
    "the first component mimics baryons and dm , i.e. has negligible effective pressure , whereas the second describes an exotic dark component responsible for the acceleration of the universe , and has an equation of state of the form @xmath3 , with @xmath4 constant .",
    "we assume the matter component to conserve as usual .",
    "this is important in order to have matter agglomeration required to form the local structures .",
    "the field equations become @xmath27\\;,\\\\ \\label{n } t^{\\mu\\nu}_{x}{}_{;\\mu } & = & \\left(\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\right)\\left(t^{;\\nu}_{x } +   t^{;\\nu}_{m}\\right)\\ ; , \\qquad t^{\\mu\\nu}_{m}{}_{;\\mu } = 0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscripts or superscripts @xmath21 and @xmath28 denote the de and the matter component , respectively . on large scales",
    "we assume the universe to be described by the spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) line element , @xmath29\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the scale factor .",
    "the perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor has the following form : @xmath31 then , the field equations take on the following form : @xmath32 + ( 3-\\gamma)\\rho_{m}\\right\\}\\ ; , \\label{1420}\\\\ \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a } & = & \\frac{4\\pi g}{3}\\left\\{\\left[3(\\gamma-2)w_{x } -\\gamma\\right]\\rho_{x }   - \\gamma\\rho_{m}\\right\\}\\;,\\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_{x } + 3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}(1 + w_{x})\\rho_{x } & = & \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\left[(1 - 3w_{x})\\dot{\\rho}_{x }   + \\dot{\\rho}_{m}\\right]\\ ; , \\label{1419}\\\\ \\label{rhomeq}\\dot{\\rho}_{m } + 3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rho_{m } & = & 0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath33 .",
    "note how the expansion history of the universe depends of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is not difficult to show that , if @xmath8 , then neither @xmath34 nor @xmath35 depend on @xmath0 .",
    "this is the case investigated in @xcite , where the model has a background expansion identical to the @xmath20cdm one .",
    "the evolution of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of the scale factor are easily determined by solving eqs .   and , which yields to : @xmath38 from eq .",
    "one can infer a constraint on @xmath0 by requiring @xmath37 to be positive . to be conservative , we require the second term , which acts as a contribution to matter , to be positive and then one can find that , assuming @xmath39 , @xmath40 the right limit is not included because it makes the denominator vanishing . for @xmath8 , , i.e. the case investigated in @xcite , one obtains @xmath41 . the first term in eq .",
    "has an exponent which , in principle , could also be positive , mimicking thus a phantom component .",
    "if we want to avoid this to occur , we can find more constraints .",
    "we still assume @xmath4 to be negative , but now we have to distinguish between the two cases @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( the case @xmath8 `` kills '' the exponent ) .",
    "thus , the exponent of the first term in eq .",
    "is negative for : @xmath44 the first constraint is contained in eq .",
    ", which is more restrictive .",
    "the second one combined with eq .",
    "gives : @xmath45 thus , we come to an interesting result : in rastall theory it is possible to have de with an equation of state @xmath46 , without necessarily it being phantom .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 has to be chosen according the above constraint and the value @xmath1 is evidently not included .",
    "it is also important to stress that , when @xmath47 then the exponent is larger than @xmath48 and therefore it is sub - dominant in the past with respect to the matter contribution .",
    "note that the exotic fluid density can be split into two fluids , one of which behaves as matter .",
    "moreover , we have denoted as @xmath49 the present value ( i.e. for @xmath50 ) of the matter density , and as @xmath51 the present value of that part of the @xmath21-fluid which behaves as de , being the total density of the @xmath21-fluid today @xmath52 the present - time density parameters of the de and of matter are given by @xmath53 and in a flat universe are related as follows , by using friedmann equation  : @xmath54\\;. \\label{36}\\ ] ] in the case @xmath1 , the above relation recovers the corresponding general relativity one : @xmath55 .",
    "we consider type ia supernova data ( the constitution set @xcite , which uses the salt filter ) and perform a bayesian analysis . in more detail , we calculate first the @xmath56 function , defined as follows : @xmath57   ^2}{\\sigma_i^2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the total number of observational data @xmath59 with uncertainty @xmath60 and @xmath61 are their theoretical predictions , which depend on a set @xmath62 of parameters . assuming the data to be independent gaussian random variables , see for example @xcite , and flat priors on the parameters , the posterior probability function is constructed from the @xmath56 function as follows @xmath63 for our model , we have four free parameters : @xmath64 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath64 can be handled in a special way and it can be excluded , leaving just three free parameters .",
    "type ia supernovae data consist in the distance modulus @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the apparent magnitude , @xmath68 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath69 is the luminosity distance @xmath70 the distance modulus can also be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the hubble - free luminosity distance and @xmath73 is the zero point offset , defined by @xmath74 for the rastall s model considered here , the hubble parameter is given by @xmath75 + \\frac{(3 - \\gamma)}{2}\\omega_m(z)\\biggl\\}^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath23 satisfying the condition ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "we employ data from the so - called constitution set @xcite , which includes 397 distance moduli , out of which 100 come from the new low - z cfa3 sample and the rest from the union set .",
    "both samples have a redshift range of @xmath78 .",
    "the main improvement of the constitution sample is the inclusion of a larger number of nearby @xmath79 supernovae , thus reducing the statistical uncertainty .",

    "the strong constraints found in the perturbative analysis performed in the present paper is to describe the dark energy component through a self - interacting scalar field .",
