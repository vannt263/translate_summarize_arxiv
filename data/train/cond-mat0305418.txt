    "among metal - hydrides@xcite the magnesium hydrogen system has always occupied a special place .",
    "magnesium reacts reversibly with hydrogen to form mgh@xmath1 .",
    "it is thus considered to be one of the most important candidates for the reversible storage of hydrogen@xcite due to its lightweight , low cost and high hydrogen storage capacity ( 7.6 wt.% of hydrogen ) . in spite of the large number of publications on mg - mgh@xmath1 only little",
    "is known about the intrinsic physical properties of this system .",
    "the scarcity of data for mgh@xmath3 is mainly due to the experimental difficulties encountered when trying to hydride mg.@xcite nowadays , a great effort is made to improve the hydrogen ab / desorption kinetics by making nanocrystalline mg@xcite and/or adding e.g. transition metals@xcite by ball milling .",
    "recent theoretical calculations@xcite reproduce that mgh@xmath1 undergoes various phase transitions @xcite as a function of pressure .",
    "all theoretical calculations published so far@xcite ( using either the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ) predict band gaps between 3.1 and 4.2  ev for @xmath0-mgh@xmath1 . this is smaller than the few sporadic experimental values reported until now .",
    "krasko@xcite mentions a value of 5.16  ev for the band gap from unpublished work by genossar .",
    "he and pong@xcite determined in an indirect way using penn s formula@xcite an average band gap of 5.8  ev .",
    "et al._@xcite report an optical transmission spectrum for a thin film in which the transmission vanishes at 6.05  ev ( 205  nm ) .",
    "apart from that ellinger _",
    "et al._@xcite found an index of refraction of 1.95 and 1.96 for the ordinary and extraordinary rays at 589.3  nm .",
    "the dielectric properties have not been studied at all .",
    "this triggered our interest to study the optical properties of mgh@xmath1 in detail .",
    "another strong reason for our interest in mgh@xmath1 stems from metal - hydride switchable mirrors . in 1996",
    "hui - berts _ et al._@xcite discovered that y and la thin films change reversibly from shiny , metallic films to transparent , insulating films upon hydrogenation either by changing the surrounding hydrogen gas pressure or the electrolytic cell potential.@xcite in 1997 van  der  sluis _ et al._@xcite discovered that all rare - earth ( re ) metals exhibit such a switchable behaviour .",
    "however , all these materials have a characteristic colour in the fully hydrogenated state because their band gap is in the visible ( @xmath4  ev ) .",
    "they showed that alloying with mg results in colour neutral switchable mirrors .",
    "this is very important for applications in e.g.`smart ' windows . in 2001",
    "et al._@xcite reported that mg@xmath5ni ( @xmath6 ) also features reversible switching behaviour upon hydrogenation .",
    "in all these cases ( re - mg and mg@xmath5ni ) , the band gap is shifted to higher energies with increasing magnesium concentration.@xcite all these alloys disproportionate upon hydrogenation.@xcite this disproportionation is also known for bulk re - mg.@xcite the available data suggest that the shift of the band gap to higher energies is due to the formation of mgh@xmath1 which is expected to have a large band gap . at the same time",
    "the reflectance in the low hydrogen phase ( when the sample is unloaded ) increases due to mg which has a high reflection.@xcite at intermediate concentrations the coexistence of mg and mgh@xmath1 seems to play an important role in the realization of a highly absorbing , black state that is observed during loading and unloading of re - mg alloys.@xcite it may also play a role in the black state observed in mg@xmath5nih@xmath3.@xcite thus , to understand the role of mgh@xmath1 in mg - containing switchable mirrors it is essential to determine the optical properties of mgh@xmath1 thin films .    in this paper",
    "we study thin films of magnesium hydride with spectrophotometry and ellipsometry and determine the dielectric function and the optical band gap . for this purpose",
    "we use a special substrate geometry and a novel type of optical gas loading cell .",
    "mgh@xmath1 thin films are made in two steps .",
    "first pd capped metallic mg films are deposited under uhv conditions on an appropriate substrate . the pd cap layer is necessary to protect mg against oxidation and to promote hydrogen dissociation and absorption .",
    "the films are subsequently loaded with hydrogen under high pressure up to the composition mgh@xmath1 .",
    "the hydrogenation of mg to mgh@xmath1 is , however , not straightforward as was shown by krozer , kasemo and others.@xcite palladium capped mg films exhibit unusual kinetics due to the formation of a blocking mgh@xmath1 layer at the interface between pd and mg .",
    "the mgh@xmath1 layer prevents h to diffuse@xcite to the metallic mg that is still present underneath .",
    "the formation of this blocking layer can be circumvented by starting hydrogenation at relatively low ( 1  mbar ) h@xmath1 pressure at a temperature of 100@xmath7c .",
    "magnesium films with thicknesses up to 150  nm can be fully transformed to mgh@xmath1 in this way.@xcite      thin , polycrystalline films of mg and pd are deposited at room temperature in an uhv mbe system with a background pressure of 10@xmath8 mbar , using material of typically 99.9  % purity .",
    "the magnesium films are evaporated from a knudsen cell and covered with a 10  nm thick pd cap layer .",
    "these palladium films are deposited from an e - beam evaporation unit .",
    "typically , we deposit films simultaneously on a 10x10  mm@xmath9 glassy carbon substrate for rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) , 10x10  mm@xmath9 quartz substrates for x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , resistivity and/or afm measurements , and on a quartz substrate (   42  mm , heraeus suprasil 1 ) for optical measurements .",
    "rbs is used to determine eventual contamination of the films . for this glassy carbon substrates",
    "are used in order to separate the mg signal from the background signal of the substrate . an oxygen contamination between @xmath10/[\\mbox{mg } ] \\leq 0.085 $ ] has been found .",
    "the thickness of the film is measured with a dektac@xmath11 or a tencor alpha step 200 mechanical stylus profilometer .",
    "the surface structure , both before and after hydrogen loading , is investigated with a nanoscope iii atomic force microscope ( afm ) , operating in tapping mode using silicon cantilevers .",
    "the scanned areas are typically 1x1 and 5x5  @xmath12m@xmath9 from which the root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness is determined .",
    "the thickness and roughness values from these techniques are used as input parameters in the modeling of the transmission , reflection and ellipsometric data ( see sec .",

    "are carried out in a perkin elmer lambda 900 spectrophotometer in the range @xmath14  ev ( @xmath15  nm ) .",
    "the specular and total transmission is recorded while the spectrophotometer is purged with argon or nitrogen in order to reduce absorption by o@xmath1 in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , and h@xmath1o in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the quartz substrates ( without film ) and pd samples are measured in reflection geometry from the top side ( i.e.  the metallic side ) at near normal incidence ( 8@xmath7 ) in an absolute reflection unit ( using a so - called vn geometry ) .",
    "ellipsometry measurements ( at rt ) in the energy range 1.0 to 6.5  ev ( @xmath16  nm ) are carried out in a rotating analyzer variable - angle spectroscopic ellipsometer ( vase , j.a .",
    "woollam co. inc . ) , using the wvase32 software program for data acquisition and analysis .",

    "standard deviation and ellipsometric data ( @xmath23 ) are recorded at each data point as an average of at least 100 revolutions , and up to 4000 revolutions of the analyzer for the most critical data .",
    "as the pd cap layer on top of the very transparent mgh@xmath1 layer is strongly absorbing , ellipsometry can not be carried out from the pd - side . thus , ellipsometry measurements need to be performed from the ` backside ' , through the substrate .",
    "flat substrates would need to be so thick that reflections from the front and backside of the substrate can be well separated . with a 2  mm diameter of the light beam",
    "the substrate must be thicker than 3 mm .",
    "however , at large angles of incidence the intensity loss in the light beam is substantial due to reflections at the air / substrate interface .",
    "furthermore , at energies close to the limit of the ellipsometer ( 6 - 6.5  ev ) , the intensity of the light beam is diminishing quickly .",

    "they are all covered with a 12  nm thick pd cap layer.,height=340 ]    for the normal incident approximation to be valid , the diameter of the semi - cylindrical substrate must be large compared to the size of the light beam ( 2  mm ) . for practical reasons we choose a semi - cylindrical substrate with a diameter of 42  mm .",
    "the top part of the semi - cylindrical substrate is cut away parallel to the base surface to enable transmission measurements .",
    "this design allows the angle of the incident light onto the sample to vary between 55@xmath7 and 75@xmath7 from the normal .",
    "both the flat and the semi - cylindrical substrates are made of quartz glass ( heraeus suprasil 1 ) . this material is transparent deep into the uv beyond the limit of our ellipsometer and spectrophotometer .    on the top of the large flat face",
    "we deposit , under exactly the same condition , three films with different mg thicknesses ( see fig .  [",

    "this method makes the determination of the dielectric function from ellipsometric data more reliable.@xcite      in order to measure the optical properties of mgh@xmath1 and pdh@xmath3 _ in situ _ in equilibrium with hydrogen at various pressures , we designed an experimental setup consisting of three parts : i ) a substrate / window ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : highpres],height=377 ]    this chamber is made of stainless steel and proof - pressurized to 200  bar .",
    "the design is such that the pressure in the high pressure chamber is everywhere the same , and it is not necessary to expose the sample to the ambient after loading at 100  bar h@xmath1 .",

    "the total chamber can be resistively heated up to 100@xmath7c .",
    "since mg is a metal and mgh@xmath1 an insulator , the time evolution of hydrogenation can be followed _ in situ _ in real time by monitoring the change of the resisitivity.@xcite this allows us to optimize the hydrogen pressure ( starting at low pressures and increasing it stepwise to 100  bar h@xmath1 ) in such a way that no impenetrable mgh@xmath1 layer is formed at the interface between pd and mg . for practical reasons",
    "we have mounted an extra sample in the high pressure loading chamber for resistivity measurements .",

    "since mgh@xmath1 is an insulator one would at first sight expect a much higher value .",

    "the same is true for the alkali halides.@xcite mgh@xmath1 and cah@xmath1 seem to be very similar . both materials are wide band gap insulators and have a valence band that is predominantly determined by hydrogen orbitals.@xcite for mgo and mgs both valence and conduction bands are determined by the anions ( o or s)@xcite as well and again the same holds for the alkali halides.@xcite    since both the valence and conduction band of mgh@xmath1 are formed by h states , the band gap of the alkaline - earth hydrides is expected to be almost independent of the metal as is the case for the alkali halides.@xcite the remaining dependence results from the influence of the metal - ion on the lattice parameter , and the influence of hybridization of the conduction band states with metal - ion @xmath19- and @xmath36-states . from xps experiments by franzen _",
    "et al._@xcite it seems that the onset of transitions in the valence band regions start for cah@xmath1 , srh@xmath1 and bah@xmath1 all at about 2.5  ev . since charging effects are taking into account , this gives a gap of about 5  ev quite close to what we have found for @xmath0-mgh@xmath1 .",
    "it is striking that lih and lid also have a gap of 5.0  ev .",
    "in this study we use a novel experimental setup for optical transmission and ellipsometry measurements .",
    "this setup facilitates greatly measurements of the optical properties and dielectric function of metal hydrides in a hydrogen environment .",
    "it is possible to control the gas pressure from 1  mbar to 100 bar , and thus the composition of metal hydrides over a wide range . the temperature , pressure and resistivity are monitored _ in situ _ during hydrogenation of a sample .",
    "we determine the dielectric properties of @xmath0-mgh@xmath1 and pdh@xmath3 and find that mgh@xmath1 is a transparent , colour neutral insulator with a band gap of @xmath2  ev .",
    "the transparency over the whole visible spectrum is @xmath2680% ( for a 100  nm thick film ) .",
    "the experimentally determined dielectric function in the photon energy range between 1 and 6.5  ev of @xmath0-mgh@xmath1 is in very good agreement with very recent calculations using the gw approximation .",
    "if we assume that calculations of the band gap for @xmath72- and @xmath73-mgh@xmath1 underestimate the experimental gap by the same amount as in @xmath0-mgh@xmath1 we expect an experimental gap of 5.7  ev for @xmath72-mgh@xmath1 and 3.75  ev for @xmath73-mgh@xmath1 .    in a coming publication we shall show that the dielectric function of mgh@xmath1 determined here can be used to explain the large optical absorption ( the so - called ` black state ' ) of mg - based alloys where metallic mg and insulating mgh@xmath1 nanodomains coexist .",
