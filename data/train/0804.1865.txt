    "in the last few years it has been proposed to exploit quantum effects to provide resolution enhancement in imaging procedures . among the numerous problems that are currently studied under the general name of _ quantum imaging _ , the investigations concerning the quantum limits on optical resolution have a special importance , as they may lead to new concepts in microscopy and optical data storage .",

    "this feature leads to a sub - rayleigh resolution scaling as @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the wavelength of the field @xcite .",
    "the theorethical and experimental study of photonic noon states @xcite has lead to the experimental a posteriori generation of two , three and four photons states @xcite and to the conditional generation of a state with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , very recently schemes for the generation of path - entangled noon states with high value of fidelity and arbitrary n have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however , the weak value of the generated number of photons strongly limits the potential applications to quantum lithography and quantum metrology .",
    "furthermore a noon state , as any superposition of macroscopic states ,  is `` supersensitive '' to losses .",
    "hence for a n - photon state a fractional loss @xmath10  would destroy the quantum effect responsible for the phase resolution improvement . a natural approach to increase the number of photons and",
    "to minimize the effect of losses is to exploit the process of stimulated emission .",
    "this process , also known as quantum injected optical parametric amplification , has been first studied in @xcite , and has found some important applications in the context of quantum information @xcite .",
    "recently the output radiation of an unseeded optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) has been exploited to show the typical @xmath11 feature @xcite fig.[fig : confronto]-(a ) . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the task of the amplification of photonic noon states by two different devices , both based on a quantum injected optical parametric amplifier ( qiopa ) .",

    "we then show that this device can not be successfully used to amplify a generic n - photon state since the typical @xmath12 feature of the seed is lost .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : non_coll ] , we propose to exploit a non - collinear qiopa in order to amplify a generic state maintaining the interference pattern of the seed , showing that significant value of the visibilities can be achieved by investigating high - order correlation functions .",
    "finally , the effects of losses are investigated , demonstrating that the amplified field exhibits a higher resilience to losses with respect to a pure noon state .",
