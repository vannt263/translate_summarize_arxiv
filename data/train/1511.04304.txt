    "the recent report of high - temperature superconductivity with @xmath5 k in compressed sulphur hydride opens new exciting perspectives in condensed matter and in the wider field of physics .",
    "@xcite the practical applications of this superconducting state is however hampered by the need of extremely high pressures @xmath6 . within this context",
    "a microscopic understanding of the underlying electronic states responsible for the pairing , and of many - body interaction mechanisms is thus fundamental to master the origin and properties of such extremely high critical temperature , with the perspective to predict new materials or suitable conditions where high-@xmath7 superconductivity can be achieved at room pressure.@xcite    most of the theoretical work in compressed sulphur hydrides have been carried out so far by means of first - principle calculations , providing useful insights.@xcite for instance , the most stable compound in the range of pressure relevant for superconductivity ( @xmath8 gpa ) has been predicted to be h@xmath0s with _",

    "raman spectra for instance are extremely broad and not conclusive,@xcite as likely results of the large atomic zero point motion .",
    "the relevance of such quantum fluctuations has been also pointed out in refs . .",
    "furthermore , the superconducting critical temperature has been shown to depend crucially on the annealing processes and on the pressure / cooling procedures.@xcite these observations suggest that lattice fluctuations and local effects due to interfaces , defects and impurities , and to the coexistence of different metastable phases,@xcite can possibly affect and control the superconducting properties . addressing these issues in first - principle approaches is however a hard task , because of the need of a large supercell .",
    "a reliable tight - binding model is thus highly desired , with the aim to address all these issues with a affordable computational cost , and to provide an analytical description of the elementary excitations and of their coupling with the vibrational degrees of freedom , which can be easily extended at the local level .",
    "in this work , using ab - initio calculations as a reference , we present a suitable slater - koster tight - binding model , providing an accurate analytical description of the electronic band structure .",
    "we show that the van hove singularities can be properly reproduced by taking into account the role of the hopping between nearest neighbor @xmath3 and @xmath4 sulphur orbitals .",
    "the description of the tight - binding model in terms of a slater - koster approach ,  @xcite in addition , allows for an analytical description of the electron - phonon coupling at the local as well as a uniform level .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon coupling is thus related to the dependence of the slater - koster hopping parameters on the interatomic distance .",
    "the hopping - resolved electron - phonon coupling is hence numerically computed by using first - principle calculations .",

    ", we include thus , using a slater - koster framework , the nearest neighbor hybridization between _ all _ the orbitals of the hilbert space .",

    "additional parameters of the tight - binding model are the on - site orbital energies @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , corresponding to the h @xmath29 , s @xmath30 , s @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix assumes thus the relatively simple form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 and where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",

    "the matrix structure of such hamiltonian is simple enough to allow for an analytical solution in all the high - symmetry points @xmath20 , h , n , p , of the brillouin zone .",
    "a detailed analysis of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in these high - symmetry points is provided in appendix [ a : eigen ] . a careful inspection of the orbital character permits also to identify qualitatively each eigenstate of the tb hamiltonian with a corresponding level in the dft band structure .",
    "it is clear that , given the limited number ( ten ) of adjustable tight - binding parameters , it is not possible to match the energy of each dft level with a corresponding tight - binding eigenvalues on all the high - symmetry points .",
    "moreover , a careful inspection reveals that the parameter @xmath46 , as well as the combination @xmath64 , _ never _ appear at the high - symmetry points @xmath20 , h , n , p.@xcite however , as we show below , the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath64 play a pivot role in the realistic band structures , being responsible for the non - monotonic dispersion of the conduction band along the cut h - n , whose maximum is associated with the most relevant van hove singularity close to the fermi level .    in this regards , we can explicitly compare the analytical properties of our tight - binding model with the ones presented in refs . .",
    "in particular , we notice that the model of ref . can be obtained by considering only the hopping terms @xmath39 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . on the other hand , the minimal model of ref .",
    "corresponds to consider the nearest neighbor hoppings @xmath44 , @xmath39 , the linear combination @xmath65 , plus few farther neighbor hoppings . in both the cases , the hoppings @xmath46 and @xmath64 were not included .",

    "provide us a suitable tool to describe in an accurate way the band structure of h@xmath0s . to this aim , guided by dft calculations ,",
    "the ten tight - binding parameters must be specified . a widely used procedure , employed in refs . , is to evaluate the hybridization constants between atomic orbitals on different locations by means of a wannier representation .",
    "this method , however , as mentioned in ref . , is not straightforwardly cast in terms of a slater - koster description . in order to show the feasibility of our tight - binding model in giving a satisfactory description of the band structure , we use thus a more analytical approach to estimate the ten slater - koster parameters , keeping in mind that a better set of parameters can be achieved by more refined methods .",
    "we first note that , as mentioned above , the simple form of the hamiltonian matrix allows for an analytical solution of the eigenvalues on all the high - symmetry points @xmath20 , h , n , p. in principle , the identification of appropriate ten eigenvalues on these high - symmetry points with the corresponding dft energy levels can provide a way to determine in an unambiguous way all the ten tight - binding parameters . however , as remarked in the previous section , one can notice that the parameter @xmath46 and the combination @xmath58 , do not appear at the high - symmetry points @xmath20 , h , n , p. further insight can be thus achieved by considering also the point f , midway between p and h. although with relative less symmetry , the analysis of the eigenvalues in this point is useful because , as shown in appendix [ a : eigen ] , they depend in a independent way of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , allowing thus to evaluate them independently .",
    "a further natural way to estimate @xmath46 , away from the high - symmetry points , is to associate it with the properties of the van hove singularities .",
    "more precisely , we determine @xmath46 by fixing that the energy of the upper van hove singularity to be the same in the tight - binding model as in first - principle calculations .",
    "details of the procedure are reported in appendix [ a : param ] .",

    "[ cols=\"^ , > \" , ]     it is worth to remark that the absolute value of almost all the hopping parameters , @xmath66 , results to decrease with increasing the interatomic distance , apart from the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ruling the interatomic hopping between s 3@xmath4 orbitals , which appear to _ increase _ for larger interatomic distance .",
    "this result is at apparent odds with the simple slater - koster picture relating the interatomic hopping with two - center orbital integrals .",
    "however it should be kept in mind that , in the mapping with a dft calculation , the extracted slater - koster parameters represent _ effective _ quantities that take into account many - body physics . in this respect , a simple explanation for this unconventional behavior could be that it results from a _ reduction _ of the underlying microscopic two - center orbital integrals compensated , and even overwhelmed , for the 3@xmath4 - 3@xmath4 hopping , by a _ reduction _ of the screening effects .",
    "more specific analysis is however needed to investigate in more details , and possibly confirm , this hypothesis .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we have introduced a accurate tight - binding model , based on the slater - koster formalism , for the electronic band dispersion of h@xmath0 at high - pressure in the _ im_@xmath1_m _ structure .",
    "the tight - binding parameters have been numerically evaluated by means of a direct comparison with first - principle calculations .",
    "we show that the inter - atomic hopping between the 3@xmath3 and 3@xmath4 orbitals of sulphur plays a crucial role in determining the existence and energies of the van hove singularities that hive rise to the peak of density of states at the fermi level .",
    "our tight - binding model provides not only an accurate description of the band - structure in the whole brillouin zone , but also an exceptionally good description of the relevant fermi surface .",
    "the model here presented provides thus a fundamental base for the future inclusion of many - body ( electron - electron , electron - phonon ) effects .",
    "in addition , by computing the effective dependence of the tight - binding parameters on the interatomic distance , we have also numerically estimated a hopping - resolved linear electron - lattice coupling , which can be used for further refinements of the electronic properties in the presence of lattice disorder .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of such inter - atomic electron - lattice couplings permits in principle to obtain an estimate of the electron - phonon coupling also in the homogeneous case .",
    "such modelling , although can not replace accurate dft calculations on a quantitative level , can be nevertheless useful in providing a suitable tool for understanding in a semi - analytical way the role of each microscopical orbital hybridization ( e.g. in the pressure dependence of @xmath67 in the high-@xmath6 regime ) and for making qualitative predictions in more complex and realistic conditions , e.g. in the presence of disorder etc ... such computational analyses are however out of the purposes of the present paper , and they will be addressed in a further work .",

    "this is due to the fact that the parameter @xmath46 does not appear in the determination of the tight - binding energy levels at any high - symmetry point . in similar way , excluding the levels @xmath191 , @xmath192 , also the linear combination @xmath58 never appears among the eigenvalues of the tight - binding model on any high - symmetry points @xmath20-h - n - p .",
    "a step forwards in determine these parameters comes from considering also the lower - symmetry point f@xmath146 . as shown in section [ appf][eqs .",
    "( [ hsmatrf22])-([eq.72 ] ) ] , this results to be very profitable because on this point the slater - koster parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 appear in an independent way in different eigenvalues .",
    "quite useful appears in particular the level @xmath195 , whose energy is ruled by only @xmath43 ( and not by @xmath42 ) , and which , after an identification with the dft energy levels by means of the orbital character ( see table [ t - dft ] ) , results to be at @xmath196 ev , relatively close to the fermi level . including this level among the analytical constraints , we can therefore estimate , from the dft calculations on the @xmath20 , h , n , p , f points , all the slater - koster tight - binding parameters but @xmath46 .",
    "motivated by the relevance of the van hove singularity on the electronic properties at the fermi level , we choose to fix this last parameter such to reproduce the energy of upper vhs , close to the fermi level .",
    "as discussed in the main text , the saddle point associated with such vhs is visible as a local maximum in the band dispersion along the cut h - n .",
    "the energy of such thus singularity in the our dft calculations is @xmath197 ev , in agreement with other dft calculations based on the same code.@xcite we thus fix the value of the parameter @xmath46 by requiring the tight - binding band - structure to have a similar van hove singularity at the _ same _ energy , i.e. @xmath198 ev . all the tight - binding parameters , estimated in this way , are reported in table [ t - tbparam ] , and the comparison between the dft and tb band structures and density of states is shown in fig .",

    "note that no direct information about the fermi level was employed to estimate the tight - binding parameters . in this perspective , the agreement between the tb and dft fermi surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ f - bands]c , d ) is particularly significant and it points out the robustness of the present tight - binding model .",
    "it is also worth to stress here that the direct hopping between s @xmath30 and s @xmath31 orbitals on nearest neighbor sulphur atoms , governed by the parameter @xmath46 , is fundamental in order to reproduce the correct low - energy properties ( and hence the fermi properties ) of the band structure .",

    ", the resulting tb dispersion still reproduces the chosen dft energy levels on the high - symmetry points , but the overall band structure is nevertheless quite different . more striking is the lack of the saddle point ( and van hove singularity ) along the cut h - n , and as a consequence the low - energy properties and the fermi surface ( fig .",
    "[ f - bandapp]e , f ) appear radically different .",
    "the lack of the vhs close to the fermi level also implies of course the lack of a peak at the fermi level in the density of states ( fig .",
