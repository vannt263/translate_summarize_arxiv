    "the nature of the coupling between inflow and outflow in accreting compact objects has been the focus of intensive study in recent years .",
    "galactic x - ray binary sources provide ideal laboratories in which to probe this disc - jet coupling , since they pass through a number of well - defined accretion regimes as they evolve through their full duty cycles on timescales of months to years .",
    "thus we can study a range of distinct accretion states in the same object , hence controlling for the effects of compact object mass , donor type and environment on the formation of jets in different accretion regimes .",
    "the properties of the accretion flow are best studied in the x - ray band , and have been categorised into a number of canonical states ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , which are identified by specific x - ray spectral and timing characteristics .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries spend the majority of their time in a very low luminosity ( @xmath0ergs@xmath1 ) quiescent state @xcite . at the beginning and end of an outburst",
    ", such systems are observed in the low / hard state ( lhs ) , with an x - ray spectrum dominated by a fairly hard power law component ( photon index @xmath2 ) , and a power density spectrum showing strong band - limited noise with integrated fractional rms variability @xmath3 . during the peak phase of an outburst , a black hole x - ray binary will make a transition through a set of intermediate states to the high / soft state ( hss ) .",
    "the hss has an x - ray spectrum dominated by soft thermal blackbody emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc , together with a weak , steep ( @xmath4 ) power - law component , and showing a power density spectrum with a much reduced fractional rms variability of @xmath5 .",
    "the intermediate states were classified by @xcite into two distinct classes , the hard and soft intermediate states ( hims and sims respectively ) , distinguished by both the photon index of the power law component and by their x - ray variability properties , notably a rapid decrease in the fractional rms variability and a transition between two types of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) on moving from the hims to the sims . at the end of the outburst ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity decreases , and the source makes a reverse transition from the hss through the hims back to the lhs .",
    "the reduced luminosity of the soft - to - hard transition as compared to the hard - to - soft transition leads to an observed hysteresis in a hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) . while there are alternative sets of state definitions , most notably those of @xcite , we have chosen to use the terminology outlined above primarily for consistency with much of the published literature on the coupling of radio and x - ray emission from black hole x - ray binaries , specifically the phenomenological picture presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relativistic jets in black hole x - ray binaries are seen in two distinct forms .",
    "steady , compact jets have been directly imaged in hard x - ray spectral states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are observed to have a flat or slightly inverted radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "they are best modelled as partially self - absorbed conical outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are believed to carry away a significant , if not dominant , fraction of the power liberated by the accretion flow @xcite . the second , more spectacular , type of jet morphology is seen during outbursts , as bright , steep - spectrum , discrete , relativistically - moving knots of radio emission . in most systems , these are only observed on milliarcsecond scales using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although for the brightest systems , they may be observed on larger angular scales with connected - element interferometers such as the very large array ( vla ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optically thin radio emission may also be observed some distance downstream from the x - ray binary itself if the jets run into a particularly dense patch of the surrounding interstellar medium , causing particle acceleration at the sites of the resulting external shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since this is dependent on the properties of the surrounding medium rather than the launching mechanism of the jets themselves , we will not focus on it in any detail .",
    "the relationship between the radio emission ( assumed to arise from the jets ) and the x - ray emission from the accretion flow was considered in detail by @xcite , who used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to sample the radio emission throughout the 2001 outburst of the black hole x - ray binary xte j1650 - 500 . comparing their data to similar outbursts in three other systems",
    ", they found that the hard state ( corresponding to the lhs in our terminology ) is associated with emission from a partially self - absorbed compact jet , which persists into the intermediate state ( equivalent to the hims ) .",
    "ejection events are associated with transitions from the intermediate to the steep power law state ( hims to sims transition ) , and the jet is suppressed in the thermal dominant state ( hss ) , although residual radio emission may be observed as a result of interactions between the ejecta and the surrounding environment .",
    "@xcite also made a detailed study of the relationship between the x - ray and radio emission ( the disc - jet coupling ) in a black hole x - ray binary , in this case focussing on the system grs1915 + 105 .",
    "although the x - ray spectral states in grs1915 + 105 are non - standard , multi - wavelength observations by @xcite also provided evidence that jet ejection events are triggered at the end of a phase of x - ray spectral softening .",
    "this was confirmed by high - resolution observations of a large radio flare @xcite , which measured the proper motions of the relativistic jets , showing them to be ejected as the source was moving from a relatively hard ` plateau ' state to a softer x - ray state .",
    "@xcite generalised this picture by synthesizing the existing data on the disc - jet coupling in several different black hole x - ray binaries into a ` unified model ' . in its simplest",
    "form , this model holds that the steady , compact jets exist during the quiescent state and lhs , with a relatively low bulk velocity ( lorentz factor @xmath6 ) .",
    "as the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) rises at the beginning of an outburst , so too does the jet power and hence the radio luminosity ( @xmath8 ) , following the non - linear correlation @xmath9 @xcite . as the source moves into the intermediate states , the x - ray spectrum softens and the jet lorentz factor increases , with the jet becoming unstable . at a certain point in the hid , dubbed the ` jet - line ' ,",
    "the core jet switches off , and a radio flare may occur as the faster moving material ejected more recently catches up with the pre - existing , slower - moving flow , giving rise to internal shocks , which accelerate particles to produce the observed bright , optically thin , relativistically - moving ejecta . alternatively , the shocks could be caused by increased outflow flux at constant velocity , rather than by a change in the bulk velocity .",
    "supporting such a scenario , the disappearance of the non - thermal power - law component of the x - ray spectrum at this time has led to suggestions that the shocks could be caused by the ejection of the corona and its subsequent interaction with material from the pre - existing steady jets @xcite . if the x - ray behaviour oscillates back and forth across the jet line , multiple radio flares",
    "may be observed , with the compact core jet reforming each time the spectrum becomes harder , and another ejection event occurring at the subsequent softening event . during the hss ,",
    "the compact core jet is suppressed by over two orders of magnitude @xcite , and reforms in the final stages of the outburst as the source moves from a hims back to the lhs .    while many authors have used this model as a benchmark against which to compare their observational data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it was evaluated in detail by @xcite , who attempted to couple the moment of jet ejection with particular x - ray spectral and timing features .",
    "while they verified the main features of the previous picture , they were unable to identify any unique x - ray signature of the jet ejection event ( the crossing of the jet line ) , probably due to the sparse radio coverage for most of the studied events .",
    "these authors identified a need for more intensive radio coverage during the transitional phases of the outburst , particularly in the form of high angular resolution vlbi monitoring .",
    "such resolved radio imaging is crucial in accurately interpreting the jet emission , since the peak in the radio light curve may not correspond to the exact time when the moving knots were ejected from the core .",
    "a clear example of this was identified by @xcite , who found that the jet emission in ss433 reached a maximum when crossing a ` brightening zone ' located @xmath10au downstream from the core .",
    "absorption effects , recollimation shocks , or the time delay required to form internal shocks could all prevent an accurate assessment of the disc - jet coupling when relying on radio flux density monitoring alone .",
    "first detected during an outburst in 1977 @xcite , h1743 - 322 was rediscovered as a new source in 2003 by integral @xcite , only subsequently being associated with the previously known source @xcite . since that time , seven smaller outbursts of the source have been observed @xcite , at least one of which failed to make a full transition through all the canonical states @xcite .    from its similarities with the dynamically",
    "confirmed black hole x - ray binary xte j1550 - 564 , the source was classified as a black hole candidate @xcite , although no mass function has yet been reported for the system . from its location only 3.2@xmath11  from the galactic centre , the source distance was assumed to be @xmath12kpc .",
    "this was recently confirmed by @xcite , who derived a distance of @xmath13kpc by modelling the trajectories of the radio jets during the 2003 outburst .",
    "@xcite measured quiescent magnitudes for the system of 17.1 at k - band and @xmath14 at @xmath15 band , but with no firm distance determination and uncertain contributions from the jet and outer disc , the spectral type of the secondary is also unknown . however , from the relation between orbital period and quiescent x - ray luminosity @xcite , and their measured quiescent luminosity of @xmath16ergs@xmath1 ( 0.510kev ) , @xcite inferred an orbital period of @xmath17h .    from the x - ray dipping behaviour observed by @xcite and @xcite , the inclination angle of the disc in h1743 - 322",
    "is believed to be relatively high , on the order of @xmath18@xmath11  to our line of sight .",
    "@xcite also determined the inclination angle of the radio jets to be @xmath19@xmath11 , implying that the disc and jet axes are therefore relatively well aligned .",
    "narrow , variable and blueshifted absorption lines from highly - ionized fe suggest a disk wind in this system @xcite , which was subsequently found to be partially state - dependent , with the wind being stronger in the high / soft state @xcite .",
    "the mass outflow rate in the wind was estimated as being on the order of @xmath20gs@xmath1 , assuming a wind velocity of 300kms@xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray and radio behaviour of the source during the 2003 outburst were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the event was complicated , with multiple transitions between the different x - ray spectral states , and several different radio flaring events .",
    "owing to the rapid x - ray variability , complicated outburst behaviour and sparse radio sampling , no detailed comparison of the jet - disc coupling with the phenomenological model of @xcite was possible .",
    "several months after the 2003 outburst , moving radio emission was detected at arcsecond scales on either side of the central source , subsequently discovered to be associated with x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "these were interpreted as the interaction of the ejecta from the original outburst with the surrounding environment . while the jets were found to have decelerated since the 2003 event , the observations placed constraints on the position angle of the jets and on their apparent velocity .    in this paper , we present detailed radio observations of the 2009 outburst of h1743 - 322 .",
    "the x - ray evolution of the outburst has already been analysed in detail by @xcite and @xcite , and the source was found to follow the canonical path through the hid , with a relatively simple evolution as compared to the 2003 event . the dense radio coverage at high angular resolution , coupled with the simple , canonical behaviour in the x - ray band , allowed us to make a detailed study of the disc - jet coupling in this system , testing the model of @xcite and addressing some of the issues raised by @xcite .",
    "the outburst was monitored with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , and its x - ray spectral and timing characteristics have been used by @xcite to distinguish the various characteristic accretion states .",
    "we monitored the outburst in the radio band using the vla and very long baseline array ( vlba ) under the auspices of the jet acceleration and collimation probe of transient x - ray binaries ( jacpot xrb ) program @xcite , tracking the evolution of the radio emission through the entire outburst .",
    "we also obtained data from the atca to improve our temporal coverage in the radio band .",
    "after _ swift _ reported a re - brightening of h1743 - 322 in the 1550kev band from 2009 may 22 @xcite , we made preliminary radio observations with the vla , detecting the source at a level of 2.2mjy at 8.4ghz @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this detection , we triggered a long - term vla monitoring campaign ( program code am991 ) , tracking the radio emission from the source over 24 epochs as it made the transition from the lhs to the hss , and again as it made the reverse transition back to the lhs ( see table  [ tab : vla ] for more details ) .",
    "the array was in its cnb and c configurations during the observations , with the configuration change occurring on 2009 june 16 .",
    "the monitoring was carried out at frequencies of 1.4 , 4.9 and 8.4ghz , with two epochs of observation at 22.4ghz during the peak of the radio outburst in an attempt to better constrain the source spectrum when the source was brightest .",
    "we observed in dual - polarization mode with 100mhz of bandwidth per polarization , split equally between two intermediate frequency ( if ) pairs .",
    "we used 3c286 as a primary calibrator , setting the amplitude scale according to the coefficients derived at the vla in 1999 by staff at the national radio astronomy observatory , as implemented in the 31dec08 version of the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the secondary calibrator was j1744 - 3116 , at an angular separation of 1@xmath11  from h1743 - 322 .",
    "observations were carried out in fast - switching mode with a 4-min cycle time ( 1min on the calibrator , 3min on the target source ) to minimize down time while maximizing the accuracy of the phase transfer at the low elevation of the sources .",
    "data reduction was carried out according to standard procedures within aips .",
    "the observations were typically of duration 1h split across all observing frequencies , and were simultaneous with monitoring at the vlba wherever possible .",
    "on a few occasions , the weather was sufficiently bad that the calibrator phase changed by several tens of degrees over the course of a 60-s scan .",
    "at these epochs , the interpolation of phases to the target source was poor , and since h1743 - 322 was not bright enough for self - calibration we were unable to correct for this effect , leading to larger than expected errors on the measured source brightnesses .",
    "in one instance , on 2009 july 4 , the weather was sufficiently bad ( phase changing by @xmath21@xmath11  within 60s ) that the target source could not be detected .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we analysed all publicly available observations of the 2003 and 2009 outbursts of h1743 - 322 in the _ rxte _ archive .",
    "the data were reduced using the heasoft software package v6.8 , following the standard steps described in the _ rxte _ cookbook .",
    "we constructed hardness intensity diagrams ( hids ) from the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "we produced background subtracted light curves binned at 16s using pca standard 2 mode data from proportional counter unit ( pcu ) 2 ( all layers ) .",
    "the light curves were divided into three energy bands , 2.14.9 , 8.618.3 and 2.118.3 kev ( according to the correspondence between fixed energy channels and energy valid for pca gain epoch 5 ) .",
    "we defined the hardness ratio ( hr ) as the ratio of count rate in the bands 8.618.3 kev and 2.14.9 kev and the intensity as the count rate in the energy band 2.118.3 kev .",
    "all the observations we used fall in pca gain epoch 5 ( from 2000 may 13 until the present ) . however , ( small ) continuous gain changes are reported within one epoch . to correct for this effect , which could affect our comparison of the 2003 and 2009 outbursts , we estimated the variation of the hr of the crab between 2003 and 2009 .",
    "because the spectrum of the crab is supposed to be constant , any changes observed in the hardness of the crab are most probably caused by changes in the instrumental response .",
    "we selected rxte observations covering the same period as our observations of h1743 - 322 .",
    "we estimated an increase of @xmath22 per cent in the average hr of the crab from 2003 to 2009 .",
    "consequently , we divided all the hrs calculated for h1743 - 322 in 2009 by a factor 1.057 to match the 2003 data .",
    "the changes in the pca gain , although small , might also affect the source count rate . on average , the crab count rate in the 2.118.3 kev decreased by @xmath23 per cent from 2003 to 2009 .",
    "we thus corrected the intensities of h1743 - 322 to account for this change .",
    "to determine the spectral state of the source at the time of each rxte observation , we used the classifications of @xcite .",
    "these were based on timing properties ( the fractional rms variability , the presence of qpos , and the overall shape of the power density spectra ) , hardness ratios , and also on the relative contributions of disc and power - law components to the x - ray spectra ( see for example their fig .  5 ) .",
    "this latter diagnostic was important in distinguishing the sims ( with significant power - law contribution ) from the hss ( dominated by the thermal disc emission ) , since the fractional rms variability and hardness ratios could be very similar in these two states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743_lcs ] ) .",
    "the radio light curves and the evolution with time of the radio spectral index @xmath24 ( defined as @xmath25 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743_lcs ] . also plotted for comparison purposes are the x - ray count rate , hardness and integrated fractional rms variability from _",
    "rxte_/pca monitoring , together with the x - ray state classifications of @xcite .",
    "as expected ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , changes in the radio emission are more closely coupled with x - ray spectral and timing information than with the overall x - ray light curve .    by the time we triggered our observing campaign , the source was already in the hims , with a steady radio flux density of @xmath26mjy and a flat radio spectrum .",
    "this persisted until the end of the hims , after which the atca detected a quenching of the radio emission and a steepening of the radio spectrum to @xmath27 on mjd54986.6 .",
    "quenching of the radio emission prior to a major ejection event is a well - known phenomenon in cygnus x-3 @xcite , and has also been observed in xte j1859 + 226 @xcite , associated with a brief steepening of the radio spectrum .",
    "it is likely that this observation corresponds to the phase of instability in the jet prior to the main outburst noted by @xcite .    within 0.8d of the atca detection of quenched radio emission ,",
    "the vlba detected the onset of the radio flare , on mjd54987.3 .",
    "this observation was almost simultaneous with the first x - ray detection of the sims .",
    "the peak of the radio outburst , as detected with the atca , reached 26.2mjy on mjd54988.8 , and the radio brightness as measured by all instruments then decreased for the next 14d as the source moved into the hss . at the peak of the flare ,",
    "the radio spectrum was slightly inverted , consistent with expanding synchrotron plasma that was self - absorbed at lower frequencies , with a turnover in the observed atca frequency range .",
    "while _ rxte _ detected an excursion from the hss back into the sims on mjd54990.3 , the radio sampling was too coarse to detect a temporary rebrightening at this time .",
    "the vlba did not detect the source on mjd54990.3 , and the measured vla radio brightness on mjd54991.4 was consistent with the decay from the original flare .",
    "the only evidence for a second ejection event is the inverted spectrum between 4.9 and 8.5ghz on mjd54989.2 ( @xmath28 ) . given that these data were taken after the peak of the main flare as measured by atca , this suggests the early stages of a second ejection event .    following this vla detection of an inverted spectrum ,",
    "the radio spectra were steep during the hss .",
    "the source was detected throughout this phase of the outburst , with a slight increase in the brightness at 8.5ghz on mjd55005.3 , following which the radio emission was relatively stable at a level of @xmath3mjy .",
    "the unified model of @xcite suggests that the compact core jet should be suppressed in this phase , so one likely explanation for the low - level emission observed at late times in the hss is an ongoing interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium through which it was propagating ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* to explain the residual radio emission detected in the hss of xte j1650 - 500 ) .",
    "however , the source was not detected with the vlba during this period , and the relatively compact configurations of the vla and the atca did not provide sufficient resolution to distinguish between any such external shocks and a compact core jet .",
    "thus in the absence of either spectral or imaging information , we can not verify this hypothesis .",
    "after the reverse transition to the hims , the radio brightness showed a second slight increase , to @xmath29mjy , with a spectrum consistent with being flat .",
    "we interpret this as the reignition of the compact core jet . as the x - ray emission decayed late in the outburst",
    ", the radio brightness also decreased , reaching 0.1mjy by mjd55050.3 .",
    "h1743 - 322 was detected by the vlba on 5 occasions during the outburst ( table  [ tab : vlba ] ) .",
    "three of these were during the hims prior to the radio flare , and the following two were during the rise phase and at the peak of the flare .",
    "the resulting images , together with the stacked image from all data during the outburst decay , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743_8ghz ] . in the first three observations during the hims , we detected only the compact core jet , which was unresolved down to a beam size of @xmath30mas in p.a .",
    "6.6@xmath11  e of n. in contrast , at the peak of the flare , we observed two distinct components , suggesting a two - sided ejection event .",
    "we note that the weak component seen at the eastern edge of the vlba image from 2009 june 5 ( with relative co - ordinates ( 65,-23)mas in r.a .  and",
    ", respectively ) has a significance of @xmath31 . given the marginal nature of this detection , and since its orientation is not aligned with the observed axis of the bright jet components , we do not believe it to be real .      in the initial lhs ,",
    "the flux density measured with the vlba was at a level consistent ( at the 2@xmath32-level ) with that observed during the quasi - simultaneous vla and atca observations .",
    "however , the two vlba observations during the rise and at the peak of the flare recovered only 2550 per cent of the integrated flux density measured a few hours later by the atca .",
    "although this could indicate excess diffuse emission that was resolved out by the vlba , it is likely that the majority of the discrepancy can be attributed to either timing effects during the rise phase of the flare , or to atmospheric phase decorrelation .",
    "the vlba observation on mjd @xmath33 was taken during the rise phase of the flare , 6 hours prior to the closest atca observation .",
    "the atca data ( table [ tab : atca ] ) show that the 9-ghz radio emission increased from 0.2 to 24.2mjy over the 24-hour period from mjd 54986.6 to 54987.6 , so a 6-hour time offset could correspond to a significant change in flux density .    to test the effects of phase decorrelation",
    ", we compared the flux density recovered from the calibrator sources j1748 - 2907 and j1740 - 2929 after applying the phase corrections derived using j1744 - 3116 , with that derived from self - calibration of those same two sources .",
    "this showed that phase decorrelation could reduce the recovered flux density by up to 50 per cent on mjd 54987.3 , and by up to 25 per cent on mjd 54988.3 ( when the atmosphere was presumably somewhat more stable ) .",
    "taking into account the effects of both time offsets and atmospheric phase decorrelation , we conclude that although we can not rule out the existence of diffuse emission that is resolved out by the vlba , such a component is not required to reconcile the measured vlba fluxes with those seen at the atca .",
    "given the high inclination of the system and the presence of a disk wind @xcite , we should address whether there is any evidence for free - free absorption in the inner radio - emitting regions , as has been found in the case of ss433 @xcite .",
    "since the outflow rate estimated for the wind in h1743 - 322 @xcite is several orders of magnitude lower than that in the equatorial wind of ss433 @xcite , there should be significantly less free - free absorbing material along our line of sight to the inner jets .",
    "this is supported by the radio spectrum , which is only ever highly inverted ( as would be expected for free - free absorption ) during the rise phase of the flare ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743_lcs ] ) , when an inverted spectrum can be attributed to low - frequency synchrotron self - absorption in the expanding ejecta .",
    "finally , we always detect the core of the system with our vlba imaging during the hims , at a position intermediate between the eastern and western jet ejecta seen later in the outburst ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h1743_8ghz ] ) .",
    "thus there is no reason to believe that there is significant free - free absorption in the inner regions of the system .",
    "the early triggering of the observations and consequent detection of the compact core jet provided a point of reference for the subsequent observations during the radio outburst .",
    "we measured the source position , relative to the assumed position of the calibrator source j1744 - 3116 as given in table  [ tab : calibrators ] .",

    "we must add a systematic error of 2.7mas in r.a .  and 8.0mas in dec .",
    "from combining the quoted uncertainty on the calibrator position and the uncertainty from the calibrator throw to j1744 - 3116 ( using a linear extrapolation of the results of @xcite to the low declination of the target source ) .",

    "on mjd54988 , we see two radio - emitting components , aligned along an axis oriented @xmath38 e of n. this is fully consistent with the jet axis ( @xmath39 for the eastern jet , @xmath40 for the western jet ) determined by @xcite , suggesting that the jet axis has not precessed since 2003 .",

    "since we detect radio emission in the hss which we attribute to external shocks as the jets interact with the surrounding medium , we must address the question of whether this rebrightening is due to further external shocks , or to the reignition of the compact core jet . from table  [",
    "tab : vla ] , we see that the error bars on the radio spectral indices are too large to accurately discriminate between a flat spectrum compact jet and optically thin ejecta .",
    "however , since there is no further jump in radio brightness between the first detection in the hims and the lhs , when we believe the compact jet should be present , this suggests that the radio brightening seen between the hss and the hims is indeed due to the reactivation of the core jet .",
    "the compact core jet is not detected in the individual vlba data sets during the reverse transition . stacking the vlba data from the hims and lhs during the reverse transition",

    "since the jet axis seen by the vlba at the peak of the outburst agrees so well with that observed several years earlier by @xcite , we can rule out precession of the jets . combined with the marginal nature of the detection , its position angle ( almost perpendicular to the jet axis , in the absence of significant systemic proper motion ) makes it probable that this detection is simply a noise spike .",
    "given the noise level of 0.08mjybeam@xmath1  in our stacked image , we might have expected to detect the compact core jet , given the flux densities of 0.410.63mjy measured by the vla over this period .",
    "our vlba non - detection might therefore suggest that the emission measured by the vla was sufficiently extended to be resolved out by the vlba , and might therefore be attributed to diffuse emission downstream in the jets .",
    "however , the phase decorrelation of up to 50 per cent reported in section [ sec : imaging ] would reduce the source flux density below the detection threshold in the stacked vlba image , so the vlba non - detection can not be used as evidence for extended emission downstream in the jets .    assuming , therefore , that we are indeed seeing the reactivation of the compact core jet at the transition from the hss to the hims , this re - ignition of the radio emission occurs well before the optical / nir jet is believed to switch on at the transition to the lhs .",
    "a similar sequence of events was also seen by @xcite during the soft - to - hard transition in gx339 - 4 .",
    "we can contrast this with the known behaviour during the hard - to - soft transition .",
    "@xcite showed that the optical / nir jets are suppressed at the top - right hand corner of the hid , as the x - ray emission begins to soften , while the radio flaring event and compact jet quenching occurs 712d later , at the hypothesised ` jet line ' .",

    "thus , it seems that the quenching and reactivation of the jets at the beginning and end of an outburst are gradual processes , occurring at different times for the radio and optical / nir jets .",
    "any discussion of these phenomena should therefore be very clear as to the wavelength at which the jets are being observed .",
    "a possible explanation for the observed sequence of events could be that the jet power evolves over the course of several days , with the spectral break from optically thick to thin moving to lower / higher frequencies with time at the beginning / end of the outburst ( the frequency of the spectral break determines the total radiative power of the jets ) .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that it takes time for the suppression of the flow in the inner regions to propagate outwards to the surface of optical depth unity at radio frequencies .",
    "however , since the compact , hard - state jets are not resolved in vlbi observations ( see fig .  [",

    ". therefore a full interpretation would also need to account for hysteresis effects ( i.e.  the time taken for the system to respond to the ongoing changes in mass accretion rate over the first few weeks of the outburst ) .",
    "jet ejection events have in the past been associated with the transition from the hims to sims , defined by a drop in the fractional rms variability and the appearance of type b qpos @xcite .",
    "our radio monitoring of the 2009 outburst of h1743 - 322 shows that the peak of the integrated radio light curve is not necessarily the best indicator of the date of the radio ejection event , likely owing to the time taken for shocks to form and become optically thin .",
    "when attempting to connect radio and x - ray behaviour that vary on timescales of days , this time delay can mask the signature of any causal connection .",
    "this highlights the crucial role of high - cadence , high - angular resolution vlbi monitoring during state transitions in order to pin down the exact sequence of events .    in the 2009 outburst of h1743 - 322",
    ", we find that the jet ejection event occurred during or just before the sharp drop in the rms variability , coinciding ( within the three - day uncertainty ) with the disappearance of type c qpos and the quenching of the compact jet .",
    "the first detection of type b qpos occured several days later ( albeit with the caveat of the sparsely - sampled transition ) .",
    "this sequence of events is approximately consistent with what was seen in the outbursts of xte j1550 - 564 , xte j1859 + 226 and xte j1752 - 223 .",
    "however , the 2002 outburst of gx339 - 4 suggests that the drop in rms variability is not causally connected to the radio flare , as noted by @xcite , although the evolution away from the canonical type c qpos could still be associated with the radio flare .",
    "but even this appears to be ruled out by the 2003 outburst of h1743 - 322 .",
    "we note that these latter two outbursts are the only ones in the sample we considered that did not appear to be preceded by any significant radio quenching .",
    "either the time sampling of the radio data was too sparse to detect a brief ( @xmath85d ) period of quenching , or the physical properties ( or , more speculatively , the launching mechanisms ) of the ejection events were different in these two outbursts .",
    "in summary , the spectral hardness at which the jets are ejected and the radio flare occurs appears to vary between outbursts ( even for an individual system ) .",
    "while x - ray timing studies may be better signatures of an ejection event , the exact causal sequence of events appears to vary between outbursts , as originally deduced by @xcite . in the subset of cases where radio quenching is observed",
    ", the ejection event seems to be connected to the point at which the type c qpos and band - limited noise disappear from the x - ray power density spectrum and the fractional variability begins to decrease . while we have shown that intensive vlbi observations have the capacity to pin down the moment of ejection , dedicated coverage of new outbursts with both high angular resolution radio monitoring and x - ray timing observations is crucial to find out whether there is any common pattern to the sequence of events and hence any causal connection between the accretion and outflow phenomena . in this light",
    ", the end of the _ rxte _ mission implies that prior to the advent of _ astrosat _",
    "@xcite , such studies may only be carried out with _",
    "xmm - newton_.    the radio emission from the compact core jet appears to reactivate during the hims ; it does not require the source to first reach the lhs , as appears to be necessary for the reactivation of the optical / nir jets .",
    "we speculate that the suppression and reactivation of the jet near the beginning and end of an outburst , respectively , occur via a gradual decrease / increase in the total jet power , over the course of several days .",
    "if this is the case , travel - time arguments coupled with the unresolved nature of the core jets make this inconsistent with a picture in which the suppression is due to the compact core jet being switched off instantaneously at the base , with the spectral break moving to lower frequencies with time as the motion of the ejected material takes it past the surfaces of optical depth unity at each frequency .",
    "the instantaneous suppression scenario is also ruled out by the gradual evolution of the optical / nir emission over the course of a few days .",
    "since this emission comes from a region @xmath85 light second downstream , suppression of the jet would instantaneously shut down the optical / nir jet emission , which is not observed .    reconciling our speculative scenario of gradual jet power evolution with the internal shock scenario of @xcite",
    "would require the gradual decrease in jet power during the hard to soft state transition to be coupled with an increase in either the jet velocity or outflow flux , contradicting the naive assumption that jet power would be positively correlated with jet velocity and outflow flux .",
    "thus a later , separate ejection of faster - moving material might be more consistent with the observations ( possibly due to the ejection of the corona , as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this also fits in with what we know about the well - documented radio quenching prior to major radio outbursts in cygnus x-3 @xcite .",
    "the jet speed in that system is thought to be high ( @xmath86 * ? ? ? * ) , whereas the radio quenching can last for up to two months @xcite , with the end of the quench phase being immediately followed by a major radio flare .",
    "thus , if the same process is responsible for the radio quenching in cygnus x-3 and the other x - ray binaries we have studied , the onset of the quench phase can not be directly linked to the ejection event .",
    "a more plausible explanation might be a subsequent , higher - velocity ejection of material towards the end of the quench phase .",
    "we have presented high - cadence radio and x - ray monitoring of the 2009 outburst of the black hole candidate x - ray binary system h1743 - 322 , using data from _ rxte _ , the vla , vlba and atca .",
    "the x - ray behaviour of the outburst was fairly standard , following the canonical path in the hardness - intensity diagram .",
    "since the radio behaviour was fairly clean , likely consisting of a single bright ejection event , we were able to use our high angular resolution vlbi radio monitoring to track the proper motion of the jet components and pin down the moment of jet ejection .",
    "the time of ejection appears to correspond , within uncertainties , to the beginning of the decrease in the fractional rms variability seen in the x - ray data , and to the disappearance of type c quasi - periodic oscillations ( i.e.  to the transition from the hard intermediate state to the soft intermediate state ) .",
    "a quenching of the radio emission occurs during or immediately after the initial ejection event , and there is a delay before the onset of the radio flare , likely due to the time taken for internal shocks to form in the outflow .",
    "this implies that the onset of the radio flare may not always be a good diagnostic of the moment of ejection , an assumption which has frequently been made in the past and may have hampered previous attempts to couple the radio and x - ray behaviour during black hole x - ray binary outbursts .",
    "the reactivation of the compact core jet at the end of the outburst appeared to occur during the transition from the high soft state to the hard intermediate state , and did not require the source to first reach the low hard state , as appears to be necessary for the detection of the compact jets in the optical / nir .",
    "this suggests that the compact jet power may evolve gradually over a period of several days during its initial suppression and subsequent reactivation near the beginning and end of an outburst , respectively .",
    "a comparison between the outbursts of 2003 and 2009 suggests that the jet speed in h1743 - 322 may be variable , and possibly positively correlated with the luminosity of the outburst .",
    "if the identification of the ejection event is correct in both outbursts , the x - ray spectral and timing signatures of the jet launching event are not constant between these two outbursts of the same source . however , the reverse transition occurred at a very similar luminosity in both outbursts , from which we estimate a galactic centre distance and a relatively high - mass compact object for h1743 - 322 .",
    "comparison with previous outbursts appears to validate the conclusion of @xcite that there may be no single x - ray signature of the dramatic changes in the jet properties during a state transition .",
    "however , more intensive radio monitoring , at high angular resolution , is required to make a conclusive statement in this regard .",
    "we are very grateful to the nrao , _ rxte _ and _ swift _ schedulers for their flexibility and prompt responses which have made these observing campaigns feasible .",
