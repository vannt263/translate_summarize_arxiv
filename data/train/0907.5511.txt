    "after years of study to understand how the nucleon spin originates from the constituent partons , an exhaustive answer is still missing .",
    "moreover , while a lot of information has been gathered concerning the longitudinal structure of a fast moving nucleon ( with respect to its direction of motion ) , very little is known about the transverse structure . in recent years these aspects have raised a lot of interest and after important theoretical developments and experimental findings , transverse spin and transverse momentum @xmath0 of the quarks are by now considered as fundamental ingredients in the description of the hadron structure .",
    "spin-@xmath0 correlations give rise to various observables in hard hadronic processes such as the azimuthal asymmetries seen both in unpolarized or transversely polarized semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , and led to the introduction of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and fragmentation functions ( ff ) . among these functions of special interest",
    "are the sivers functions @xmath3",
    "@xcite , which describe an azimuthal asymmetry in the parton distributions inside a transversely polarized nucleon , and by their chirally - odd partner @xmath4 , the boer - mulders functions  @xcite , describing the transverse parton polarization inside an unpolarized hadron , and generating azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarized sidis .",
    "compass results on the sivers asymmetries are given elsewhere  @xcite while here the unpolarized azimuthal asymmetries are presented .",
    "the cross - section for hadron production in lepton - nucleon dis @xmath5 for unpolarized targets and an unpolarized or longitudinally polarized beam is the following  @xcite : @xmath6    & & \\left .",
    "+ \\varepsilon_2 \\cos(2\\phi_h ) f^{\\cos\\ ; 2\\phi_h}_{uu } + \\lambda_\\mu    \\varepsilon_3    \\sin",
    "\\phi_h f^{\\sin \\phi_h}_{lu } \\right ]   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the fine structure constant , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the inclusive dis variables , @xmath11 is the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried by the detected hadron , @xmath12 is the azimuthal angle of the outgoing hadron in the @xmath13-nucleon system .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are structure functions , with the first and second subscripts which indicate the beam and target polarization respectively , and the last subscript which , if present , indicates the polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "finally @xmath19 is the beam longitudinal polarization and : @xmath20 \\varepsilon_2 & = & \\dfrac{2(1-y)}{1+(1-y)^2 } \\\\[2ex ] \\varepsilon_3 & = & \\dfrac{2 y \\sqrt{1-y}}{1+(1-y)^2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] are depolarization factors .",
    "the boer - mulders pdfs contribute to both the @xmath21 and the @xmath22 structure functions , together with the so called cahn effect  @xcite which arises from the fact that the kinematics is non collinear when the @xmath0 is taken into account ( i.e. a kinematical higher twist ) , and with the perturbative gluon radiation , resulting in order @xmath23 qcd processes .",
    "pqcd effects are becoming important for high transverse momenta @xmath24 of the produced hadrons , while are small for @xmath24 up to 1 gev@xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 modulation , which arises from the natural polarization of the muon beam , does not have a clear interpretation in the parton model .    in the past",
    ", azimuthal asymmetries have been measured by the emc collaboration  @xcite , with a liquid hydrogen target and a muon beam at a slightly higher energy , but without separating hadrons of different charge .",
    "these data have been used  @xcite to extract the average @xmath27 .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries have been also measured by e665  @xcite and at higher energies by zeus  @xcite .",
    "more recent are the compass results first presented at  @xcite , and the measurements done by hermes , first shown at  @xcite .",
    "the compass experiment has been set up at the cern sps m2 beam line .",
    "it combines high rate beams with a modern two stage magnetic spectrometer@xcite .",
    "compass has collected data with a 160 gev positive muon beam impinging on a polarized solid target .",
    "the beam is naturally polarized by the @xmath28decay mechanism , and the beam polarization is estimated to be @xmath29 with a @xmath30 relative error .",
    "the beam intensity is @xmath31 muons per spill .    up to",
    "2006 the experiment has used @xmath1lid as deuteron target because its favorable dilution factor of @xmath320.4 , particularly important for the measurement of . in 2007",
    "an ammonia nh@xmath33 target has been used as proton target .",
    "polarizations of 50% and 90% have been reached , respectively for the two target materials .",
    "the event selection requires standard dis cuts , i.e. @xmath34 , mass of the final hadronic state @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the detection of at least one hadron in the final state .",
    "moreover only events with a vertex in the forward target cell are used in order to minimize nuclear interactions and for a better data / monte carlo agreement .",
    "finally , for the detected hadrons it is also required that :    r0.50         * the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried by the hadron be @xmath37 to select hadrons from the current fragmentation region ; * @xmath38 , where @xmath24 is the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction , for a better determination of the azimuthal angle @xmath12 .    data taken both with a longitudinally polarized and a transversely polarized target have been used , mixing positive or negative orientations in order to cancel effects depending on the polarization of the nucleons .",
    "this statistics corresponds to almost 1 month of the 2004 data taking and after all the cuts consists of @xmath39 positive hadrons and @xmath40 negative hadrons entering the asymmetry calculations .    in the measurement of unpolarized asymmetries all the methods used to cancel the experimental acceptance",
    "can not be adopted and the correction for this effect is mandatory before fitting the azimuthal modulation .",
    "this is done by using a full monte carlo chain , which starts from the sidis event generation performed by lepto@xcite , simulate the experimental setup and the particle interactions in the passive and active material of the detectors ( also including the detector response done by comgeant ) , and ends with the reconstruction of the generated events by the same program ( coral ) used to analyze the real data .",
    "the quality of this chain is evaluated by comparing distributions of real data and of generated events both for the dis variables and for the hadronic variables .    the experimental acceptance as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath41",
    "is then calculated as the ratio of reconstructed over generated events for each bin of @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath24 on which the asymmetries are measured .",
    "the overall @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath24 acceptances are quite constant over the range used in the analysis , so that the effect coming by the integration over the unlooked variables when the asymmetries in one of the variables are extracted is well within the systematic error . the measured distribution , corrected for acceptance",
    "is fitted with the following functional form : @xmath42 an example of a measured azimuthal distribution , acceptance corrections and corrected azimuthal distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ azidist ] , together with the resulting fit .",
    "the contribution of the acceptance corrections to the systematic error has been studied with care . as the asymmetries were extracted from data taken",
    "both with longitudinal and transverse target configurations , comparing the two results gives the effect of the acceptance changes due to the different configuration ( solenoid vs. dipole ) of the target magnet and to the different direction of the incoming beam ( for the transverse setup the beam is bent in order to leave the target with the same direction as in the longitudinal case ) . in order to check the effect of the simulation parameters the acceptances have been calculated using two different sets of lepto parameters .",
    "all the resulting asymmetries were compared in order to quantify the systematic error in each kinematical bin .",
    "further systematic tests , like splitting the data sample according to the event topology and to the time of the measurement , gave no significant contributions .",
    "r0.65         the @xmath43 asymmetries , not shown here , measured by compass are compatible with zero , at the present level of statistical and systematic errors , over the full range of @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath24 covered by the data .",
    "the @xmath21 asymmetries extracted from compass deuteron data are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cosphi ] for positive ( upper row ) and negative ( lower row ) hadrons , as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath24 .",
    "the bands indicate the size of the systematic error .",
    "the asymmetries show the same trend for positive and negative hadrons with a slightly larger values for the positive one .",
    "values as large as 30@xmath4440% are reached in the last point of the @xmath11 range .",
    "the theoretical predictions  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ f : cosphi ] takes into account the cahn effect only , which does not depend on the hadron charge .",

    "are assumed to be proportional to the sivers function as extracted from the preliminary hermes data .",
    "the compass data show different amplitude for positive and negative hadrons , a trend which confirms the theoretical predictions .",
    "there is a satisfactory agreement between the data points and the model calculations , which hints to a non zero boer - mulders pdfs .",
