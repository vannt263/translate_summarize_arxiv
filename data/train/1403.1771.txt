    "the original axelrod model  @xcite , despite its simplicity , has been accepted as a model describing social influence with respect to the interaction among individuals  @xcite .",
    "the interacting individuals of the axelrod model are located on a regular two - dimensional square lattice and are characterized by a set of @xmath11 cultural features , whereas each feature can assume one of the @xmath4 cultural traits .",
    "each feature represents one of the cultural dimension , e.g. , language , religion , technology , style of dress , etc .",
    "the dynamics of this model runs in two steps repeated as required . in the first step ,",
    "an agent ( representing an individual ) and one of his neighbors are selected randomly . in the second step , the probability of interaction is calculated being proportional to the number of shared features .",
    "the interaction consists of selecting a feature at random in which the two agents differ , and setting this feature of the neighboring agent to be equal to the corresponding feature of the agent .",
    "it might seem that this mechanism leads to homogenization of society .",
    "however , it can lead either to a global homogenization ( the ordered phase ) or to a fragmented state ( disordered phase ) with coexistence of different homogeneous regions .",
    "one of the main results conjectures a critical value @xmath12 separating a monocultural state from the multicultural  @xcite .",
    "further details of the thermodynamic axelrod model and the out - of - equilibrium axelrod model are discussed in ref .",

    "we consider a classical multi - spin model of a social system treated from the point of view of the statistical mechanics .",
    "we focus our attention on behavior of a model of a large society in equilibrium .",
    "the society is represented by individuals who mutually interact via communication channels ( e.g. sharing interests ) with the nearest neighbors only .",
    "the society is subject to special rules given by a model of the statistical mechanics we have introduced for this purpose .",
    "a noise plays an important role in this study .",
    "the noise interferes with the communication channels . if it increases , the communicating individuals get less correlated on larger distances . in this way the noise acts against the formation of larger clusters of the individuals with a particular character , i.e. , a set of shared features . in such a cluster ,",
    "the individuals share a similar social background .",
    "the size of the clusters can be quantified by calculations of an appropriate order parameter , correlation length , etc .",
    ", which are commonly used in the statistical physics .",
    "if a phase transition point exists in a given statistical model , this point separates an ordered phase from the disordered .",
    "the two phases can be determined by the order parameter being non - zero within the ordered phase or zero in the disordered , provided that the system is infinitely ( sufficiently ) large , and the spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism occurred below the transition point .",
    "the noise can be also regarded as random perturbations ( cultural drift ) realized as a spontaneous change in a trait  @xcite and can play a significant constructive role in the out - of - equilibrium axelrod model . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of the noise for such non - linear dynamical systems is found to be size - dependent  @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , propose a multi - state spin model on the two - dimensional regular square lattice of the infinite size .",
    "each vertex of the lattice contains a multi - state spin variable ( being an individual with a certain cultural setting ) .",
    "we define special nearest - neighbor interactions among the spins representing a conditional communication among individuals .",
    "the statistical gibbs distribution introduces thermal fluctuations into our model with a multi - spin hamiltonian . here",
    ", the temperature can be identified as the noise we introduced above .",
    "imposing a constant magnetic field on given spin states makes the spins align accordingly , which might have had a similar effect as , for instance , the mass media or advertisement .",
    "having calculated the effects of the magnetic field , we observed a typical paramagnetic response in our model only , and no phase transition was observed .",
    "the model describes thermodynamic features of social influence studied by the well - known axelrod model  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently studied such thermodynamics features in the coupled potts models in one - dimensional lattices , where the phase transition occurs at zero temperature in accord with a thermodynamic one - dimensional interacting multi - state spin system .",
    "our studies go beyond this thermodynamic axelrod model conjectures since we intend to study phase transitions on social systems at non - zero temperature , where number of the individuals is infinite .",
    "therefore , the spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism selects a certain preferred cultural character resulting in a large cluster formation , which is characterized by a non - zero order parameter .",
    "this task is certainly nontrivial since our model has not been known to have an analytical solution .",
    "therefore , we apply the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) algorithm  @xcite , which is a powerful numerical tool in the statistical mechanics .",
    "the ctmrg calculates all thermodynamic functions to a high accuracy and enables to analyze the phase transitions as well as to control the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the phase transition temperature decreases with increasing number of traits @xmath4 as discussed later .",
    "we intend to investigate the asymptotic case in this paper , i.e. , the case when the number of the traits @xmath4 of each individual is infinite .",
    "then , we estimate the phase transition point in order to find out whether the ordered phase is permanently present or not . in other words ,",
    "the phase transition point @xmath2 is found to remain non - zero . throughout this paper",
    "we consider the case of @xmath3 only .",

    "the @xmath22 summation includes the horizontal and the vertical directions on the square lattice .",
    "let us generalize the spin clock model so that the interaction term @xmath0 contains a special attribute , i.e. , extra spins are added .",
    "we , therefore , introduce additional degrees of freedom to each vertex .",

    "it is instructive to introduce a @xmath5-variable @xmath35 .",

    "the potts - like interaction @xmath40 is represented by a diagonal @xmath41 matrix with the elements @xmath42 on the diagonal .",
    "thus defined model can also describe conditionally communicating ( interacting ) individuals of a society .",
    "the society is modeled by individuals ( @xmath43 ) and each individual has two distinguished features @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "each feature assumes @xmath4 different values ( traits ) .",
    "in particular , an individual positioned on @xmath46 vertex of the square lattice communicates with a nearest neighbor , say @xmath47 , by comparing the spin values of the first feature @xmath44 .",
    "this comparison is carried out by means of the @xmath4-state potts interaction .",
    "if the potts interaction is non - zero , the individuals communicate via the @xmath4-state clock interaction of the other feature with @xmath48 .",
    "the cosine enables a broader communication spectrum than the potts term .",
    "since we require symmetry in the _ potts - clock _ conditional communication , we include the other term in the hamiltonian , which exchanges the role of the features ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) in our model .",
    "in particular , the potts - like communication first compares the feature @xmath49 followed by the cosine term with the feature @xmath50 .",
    "( enabling extra interactions between the two features within each individual and/or the cross - interactions of the two adjacent individuals is to be studied elsewhere . )",
    "the total number of all the individuals is considered to be infinite in order to detect and analyze the phase transition when the spontaneous symmetry breaking is present .    in the framework of the statistical mechanics , we investigate a combined @xmath4-state potts and @xmath4-state clock model",
    "which is abbreviated as the @xmath5-state spin model . as an example",
    ", one can interpret the case of @xmath51 in the following : the feature @xmath44 can be chosen to represent _ leisure - time interests _ while the other feature @xmath45 can involve _",
    "working duties_. in the former case , one could list three properties such as reading books , listening to music , and hiking , whereas the latter feature could consist of manual activities , intellectual activities , and creative activities , as the example . the thermal fluctuations , induced by the thermodynamic temperature @xmath1 of the gibbs distribution , are meant to describe a noise hindering the communication .",
    "the higher the noise , the stronger suppression of the communication is resulted .",
    "we classify the phase transitions of our model by numerical calculation of the partition function @xmath52 @xmath53 especially , by its derivatives .",

    "a typical formulation of an observable ( an averaged thermodynamic function ) @xmath56 obeys the standard expression @xmath57 where the matrix @xmath58 is introduced being commonly called the _ reduced density matrix _ @xmath59 it is a classical counterpart of the one - dimensional quantum reduced density matrix in dmrg defined for a subsystem @xmath60 in contact with an environment @xmath61 .",
    "the reduced density matrix is defined on a line of the spins @xmath62 ( forming the subsystem @xmath60 ) between any of the two adjacent corner transfer matrices , whereas all the remaining spins variables form the environment @xmath61 .",

    "notice the normalization @xmath64 .",
    "its meaning is the partition function @xmath52 within the classical statistical physics and is normalized to unity .",
    "our model can be thought of as a system with two non - trivially coupled sub - lattices , where either sub - lattice is composed of the @xmath4-state variables with the given feature @xmath65 .      the _ helmholtz free energy _",
    "@xmath66 per spin site @xmath67 can be easily evaluated from the partition function by ctmrg .",
    "taking derivatives of the free energy determines other thermodynamic functions used in the classification of the phase transition .",
    "namely , the first derivative with respect to temperature @xmath1 results in the _ internal energy _ @xmath68 which is equivalent to the nearest - neighbor correlation function evaluated on the square lattice for the potts - like models @xmath69 the consequent derivative of the internal energy with respect to @xmath1 yields the _ specific heat _ @xmath70 which has a non - analytic ( divergent ) behavior at a phase transition .",
    "analogously , the first and the second derivatives of the free energy with respect to an external magnetic field @xmath71 results in the magnetization ( the order parameter ) and the susceptibility , respectively . another important thermodynamic function to be calculated is the _ entanglement von neumann entropy _ @xmath72 .",

    "a continuous transition usually leads to the second - order phase transition , and the discontinuous behavior signals the first - order phase transition .",

    "all of them yielded the non - zero transition temperature @xmath185 .",

    "a similar thermodynamic axelrod model with @xmath4-state potts interactions has been first studied analytically by gandica _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on one - dimensional chains only . in this case",
    "the typical thermodynamic properties of one - dimensional interacting spin systems were concluded with no phase transition , i.e. , the phase transition occurs at @xmath163 only .",
    "we have reproduced features of the @xmath5-state potts model and we have carried out numerical analyses on the identical hamiltonian of the thermodynamic axelrod model , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath7 and @xmath51 , with the respective non - zero phase transition temperature on the two - dimensional square lattice _",
    "cf . _ fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    the original out - of - equilibrium axelrod model in one dimension in the presence of the noise behaves like an ordinary thermodynamic one - dimensional interacting particle system described by the potts - like hamiltonian  @xcite . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the order - disorder transition induced by the noise depends on the value of @xmath4 , with the dependence becoming weaker for larger values of @xmath4 . in the cited paper",
    ", the system tends to homogeneity if the noise is low ( because of unstable disordered configurations with respect to the noise perturbations ) and vice versa , the system prefers heterogeneity whenever the noise rate gets strong ( disappearance of domains is compensated by creating the new ones ) .",
    "we considered the case of @xmath3 in our model , where we have observed a strong @xmath4-dependence .",
    "this affects the phase transition temperature ( the critical noise ) , which decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we have provided the thermodynamic analog of the axelrod model in two dimensions , cf .",
    "fig .  2 .",
    "in addition , our model does not contain the potts interactions only , but includes the clock model interactions with a richer communication structure ( interaction ) .",
    "such multi - spin model is again mapped onto mutually communicating individuals subject to a noise , which prevents them in communication .",
    "the gradual increase of the noise disables the formation of larger clusters of the individuals who share specific cultural features , e.g. , interests ( the cluster size is quantified by the order parameter ) .",
    "the raising noise suppresses correlations at longer distances and exhibits the same character as the thermal fluctuations .",
    "each individual is characterized by two independent features ( @xmath65 ) , and each feature assumes @xmath4 different traits ( interests ) resulting in @xmath5 cultural settings of each individual .",
    "we have found out that such social system exhibits two phase transitions when @xmath7 . using the above - mentioned examples , one can interpret results in the following : let , for instance , the first feature describe the two activities : ` reading of books ' ( @xmath187 ) and ` listening to music ' ( @xmath188 ) , whereas the second two - state feature involves ` manual activity ' ( @xmath189 ) and ` intellectual activity ' ( @xmath190 ) . both of the phase transitions are continuous separating three phases , which are classified into the ( i ) low - noise regime , ( ii ) the medium - noise regime , and ( iii ) the high - noise regime .",
    "\\(i ) in the low - noise regime , the individuals tend to form a single dominant cluster , where the complete order parameter has four values ( three if @xmath163 only ) , see fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the statistical probability of forming the dominant clusters is proportional to @xmath74 . if the noise increases and the complete order parameter decreases to the values of @xmath191 , the four different clusters are formed , and a final size of the dominant cluster ( chosen be setting the parameter @xmath80 ) decreases proportionally to this complete order parameter .",
    "( ii ) in the medium - noise regime , an interesting topological regime reveals just two equally likely traits of the individuals . in the social terms ,",
    "the pairing of the cultural settings coincides either with ( 1 ) the equal mixture of those individuals who ` read books ' and ` do manual activity ' ( @xmath192 ) and the individuals who ` listen to music ' and ` do intellectual activity ' ( @xmath193 ) or ( 2 ) the equal mixture of those who ` listen to music ' and ` do manual activity ' ( @xmath194 ) and those who ` read books ' and ` do intellectual activity ' ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "( iii ) in the high - noise regime , the clusters are not significant ( the correlation length decreases to zero if the noise increases ) , and the individuals behave in a completely uncorrelated way .",
    "a discontinuous phase transition of the first order is present when the number of the traits @xmath6 .",
    "in the low - noise regime , larger clusters of individuals with a given cultural setting ( out of @xmath5 ) are formed .",
    "the selected cultural setting of the dominant cluster sizes is proportional to the order parameter @xmath74 .",
    "this is equivalent to the ordered multi - state spin phase below the phase transition noise @xmath8 .",
    "the regime of the uncorrelated individuals ( disordered phase ) appears above the phase transition noise .",
    "the low - noise regime is separated from the high - noise regime by a discontinuity of the cluster size ( the complete order parameter ) .    in the asymptotic limit of the number of the traits ( the cultural settings ) , the extrapolation of the phase transition noise results in the non - zero @xmath179 .",
    "we conjecture that the phase transition noise @xmath179 remains finite ( being approximately @xmath196 ) .",
    "we interpret this result as the permanent existence of the correlated clusters below the non - zero phase transition point @xmath179 .",
