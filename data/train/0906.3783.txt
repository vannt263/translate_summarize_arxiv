    "isolated black holes have been investigated in great depth and detail for more than forty years . on the other hand ,",
    "black holes embedded in the background of the expanding universe are also important and even more realistic situations .",
    "some works on the issue have been carried out . in @xcite , mcvitie found a celebrated space - time describing a black hole embedded in the friedman - robertson - walker universe , which is generalized to the reissner - nordstrm case in @xcite . in @xcite , the model of swiss cheese black holes",
    "is shown . in @xcite ,",
    "the author suggested the vaidya s space - time describing a frw universe with a schwarzschild - like black hole that does not expand with the rest of the universe , which is generalized to the kerr - newman case in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the thakurta s black hole is shown . in @xcite ,",
    "the sultana - dyer black hole metric is suggested .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the authors suggested new solutions describing black holes embedded in the expanding universe .",
    "most of the models with the spherical symmetry on the topic are based on the assumption @xmath0 or @xmath1 where @xmath2 . here and after , we take @xmath3 .",
    "however , the space - time manifold described by the line element of eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) is singular at surfaces @xmath4 . and there",
    "also exists a singularity in the spacetime of eq.([frwschwbl ] ) at the surface @xmath5",
    ".    then we may ask whether the singularity in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) is a spacetime singularity or not ? if it is a proper singularity , is the singularity naked or covered by an apparent horizon ? in ref.@xcite , the authors claimed that , in the case of constant @xmath6 , the singularity is covered by an apparent horizon . however , we find such an apparent horizon does not exist if the null energy condition is satisfied .    in the paper ,",
    "firstly , we show that the space - time ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) is properly singular at the surface @xmath7 or @xmath8 respectively .",
    "secondly , we show the apparent horizon suggested in ref.@xcite does not exist .",
    "section [ conclusion ] contains conclusions and discussion .",
    "the metric of the mcvittie space - time @xcite is assumed as eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant parameter . in @xcite ,",
    "the metric is assumed as eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) , but @xmath11 is taken to be constant . here , we note that , if @xmath12 , the metrics in eq.([frwschwbl ] ) and eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) define the same space - time .",
    "generally , for @xmath13 , the two metrics represent different spacetimes . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the imperfect fluid stress - energy tensor is used to solve the einstein equations . in these models , at the surface @xmath7 , the spactimes are singular .",
    "let us show this by calculating the scalar curvature of the metric in eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17    obviously , in the limiting cases corresponding to the standard frw universe , the standard schwarzschild black hole or the schwarzchild - de sitter black hole , the scalar curvature @xmath18 is finite@xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we exclude these limiting cases . then for @xmath19 , @xmath18 is infinity at the surface @xmath4 . even for @xmath13",
    ", we find that it is almost impossible to find a time - dependent function @xmath11 to avoid the divergence at @xmath7 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath18 at @xmath4 implies the singularity is proper .",
    "the thakurta spacetime @xcite is based on the line element in eq.([frwschwbl ] ) .",
    "the scalar curvature of the metric ( [ frwschwbl ] ) is @xmath20 where @xmath21    still , we exclude the limiting cases corresponding to the standard frw universe , the standard schwarzschild black hole and the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole .",
    "then , similarly to the metric ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) , the scalar curvature @xmath22 at the surface @xmath8 is divergent .",
    "so the singularity at @xmath5 is proper .",
    "in@xcite , the authors showed that , in the case of @xmath23=0 , the singularity at the surface @xmath4 or @xmath5 in the space - time ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) respectively is covered by an apparent horizon . in this section",
    "we will show such an apparent horizon does not exist for the case of @xmath23=0 if the null energy condition holds .",
    "first , we show the outgoing light emitted from the surface @xmath24 in eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) or @xmath25 in eq.([frwschwbl ] ) can reach the future null infinity asymptotically if @xmath19 . considering the world line of a photon propagating along the direction of radius emitted from the point @xmath26 with constant @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", we have @xmath29 or @xmath30 for an outgoing photon which arrives @xmath31 at the moment @xmath32 , we obtain respectively @xmath33 or @xmath34 of course , we assum @xmath35 in eq.([timeandradiusi ] ) and @xmath36 in eq.([timeandradiuss ] ) , and @xmath37 in the two equations .    generally , since the einstein equations which determine @xmath37 and @xmath11 are unknown , nothing can be concluded from the equation ( [ timeandradiusi ] ) and ( [ timeandradiuss ] ) .",
    "but for the special case of @xmath19 , the integral on the right - hand sides of eq.([timeandradiusi ] ) is finite for finite @xmath38",
    ". then , in the spacetime of eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) , the light emitted from the point at the surface @xmath39 will reach the surface @xmath31 in the finite time .",
    "this implies that _ outgoing photons emitted outside the surface @xmath40 can reach the future null infinity asymptotically in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) if @xmath19_. in fact , this conclusion can be obtained easily from the conformal diagram of the sultana - dyer space - time , eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) with @xmath19 , given in fig.1 of ref.@xcite which is displayed as fig.[sultanadyer ] in our paper ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "the conformal diagram of the sultana - dyer spacetime .",
    "the horizontal wiggly line at the bottom describes the big bang singularity , the wiggly line at 45 degrees denotes the @xmath41 null singularity , and the solid line at 45 degrees describes future null infinity .",
    "null geodesics end at future null infinity or at the black singularity ( either when it is naked if started early on , or crossing the timelike black hole apparent horizon labelled ah).,width=245 ]    for the space - time ( [ frwschwbl ] ) , similar conclusion can be made from eq.([timeandradiuss ] ) .    here",
    ", we note that , generally , to obtain our conclusion , we should use the affine parameter @xmath42 in eq.([timeandradiusi ] ) or eq.([timeandradiuss ] ) instead of the coordinate time @xmath43 .",
    "but , fortunately , here the coordinate time @xmath43 is appropriate for our conclusion , since finite @xmath43 always indicates finite @xmath42 along the worldline of an outgoing photon outside the surface @xmath4 or @xmath5 in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) respectively .",
    "now let s assume that , outside the surface @xmath4 in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or the surface @xmath5 in the spacetime ( [ frwschwbl ] ) respectively , there exists an apparent horizon defined by the equation @xmath44 , if @xmath19 .",
    "then at the moment @xmath45 , a space - like two surface is defined by @xmath46 , and the expansion of the null generators of the future causal boundary of the two surface , @xmath27 , is zero at the two surface . due to the analysis in the last paragraph",
    ", we know outgoing photons emitted from the surface @xmath46 will reach the future null infinity asymptotically if @xmath19 .",
    "then , naturally , the outgoing future causal boundary of the two surface intersects the future null infinity .",
    "however , on the other hand , it is known that the raychaudhuri equation @xcite implies that the future causal boundary of the two surface @xmath46 can not intersect the future null infinity because @xmath27 is zero at the two surface @xmath46 and is nonincreasing if the null energy condition holds @xmath47 @xmath48 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath49 is a null vector .",
    "then we obtain two contrary conclusions from the assumption of the existence of the apparent horizon .",
    "this indicates that _ in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) , outside the surface @xmath4 or @xmath5 respectively , there does not exist any apparent horizon and the singularity at @xmath4 or @xmath5 is naked , if the null energy condition holds and @xmath19 .",
    "_    in particular , in the model of the sultana - dyer black hole @xcite , the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath50 where @xmath51 describes an ordinary massive dust and @xmath52 describes a null dust with density @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , the null energy condition is satisfied for any null vector @xmath49 .",
    "then we conclude that in the space time of the sultana - dyer black hole , there is no apparent horizon outside the surface @xmath4 in eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) and the singular surface @xmath4 is naked .",
    "the conclusion is different to that in @xcite .",
    "the issue on the solutions of the einstein equation describing black holes embedded in the frw universe is very important .",
    "some spacetime models on this issue @xcite have been suggested .",
    "most of the models are based on the assumption of eq.([frwschwbl ] ) or eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) .",
    "however , there exists singularity in the spacetime of eq.([frwschwbl ] ) or eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) .",
    "the singularity can not be eliminated even for the imperfect fluid stress - energy tensor to be used to solve the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "but it is argued that the singularity in the spacetime ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) at @xmath4 is gravitationally weak @xcite in the sense that it does not crush extended bodies which falls into it to zero volume @xcite . in this view , the line elements ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) and ( [ frwschwbl ] ) may still make some sense in physics .    in @xcite , the authors claimed that , for @xmath19 , there exists a regular apparent horizon @xmath55 inside which the surface @xmath4 in eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) is contained .",
    "however , our analysis above shows that photons emitted outside the surface @xmath4 can reach the future null infinity if @xmath19 .",
    "so the outgoing future causal boundary of the apparent horizon will intersect the future null infinity .",
    "however , if the null energy condition holds , it is impossible for the future causal boundary of the apparent horizon to intersect the future null infinity because of the non - decreasing expansion of the null generators of the causal boundary indicates by the raychaudhuri equation @xcite .",
    "then such an apparent horizon does not exist , and the singular surface is naked still if @xmath19 .",
    "the conclusion in @xcite may be due to the special coordinate @xmath56 .",
    "actually , the coordinate transformation between @xmath56 and the ones in eq.([isotropicfrwbl ] ) is not diffeomorphic globally , which is singular at the apparent horizon @xmath55 .",
    "our conclusion for the case of @xmath19 can not be applied to that of @xmath13 directly . however , since our analysis is based on two conditions : the null energy condition holds and outgoing photons emitted from the apparent horizon ( if exists ) can reach the future null infinity .",
    "then it is still possible for the existence of the apparent horizon outside the surface @xmath4 or @xmath5 in the space - time ( [ isotropicfrwbl ] ) or ( [ frwschwbl ] ) respectively , if the null energy condition is violated or outgoing photons emitted from the apparent horizon ( if exists ) can not reach the future null infinity .",
