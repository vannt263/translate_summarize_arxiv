    "the persistence problem is concerned with the fraction of space which persists in its initial @xmath2 state up to some later time @xmath0 .",
    "the problem has been extensively studied over the past decade for pure spin systems at both zero [ 1 - 4 ] and non - zero [ 5 ] temperatures .",
    "typically , in the non - equilibrium dynamics of spin systems at zero - temperature , the system is prepared initially in a random state and the fraction of spins , @xmath3 , that persists in the same state as at @xmath4 up to some later time @xmath0 is studied . for the pure ferromagnetic ising model on a square lattice",
    "the persistence probability has been found to decay algebraically [ 1 - 4 ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the non - trivial persistence exponent [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the actual value of @xmath7 depends on both the spin [ 6 ] and spatial [ 3 ] dimensionalities ; see ray [ 7 ] for a recent review . at non - zero temperatures [ 5 ] ,",
    "consideration of the global order parameter leads to a value of @xmath8 for the pure two - dimensional ising model .",
    "it has been only fairly recently established that systems containing disorder [ 8 - 10 ] exhibit different persistence behaviour to that of pure systems . a key finding [ 8 - 9,11 ] is the appearance of blocking  regardless of the amount of disorder present in the system . as well as theoretical models",
    ", the persistence phenomenon has also been studied in a wide range of experimental systems and the value of @xmath7 ranges from @xmath9 to @xmath10 [ 12 - 14 ] , depending on the system .",
    "a considerable amount of the recent theoretical effort has gone into obtaining the numerical value of @xmath7 for different models .    in this work",
    "we add to the knowledge and understanding regarding persistence by presenting the initial results for the persistence behaviour of a modified version of a recently proposed spin model which appears to reproduce the intermittent behaviour seen in real financial markets [ 15 ] .",
    "in the next section we discuss the model in detail . in the subsequent section",
    "we give an outline of the method used and the values of the various parameters employed .",
    "section iv describes the results and the consequent implications for using the models in a financial or social context . finally , in section",
    "v there is brief conclusion .",
    "the simulations were performed on a modified version of a spin model of financial markets proposed recently by bornholdt [ 15 ] .    in the original bornholdt model , @xmath11 market traders , denoted by ising spins @xmath12 ,",
    "are located on the sites of a hypercubic lattice .",
    "the action of the @xmath13th trader of buying or selling at time step @xmath0 corresponds to the spin variable @xmath14 assuming the value @xmath15 or @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "a local field , @xmath17 , determines the dynamics of the spins .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 where the first summation runs over the nearest neighbours of @xmath13 only ( @xmath19 , for nearest neighbours and @xmath20 , otherwise ) , @xmath21 couples to the magnetization , and @xmath22 is a second spin used to represent the strategy of agent @xmath13 .    subsequently , yamano [ 16 ] worked with a model where the local field is given by @xmath23 although here the strategy spin is omitted , the coupling constant is retained .",
    "furthermore , the nearest neighbour interactions are now selected randomly , @xmath24 .",
    "each agent is updated according to the following heat bath dynamics : @xmath25^{-1}$,}\\\\ -1 & \\quad \\mbox{with $ 1-q$,}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right . \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad",
    "( 3)\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the probability of updating and @xmath27 is the inverse temperature . in this model",
    "the return is defined in terms of the logarithm of the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath28 , that is @xmath29 simulations [ 16 ] in spatial dimensions ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 indicate that the modified version of the model reproduces the required intermittent behaviour in the returns for suitable values of the coupling constant and the temperature @xmath32 ; these are listed in table 1 . in this work",
    "we investigate the persistence behaviour of the model where the local field is given by equation ( 2 ) but the nearest neighbour interactions are selected from @xmath33 . where @xmath1 is the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds .",
    "hence , we are interested in determining the fraction of traders who have been at time @xmath0 either buying or selling continuously since @xmath4",
    ". we will also suggest a possible interpretation within sociophysics of the model later on .",
    ".values of the linear dimension @xmath34 of the lattices used in the simulations .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath35 in all cases .",
    "intermittent behaviour was observed in the returns when the temperature was set at @xmath36 as given above .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as mentioned in the previous section , for each spatial dimension @xmath37 we first fine tune the temperature to reproduce intermittent behaviour in the returns .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , the temperature @xmath38 decreases with @xmath37 . for a given dimension ,",
    "all subsequent simulations are performed at that temperature .",
    "averages over at least 100 samples for each run were performed and the error - bars in the following plots are smaller than the data points .    the value of each agent at @xmath4 is noted and the dynamics updated according to equation ( 3 ) . at each time step , we count the number of agents that still persist in their initial @xmath2 state by evaluating @xmath39 initially , @xmath40 for all @xmath13 .",
    "it changes to zero when an agent changes from buying to selling or vice vera for the first time .",
    "note that once @xmath41 , it remains so for all subsequent calculations .",
    "the total number , @xmath42 , of agents who have not changed their action by time @xmath0 is then given by @xmath43 a fundamental quantity of interest is @xmath3 , the persistence probability . in this problem",
    "we can identify @xmath3 with the density of non - changing agents [ 1 ] .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total number of agents present .",
    "we now discuss our results . in figure 1",
    "we show a semi - log plot of the persistence probability against time @xmath0 for a range of bond concentrations @xmath46 for @xmath30 .",
    "its clear from the plot that the data can be fitted to @xmath47 where we estimate @xmath48 from the linear fit .     versus @xmath0 for @xmath30 over the range @xmath49 .",
    "the straight line , which is a guide to the eye , has a slope of @xmath50 . ]",
    "figure 2 displays the results for @xmath51 .",
    "although once again there is evidence for exponential decay , this time it would appear that the value of the parameter @xmath52 depends on the @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath53 we estimate @xmath54 .    .",
    "we see that here , in contrast to figure 1 for @xmath30 , the slopes are dependent on the bond concentrations .",
    "the linear fit shown is that for @xmath53 and the slope is @xmath55 . ]",
    "the results for the three - dimensional case are shown in figure 3 . here",
    "we see clear evidence of the qualitative nature of the decay depending on the bond concentration . for @xmath56",
    "we have behaviour very similar to the two cases considered earlier , namely exponential decay .",
    "however , the decay is clearly non - exponential for @xmath53 .     against @xmath0 for @xmath57 for the same bond concentrations as earlier .",
    "the straight line , which is a guide to the eye , has a slope of @xmath58 and indicates that the decay for @xmath56 is very similar to that found in lower dimensions .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath53 is clearly non - exponential . ]",
    "the results in @xmath59 are very similar to those for @xmath57 and we will not present them here . instead , in figure 4 we show a log - log plot of the persistence against time for @xmath31 .",
    "the decay of @xmath3 is seen to be heavily dependent on the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds . for low values of @xmath60 ) , we have a power - law decay at long times as given by equation ( 1 ) with an estimated value of @xmath61 . for higher value of @xmath1 the decay would appear not to be a power - law but also not exponential in its nature .     and selected bond concentrations as a log - log plot .",
    "clearly the behaviour depends crucially on the value of @xmath1 . for low ( @xmath62 ) values",
    "the decay is power - law .",
    "the straight line shown has a slope of @xmath63 . ]",
    "to conclude , we have presented the results of extensive simulations for the persistence behaviour of agents in a model capturing some of the features found in real financial markets .",
    "although the model contains bond disorder , we do not find any evidence of blocking  .",
    "the persistence behaviour appears to depend on both the spatial dimensionality and the concentration of ferromagnetic bonds . generally , whereas in low dimensions the decay is exponential , for higher dimensions and low values of @xmath1 we get power - law behaviour .",
    "the initial model was developed in an economic context .",
    "power law persistence in the case means the existence of traders who keep on buying or selling for long durations .",
    "furthermore , the presence of blocking  would be highly unrealistic for modelling the dynamics because the traders would have access to a finite amount of capital .",
    "one can also interpret the model in a social context . here",
    "the value @xmath64 or @xmath16 could represent an opinion . here",
    "blocking  would be realistic and correspond to the proportion of the population that is stubborn .",
    "hence , any model exhibiting exponential decay in the persistence probability would probably be an unrealistic model .",
    "hence , we can use the behaviour of the persistence probability a criterion to decide whether we have a realistic economic or social model .",
