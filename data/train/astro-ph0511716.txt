    "conventional statistical mechanics addresses homogeneous macroscopic systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these are traditionally treated in canonical ensembles controlled by intensive temperature @xmath1 , chemical potential @xmath2 and/or pressure @xmath3 . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the heat capacity is given by the fluctuation of the energy @xmath4 .",
    "as in astro - physics the heat capacity is often negative it is immediately clear that astro - physical systems are not in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this was often considered as a paradoxical feature of the statistics of self - gravitating systems . here",
    "we will show that this is not a mistake of equilibrium statistics when applied to self - gravitating systems but is a generic feature of statistical mechanics of any many - body systems at phase separation , independently of the range of the interactions , ref.@xcite .    as the original motivation of thermodynamics was the understanding of boiling water in steam - engines",
    ", this points to a basic misconception of conventional canonical thermo - statistics . as additional benefit of our reformulation of the basics of statistical mechanics by microcanonical statistics",
    "there is a rather simple interpretation of entropy , the characteristic entity of thermodynamics .",
    "boltzmann , ref.@xcite , defined the entropy of an isolated system in terms of the sum of all possible configurations , @xmath5 , which the system can assume consistent with its constraints of given energy , volume , and further conserved constraints:@xmath6as written on boltzmann s tomb - stone , with @xmath7 in semi - classical approximation .",
    "@xmath8 is the total energy , @xmath9 is the number of particles and @xmath10 the volume . or , more appropriate for a finite quantum - mechanical system : @xmath11\\label{quantums }",
    "= \\sum{\\scriptscriptstyle\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{all eigenstates",
    "n of h with given n,$v$,}\\\\\\mbox{and } e < e_n\\le e+\\epsilon_0\\nonumber \\end{array}}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 the macroscopic energy resolution .",
    "this is still up to day the deepest , most fundamental , and most simple definition of entropy .",
    "_ there is no need of the thermodynamic limit , no need of concavity , extensivity , and homogeneity_. schrdinger was wrong saying that microcanonical statistics is only good for diluted systems , ref.@xcite .",
    "it may very well also address the solid - liquid transition ref.@xcite and even self - gravitating systems as we will demonstrate in this article . in its semi - classical approximation , eq.([boltzmann ] ) , @xmath13 simply measures the area of the sub - manifold of points in the @xmath14-dimensional phase - space ( @xmath15-space ) with prescribed energy @xmath8 , particle number @xmath9 , volume @xmath10 , and some other time invariant constraints which are here suppressed for simplicity . because it was planck who coined it in this mathematical form ,",
    "i will call it the boltzmann - planck principle .",
    "the boltzmann - planck formula has a simple but deep physical interpretation : @xmath5 or @xmath16 measure our ignorance about the complete set of initial values for all @xmath14 microscopic degrees of freedom which are needed to specify the @xmath9-body system unambiguously , ref.@xcite . to have complete knowledge of the system we would need to know [ within its semiclassical approximation ( [ boltzmann ] ) ] the initial positions and velocities of all @xmath9 particles in the system , which means we would need to know a total of @xmath14 values",
    ". then @xmath5 would be equal to one and the entropy , @xmath16 , would be zero . however , we usually only know the value of a few parameters that are conserved or change slowly with time , such as the energy , number of particles , volume and so on .",
    "we generally know very little about the positions and velocities of the particles .",
    "the manifold of all these points in the @xmath14-dim .",
    "phase space , consistent with the given conserved macroscopic constraints of @xmath17 , is the microcanonical ensemble , which has a well - defined geometrical size @xmath5 and , by equation ( [ boltzmann0 ] ) , a non - vanishing entropy , @xmath18 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath18 on its arguments determines completely thermostatics and equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "clearly , hamiltonian ( liouvillean ) dynamics of the system can not create the missing information about the initial values - i.e. the entropy @xmath18 can not decrease .",
    "as has been further worked out in ref.@xcite and more recently in ref.@xcite the inherent finite resolution of the macroscopic description implies an increase of @xmath5 or @xmath16 with time when an external constraint is relaxed , c.f.chapter [ second ] . such is a statement of the second law of thermodynamics , ref.@xcite , which requires that the _ internal _ production of entropy be positive or zero for every spontaneous process .",
    "analysis of the consequences of the second law by the microcanonical ensemble is appropriate because , in an isolated system ( which is the one relevant for the microcanonical ensemble ) , the changes in total entropy must represent the _ internal _ production of entropy , see above , and there are no additional uncontrolled fluctuating energy exchanges with the environment .",
    "the weight @xmath19 of configurations with energy e in the definition of the canonical partition sum @xmath20 becomes here _ bimodal _ , at the transition temperature it has two peaks , the liquid and the gas configurations which are separated in energy by the latent heat .",
    "consequently @xmath0 must be convex ( like @xmath21 ) and the weight in ( [ canonicweight ] ) has a minimum between the two pure phases .",
    "of course , the minimum can only be seen in the microcanonical ensemble where the energy is controlled and its fluctuations forbidden .",
    "otherwise , the system would fluctuate between the two pure phases ( inter - phase fluctuation ) by an , for macroscopic systems even macroscopic , energy @xmath22 of the order of the latent heat .",
    "i.e. _ the convexity of @xmath0 is the generic signal of a phase transition of first order and of phase - separation , ref.@xcite_. this applies also to macroscopic systems coupled by short or long - range interactions .",
    "of course , even there phase - separation exists and there is a minimum ( convexity ) in @xmath0 and , consequently , negative heat capacity@xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized : in conventional canonical statistics phase - separated systems are treated by artificial constructions of two coexisting simple configurations of each phase like a single drop with vapor around ( wulff - construction ) .",
    "but this is not a common ensemble of various droplets with its inter - phase fluctuations leading e.g. to a negative heat capacity .",
    "such macroscopic energy fluctuations and the resulting negative heat capacity are already early discussed in high - energy physics by carlitz , ref.@xcite .",
    "classical boltzmann - planck microcanonical statistics applies very well to the equilibrium of self - gravitating systems provided we put the system into a box ( ignoring slow evaporation ) and use a hard core in the interaction at short distances where anyhow non - gravitational physics like hydrogen burning dominates gravity .",
    "padmanabhan in his stimulating review ref.@xcite discussed this point in detail .",
    "we simplify the original many - body problem by the mean - field approximation , details in ref@xcite . here",
    "the ( certainly also important ) many - body correlations are ignored .",
    "the entropy is then a function of the one - body densities @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is maximized and a closed equation for the optimal one - body density distributions obtained . to get this result and to get finite @xmath23",
    "the short - distance cut - off and a hard core in the two - body interaction @xmath25 is essential .",
    "the resulting mean - field theory therefore does _ not _ lead to an isothermal sphere .",
    "the latter is a solution of poisson s equation ( ref.@xcite ) with a strict @xmath26 interaction .    moreover , for equilibrium one does not need any exotic q - deformed statistics , ref.@xcite .",
    "the error of ref.@xcite is the use of a generalized variant of boltzmann - gibbs _ canonical _ ensemble instead of the basic microcanonical one , a point on which tsallis seems to agree in his discussion in ref.@xcite , see also ref.@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ cover ] we show the equilibrium distributions of self - gravitating systems under large angular - momentum in the mean - field approximation :    the necessity of using `` extensive '' instead of `` intensive '' control parameters is explicit in astrophysical problems .",
    "e.g. : for the description of rotating stars one conventionally works at a given temperature and fixed angular velocity @xmath27 c.f .",
    "of course in reality there is neither a heat bath nor a rotating disk .",
    "moreover , the latter scenario is fundamentally wrong as at the periphery of the disk the rotational velocity may even become larger than velocity of light .",
    "non - extensive systems like astro - physical ones do not allow a `` field - theoretical '' description controlled by intensive fields !",
    "e.g. configurations with a maximum of random energy on a rotating disk , i.e. at fixed rotational velocity @xmath27 ( which is intensive ) : @xmath28 and consequently with the largest entropy are the ones with smallest moment of inertia @xmath29 , compact single stars .",
    "just the opposite happens when the angular - momentum @xmath30 ( extensive ) and not the angular velocity @xmath27 is fixed:@xmath31then configurations with large moment of inertia are maximizing the phase space and the entropy .",
    "i.e. eventually double or multi stars are produced , as observed in reality .    in figure [ phased ]",
    "one clearly sees the rich and realistic microcanonical phase - diagram of a rotating gravitating system controlled by the conserved `` extensive '' parameters energy and angular - momentum , ref.@xcite .",
    "also the second law becomes significantly more transparent within microcanonical statistics :    many formulations of the second law exist .",
    "the understanding of entropy is sometimes obscured by frequent use of the boltzmann - gibbs canonical ensemble , and thermodynamic limit ; and the relationship of entropy to the second law is often beset with confusion between external transfers of entropy and its internal production .",
    "perhaps the clearest statement is by prigogine , ref.@xcite : he distinguishes between internal and external entropy transfer .",
    "whereas the transfer @xmath32 to an external heat bath can be positive , negative , or zero , the internal generation of entropy @xmath33 within the system is necessarily @xmath34 .",
    "this is the sharpest formulation of the second law .",
    "@xmath33 is best seen in the microcanonical ensemble , as there are no couplings to any heat bath and no sometimes uncontrolled exchanges of energy with it .",
    "the second law is then most rigorously given by equation ( [ secondlaw ] ) : @xmath35    a geometric visualization how an equilibrium distribution in the @xmath14-dim phase space expands into a ( fat)-fractal ( gibbs ink lines ) after a constraint , here the wall between the phase - space volumes between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is suddenly released is given by figure ( [ box ] ) .",
    "the liouville theorem tells us that the ( riemannian- ) size of it as given by eq.([boltzmann ] ) does not change . keeping in mind that due to the redundant information about the system ( c.f .",
    "chapter [ entropy ] ) it is in general impossible to distinguish a point inside the fractal from a neighboring point outside .",
    "therefore the proper way to `` measure '' the size of the manifold is by its box - counting `` measure '' .",
    "i.e. the phase - space integrals in eq.([boltzmann ] ) or eq.([quantums ] ) have to be calculated by the _ box - counting volume _ @xmath38 as is explained in fig.([box ] ) ( details in refs.@xcite ) : @xmath39:=\\underbar{$\\lim$}_{\\delta\\to 0 } \\delta^{6n } n_\\delta[{\\bf{m}}(e , n , t\\gg t_0)]\\label{boxvol}\\ ] ] which is @xmath40 $ ] . that is the second law .",
    "the story of applying microcanonical statistics to self - gravitating systems and eventually to cosmology is far open .",
    "there are many questions to answer , e.g. :    there is the problem of statistics in an expanding universe as discussed by padmanabhan ref.@xcite , the question of defining boltzmann - planck statistics in general relativity and connected the problem of avoiding field - theoretical descriptions with intensive statistical control - parameters or using them despite the fact that first order transitions demand extensive control parameters as discussed here .",
    "the present author , coming from far away from nuclear and statistical physics , is open for any helpful suggestion .",
    "an interdisciplinary meeting like this nbs2005 is here very important .",
    "i like to thank francoise combes and raoul robert for this great opportunity .",
    "conventional canonical statistics is insufficient to handle the original goal of thermodynamics , phase separations with their characteristic inter - phase fluctuations . here",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is much richer and leads to _ negative specific heat_. this is thus _ not _ a characteristics of self - gravitating systems .",
    "phase transitions can be found _ without the thermodynamic limit , without homogeneity , concavity , and extensivity_. microcanonical statistics opens to a much wider class of applications as e.g. astrophysical systems .",
    "moreover it gives a simple formulation and proof of the second law .",
