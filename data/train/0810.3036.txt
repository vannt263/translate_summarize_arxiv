    "the wave function of a three - particle system is very complicated .",
    "it may have several different kinds of asymptotic behavior reflecting the possible asymptotic fragmentations .",
    "it is very hard to impose all the asymptotic conditions on a single wave function .",
    "the faddeev approach is a simplification : the wave function is split into components such that each component describes only one kind of asymptotic fragmentation @xcite .",
    "then only one kind of asymptotic behavior should be imposed on each component .",
    "the components satisfy a set of coupled equations , the faddeev equations .",
    "if we want to apply this idea to systems with coulomb potentials , we may run into difficulties .",
    "the coulomb potential is a long range potential , thus the motion in a coulomb field never becomes a free motion , even at asymptotic distances .",
    "consequently the separation of the wave function along different asymptotic properties does not really work .",
    "if we just plug the coulomb potential into the original faddeev equations , the equations become singular .",
    "the usual asymptotic analysis fails to provide the boundary condition . in integral equation form",
    ", the kernel of the equations fails to be compact and we can not approximate them by finite - rank terms .",
    "merkuriev proposed @xcite a modification of the faddeev procedure which led to integral equations with compact kernels and differential equations with known boundary conditions .",
    "resonances are related to the outgoing - wave solutions of the schrdinger equation at complex energies @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath3 is the resonance energy and @xmath4 is the resonance width , which is related to the lifetime of the decaying state . in an integral equation formalism , the resonances are the solutions of the homogeneous integral equations on the unphysical sheet , close to real energies .",
    "a few years ago , a method for solving faddeev - type integral equations for scattering problems @xcite was adopted to calculate resonances @xcite . the homogeneous version of the faddeev integral equations was solved at complex energies on the unphysical sheet .",
    "the method entails expanding the potentials terms in the integral equations on a coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "this transforms the integral equations to a matrix equation .",
    "@xmath5-wave resonances of the @xmath0 system have been calculated and good agreement with the results of methods based on complex rotation of the coordinates were found @xcite .",
    "an accumulation of resonance poles around thresholds has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , we are not investigating these threshold resonances here .",
    "they are either too close to the threshold , too close to each other , or too broad as we move away from the threshold . in any case ,",
    "their experimental verification does not seem to be likely in the near future .    in this paper , we will report some new developments of this method . in sec .  2",
    ", we will outline the faddeev - merkuriev approach to the three - body coulomb problem . in sec .  3",

    "4 we present resonances of the @xmath0 three - body system up to the fifth threshold with total angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "we provide results for both natural and unnatural parity states .",

    ", we use the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the distance between the pair @xmath12 and @xmath11 is the distance between the center of mass of the pair @xmath12 and the particle @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath8 , the interaction of the pair @xmath12 , appears as @xmath14 . in an atomic three - body system",
    ", two particles always have the same sign of charge .",
    "so , without loss of generality , we can assume that they are particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and therefore @xmath17 is a repulsive coulomb potential .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is defined in the three - body hilbert space .",
    "therefore , the two - body potential operators are formally embedded in the three - body hilbert space , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a unit operator in the two - body hilbert space associated with the @xmath11 coordinate .",
    "the role of a coulomb potential in a three - body system is twofold .",
    "the coulomb potential is a long range potential but it also possesses some features of a short - range potential .",
    "it strongly correlates the particles and may even support two - body bound states .",
    "these two properties are contradictory and require different treatment .",
    "merkuriev proposed a separation of the three - body configuration space into different asymptotic regions @xcite .",

    "it was shown that in @xmath25 the short - range character of the coulomb potential prevails , while in the complementary region the long - range character of the coulomb potential becomes dominant .",

    "consequently , there are no two - body channels associated with this fragmentation and the entire @xmath43 can be considered as long - range potential .",
    "then the long - range hamiltonian is defined as @xmath44 and the three - body hamiltonian takes the form @xmath45 this hamiltonian looks like an ordinary three - body hamiltonian with two short range interactions .    to determine the bound and resonant states",
    ", we have to solve the schrdinger equation @xmath46 for real and complex @xmath47 eigenvalues , respectively . in the faddeev approach",
    "the faddeev components are defined by @xmath48 .",
    "this involves a splitting of the wave function into two components @xmath49 where @xmath50 by adding these two equations and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ psi12 ] ) we recover the original schrdinger equation .",
    "so , the faddeev procedure is no more and no less than a method of solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "we can cast these differential equations into an integral equation form @xmath51 where @xmath52 .    before going further",
    ", we should examine the spectral properties of the hamiltonian @xmath53 it is obvious that it supports infinitely many two - body channels associated with the bound states of the attractive coulomb potential @xmath54 .",
    "potential @xmath43 is repulsive , therefore does not support bound states and there are no two - body channels associated with fragmentation @xmath55 .",
    "the three - body potential @xmath56 is attractive .",
    "it is a valley along a parabola - like curve which becomes shallower and shallower , and finally disappears as @xmath57 goes to infinity ( see fig .",
    "thus , @xmath58 does not support two - body bound states either in the subsystem @xmath59 if @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , there are no two - body channels associated with fragmentation @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath61 has two - body channels only in the fragmentation where particle @xmath15 is at infinity and particles @xmath16 and @xmath55 form bound states .",

    "a similar analysis is valid also for @xmath64 .",
    "so , the merkuriev procedure results in a separation of the three - body wave function into components in such a way that each component has only one type of two - body channel .",
    "this is the main advantage of the original faddeev equations and , as the above analysis shows , this property remains valid also for attractive coulomb potentials .",
    "the long - range part of the coulomb potential , @xmath65 , does not support two - body channels .",
    "it may , however , support bound states , i.e.  @xmath66 may have three - body bound states .",
    "this can lead to the appearance of spurious solutions of the faddeev - merkuriev equations . if @xmath66 has a bound state , then @xmath67 is singular at this energy . consequently , in eq .",
    "( [ psidef ] ) , applying this singular operator on a vanishing @xmath68 may produce a non - vanishing @xmath69 .",
    "so , we may find a solution where neither @xmath70 nor @xmath71 vanish , but @xmath72 vanishes .",
    "these states would be non - trivial solutions of the faddeev - merkuriev equations , but would be trivial solutions of the original schrdinger equation .",
    "these states are spurious , or ghost , solutions .",
    "a way to eliminate them is to ensure that in the energy range of physical interest @xmath66 does not have bound states .",
    "we can achieve this by choosing the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 accordingly . for resonances at higher energies we should take a bigger @xmath73 , thus pushing the unwanted bound states of @xmath66 out of the spectrum of physical interest .",
    "it is also obvious from this analysis that the spurious solutions are sensitive to the choice of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the true resonances are not . by varying the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74",

    "building this information into the formalism , we arrive at the integral equation @xmath80 .",
    "we notice that so far no approximation has been made , and even though this integral equation has only one component , it gives a full account of the asymptotic and symmetry properties of the system .",
    "the coulomb  sturmian ( cs ) functions @xcite are the solutions of the sturm ",

    "the completeness relation takes the form ( with angular momentum summation implicitly included ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
