    "the newer bosonic counterpart of so - coupled systems using ultracold atoms have no analog in solid - state systems and are thus expected to exhibit genuinely new physics .",

    "specifically , mean - field theory predicts a superposition of condensates of opposite momenta with their relative amplitudes and phases unspecified .    in this work",
    "we show how fluctuations remove this accidental degeneracy and select a unique ground state ( up to overall symmetries ) through the mechanism of ` order by disorder ' @xcite .",
    "although the phenomenon of order by disorder has been theoretically accepted and discussed within the context of classical spin models @xcite , quantum magnetism @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite , experimental demonstrations are , at best , scarce @xcite .",

    "noting this , in the right panel we plot the average of the spin and density modes for each value of @xmath35 .",
    "one sees that the average is always lowest in energy for @xmath72 .",
    "this indicates that the zero - point fluctuations from the goldstone modes will select @xmath72 state though things become more subtle for @xmath73 .",
    "such a state , as can be seen from eq .",

    "otherwise the density and spin mode have respectively linear and quadratic dispersions about their minima .",
    "it is interesting to compare these to the noninteracting energies shown in fig .  [",

    "let us now consider the free energy due to quantum and thermal fluctuations described by @xmath45 .",
    "it is useful to separate out the contribution from zero - point fluctuations and write @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 is inverse temperature .",
    "reminiscent of the zero - point photon contribution to the casimir - polder force @xcite , the purely quantum contribution @xmath85 written as it is diverges .",
    "this divergence can be regularized by subtracting the free energy for a particular mean - field configuration which we take to have @xmath72 : @xmath86 .",
    "this regularized expression converges ,- summation is performed , the summand has the asymptotic form proportional to @xmath87 for large @xmath57 as can be determined perturbatively ] and no renormalization of the effective range of interactions is needed . the zero - point contribution to the free energy numerically computed as a function of @xmath35",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combine](a ) where the summation is performed over 26 bands ( we emphasize that in order to obtain quantitatively correct results , including only the gapless modes is insufficient )",
    ". one sees , indeed , that the @xmath72 state has the lowest energy and at @xmath88 such a state is unambiguously selected .",
    "we now turn to the finite - temperature contribution to the free energy .",
    "interestingly , one finds that the sign of the thermal contribution @xmath89 is negative and opposite to that of @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the thermal contribution is always smaller than the contribution from zero - point fluctuations , in contrast to typical situations where thermal fluctuations enhance the degeneracy lifting and are larger in magnitude for modest temperatures ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another instance of where quantum and thermal fluctuations select different states is in ref .",
    "the sign of @xmath91 at low @xmath92 can be understood by noting that the spin mode has the lowest energy for @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ) .     as a function of @xmath35 for three different values of @xmath94 .",
    "( b ) the absolute value of the ( negative ) thermal free energy splitting between the @xmath72 and @xmath93 configurations @xmath95 as a function of temperature ( solid line ) .",
    "this is seen to approach the quantum zero - point splitting @xmath96 at high temperatures ( dashed line ) . in both panels",
    "the solid lines are fits to the numerically computed data points .",
    ", width=326 ]    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : combine](b ) , the magnitude of @xmath97 approaches @xmath98 at high @xmath92 , so that @xmath99 in this limit .",
    "this behavior can be understood through a high @xmath92 expansion of the free energy @xmath100 as the second term cancels the quantum contribution , we focus on the larger first term which can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the eigenvalues of @xmath55 and we have used @xmath103 .",
    "the second summation above is over the reduced brillouin zone @xmath104 which is restricted to positive values of @xmath105 . the eigenvalues @xmath102 are independent of the condensate configuration given by @xmath35 .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath55 can be removed through the unitary transformation @xmath106 where @xmath107.-dependence into @xmath108 and so the eigenvalues of @xmath109 generally depend on @xmath35 , which determine the bogliubov spectrum . ]",
    "thus to this order we find that @xmath110 .",
    "the next - order term in the high - temperature expansion has @xmath111 dependence which is evident in the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combine](b ) .",
    "having established using the bogoliubov expansion that fluctuations select @xmath72 , we now investigate the self - consistency of this approach .",
    "this is determined by the depletion or the number of particles excited out of the condensate @xmath112 considered as a fraction of the total particle number @xmath14 .",
    "consistency of course requires that this be finite , while neglecting of terms beyond quadratic order in @xmath113 is quantitatively reliable only if @xmath114 .",
    "the quantum and thermal contributions to @xmath115 are , respectively , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the bose - einstein distribution function . the only possible divergences of these expressions are in the infrared , and so can be studied analytically using the small-@xmath119 expansion .    in 3d at @xmath120",
    ", @xmath121 is finite and so can be sufficiently small provided weak - enough interactions . our numerical results in fact demonstrate that the depletion is small even for moderately strong interactions , including in the region of experimental relevance . for @xmath73 , the thermal contribution is instead found to have a logarithmic divergence in 3d .",
    "this divergence ( similar to that occurring in quasi-2d scalar condensates ) is naturally removed for finite - sized systems and the condensate will thereby satisfy the stability criterion . for 2d condensates with isotropic so coupling",
    ", the situation is different . here",
    ", the quantum depletion again converges , but the thermal depletion diverges as @xmath122 for small @xmath119 .",
    "thus , at @xmath73 our theory is unstable in 2d , which is consistent with work suggesting fragmentation @xcite .",
    "our conclusions on the stability of the condensate are , remarkably , identical to those based on the simple application of the einstein criterion to the noninteracting spectrum .",
    "this is particularly surprising since the low-@xmath119 region is strongly modified by the interactions , giving quasiparticle modes that disperse with different powers than in the noninteracting case .",
    "we now comment on the experimental feasibility of observing order by disorder in rbec .",
    "we first consider the magnitude of the degeneracy lifting . as a prototypical example",
    "we take spin one @xmath123rb . for a typical density of @xmath124 and @xmath63 ,",
    "we find ( for the appropriate scattering lengths ) that at zero temperature the free energy splitting per particle due to fluctuations is @xmath125 .",
    "one should note that this number should not be directly compared with the condensate temperature since the _ total _ energy determines the ground state .",
    "it is this energy which will determine experimental timescales for the relaxation to the ground state .",
    "spin - one atoms also possess a spin - dependent interaction term which we have neglected .",
    "for @xmath123rb , however , this spin - dependent interaction is relatively small ( .5% that of the spin - independent ) and as a result the degeneracy lifting from fluctuations is typically larger .",
    "alternatively , one could use fermionic homonuclear molecules that have a singlet ground state .",
    "more importantly , schemes to create so coupling in bosonic systems typically rely on utilizing dressed states @xcite which can induce anisotropic interactions . the magnitude of such terms and their effect on the order - by - disorder mechanism will be left to future work when it becomes clear which of the several proposed schemes is most promising to realize rashba coupling .",
    "another entity of experimental relevance is the harmonic confining potential .",
    "the results of the current manuscript will hold if the conditions for the local density approximation ( lda ) are satisfied @xcite . for our system",
    "this requires that the energy splitting of the single - particle states as recently found in in @xcite be small compared to the interaction energy .",
    "this energy splitting becomes small for weak trapping and/or strong so coupling , resulting in a large quasi - degenerate manifold of single - particle states .",
    "conversely , in the weakly interacting limit ( where lda is inapplicable ) recent work @xcite has shown the ground states of the rbec system in a trap can form vortex lattices .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the system of rashba so - coupled bosons with isotropic interactions ( rbec ) . in general bosons with so coupling offer a genuinely new class of systems which has not been addressed in the vast solid state literature on spintronics @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have established that fluctuations select the rbec system to condense into a single momentum state .",
    "we have argued that such a configuration is stable in 3d but destabilized when @xmath73 in 2d .",
    "we expect bosons with rashba so coupling to be realized in the near future for which the predicted configuration will be observable in stern - gerlach experiments . in future studies",
    "it will be interesting to investigate more general combinations of rashba and dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "such systems also possess accidental mean - field degeneracies and thus fluctuations are expected to play an important role in determining their ground states .",
    "in addition it will be interesting to investigate rbec systems in two dimensions .",
