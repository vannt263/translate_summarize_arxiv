    "during last three decades , the studies of matrix models of theoretical physics have deeply influenced a number of branches of modern mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "the central notion here is the partition function @xmath8 given by the integral over the set @xmath9 of all hermitian @xmath10-dimensional matrices @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a `` potential '' function , @xmath14 is the lebesgue measure , is the normalizing constant , and @xmath15 denotes the mathematical expectation with respect to the probability measure @xmath16 with the density @xmath17 the measure @xmath16 supported on @xmath9 generates the gaussian unitary invariant ensemble of random matrices abbreviated by gue ( see monograph @xcite for the detailed description of the ensemble and its properties ) .",
    "the first non - trivial example of ( 1.1 ) is given by the quartic potential @xmath18 the matrix model ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.3 ) has served as the source of a series of deep results establishing connections between orthogonal polynomials , integrable systems , moduli spaces of curves and such combinatorial structures as maps ( see @xcite and @xcite for the earlier and more recent results and references and @xcite for the review ) .",
    "one of the simplest but important result is that the leading term of the formal asymptotic expansion of variable @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 is given by the series in powers of @xmath21 with the coefficients determined by the numbers of @xmath22-valent two - vertex maps dual to the famous quadrangulations of the compact riemann manifold ( see @xcite for introductory description and references therein ) .    it should be noted that the gue and its real symmetric and symplectic analogs represent very special class of random matrices .",
    "it is natural to ask about matrix models when the mathematical expectation in ( 1.4 ) is taken with respect to a measure different from that determined by gue .    in present paper",
    "we introduce a discrete analog of ( 1.1 ) , where the integration over @xmath9 is replaced by the sum over the set @xmath0 of all possible simple graphs @xmath23 with @xmath1 vertices . in this setting the `` kinetic energy '' term @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the discrete analog of the laplace operator determined on the graph @xmath23 .",
    "corresponding gibbs weight @xmath27 generates the probability measure @xmath28 on @xmath0 .    a simple but non - trivial property of this ensemble plays a very important role in what follows .",
    "the observation is that the probability space @xmath29 coincides with the widely known erds - rnyi ensemble of random graphs with @xmath1 vertices ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this ensemble ,",
    "the indicator functions of edges are represented by jointly independent bernoulli random variables . as far as we know , this connection between erds - rnyi random graphs and the gibbs measure @xmath30 was not observed before .",
    "our aim is to consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given by the analog of quartic potential ( 1.3 ) and to explore the combinatorial structures that arise in this problem .",
    "we develop a diagram technique to study the cumulant expansion of @xmath33 .",
    "we show that the leading terms of this expansion are related with the number of connected diagrams on the set of two - valent vertices .",
    "we derive recurrent relations for the numbers of such diagrams and describe the coefficients of the cumulant expansions of @xmath33 in two different asymptotic regimes when @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "these recurrent relations generalise those for the catalan numbers .",
    "corresponding generating function verifies an equation similar to the plya equation for the generating function of the rooted cayley trees .",
    "given a finite graph with the set @xmath37 of labelled vertices and @xmath38 the set of simple non - oriented edges , the discrete analog of the laplace operator @xmath39 on graph @xmath40 can be determined as ( see for example , @xcite ) by relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the difference operator determined on the space of complex functions on vertices @xmath43 and @xmath44 is its conjugate determined on the space of complex functions on edges @xmath45 .",
    "it can be easily shown that in the canonical basis , the linear operator @xmath46 has @xmath47 matrix with the elements @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the vertex degree .",
    "if one considers the @xmath47 adjacency matrix @xmath50 of the graph @xmath40 , @xmath51 then one can rewrite the definition of @xmath52 ( 2.2 ) in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the kronecker symbol @xmath55 it follows from ( 2.1 ) that @xmath56 has positive eigenvalues .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath0 of all possible simple non - oriented graphs @xmath2 with the set @xmath57 of @xmath1 labelled vertices .",
    "obviously , @xmath58 .",
    "given an element @xmath59 , it is natural to consider the trace @xmath60 as the total energy of the graph @xmath61 .",
    "then we can assign to each graph @xmath23 the gibbs weight @xmath62 , @xmath63 and introduce the partition function @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath13 is an application @xmath66 that we specify later . using the fact that @xmath67 , one can consider ( 2.5 ) as a discrete analog of the partition function ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we will see that this is especially interesting in the case of quartic potential ( 1.3 ) .",
    "let us note that we should normalize the sum ( 2.5 ) by @xmath68 , but this does not play any role with respect to our results . in what follows ,",
    "we omit subscript @xmath1 in @xmath69 .    definition ( 2.4 ) implies that @xmath70 then we can rewrite ( 2.5 ) in the form @xmath71 it is easy to see that @xmath72 then the normalized partition function can be represented as @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the mathematical expectation with respect to the measure supported on the set @xmath0 .",
    "this measure assigns to each element @xmath75 the probability @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the set of edges of the graph @xmath61 .",
    "given a couple @xmath78 , @xmath79 , one can determine a random variable @xmath80 on the probability space @xmath81 that is the indicator function of the edge @xmath82 @xmath83 it is easy to show that the random variables @xmath84 are jointly independent and are of the same bernoulli distribution depending on @xmath85 such that @xmath86    the probability space @xmath87 is known as the erds - rnyi ( or bernoulli ) ensemble of random graphs with the edge probability @xmath88 . since the series of pioneering papers by erds and rnyi , the asymptotic properties of graphs @xmath87 , such as the size and the number of connected components , the maximal and minimal vertex degree and many others , are extensively studied ( see @xcite ) .",
    "spectral properties of corresponding random matrices @xmath89 ( 2.3 ) and @xmath52 ( 2.4 ) are considered in a series of papers ( in particular , see @xcite ) . in present paper",
    "we study the random graph ensemble @xmath87 from another point of view motivated by the asymptotic behavior of partition functions ( 2.9 ) with certain `` potentials '' @xmath13 .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the gibbs weight @xmath90 generates the probability measure on graphs equivalent to that determined by the erds - rnyi ensemble of random graphs .",
    "this gives us an important tool for direct computation of averages of the form ( 2.9 ) .",
    "another important point is that this gibbs weight leads us to the correct definition of discrete analogs of the matrix models ( 1.1 ) and in particular of the matrix models with quartic potentials ( 1.4 ) .",
    "that is why one can not neglect the laplacian form of the gibbs measure and start simply with computations of averages with respect to @xmath91 .",
    "let us determine the discrete analog of the partition function ( 1.1 ) with quartic potential ( 1.3 ) .",
    "once @xmath24 replaced by @xmath92 , it is natural to consider @xmath93 as the analog of @xmath94 .",
    "then the partition function ( 2.5 ) reads as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is to be specified .",
    "it follows from ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) that @xmath97 then , using ( 2.6 ) and repeating computations of ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) , we obtain representation @xmath98 in this relation , we have denoted @xmath99 and introduced the random variable @xmath100 where @xmath101 are jointly independent random variables of the law ( 2.10 ) with @xmath102 replaced by @xmath103 . the average @xmath104 denotes the corresponding mathematical expectation . in what follows ,",
    "we omit the subscripts @xmath85 and @xmath103 when they are not necessary .",
    "we study the limiting behavior of the cumulants of the random variable @xmath105 in two different asymptotic regimes .",
    "the first limiting transition is determined by the choice @xmath106 as @xmath7 .",
    "we study this case in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we consider the second asymptotic regime given by of @xmath107 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath108 are bounded by @xmath109 and @xmath110 ,",
    "we can write that @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the @xmath113-th cumulant of random variable @xmath105 . @xmath114 denoting by @xmath115 the random variable @xmath116 with triplet @xmath117 , we can write that @xmath118 where the sum runs over all possible values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 the variable @xmath121 is also known in probability theory as the semi - invariant of @xmath113 random variables @xmath122 .",
    "let us introduce a graphical representation of the set of variables @xmath122 .",
    "given @xmath113 values @xmath123 , we represent the set of random variables @xmath124 by the set of @xmath113 labelled vertices @xmath125 . regarding two variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 , we join corresponding vertices @xmath128 and @xmath129 by an edge @xmath130 if and only if @xmath126 and @xmath127 have at least one variable @xmath131 in common . considering all possible couples @xmath132 and drawing corresponding edges",
    ", we obtain a graph that we denote by @xmath133 .",
    "it is clear that this graph @xmath134 depends on particular value of the variable @xmath135 .",
    "the following proposition is a well - known fact from the probability theory of random fields @xcite .",
    "v v let us first note that if two random variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 have no variables @xmath131 in common , then they are independent . clearly , the same observation is true for the subfamilies of random variables @xmath122 .",
    "this means that if the graph @xmath136 consists of two or more non - connected components , then the corresponding subsets of random variables @xmath122 are jointly independent .",
    "the characteristic property of the semiinvariants is that it vanishes in this case @xcite .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma 3.1 .",
    "et us note that the fact that @xmath126 and @xmath127 have one or more variables @xmath131 in common means that corresponding variables @xmath137 coincide .",
    "in particular , the fact that @xmath126 and @xmath127 have exactly one variable @xmath131 in common implies that one of the eight possibilities for the sets @xmath138 and @xmath139 occurs .",
    "for example , this happens when @xmath140 we will refer to such cases as to the direct and inverse gluing , respectively .",
    "v @xmath141 v v    to draw an edge @xmath130 of the graph @xmath142 means to make equal at least two variables @xmath131 taken from @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . to make equal two or more @xmath131 s means to make equal some of the variables @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "let us describe the process of drawing edges of @xmath142 step by step .",
    "one starts with @xmath143 variables @xmath144 that can take values @xmath145 independently .",
    "each gluing of two variables @xmath131 diminishes by @xmath146 the number of variables that move independently . to make the graph connected",
    ", we have to draw at least @xmath147 edges , so we are forced to perform at least @xmath147 gluings .",
    "when this is done , the number of variables that move independently is less or equal to @xmath148 . maximizing the number of variables that can take different values , from @xmath109 to @xmath1 independently , we obtain @xmath149 terms .",
    "lemma 3.2 is proved .",
    "let us further develop the graphical representation of the set of variables @xmath122 and give more details for the description of corresponding connected graphs @xmath150 . at this stage",
    "we make no difference between the direct and inverse gluings ( 3.8 ) .",
    "first let us note that each variable @xmath115 by itself can be represented by a graph of three vertices corresponding to variables @xmath151 and @xmath152 joined by two edges denoting random variables @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively . slightly modifying this",
    ", we can say that @xmath126 is represented by a vertex @xmath128 with two off - spreads representing variables @xmath155 to the left and @xmath156 to the right from @xmath128 .",
    "we say that the vertices @xmath128 are two - valent . in @xmath150 , there are @xmath113 such two - valent vertices joined by @xmath147 edges that we refer now to as to arcs .",
    "the arcs join two different off - spreads that we glue during the procedure described in the proof of the lemma 3.2 .",
    "the family of @xmath113 two - valent vertices together with @xmath147 arcs represent _ a diagram _ that we denote by @xmath157 .",
    "this diagram provides more information than the graph @xmath150 because it shows exactly which off - spreads are glued between themselves .",
    "if one forgets the two - valent structure of @xmath128 s , one gets the tree @xmath150 .",
    "one of the possible example of @xmath157 and corresponding @xmath150 for @xmath158 is given on figure 1 .",
    "one can see that several off - spreads can be glued together . in this case",
    "we say that they are colored by the same color .",
    "we call the off - spreads that remain non - glued as the free off - spreads and leave them non - colored ( or grey ) . on figure 1 the diagram @xmath159 contains three grey elements and three color groups of @xmath146 , @xmath146 , and @xmath160 elements",
    ".    clearly , one can draw several diagrams that represent the same coloring of the off - spreads .",
    "an example of such two diagrams @xmath161 and @xmath162 with @xmath158 is given on figure 2 .",
    "we call the diagram _ the reduced diagram _ when the off - spreads of the same color are joined by the arcs connecting the nearest neighbors . on figure 2 the diagram @xmath157 is the reduced one , the diagram @xmath163 is not .",
    "this argument explains the difference between the diagrams we have and the set of trees on labelled vertices .",
    "indeed , the diagrams @xmath157 and @xmath163 are equivalent but the corresponding trees are not .    with this diagram representation",
    ", we see that the leading contribution to ( 3.9 ) comes from the family @xmath164 of connected acyclic reduced diagrams @xmath157 drawn on the set of @xmath113 two - valent vertices with ordered off - spreads .",
    "the number of such diagrams @xmath165 is determined in the next section .",
    "we complete this section with the following simple proposition .",
    "* lemma 3.3 . *",
    "_ let us consider a connected reduced diagram @xmath157 that have @xmath166 color groups of arcs , with @xmath167 arcs in each color group .",
    "then @xmath168 there are @xmath169 grey elements in @xmath161 . _    _ proof .",
    "_ each diagram generates a tree on @xmath113 vertices @xmath170 .",
    "so the total number of arcs is equal to @xmath147 .",
    "the group of @xmath171 arcs of the same color produces @xmath172 color elements .",
    "the total number of colored elements is @xmath173 .",
    "then the number of non - colored ( grey ) elements in @xmath157 is @xmath174 .",
    "in present section we study the case when the `` temperature '' @xmath175 vanishes when @xmath176 @xmath177 with some @xmath178 .",
    "this corresponds to the random graph ensemble ( 3.2 ) with vanishing edge probability @xmath179 where we denoted @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in this paper",
    "we consider the limiting transition when @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the case of @xmath184 will be studied in separate publication .",
    "the main results of this section are presented by the following two statements .    v    .",
    "v    let us consider the auxiliary numbers @xmath185 it is easy to deduce from ( 4.3 ) that the sequence @xmath186 can be determined by the following recurrent relation @xmath187",
    "@xmath188 v    using ( 4.4 ) , it is easy to find the first values of @xmath189 @xmath190 the general form of @xmath191 follows from ( 4.6 ) @xmath192    equation ( 4.5 ) is similar to the plya equation for the generating function of the rooted trees on labelled vertices @xcite ( see also relation ( 4.17 ) below ) .",
    "the explicit expression ( 4.6 ) resembles the number of cayley trees on @xmath193 vertices .",
    "however , we did not find any obvious one - to - one correspondence between the set of cayley trees on @xmath193 vertices and the @xmath113-vertex diagrams we count . while the skeletons of our diagrams are given by trees , the maximal degree of these trees",
    "is bounded by @xmath22 .",
    "also , there are equivalent diagrams that have different tree skeletons .",
    "this makes the set of the diagrams we study quite different from the family of cayley trees .",
    "relation ( 4.4 ) generalizes recurrent relations for the catalan numbers . up to our knowledge , the class of diagrams @xmath194 as well as the numbers @xmath195 were not considered previously .",
    "v    let us separate the set of all possible values of triplets @xmath196 containing @xmath197 elements into the classes of equivalence labelled by @xmath198 .",
    "this is done in obvious way .",
    "then we can write that @xmath199 where @xmath200 denotes the number of elements in the equivalence class labelled by @xmath157 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 is one of the representative of this equivalence class . for instant , we can choose @xmath203 with minimal possible values of @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and so on , in the way such that @xmath208 belongs to the class @xmath157 .",
    "it follows from lemma 3.2 that @xmath209 using the basic property of the semi - invariants , we can write that @xcite @xmath210 where the sum runs over all unordered partitions @xmath211 of the set of vertices @xmath212 ; that is over all families of non - empty non - intersecting subsets @xmath213 of @xmath214 giving in sum all @xmath214 .",
    "the second argument of @xmath215 s reminds us that the variables @xmath216 attached to @xmath129 are chosen according to the rule prescribed by @xmath157 .",
    "random variable @xmath217 is given by the product of corresponding random variables @xmath122 .",
    "let us consider the term of the sum ( 4.10 ) that corresponds to the trivial partition @xmath218 of @xmath214 consisting of one subset only : @xmath219 .",
    "this term is given by the average value @xmath220 according to lemma 3.3 , there are @xmath169 non - colored elements in diagram @xmath157 , where @xmath166 is the number of color groups of arcs in @xmath157 .",
    "these grey elements represent independent random variables @xmath131 that are also independent from elements belonging to color groups .",
    "then we obtain the factor @xmath221 each color group produces the factor @xmath222 and there are @xmath166 color groups . then the weight of the partition @xmath223 is @xmath224 now it is clear that any other partition @xmath225 produces the term of the order @xmath226 that is evidently smaller than that of ( 4.10 ) .",
    "more precisely , we can write that @xmath227 where @xmath228 is equal to the number of the arcs @xmath229 of @xmath157 such that the left and right feet of @xmath229 belong to different subsets @xmath230 and @xmath231 of the partition @xmath225 under consideration .",
    "we say that these arcs are cut by partition @xmath225 .",
    "in particular , the partition @xmath232 of @xmath214 into @xmath113 subsets produces the factor @xmath233 because all @xmath147 arcs of @xmath157 are cut by this partition .    remembering that each arc can be drawn in the direct and inverse sense ( 3.8 ) and gathering formulas ( 3.6 ) , ( 4.8 ) , ( 4.9 ) and ( 4.11 ) , we conclude that @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the total number of diagrams @xmath157 .",
    "let us derive recurrent relations for @xmath195 .",
    "let us consider one particular diagram @xmath161 and denote by @xmath236 some part of @xmath157 that consists of certain @xmath152 vertices and all arcs that join them .",
    "let us now consider the last vertex @xmath237 .",
    "the following two cases are possible :    \\(a ) there is only one arc that joins @xmath237 with @xmath238 and    \\(b ) there are two arcs that join @xmath237 with @xmath238 .    clearly , the case when @xmath237 is joined with @xmath238 by three or more arcs is prohibited because of the absence of cycles in corresponding tree @xmath239 .    in the first case",
    "@xmath240 is a connex diagram .",
    "one can join this diagram with @xmath237 by an arc that have the left foot supported either on grey element or on the maximal element of the color group .",
    "if there are @xmath166 colour groups in @xmath240 , then there are @xmath241 grey elements ( see lemma 3.3 ) .",
    "there are @xmath166 maximal color elements .",
    "thus one can choose @xmath113 elements to put the left foot of the arc .",
    "the right foot can be put on one of the two elements of @xmath237 .",
    "clearly , @xmath242 .",
    "so , the case ( a ) produces @xmath243 connected diagrams . on figure 3",
    "we illustrate this situation .",
    "not let us pass to the case ( b ) .",
    "in this case @xmath240 is splitted in two connected diagrams .",
    "let us assume that the left element of @xmath237 is connected by an arc with the diagram constructed on @xmath152 vertices .",
    "there are @xmath244 possibilities to put the left foot of the arc .",
    "the right element of @xmath237 joined to the component of @xmath245 elements .",
    "there are @xmath246 possibilities to do this .",
    "the choice of the vertices to produce the component of @xmath152 elements gives @xmath247 possibilities",

    ", it is natural to ask the same question about asymptotic behavior of the @xmath296-step walks and study the terms of the cumulant expansion of variable @xmath297 it is not hard to show that in the situation of ( 6.2 ) , the reasonings of sections 3 and 4 remains true with obvious changes .",
    "the first modification is that instead of the two - valent vertices @xmath129 we have to consider @xmath296-valent vertices .",
    "more precisely , @xmath129 are represented by the linear graph with @xmath298 subvertices and @xmath296 edges that join them .",

    "let us count the number @xmath299 of connected reduced acyclic diagrams on @xmath296-stars .",
    "we start with the case @xmath300 .",
    "it is not difficult to repeat the proof of proposition 4.2 and to derive recurrent relations for @xmath301 @xmath302 @xmath303 with the initial condition @xmath304 . introducing the auxiliary numbers @xmath305 and setting @xmath306 ,",
    "it is not hard to show that ( 6.3 ) is equivalent to the following recurrent relation @xmath307 using ( 6.4 ) , we derive differential equation @xmath308 where @xmath309 .    in the general case of @xmath310",
    ", we obtain equation @xmath311 substitution @xmath312 leads us to equation @xmath313 resolving it and returning back to the function @xmath314 , we arrive at the equation that generalizes the plya equation @xmath315 using again the function @xmath316 and repeating computations of section 4 , we obtain relations to determine the coefficients @xmath317 ; @xmath318 in particular , for @xmath300 , we obtain the first values @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 that correspond to the sequence @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 .",
    "as we have seen , the discrete matrix model ( 2.5 ) we proposed represents an interesting source of questions about corresponding combinatorial structures .",
    "the limiting expressions we compute represent the first , zero - order approximation to the free energy per site of this model",
    ". it could be interesting to further develop the diagram approach to study the next terms of the @xmath325-expansion of this free energy and justify equality ( 4.18 ) .",
    "a special attention is to be paid for the limiting transition @xmath7 , @xmath326 .",
