    "there are many situations in physics where a continuous system obeying a particular set of equations at a macroscopic scale can be modeled by a discrete microscopic system obeying a very simple set of local rules .",
    "for example , in equilibrium statistical mechanics , simple lattice models such as the ising model capture the behavior of generic classes of critical systems at large scales . another interesting class of discrete systems are lattice gas automata  @xcite ; these models describe systems of particles moving about on a lattice , obeying simple collision rules which conserve quantities such as mass and momentum . in the macroscopic limit , these systems obey navier - stokes or other hydrodynamic equations of interest .    in the quantum domain ,",
    "there are also examples of discrete microscopic systems which capture interesting macroscopic behavior . lattice - gauge theories ( see for example creutz  @xcite ) give an approach to studying the partition function and spectra of quantum field theories by mapping these theories to statistical mechanical ensembles .",
    "there are , however , few discrete models for describing the dynamical evolution of quantum systems which preserve important features such as unitarity .",
    "an example of a quantum system for which a unitary discrete model is known is the dirac equation describing a relativistic particle moving in one spatial dimension .",
    "as shown by feynman  @xcite , this system can be described by a simple microscopic model of a particle moving on a 1d lattice according to a simple local rule which essentially corresponds to a unitary form of random walk .",
    "a straightforward attempt to realize a dirac equation in more than one spatial dimension as a form of unitary random walk can not succeed . by using operator splitting methods ,",
    "however , it was shown by succi and benzi  @xcite that a sequence of random moves along single axes , alternating with transformations which diagonalize each of the dirac matrices in turn , can give an analogous construction in higher dimensions . the discrete model for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dirac equation has been of renewed interest recently@xcite , due partly to the possibility of simulating such unitary microscopic discrete systems by quantum computers . in particular , it has recently been suggested@xcite that a simple quantum lattice model can be constructed which describes the motion of a system of many particles moving according to the one dimensional dirac equation .    in this paper",
    "we consider a class of models closely related to the 1d dirac lattice model , which give rise to a nonrelativistic single - particle schrdinger  equation in an arbitrary number of dimensions . in these models ,",
    "the time development rule is given by a single local , unitary transformation matrix .",
    "thus , we are essentially considering the motion of a single particle under a unitary random walk process .",
    "for this class of models we show that the macroscopic equation of motion satisfied by the wavefunction corresponding to particle density is the schrdinger  equation .",
    "we show that such nonrelativistic models can be constructed for an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions .",
    "we also show that an arbitrary potential can easily be included in these models .",
    "it is natural to generalize from the single particle models to a second quantized many - body system .",
    "such a model could be implemented very efficiently on a quantum computer , so that the number of computational steps necessary to simulate a single time step would only depend upon the size of the lattice and would not depend upon the number of particles in the system being simulated .",
    "thus , our results could be used to efficiently simulate an arbitrary nonrelativistic interacting quantum many - body system on a quantum computer exponentially faster than the same calculation could be performed on a classical computer .",
    "such a system would be an ideal example of quantum computing , since the computing elements could be built from a system of spin-@xmath0 particles on a lattice obeying simple local unitary time evolution rules .",
    "the principal difference between our models and the 1d dirac lattice model ( and its generalization by succi and benzi  @xcite ) is that in the dirac model , the unitary evolution rule satisfied by the wave function or particle at each time step is infinitesimally close to the identity transformation . as the lattice spacing @xmath1 goes to 0 ,",
    "the unitary transition matrix is of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is hermitian . in our models ,",
    "we take the transition matrix to be independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "this form of a time development equation makes the system nonrelativistic , but allows for a formulation in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "a closely related model was considered recently in one spatial dimension @xcite , where simulations were shown to be consistent with emergent behavior corresponding to a schrdinger  equation . in this paper",
    "we prove that this is the general behavior of such models , giving a simple algebraic relation between the transition matrix and the mass of the nonrelativistic particle .",
    "we develop such models for the schrdinger  equation in an arbitrary number of dimensions .    in the first part of this paper we will consider lattice models for single - particle motion .",
    "these models are essentially unitary lattice - boltzmann models@xcite . in the latter part of the paper we generalize to many - body systems and",
    "discuss how a lattice of quantum computing elements could be used to describe the motion of a large number of nonrelativistic quantum particles .",
    "we conclude with a simple numerical check of the analytic description of a sample model .    as a simple example of the type of system considered in this paper , consider the lattice - boltzmann model with a configuration space defined by two complex fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , taking independent values on a lattice with one spatial dimension @xmath6 and one temporal dimension @xmath7 .",

    "we now consider models in which multiple particles move independently according to the schrdinger  equation in @xmath81 dimensions .",
    "one way of simulating the motion of @xmath18 particles in @xmath81 dimensions is to introduce extra degrees of freedom for each particle .",

    "it is straightforward to incorporate an arbitrary interparticle potential in this formulation ; the potential is a function of the particle positions and can be included as discussed in section iii.c .",
    "this gives a procedure for simulating an interacting nonrelativistic quantum many - body system on a classical computer .",
    "although this may give a useful algorithm for systems containing only a few particles , if we wish to simulate the motion of a large number of particles using the method just described it is clear that the number of calculations needed to perform even one time step of the evolution become rapidly intractable .",
    "for example , simulating the motion of @xmath156 particles in three dimensions on a lattice of side length @xmath157 would take on the order of @xmath158 calculations per time step , beyond the capacity of any imaginable classical computer .    however , the technology of _ quantum computing_@xcite presents a paradigm in which such calculations can be done .",
    "we will now describe a way in which the above algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer with a speedup exponential in the number of particles .",
    "in fact , it is natural to simultaneously perform the calculation for all numbers of particles which will fit on the lattice , essentially performing a discrete simulation of nonrelativistic quantum many - body theory .",
    "the resulting model falls in the class of quantum lattice gas automata , which were recently defined by meyer  @xcite in the context of the @xmath159-dimensional dirac model .",
    "the exponential speedup of this algorithm on a quantum computer is a specific example of the general observation by feynman  @xcite and lloyd  @xcite that quantum mechanical systems can be simulated more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer .",

    "some small number of q - bits ( usually two or three  @xcite ) are subjected to a unitary time evolution , described by acting with a unitary matrix on the hilbert space of the affected elements .",
    "quantum computers have recently become of great interest because of the result due to shor@xcite that it is possible to factor large integers on a quantum computer in polynomial time , a procedure thought to be impossible on a classical computer .    in order to implement the many - body simulation described in the beginning of this section on a quantum computer , it is necessary to make some restrictions on the behavior of the many - body wavefunction under exchange of particles . the example system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) describes two particles moving in one dimension without interacting . in this model",
    ", both particles can be moving in the same direction from the same lattice site at a given point in time .",
    "we can modify this model slightly to give the particles exclusionary ( fermi ) statistics by making the transition matrix at @xmath161 force the two particles to move in different directions .",
    "this corresponds to introducing a contact interaction between the two particles when they move within a single lattice distance . by making the initial conditions antisymmetric under exchange of @xmath6 and @xmath162",
    ", we have a simulation of two nonrelativistic fermions moving in one dimension .",
    "alternatively , we could symmetrize the wavefunction and we would have a simulation of `` hard bosons '' which obey bose statistics but which can not occupy the same lattice site .",
    "either of these approaches naturally generalize to arbitrary numbers of particles and arbitrary dimensions .",
    "for the remainder of the discussion we assume that the particles obey bose statistics .",
    "the issue of implementing fermionic systems on a quantum computer is more subtle  @xcite , and has recently been addressed by abrams and lloyd  @xcite .    in previous sections we discussed the motion of a single particle , with a wave function @xmath163 .",
    "now , we would like to consider the state space for a quantum system of many particles .",
    "a natural basis for the hilbert space of such a system is the set of states in the fermionic fock space associated with the spatial lattice ; such states are identified by a set of occupation numbers @xmath164 ( taking values 0 or 1 ) for each possible particle position @xmath82 and internal index @xmath20 .",
    "the hilbert space of the model is thus @xmath165 dimensional , where @xmath21 is the number of possible values of the internal index , and @xmath166 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "first there is a collision step in which the particles at each lattice site interact .",
    "then there is an advection step , describing the propagation of the particles in the directions associated with the vectors @xmath83 .",
    "each of these steps is described in the quantum system by a unitary transfer matrix acting on the state space of the system .",

    "for example , acting on the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplestate ] ) , the result of applying the advection operator would be @xmath177 where we assume periodic boundary conditions on the lattice . the particle which was at lattice site @xmath169 has been advected to @xmath178 , and the two particles which were at @xmath171 have moved to @xmath179 and @xmath169 .",
    "we now consider the collision part of the time development rule .",
    "the collision process is defined by a single unitary @xmath160 by @xmath160 matrix @xmath180 , which acts separately on the quantum bits associated with each lattice site .",
    "thus , the state of the system is transformed by the unitary matrix @xmath181 given by the @xmath166-fold tensor product of @xmath180 .",
    "we would like the collision matrix @xmath180 to have the property that it conserves particle number .",
    "thus , this matrix is block diagonal in the subspaces of the hilbert space at each lattice site corresponding to a fixed particle number .",
    "we have now defined a discrete model for quantum many - particle systems . to understand the behavior of this model in the continuum limit ,",
    "let us consider the behavior when the number of particles in the system is relatively small compared to the number of lattice sites . in this case , at most lattice sites the number of particles present will be either 0 or 1 .",
    "this part of the dynamics , which describes the free propagation of single particles , is described by the part of @xmath180 in the single - particle hilbert space . however , because this is a unitary matrix , generically the dynamics described by this transition matrix is precisely that which we studied in the previous sections , and corresponds to a nonrelativistic particle propagating according to the schrdinger  equation .",
    "thus , for relatively sparse systems , this quantum lattice - gas model simulates a system of many nonrelativistic particles whose free propagation is given by the schrdinger  equation .",
    "the remaining parts of the collision matrix @xmath180 describe a contact interaction between the various particles .",
    "let us now discuss the computational complexity of the quantum algorithm . to implement the advection transformation by using quantum computing elements , it is only necessary to perform a series of exchanges of the values of the quantum bits representing the particle occupation numbers .",
    "the number of such exchanges is essentially equal to the number of bits , @xmath174 ( recall that on a euclidean lattice of dimension @xmath81 , @xmath182 , so that for example if @xmath183 , the advection operation can be implemented in approximately @xmath184 quantum operations ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath180 acts on the hilbert space associated with a subset of @xmath21 of the q - bits in the system .",
    "counting degrees of freedom , generically such a matrix can be implemented with approximately @xmath185 elementary quantum operations on pairs of q - bits .",
    "for example , in a 3d system , it would take on the order of 300 quantum operations to implement each @xmath180 matrix , so that the number of computational steps needed to perform the transformation by @xmath186 would be around @xmath187 .",
    "note , however , that the part of @xmath180 which acts on the multiple particle hilbert space simply changes the phases of a delta function type interaction between the particles .",
    "since these phases may not affect the results in most problems of physical interest , these components of @xmath180 can be arbitrary .",
    "thus , in practice we need only find a combination of operations on q - bits which will give a matrix @xmath180 which preserves particle number and gives the desired symmetry properties and eigenvalues , reducing the number of steps needed significantly below 300 .",
    "combining these observations , we see that this model can be simulated with on the order of @xmath166 elementary quantum computations at each time step ( or on the order of 1 if we are using a quantum computing system which allows parallel computation ) . since this system automatically contains the multi - particle wave function for all possible particle numbers , we have achieved an exponential increase in speed over what was possible on a classical computer .",
    "the system as defined so far only includes interactions between the particles in the form of delta function interactions parameterized by the components of @xmath180 in the multiple particle space .",
    "we can introduce an arbitrary interparticle potential @xmath188 by hand , by multiplying the wave function at each time step by the tensor product over all pairs of q - bits @xmath189 where the matrix @xmath190 acts on the hilbert space associated with the q - bits @xmath191 and @xmath192 , changing the phase of the wavefunction only in the component where both q - bits have the value 1 . implementing this interparticle potential",
    "will take on the order of @xmath193 quantum computations for each time step .",
    "although this significantly increases the computational complexity of the quantum algorithm , this is still exponentially faster than the analogous classical algorithm , since the particle number @xmath18 does not affect the complexity .",
    "note that , unlike the rest of the algorithm , the implementation of interparticle potentials involves nonlocal interactions on the lattice .    to clarify the discussion",
    ", we consider a simple example of a collision matrix @xmath180 . for a many - body system in one dimension",
    ", at each lattice site the collision matrix @xmath180 is a 4-by-4 matrix , acting on the hilbert space with basis @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 . since we are assuming that particle number is conserved and that the dynamics is symmetric under left - right reflection , the matrix @xmath180 is of the form @xmath198 where @xmath199 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath200 . by a simple global phase redefinition , we can choose @xmath201 .",
    "the part of @xmath180 in the single - particle hilbert space is precisely the form of the collision matrix @xmath27 from sec .",
    "[ sec : se1d ] . from the eigenvalues of this matrix",
    "we can determine the mass of the free particles in the model .",
    "finally , there is a single parameter @xmath202 which describes the phase with which two particles `` bounce '' . in this simple one - dimensional model",
    ", there is therefore little freedom in choosing the particle interaction . in higher dimensions",
    "there would be nontrivial phases describing delta function interactions between up to @xmath99 particles .",
    "one major concern in the implementation of any algorithm is the issue of precision .",
    "this problem is particularly acute on a quantum computer , where each quantum operation involves acting on the state with a unitary transformation which can only be controlled up to some finite precision .",
    "furthermore , on a quantum computer there is the related but distinct problem of decoherence which must be addressed in order for any quantum computation to be feasible .",
    "there has been a great deal of work recently describing how these problems can be solved using dynamical quantum error correction methods  @xcite . without going into this issue in depth",
    ", we make the simple observation that even without error correction , if the precision of each quantum operation is @xmath203 , then at each time step the error in the wave function will take a random step in the hilbert space with size @xmath204 . only after on the order of @xmath205 operations",
    "will this error become significant .",
    "thus , if we could achieve a precision better than @xmath206 , we could perform @xmath207 quantum operations successfully , which would allow us to simulate for example an interacting 3d system on a lattice with size of order @xmath208 . with the error correction schemes described in  @xcite , there is in principle no upper bound on how large a system could be simulated , other than the size of the quantum computer which could be built to perform the simulation .",
    "finally , we consider the issue of measurement in quantum lattice gases . in a classical lattice gas ,",
    "hydrodynamic quantities , such as mass and momentum density , are obtained by averaging particles mass and momentum over blocks in space and/or time . in a typical lattice - gas simulation , this is done from time to time to obtain the macroscopic variables of interest .",
    "the process of measuring these quantities is purely passive  that is , their measurement does not affect the subsequent dynamical evolution at all .",
    "in contrast , the analogous operation for a quantum lattice gas would involve occasionally measuring the state of some subset of the q - bits in the system , thus collapsing the quantum wavefunction onto the eigenstates of the ( space and/or time ) block number operator .",
    "the set of quantities which are accessible through this type of simulation are rather different from those accessible through simulation methods on a classical computer .",
    "for example , the dynamics of the system defines an effective hamiltonian which is an approximation to the hamiltonian of the many - body quantum system being simulated , however the spectrum of this hamiltonian is not directly amenable to measurement . instead",
    ", the types of observables which can be measured in the simulation are precisely equivalent to the types of observables which can be measured in an actual interacting quantum system . for example , a typical experiment might be to initialize the system in a particular known state at time @xmath209 , and to ask for the probability @xmath210 at time @xmath7 that there is a particle in a region of space @xmath211 .",
    "just as in the physical quantum system , we can ask such a question of our simulation ; we can perform the experiment a number of times , and each time we will find a particle with probability @xmath210 . to actually compute @xmath210 to some degree of accuracy requires repeating the experiment a number of times .",
    "to test the algorithm , we consider the dispersion relation of plane waves in periodic geometry in two dimensions .",
    "we consider a periodic grid with dimensions @xmath212 by @xmath212 , and initialize it with a plane wave of the form @xmath213 for @xmath214 , where @xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath217 are integers . choosing units where the spatial dimensions are of unit length , we have @xmath218 , and @xmath219    we evolve this initial condition in time , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdcm ] ) with @xmath220 ( hence @xmath221 ) for the collisions .",
    "every four time steps , we measure the inner product of the wave function with its initial condition , @xmath222 the result should go like @xmath223 , so the ratio of two successive values of this quantity is @xmath224 and hence the frequency is given by @xmath225 for a given wavevector @xmath226 , we measure this frequency at many time steps @xmath7 and take an average .",
    "we expect the evolution of the system to be governed by the schrdinger  equation , @xmath227 since @xmath221 , this leads to the dispersion relation @xmath228    we performed a series of simulations , where we considered wavenumbers @xmath229 and @xmath230 , where @xmath231 .",
    "the points plotted in fig .  [ fig : disp ] show the measured frequency @xmath232 as a function of @xmath233 .",
    "the solid curve is @xmath234 .",
    "it is evident that the agreement is excellent in the `` hydrodynamic '' limit of small @xmath235 , but degrades due to lattice artifacts of order @xmath236 at higher wavevector magnitudes . to demonstrate this",
    ", we include data for @xmath237 ( gray points ) and @xmath238 ( black points ) .",
    "it is evident that the dispersion relation is valid for higher wavenumbers on the larger lattice .",
    "we have considered a very general class of lattice models satisfying unitary time - evolution rules . we have shown that generic models of this type describe the evolution of a nonrelativistic particle according to the schrdinger  equation in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "these models can naturally be used to construct quantum lattice gases describing nonrelativistic many - body physics in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "it is straightforward to include an arbitrary interparticle potential into these models .",
    "there are many ways in which this work could be extended .",
    "numerical simulations could be performed in an arbitrary number of dimensions with multiple particles and with nontrivial spatially dependent potentials , and the results checked in analytically tractable cases .",
    "further analysis is needed to understand the behavior of the system in the regime where particles are dense .",
    "it might also be interesting to consider more general collision rules which create and destroy particles , possibly including antiparticles with separate quantum numbers .",
    "of course , the actual implementation of quantum lattice - gas models on quantum computing devices is something which may not be possible for many years , if ever .",
    "however , these lattice models give a simple framework with which to study problems in many - body theory . furthermore ,",
    "the methods described here are also quite practical for simulating systems of a few particles on a classical computer .",
    "it may be that the exact unitarity of these models at a microscopic level will make them more stable and possibly more useful than currently used discrete methods such as finite - difference approaches .",
