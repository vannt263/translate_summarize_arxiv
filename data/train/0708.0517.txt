    "in problems arising from physics and engineering one is interested in finding the smallest eigenvalue and/or corresponding eigenfunction of a given elliptic partial differential equation . depending on the context",
    ", this can be for example the lowest vibrational mode in mechanics , or the ground state energy in chemical structure calculation .    in a standard way an eigenvalue problem is posed in a weak formulation @xcite .",
    "we are looking for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath0 and corresponding eigenvector @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an appropriate banach space ( e.g. @xmath4 ) that is a dense and continuously embedded subspace of a hilbert space @xmath5 ( e.g. @xmath6 ) with inner product @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a bounded , symmetric and strongly positive bilinear form .",
    "furthermore we assume that the smallest eigenvalue @xmath9 is simple and well separated from the rest of the spectrum .    using finite element methods ( fem ) ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem can be efficiently solved numerically .",
    "however when the eigenfunction exhibits singularities , one has to use adaptive strategies to retain efficiency",
    ". for the iterative mesh generation one often uses local error estimators or indicators @xcite or , more recently , also dual weighted residual based goal oriented error estimators @xcite . in practice these methods perform well , but optimal convergence rates can not be proven yet @xcite .",
    "a benchmark for optimal convergence rate is the nonlinear best @xmath10-term approximation of the solution @xcite .",
    "therefore one can expect an adaptive algorithm at best to calculate an approximation to the solution with an effort which is proportional to the degrees of freedom needed for a best @xmath10-term approximation of the same accuracy .",
    "in this sense , a recent article @xcite following the spirit of @xcite showed optimal convergence of a perturbed preconditioned inverse operation for the solution of elliptic eigenvalue problems .",
    "as a basis one uses the operator formulation @xmath11 where @xmath12 corresponds to the bilinear form @xmath8 of equation ( [ eq : evp_bilinear ] ) and @xmath13 results from the @xmath5-inner product . then given a preconditioner @xmath14 for @xmath12 one determines @xmath15 up to an accuracy @xmath16 in each step , where @xmath17 is an appropriate step length and @xmath18 is the rayleigh quotient .",
    "the proof of convergence uses the fact that in a neighborhood of the eigenfunction the iteration is contracting for the part perpendicular to the corresponding eigenspace .    in the case of matrices a more geometrical proof is known @xcite .",
    "this proof assures convergence to the smallest eigenvalue for all starting vectors whose rayleigh quotient lies between the first and the second eigenvalue .",
    "therefore the domain of convergence can be substantially bigger compared to the alternative proof .",
    "the first aim is therefore to extend the proof from the matrix case @xcite to abstract spaces .",
    "this will substantially shorten our proof and improve our result from @xcite . moreover a more geometric and intuitive interpretation of the iteration is possible .",
    "we will show that , in order to retain convergence , each operator application has to be performed only with an accuracy proportional to the current error in the eigenfunction .",
    "we will show how the idealized iteration can be performed using only approximate operator applications which is a common practice in adaptive wavelet methods @xcite .",
    "our second aim is to apply the present abstract iteration to wavelet discretization .",
    "we will apply the adaptive wavelet algorithm to the model problem of a planar poisson eigenvalue problem on a polygonal domain . for these ansatz spaces",
    "the rate of approximation of an eigenfunction is determined by the regularity of the function in terms of besov spaces .",
    "therefore we will first determine this kind of regularity for the eigenfunctions .",
    "it will be shown that the eigenfunctions can be approximated arbitrarily well provided that the wavelets have a sufficient number of vanishing moments .",
    "this is in contrast to sobolev regularity , where the biggest inner angle of the domain restricts the smoothness of the eigenfunctions .",
    "therefore , for domains with reentrant corners , the adaptive scheme is superior to uniform refinement .",
    "we conclude the practical part by providing some numerical results for the l - shaped domain .    we will proceed along the following line .",
    "first , in section 2 , we fix notation and will rewrite the eigenvalue problem in terms of operators .",
    "after that the convergence of the abstract iteration including perturbations will be shown in section 3 . in section 4 we will concentrate on perturbations resulting from inexact operator applications . in the last section we will apply the abstract iteration to the case of a planar poisson eigenvalue problem , calculate the regularity of the eigenfunctions and provide numerical results for the l - shaped domain .",
    "in this section we will introduce the notation , state the basic assumptions and pose the problem in terms of operators .",
    "this is done using the abstract setting of a gelfand triple which will simplify the later analysis .    for that purpose",
    "let @xmath19 be a separable euclidean hilbert space , and @xmath20 a reflexive and separable banach space such that @xmath21 is dense and continuously embedded in @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath22 denote by @xmath23 and @xmath24 the respective dual spaces of @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "the dual pairing on @xmath25 and @xmath3 is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the spaces @xmath27 form a gelfand triple by identifying @xmath28 and @xmath5 by the riesz representation theorem .",
    "assume that we are given a bilinear form @xmath29 which is bounded , symmetric and strongly positive .",
    "we will consider the problem of finding the smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the weak eigenvalue problem @xmath30 equivalently this equation can also be written in operator form . through the riesz representation theorem , the bilinear form @xmath8 uniquely determines an operator @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 @xmath12 is bounded , strongly positive , and symmetric with respect to the dual pairing @xmath33 in the sense that @xmath34 hence there exist constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for the formulation of the eigenvalue problem in terms of operators we introduce the mapping @xmath38 which is induced by the inner product @xmath39 on @xmath5 . for convenience we will also denote its restriction @xmath40 by @xmath13 .",

    "generalization of such iteration schemes to operators were also considered in @xcite .",

    "an algorithm approximations are unavoidable in general .",
    "therefore we will from the very beginning modify the preconditioned inverse iteration ( pinvit ) in allowing for a perturbation in each step , reflecting the finite dimensional approximation of the involved quantities . in section [ sec : operator_ppinvit ] we will discuss the errors resulting from this approximate application of operators which is common in adaptive wavelet strategies @xcite .    to state our iteration scheme , we introduce a preconditioner of the operator @xmath12 , that is a symmetric operator @xmath57 , such that @xmath12 and @xmath14 are spectrally equivalent .",

    "the maximal accuracy @xmath167 needed for the approximate applications of @xmath12 and @xmath13 stays bounded by @xmath258    combining the algorithm with a time to time coarsening worked out in more detail in @xcite leads to an optimally convergent algorithm .",
    "it is likely that as in the case of boundary value problems @xcite a coarsening of the updates @xmath259 instead of the iterands gives a convergent algorithm with improved performance however we were not able to prove this conjecture yet .",
    "in this section the application of the abstract eigenvalue solver is discussed for the model case of a planar eigenvalue problem discretized by a stable wavelet base .",
    "the corresponding adaptive procedure is superior to uniform refinement if the corresponding eigenfunction has higher regularity in terms of certain besov spaces than in the scale of sobolev spaces .",
    "hence first we will address the besov regularity of the eigenfunctions and show that the eigenfunction can be approximated with an arbitrary high rate , provided that the wavelet ansatz function have sufficiently many vanishing moments .",
    "after that we provide some numerical tests for the case of an l - shaped domain with piecewise linear wavelets .",

    "to achieve this we employ the regularity results with respect to certain weighted sobolev spaces as were described in @xcite , see also the references therein",
    ".    for the construction of the weighted sobolev spaces define for each vertex @xmath263 an infinitely differentiable cut - off function @xmath268 that is equal to one in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath263 and zero outside , such that the support of the functions @xmath268 do not intersect .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the case of polygonal domains and scalar @xmath281 .    from theorem 6.6.1 in @xcite",
    "we can deduce the following regularity result :    the operator @xmath282 is an isomorphism between @xmath283 and @xmath284 for all @xmath285 .",
    "[ thm : sobolevreg ]    in particular this is a simplified version of theorem 6.6.1 in @xcite .",
    "just note that @xmath286 fulfills the condition @xmath287 since @xmath288 for all @xmath265 .",
    "having established the regularity result for boundary value problems with respect to the weighted sobolev spaces we can use a bootstrapping technique to deduce the regularity of the eigenfunctions .",
    "let @xmath289 be an eigenfunction for the poisson eigenvalue problem of equation .",
    "then @xmath290 [ thm : eigensobolev ]    the theorem is proven by induction . given the existence of @xmath267 as an eigenfunction we basically use the fact that @xmath267 is the solution of the boundary value problem with right hand side @xmath291 . hence with every application of theorem [ thm : sobolevreg ] we gain smoothness for the eigenfunction @xmath267 .",
    "we start the induction by noting that the eigenfunction @xmath292 . from definition [ def : weightedsobolev ] it follows directly that @xmath293 applying theorem [ thm : sobolevreg ] assures that the solution @xmath294 .    using the above fact as a starting point for an induction",
    "we will show that @xmath295 for all @xmath296 .",
    "suppose that @xmath295 for @xmath297 even . then by definition [ def : weightedsobolev ] of the weighted sobolev spaces it is obvious that @xmath298 .",
    "using theorem [ thm : sobolevreg ] it follows that @xmath299 and therefore @xmath300 .",
    "hence @xmath295 for all @xmath296 . noting that @xmath301 by definition [ def : weightedsobolev ] finishes the proof .",
    "in conclusion we have established arbitrarily high sobolev regularity for the eigenfunctions with respect to the appropriate weights .",
    "it remains to show that this also implies regularity in the sense of besov spaces . in order to show that , we use the norm equivalence between certain besov norms and the weighted discrete norms of the coefficients of a corresponding wavelet expansion .",
    "we will follow the line of proof that was also used to prove besov regularity in @xcite for the corresponding boundary value problem .",
    "for that purpose we use two - dimensional wavelets constructed from univariate orthonormal daubechies wavelets @xcite",
    ".    then for the set of supports @xmath302 ^ 2 ,    \\quad k \\in \\mathbb z^2 , \\ ; j",

    "@xmath305 is a set of three wavelets , since the space dimension is two .    for sufficiently regular wavelets",
    "there is a norm equivalence between the besov norm and the discrete norm of the wavelet expansion : a function @xmath306 for @xmath307 if and only if @xmath308 where @xmath309 denotes the set of all dyadic cubes of measure @xmath310 and @xmath311 is a projector onto a suitable subspace of @xmath312 .    from classical regularity analysis of grisvard @xcite",
    "we know that the eigenfunction @xmath313 . in order to apply the above norm equivalence , we first extend @xmath267 to the whole space @xmath314 by a whitney extension .",
    "we will denote the corresponding extended function also by @xmath267 ; it also has sobolev regularity @xmath315 , i.e. @xmath316 .",
    "now we proceed along the same lines as in @xcite .",
    "the approximation in the interior of @xmath270 and on the coarsest scale @xmath317 do not restrict the besov regularity .",
    "all what remains is to estimate the wavelet coefficients in the vicinity of the vertices . for that purpose",
    "we introduce the distance from a fixed vertex @xmath263 as @xmath318 where @xmath319 is a cube completely containing the support of @xmath320 . using the approximation order of wavelets , see e.g. @xcite we get @xmath321 if @xmath322 we can further estimate for each @xmath17 such that @xmath323 @xmath324 hence @xmath325 .",
    "next we sum up the contributions level by level .",
    "we introduce the set of indices corresponding to level @xmath326 by @xmath327 and for each level appropriate layers @xmath328 the wavelets in the vicinity of the vertices @xmath263 have to be treated separately and we restrict ourselves to the set @xmath329 for @xmath330 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath331 since the cardinality of @xmath329 is proportional to @xmath332 .",
    "choosing @xmath333 large enough ensures that the sum involving @xmath332 is finite .",
    "the summation over the refinement levels @xmath326 then amounts to sum up a geometric series .",
    "now the coefficients in the vicinity of the vertices can be estimated as in @xcite .",
    "then finally we arrive at a regularity result in terms of besov spaces .",
    "let @xmath289 be an eigenfunction for the poisson eigenvalue problem of equation .",
    "then @xmath334 [ thm : besovreg ]      the last paragraph showed that the eigenfunctions of our model problem have arbitrarily high regularity in the sense of besov spaces . however from classical regularity theory ,",
    "the regularity in terms of sobolev spaces is restricted by the biggest inner angle .",
    "in particular for the l - shaped domain the lowest eigenfunction can only be shown to be in @xmath335 for @xmath336 .",
    "this means that even for piecewise linear hat functions the convergence rate of for uniform refinement will be less than @xmath337 in the @xmath4 norm , where @xmath10 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast to this , usage of a piecewise linear wavelet bases with two vanishing moments in the adaptive algorithm ppinvit will lead to an optimal convergence rate of the eigenfunction in the @xmath4-norm with complexity @xmath338 @xcite .",
    "therefore , adaptive solution of the poisson eigenvalue problem is superior to uniform grid refinement . to conclude this paper , we will demonstrate this for the test example of the poisson eigenvalue problem on the l - shaped domain @xmath339 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the implementation of our eigenvalue solver is based on the adaptive wavelet code described in @xcite .",
    "the wavelet basis is constructed along the lines of @xcite which admits a diagonal preconditioner .",
    "moreover the set of active basis functions is limited to the case where the successor of each wavelet is also contained in the set .",
    "this results in the exact evaluation of an operator application for a given index set ; hence the rayleigh quotient can be calculated exactly .    as an algorithm we used one ppinvit_step followed by a galerkin eigenvalue solution on the fixed index set with an appropriate accuracy followed by a coarsening of the iterands .",
    "it turns out that the constants from sections 3 and 4 are too pessimistic and one can use much smaller values .    in figure",
    "[ fig : convergence ] the error in the rayleigh quotient in the smallest eigenvalue is shown . as a reference value we used @xmath340 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the error decreases like @xmath341 , which is as expected twice as high as the rate for the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "also of interest is the structure of the chosen wavelets which is shown in figure [ fig : index ] .",
    "the plot shows the center of the active ansatz functions during the sixth step for two different zoom levels .",
