    "the second byurakan survey ( sbs ) is an objective prism survey of @xmath5 carried out in the 1-m schmidt telescope of the byurakan observatory @xcite .",
    "the catalogue is complete at 85% for agns brighter than @xmath6 , from which it includes 761 objects : 155 seyfert ( sy ) galaxies , 596 quasi - stellar - objects ( qso ) and 10 bl lac objects .",
    "a considerable effort has been made to classify all the agns listed in the sbs .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations were carried out with the 6  m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao , russia ) , the 4.5  m multi - mirror telescope ( mmt , usa ) , the 2.6  m telescope of the byurakan observatory ( armenia ) , and the 2.1  m telescopes of the guilermo haro observatory and the national astronomical observatory in san pedro martir ( both in mexico ) . as a rule ,",
    "these follow - up observations had spectral resolutions of 5 - 6 or 10 - 11    over the spectral range of 3300 - 9000    ( see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "from the 155 sy galaxies , 38 are classified as broad line sy  1 , 31 as narrow line sy  1 ( nls1 ) , 25 as sy  1.5 , 8 as sy  1.9 , 44 as sy  2 .",
    "the catalogue also includes 90 low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , 562 starburst nuclei ( sbn ) and starburst galaxies ( sb ) , 195 blue compact dwarf galaxies , and 150  galaxies    agns are classified in two types according to their optical spectra .",
    "type  1 comprises the objects with broad permitted emission lines , and narrow permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "type  2 consists of the objects with only narrow lines .",
    "however , in the paradigm of the unified model ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the power source and physical conditions are thought to be inherently similar for both types of objects .",
    "the differences may arise from the amount of the intrinsic energy output , the angle of vision , and the contribution from luminous young stars .",
    "the intrinsic energy output or luminosity depends on the physical conditions in the inner part of the agn .",
    "two main quantities determine the energy production rate : the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) and the accretion rate .",
    "other variables , such as the bh angular momentum or the structure of the accretion disk , are of secondary importance and may be used to fine - tune the theoretical models . in the last years a strong correlation between the bh mass and the host - galaxy bulge velocity dispersion has been found for both inactive and active galaxies @xcite , which confirms the impact that the presence of the central bh has on the galaxy evolution . at the same time , reverberation mapping studies have uncovered empirical relations between the size of the broad line region ( blr ) and different estimates of the agn luminosity @xcite .",
    "according with the unified model , the viewing angle determines the observed properties of the agn . leaving relativistic - jet effects in radio loud agns aside",
    ", the unified model anticipates that the inner nuclear regions of agns are embedded inside dusty tori .",
    "the detection of broad emission lines in the polarized light of the sy  2 galaxy ngc  1068 by @xcite was a very convincing evidence that sy  1 and sy  2 galaxies are basically the same objects seen from different angles .",
    "depending on the angle of vision , the torus may obscure the inner region .",
    "type  1 objects are thus unobscured agn , while type  2 are obscured .",
    "classifying type  1 agn in different categories is to some extent less complicated than classifying type  2 objects .",
    "the broad bands arise exclusively from the blr of type  1 agns .",
    "this has lead to more phenomenological studies of the line profiles ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the lines arising from the narrow line region ( nlr ) often compete with the lines emitted from  regions - like , making difficult the interpretation of the theoretical results derived from photoionization models .",
    "evidence is growing that nuclear and star formation activities may have a common trigger , which complicates the classification process .",
    "in reality , many objects are probably misclassified because of poor quality and low resolution spectroscopic data @xcite , problems to separate the broad and narrow components of the balmer lines , and the presence of  blends that interferes with the measurements of the intensity and the profile parameters of @xmath1 .",
    "this paper initially presents spectral observations of eight sbs objects and one companion galaxy of sbs  1204 + 505b to investigate the intrinsic reddening , the central bh mass , the size of the blr , and to review their classification .",
    "the term _ companion _ will be used hereafter exclusively to designate the companion galaxy of sbs  1204 + 505b reported in this paper . any other galaxy which may be related with other sbs objects",

    "the  denomination is suggested because the measured gravity center of the line in the qso rest - frame is at @xmath159 and , moreover , there are also other  and  lines detected in the spectrum . however , other atomic ions have also permitted lines that dwell in the same region .",
    "@xcite found a emission line at 5050    in akn 120 that @xcite proposed to be @xmath160 o perhaps @xmath161 .",
    "a similar feature was also reported by @xcite in the spectrum of ngc 5548 .",
    "an indication of the temperature and density in the nlr can be obtained from the [ ]  lines . following @xcite , the sum of the [ ]  @xmath162 and [ ]  @xmath23 fluxes divided by the [ ]  @xmath155 flux has a value of 7.35 , which indicates either a high temperature ( @xmath163 ) or most probably a high electron density ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "finally , the bh mass estimated from the @xmath1  and [ ]  line widths approximately agree within a factor of 2 ( @xmath165 , respectively , see table [ tab : masses ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of 8 sbs extragalactic sources , as well as one companion galaxy , have been made using the oan 2.1-m telescope at san pedro mrtir , mexico .",
    "the spectra in all but one case ( sbs  0944 + 540 ) covers the rest frame @xmath1  and @xmath0 regions with a spectral resolution of 4.5   .",
    "the data has been corrected for redshift and for galactic extinction in order to derive spectrophotometric parameters and line ratios .",
    "the spectra have been analyzed in detail and several faint emission lines have been measured .",
    "any feature that strongly suggests the presence of an emission line was also reported .",
    "blends have been subtracted and their ew measured .",
    "these subtractions have allowed a better estimate of the emission lines parameters for @xmath1  and the [ ]  @xmath48 . frequently , the  subtraction has also made possible the identification and measurement of  @xmath166 and , in one case , a feature that is identified as @xmath4 .",
    "gaussian profiles were used to fit both the broad and the narrow emission lines . in most cases ,",
    "a single component was used , except for the balmer lines , which usually presented a narrow as well as one or more broad components .",
    "some line profiles can also be described using lorentzian fits with a lesser number of components . in these cases ,",
    "the lorentzian parameters for the broad lines have been reported .",
    "emission line fwhm and line ratios have been used , along with diagnostic diagrams , to separate agns from  regions - like .",
    "thus it was possible to review the classification of all objects . in two cases ,",
    "a revised classification is proposed .",
    "intrinsic reddening ,  color excess , @xmath83 extinction coefficients and optical depths for the @xmath3 band , and at wavelengths corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath1  and 5100   , were calculated for all the objects with narrow balmer components , and assuming that the local reddening has a continuous distribution along the line of sight and that the optical properties of the dust in the host - galaxy are the same as in the solar neighborhood .",
    "several parameters of the central black hole have been calculated with different methodologies and the results are compared .",
    "the mass of the central supermassive black hole has been inferred from its correlation with both the bulge stellar velocity dispersion ( measured from the [ ]  @xmath23 fwhm ) , and from the luminosity and fwhm of @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity has been estimated from both the monochromatic flux at 5100    and the integrated flux of the broad @xmath1  component .",
    "* sbs  0848 + 526 is a reddened sbn which has a plume extending to a brighter neighbor seyfert galaxy .",
    "the plume emits @xmath0 , @xmath1  and [ ]  lines . *",
    "sbs  0944 + 540 is a qso with strong  blends and without evidence of narrow lines .",
    "the @xmath1  profile is strongly asymmetric and shows a large blue bump and extended wings .",
    "* sbs  1118 + 541 and 1136 + 595 are nls1 which present many similarities .",
    "both show discrepancies in the fwhm of the broad balmer components used for their classification , depending on whether they were fitted using gaussian or lorentzian profiles .",
    "their line ratios calculated from the gaussian fits correspond to  regions - like .",
    "there are differences in the widths among all the narrow lines , and particularly the narrow balmer components are much broader than the forbidden lines , suggesting a stratification of the nlr .",
    "both objects show low amounts of reddening and the masses of their black holes , estimated from the lorentzian fit for @xmath1 , are one order of magnitude below the mass estimation from the gaussian fit or from the [ ]  fwhm . * sbs  1136 + 594 is a sy  1.5 galaxy showing a large amount of reddening .",
    "the mass of the black hole estimated from the [ ]  fwhm is rather low for a sy  1.5 and a factor 44 times smaller than the mass calculated from the @xmath1  fwhm .",
    "* sbs  1204 + 505b is an agn with at least one companion galaxy , and is more probably a member of a compact group .",
    "the nucleus is reddened , and , in contrast with @xmath0 , the broad component of @xmath1  is not detected in the spectrum presented in this paper .",
    "this feature leads to classify the object as a sy  1.9 , rather than a sy  1.8 as proposed in the sbs catalogue .",
    "the companion of sbs  1204 + 505b reported in this paper is a very reddened sbn .",
    "however , the weak @xmath1 line has a fwhm of 450 km  s@xmath8 , which is larger than the width expected for this kind of objects . *",
    "sbs  1340 + 569 is probably a sy  1.8 galaxy with a sbn component .",
    "the diagnostic plots for the available line ratios cover both the agn and  region domains .",
    "besides , there is a variety of line widths for different ions and between the broad and narrow components of @xmath0  and @xmath1 , being the widths of the narrow lines in the @xmath0  region rather small for an agn .",
    "the amount of reddening is small , as well as the size estimated for the blr ( @xmath167 light days ) .",
    "* sbs  1626 + 554 is a qso whose permitted lines need two broad profiles to be fitted .",
    "the broadest component is redshifted by about 1000 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "narrow components are suggested for all these three lines , but their s / n are too low to be measured reliably .",
    "the  @xmath49 is discernible after the subtraction of the strong blends .",
    "a peculiar broad emission line , probably @xmath4 , is observed and its parameters measured .",
