    "most high energy processes contain several energy scales which complicate the analysis in perturbation theory .",
    "one classic example is the elastic form factor of an elemental particle ( such as quark or electron ) at large momentum transfer @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic form factor is usually called sudakov form factor . in one - loop corrections to the sudakov form factor ,",
    "a double - logarithms like @xmath1 with @xmath2 a low mass scale will appear .",
    "for the case @xmath3 , the large double - logarithms spoil convergence of the perturbative expansion even if the coupling constant @xmath4 is small and they should be resummed to obtain a well - behaved expansion in perturbation theory .",
    "a lot of theoretical attempts had been made to sum the series @xmath5 to all orders @xcite .",
    "all the methods found that the sudakov form factor exponentiates and damps rapidly when @xmath0 approaches infinity .",
    "we refer to the summation of double logarithms as sudakov resummation .",
    "sudakov form factor is very interesting in theory because it provides the simplest example to explain basic ideas of the sudakov resummation .",
    "the earliest treatment in @xcite introduces the leading double - logarithmic approximation method which chooses the most important contributions of feynman diagrams and then sum them to all orders .",
    "most other methods utilize the standard renormalization group ( rg ) technics , such as in @xcite .",
    "the central ingredients in them are factorization and renormalization group equation , although the detailed technics involve different emphasizes .",
    "the separation of the form factor into the hard , collinear and soft parts for each momentum region leads to evolution equations and consequently to sudakov resummation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors point out a close relation between the factorization and the matching process in effective field theory .",
    "the effective field theory provides a simple and powerful method to study processes with several disparate energy scales .",
    "recent interests on sudakov resummation come from the study by using a soft - collinear effective field theory ( scet ) .",
    "scet is a theory proposed for collinear and soft particles to simplify the analysis for the processes with highly energetic hadrons @xcite .",
    "this scet is a development of the early large energy effective theory @xcite which includes the collinear quark and soft gluons only .",
    "it was shown in @xmath6 decays that the summation of the sudakov logarithms is much simpler in the effective field theory than the analysis in the full theory @xcite .",
    "this method of summing double - logarithms had been extensively used in exclusive b decays such as in @xcite .    the baic idea for summing the large logarithms in the effective field theory",
    "can be expressed through an example of b meson decay @xcite .",
    "one - loop corrections are enhanced by large logarithm @xmath7 with @xmath8 the mass of w - boson and b - quark .",
    "we separate the large logarithm @xmath7 into the hard @xmath9 and the soft @xmath10 parts .",
    "the effective field theory integrates out the heavy @xmath11-boson and the hard gluons with virtualities between @xmath12 and a renormalization scale @xmath13 .",

    ", it leads to a consistent rg equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) .",
    "this is the result that sudakov form factor does not depend on choice of the renormalization scale @xmath13 .",
    "one intuitive understanding of the renormalization and the rg equation is from the wilson s renormalization group method for critical phenomena in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "note that idea of effective field theory originates from this method . from @xcite , the sudakov form factor is a multi - scales system rather than only two scales @xmath21 .",

    "the procedure for integrating out the intermediate momentum fluctuations scale by scale form a cascade chain to give a rg equation and a deamplification ( suppression ) effect . in @xcite , it is pointed out that each qcd evolution equation ( such as dglap , bfkl and sudakov evolution equation ) is associated with a cascade mechanism represented by ladder diagram .",
    "we find a strong similarity of the cascade mechanism in the renormalization group method and the leading ( double-)logarithmic approximation method . based on this understanding ,",
    "we give an interpretation of the sudakov form factor from scale point of view .",

    "2 , we discuss the wilson lines and scet in brief and then calculate the sudakov form factor in the framework of scet . in sect .",
    "3 , we compare the different approaches of sudakov resummation and discuss the physical interpretation of the sudakov form factor . in sect .",
    "4 , the brief discussions and conclusions are given .",
    "one property of the scet is that it involves different types of wilson line . in principle",
    ", the appearance of the wilson line is due to the local gauge invariance of qcd .",
    "the qcd lagrangian for a massless quark field @xmath22 is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the local gauge invariance permits us to write a formal form as[eq : line](x)=w(x )  ^0(x ) ,   w(x)= ( ig_s_c^x dy^a_(y ) ) . where @xmath25 represents a path and @xmath26 denotes path - ordering .",
    "it should be noted that the eq .",
    "( [ eq : line ] ) is a formal formulae . under the above transformation or",
    "say the field redefinition , all effects of the gluon fields are included in a path - dependent phase factor @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 is the quark field with no interaction with gluons and it satisfies the equation of motion for free quark @xmath29 . the function of @xmath27 is called wilson line which accumulates infinite gluons along a path . the path - dependent phase factor of the wilson line had been introduced for a long time .",
    "a closed - path form of the wilson line ( called wilson loop ) is proposed as a mechanism of quark confinement @xcite .    in qcd , the infrared ( ir )",
    "contributions are enhanced by ir divergences when the virtual fields become on - shell .",
    "these on - shell fields behave like classical particles and have an infinity numbers .",
    "these ir particles may be analogous to the case of confined particles .",
    "if the wilson lines can be applicable to absorb a lot of gluons , it will lead to a great simplification in theoretical analysis . in scet , which is a low energy effective theory of qcd to describe the soft and collinear particles",
    ", we will see the appearance of soft and collinear wilson lines and these wilson lines are indispensable quantities .",
    "it is convenient to use the light - cone coordinates to study the processes with energetic light hadrons or jets .",
    "an arbitrary four - vector @xmath30 is written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two light - like vectors which satisfy @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",

    "the momenta of the collinear and soft particles are scaled as @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    in this study , we concern only the lowest order interaction of @xmath44 of the collinear and soft particles . because we discuss the on - shell sudakov form factor , the ultrasoft particles will not be considered . to simplify the illustration , we discuss a case that collinear particles move close to @xmath45 direction .",
    "other cases can be given straightforwardly .",
    "the lagrangian which describes the interaction of the collinear quark with collinear gluons is written as @xcite[eq : cc]l_c=|  . where @xmath46 represent the covariant derivative for collinear momentum regions .",
    "one property of the collinear lagrangian is that it is non - local which is different from other effective field theories of qcd .",
    "the reason for this non - local interaction is that the momentum component @xmath47 of collinear particles is at the same order of the virtuality of the heavy mode .    for the interactions of collinear fields with soft gluons",
    ", the momentum of the collinear particle does not retain its scaling when a soft particle couples to it , @xmath48 .",
    "the effective lagrangian given in @xcite can only be interpreted as an intermediate theory . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that the soft gluons decouple from the collinear quark or gluon in the lowest order of @xmath44 .",
    "the effects of soft gluons are included in the soft wilson line w_s(x)=p  exp ( ig_s_-^x dt  n_-a_s(tn_- ) ) . where the path - ordering @xmath26 defined such that the the gluon fields stand to the left for larger values of parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the soft wilson line @xmath50 describes the effect of infinite soft gluons moving along the @xmath45 direction from @xmath51 to point @xmath52 . for the collinear gluons",
    ", the case is different .",
    "we can not decouple the collinear gluons from the collinear quark in the same way as the soft gluons .",
    "the thing we can do is to decouple collinear gluon @xmath53 from the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) . this can be expressed as [ eq : wc]=w_cw_c^ ,  w_c(x)=p  exp ( ig_s_-^x dt  n_+a_c(tn_+ ) ) .",
    "( [ eq : wc ] ) means that when we integrate out the hard mode ( it refers to heavy degrees of freedom in the effective field theory ) , the @xmath53 collinear gluons can be grouped into a wilson line along the @xmath54 direction . in other words ,",
    "the coupling of collinear gluons to the hard mode is equivalent to the coupling to a wilson line .",
    "another explanation of the above soft and collinear wilson lines is that the longitudinal polarized gluon ( @xmath55 ) is unphysical thus it can be gauged into a phase factor due to gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the scet has a remnant gauge invariance under the collinear and soft transformations which do not change momentum fluctuations of the collinear and soft particles .",
    "the collinear and soft gauge transformations @xmath56 are constrained by momentum regions @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "the matrix element @xmath66 has no ultrasoft ( uv ) divergence and the form factor @xmath67 is independent of the renormalization scale @xmath13 . but @xmath67 contains logarithms @xmath68 in one - loop vertex correction depicted in fig .",

    "these ideas are analogous to our intuitive understanding about the renormalization group method although they are expressed in different languages .    at last , we discuss the dependence of the sudakov form factor on the regularization methods . in @xcite , the one - loop correction to the form factor",
