    "pion photo- and electroproduction both have a long tradition as a tool to obtain information on strong as well as electroweak properties of the pion and the nucleon .",
    "for example , as early as 1954 kroll and ruderman @xcite , in their famous low - energy theorem ( let ) , discussed the possibility of extracting the renormalized pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath0 from charged pion photoproduction at threshold . besides lorentz covariance , the essential ingredient entering the derivation of the kroll - ruderman theorem was the application of the ward identity @xcite resulting from gauge invariance .",
    "the algebra of currents and the hypothesis of a partially conserved axial - vector current ( pcac ) resulted in additional constraints such as the theorem of fubini , furlan , and rossetti @xcite establishing a sum rule for pion photoproduction in terms of the anomalous isovector and isoscalar magnetic moments of the nucleon .",
    "the potential of investigating the axial - vector form factor of the nucleon through the electroproduction of charged pions was first realized by nambu and shrauner in the framework of the chirality formalism @xcite .",
    "subsequently , their result has been recovered and extended within various approaches @xcite ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the current - algebra and pcac approaches of the 1960 s ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) had in common that they made no explicit reference to the dynamical origin of the underlying symmetry . in our present understanding ,",
    "the symmetry currents originate in a global chiral @xmath1 invariance of qcd for @xmath2 massless quark flavors .",
    "as already pointed out by gell - mann @xcite , even if a continuous symmetry is violated by large effects , it will still have some physical consequences , which can be studied if the symmetry breaking pattern is explicitly known . in the present context",
    ", the symmetry breaking in question is associated with the finite quark masses .",
    "it is rather straightforward to derive the so - called chiral ward identities among qcd green functions implied by the symmetry currents and the symmetry - breaking pattern , while it is more difficult to actually satisfy these constraints in practical calculations .",
    "however , in the framework of effective field theory , the chiral ward identities will automatically be satisfied if the underlying chiral symmetry ( and its breaking pattern ) is systematically mapped onto the most general effective lagrangian in terms of the relevant experimentally observed degrees of freedom @xcite . turning this mapping into useful consequences",
    "requires a method which allows for a rigorous analysis of a particular contribution to a green function in terms of some expansion scheme .",
    "this is provided by weinberg s power counting @xcite which makes use of the special role played by the pion as the approximate goldstone boson of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "its weak coupling to other hadrons in the low - energy limit , in combination with its small mass , allow for an analysis of the low - energy structure of qcd green functions in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "in the single - nucleon sector a consistent power counting has been developed for both the so - called heavy - baryon formulation @xcite and , more recently , also for the relativistic approach @xcite .",
    "the present work aims at shedding additional light on the importance of chiral ward identities in the context of extracting the axial form factor of the nucleon from pion electroproduction experiments .",
    "we will first show that , within the framework of qcd coupled to external fields , the pcac relation for a particular choice of the pion interpolating field is of the same form as the one originally obtained by adler @xcite through minimal substitution .",
    "this is due to the fact that , within qcd , the quark fields entering the symmetry currents are fundamental , i.e. , point - like degrees of freedom .",
    "our subsequent discussion of the chiral ward identities will be performed in the framework of a tree - level approximation to chiral perturbation theory in order to keep the line of arguments as transparent as possible . in terms of a loop expansion such tree - level diagrams",
    "may be understood as the leading order in an expansion in terms of @xmath3 @xcite . moreover",
    ", chiral ward identities are expected to be satisfied order by order in the loop expansion @xcite .",
    "of course , chpt also allows one to systematically evaluate corrections to the tree - level results . in the context of pion photo- and electroproduction",
    "this was done in a series of papers by bernard _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the effective - field - theory approach we will point out the distinction between the chiral ward identities and the so - called electromagnetic ward - takahashi identities @xcite applying to the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the origin of these additional identities resides in the fact that the effective hadronic degrees of freedom , namely pions and nucleons , are carriers of u(1 ) representations . as a consequence",
    ", the building blocks of a calculation in the effective theory also have to satisfy these identities .",
    "our approach will allow us to clarify a discussion triggered by a paper of haberzettl @xcite , where it was argued that in the case of pion electroproduction pcac does not provide any additional constraints beyond the goldberger - treiman relation .",

    "we first note that @xmath261 involves field - strength tensors as opposed to pure covariant - derivative terms .",
    "moreover , due to the nonlinear realization it contains a string of terms with an increasing number of pion fields .",
    "the lowest - order term involving one external axial - vector field , @xmath263 gives rise to a contribution to the axial - vector current matrix element .",
    "it is responsible for the identification of the @xmath102 term with the axial radius . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no term with only one pion , i.e. , no contribution to the @xmath264 vertex of eq .",
    "( [ pnvertex ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is also no contribution to the strong form factor @xmath118 of eq .",
    "( [ gt1 ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath265\\ ] ] contributes to the @xmath258 vertex .",
    "thus , we clearly see how chiral symmetry relates for this particular term ( a part of ) the axial - vector current vertex with ( a part of ) the @xmath258 vertex . on the other hand , this relation is not generated by the gauge - derivative method .",
    "we have re - investigated adler s pcac relation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field @xcite within the framework of qcd coupled to external fields @xcite . with a suitable choice for the interpolating pion field",
    "the qcd result is of the same form as adler s pre - qcd version .",
    "we then discussed the adler - gilman relation @xcite as a chiral ward identity in terms of qcd green functions and established the connection with the pion electroproduction amplitude . in order to explain the consequences of the adler - gilman relation , we made use of a tree - level approximation to the green functions at @xmath63 within relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "as a reference point we first performed a direct calculation of the pion - production transition current , @xmath57 , in terms of the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "we saw explicitly how the axial radius enters charged - pion electroproduction at @xmath63 . as an alternative we calculated the green function @xmath266 involving the electromagnetic current and the pseudoscalar density and , using the lsz reduction formalism , explicitly verified the connection with the pion electroproduction transition current determined previously .",
    "again we saw that the axial radius enters this particular green function . as a test of our result we verified a chiral ward identity relating the divergence of @xmath266 to the matrix element of the pseudoscalar density .",
    "we then calculated the green function @xmath256 involving the electromagnetic and axial - vector currents , tested the constraints due to gauge invariance , and , finally , explicitly verified the adler - gilman relation for _ arbitrary _ values of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , all three possibilities of calculating pion electroproduction  direct calculation , determination in terms of the qcd green function @xmath266 , or application of the adler - gilman relation  generate the same result .",
    "we then made contact with the traditional current - algebra or pcac techniques by defining a generalization @xmath267 of the physical pion electroproduction transition current in terms of the qcd green function @xmath266 for arbitrary values of @xmath205 .",
    "we considered the soft - momentum limit of @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and showed that the usual `` soft - pion '' results are recovered if the pseudoscalar density is used as the pion interpolating field .",
    "we pointed out how the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry leads to an interplay between various vertices in the most general theory and how approximations such as minimal substitution may fail to be compatible with the strictures of chiral symmetry and can lead to erroneous conclusions .",
    "clearly , chiral perturbation theory has become the standard method to systematically deal with _",
    "corrections _ to the current - algebra results beyond the phenomenological approximation .",
    "the contribution of loops diagrams are expected to separately satisfy the constraints due to the ward identities . in the case of pion photo- and electroproduction",
    "such corrections were determined in refs .",
    "@xcite leading to additional terms beyond the current - algebra results .",
    "obviously , it would be nice to have a fully relativistic calculation within the infrared regularization @xcite or the extended - on - mass - shell scheme @xcite including an explicit test in terms of the adler - gilman relation .",
