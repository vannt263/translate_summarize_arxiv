    "for three ( supposedly weak ) pulsars from the fermi pulsar catalog @xcite , psrs j1057 - 5226 , j1741 - 2054 , j2055 + 2539 , we measure , to some 10% accuracy , the distances : d=0.41 ,  0.37 ,  0.35i_45 ^ 1/2kpc , respectively ; @xmath0 are the moments of inertia in units of @xmath1 .",
    "the catalog lists these distances as d=0.30.2 ,  0.380.02 ,  < 15.3kpc , respectively . then , for psr j1741 - 2054 , we have i_45=1.10.2  .",
    "have we had better numerics , we would have measured absolute distances ( and moments of inertia , @xcite(c ) ) directly from fermi and checked the observers suspiciously accurate distance to psr j1741 - 2054 .",
    "( the theory of gamma - ray emission turned out to be so simple , that , after good coding , it should become more reliable than the dispersion - measure distance determination . )",
    "as it is , due to poor numerical accuracy ( appendix ) , we do the measurement by a downgraded procedure which uses only lightcurves and efficiencies , but not the spectra ; this gives only the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement procedure is outlined in  [ procedure ] ; the implementation and results are presented in  [ results ] .",
    "from the catalog we take the following :    * period @xmath3 ; * period derivative @xmath4 ; * bolometric flux @xmath5 ( @xmath6={{\\rm erg}\\over { \\rm cm}^2{\\rm s}})$ ] ; * bolometric lightcurve @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the pulse phase ; @xmath7 is proportional to the bolometric flux at a given phase , and normalized by @xmath9 .",
    "catalog lightcurves are actually in `` w. counts / bin '' , and we are not sure how to translate this into a bolometric lightcurve ; but as our procedure uses only some seemingly robust morphological characteristics of the lightcurves , we do not expect a large error from this uncertainty .",
    "( the chosen pulsars have lightcurves with pronounced morphology ) .",
    "( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the labels indicate the observation angle and the efficiency @xmath11 . following observers convention , we plot two periods , and normalize the full phase to one .",

    "here @xmath12 is the spin - dipole angle , @xmath13 is the observer angle ( the angle between the spin axis and the direction to observer ) . * bolometric efficiency [ eff ] =( , ) , defined as the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity ( as seen at observation angle @xmath13 ) to the spin - down power .",
    "the measurement procedure is then :    * use eq.([curve ] ) to fit the lightcurve , thereby measuring both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "* use eq.([eff ] ) to calculate the bolometric luminosity ( in terms of the known @xmath3 and @xmath4 and unknown @xmath14 ) , and then , knowing the bolometric flux @xmath5 , deduce the distance to the pulsar , @xmath15 .",
    "we use the numerical procedure of @xcite(b ) to calculate theoretical bolometric lightcurves @xmath16 and efficiencies @xmath17 .",
    "we then perform a visual fit of the lightcurve morphology : for each calculated magnetosphere ( of various spin - dipole angles @xmath12 ) , we adjust an observation angle @xmath13 so as to make the lightcurve single - peak and as `` pedestal''-like as possible , or single - peak and as `` high - chair''-like as possible .",
    "psrs j1057 - 5226 and j1741 - 2054 , at our level of accuracy , are both single - peak `` pedestals '' , although of a different full width at half - maximum , @xmath18 and 0.29 , respectively ; psr j2055 + 2539 is a single - peak `` high - chair '' of width @xmath19 .",
    "we get satisfactory morphology fits at various spin - dipole angles ; but as shown in the table , these best fits come with different full widths at half - maximum @xmath20 .",

    "the way we code , we get convergence of the calculated emission spectrum in axisymmetry only at 1600x3200 resolution @xcite(a ) .",
    "we also find that at least a 5x10 ( light cylinders ) box is needed , and the star radius , @xmath49 , should be smaller than about 0.2 .    in three dimensions @xcite(b ) , we calculate an @xmath50 star , at a @xmath51 resolution , in a @xmath43 box , which corresponds to a 135x270 resolution in a 3x6 axisymmetric box . to gauge our results , we have calculated an aligned pulsar by the three - dimensional code ; comparing the results to the high - resolution axisymmetric simulation , we see that the accuracy of the calculated curvature is poor , and hence we can not reliably calculate the spectrum for the computed three - dimensional magnetospheres .",
    "on the other hand , the computed electromagnetic field ( and hence velocities of charges , and hence the lightcurves ) and also the calculated efficiencies are close in the two simulations .",
    "we have therefore decided to use only the calculated efficiencies and lightcurves , hoping that the photon cutoff energy ( which was reliably calculated only in axisymmetry ) is not very sensitive to the spin - dipole angle ( at fixed spin - down power ) ; this needs to be checked ."

    "<S> to illustrate the standard candle property of gamma - ray pulsars ( and also to thereby confirm the recent first - principle calculation of pulsar gamma - ray emission ) , we `` measure '' , via the lightcurve fitting , three distances and one moment of inertia of some weak pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we are not sure what the three distances are good for , but the measurement of the moment of inertia must be of interest for nuclear physics .    although we must state that the quality of the numerical program which we use to calculate the lightcurves and efficiencies is inadequate ( as are the author s qualifications as a numericist and data analyst ) , in good hands , and upon an easily doable extension to non - weak pulsars , the method s yield should be impressive </S>"
