    "the comb - like models have been introduced to investigate anomalous diffusion in low - dimensional percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "it means that the mean square displacement ( msd ) has power - law dependence on time @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "an elegant form of equation which describes the diffusion on a comb - like structure was introduced by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath6 is the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath7 direction with physical dimension @xmath8=\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}$ ] , and @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath10 direction with physical dimension @xmath11=\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath12 function in the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath7 direction implies that the diffusion along the @xmath7 direction occurs only at @xmath13 .",
    "thus , this equation can be used to describe diffusion in the backbone ( at @xmath13 ) where the teeth play the role of traps .    nowadays ,",
    "comb models have many applications .",
    "they have been used for the understanding of continuous @xcite and discrete @xcite non - markovian random walks .",
    "there are generalizations of this equation by introducing time fractional derivatives and integrals in ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb ] ) @xcite .",
    "such generalized comb - like models have been used to describe anomalous diffusion in spiny dendrites , where the msd along the @xmath7 direction has a power - law dependence on time @xcite , or for describing subdiffusion on a fractal comb @xcite , the mechanism of superdiffusion of ultra - cold atoms in a one dimensional polarization optical lattice @xcite as a phenomenology of experimental study @xcite , and to describe diffusion processes on a backbone structure @xcite .",
    "different generalizations of the comb model have been shown to represent more realistic models for describing transport properties in discrete systems , such as porous discrete media @xcite , electronic transport in semiconductors with a discrete distribution of traps , cancer development with definitely fractal structure of the spreading front @xcite , infiltration of diffusing particles from one material to another @xcite , description of diffusion of active species in porous media @xcite , etc .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it is shown that in a comb - like model a negative superdiffusion occurs due to the presence of an inhomogeneous convection flow .    in this paper",
    "we consider a generalization of eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb ] ) where we allow that diffusion along the @xmath7 direction may occur on many backbones , located at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this means that we have a comb grid where @xmath0 can be arbitrarily large , even infinity .",
    "the governing equation for such a structure is given by where @xmath17 are structural constants such that @xmath18 .",
    "the initial condition is given by @xmath19 and the boundary conditions for @xmath5 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are set to zero at infinity , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "one can easily verify that for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) becomes ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb ] ) .",
    "the physical dimensions of @xmath27 and @xmath9 for a finite number of backbones are the same as those in eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb ] ) .",
    "the case of a fractal structure of backbones will be described by an appropriate generalization of eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) .",
    "the motivation to introduce such a model is to describe the diffusion of solvents in thin porous films @xcite . such a product structure of backbones times comb is an idealization of more complex comb - like fractal networks , as they may appear , e.g. , in certain anisotropic porous media or anisotropic biological tissue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze the pdf and the msd in both directions for the force free case .",
    "anomalous diffusive behavior @xmath28 appears in the @xmath7 direction due to the comb structure of the system .",
    "general results for the msd in the case of a finite number of backbones @xmath0 are presented .",
    "we also investigate the effects of an external constant force , applied along the backbones , on the particle behavior . in sec .",
    "iii we consider an infinite number of backbones .",
    "it is shown that an infinite number of backbones , different from the case of a finite number of backbones , changes the transport exponent .",
    "deviations from the standard msd @xmath29 were observed recently in combs with ramified teeth as well , due to teeth with a fractal structure @xcite .",
    "the summary is given in sec .",
    "we apply a laplace transform ( @xmath30=\\hat{f}(s)$ ] ) to eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) , and then a fourier transform with respect to the @xmath7 ( @xmath31=\\tilde{f}(\\kappa_{x})$ ] ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath32=\\bar{f}(\\kappa_{y})$ ] ) variables .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 . from relation ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb fourier - laplace transform ] ) , the inverse fourier transform with respect to @xmath35 yields @xmath36    in the setting of a comb model , the nontrivial and interesting motion is along the backbones , i.e. , along the @xmath7 direction , while the @xmath10 direction is an auxiliary subspace .",
    "therefore , integrating the motion in the @xmath10 direction , we analyze the pdf @xmath37 . by integration of eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) with respect to @xmath10 and performing the laplace transform with respect to time @xmath38 , and the fourier transform with respect to @xmath7 , one obtains @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the pdf ( [ p1 general ] ) we calculate the msd along the @xmath7 direction by the following formula : @xmath40\\right|_{\\kappa_{x}=0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from relations ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb fourier - laplace transform inverse f ky])-([msd general ] ) for the msd we derive @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\&&=\\frac{\\mathcal{d}_{x}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{d}_{y}}}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{j}\\left[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}t^{1/2}e^{-\\frac{|l_{j}|^{2}}{4\\mathcal{d}_{y}t}}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left.-\\frac{|l_{j}|}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{d}_{y}}}\\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{|l_{j}|}{\\sqrt{4\\mathcal{d}_{y}t}}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the complementary error function @xmath43 @xcite .    for @xmath24",
    "it follows that @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the long time scale when @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the msd reads @xmath47 which means that all backbones contribute in the msd .",
    "in contrast to this , on a short time scale , when @xmath48 , @xmath46 , one finds that the main contribution in the msd is due to the first backbone , i.e. , @xmath49 this result is expected since for short times the particles move mainly in the first backbone because they had not enough time to reach the other ones by diffusion in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "this can be easily verified by considering diffusion along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "we analyze the pdf @xmath50 , for which we find that @xmath51 i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "for the msd along the @xmath10 direction one finds a linear dependence on time @xmath53 , i.e. , normal diffusion along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "therefore , the probability to find the particle at the first backbone is @xmath54 ( @xmath24 ) , while at the second backbone it is @xmath55 , and so on . since for the short time scales , @xmath56 , we conclude that the main contribution in the msd for short times is due to the displacements in the first backbone .    from relation ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n l1 - 0 ] ) for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath24 ( which means one backbone )",
    "we obtain the msd for the comblike model ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb ] ) @xmath57    these results are supported by graphical representation in fig . [ comb ] of the msd in the case of two backbones and five backbones .",
    "it is assumed that the first backbone is at @xmath13 and all the other backbones are at distances equal to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .    from relations ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact l1=0,n t->large ] ) and ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact l1=0,l->infty ] )",
    "we conclude that any finite number of backbones does not change the transport exponent in the short and long time limit . in the intermediate times",
    "there is more complicated behavior of the msd given by relation ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n l1 - 0 ] ) .",
    "the crossover time scales separating the behavior at short , intermediate , and long times are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in the presence of a constant external force @xmath64 along the backbones we arrive at the following fokker - planck equation @xmath65\\nonumber\\\\&&\\times p(x , y , t)+\\mathcal{d}_{y}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}}p(x , y , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the mobility .",
    "one can compute the first moment as a function of time , @xmath67,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by comparing it with relation ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n ] ) we conclude that the generalized einstein relation is fulfilled @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "to introduce a fractal structure of the backbones we go back to eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) and replace the summation @xmath70 with summation over a fractal set @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 , which means that the backbones are at positions @xmath10 which belong to the fractal set @xmath71 with fractal dimension @xmath73 .",
    "a simple toy example , which corresponds to an infinite fractal set , can be treated as follows . in relation (",
    "[ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n ] ) we calculate @xmath74 .",
    "one should recognize that fractal sets ( like a cantor set ) are uncountable .",
    "therefore , the last expression is purely formal and its mathematical realization corresponds to integration to fractal measure @xmath75 such that @xmath76 is the fractal density @xcite , and @xmath77 . here we note that @xmath27 is a generalized diffusion coefficient with physical dimension @xmath8=\\mathrm{m}^{3-\\nu}/\\mathrm{s}$ ] that absorbs the dimension of fractal volume or measure @xmath78 . that finally yields the following integration : @xmath79 for the msd , we obtain from ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n ] ) @xmath80 i.e. , anomalous diffusive behavior with the transport exponent equal to @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the fractal set @xmath71 of the infinite number of backbones changes the transport exponent , from @xmath2 to @xmath82 . for @xmath83",
    "the msd becomes @xmath84 , which is consistent with expectations , and for @xmath85 , we are back to the finite-@xmath0 case .",
    "indeed , the fractal dimension of any finite number of discrete points is @xmath85 .",
    "we further consider a random fractal set @xmath86 $ ] , with finite limits . from relation ( [ diffusion like eq on a comb msd exact n ] ) , in the same way as in ( [ infinite fractal mesh ] ) , for a finite integration in @xmath87 $ ] , one finds a result in the form of an incomplete @xmath88 function @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 thus , the msd becomes @xmath91 again , for @xmath83 the normal diffusive behavior along the @xmath7 direction appears , i.e. , @xmath92 .    here",
    "we note that the result for the msd ( [ msd infinite fractal mesh ] ) can be obtained in the framework of fractional integration as well . by integration of eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) over @xmath10 and using the summation on the fractal set as above in this section , for the pdf @xmath93 one obtains @xmath94 the laplace transform to ( [ p1 fractal ] ) yields @xmath95 by representing the solution @xmath96 in the following way : @xmath97",
    ", i.e. , @xmath98 , for the @xmath99 we find @xmath100 from the other side , by using the previous approach of summation , we have @xmath101 by substituting relation ( [ summation p lj ] ) in ( [ p1 fractal laplace ] ) , we obtain @xmath102 from this , the inverse laplace transform yields the following time fractional diffusion equation : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the caputo time fractional derivative of order @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "from here we easily obtain the msd @xmath105 that is of form ( [ msd infinite fractal mesh ] ) . the solution for the pdf @xmath93",
    "can be represented in terms of the fox @xmath106 function @xmath107 @xcite , @xmath108,\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the generalized diffusion coefficient with physical dimension @xmath110=\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{(1+\\nu)/2}$ ] .",
    "therefore , as shown , the infinite number of backbones changes the transport exponent .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath93 ( [ p1 fractal structure ] ) for @xmath111 is of the form @xcite :    @xmath112,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    i.e. , it has non - gaussian behavior . for @xmath83",
    "it turns to gaussian behavior as it is expected and as it was shown by analysis of the msd .    additionally to the msd we calculate the @xmath113th moment @xmath114 thus for the fourth moment it follows that @xmath115 the calculation of the fourth moment is useful to discriminate subdiffusive processes with identical msds , e.g. , subdiffusion due to different fractal structures or different mechanisms @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for the even moments we obtain @xmath116 from which we can find the following interesting relation : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the one parameter mittag - leffler function @xcite",
    "finally , we show how the fractal structure @xmath71 relates to the fractional riesz derivative @xcite .",
    "let us consider the fractal structure of backbones in eq.([diffusion like eq on a comb two delta ] ) separately . in the fourier - fourier @xmath119 space it reads @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the weierstrass function @xcite .",
    "it can be obtained by the following procedure @xcite : let us use @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "thus @xmath125 now @xmath126 and @xmath127 are dimensionless scale parameters .",
    "therefore @xmath128 where @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , and for convenience , we choose @xmath131 . from here",
    "one obtains @xmath132 neglecting the last term since @xmath124 , therefore the scaling @xmath133 means that @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the fractal dimension .",
    "thus , for relation ( [ eq in ff space ] ) we have @xmath136 this integration is the riesz fractional derivative @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce a diffusion equation for a comb structure where the displacements in the @xmath7 direction are possible along many backbones , even an infinite number of backbones , and we call this system by grid comb . we analyze the msd and we show that by adding a finite number of backbones , the transport exponent in the long time limit does not change . differently from that",
    ", an infinite number of backbones changes the transport exponent . considering a fractal structure of backbones with fractal dimension @xmath137 we obtained the dependence of the transport exponent on @xmath137 .",
    "we stress that the performed analysis is exact  more precisely , that the evaluation of the contribution of the fractal structure @xmath71 to anomalous diffusion is exact .",
    "note that the first attempt to take into account a fractal structure of traps was performed in @xcite in the framework of a coarse graining procedure of the fokker - planck equation that leads to the fractional differentiation in the real space .",
    "in contrast to that , in the present analysis we are able to perform an exact analysis for the fractal structure @xmath71 .",
    "this also relates to exact fractional differentiation in the reciprocal fourier space .    in conclusion",
    ", it should be admitted that a comb model is a toy model that can be solved exactly and establishes a relation between geometry and the transport exponent .",
    "as is recently found it also corresponds to the real physical realization in experiments on calcium transport in spiny dendrites ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the grid - comb model , suggested here as the generalization of the comb model , establishes an exact relation between a complicated fractal geometry and the transport exponent as well . another strong motivation of the model , also related to the result , is that in the framework of this model it is possible to infer an exactly fractional derivative related to fractal geometry .",
    "all these points are important for the understanding of anomalous transport in heterogeneous material , in particular to describe diffusion of solvents in thin porous films @xcite , or in another two - dimensional material like graphene @xcite .",
