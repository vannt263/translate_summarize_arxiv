    "the optoelectronic properties of 2d transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) monolayers are dominated by excitons  @xcite . distinguishing features of the excitons in 2d metal dichalcogenides are the large exciton binding energies and the strong exciton - photon interactions  @xcite .",

    "it is satisfying to note that the former result corresponds to the classical inverse square law for radiative energy transfer and the latter corresponds to the standard forster s result for non - radiative energy transfer via dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite . in the longitudinal case ,",
    "if one integrates the energy transfer rate over the in - plane position @xmath170 of the final exciton state , then the total energy transfer rate will scale as @xmath185 with the interlayer separation .",
    "in many cases of practical interest where the optical bandgaps and/or the exciton binding energies in two different tmd monolayers are very different , the energy transfer can be from the excitons in the wider bandgap tmd layer to the free electron - hole pairs in the narrower bandgap tmd layer .",

    "given the number of possible final states ( corresponding to different values of @xmath20 ) and the fast electron and hole scattering rates in tmds , we do nt expect coherent oscillations .",
    "assuming that the narrower bandgap material is in the ground state with a full valence band and an empty conduction band , the energy transfer times can be expressed as , @xmath200 where @xmath201 , and @xmath202 when @xmath203 outside the light cone . here , @xmath204 is the joint density of states for the creation of free electron - hole pairs ( per valley / spin ) in layer @xmath78 . again",

    "2 .   in plotting all the results ,",
    "a momentum - independent exciton fwhm linewidth was used .",

    ", on the exciton scattering rates , a quantitative theory or experimental data for momentum - dependent exciton scattering rate in tmds is needed for a better understanding of the dependence of the energy transfer rates on exciton momenta .",
    "it is well known that radiation emission and absorption rates are affected by the presence of dielectric interfaces  @xcite .",
    "most experiments on tmd layers are performed with the layers placed on dielectric substrates .",
    "the influence of nearby dielectrics would need to be taken into account in comparing theory with experiments .",

    "in this section , we calculate the exciton self - energy in tmd monolayers . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the resulting dressed green s functions @xmath215 can be expressed in a form that will be useful later , @xmath216 the denominator on the right hand side in the above equations is generally small and may be neglected .",
    "but it plays an important role when off - shell exciton self - energies are desired , as shown below .",
    "the green s functions for the radiation field are gauge - dependent .",
    "it is convenient to choose the temporal gauge in which the scalar potential is set equal to zero ( and need not be taken into account separately )  @xcite .",
    "henceforth , all results will be given for the temporal gauge .",
    "the dyson equation for the exciton green s function is , @xmath217    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the retarded self - energies are found to be , @xmath218 the dressed exciton green s functions become , @xmath219         } { ( \\hbar\\omega)^{2}-e_{ex,\\alpha}(\\vec{q}_{\\parallel})^{2 } - 2\\frac{(\\hbar \\omega)^{2}}{e_{ex,\\alpha}(\\vec{q}_{\\parallel } ) } \\sigma^{or}_{\\vec{q}_{\\parallel},l / t,\\alpha}(\\omega ) } \\nonumber \\\\    & \\approx & \\frac{2e_{ex,\\alpha}(\\vec{q}_{\\parallel})}{(\\hbar\\omega)^{2}-e_{ex,\\alpha}(\\vec{q}_{\\parallel})^{2 } - 2\\frac{(\\hbar \\omega)^{2}}{e_{ex,\\alpha}(\\vec{q}_{\\parallel } ) } \\sigma^{or}_{\\vec{q}_{\\parallel},l / t,\\alpha}(\\omega ) } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath129 is the same as @xmath220 given in ( [ eq : self ] ) above except that the bare radiation green s function @xmath221 is used in place of @xmath215 .",
    "finally the exciton spectral density function @xmath222 can be related to the retarded green s function as follows , @xmath223    when @xmath130 ( inside the light cone ) , both the self - energies @xmath220 have a vanishingly small real part and a large magnitude of the imaginary part .",
    "the latter corresponds to the radiative lifetime of the exciton .",
    "the situation is reversed when @xmath224 and then the magnitude of the real part of the self - energy becomes large and the imaginary part vanishes .",
    "therefore , when @xmath225 ( inside the light cone ) one can ignore corrections to the exciton dispersion , and the radiative lifetime of the exciton can be related to the imaginary part of the self - energy evaluated on the shell , @xmath226 and , we get  @xcite , @xmath227 when @xmath224 and the self - energies are real , we get  @xcite , @xmath228 note that the corrections obtained from @xmath214 , which was quadratic in the vector potential , are important for obtaining the correct expressions for the exciton self - energies far off - shell .",
    "the exciton self - energy expressions given above can be used to obtain energy dispersions , @xmath229 , for the longitudinal and transverse excitons .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : figa1 ] for the lowest energy ( @xmath101 ) exciton state in a suspended mos@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "we define @xmath104 by the equation @xmath230 .",
    "the dispersion for the transverse exciton consists of two curves ( corresponding to the distinct poles of the green s function ) .",
    "the upper curve has all the spectral weight for @xmath231 and the lower curve gets all the weight when @xmath232 , and the spectral weight shifts from the upper curve to the lower curve around @xmath233 .",
    "the dispersion for the longitudinal exciton consists of only a single curve and the energy dispersion is linear in @xmath103 for @xmath232 . for @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , in a thermal ensemble of excitons , transverse exciton density is expected to exceed the longitudinal exciton density .",
    "note that there are negligibly small corrections to the exciton dispersion within the light cone for both the transverse and longitudinal excitons .",
