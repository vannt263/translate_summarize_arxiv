    "in research fields ranging from ecology and epidemiology to sociology , it is important to clarify the effect of the interactions among species or phenotypes on the entire system .",
    "stochastic interacting particle systems , in which each site on a graph takes either of the possible states and is flipped according to the states of other sites , are a useful tool for this purpose .",
    "a paradigmatic interacting particle system that describes disease spreading is the contact process ( cp ; also termed the susceptible - infected - susceptible model ) @xcite .",
    "various interacting particle systems in complex networks have been investigated recently @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in an ecological context , organisms of different scales can be considered to live in a two - dimensional space , often with a small interaction range .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to study models that are more complex than the cp on the euclidean lattice @xcite .",
    "a simple extension of the cp in this direction is a three - state spatial host - parasite ( hp ) model that deals with an ecosystem comprising soil ( empty sites ) , host species living on soil , and pathogen species ( parasites ) living on hosts .",
    "phase transitions and oscillations in similar models have been studied from the perspective of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "sat et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the hp model on a square lattice .",
    "they showed by means of the improved - pair approximation ( i - pa ) and numerical simulations that a very high reproduction rate of parasites results in the extinction of both hosts and parasites .",
    "this phenomenon is called parasite - driven extinction @xcite .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this paradoxical behavior is that parasites replace hosts so quickly that hosts get extinct , which eventually results in the extinction of parasites .",
    "a similar paradoxical behavior , i.e. , a decrease in the number of a species caused by an increase in its fertility , is observed in other models , where a sort of rock - scissors - paper competition is prevalent among three species @xcite .",
    "the current understanding of the phase diagram of the hp model is not comprehensive , because parasite - driven extinction can not be predicted by mean field approximation and pair approximation ( pa ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically investigate the phase diagram of the hp model on the square lattice .",
    "in particular , we use large lattices and investigate the effect of the system size on parasite - driven extinction .",
    "the obtained phase diagram is shown in fig .",

    "we argue that two transition boundaries ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "another transition boundary ( dotted lines ) is not characterized by the dp universality class , and its location depends on the system size .",

    "the hp model on the square lattice @xmath6 is defined as a continuous - time markov process with state space @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "each site takes one of the three states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which represent an empty site , a host , and a parasite , respectively .",
    "the rules for the state transition are depicted in fig .",

    "we vary the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the numerical simulations .",
    "because parasites feed on hosts , the hp model allows the following three phases in the stationary state :    ( i ) : :    phase @xmath0 , in which hosts and parasites are extinct , ( ii ) : :    phase @xmath1 , in which hosts survive and parasites are    extinct , and ( iii ) : :    phase @xmath2 , in which both hosts and parasites    survive .     denotes the number of neighbors of a site in state @xmath13.,width=226 ]    the hp model with @xmath20",

    "are realized when @xmath18 is respectively smaller and larger than @xmath24 @xcite .",
