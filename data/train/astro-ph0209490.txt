    "the installation of the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope has brought us the discovery of a new population of faint submillimeter sources @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "the far - infrared background ( firb ) was detected with the far infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on the cobe satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the firb is comparable to or larger than that in the optical wavelengths , and much of it could be explained by integrating individual submillimeter sources down to the faintest limit @xcite .",
    "thus , it is indispensable to investigate the faint submillimeter population in order to understand overall history of energy production in the universe .",
    "although scuba has unveiled the faint submillimeter population , its beam is too broad ( 15 fwhm at 850@xmath0 m ) to pinpoint their optical counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high density of the submillimeter sources also raises a problem of source confusion @xcite . up until now",
    ", methods to bypass the broad submillimeter beam have included centimetric radio interferometry with vla @xcite and millimetric interferometry with iram or ovro @xcite .",
    "most recently , an attempt to observe at a longer wavelength has started at the iram 30 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the larger dish provides a slightly smaller beam ( 10 at 1.3 mm ) .",
    "here we investigate the identification of scuba sources with a mid - infrared deep image having a relatively small beam ( 72 at 6.7@xmath0 m ) .",
    "faint submillimeter sources , presumably dusty systems at high redshifts , could be bright in the mid - infrared regardless of their energy sources .",
    "if the submillimeter emission was produced by dust heated by star forming activity , there should be stellar systems following the stellar initial mass function .",
    "the stellar systems could be luminous at the rest - frame near - infrared ( @xmath6 m ) even in the presence of dust . in the case that the source was powered by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , very hot dust surrounding the agn could emit its reprocessed energy at @xmath7 m . for both cases",
    ", the emitted light could be received at the mid - infrared , even though the sources were at high redshifts .",
    "a sensitive mid - infrared camera isocam @xcite on board the infrared space observatory ( iso , * ? ? ? * ) provided us with the first opportunity to identify faint submillimeter sources at the mid - infrared . in the hawaii deep field ssa13",
    ", a very deep mid - infrared map was obtained with the lw2 ( 6.7@xmath0 m ) filter ( @xcite ) .",
    "this field was also surveyed extensively with scuba ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : id ] , we plot both 6.7@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m sources detected within the scuba field - of - view .",
    "all three 850@xmath0 m sources ; a , b , and c ( these identifiers are used throughout this paper ; table  [ tab : id ] ) are found to be located very close to certain 6.7@xmath0 m sources .",
    "monte carlo simulations of source detection suggest that displacement of the detected position as large as the beam size could happen in low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) ranges @xcite .",
    "we estimate the probability of random alignments between the 6.7@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m sources .",
    "as the surface density of 6.7@xmath0 m sources at this depth is larger than that of 850@xmath0 m sources , we assume a poisson distribution for 6.7@xmath0 m sources .",
    "then , the chance alignment probability can be defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance between 6.7@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m sources and @xmath10 is a 6.7@xmath0 m integral number count at the flux of the corresponding 6.7@xmath0 m source .",
    "the chance probability became only @xmath11 , 16 , and 4.1% for sources a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "then , we associate the closest 6.7@xmath0 m sources with the corresponding submillimeter sources .",
    "the optical counterparts of the sources were identified in deep @xmath12 images taken with the wfpc2 f814w filter @xcite .",
    "interacting galaxy pairs were found at the peaks of the 6.7@xmath0 m contours for all the 850@xmath0 m sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : id ] ) .",
    "the occurrence of an irregular morphology is consistent with the results of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) discovered with iras @xcite . within 1 from all the optical counterparts ,",
    "faint 1.4ghz sources are detected ( e.  a.  richards 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "source b also has a hard x - ray ( 210kev ) detection with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the small rate of agns in submillimeter sources ( 1/3 ) is similar to the previous results @xcite .",
    "magnitudes at the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 bands were measured with additional data taken from the ground @xcite .",
    "two of the three sources are optically faint and very red ( table  [ tab : id ] ) . here",
    "are notes for the individual sources .",
    "* a ) * this is the most significant scuba detection in this sample ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the isocam contour reduces the uncertainty of the scuba position . in the middle of the 6.7@xmath0 m contour",
    ", there is a faint ( @xmath17 ) interacting galaxy pair having a very red color of @xmath2 . *",
    "b ) * one of the 6.7@xmath0 m peaks matches a colliding galaxy pair with @xmath18 and @xmath2 .",
    "the isocam source appears somewhat extended probably due to confusion of faint sources .",
    "* c ) * a bright merger ( @xmath19 ) with tidal tails is located at the edge of the beam centered at the nominal scuba position .",
    "the original scuba image shows a sign of elongation , suggesting a lower position accuracy ( fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the three scuba sources detected at 6.7@xmath0 m share the same observational properties as those of local uligs ; i.e. an irregular morphology , a red color , and optical and x - ray faintness .",
    "therefore it seems possible to estimate their redshifts with an assumption that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are similar to that of arp220 , an archetypal ulig in the local universe .",
    "we adopt a uv to submillimeter sed in the grasil library to represent arp220 @xcite . applying a convolution with two bandpass filters at 850@xmath0 m and 6.7@xmath0 m , we derived flux ratios @xmath20(850@xmath0m)/@xmath20(6.7@xmath0 m ) as a function of redshift ( upper left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : redshift ] ) .",
    "because of a monotonic increase with redshift , this relation can be used to estimate redshifts , analogous to the redshift estimator based on a submillimeter to radio flux ratio @xcite .",
    "the derived estimates were in the range @xmath212 ( table  [ tab : z ] ) .",
    "the reconstructed seds are consistent with other photometry data , suggesting the usefulness of this redshift estimator ( fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift ] ) .    with the identification results",
    "above , we could omit the assumption of an arp220 sed to obtain photometric redshifts .",
    "other estimates @xmath22(sed ) were derived via @xmath4 minimization between all the photometry data and sed templates .",
    "we here adopt the grasil sed library @xcite ; uv to submillimeter seds of local templates ( starbursts : m82 , ngc6090 , and arp220 , normal galaxies : m51 , m100 , and ngc6946 , and a giant elliptical ) and uv to radio seds of evolving e , sa , sb , and sc galaxies .",
    "we add an x - ray to radio sed of a heavily obscured agn ngc6240 compiled by @xcite . the best scaling factor for",
    "a certain sed at each redshift was determined by minimizing @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 value was summed up at the wavelengths where the model predictions could be evaluated .",
    "upper limits were used as restrictions .",
    "thus , the number of degrees of freedom is the number of detections ( within the wavelength range of the sed ) minus one ( for a scaling factor ) .",
    "the smallest reduced @xmath4 was achieved with the arp220 sed for sources a and b , and with the 13gyr sc sed for source c. the resulting @xmath23(sed)-values are similar to @xmath24 .",
    "a spectroscopic redshift of source c was measured as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "a millimetric redshift of @xmath26 was derived for source b @xcite .",
    "all of these are consistent in the range @xmath52 ( table  [ tab : z ] ) .",
    "source c gives a minimum @xmath4 at @xmath27 for many seds including the arp220 sed .",
    "the hard x - ray flux for the @xmath3 source b was not used in the @xmath4 calculations except in the case with the ngc6240 sed .",
    "an overall fit to the hard x - ray to radio data turned out to not be so good ; the ngc6240 sed suggests @xmath28 but with a reduced @xmath29 .",
    "( cf . fig .  11 in",
    "if we admit such a level of reduced @xmath4 , there could be some room for a higher redshift for the optically faint sources a and b. source a could be at @xmath30 with the 0.8gyr e sed ( a reduced @xmath31 ) .",
    "for source b , the 0.2gyr e sed gives @xmath32 with a reduced @xmath33 ( for the uv to radio data only ) .",
    "both e seds represent a dusty elliptical before the galactic wind blows .",
    "we identified source c with a galaxy offsetting 64 from the nominal scuba position .",
    "such sizes of offsets were observed in simulations of the source detection in a crowded field @xcite .",
    "scuba observations of radio selected sources actually found such offsets at the submillimeter flux level of 24mjy with @xmath345 @xcite .",
    "the expected large offsets and optical faintness suggest that the mid - infrared identification of scuba sources could be an effective way to find their optical counterparts . for the submillimeter sample presented here , their counterparts are as faint as 14@xmath0jy at 6.7@xmath0 m , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "integral galaxy counts at the corresponding depths are @xmath37 deg@xmath38 , @xmath39 deg@xmath38 , and @xmath40 deg@xmath38 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the probability of finding spurious associations by chance would be smaller by a factor of 38 at 6.7@xmath0 m .",
    "our isocam map taken with a pixel field of view ( pfov ) of 6 still has a low resolution problem .",
    "the 6.7@xmath0 m contour for source c extends to the east to include an edge - on spiral .",
    "the extended appearance is also seen for source b. although their fluxes were corrected to be one point source statistically @xcite , effects of the extension to the corrected flux for a particular source remain uncertain . a mid - infrared imaging with a finer pfov ( 12 ) with sirtf / irac or astro - f / irc would clarify such ambiguities .",
    "the high sensitivity of these detectors will also strengthen redshift estimates for the milli - jansky 850@xmath0 m sources .",
    "they can be detected even at @xmath41 , and their redshifts could be determined , provided that the arp220 sed is a representative for them . for cases of other seds , multi - band mid - infrared fluxes should be required to estimate photometric redshifts because such high redshift sources are likely to be faint in the optical , or even in the near - infrared .",
    "the estimated range of redshift for the three sources in the ssa13 field is @xmath42 = 12 . given a cosmology with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the sources would be 24 times more luminous than arp220 .",
    "these properties are similar to other submillimeter sources @xcite .",
    "a simple scaling of the model parameters for the grasil arp220 sed gives star formation rates in the range ( 12 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 and stellar masses in the range ( 37 ) @xmath45 @xmath47 .",
    "while the peak of the dust emission was not observed directly , the 6.7@xmath0 m flux originated from the rest - frame near - infrared .",
    "because rest - frame near - infrared emission has a good correlation with stellar mass , it would be accurate to assume that these submillimeter sources have massive stellar populations in them . with signs of a major merger in all the optical counterparts , similar to",
    "the irregular morphologies already reported @xcite , it is suggested that less massive galaxies identified at @xmath48 @xcite would evolve into local massive galaxies via major merging with the submillimeter bright phase .",
    "all three of the faint 850@xmath0 m sources ( 24mjy ) in the scuba ssa13 deep field have been found to have isocam 6.7@xmath0 m counterparts ( 1030@xmath0jy ) . utilizing the smaller beam size at 6.7@xmath0 m",
    ", we find that all the three sources are coincident with interacting galaxy pairs in the @xmath12 @xmath14 band images .",
    "they all have vla 1.4ghz counterparts , and only one of them is detected with @xmath3 at the 210kev band . based on the properties similar to local uligs , we used submillimeter to mid - infrared flux ratios to estimate photometric redshifts .",
    "we derived other photometric redshifts utilizing the x - ray to radio photometry data .",
    "both estimates are consistent with a spectroscopic redshift and a millimetric one .",
    "an arp220 sed at @xmath52 provides a good fit to the available data . with an assumption that agn contributions are negligible , the implied sfrs are in the range ( 12 ) @xmath45 @xmath46 and",
    "the mid - infrared emission requires stellar masses in the range ( 37 ) @xmath45 @xmath47 .",
