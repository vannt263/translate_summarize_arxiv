    "however , the comparison with other soft x - ray transients may be misleading since it is unclear whether the accretion mechanism is the same in all cases . the hard spectrum observed in 1999 means that at times there may be sufficient hard x - ray photons to trigger the mass loss instability of hameury et al .",

    "the non - detection in the 2000 observation may then result from an extremely low accretion rate far from the companion star .",
