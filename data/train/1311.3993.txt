    "evidence of mechanical feedback is also detected in optical lines from ionized gas , with shock velocities @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our observations include herschel fourier transform spectrometer ( spire - fts ) spectroscopy obtained as part of the `` beyond the peak '' ( btp ; ot1_jsmith1 ; pi j.d .",

    "btp provides deep , intermediate spaced mapping of a large collection of nearby galaxies at @xmath0co transitions above j=(3 - 2 ) .",
    "ngc  1266 has been imaged in [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] emission lines as part the herschel key program kingfish @xcite .",
    "the data were using the kingfish pipeline for pacs spectroscopy in hipe v9.0.3063 using the calibration files in pacs calversion 41 , following the methods described in @xcite .",
    "all spire - fts observations use a 4-point dither which sub - critically samples extended emission with an internal jiggle mirror . our data are calibrated with hipe v10 using an extended - flux calibration .",
    "the default pipeline includes a central , unjiggled telescope response function ( rsrf ) created from thousands of repetitions of dark observations .",
    "we calculate new jiggled rsrfs from @xmath13 repetitions of jiggled darks , now available in hipe  v11 . for dark subtraction",
    ", we use the un - jiggled deep darks obtained during the same fts observing run and fit a high - order polynomial to each bolometer .",
    "while ngc  1266 is a compact source , the slw bolometer beam size and dither pattern produce repeat , but off - center slw observations of our target . at this time , dithered calibrations have only been obtained for extended sources . to calibrate these dithered observations we begin with the jiggle-0 ( undithered ) spectrum , processed with the point - source pipeline .",
    "next all data were re - processed as with mapped calibrations , and an average spectrum was created by weighting individual slw bolometers with the projected overlap of the beam profile and a 20  aperture centered on the peak of the spire 250@xmath2 image @xcite .",
    "we ratio the mapped and point source spectra to create a transfer function to calibrate the dithered observations while simultaneously accounting for the beam filling factor of a point source .",
    "off target bolometers also sample ample sky around ngc  1266 and we find no continuum or line emission , and thus perform no background subtraction .",
    "the resulting spectrum ( figure [ fig : spirespec ] ) shows prominent lines of [ ] , [ ] , 10 transitions of @xmath0co , and 7 transitions of h@xmath14o .",
    "we measure emission line fluxes from the unapodized spectrum using sinc profiles with a variable spectral width . due to outflows we allow line central velocities to vary up to 100 km / s from the systematic velocity .",
    "the line fluxes and errors associated with the continuum uncertainty are listed in table [ tab : fluxes ] , which also includes ground based measurements of @xmath0coj=(1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) from @xcite .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath1 lines from spitzer irs , we also add nir 1 - 0 s(1 ) h@xmath1 fluxes from @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : fluxes ] line fluxes are extinction corrected using the pahfit fully - mixed geometry decomposition of ngc  1266 s low resolution irs spectroscopy , which yielded a silicate opacity @xmath15 .",
    "the correction if we adopt a screen geometry is negligibly different .",
    "we consider energy sources that are capable of powering the emission from the central 100  pc of ngc  1266 : an agn and sf .",
    "x - ray emission from an obscured agn could produce an xdr , while star - formation would produce a pdr .",
    "both phenomena are also capable of driving shocks , which would mechanically heat the gas .",
    "however , we emphasize that the dominance of one heating mechanism does not preclude the presence of the other .        motivated by shocks detected in optical lines , and molecular outflows , we first consider shocked gas as the source of co excitation . to fit the co sled , we form combinations of the j- and/or c - shock models from @xcite .",
    "we then fit these to observations after normalization by total intensity from j=(1 - 0 ) to ( 13 - 12 ) according to @xmath16 where the @xmath17 model contributes a fraction @xmath18 to the total predicted co intensity , with a minimum @xmath18=0.01 and @xmath19 .    with a large reservoir of dense gas",
    "we expect some level of star - formation in ngc  1266 .",
    "the observed tir emission is consistent with sf@xmath20  2.1/yr @xcite .",
    "so we consider combinations of shock and plane - parallel pdr models .",
    "to estimate the emission from pdrs , we adopt the models of @xcite , with updates in @xcite .",
    "note that we adopted the shock and pdr models with solar abundance as calculated .",
    "we do not include the 60/100@xmath2 ratio from the dust sed as a constraint due to uncertainties in the optical depth of the dust emission .",
    "however , we do constrain @xmath21 not to exceed the observed ratio , based upon the assumption that shocks do not contribute appreciably to @xmath22 and that a single face - on pdr contributes a continuum with an intensity related to the far - uv radiation field @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "a pdr fits the lowest - j co lines with @xmath25  @xmath26 , @xmath27 , while c - shocks fit the higher - j lines with @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30  @xmath26 ( reduced @xmath31 ) .",
    "the best fitting combination of the existing models are shown in figure [ fig : cosled]a with a solid line ( black ) , as well as the individual pdr  ( blue ) and shock  ( red ) components .",
    "model parameter probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) are shown on the right .",
    "the ngc  1266 h@xmath14osled is also shown top - right . although it was not used as an input , the best - fit model reproduces it well , including the faint high temperature transitions .",
    "the shock under - predicts the [ ]  63@xmath2 , but the [ ] intensity varies strongly with shock parameters .",
    "a small contribution from a 10  km / s shock we would explain the observed [ o  i ] intensity .",
    "a dual pdr model ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) could equally well explain the @xmath0coand h@xmath1 excitation and relative intensity .",
    "we reject the dual - pdr scenario because it requires @xmath36 , resulting in @xmath37 lower than that observed .",
    "@xcite similarly rejected a dual pdr in ngc  6240 based on this argument . in ngc  1266 , a dual pdr under - predicts @xmath38 , and",
    "hence over - predicts @xmath39 , by 3 orders of magnitude . with @xmath40 constrained to @xmath41 , the resulting reduced @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "thus a two component pdrs is rejected as the sole source of the molecular emission .",
    "the rosat x - ray flux of @xmath44 from 0.2 - 2.0  kev @xcite could also indicate an xdr contribution to @xmath0coand the h@xmath14olines detected in our spectrum .",
    "we will fully explore the possible contribution of xdrs in our full survey , which includes 10 agn , in a future paper .",
    "however , an xdr is unlikely to dominate the @xmath0coemission in ngc  1266 .",
    "first , xdrs produce high ionization fractions in molecular gas leading to @xmath45 and oh@xmath46 emission with comparable intensities to h@xmath14olines ( @xcite ) , yet no emission from these molecules is detected .",
    "we do detect absorption from @xmath47 , but this has been seen in systems where xdr are ruled out ( e.g. arp220 , @xcite ) .",
    "second , @xmath38 also eliminates xdrs as the dominant heating source in ngc  1266 .",
    "the efficiency at which x - rays are converted to line emission and ir continuum is very different than in shocks which heat gas but are relatively inefficient at heating dust .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : tirco ] , a plot of @xmath38 against @xmath48}$ ] and @xmath49 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , xdr and pdr models have an upper limit on the line - to - continuum ratio of @xmath50 , represented by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : tirco ] . in ngc  1266",
    "that ratio for the 13 detected co lines is nearly @xmath51 , just below that of ngc  6240 ( see figure  [ fig : tirco ] ) .",
    "@xcite found that the observed @xmath52 ratio was 3 times larger than could explained by an xdr .",
    "the ratio of @xmath48}$ ] is also enhanced by an order of magnitude in ngc  1266 , as in ngc  6240 .",
    "the linearity of [ ] with @xmath0co , seen in figure  [ fig : tirco ] , suggests it is a powerful diagnostic especially useful where the entire @xmath0cois not observable , as is the case with high redshift galaxies observed with alma .

    "@xmath80 is the optical depth of ir radiation , weighted by the momentum of each photon , which we conservatively take to be unity .",
    "@xmath81 is the width of the gas velocity distribution . adopting the core co line widths of 100  km / s , we find @xmath82  .",
    "thus , given uncertainties in @xmath80 and @xmath83 , a sf of 2.1/yr could sustain the energetics of the derived shocks indefinitely .",
