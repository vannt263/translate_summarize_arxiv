    "geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets have been an extremely fruitful subject in condensed matter physics due to the various non - trivial macroscopic degeneracies originating from competing magnetic interactions and low dimensionality .",
    "a typical example of this state of matter is the widely studied low - temperature magnetism of two - dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnets ( 2d - tla ) .",
    "one such system is cucro@xmath0 , where layers of edge - shared cro@xmath2 octahedra , with the magnetic cr@xmath3 ions forming a triangular lattice , are separated by layers of nonmagnetic cu@xmath4 ions @xcite such that there is little magnetic coupling between the cr layers .",
    "the octahedral environment of the cr@xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) ions leads to a quenched orbital moment and total spin of 3/2 since the @xmath6 orbitals are each half filled .",
    "a ` proper helix ' magnetic ground state with a propagation vector * q * = ( 0.329 , 0.329 , 0 ) occurs below t@xmath7 k , which is close to a classical 120@xmath1 ordering @xcite .    despite its well - known magnetic properties and earlier reports of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments , the complete spin hamiltonian of cucro@xmath0 is still unresolved .",
    "one reason is due to some contradictory observations in the various ins studies .",
    "for instance , evidence for a flat 5 mev magnon - mode at the zone center is given in @xcite .",
    "however , this mode is clearly absent in the more recent work of kajimoto et .",
    "al , @xcite as well as in this work .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the difference in energy resolution between the experiments .",
    "taken together , these observations negate the need to introduce an overly large single - ion anisotropy ( sia ) in order to explain the unusual downward shift in the 5 mev mode at the zone boundary as was previously done . instead",
    ", we show that this and other features of the data can be readily explained by taking into account the effects of a magnon - phonon coupling .    making use of new ins measurements on cucro@xmath0 single crystals ,",
    "we have determined accurately the two key places where there are extra features in the observed spectra when compared to a pure heisenberg model : ( 1 ) an additional intensity below t@xmath8 in the phonon mode at 12.5 mev , ( 2 ) a minimum of the magnon dispersion at the zone boundary . in order to explain these two discrepancies , we present a refined model using the exchange - striction mechanism to account for a magnon - phonon coupling arising from the non - collinear magnetic structure in this compound .",
    "our data also reveal a continuum excitation in the magnon - phonon spectrum above the single magnon modes .",
    "we will discuss this continuum excitation and show that it orginates from the magnon - magnon interaction as well as the possible mixing of phonon and magnon modes .",
    "cucro@xmath0 is a member of the delafossite ( cufeo@xmath0 ) family with space group r@xmath9 m , a @xmath10 2.97 and c @xmath10 17.10  @xcite . for this experiment ,",

    "four single crystals of total mass @xmath12 0.8 g were co - aligned on an aluminum sample holder by super glue with mosaicity of less than 1@xmath1 .",
    "these samples were mounted in the scattering plane ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) such that the wave vector of the form @xmath13 = ( h , k , 0 ) reciprocal lattice unit is accessible in the horizontal plane .    our ins experiment was carried out on the taipan thermal triple - axis spectrometer @xcite at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation ( ansto ) , australia .",

    "a pyrolytic graphite filter was mounted between the sample and analyzer .",
    "the samples were loaded inside the bottom - loading cryofurnace cf-1 , and measurements were made at its base temperature of 5 k to get a clear picture of the magnetic excitations .",
    "additional scans at 50 and 300 k were carried out to investigate the temperature dependence of the phonon mode .",

    "the overall shape of the single - magnon spectrum below 8 mev is consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , as stated above , we did not observe the flat mode at 5 mev near the zone center ( c and c@xmath15 point ) reported earlier .",
    "rather in our data , the weak scattering at the zone center appears to originate from the long tail of the elastic signal .",
    "these data are also in good agreement with the data presented in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large sia required to produce this flat mode is unlikely since only a small easy - plane anisotropy value is required to stabilise the observed magnetic structure , and this small anisotropy has little effect on the calculated magnon spectrum .",
    "even though there is a small component of an incommensurate magnetic structure present , the magnetic ground state of cucro@xmath0 can be well approximated by a classical 120@xmath1 ordered state which is typical in a heisenberg tla .",
    "therefore , to maintain reasonable simplicity in our modeling , we neglect all of the interactions that are associated with the incommensurate magnetic structure of cucro@xmath0 , i.e. the interlayer coupling or the anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "this is done in order to focus on fitting the overall shape of the magnon dispersion in @xmath17 space .",
    "thus , as a starting point for analyzing the data , the following minimal heisenberg hamiltonian is utilized : @xmath18 where sums run over nearest neighbor ( nn ) , next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) and third - nearest neighbor ( tnn ) .",

    "whilst the simplified model @xmath22 reproduces the overall dispersion and intensities well , large differences at the b point , @xmath23 , are apparent , including a clearly defined minimum in the measured dispersion which is absent in the calculation .",
    "we note that by increasing j@xmath0/j@xmath19 up to 1/6 or higher , the lower energy magnon mode can be flattened .",
    "however , analysis of the magnetic ground state points out that the classical 120@xmath1 ordering can be stabilized without other coupling only if j@xmath0/j@xmath19 is less than 1/8 @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the minimum at the b - point is the higher order ( 1/s ) correction to lswt which theoretical studies @xcite show can produce a pronounce downwards renormalization of the spin wave energies .",
    "however , mourigal et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for the s=3/2 case , this renormalisation is just 8% of the lswt energies due to the large value of s. we previously observed similarly small 1/s corrections in our data for lumno@xmath21 with s=2 @xcite . in cucro@xmath0 , though , this mechanism is insufficient to account for the observed minimum , motivating us to explore alternative spin hamiltonians .      besides the single - magnon spectrum , a flat phonon mode near 12.5 mev was identified in our data .",
    "[ fig3](d ) shows the integrated neutron intensity from 12.5 to 13 mev at three temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a - c ) . a phonon population ( bose ) factor correction was applied to ensure that the data at 50 and 300 k could be compared directly to the 5 k data .",
    "no difference in this phonon intensity along the [ h , h , 0 ] direction is observed above t@xmath8 ( 50 and 300 k ) and the intensity of the phonon mode has the usual @xmath24 dependence , as shown by the dotted line in fig . [ fig3](d ) .",
    "strikingly though , there is a clear difference between the @xmath13-dependence of this phonon intensity at 5 k compared to the higher temperatures : a gaussian - like signal with center at the b point ( see the lower plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) ) .",
    "since this additional intensity emerges below the magnetic ordering temperature , it can be readily inferred that the magnetic order is strongly related to this phonon mode",
    ".    many previous studies on the magneto - elastic properties in cucro@xmath0 also give motivation to devise a new hamiltonian that incorporates a magnon - phonon coupling .",
    "for example , x - ray diffraction and strain gauge measurement studies reported strong deformation of the triangular lattice plane below t@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "also , ultrasound velocity measurements show the softening of the transverse acoustic phonon which accompanies the ferroelastic transition below t@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the temperature dependence of shifts in certain raman - active peaks @xcite reveals that the frequency of the e@xmath25 mode falls below t@xmath26 in contrast with the a@xmath27 mode , which remains constant .",
    "these data implies that the coupling between the magnetic order and each phonon mode can vary , i.e. a specific lattice vibration mode can strongly interact with the magnetic structure .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the direct exchange interaction between cr@xmath3 ions is the dominant antiferromagnetic interaction in many cr@xmath3 delafossite compounds @xcite .",
    "since the direct exchange is strongly affected by the distance between cr@xmath3 ions , we can expect that the exchange parameter would be modulated by lattice vibrations .",
    "therefore , with this well - known exchange - striction effect it is possible to modify the exchange interactions @xmath28 @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a unit vector connecting cr@xmath3 ions in equilibrium sites i and j , @xmath31 is atomic displacement from site i , and @xmath32 is the magnitude of the first derivative of the exchange interaction with respects to the ionic displacements , thus coupling the magnetic order to lattice vibrations . therefore , the full hamiltonian can be expressed as following : @xmath33 where the first term is the simple heisenberg hamiltonian given in eq . @xmath22 and the second term in the bracket is the usual phonon hamiltonian .",

    "( d ) temperature depenence of the neutron intensity integrated over a range of 12.5@xmath1413 mev , as marked by the white dashed lines in ( a - c ) .",
    "the curve ( solid line ) at the bottom of ( d ) shows the phonon mode at 5 k with a @xmath24-contribution ( dotted line ) subtracted from the measured data points and fitted with a gaussian function . ]",
    "the full hamiltonian @xmath34 can be expressed in terms of single - magnon ( single - phonon ) creation , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , and anihilation , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , with the displacement @xmath39 being a single - operator term , whilst the spin @xmath40 is a two - operator term in the linear approximation .",
    "thus the exchange - striction coupling term is cubic in the boson operators , e.g. @xmath41 , and so should be weak .",
    "however , for non - collinear magnetic structures and going beyond lswt , @xmath40 also yields one - operator and three - operator terms @xcite .",
    "the one - magnon term can thus couple linearly with the one - phonon term , resulting in terms like @xmath42 and hence a stronger hybridization between phonon and magnon modes .    in principle , a magnon can couple with all of the phonon modes .",
    "however , as discussed above , coupling strength between magnons and phonons varies depending on the particular magnon or phonon modes involved . in this case",
    ", we observed that the intensity of the phonon at 12.5 mev is greatly enhanced below t@xmath8 so it is reasonable to use this mode in the calculation ( for computational reasons we do not consider the full phonon dispersion but only couple one einstein phonon mode to the previously calculated magnon spectrum ) .",
    "then , there are two reasons why the magnon - phonon coupling strength can be expected to be strongest around this phonon mode : first , the coupling between quasiparticles is expected to be large when the two modes are close in the momentum - energy space @xcite .",
    "second , due to the fact that the magnon - phonon coupling is proportional to inverse square - root of energy of phonons @xcite , the contribution of a high energy phonon may be small even if all of phonon modes have the same coupling constant .    using this full hamiltonian ,",
    "the following best fit parameters were obtained : j@xmath19 = 1.57 , j@xmath0 = @xmath43 and j@xmath21 = 0.145 mev , @xmath32 = 16.8 mev /  . the resulting dispersion is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b - c ) and the calculated @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the model now contains both magnon and coupled magnon - phonon mixed character and reproduces the 5 mev minima at the b point with the correct intensity , as well as the high energy signal at 12.5 mev .",
    "we note that the calculated @xmath16 does nt include the @xmath24-contribution since we did nt consider the nuclear structure factor related to lattice vibrations in the model hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "the good agreement between the model calculations and measurements thus strongly suggests that the observed deviations from lswt originates , at least partly , in the magnon - phonon coupling .",

    "( d ) calculated two - magnon continuum using the minimal heisenberg model in eq . @xmath22 . ]",
    "one remarkable deviation between our model calculations and the data comes from the upward shift of the phonon mode near the b point .",
    "this is an example of the phenomena of level repulsion : for quasiparticles with coupling between them , the dispersions of the quasiparticles repel each other by bending along the opposite directions , or they open a gap to avoid crossing . in cucro@xmath0 ,",
    "due to the large coupling between magnon and phonon modes , these two modes repel each other .",
    "however , the degree of bending in the 12.5 mev phonon mode as shown near b point in our model ( fig . [ fig2](c ) ) is bigger than in our measurement .",
    "it is an exaggerated feature of our simplified model since it assumes just one phonon mode , which forces the revel repulsion to be of the same degree as the magnon mode .",
    "further studies with theoretical calculations of the full phonon dispersion and the density of states are needed to estimate the actual contributions of all phonon modes accurately .",
    "to gain further insight into the magnitude of the magnon - phonon coupling constant , we can use high - pressure experimental data @xcite from the cucro@xmath0 literature to estimate @xmath32 . in case of a spin - lattice coupled compound ,",
    "when pressure is applied on the material , reduced atomic distances bring about the modulation of the exchange interaction , which results subsequently in the modulation of t@xmath8 .",
    "so it is possible to estimate the exchange - striction coefficient @xmath47 and the magnon - phonon coupling constant @xmath32 using the following formula : @xmath48    using the data found in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the values of @xmath49 10 @xmath50 and @xmath32 = 17.21(46 ) mev /  .",
    "these estimations are in good agreement with our best fit parameter ( @xmath32 = 16.8 mev /  ) , which shows that our assumptions are legitimate .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the exchange - striction coefficient @xmath47 of cr@xmath3 which we have determined is larger compared with the cases of other ions such as cu@xmath51 ( @xmath10 7 @xmath50 ) @xcite . considering that @xmath47 is equal to the exponent of the power law of the exchange interaction @xmath52 , such a large value of @xmath47 is consistent with the fact that the exchange interaction between cr@xmath3 is dominated by the direct exchange between the cr@xmath3 orbitals as discussed above .",
    "the last feature worthy of mentioning in our inelastic neutron spectra is the continuum within energy transfer @xmath10 10.5@xmath1411 mev at the b point .",
    "interestingly , it is located at @xmath53 , which is exactly the same position as that of the calculated two - magnon continuum in ref .",
