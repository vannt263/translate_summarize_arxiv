    "however , lest one should feel that the equation has only one specialized role in general relativity , namely that of delineating singularities , we remark that it has had far wider applications , as for example in establishing the so - called laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "the earliest of these laws or theorems is called hawking s theorem of increase of horizon area of a black hole .",
    "it states that @xcite    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the area of the event horizon of an isolated stationary black hole can never decrease in any physical process _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we recall first that a black hole spacetime @xmath0 is the set of events that lie in the _ complement _ of the chronological past of events infinitely distant and infinitely far in the future ( the future asymptotic null infinity @xmath1 ) .",
    "the event horizon of the black hole is the boundary @xmath2 of events in spacetime accessible to such observers .",
    "it is a null 2 + 1 dimensional surface hiding the black hole singularity .",
    "a sketch of the proof of hawking s theorem may be given as follows @xcite : recall that the raychaudhuri equation @xcite @xmath3 relates the evolution of the ( volume ) expansion @xmath4 of ( timelike and null ) geodesics , to the ` shear ' @xmath5 which quantifies relative stretching of geodesics in a congruence , the rotation or vorticity @xmath6 which exhibits how the geodesics twist around each other as they evolve and the spacetime curvature responsible for geodesic deviation .",
    "consider any null surface generated by null geodesics which we assume complete .",
    "a fixed time slice of such a surface is a spacelike 2-sphere of area @xmath7 .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation ( [ rce ] ) now implies that @xmath8 the expansion @xmath9 .",
    "assume @xmath10 in contrast to the case for studying singularities ; the area @xmath7 then increases locally .",
    "consider fixed time slices @xmath11 of event horizon at @xmath12 .",
    "the number of null geodesic generators intersecting @xmath13 is at least the same or bigger than those intersecting @xmath14 . at any instant , @xmath15 ; it follows then that @xmath16 which is what the theorem states .",
    "hawking s theorem brings to mind the law of entropy increase ( for isolated systems ) that follows from the second law of thermodynamics . yet , for a classical black hole spacetime , the complete absence of ` microstates ' involving atoms , electrons , photons or other discrete entities , stymies pushing the analogy very far .",
    "the situation turns curiouser because of other ` laws of ( stationary ) black hole mechanics ' derived on the basis of general relativity @xcite , wherein the geometrical quantity known as surface gravity ( @xmath17 ) appears as an analogue of temperature .",
    "this thermodynamic analogy of the theorems on stationary black hole mechanics , especially , hawking s theorem , led bekenstein @xcite to _ postulate _ that _ black holes must have an entropy proportional to the area of their horizons _",
    "@xmath18 here , @xmath19 is a dimensionless constant of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the planck length @xmath22 cm , characterizing the length scale at which spacetime can no longer be thought of in terms of classical riemannian geometry .",
    "it follows that black hole _",
    "thermodynamics _ must have to do with _ quantum _ , rather than classical , general relativity .",
    "the microstates from which @xmath23 originates must then correspond to the states of the quantum spacetime associated with the black hole , especially the event horizon .",
    "similarly , black hole temperature also has quantum origins , being associated with the mysterious hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "every generic black hole radiates particles in a thermal ( black body ) spectrum , at a temperature @xmath24 , a surprising result , if one remembers that the surface gravity @xmath17 is purely a geometric quantity . hawking radiation thus corresponds to _ transformation _ of quantum spacetime states describing the black hole , into thermal particle states . in a sense",
    ", it is an inversion of gravitational collapse whereby particle states collapse into spacetime states .",
    "the extra feature here is the thermalization of the particle states produced through hawking radiation , which eventually leads to the information loss conundrum .",
    "the issue we address here is that of thermal stability of generic radiant black holes in the heat bath made up of their own radiation .",
    "the asymptotically flat schwarzschild spacetime is well - known @xcite to have a thermal _ instability _ : the hawking temperature for a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 which implies that the specific heat @xmath27 the instability is attributed , within a standard canonical ensemble approach , to the superexponential growth of the density of states @xmath28 which results in the canonical partition function diverging for large @xmath25 .",
    "the problems with an approach based on an equilibrium canonical ensemble do not exist , at least for isolated spherically symmetric black holes , formulated as _ isolated horizons _",
    "@xcite of fixed horizon area ; these can be consistently described in terms of an equilibrium _ microcanonical _ ensemble with fixed @xmath29 ( and hence disallowing thermal fluctuations of the energy @xmath25 ) . for @xmath30 , it has been shown using loop quantum gravity @xcite , that all spherically symmetric four dimensional isolated horizons possess a microcanonical entropy obeying the bekenstein - hawking area law ( bhal ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "further , the microcanonical entropy has corrections to the bhal due to quantum spacetime fluctuations at fixed horizon area .",
    "these arise , in the limit of large @xmath29 , as an infinite series in inverse powers of horizon area beginning with a term logarithmic in the area @xcite , with completely finite coefficients , @xmath31 where @xmath32    on the other hand , asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes with spherical symmetry are known @xcite to be describable in terms of an equilibrium canonical ensemble , so long as the cosmological constant is large in magnitude . for this range of black hole parameters , to leading order in @xmath29 the canonical entropy obeys the bhal . as the magnitude of the cosmological constant",
    "is reduced , one approaches the so - called hawking - page phase transition to a ` phase ' which exhibits the same thermal instability as mentioned above .    in this article , we focus on the following    * is an understanding of the foregoing features of black hole entropy and thermal stability on some sort of a ` unified ' basis possible ?",
    "we shall argue , following @xcite-@xcite that it is indeed so , at least in the case of non - rotating black holes . * in addition to corrections ( to the area law ) due to fixed area quantum spacetime fluctuations computed using a microcanonical approach , can one compute corrections due to _ thermal _ fluctuations of horizon area within the canonical ensemble ? once again , the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "the result found in @xcite-@xcite , at least for the leading @xmath33 corrections , turns out to be _",
    "universal _ in the sense that , just like the bhal , it holds for all black holes independent of their parameters .",
    "following @xcite , we start with the canonical partition function in the quantum case @xmath34 recall that in classical general relativity in the hamiltonian formulation , the bulk hamiltonian is a first class constraint , so that the entire hamiltonian consists of the boundary contribution @xmath35 on the constraint surface . in the quantum domain , the hamiltonian operator can be written as @xmath36 with the subscripts @xmath37 and @xmath38 signifying bulk and boundary terms respectively . the hamiltonian constraint is then implemented by requiring @xmath39 for every physical state @xmath40 in the bulk .",
    "choose as basis for the hamiltonian in ( [ deco ] ) the states @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that the partition function may be factorized as @xmath42 thus , the relevance of the bulk physics seems rather limited due to the constraint ( [ hcon ] ) .",
    "the partition function further reduces to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the space of bulk states @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the ` boundary ' partition function given by @xmath47    since we are considering situations where , in addition to the boundary at asymptopia , there is also an inner boundary at the black hole horizon , quantum fluctuations of this boundary lead to black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the factorization in eq.([redp ] ) manifests in the canonical entropy as the appearance of an additive constant proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "since thermodynamic entropy is defined only upto an additive constant , we may argue that the bulk states do not play any role in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "this may be thought of as the origin of a weaker version of the holographic hypothesis @xcite .    for our purpose , it is more convenient to rewrite ( [ zs ] ) as @xmath49 where , we have made the assumptions that ( a ) the energy is a function of the area of the horizon @xmath29 and ( b ) this area is quantized .",
    "the first assumption ( a ) basically originates in the idea in the last paragraph of that black hole thermodynamics ensues solely from the boundary states whose energy ought to be a function of some property of the boundary like area . the second assumption ( b )",
    "is actually explicitly provable in theories like ncqgr as we now briefly digress to explain .",
    "the basic canonical degrees of freedom in ncqgr are holonomies of a distributional @xmath50 connection and fluxes of the densitized triad conjugate to this connection .",
    "the gauss law ( local @xmath50 invariance ) and momentum ( spatial diffeomorphism ) constraints are realized as self - adjoint operators constructed out of these variables .",
    "states annihilated by these constraint operators span the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "particularly convenient bases for this kinematical hilbert space are the spin network bases . in any of these bases ,",
    "a ( ` spinet ' ) state is described in terms of _ links _ @xmath51 carrying spins ( @xmath50 irreducible representations ) @xmath52 and _ vertices _ carrying invariant @xmath50 tensors ( ` intertwiners ' ) .",
    "a particularly important property of such bases is that geometrical observables like area operator are diagonal in this basis with _",
    "discrete spectrum_. an internal boundary of a spacetime like a horizon appears in this kinematical description as a punctured @xmath53 with each puncture having a deficit angle @xmath54 , as shown in fig.1 .    for macroscopically large boundary areas",
    "@xmath55 , the area spectrum is dominated by @xmath56 .",
    "this is the situation when the deficit angles at each puncture takes its smallest nontrivial value , so that a classical horizon emerges .",
    "that implies that @xmath57 this completes our digression on ncqgr .",
    "we now move on to discuss the effect of inclusion of gaussian thermal fluctuations of the horizon area .",
    "the canonical entropy is expected to receive additional corrections due to such fluctuations over and above those due to quantum spacetime fluctuations already included in the microcanoncal entropy .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "( [ zss ] ) , we can now rewrite the partition function as an integral , using the poisson resummation formula @xmath58 for macroscopically large horizon areas @xmath59 , @xmath60 , so that the summation on the _ rhs _ of ( [ poi ] ) is dominated by the contribution of the @xmath61 term . in this approximation , we have @xmath62 \\label{appr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the microcanonical entropy .",
    "now , in equilibrium statistical mechanics , there is an inherent ambiguity in the definition of the microcanonical entropy , since it may also be defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the density of states .",
    "the relation between these two definitions involves the ` jacobian ' factor @xmath66 @xmath67 clearly , this ambiguity is irrelevant if all one is interested in is the leading order bhal . however , if one is interested in logarithmic corrections to bhal as we are , this difference is crucial and must be taken into account .",
    "we next proceed to evaluate the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) using the saddle point approximation around the point @xmath68 where @xmath25 is to be identified with the ( classical ) mass of the boundary ( horizon ) . integrating over the gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point , and dropping higher order terms ,",
    "we get , @xmath69 \\ } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot & \\left [ { \\pi \\over -s_{mc}''(m ) } \\right]^{1/2}~. \\label{spa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath70 , we obtain for the canonical entropy @xmath71 @xmath72 where , @xmath73 ^ 2~\\left [ s_{mc}'({a } ) ~{m''({a } ) \\over m'({a})}~-~s_{mc}''({a } ) \\right]~. \\label{delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the canonical entropy is expressed in terms of the microcanonical entropy for an average large horizon area , and the mass which is also a function of the area .",
    "clearly , stable equilibrium ensues so long as @xmath74 .    additional support for this condition can be gleaned by considering the thermal capacity of the system , using the standard relation @xmath75 with @xmath76 being derived from the microcanonical entropy @xmath77 , and hence a function of @xmath29 .",
    "one obtains for the heat capacity the relation @xmath78",
    "^ 2~\\delta^{-1 } ~ , \\label{hc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath79 if only if @xmath74 . since the positivity of the heat capacity is certainly a necessary condition for stable thermal equilibrium , it is gratifying that an identical criterion emerges for @xmath80 as found from the canonical entropy ( [ scan ] ) .",
    "using now eq , ( [ delta ] ) for the expression for @xmath80 , the criterion for thermal stability of non - rotating macroscopic black holes is then easily seen to be @xmath81 as already mentioned in the summary .",
    "we have been using units in which @xmath82 . if we revert back to units where these constants are not set to unity , the lower bound eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) can be re - expressed as @xmath83 we remind the reader that in contrast to semiclassical approaches based on specific properties of classical metrics , our approach incorporates crucially the microcanonical entropy generated by quantum spacetime fluctuations that leave the horizon area constant .",
    "apart from the plausible assumption of the black hole mass being dependent only on the horizon area , no other assumption has been made to arrive at the result .",
    "even so , it subsumes most results based on the semiclassical approach .    as a byproduct of the above analysis",
    ", the canonical entropy for stable black holes can be expressed in terms of the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath84 as @xmath85 ~.\\label{sc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any smooth @xmath86 , one can truncate its power series expansion in @xmath29 at some large order and show that the quantity in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) does not contribute to the @xmath87 term , so that @xmath88 where , @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ smc ] ) . note that this is the result for an isolated horizon described by an @xmath50 chern simons theory . for a @xmath90 chern simons theory , @xmath91 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the interplay between constant area quantum spacetime fluctuations and thermal fluctuations is obvious in the coefficient of the @xmath92 term where the contribution due to each appears with a specific sign .",
    "it is not surprising that the thermal fluctuation contribution increases the canonical entropy .",
    "the cancellation occurring for horizons on which a residual @xmath90 subgroup of @xmath50 survives , because of additional gauge fixing by the boundary conditions describing an isolated horizon @xcite , may indicate a possible non - renormalization theorem , although no special symmetry like supersymmetry has been employed anywhere above .",
    "it is thus generic for all non - rotating black holes , including those with electric or dilatonic charge .",
    "while so far we have restricted our attention to thermal fluctuations of area due to energy fluctuations alone , the stability criterion ( [ crit ] ) can be shown to hold when in addition thermal fluctuations of electric charge are incorporated within a grand canonical ensemble @xcite . as in @xcite , we assume that energy spectrum is a function of the discrete area spectrum ( well - known in lqg @xcite ) and a discrete charge spectrum .",
    "the charge spectrum is of course equally spaced in general ; for large macroscopic black holes the area spectrum is equally spaced as well .    in a basis",
    "in which both the area and charge operators are simultaneously diagonal , the grand canonical partition function can be expressed as @xmath93 ~ , \\label{gpf5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath94 is the degeneracy corresponding to the area eigenvalue @xmath95 and charge eigenvalue @xmath96 . using a generalization of the poisson resummation formula @xmath97 and assuming that the partition sum is dominated by the large eigenvalues @xmath98",
    ", it can be expressed as a double integral @xmath99 note that the transition from the discrete sum to the integral for @xmath100 requires only that the dominant eigenvalues are large compared to the fundamental units of discreteness which for the area is the planck area and for the charge is the electronic charge .",
    "these conditions are of course fulfilled for all astrophysical black holes .",

    "( [ smc ] ) to observe that both @xmath122 and @xmath123 are positive definite for macroscopically large areas .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for thermal stability , under both energy and charge fluctuations , can now be transcribed into the three simple inequalities @xmath124 where , we have used the notation @xmath125 etc .",
    "we have assumed of course that the horizon area @xmath126 .",
    "since we are identifying the black hole mass @xmath25 with the mass defined for the isolated non - radiating non - accreting horizon , we can recall our earlier assumption that @xmath127 , so that @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the mass associated with the isolated horizon ought to relate to the horizon area just as the bulk hamiltonian relates to the volume operator ( as shown in ref .",
    "the quantum mass spectrum thus should be related to the area spectrum . on the other hand , electric charge has no such geometric origin , and is independent of the area , as far as one can make out .",
    "this implies that @xmath129 substituting eq .",

    "( [ crit ] ) emerges once again*. it is not difficult to see that this , when substituted back into ( [ deto ] ) , merely reproduces ( [ cha ] ) , thereby establishing consistency between the inequalities .",
    "is it possible to derive as a bonus , as in the case of non - fluctuating charge , a general formula for the thermal fluctuation correction to the canonical entropy , logarithmic in the horizon area ?",
    "we believe it is indeed the case , but do not include that discussion here .",
    "can this criterion continue to hold if the black hole is characterized by a number of @xmath90 charges @xmath130 , all independently quantized ?",
    "this situation typically ensues in black holes arising in the low energy supergravity limit of string theories .",
    "the matrix @xmath114 is then an @xmath131 matrix , and the analogues of eq.s ( [ mas])-([deto ] ) now become more complicated , involving sums of products of derivatives of @xmath132 . despite this , so long as one stays away from extremality , it is not inconceiveable that the mass alone decides on the stability issue .",
    "the laws of black hole mechanics derived from the raychaudhuri equation have inevitably led to worldwide attempts to seek quantum formulations of general relativity .",
    "a reasonably satisfactory understanding of black hole entropy has been achieved : the entropy of radiant black holes is completely described in terms of the microcanonical entropy of isolated horizons which , in turn , is more or less entirely understood within the scheme of loop quantum gravity , at least for the cases without rotation .",
    "inclusion of rotation into the lqg approach to microcanonical entropy remains now foremost on the agenda , since , like the mass of the isolated horizon , and unlike @xmath90 charges , the angular momentum is also likely to be determined by the horizon area in the isolated case .",
