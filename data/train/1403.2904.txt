    "[ fig : ferh_phasediag ] clearly demonstrates that @xmath115 and @xmath156 strongly depend on the lattice constant . at low lattice constants",
    "@xmath156 is larger than @xmath115 , however , with increasing lattice constant @xmath156 decreases while @xmath115 increases .",
    "this is in accordance with our results for the lattice constant dependence of the total energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ferh_etot - a ] ) and also with earlier findings that with increasing volume the afm character of ferh becomes weaker due to the weakening of the afm intersublattice fe - fe interactions.@xcite our work on partially ordered and non - stoichiometric ferh shows that fe ` defects ' on the rh sublattice dramatically enhance the fm interactions.@xcite    by mapping the dependence of the nel and curie temperatures on the lattice parameter , we can gain insight into the high - temperature phase transition describing the system . at low volumes , when @xmath157 , there exists a temperature range , @xmath158 , where the pm phase is stable against the fm phase , however , the afm state is still ordered , i.e. , the pm phase is unstable against the afm phase",
    ". therefore , in case of @xmath159 the high - temperature phase transition is afm - pm .",
    "conversely , for higher volumes , when @xmath160 , the high - temperature transition is fm - pm . by scanning the curie and nel temperatures as a function of lattice constant we can chart the high - temperature fm - pm and afm - pm lines of the phase diagram of ferh , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_phasediag ] .",
    "( color online ) approximate phase diagram of ferh from rdlm as a function of lattice constant and temperature .",
    "blue circles and red squares mark calculated curie and nel temperatures , respectively , while black filled squares denote metamagnetic transition points as obtained from free energy calculations . the blue and red solid lines and the black dashed lines represent the corresponding phase boundary lines . ]",
    "the nel and curie temperature curves cross over at @xmath161 , forming a triple point at @xmath162 ( topmost filled black square in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_phasediag ] ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath163 , as annealed from the pm phase the system first orders in the fm phase .",
    "however , the @xmath1 limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_etot - a ] ) indicates that in the ground state the transition from afm to fm occurs at @xmath164 ( bottommost filled black square in fig .  [",
    "fig : ferh_phasediag ] ) .",
    "consequently , between these two lattice constants there has to be an additional transition from the fm to the afm phase .",
    "this is the manifestation of the metamagnetic phase transition of ferh provided by our rdlm theory .",
    "we note that the situation is similar to the spin - reorientation transitions in ferromagnetic thin film systems : when the ground - state magnetization is oriented normal to plane , while the curie temperature related to the in - plane magnetization is higher than for the out - of - plane magnetization , a temperature - induced reorientation transition occurs between these two orientations.@xcite    to find the metamagnetic transition line of the phase diagram , we computed the rdlm free energy curves for some values of the lattice constant .",
    "as mentioned above , in the afm phase the weiss field at the rh sites vanishes and local rh moments only form in the fm phase .",
    "these moments were treated as induced in our calculations , and as such enslaved to the robust fe moments ( the magnitude of which changed less than 2% as a function of temperature for every case ) . the spin - disorder entropy term eq .   entering the free energy correspondingly only contains contributions from the fe sites , however the cost of rh moment formation is included in the ( average ) total energy in a self - consistent manner .    reassuringly , for lattice constants",
    "@xmath165 and @xmath166 we did nt find a crossover between the fm and afm free energy curves , indicating that one of these phases remains stable in the entire temperature range up to the pm transition temperature . for the case of @xmath167 we plotted the difference of the free energies , @xmath168 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_crossover ] for a broad temperature range .",
    "note that this plot is in fact the difference of cubic spline fits to the calculated free energies , since the afm and fm rdlm calculations were performed for different temperature values .",
    "this plot indeed reveals a crossover through zero at temperature @xmath169 , which can be interpreted as the metamagnetic transition temperature at this fixed lattice constant .",
    "noteworthy , for high temperatures the free energy difference turns back towards zero .",
    "this happens since both the fm and afm states approach smoothly the pm state , implying @xmath170 @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 being the average total energy , the spin - entropy and the excess electronic free energy ( cf .",
    "eq  ) in the paramagnetic phase , respectively .",
    "we also examined the role of the electronic free energy , @xmath173 ( eq .  ) , in the metamagnetic phase transition .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_crossover ] corresponds to the case when @xmath173 was neglected .",
    "as can be seen , switching off @xmath173 increases the free energy of the fm phase with respect to the afm phase in the whole temperature range .",
    "this can clearly be attributed to the fact that the dos at the fermi energy is significantly larger in the fm phase than in the afm phase . only above 650  k",
    "does @xmath174 start to increase rapidly , giving rise to a sharp decrease of the magnitude of the free energy difference between the two phases .",
    "as a consequence , due to @xmath173 @xmath175 decreases from 539  k ( zero of the dashed curve ) to 461  k.    we completed calculations to determine the metamagnetic transition temperature for three selected lattice constants .",
    "the corresponding @xmath176 data are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_phasediag ] as black filled squares . nevertheless , including the @xmath1 point at @xmath177 and the triple point , @xmath178 at @xmath179 , a smooth metamagnetic phaseline could be drawn ( black dashes ) making the rdlm phase diagram complete .",

    "the dashed curve corresponds to the case when the electronic free energy contribution , @xmath173 , is neglected . ]",
    "while the existence of metamagnetic phase transitions as well as the trend of magnetic ordering against the volume are correctly captured by our rdlm theory , the quantitative agreement is rather poor with respect to experiments reporting @xmath180@xcite and @xmath181@xcite at zero pressure ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "as already discussed before , one reason for this disagreement can be understood due to the mean field approximation overestimating the transition temperatures .",
    "a similarly high curie temperature , @xmath183 , at @xmath184 was obtained also from _ ab initio _ spin - fluctuation theory.@xcite another shortcoming of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferh_phasediag ] is that the region of the equilibrium lattice constants , @xmath185 is very close to the triple point at @xmath186 resulting in too high metamagnetic transition temperatures of about 800 - 900  k. in terms of spin - fluctuation theory  @xcite a more realistic transition temperature of @xmath187 was obtained .",
    "this could indicate that the spin - disorder entropy is underestimated by our rdlm approach in the fm state of ferh , most probably because of neglecting the transversal degrees of freedom of the rather large induced spin - moments of rh .",
    "it should be mentioned that the present rdlm results could also be improved by using exchange - correlation functionals beyond lsda like the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite the total energy differences between the fm and afm states could also be inaccurate due to the asa , and so a full potential treatment should improve our results . furthermore , our recent finding of the high compositional sensitivity of the metamagnetic transition highlights a possible source for the disparity between experiments and theory.@xcite",
    "we have presented a relativistic disordered local moment scheme capable of describing finite - temperature spin disorder self - consistently . based on the feynman  peierls  bogoliubov inequality a variationally best mean field approximation provides the orientational distribution of spins , which is iterated simultaneously with the potentials during the self - consistent loop .",
    "the kkr - cpa method provides a convenient and natural framework for the theory .",
    "using a self - consistent procedure at finite temperatures gives us a powerful tool by including longitudinal spin fluctuations and the effect of induced moments on the electronic structure .",

    "test calculations for bulk bcc fe showed that even in a `` good moment '' system the magnitude of the local moment can vary significantly with spin disorder .",
    "because of the mean field approximation underlying the rdlm scheme the curie temperature was largely overestimated by the calculations .",
    "therefore , the obtained thermodynamic quantities should be considered as a function of the average magnetization rather than of the temperature .",
    "the temperature - dependent calculations revealed that in the fept alloys the spin moment of fe is stable within about 2% , while pt displays an induced moment indicated by its linear relationship with the overall magnetization of the system . in agreement with earlier results we established that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of fept is drastically reduced by increasing long - range chemical disorder .",
    "the magnetization dependence of the mae was found power - like for any degree of chemical disorder , with an exponent of about 2.1 for weak disorder and of somewhat larger value for more more disordered samples , reproducing the tendencies reported by experiment .",
    "we set up an _ ab initio _ phase diagram for bulk ferh as a function of the lattice constant and the temperature .",
    "the tendency of afm vs.  fm order against volume was found correctly both for the ground state and for the paramagnetic transitions . from simple thermodynamic arguments we concluded that there is a range of volume where a temperature - induced afm - fm phase transition should occur .",
    "the temperature of the metamagnetic transition were numerically determined from the crossovers in the free energy of the fm and afm states .    beside of the qualitative success of our rdlm theory , we noticed quantitative disagreements , in particular , concerning the estimated transition temperatures .",
