    "bosonization techniques have been extensively used in the study of one - dimensional electron and spin systems @xcite .",
    "the success of the method is based on the fact that the low energy properties of fermions are determined by the states close to the fermi surface which in one dimension consists only of two points .",
    "when the spectrum is linearized around the fermi points the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of bosonic operators associated with particle - hole excitations of momentum @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , scattering processes between left and right fermi points require to introduce extra operators , the so - called klein factors .    perturbations like impurity scattering or a modulation of the hopping lead to nonlinearities in the bosonized hamiltonian , for which an exact solution is known only in some special cases @xcite . in general one has to resort to approximative methods like renormalization group calculations .",
    "another more intuitive method is the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) where the non - linear terms are replaced by a harmonic potential with parameters to be determined self - consistently according to a variational principle for the energy .",
    "the scha has been successfully applied to various non - linear field theories @xcite . in the context of bosonized hamiltonians ,",
    "however , the existence of klein factors has been ignored in these approaches .",
    "this may be justified for infinite systems @xcite , but in general the klein factors have to be treated carefully as pointed out for example in the context of impurity models and two - leg ladders @xcite . in the following we present an extension of the scha which treats the bosonic fields and the klein factors on equal footing . as a prototype model for this study",
    "we consider the lattice model of spinless fermions at half filling including nearest - neighbor interaction and a modulation of the hopping due to a periodic lattice distortion .    in the next section",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is bosonized and a trial hamiltonian is constructed which serves as the basis for the scha . in sect .  3 we calculate the energy gap and the drude weight and compare our results with exact results that are available for certain values of the model parameters .",
    "finally we conclude with a brief summary in sect .  4 .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model of spinless fermions with static dimerization @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dimerization parameter that leads to a periodic modulation of the hopping amplitude @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the strength of the nearest - neighbor interaction . at half filling and in the range @xmath5",
    "the bosonized hamiltonian of this model reads @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are conjugate fields .",
    "the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath9 and the luttinger parameter @xmath10 are related to the interaction according to @xmath11 . the normal ordering operation ( @xmath12 )",
    "is introduced to avoid the divergences associated with unphysical states assumed by the luttinger model .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is needed in the bosonization formalism to remove ultra - violet divergences in certain @xmath14-summations , and appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : totalhamilt ] ) since the exponential @xmath15 is not normal ordered . for a lattice model",
    ", @xmath16 can be interpreted as a kind of effective band - width @xcite , whereas in the continuum the limit @xmath17 has to be performed in order to obtain the correct @xmath18-function anticommutators of the fermionic field operators @xcite . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the charge and current operators , defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 count the number of left and right moving particles with respect to the filled fermi sea .",
    "the klein factors @xmath25 and @xmath26 rise or lower the number of left and right moving fermions by one ( which no combination of bosonic operators can ever do ) , and they assure also that fermions of the two different species anticommute .",
    "the dimerization , described by the non - linear term of the hamiltonian , breaks the conservation of the current @xmath20 and is responsible for the opening of an energy gap .    to discuss the gap formation quantitatively",
    ", we use the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) which has originally been introduced for the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "the idea is to construct an exactly solvable trial hamiltonian @xmath27 where the bosonic fields in ( [ eq : totalhamilt ] ) are decoupled from the klein factors and where the non - linear terms @xmath28 are replaced with a quadratic form @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly we chose @xmath30 as the sum of two commuting parts @xmath31 and @xmath32 each of them depending on a single variational parameter , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "notice that from the standard trial hamiltonian alone ( eq .  ( [ eq : htriala ] ) ) , only the trivial solution @xmath35 can be obtained .",
    "therefore the non - standard term eq .",
    "( [ eq : htrialb ] ) is necessarily required to describe the phase transition in the system .",
    "since we are only interested in properties at zero temperature we use the normalized ground state @xmath36 of @xmath27 as a variational wave - function for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : totalhamilt ] ) .",
    "this provides us with an upper bound @xmath37 for the ground state energy @xmath38 of ( [ eq : totalhamilt ] ) due to the inequality @xmath39 minimizing @xmath37 with respect to the variational parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 yields the following set of equations : @xmath40        b       & = & ( tu /{\\pi a } )",

    "the products of klein factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 appearing in @xmath42 change the quantum number of the current operator from @xmath20 to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath42 can therefore be regarded as a particle moving in a harmonic potential along the @xmath20-axis . for @xmath51 the potential energy term in @xmath42 vanishes and the kinetic energy term with imaginary hopping @xmath52 yields the ground state energy @xmath53 . in this limit",

    "the value @xmath67 obtained within the variational approach is in accordance with the exact result based on a mapping of the bosonized hamiltonian on the ashkin - teller model @xcite for @xmath62 .",
    "however , according to renormalization group calculations @xcite and confirmed numerically using density matrix renormalization group @xcite , the phase boundary in the @xmath65-@xmath2 plane shifts to larger values of @xmath65 with increasing @xmath2 while the scha gives a vertical line . on the other hand ,",
    "the exponent @xmath68 characterizing the opening of the gap is exact @xcite . in particular for non - interacting fermions @xmath69",
    "the luttinger liquid parameter is @xmath70 and therefore @xmath71 in agreement with the exact energy gap @xmath72 . at @xmath73 , where umklapp scattering becomes relevant and leads to the opening of a correlation gap , eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) yields @xmath74 which agrees with the exact result @xmath75 up to the logarithmic correction @xcite .    in the following we consider a system of finite length @xmath76 .",
    "in order to calculate the ground state energy of @xmath42 it is convenient to switch to the momentum representation , @xmath77 , where the trial hamiltonian reads @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions for the wave - function , @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation is known as mathieu s equation .",
    "accordingly , the ground state energy of @xmath42 has the following asymptotical behavior @xcite @xmath80 combining the two equations ( [ eq : varpar ] ) one obtains @xmath81 which can be used to relate the two limiting cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) with two different physical situations : the condition @xmath82 is equivalent with @xmath83 and therefore the results for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the same as for the infinite system i.e.  the energy gap depends algebraically on the dimerization . on the other hand , the condition @xmath86 implies that @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the energy gap is purely due to the finite system size and of order @xmath88 .",
    "thus the crossover from a finite - size gap to a true dimerization gap coincides with the crossover between the regions where klein factors are relevant or can be ignored . in general , the set of equations ( [ eq : varpar ] ) can only be solved numerically .",
    "1 shows the size - dependent energy gap @xmath89 , i.e.  the lowest excitation energy of the bosonic modes , as function of @xmath2 for several values of the system size @xmath76 ; notice that we consider a system with periodic boundary conditions , where the smallest wave number is @xmath90 .",

    "the dashed line is the analytic result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) valid for @xmath51 and @xmath57.,width=321,height=188 ]    we now turn to the calculation of the drude weight @xmath95 within the scha formalism .",
    "the drude weight or charge stiffness is the central quantity to characterize charge transport at zero frequency . at @xmath96",
    "the real part of the electrical conductivity at frequency @xmath97 is of the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 for @xmath100 in a system without impurities .",

    "alternatively , the parameter @xmath105 can also be associated with a change of boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath106 corresponds to periodic and @xmath107 to antiperiodic boundary conditions . in the fermionic model ( [ eq : dim - term ] ) the hopping parameter @xmath3 picks up a phase factor",
    "@xmath108 when a flux @xmath105 is applied . in the bosonized form ( [ eq : totalhamilt ] )",
    "the only modification is that the current operator @xmath20 has to be replaced by @xcite @xmath109 .",
    "correspondingly , we modify the @xmath34-dependent part of the the trial hamiltonian and write @xmath110 applying the same procedure as in the case @xmath106 yields a variational estimate @xmath37 for the ground state energy which now depends on the flux @xmath105 , i.e.  @xmath111 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , obtained from the gap equations ( [ eq : varpar ] ) , are also functions of @xmath105 . on first sight",
    "it might seem impossible to calculate the drude weight using eq .",

    "it is now straightforward to calculate the drude weight for a finite system of size @xmath76 in the gapped phase @xmath125 . in the `` finite size gap '' region ( @xmath126 )",

    "i.e.  for @xmath131 and @xmath132 we may compare the results obtained within the scha with the exact drude weight ( see appendix ) @xmath133 although the expected exponential behavior is recovered in the scha result , the different numerical factor in the exponent shows the limitations of the method .",
    "we have constructed an extension of the scha in order to account for the existence of klein factors in bosonized hamiltonians with non - linear perturbations . as an application we have investigated a model of spinless fermions with modulated hopping . for the infinite system , both the value of the luttinger parameter @xmath67 where the transition from a gapless to a gapped phase takes places and the exponent @xmath134 that characterizes the opening of the gap for @xmath62 are correctly obtained within the scha . however , the bending of the phase boundary for finite values of @xmath2 is not reproduced . when considering a finite system klein factors can not be ignored _ a priori_. within our approach it turns out , that the crossover region from a finite size gap to a true dimerization gap coincides with the crossover to the region where the klein factors become relevant .",
    "the drude weight reflects the sensitivity of the system with respect to a change of boundary conditions and is related to the properties of the current operator @xmath20 in the bosonized version of the hamiltonian . in a finite system with an energy gap @xmath33 the drude weight",
