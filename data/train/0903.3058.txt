    "have been shown to be useful alternatives to explicit solvation for applications including protein folding and binding,@xcite and small molecule hydration free energy prediction.@xcite    modern implicit solvent models@xcite include distinct estimators for the non - polar and electrostatic components of the hydration free energy .",
    "the non - polar component corresponds to the free energy of hydration of the uncharged solute while the electrostatic component corresponds to the free energy of turning on the solute partial charges .",
    "the latter is typically modeled treating the water solvent as a uniform high - dielectric continuum.@xcite methods based on the numerical solution of the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation@xcite provide a virtually exact representation of the response of the solvent within the dielectric continuum approximation .",

    "the development of computationally efficient analytical and differentiable gb methods based on pairwise descreening schemes@xcite has made possible the integration of gb models in molecular dynamics packages for biological simulations.@xcite    the non - polar hydration free energy component accounts for all non - electrostatic solute - solvent interactions as well as hydrophobic interactions,@xcite which are essential driving forces in biological processes such as protein folding@xcite and binding.@xcite historically the non - polar hydration free energy has been modeled by empirical surface area models@xcite which are still widely employed.@xcite surface area models are useful as a first approximation , however qualitative deficiencies have been observed.@xcite    few years ago we presented the analytical generalized born plus non - polar ( agbnp ) implicit solvent model,@xcite which introduced two key innovations with respect to both the electrostatic and non - polar components . unlike most implicit solvent models , the agbnp non - polar hydration free energy model includes distinct estimators for the solute  solvent van der waals dispersion energy and cavity formation work components .",
    "the main advantages of a model based on the cavity / dispersion decomposition of the non - polar solvation free energy stem from its ability to describe both medium range solute  solvent dispersion interactions , which depend on solute composition , as well as conformational equilibria dominated by short - range hydrophobic interactions , which mainly depend on solute conformation alone.@xcite a series of studies highlight the importance of the balance between hydrophobicity and dispersion interactions in regulating the structure of the hydration shell and the strength of interactions between macromolecules.@xcite in agbnp the work of cavity formation is described by a surface area - dependent model,@xcite while the dispersion estimator is based on the integral of van der waals solute  solvent interactions over the solvent modeled as a uniform continuum.@xcite this form of the non - polar estimator had been motivated by a series of earlier studies@xcite and has since been shown by us@xcite and others@xcite to be qualitatively superior to models based only on the surface area in reproducing explicit solvent results as well as rationalizing structural and thermodynamical experimental observations .",
    "the electrostatic solvation model in agbnp is based on the pairwise descreening gb scheme@xcite whereby the born radius of each atom is obtained by summing an appropriate descreening function over its neighbors . the main distinction between the agbnp gb model and conventional pairwise descreening implementations is that in agbnp the volume scaling factors , which offset the overcounting of regions of space occupied by more than one atom , are computed from the geometry of the molecule rather than being introduced as geometry - independent parameters fit to either experiments or to numerical poisson - boltzmann results.@xcite the reduction of number of parameters achieved with this strategy improves the transferability of the model to unusual functional groups often found in ligand molecules , which would otherwise require the introduction of numerous parameters.@xcite    given its characteristics , the agbnp model has been mainly targeted to applications involving molecular dynamics canonical conformational sampling , and to the study of protein - ligand complexes . since its inception the model has been employed in the investigation of a wide variety of biomolecular problems ranging from peptide conformational propensity prediction and folding,@xcite ensemble - based interpretation of nmr experiments,@xcite protein loop homology modeling,@xcite the study of intrinsically disordered proteins,@xcite ligand - induced conformational changes in proteins,@xcite conformational equilibria of protein - ligand complexes,@xcite protein - ligand binding affinity prediction,@xcite and structure - based vaccine design.@xcite the agbnp model has been re - implemented and adopted with minor modifications by other investigators.@xcite the main elements of the agbnp non - polar and electrostatic models have been independently validated,@xcite and have been incorporated in recently proposed hydration free energy models.@xcite    in this work we present a new implicit solvent model named agbnp2 which builds upon the original agbnp implementation ( hereafter referred to as agbnp1 ) and improves it with respect to the the description of the solute volume and the treatment of short  range solute  water electrostatic interactions .",
    "continuum dielectric models assume that the solvent can be described by a linear and uniform dielectric medium.@xcite this assumption is generally valid at the macroscopic level , however at the molecular level water exhibits significant deviations from this behavior.@xcite non - linear dielectric responses , the non - uniform distribution of water molecules , charge asymmetry and electrostriction effects@xcite are all phenomena originating from the finite size and internal structure of water molecules as well as their specific interactions which are not taken into account by continuum dielectric models .",
    "some of these effects are qualitatively captured by standard classical fixed - charge explicit water models , however others , such as polarization and hydrogen bonding interactions , can be fully modeled only by adopting more complex physical models.@xcite gb models make further simplifications in addition to the dielectric continuum approximation , thereby compounding the challenge of achieving with gb - based implicit solvent models the level of realism required to reliably model phenomena , such as protein folding and binding , characterized by relatively small free energy changes .    in the face of these challenges a reasonable approach is to adopt an empirical hydration free energy model motivated by physical arguments@xcite parametrized with respect to experimental data on small molecule hydration.@xcite models of this kind typically score conformations on the basis of the degree of solvent exposure of solute atoms .",
    "historically@xcite the solvent accessible surface area of the solute has been used for this purpose , while modern implementations suitable for conformational sampling applications often employ computationally convenient volumetric measures.@xcite in this work we take this general approach but we retain the gb model component which we assume to form a useful baseline to describe the long  range influence of the water medium .",
    "the empirical parametrized component of the model then takes the form of an empirical first solvation shell correction function designed so as to absorb hydration effects not accurately described by the gb model .",
    "specifically , as described below , we employ a short  range analytical hydrogen bonding correction function based on the degree of water occupancy taking into account the finite size of water molecules , of appropriately chosen hydration sites on the solute surface .",
    "the aim of this model is to effectively introduce some explicit solvation features without actually adding water molecules to the system as for example done in hybrid explicit / implicit models.@xcite    in this work we also enhance the volume description of the solute , which in agbnp1 is modeled by means of atomic spheres of radius equal to the atomic van der waals radius .",
    "the deficiencies of the van der waals solute volume model have been recognized.@xcite they stem from the presence of high - dielectric interstitial spaces in the solute interior which are too small to contain discrete water molecules .",
    "these spurious high dielectric spaces contribute to the hydration of buried or partially buried atoms causing underestimation of desolvation effects .",
    "the volume enclosed by the molecular surface ( ms ) , defined as the surface produced by a solvent spherical probe ( of @xmath0   radius for water ) rolling on the van der waals surface of the solute,@xcite represents the region which is inaccessible to water molecules and is often referred as the solvent excluding volume ( sev).@xcite the sev , lacking the spurious high - dielectric interstitial spaces , provides a better representation of the low - dielectric region associated with the solute .",
    "for this reason accurate poisson - boltzmann solvers,@xcite have employed the sev description of the solute region .    despite its clear advantages ,",
    "the lack of of analytical and computational efficient descriptions of the sev have hampered its deployment in conjunction with gb models for molecular dynamics applications .",
    "the gbmv series of models@xcite achieve high accuracy relative to numerical poisson calculations in part by employing the sev description of the solute volume .",
    "the analytical versions of gbmv@xcite describe the sev volume by means of a continuous and differentiable solute density function which is integrated on a grid to yield atomic born radii . in this work",
    "we present a model for the sev that preserves the analytical pairwise atomic descreening approach employed in the agbnp1 model,@xcite which avoids computations on a grid .",
    "we show that this approximate model reproduces all of the key features of the sev while yielding the same favorable algorithmic scaling of pairwise descreening approaches .",
    "in this section we briefly review the formulation of the agbnp1 implicit solvent model , which forms the basis for the new agbnp2 model .",

    "we have developed the agbnp2 implicit solvent model which is based on an empirical ( but physically - motivated ) first solvation shell correction function parametrized against experimental hydration free energies of small molecules and the results of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of a series of mini - proteins .",
    "the correction function favors conformations of the solute in which polar groups are oriented so as to form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water solvent thereby achieving a more balanced equilibrium with respect to the competing intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions",
    ". a key ingredient of the model is an analytical prescription to identify and measure the volume of hydration sites on the solute surface .",
    "hydration sites that are deemed too small to contain a water molecule do not contribute to the solute hydration free energy .",
    "conversely , hydration sites of sufficient size form favorable interactions with nearby polar groups .",
    "this model thus incorporates the effects of both water granularity and of non - linear first shell hydration effects .",
    "the gb and non - polar models in the agbnp2 implicit solvent model provide the linear continuum dielectric model basis of the model as well as a description of non - electrostatic hydration effects.@xcite in this work the gb and solute  solvent dispersion interaction energy models are further enhanced by replacing the original van der waals solute volume model with a more realistic solvent excluding volume ( sev ) model .",
    "the new volume description improves the quality of the born radii of buried atoms and atoms participating in intramolecular interactions which would otherwise be underestimated due to high dielectric interstitial spaces present with the van der waals volume description.@xcite gb models with these characteristics have been previously proposed .",
    "the gbmv series of models@xcite represent the sev on a grid which , although accurate , is computationally costly and lacks frame of reference invariance .",
    "the pairwise descreening - based gb@xmath154 model@xcite introduced an empirical rectifying function to increase the born radii of buried atoms in an averaged , geometry - independent manner .",
    "the gbn model@xcite introduced the neck region between pairs of atoms as additional source of descreening , dampened by empirical parameters to account in an average way for overlaps between neck regions and between solute atoms and neck regions .",
    "the approach proposed here to represent the sev consists of computing the atomic self - volumes [ eq .  ( [ vself ] ) ] , used in the pairwise descreening computation , using enlarged atomic radii so as to cover the interatomic interstitial spaces . the self - volume of each atom",
    "is then reduced proportionally to its solvent accessible surface area [ see eq .",
    "( [ sj_def ] ) ] to subtract the volume in van der waals contact with the solvent .",
    "we show ( fig.[br.fig ] ) that this model reproduces well born radii computed from an accurate numerical representation of the sev , noting that improvements for the born radii of atoms in loosely packed hydrophobic interior , while significant , are still not optimal .",
    "although approximate , this representation of the sev maintains the simplicity and computational efficiency of pairwise descreening schemes , while accounting for atomic overlaps in a consistent and parameter - free manner .",
    "the new agbnp2 model has been formulated to be employed in molecular dynamics conformational sampling applications , which require potential models of low computational complexity and favorable scaling characteristics , and with analytical gradients .",
    "these requirements have posed stringent constraints on the design of the model and the choice of the implementation algorithms . in the formulation of agbnp2",
    "we have reused as much as possible well - established and efficient algorithms developed earlier for the agbnp1 model .",
    "for example the key ingredient of the hydrogen bonding correction function is the free volume of an hydration site , which is computed using a methodology developed for agbnp1 to compute atomic self - volumes .",
    "similarly the sev - based pairwise descreening procedure employs atomic surface areas ( see eq .",
    "[ sj_def ] ) , computed as previously described.@xcite agbnp2 suffers additional computational cost associated with the sev - based pairwise descreening procedure and the hydrogen bonding correction function .",
    "this handicap however is offset by having only one solute volume model in agbnp2 rather than two in agbnp2 .",
    "agbnp1 requires two separate invocations of the volume overlaps machinery [ eq .  [ v1 ] ] for each of the two volume models it employs , corresponding to the van der waals atomic radii for the pairwise descreening calculation and enlarged radii for the surface area calculation.@xcite agbnp2 instead employs a single volume model for both the pairwise descreening and surface area calculations .",
    "a direct cpu timing comparison between the two models can not be reported at this time because the preliminary implementation of the agbnp2 computer code used in this work lacks key data caching optimizations similar to those already employed in agbnp1 .",
    "given the computational advantages of the new model discussed above we expect to eventually obtain similar or better performance than with agbnp1 .",
    "the agbnp2 model has been parametrized against experimental hydration free energies of a series of small molecules and with respect to the ability of reproducing energetic and structural signatures of the conformational ensemble of three mini - proteins generated with explicit solvation .",
    "these data sources are chosen so as to ensure that the resulting model would be applicable to both hydration free energy estimation and conformation equilibria , which are fundamental characteristics for models aimed at protein - ligand binding affinity estimation .",
    "on the other hand , experimental hydration free energies and explicit solvent conformational ensembles are to some extent incompatible with one another given the limitations of even the best fixed charge force fields and explicit solvation models to reproduce experimental hydration free energies of small molecules with high accuracy.@xcite mindful of this issue we did not seek a perfect correspondence with the experimental hydration free energy values .",
    "we first obtained parameters by fitting against the small molecule experimental hydration free energies , then adjusted the parameters to improve the agreement with the explicit solvent data making sure that the predicted small molecule hydration free energies remained within a reasonable range relative to the experimental values . in practice this procedure yielded predicted hydration free energies in good agreement with the experimental values with the exception of the carboxylate and guanidinium ions ( see table [ tab.small.mol ] ) for which agbnp2 predicts more favorable hydration free energies than the experiments ; a consequence of the large hydrogen bonding corrections necessary to reduce the occurrence of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in the investigated proteins .",
    "as discussed further below , limitations in the description of hydration sites adopted for carboxylate and guanidinium ions may be partly the cause of the observed inconsistencies for these functional groups .",
    "parametrization and validation of the model focused in part on comparing the effective potential energy distributions of implicit solvent conformational ensembles with those of explicit solvent ensembles .",
    "we observed that the agbnp1 solvation model energetically ranked explicit solvent conformations significantly less favorably than implicit solvent conformations .",
    "the agbnp2 model is characterized by smaller energetic bias relative to the explicit solvent ensembles , indicating that conformational sampling with the agbnp2/opls - aa energy function produces conformations that more loosely match those obtained with explicit solvation .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of employing the more realistic solvent excluding volume description of the solute which yields larger born radii for buried groups , as well as the hydrogen bonding to solvent corrections , which favor solvent exposed conformations of polar groups .",
    "furthermore , comparison of the energy distributions of the agbnp2 and explicit solvent ensembles for the three mini - proteins ( fig.[agbnp2de.fig ] ) shows , in contrast to the agbnp1 results , that the agbnp2 bias for the two more charge - rich mini - proteins ( cdp-1 and fsd-1 ) is similar to that of the least charged one ( trp - cage ) .",
    "this suggests that the residual energetic bias of the agbnp2 model is probably related to the non - polar model rather than the electrostatic model .",
    "future studies will address this particular aspect of the model .",
    "the energy scoring studies conducted in this work indicate that agbnp2 is a significant improvement over agbnp1 .",
    "they also show , however , that the new model falls short of consistently scoring explicit solvent conformations similarly to implicit solvent conformations .",
    "although an optimal match between energy distributions is a necessary condition for complete agreement between implicit and explicit solvation results , it is unrealistic to expect to reach this ultimate goal at the present level of model simplification . increasing the magnitude of the hydrogen bonding corrections can improve the agreement between the explicit and implicit solvation energy distributions , albeit at the expense of the quality of the predicted small molecule hydration free energies .",
    "it seems likely that the no parametrization of the current model would yield both good relative conformational free energies and hydration free energies .",
    "future work will pursue the modeling of additional physical and geometrical features necessary to improve the agreement between implicit and explicit solvation energy distributions .",
    "the energy gap between the implicit solvent and explicit solvent energy distributions used here is , we believe , a meaningful measure of model quality and could serve as a useful general validation tool to compare the accuracy of implicit solvent models .",
    "the excessive number of intramolecular electrostatic interactions involving charged groups has been one of the most noticeable shortcoming of gb - based implicit solvent models.@xcite to correct this tendency we have in the past adopted in the agbnp1 model ad - hoc strategies aimed at either destabilizing electrostatic intramolecular interactions@xcite or , alternatively , stabilizing the competing solvent - separated conformations.@xcite this work follows the latter approach using a more robust and physically - motivated framework based on locating and scoring hydration sites on the solute surface as well as adopting a more realistic volume model .",
    "structural characterization of the conformational ensembles has shown that agbnp2 produces significantly fewer intramolecular interactions than agbnp1 reaching good agreement with explicit solvent results .",
    "the reduction of intramolecular interactions has been the greatest for interactions between polar and charged groups .",
    "we believe that the excessive tendency toward the formation of intramolecular interactions to be the root cause of the high melting temperatures of structured peptides@xcite predicted with agbnp1 . given the reduction of intramolecular interactions achieved with agbnp2 , we expect the new model to yield more reasonable peptide melting temperatures ; a result which we hope to report in future publications .",
    "less visible improvements have been obtained for ion pairs involving arginine sidechains which remain more stable with implicit solvation than explicit solvation . however , significantly , with agbnp2 we observed a more dynamical equilibrium between ion - paired and solvent - separated conformations of arginine sidechains that was not observed with agbnp1 .",
    "this result is promising because it indicates that the agbnp2 solvation model , although still favoring ion paired conformations , produces a more balanced equilibrium , which is instead almost completely shifted towards contact conformations with agbnp1 .",
    "nevertheless it is apparent that the agbnp treatment of the guanidinium group of arginine is not as good as for other groups .",
    "this limitation appears to be shared with other functional groups containing sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms as evidenced for example by the relatively lower quality of the hydration free energy predictions for amides and nitrogen - containing aromatic compounds ( table [ tab.small.mol ] ) .",
    "similar implicit solvent overstabilization solvation of arginine - containing ion pairs has been observed yu et al.@xcite in their comparison of surface generalized born ( sgb ) and spc explicit solvation with the opls - aa force field . despite quantitative differences , the explicit solvent studies ( with the tip3p water model ) of masunov and lazaridis@xcite and hassan@xcite , using the charmm force field , and that of mandell at al.@xcite , using the opls - aa force field , have confirmed that arginine forms the strongest ion pairing interactions , especially in the bidentate coplanar conformation .",
    "these observations are consistent with the present explicit solvent results using opls - aa and the spc water model , where we find that most of the ion pairs of the mini - proteins were found to involve arginine sidechains . in contrast to our present implicit solvent results , however , the work of masunov and lazaridis@xcite indicated that the gb - based implicit solvent model that they analyzed@xcite produced potentials of mean force for arginine - containing ion pairs in general agreement with explicit solvation .    to rationalize the present implicit solvent results concerning ion pair formation , it has been instructive to analyze the potentials of mean force ( pmf ) of ion pair association with the agbnp model . as an example , fig .",

    "the corresponding explicit solvent pmf obtained by mandell et al.@xcite is also shown in fig.[pmfs1.fig ] for comparison .",

    ", it also reproduces the solvation barrier of the pmf at @xmath159   separation , corresponding to the distance below which there is insufficient space for a water layer between the ions .",
    "it is in this range of distances that the greatest discrepancies are observed between pmf s with explicit solvation and some gb - based implicit solvation models@xcite that do not model effects due to the finite size of water molecules .",
    "both the hydrogen bonding correction and the sev volume description employed in agbnp2 , which are designed to take into account the granularity of the water solvent  the hydrogen bonding correction through the minimum free volume of water sites [ eq.([hb_corr_energy ] ) ] and the sev model through the water radius offset [ eq .  ( [ big_radii ] ) ]  make it possible to reproduce the solvation barrier typical of molecular association processes in water .",
    "the good correspondence between the agbnp2 and explicit solvent pmf s for propyl - guanidinium and ethyl - acetate ( fig .  [ pmfs1.fig ] ) stand in contrast with the residual agbnp2 overprediction of arginine salt bridges compared to explicit solvation ( table [ hbt.table ] ) .",

    "we have confirmed that the pmf of ion pair formation for an angled conformation ( not shown ) indeed shows a significantly more attractive contact free energy than the coplanar one .",
    "this result indicates that the in - plane placement of the hydration sites for the carboxylate groups ( see appendix ) does not sufficiently penalize angled ion pair arrangements .",
    "this observation is consistent with the need of introducing of an isotropic surface - area based hydration correction for carboxylate groups ( the reduced @xmath133 parameter for the carboxylate oxygen atoms ) , which showed some advantage in terms of reducing the occurrence of salt bridges .",

    "<S> the agbnp2 implicit solvent model , an evolution of the analytical generalized born plus non - polar ( agbnp ) model we have previously reported , is presented with the aim of modeling hydration effects beyond those described by conventional continuum dielectric representations . a new empirical hydration free energy component based on a procedure to locate and score hydration sites on the solute surface is introduced to model first solvation shell effects , such as hydrogen bonding , which are poorly described by continuum dielectric models . </S>",
    "<S> this new component is added to the generalized born and non - polar agbnp models which have been improved with respect to the description of the solute volume description . </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced an analytical solvent excluding volume ( sev ) model which reduces the effect of spurious high - dielectric interstitial spaces present in conventional van der waals representations of the solute volume . </S>",
