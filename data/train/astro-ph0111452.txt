    "gravitational waves are a natural consequence of einstein s theory of general relativity ( einstein 1916 , 1918 ) .",
    "indirect evidence for their existence came first from observations of the orbital decay of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ( hulse & taylor 1974 , 1975a , 1975b ; taylor & weisberg 1982 , 1989 ) .",
    "direct detection though and analysis of gravitational - wave sources are expected to provide a unique insight to one of the least understood of the fundamental forces .",
    "they will also allow us to investigate the physical properties of astronomical objects that so far have been elusive because they do not emit any electromagnetic radiation ( e.g. , double black holes in isolation ) .",
    "a number of interferometers designed for gravitational - wave detection are currently in operation , being developed , or planned .",
    "first results from the japanese instrument tama300 have already been reported ( tagoshi et al . 2001 ) . more advanced ground - based observatories are under development or in the commissioning phase , i.e. , the us laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ; abramovici et al .",

    "2000 ) , a joint project of esa and nasa with the launch planned for 2009 .",
    "astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation relevant to ground - based interferometers include : inspiraling double compact objects , binary stars , rotating neutron stars , neutron star instabilities , supernovae , supermassive black holes and stochastic background ( for a review see thorne 1987 ) .",
    "some of the most promising candidates are the inspiral and coalescence of double compact objects ( dco ) , such as ns - ns ,",
    "bh - ns , and bh - bh binaries .",
    "successful detection of these sources at reasonable event rates depends not only on the instrument sensitivity and the strength of the gravitational - wave signals , but also on the coalescence rates and the physical properties of the sources out to the maximum distances of reach of a given instrument .",
    "coalescence rates of double compact objects have been investigated by a number of different groups . for ns - ns binaries",
    "the rates can be calculated in two ways : ( 1 ) theoretically , based on the predictions of binary population synthesis calculations ( e.g. , bethe & brown 1998 ; portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ; bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1999 ; belczynski & bulik 1999 ; fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) or ( 2 ) empirically , based on the observed sample of galactic binary pulsars ( e.g. , narayan , piran , & shemi 1991 ; phinney 1991 ; curran & lorimer 1995 ; arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman 1998 ; kalogera et al .",
    "2001 ; kim , kalogera , & lorimer 2001 ) . at present both methods",
    "appear burdened with significant uncertainties , the theoretical approach due to the many poorly constrained evolutionary model parameters , and the empirical estimates due to small - number sample of observed ns - ns systems ( for a more detailed discussion see kalogera et al .",
    "predictions for bh - ns and bh - bh binaries can be obtained only from theoretical calculations , since no such systems have yet been observed .",
    "accurate predictions for bh binaries are even harder to obtain , as the evolution of high - mass stars still challenge our understanding",
    ". several results of population synthesis calculations have been presented in the literature , for bh - ns systems : fryer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; belczynski , bulik & zbijewski ( 2000 ) ; portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) , and for bh - ns and bh - bh systems : lipunov , postnov & prokhorov ( 1997 ) ; de donder & vanbeveren ( 1998 ) ; nelemans , yungelson & portegies zwart ( 2001b ) .",
    "given the history of population synthesis calculations , one may wonder what is the purpose on another set of models of the formation of double compact objects .",
    "the primary goal of this present study is to investigate the relevant formation processes in the light of recent developments in the evolution of compact object progenitors in binaries , and to clearly identify classes of formation channels , their origin , and their relative contributions .",
    "we focus not just on predicted rates , but at some level more importantly on the physical properties of formed binaries .",
    "our parameter study is targeted to uncovering the systematic uncertainties as well as identifying those ( qualitative ) properties that appear to be robust .",
    "investigation of these properties will help in characterizing the range of possible gravitational - wave signals and identification of their origin will allow reevaluating our results in the future as our understanding of model unknowns improves . as part of our analysis",
    "we also examine the implications of common - envelope phases involving helium stars and as a result we identify a number of new formation channels with important implications for the properties of double compact objects . even though stellar structural characteristics may tentatively support such common - envelope phases late in the evolution of helium stars",
    ", we note that detailed hydrodynamical calculations will be needed to assess the viability of such phases involving helium stars or pairs of evolved stars as it has been assumed also in earlier studies ( see fryer et al.1999 ; nelemans et al .",
    "2001a )    our paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we present a detailed description of our population synthesis code ( named _ startrack _ ) . in ",
    "3 we : describe the extent of our parameter study (  3.1 ) , discuss the statistical accuracy of our calculations (  3.2 ) , present the formation paths of double compact objects (  3.3 ) , and analyze in detail their properties (  3.4 ) and coalescence rates (  3.5 ) for a large number of different models . in  4 , we discuss the implications of the most important of our results and conclude with prospects for gravitational - wave detection by ground - based interferometers .",
    "in all the population synthesis models , we employ the analytic formulae derived by hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 , hereafter hpt ) to model the evolution of single stars .",
    "these formulae represent fits to results from a large number of stellar evolution models calculated by pols et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using the eggleton stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971,1972,1973 ; latest updates and input physics described in han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 and pols et al .  1995 ) .",

    "allow us to calculate the evolution of a star given its zero age main sequence ( zams ) mass and its metallicity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "stellar evolution is followed from zams through a sequence of evolutionary phases depending on the initial ( zams ) stellar mass : main sequence ( ms ) , hertzsprung gap ( hg ) , red giant branch ( rg ) , core helium burning ( cheb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , which is further divided into early agb ( eagb ) and thermally pulsing agb ( tpagb ) , and for stars stripped off their hydrogen - rich layers : helium main sequence ( hms ) , helium giant branch ( hgb ) . we end the evolutionary calculations at the formation of a stellar remnant : a white dwarf ( wd ) , a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh ) . during the evolution we can track some of the basic stellar parameters : radius , luminosity , stellar mass , and core mass .",
    "these single star models include the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds as described in hpt .",
    "mass loss rates are adopted from the literature for different evolutionary phases . for h - rich stars on ms ( nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) ; using @xmath4 dependence of kudritzki et al .",
    "1989 ) , for rgb ( kudritzki & reimers 1978 ) and agb ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) stars , and for luminous blue variables ( hpt ) . for he - rich stars w - r , mass loss is included using rates derived by hamann , koesterke & wessolowski ( 1995 ) and modified by hpt . given the importance of single star winds in the formation of compact objects ( e.g. , brown , weingartner , & wijers 1996 ; ergma & van den heuvel 1998 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , we examine this element of single star evolution and calculate synthesis models with varying strengths of stellar winds .",
    "we have introduced two modifications to the hpt formulae concerning the treatment of ( i ) helium - star evolution , and ( ii ) final remnant masses .",
    "these are described in detail in the next two subsections .",
    "after core helium exhaustion low - mass helium stars expand significantly and develop a `` giant - like '' structure with a clearly defined core and a convective envelope ( delgado , & thomas 1981 ; habets 1987 ; avila - reese 1993 ; woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "radial expansion is very important for stars in binaries as it may lead to mass transfer episodes .",
    "low - mass evolved helium stars with convective envelopes possibly transfer mass on a dynamical time scale , and as a consequence a common envelope ( ce ) phase may ensue . on the other hand , relatively massive helium stars do not develop deep convective envelopes and do not experience any significant radial expansion .",
    "even if they happen to initiate mass transfer ( mt ) , they respond differently to mass loss and a ce phase is not likely .",
    "based on the hpt formulae , the implied upper mass limit for helium stars to develop deep convective envelopes is @xmath5 ) , which we consider to be rather low .",
    "we have examined in detail models of evolved helium stars ( woosley 1997 , private communication ) and found that helium stars below 4.0m@xmath6 have deep convective envelopes , whereas slightly more massive helium stars ( @xmath7 44.5m@xmath6 ) still form convective envelopes , although shallower . as an example",
    ", an evolved helium star of @xmath8 develops a deep convective envelope reaching down almost to the core through 90% of the stellar radius .",
    "based on this , for our standard model , we adopt @xmath9 for an evolved helium star to develop a deep convective envelope .",
    "however , in face of the uncertainties and the importance of helium - star evolution , we treat this value as a model parameter and include it in our parameter study . throughout this paper",
    "we refer to the evolved helium stars with @xmath10 as low - mass helium stars / giants ( or low - mass hgb stars ) and to the stars with @xmath11 as massive helium stars / giants ( or massive hgb stars ) .",
    "we note that , apart from the issue of convective envelopes , a comparison in terms of radial evolution alone between the hpt formulae and other published models of helium stars ( e.g. habets 1987 ) shows excellent agreement , so we adopt these formulae in calculating stellar radii .",
    "detailed discussion of helium star evolution in context of double compact objects formation is given in belczynski & kalogera ( 2001 ) .",
    "the masses of ns and bh calculated by hpt are _ very _ small . for progenitors of @xmath12",
    ", they obtain final remnant masses in the range @xmath13 , ( see their figure 20 ) . on the other hand , measurements of bh masses in binaries ,",
    "although still highly uncertain , yield much higher values : @xmath7 3@xmath14 ( orosz et al . 2001 ; mcclintock et al . 2001 ; froning & robinson 2001 ; wagner et al .",
    "2001 ; table 1 of fryer & kalogera 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the hpt analytic formulae are based on the stellar models evolved at least to the formation of a carbon - oxygen ( co ) core , and these core masses are in good agreement with earlier stellar models ( e.g. , schaller et al .",
    "therefore , instead of using their somewhat arbitrary prescription ( see their equation [ 75 ] ) for ns and bh masses , we adopt a different formula derived on the basis of core - collapse hydrodynamical calculations ( fryer 1999 , fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "we note that there are still many uncertainties associated with the physics of the supernova mechanism , and there is still disagreement among research groups about the cause of the explosion ( e.g. , liebendoerfer et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) . for our study",
    "we choose the specific core - collapse models , primarily because they are the only one available in the literature that allow us to calculate the remnant mass taking into account fallback , in a self - consistent way .",
    "we adopt the hpt formulae to calculate the final co core mass of a star , and we use stellar models of woosley ( 1986 ) to obtain a final feni core mass as a function of the co core mass . at the time of core collapse , we describe the star with its current mass @xmath15 , the final co core mass @xmath16 and the final feni core mass @xmath17 . to estimate the mass of the remnant formed , we follow the results of hydrodynamical calculations of core collapse ( fryer 1999 ) .",
    "these calculations have shown that ( i ) progenitors with @xmath18 do not experience any significant fall back and apart from the collapsing core , the stellar outer layers are expelled as sn ejecta , ( ii ) for progenitors with @xmath19 , the whole pre - collapse star directly implodes to form a bh and no sn event takes place , ( iii ) for intermediate progenitor masses remnants are formed through an initial core collapse and subsequent partial fall back .",
    "the outcome of a given core - collapse event is found to depend primarily on the core mass of the collapsing star and not on the initial ( zams ) stellar mass .",
    "taking into account that the stellar population models used by fryer ( 1999 ) were of constant mass ( without wind or mass transfer effects ; see fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , we have developed a prescription based on co core masses . using the hpt formulae we obtain @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 , for @xmath24 using the standard wind mass loss prescription .",
    "we then calculate the mass of the remnant as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the _ fall - back _ factor , i.e. the fraction ( from 0 to 1 ) of the stellar envelope that falls back . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the initial - remnant mass relation , for single population i stars ( @xmath24 ) , and for three different wind mass - loss rates .    the top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] shows the initial - remnant mass relation for our standard prescription of wind mass - loss rates .",
    "stars of @xmath27 0.50.8 @xmath28 form helium white dwarfs ( he wd ) , of @xmath27 0.86.3 @xmath28 form carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co wd ) , and of @xmath27 6.38.0 @xmath28 form oxygen - neon white dwarfs ( one wd ) .    for stars with initial mass @xmath29 in excess of 8 @xmath30 ,",
    "the stellar core mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass and once nuclear reactions stop the core collapses into a ns . for @xmath31 , the outer stellar layers ( on average @xmath32 )",
    "are lost in sn explosion , and no fall back takes place .",
    "this part of the initial - remnant mass relation is characterized by a slow increase of the ns mass with increasing @xmath33 , as more massive progenitors form only slightly more massive cores , which eventually collapse to ns .",
    "partial fall back is initiated above @xmath34 and the amount of material accreted back onto the collapsing core increases linearly with increasing progenitor mass . due to the fall",
    "back the initial - remnant mass relation significantly steepens over @xmath34 .",
    "note that the remnant mass reaches maximum ns mass @xmath35 at @xmath36 , so in this model the most massive ns are formed through fall back .    for @xmath37",
    "there is a small drop and a subsequent flattening of the initial - remnant mass relation . at this and higher",
    "progenitor masses stellar winds strip star completely of its hydrogen layers . once a naked helium star is formed the wind mass loss rate increases significantly .",
    "the effect of wind mass loss enhancement with increasing @xmath29 diminishes both the final core mass and the pre - collapse envelope mass ( the fall back mass reservoir ) and therefore decreases the remnant mass . with increasing @xmath29 the fall back",
    "factor @xmath26 goes up , but because of the helium star mass loss rate effect on the pre - collapse star , the remnant mass does not increase as fast as before .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath38 collapse directly into a bh at the end of their evolution .",
    "the initial - remnant mass relation flattens out even more .",
    "this is a consequence of a `` fall - back saturation '' .",
    "the fall back is now complete ( @xmath39 ) and can not increase any more with progenitor mass , as it was the case for less massive stars in the range of partial fall back .",
    "now the remnant mass depends only on the pre - collapse mass , which increases rather slowly with progenitor mass as the wind mass loss rate increases also with @xmath29 .",
    "stars over @xmath40 reach high luminosities and radii exceeding the humphreys - davidson limit ( humphreys & davidson 1994 ) and enter the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase . during the lbv",
    "phase stars lose mass at a very high rate , which result in a sudden drop in the initial - remnant mass relation . due to this significant mass loss , stars over @xmath41 form smaller cores and experience partial fall back at core collapse .",
    "the effect of lbv - like mass loss takes over the effect of an overall increase of co core mass ( and thus remnant mass ) with @xmath29 , and it influences the remnant mass in two ways .",
    "first , lbv - like mass - loss rates increase with increasing stellar mass leading to a decrease of remnant masses .",
    "second , for higher stellar zams masses , the lbv phase begins earlier in the life of a star .",
    "hence , the stars are stripped of their hydrogen layers earlier , and less massive helium stars are formed , leading to a decrease in remnant masses . in the standard wind model ,",
    "remnant masses reach their local minimum at @xmath42 , when the lbv phase sets in the earliest possible , i.e. , at the beginning of hertzsprung gap . for more massive stars ,",
    "the overall increase of remnant mass with progenitor mass dominates once again , as co core masses steadily grow and the contribution of fall back steadily increases .    for progenitors with @xmath43 remnants",
    "are once again formed through complete fall back and the initial - remnant mass relation flattens out , following the slow increase of pre - collapse mass with @xmath29 .    in the middle panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "results are shown for wolf - rayet mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of two .",
    "the initial - remnant mass relation changes only slightly from that of the top panel as partial fall back at high zams masses is eliminated .",
    "as expected , compact objects are slightly more massive and the maximum bh mass increases from @xmath44 ( top panel ) to @xmath45 ( see also wellstein & langer 1999 ) .    in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "results are shown for the case of all wind mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of two , and we find some significant changes in the initial - remnant mass relation .",
    "first , as expected , the compact object masses are higher than for both models described above ; the maximum mass of the compact object in this model increases to @xmath46 .",
    "second , the qualitative shape of the relation changes . as in the standard wind model , we find two sudden drops in the relation , with the first one being more prominent than before . in the standard model the first drop corresponds to the stripping star of its hydrogen layers and the formation of a helium star , whereas the second drop is related to the onset of lbv phase for very luminous and extended stars .",
    "these two effects lead to significantly increased mass loss rates , and thus decrease the remnant masses .",
    "detailed examination of this model reveals that in the bottom panel , the first drop corresponds to the onset of the lbv phase and the second to the helium star formation .",
    "since all wind rates are reduced and wind mass loss rates depend strongly on the stellar mass , helium stars are exposed only for stars of higher initial mass .",
    "consequently , stars with much lower initial masses ( below @xmath47 ) retain their hydrogen - rich layers and are able to evolve to higher luminosities and larger radii , which shifts the onset of the lbv phase to lower initial masses .",
    "another difference is that , the immediate progenitors of compact objects tend to be more massive , and therefore direct bh formation spans much wider range of initial masses than for the standard wind model .",
    "these more massive progenitors form more massive co cores , and none of the factors that decrease pre - collapse masses are strong enough to decrease the co core masses below @xmath48 ( see eq .",
    "[ mrem ] ) .",
    "consequently , bh formation through partial fall back does not occur for two separate @xmath29 ranges ( as is the case for @xmath29= 2142 and 4872@xmath49 in the standard wind model ) .",
    "we use monte carlo techniques to model the evolutionary history of double compact objects and study their physical properties .",
    "we generate a large number ( @xmath50 ) of primordial binaries , drawing their initial physical parameters ( component masses , orbital separations and eccentricities ) from assumed distributions described in  2.2.2 . besides that",
    ", monte carlo events are used to _",
    "i ) _ set the time of birth of each binary in the disk of our galaxy ( for constant star formation rate the probability distribution of the birth time is flat in the range @xmath51gyr ) , _ ii ) _ set the kick velocity direction and magnitude each ns or bh receives when formed in an asymmetric sn explosion and _ iii ) _ set the position along the binary orbit in which sn take place . in all other instances , the evolution is modeled based on a set of formulae and prescriptions ( described in what follows ) that depend on the binary properties .    the evolution of each system is followed in a number of time steps .",
    "the time step is chosen to be a small fraction ( @xmath52 ) of the evolutionary phase lifetime of the more rapidly evolving stellar component , making sure that the relative change in radius is always less than @xmath53% .",
    "we start the evolution of a given binary with two components at zams , and we stop the calculation when the two components have formed stellar remnants or when a merger occurs or when the system has reached the present time , i.e. , the sum of its age and its birth time is equal to 10gyr ) .",
    "the evolution of each binary component in isolation is calculated as described in  2.1 , and a number of evolution effects on the binary orbit ( e.g. , mass and angular momentum losses due to stellar winds ) are taken into account . at every evolutionary time step , we check for possible binary interactions .",
    "if any of the components fills its roche lobe , we calculate the effects of mass transfer and possible mass and angular - momentum loss on the orbit . depending on the masses of the components and their evolutionary stage , we apply appropriate prescriptions for the modeling of different mass transfer events ( as described in  2.2.4 ) .",
    "if the binary survives the mass - transfer event ( i.e. , both stellar components fit within their roche lobes ) , we continue to model its evolution . at every time step",
    ", we also check the single - star models ( see  2.1 ) to determine if any of the components has finished its nuclear evolution , and has turned into a compact remnant .",
    "if a remnant is born in a sn explosion , we calculate the effects of sn kicks and mass loss on the binary orbit ( both circular and eccentric ) .",
    "if a binary is disrupted in sn explosion , we follow the single - star evolution of components , otherwise we continue with the evolution of the whole binary .",
    "once a binary consists of two remnants , we calculate its merger lifetime , i.e. , the time until the components merge due to gravitational radiation and associated orbital decay , and we study the properties and formation rates of different classes of binaries containing compact objects . in what follows",
    "we describe in detail prescriptions for binary evolution and all model assumptions as chosen for our standard model .",
    "the assumptions for models in our parameter study are given in  3.1 .",
    "a binary system is described initially by four parameters : the mass of the primary @xmath54 ( the initially more massive component ) , the mass ratio @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of the secondary ( initially less massive component ) , the semi - major axis @xmath57 of the orbit , and the orbital eccentricity @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that the initial distributions of these parameters are independent .    for both , single stars and binary system primaries",
    ", we adopt the initial mass function derived by scalo ( 1986 ) , @xmath59 in the mass range @xmath60 relevant to compact object formation .",
    "although , for single stars , the minimum initial mass for ns formation is @xmath61 ( or maybe higher ) , a lower limit of @xmath62 ensures that we do not miss any ns progenitors due to binary evolution .",
    "mass transfer in a binary can increase any component s mass , and effectively decrease the minimum initial mass of ns progenitors .",
    "let us consider a border - line case of the lowest - mass primary ( @xmath62 ) and the corresponding highest - mass secondary ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the primary evolves off the ms with a helium core of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in its envelope . for our standard model of binary evolution , we assume that only half of the donor envelope can be accreted by its companion ( see  2.2.4 ) .",
    "so for this border - line case , the initial secondary mass can be increased to @xmath65 , or for all other cases , to masses smaller than the mass limit for ns formation .",
    "following kuiper ( 1935 ) , we assume a flat mass ratio distribution , @xmath66 in the range @xmath67 . given value of the primary mass and the mass ratio , we obtain the mass of the secondary @xmath68 .",
    "we evolve only systems with secondaries of @xmath69 , as less massive stars will not evolve within a hubble time .",
    "the distribution of the initial binary separations is assumed to be flat in the logarithm ( abt 1983 ) , @xmath70 where @xmath57 ranges from a minimum value , such that the primary fills its roche lobe , up to @xmath71 .",
    "we adopt the thermal - equilibrium eccentricity distribution for initial binaries , @xmath72 in the range @xmath73 ( e.g. , heggie 1975 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "tidal circularization of binary orbits takes place in systems in where the size of any component is comparable to the binary separation ( zahn 1978 ) .",
    "this condition is satisfied when at least one of the binary components evolves beyond the ms or the initial binary separation is small . to calculate the effects of tidal circularization on a binary orbit we follow the prescription developed by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) : circularization occurs , if the stellar radius of one component is larger than @xmath74 of the periastron binary separation . the orbital elements ( @xmath75 ) change under conservation of angular momentum until the new periastron distance is equal to 5 stellar radii of the component driving the circularization , or until the orbit is circularized ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we also assume that tidal circularization takes place instantaneously ( i.e. in one evolutionary time step ) .",
    "stellar winds affect binary orbits through mass and angular - momentum losses . assuming a spherically symmetric stellar wind , which carries away the specific angular momentum of the mass - losing star , and a circular orbit ( jeans - mode mass loss ) , the change in the binary separation is given by @xmath77 for eccentric orbits the change in @xmath57 is rather similar ( vanbeveren , van rensbergen & de loore 1998 ) .",
    "orbits are also affected by mass transfer events and sn explosions .",
    "the treatment of these effects is described in the subsections that follow .",
    "when one of the binary components fills its roche lobe , mass is transferred to its companion through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "the responses of both components and the orbit as well as the outcomes of mt phases depend on the masses and evolutionary stages of the two stars . in our calculations",
    "we distinguish between ( i ) dynamically stable , in general non - conservative ( allows for mass and angular - momentum loss from the system ) mass transfer , and ( ii ) dynamically unstable mass transfer that leads to common envelope evolution ( for more details and reviews see , e.g. , ostriker 1975 , paczynski 1976 , iben & livio 1993 , rasio & livio 1996 ; taam & sandquist 2000 ) .",
    "we are interested in the end products of mt events , and therefore , we assume that mt takes place instantaneously .",
    "following any mt event , we update the binary component masses and evolutionary stages and calculate their radii .. we find that variation of this assumed value does not affect our results in any appreciable way ( even for an increase of this radius by an order of magnitude ) . ] using the post - mt radii and separation , we examine whether systems survived the mt event and a component merger was avoided .    _",
    "non - conservative stable mass transfer .",
    "_ this phase is implemented if ( i ) the donor is a ms or hms star transferring mass to an accretor of any evolutionary stage , or ( ii ) the donor is a h - rich or he - rich giant and the accretor is not , and the following is true @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the donor and accretor masses at the beginning of the mt episode .",
    "based on earlier results obtained by hjellming & webbink ( 1987 ) , kalogera & webbink ( 1996 ) and ritter ( 1999 ) , @xmath80 if the donor is in hg and the accretor is a ms star , and @xmath81 in all other cases .    during this type of mt episodes , part of the mass lost by donor ( @xmath82 )",

    "we assume that half of the mass lost from the donor is also lost from the system ( @xmath93 ) with specific angular momentum @xmath94 .    for ms and hms donors ,",

    "when either component of a binary reaches this stage , we generate a random location in the orbit for the event to take place ( note that for eccentric binaries this choice will affect the outcome , since the components separation and relative velocities are different at different locations in the orbit ) .",
    "the core - collapse event is assumed to be instantaneous and the mass of the remnant is calculated using equation  [ mrem ] .",
    "note that if the remnant is formed through complete fall back ( leading always to direct bh formation ) , we do not expect a sn explosion ( hence no kick and no mass loss ) and the orbit remains unchanged ( fryer 1999 ) .",

    "we calculate the effect of a sn event on binaries in three steps : ( i ) we estimate the mass of the remnant .",
    "the rest of exploding star is immediately lost from the binary ( with the angular momentum specific to the exploding component ) .",
    "we assume that the ejecta do not have any effect on the companion ( e.g. , kalogera 1996 ) .",
    "( ii ) we calculate the compact object velocity which is the vector sum of the orbital velocity of the pre - collapse star at the orbital position and the kick velocity .",

    "we use a kick magnitude distribution very similar to the one derived by cordes & chernoff ( 1998 ) : a weighted sum of two maxwellians , one with @xmath119 km  s@xmath120 ( 80% ) and the second with @xmath121  km  s@xmath120 ( 20% ) .",
    "this distribution accounts for the fact , that besides average velocity pulsars a significant fraction of neutron stars have velocities above 500 kms@xmath120 ( arzoumanian , cordes , & chernoff 1997 ) .",
    "( iii ) we calculate the total energy ( potential and kinetic ) of the new orbit for the remnant ( new velocity and mass , same relative position ) and its companion .",
    "if the total energy is positive , then the system is disrupted , and its components will evolve separately .",
    "we calculate their subsequent evolution as single stars , but we do not follow their trajectories in the present study . if the total binary energy is negative , the system after sn explosion is bound , and we calculate its new parameters ( @xmath58 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "we also check whether the two components have merged due to the sn mass loss and kick in which case we terminate the evolution .",

    "the limit @xmath124 ( accompanied by @xmath123 ) is unrealistic , since a merger occurs earlier , but the very final parts of this integration do not contribute significantly to the merger time , as the very late stages of inspiral proceed on very short timescales .",
    "for example , the merger time we calculate for psr  b1913 + 16 is within 1% of the result obtained by solving the system of two ordinary equations for the eccentricity and orbital separation ( e.g. , junker & schaefer 1992 ) .",

    "however , due to the small mass of helium giant envelope at the onset of ce event ( @xmath152 ) , we find that these systems survive the ce events , and form very tight ns - ns binaries ( see also footnote in  2.1.2 ) .",

    "the ns progenitors have lost both their hydrogen and helium envelopes prior to the two supernovae , so no accretion from winds or roche - lobe overflow is possible after ns formation .",

    "the most channel identified as the most efficient for ns - ns formation ( nsns:01 ) corresponds to the `` standard '' channel of fryer et al .",

    "had we not taken into account the radial expansion of low - mass helium - rich giants , the progenitors of this dominant ns - ns population would have evolved without any further mt . most of them would have still formed ns - ns systems , however , not as tight as after this last ce episode .",
    "we have actually examined this alternative and found that about half of them would have formed binaries with merger lifetimes longer than 10@xmath155yr . once again , we see the importance of helium star evolution on dco population synthesis",

    "1999 ) collapse to bh .",
    "furthermore our treatment of the hyper - critical accretion typically leads to tighter post - ce systems , causing more binaries to merge in ce events , and thus decreases the number of possible ns - ns progenitors .",
    "group ii strongly dominates the population of coalescing ns - ns systems ( 81% , for standard model calculation ) over group iii ( 11% ) and i ( 8% ) . in general",
    "this characteristic is preserved in all , except a few extreme evolutionary models .",
    "the discussion of the dependence of the formation rates of the various ns - ns subpopulations on population synthesis model assumptions will be presented in belczynski et al.2002a .",
    "in general , bh - ns and bh - bh binaries are formed through just a few distinct channels , with a moderate number of mt events ( 23 ) , in contrast to our findings for ns - ns systems .",
    "helium star evolution , radial expansion and ce phases are much less important for the formation of bh - ns and bh - bh binaries .",
    "the reason is that for most of these progenitors the first - born compact object is massive enough that even when helium stars evolve to the giant branch , they do not expand to large radii nor they lead to possible ce evolution ( see mt criteria in  2.2.4 and channel bhns:03 in table  [ channels ] ) . instead these dco form most efficiently through channels that closely resemble those ns - ns conventionally thought to be `` standard '' ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ; fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) : evolution is initiated with a phase of non - conservative mass transfer and followed either by a ce phase or the formation of the first compact object ( see bhns:01 , bhns:02 , and bhbh:01 , bhbh:02 ) .        _ standard model . _ in figure  [ fig2 ] , we present the mass distributions of dco components for our standard model , with first- and second - born compact objects in the top and bottom panel , respectively .    the shape of the calculated mass distributions can be understood as a convolution of the initial - remnant mass relation for single stars ( top panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) with the adopted initial stellar mass function ( see eq .",
    "[ imf ] ) .",
    "deviations from such a convolution reflect the effects of binary evolution on the compact object masses .",
    "first , we discuss the mass distribution of the second - born compact objects , as they are less affected by binary evolution .",
    "this distribution starts at the lowest possible ns mass ( allowed by our single star models ) of @xmath156 , rises sharply with a peak at @xmath157 and then declines down to @xmath158 ( the assumed @xmath98 for our standard model ) .",
    "this strong peak at low masses is the result of a rather weak dependence of ns mass on zams mass ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) combined with the steep imf . following the initial peak ,",
    "the distribution becomes flat in the range @xmath159 .",
    "this flattening is caused by the balanced effects of a slightly rising initial - remnant mass relation and a declining imf .    at @xmath160 the distribution peaks again , and then rapidly declines .",
    "this final peak corresponds to the saturation of bh masses at @xmath160 for a wide range of zams masses in the initial - remnant mass relation .    for the model described here ,",
    "the maximum mass of the second - born compact objects is @xmath161 , in excess of the maximum mass of @xmath162 of compact objects formed in single star evolution ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such slightly more massive compact objects are allowed only because of mt episodes involving their progenitors .",
    "in some cases they can accrete enough material to significantly increase the core mass ( rejuvenation through accretion ) , and form more massive remnants .",
    "the mass distribution of first - born compact objects shows more prominently the effects of binary evolution , since the compact objects themselves and not just their progenitors might have been affected by mass transfer events .",
    "the three basic qualitative features are still present , with an initial peak , a subsequent flattening , and a smaller final peak . however , there are two easily identified differences between the two distributions .",
    "first , the initial peak is lower and broader , and second , the peak at high masses shifts to @xmath163 , and the maximum compact object mass increases to @xmath164 .",
    "both effects are due to accretion onto the first - born compact objects from their non - degenerate companions .",
    "our standard - model mass distribution of compact objects in coalescing double compact objects peaks at @xmath165 for ns and then extends up to @xmath166 for bh .",
    "this agrees well with the observed ns masses in binary stars : @xmath167 ( e.g. thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) and also with estimated masses of black hole binary candidates : @xmath168 ( for references see  2.1.3 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the maximum bh mass of @xmath169 can be increased up to @xmath170 .",
    "this can be achieved either by decreasing the wind mass loss rate by factor of 2 ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) and/or by increasing the amount of material accreted by stars in non - conservative mt events .",
    "we can also compare results of our population synthesis calculations to the theoretical compact object mass distributions presented by fryer & kalogera ( 2001 , hereafter fk01 ; their figures 7 and 8) .",
    "we find some striking similarities .",
    "the single star initial - remnant mass relations are very similar as expected given that our calculation of compact object masses are based on the same core - collapse hydrodynamical calculations ( fryer 1999 ) .",
    "fk01 find that in the range of compact object formation 80% of their single star remnants are ns , and the rest are bh .",
    "we find that for the standard model of single star evolution 81% of remnants are ns , and 19% are bh .",
    "more importantly , the _ shape _ of the fk01 co mass distribution formed in the presence of stellar winds and binary companions , resembles our distribution , even though fk01 did not use population synthesis .",
    "apart from the qualitative similarities , we also note that our results confirm the findings of fk01 for a continuous mass distributions and the absence of a gap or isolated narrow spike at about @xmath171 , claimed by bailyn et al .",
    "recent observational results also point in the direction of a broader range of bh masses ( froning & robinson 2001 ; orosz et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , there are still two significant differences between our results and those of fk01 .",
    "one is related to the maximum bh mass ( about @xmath172 in fk01 compared to our @xmath173 ) and the other to the contribution of bh to the compact object population .",
    "both are linked to a number of binary interactions that are not taken into account by fk01 and have the effect of increasing the masses of compact objects . in our standard - model calculations",
    "we find that , in double compact objects , ns and bh represent 65% and 35% of the compact objects , respectively , because of accretion effects .",
    "in contrast , for the case in fk01 where effects of stellar winds and binary companions , the contribution of bh actually decreases compared to single star calculations .    _ parameter study .",
    "_ we have explored a large number of population models and have found that the main qualitative features of the mass distributions remain unaffected : the low - mass peak from ns formation and the flat form of the distributions for a wide range of bh masses are present in many different models ( e.g. , b1 , b12 , f2 , j ) .",
    "accretion effects and the less prominent peak at higher masses are also clearly seen in almost all of the models .",
    "nevertheless some dramatic quantitative differences are revealed by a few models . in the case",
    "that all wind mass - loss rates are increased by a factor of 2 ( g2 ) , the maximum compact object mass turns out to be only @xmath174 and therefore such a case appears to be highly unlikely . on the other hand ,",
    "the model where all wind mass - loss rates are decreased by a factor of 2 ( g1 ) allows for bh masses as high as @xmath175 .",
    "another class of models that show significant quantitative differences from the standard model are those with varying ce efficiencies , especially those with low values .",
    "the results for model e1 ( @xmath176 ) are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "although the basic shape of the distributions resembles that of the standard model , the second - born compact objects span a much narrower range in mass : @xmath177 ( with most of compact objects formed with mass smaller than @xmath178 ) .",
    "low ce efficiency discriminate against tight pre - ce systems , cause a large number of dco progenitors to merge , and therefore dco rates to decrease significantly . in particular , the effects appear to be most prominent for bh - bh binaries where massive second - born bh are essentially eliminated .",
    "as shown in  3.3 and table  [ channels ] most bh - bh progenitors experience first a non - conservative mt and then a ce episode . for the case of low ce efficiencies ,",
    "ce survival is favored for rather wide pre - ce systems with donors ( stars that initiate the ce episode and progenitors of the second - born compact objects ) with low envelope masses . in these cases",
    "ce ejection is facilitated , but at the same time lower mass progenitors are favored , leading to a restricted mass range for these second - born compact objects . at the same time",
    "the bias in favor of wide pre - ce systems translates to a bias in favor of progenitors where the first mt episode is initiated late in the evolution of the primary , when the stellar radii are larger and most of the stellar envelope has burnt into a high mass core .",
    "this bias clearly favors the formation of higher mass first - born compact objects , leading overall to bh - bh binaries with rather extreme mass ratios .",
    "given the sensitivity of the dco mass distribution to the ce efficiencies , it may be possible in the future to discriminate between models based on mass measurements of bh - bh binaries from gravitational - wave detections and data analysis .",
    "_ standard model .",
    "_ the distribution of dco over orbital separations at the time of their formation is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , for our standard model .",
    "the distribution for the whole population ( top panel ) covers a wide range of values @xmath179 and is characterized by two distinct peaks .",
    "it is evident from the bottom panel that the peak at shorter separations is due to ns - ns binaries and the one at wider is due to bh binaries .",
    "examination of the ns - ns distribution indicates that the majority of ns - ns systems , are formed with very small orbital separations ( @xmath180 ) , but there is a long tail stretching to much larger orbital separations ( even beyond @xmath181 ) .",
    "this result is related to our discussion of the main ns - ns formation channels (  3.3 ) .",
    "the ns - ns population consists of three distinctive groups ( see  3.3.1 ) , which shape the orbital separation distribution .",
    "`` classical '' ns - ns systems ( group iii ) that contain recycled pulsars have wide separations , mostly in the range @xmath182 ( where the two observed systems lie ) . however , ns - ns binaries in which none of the ns ever had a chance of getting recycled ( group i ) _ and _ very tight ns - ns binaries formed via the newly identified channels ( group ii ) actually dominate the produced ns - ns population and produce a strong peak at much lower orbital separations . these differences in orbital separations affect the derived merger times and have important implications for the detection of such systems , which we discuss in  3.5.2 .",
    "typical bh binaries have much wider separations than ns - ns systems ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is a result of the lower ( or zero ) sn kicks imparted to bh which allows the survival of wider progenitors , typical of the more massive binaries required for the formation of the bh binaries .",
    "note that bh - ns binaries tend to have intermediate size orbits , affected in part by the high kicks imparted to one of the two compact objects .",

    "the full range of separation values also appears to be robust ( 0.1100 r@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , the relative height of the two peaks varies significantly from model to model , primarily because of the varying contribution of different types of systems to the dco population .",
    "the reasons and a discussion of these variations are given in  3.5.1 .    here ,",
    "we identify a couple of extreme cases : in the models with zero kick velocities ( b1 ) or increased wind mass - loss rates ( g2 ) , bh binaries have a very small formation rate relative to ns - ns systems(see also portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ; fryer et al .  1999 ) , and therefore the ns - ns peak at shorter orbital separations strongly dominates .",
    "in contrast , models with low ce efficiencies hamper the formation of dco in tight orbits and the peak due to bh binaries strongly dominates . in model h2 ,",
    "as expected , the peak at low separations for ns - ns disappears altogether , since no helium - star ce episodes are allowed .      _ standard model . _ in figure  [ fig5 ] , we present eccentricity distributions of coalescing compact object binaries for our standard model",
    ". the values at the time of dco formation are quite high , @xmath183 for the majority of the population , and of course originate from the fact that the last stage prior to dco formation typically involves a sn explosion and asymmetric kicks .",
    "the fraction of dco formed in circular orbits is rather small , and occurs when the second compact object is formed through a direct collapse to a bh ( bh - bh : @xmath184 and bh - ns:@xmath185 ) .",
    "portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) and fryer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have also found that ns - ns population is born with high eccentricities , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "apart from the eccentricities at formation , we also examine the distribution at later stages when gravitational radiation has caused the binary orbit to shrink and the gravitational - wave frequency has increased to @xmath186hz , the lower end of the ligo i band .",
    "so far dco have been assumed to be circular for purposes of gravitational - wave detection and data analysis .",
    "we examine whether our model population satisfies this assumption due to angular momentum losses and circularization .",
    "we use the dependence of orbital separation on eccentricity due to gravitational - wave emission as derived by peters ( 1964 ) : @xmath187^{870/2299},\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is given in equation  [ mergtim ] and depends on the orbital separations and eccentricities at dco formation .",
    "we use our results for the masses to calculate first the orbital separation at 40hz and the corresponding frequency .",
    "the resulting distribution is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "it is clear that by the time these coalescing dco enter the ligo i band , the eccentricities are small enough ( @xmath189 ) that the assumption of circular orbits is well justified .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the eccentricity distribution at birth is single - peaked , the distribution at later stages becomes double - peaked .",
    "this is a direct result of the double - peaked form of the orbital separation distribution . in more detail ,",
    "the peak at lowest eccentricities is populated by the heavier bh binaries and the peak at somewhat higher eccentricities by ns - ns binaries .",

    "as expected , the typical eccentricities at formation decrease with a decreasing average kick magnitude .",
    "the variations in the shape and position of the eccentricity peaks for later stages are more prominent and closely follow the corresponding variations in the distributions over orbital separations .",
    "nevertheless , the eccentricities at 40hz remain below @xmath190 for all the models we have examined .",
    "_ standard model .",
    "_ binaries are expected to acquire systemic ( center - of - mass ) velocities after core - collapse events because of the combined effects of mass loss and sn kicks imparted to the compact remnants .",
    "understanding of these velocities is crucial in studies of dynamical evolution of these populations , and their kinematic properties and spatial distributions with respect to host galaxies .",
    "the distributions of center - of - mass velocities after the first and second core - collapse events are shown in figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "top panels on both figures show the distribution for the whole dco population , and bottom panels show the distributions separately for each of the dco groups .",
    "it is evident that there are major differences between the two plots .",
    "the distribution after the first core - collapse event ( v@xmath191 ) shows a well defined narrow peak at low velocities ( @xmath192 ) and a slowly decaying tail at higher velocities . after the formation of the second compact object velocities ( v@xmath193 )",
    "populate a much broader peak positioned at high magnitudes ( @xmath194 ) with a velocity tail reaching to very high velocities ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "moreover , in these distributions a narrow spike at @xmath196 is also identified .",
    "all these characteristics can be naturally explained by the different binary orbital properties of binaries at the time of the first and the second compact object formation . for the majority of dco progenitors ,",
    "the first core - collapse event happens when the binary orbit is still wide , accommodating two massive stars and is affected primarily by mass loss through winds and non - conservative mass transfer events .",
    "the typical orbital velocities in these pre - collapse systems are @xmath197kms@xmath120 and it is mostly these orbital velocities that determine the typical post - collapse systemic velocities of bound systems ( kalogera 1996 ) . for maxwellian kick magnitude distributions an upper and lower limit on the systemic velocity can be derived analytically and it is found to be independent of the average kick magnitude ( depends only on the stellar masses and the pre - collapse relative orbital velocity ; see kalogera 1996 ) . as a secondary effect , within the range of values defined by these two limits ,",
    "systems tend to acquire higher systemic velocities when higher kicks are imparted . a smaller fraction of dco progenitors experience a ce phase prior to the first core - collapse event , and have much tighter orbits ( orbital velocities of order @xmath198kms@xmath120 ) , leading to higher systemic velocities .",
    "the more subtle influence of the average kick magnitude is evident when looking at the distributions for each dco class , where ns - ns progenitors are slightly shifted to higher and bh binaries to lower systemic velocities ( ns - ns progenitors tend to be lighter than bh - bh progenitors ) .    at the time of the second sn explosion ,",
    "the population of compact object binary progenitors is dominated by tight binaries with relative orbital velocities in the low hundreds .",
    "the result is a strong , broad peak at @xmath199kms@xmath120 with a tail to higher velocities ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "systems with lower systemic velocities do form , but the majority of them are so wide that their merger times exceed the hubble time . another noticeable difference from figure  [ fig6 ] is that the bh - ns population now closely follows the ns - ns population .",
    "this is understood as both the pre - collapse orbital characteristics and the typical kick magnitudes are similar for these two populations at the second compact object formation , since in the majority of bh - ns systems the ns is formed second .",
    "it is evident that typically bh - bh binaries acquire the lowest systemic velocities .",
    "this is a result of three combined effects : they are formed from wider progenitors (  3.4.2 ) , they are heavier systems , and some bh are formed via direct collapse and hence do not acquire any kick . strikingly , in both figures  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] , there is a prominent spike at zero systemic velocity , which is populated by bh - bh systems where both bh were formed via direct , assumed to be symmetric collapse .",
    "we note that , although these systems tend to be wider than ns - ns , they still merge within a hubble time because of the higher masses , hence stronger gravitational radiation involved .",
    "it is useful to note one other implication of the small systemic velocities after the first core - collapse event .",
    "these combined with the fact that the time between the two collapse events is much shorter than typical coalescence times , implies that it is the systemic velocities after the second collapse ( along with the merger times ) that determine the spatial distributions of dco merger sites with respect to host galaxies .",
    "portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) presented results on ns - ns systemic velocities , and fryer et al .",

    "_ the distribution of systemic velocities after the first core - collapse event is found to be very robust in our parameter study .",
    "the most clear , but not big , changes in the distribution shape are visible in models which affect the pre - sn orbital separations , e.g. in models e1 and f2 . for these models ,",
    "the distribution starts with an initial peak , as for the standard model , however the high velocity tail is depleted at velocities below 100150 kms@xmath120 .",
    "all of dco progenitors experience either ce phase or mt event prior to the first sn explosion .",
    "decreasing the ce efficiency ( model e1 ) or increasing the fraction of mass accreted by companions in mt events ( model f2 ) lead to a decrease in post - ce or post - mt separations .",
    "therefore , at the time of the first sn explosion , progenitors have higher orbital velocities , and dco progenitors in models e1 and f2 end up with higher systemic velocities than in the standard model , depleting the distribution of low velocity values . some small changes are also seen with kick magnitude variations .",
    "for very small kicks , the high velocity tail of the standard model distribution disappears , whereas , for very high kicks , many more systems are disrupted , but most of the ones that survive the collapse , end up with somewhat higher systemic velocities . as a result , the low velocity peak of the distribution is depleted and the tail extends to higher velocities .    similarly , the qualitative features of the distributions after the second compact object formation are robust , with an exception for the spike at zero velocity , the presence of which depends on the contribution of bh - bh binaries to the dco population ( e.g. , models b1 , b6 , b13 , d2 , f2 , j , and the extreme case of g2 where essentially no bh - bh binaries are formed ) . for a few models , we find some significant differences , but are all explained by the relative contribution of the various dco groups .",
    "for example , for very high kicks ( model b12 ) and in the absence of helium - star ce phases ( model h2 ) , the formation rate of coalescing ns - ns is so small that the velocity distribution is dominated by bh - bh binaries , and in particular those which do not receive a kick ( i.e. , the zero - velocity spike becomes most dominant ) .",
    "the few surviving ns binaries populate a much broader range of systemic velocities with low normalization and a roughly flat tail out to hundreds of kms@xmath120 .      _ standard model . _",
    "the distributions of merger times ( see eq .",
    "[ mergtim ] ) of coalescing dco are shown in figure  [ fig8 ] , for our standard model .",
    "the double - peaked form is due to the two main populations of ns - ns systems and bh binaries and their double - peaked distributions of orbital separations . as already mentioned the ns - ns population",
    "is dominated by tight binaries formed through channels involving mt episodes from helium stars .",
    "these tight orbits imply very short merger times with a peak at @xmath202myr . despite their higher masses",
    "bh - ns and bh - bh binaries are found to have merger times typical of @xmath203gyr , driven by their wider orbits and the stronger dependence of merger time on separation .",
    "merger times also decrease with increasing initial eccentricities , leading to a stronger separation of the two peaks , since ns - ns binaries tend to have not only tighter orbits , but also higher eccentricities .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig8 ] , we present the merger times of three different populations of coalescing ns - ns binaries ( see  3.3.1 ) : group i of tight , non - recycled ns - ns binaries ; group ii of tight binaries formed through the newly identified channels ; and group iii of ns - ns formed through `` classical '' channels .",
    "it is evident that the large relative contribution of the tight ns - ns binaries drives the typical ns - ns merger times down to values close or below 1myr , whereas the `` classical '' ns - ns have merger times typical of the bh binaries .",
    "the identification of these short - lived binaries has important implications for the detectability of coalescing ns - ns binaries ( see  3.5.2 ) .",
    "both , portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) and fryer et al .  ( 1999 ) , presented merger time distributions of ns - ns binaries .",
    "they obtained typical times much longer than ours , close to 1001000 myr .",

    "_ unlike all other binary properties we have examined , the qualitative characteristics of the merger - time distributions appear to be rather sensitive to a number of model parameters .",

    "[ fig9 ] , we show three of the most different dco merger time distributions from models with somewhat extreme assumptions .    in the top panel of figure  [ fig9 ] ( model with zero kicks , b1 ) , the dco population is dominated by the ns - ns binaries , causing at first a sharp rise followed by a slow decline at longer merger times ( compare to the middle panel of figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the flattening of the distribution at @xmath204  myr is due to the small contribution of bh - ns and bh - bh systems to the dco population in this model . in the model shown in the middle panel ( model f2 ) ,",
    "all dynamically stable mt episodes are assumed to be conservative .",
    "the distribution is rather flat over a wide range of merger times and this is mainly a result of the assumption of conservative mt and the wider orbits that form as a consequence . in the bottom panel ,",
    "we show results from a model with low ce efficiency ( model e1 ) .",
    "it is evident that the distribution is depleted of short merger times .",
    "in contrast to the previous two models , the population is dominated by bh - ns and bh - bh systems , which have in general wider initial separations , and thus longer merger times than ns - ns binaries .",
    "model h2 ( no helium - star ce phases ) shows a very similar behavior with the peak at short merger times disappearing .    other models lead to the double - peaked distributions similar to our standard - model results .",

    "for our standard model ( a ) , rates were calculated from a very large number of primordial binaries ( @xmath151 ) and sub - samples of dco formed from each of @xmath149-binaries runs were used to examine and ensure the statistical accuracy of the results ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "all other rates are based on models with @xmath50 primordial binaries . for each model",
    ", we have also evolved an equal number of single stars , except for models k1 - 2 , for which we appropriately adjusted the contribution of single stars based on the assumed binary fraction .    in figure",
    "[ fig10 ] , we illustrate the rate dependence on the assumed kick velocity distribution . there is an overall decrease of rates with increasing kick velocity for every population of coalescing double compact objects , as the disruption probability for pre - collapse systems increases with higher kick magnitudes .",
    "it is worth noting though that at small kicks ( from zero to average magnitudes of @xmath207kms@xmath120 ) rates are found to increase .",
    "this is due to the importance of kicks in creating tight binaries with merger times shorter than a hubble time ( see fryer & kalogera 1997 and fryer et al .  1999 in the ns - ns case ) .",
    "rates remain roughly constant for @xmath208kms@xmath120 , as the two effects balance one another .",
    "it is also notable that the rate decrease is steeper for ns - ns binaries , and progressively flattens for bh - ns and bh - bh binaries .",
    "this is a result of the lower kick magnitudes assumed to be imparted to bh .",
    "for very high kick magnitudes ( maxwellians with @xmath209 ) , bh - bh systems start dominating the population , as most of the ns - ns progenitors get disrupted .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , lipunov et al .",
    "1997 ; portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 ; fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) . in figure  [ fig10 ]",
    ", we also plot the rates from our standard model ( kicks similar to the results by cordes & chernoff 1998 ) and the model b13 with `` paczynski - like '' kicks .",
    "it is evident that , despite the very different shape of these distributions , they closely correspond to maxwellian kicks with @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "this result once again indicates that the kick distributions are narrowly `` filtered '' by dco binary properties : only binaries receiving kicks similar to their orbital velocities have a good sn survival chance ( kalogera 1996 ) .",
    "the match between these two models and the specific @xmath138-values of the maxwellians indicates that the normalizations in the velocity range of interest happen to be very similar and the shape of the distributions outside this range becomes irrelevant .",
    "the effects of hyper - critical accretion combined with the assumed maximum ns mass can be understood on the basis of the results of models c and d1 - 2 .",
    "we find that hyper - critical accretion in ce phases not only increases the mass of the inspiraling compact objects and can convert ns to bh , but also leads to somewhat wider post - ce systems because part of the envelope is accreted and does not need to be expelled at the expense of orbital energy . in model c , we do not allow for any hyper - critical accretion and we find that the rate of ns - ns and bh - ns systems decreases whereas the rate bh - bh binaries remains unaffected .",
    "this combination indicates that it is the effect on the orbital period ( increased rate of post - ce mergers ) that dominates over the reduction of ns conversions to bh .",
    "bh - bh systems originate from wider progenitors and therefore are not much affected .",
    "the reduction in ns conversions to bh turns out to be unimportant because the assumed maximum ns mass is rather high and the rate of conversions is low in the standard model ( only 5% of all ns entering ce phases ) .",
    "in contrast , when the maximum ns mass is reduced to 2m@xmath6 and 1.5m@xmath6 ( models d1 and d2 ) , 34% and 80% respectively of ns entering ce phases collapse into bh . in these two models",
    "there is also a clear decrease in the rate of ns binaries and increase of the bh - bh coalescence rates , whereas the total dco coalescence rates remain essentially constant ( within our statistical accuracy , see  3.2 ) .",
    "the effects of varying the effective ce efficiency ( models e1 - 3 ) are qualitatively similar to not allowing for hyper - critical accretion ( model c ) .",
    "coalescence rates tend to decrease with decreasing ce efficiency because of an increased rate of ce mergers .",
    "the main difference with model c is that the bh - bh rates are altered here .",
    "this is because varying the ce efficiency by factors of 2 or more affects post - ce binary separations much more than decreasing envelope masses of an ejected envelope by a few tenths of a solar mass in model c.    in models f1 - 2 and l1 - 2 , we vary the parameters governing mass loss in non - conservative mt episodes , and in particular in model f2 , we obtain results for conservative mass transfer .",
    "most of the ns - ns progenitor systems ( @xmath212 ) start their mass transfer history with a non - conservative exchange , and therefore their coalescence rates might be altered . also for many other compact binary progenitors ,",
    "non - conservative mass transfer phases may take place , particularly at the early stages of binary evolution , when the primary expands and evolves toward the red giant branch while its companion is still on the main sequence .",
    "however , non - conservative mass transfer phases do not drastically change the orbital separation , so we find that the overall coalescence rates do not change by much .",
    "comparison to our standard model shows a depletion in coalescing bh - bh systems for both f1 - 2 and l1 - 2 models , and also moderate decrease of ns - ns binaries for the f1 and l2 models .",
    "coalescence rates of bh - ns binaries are not significantly altered .",
    "the similarities of the results come from the same effect that the fact that the f and l model parameters affect post - mt orbital separation in a similar way . in models",
    "f , we vary @xmath213 , the amount of material which is accreted onto the companion star , while in models l , we change the specific angular momentum @xmath214 of the material lost from system during mt ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "both an increase of @xmath213 ( f2 ) and decrease of @xmath214 ( l1 ) lead to an increase of the final post - mt orbital separations . on the other hand , both a decrease of @xmath213 ( f1 ) and increase of @xmath214 ( l2 ) lead to a decrease of the final post - mt separations .",

    "note , that orbital separations also depend on the mass ratios , but here we only discuss the changes relative to the standard model .",
    "it turns out that these orbital separation changes have different effects on different dco populations . for ns - ns progenitors ,",
    "pre - mt orbits are already relatively tight , so in models f1 and l2 ( f2 and l1 ) the ns - ns rate decreases ( increases ) as the frequency of mergers increases ( decreases ) .",
    "progenitors of bh - bh systems are more massive and generally have wider orbits at the onset of mt episodes compared to the progenitors of ns - ns binaries . given the decreased post - mt separations of model f1 and l2 , the bh - bh rate drops as in the case of ns - ns systems and for the same reasons .",
    "however , for the increased post - mt separations of model f2 and l1 , the bh - bh rate drops as well , this time due to the fact that many final bh - bh binaries are not tight enough to coalesce within the hubble time .",
    "variation of wind mass loss rates ( models g1 and g2 ) affects more strongly the rates of bh binaries , which decrease with stronger mass loss .",
    "the extreme case of wind losses even stronger than in our standard model entirely eliminates the bh - bh population , but increases the overall dco rate , mainly because survival through ce phases and sn events is facilitated ( lower - mass envelopes ) .",
    "as we pointed out in  2.1.2 ( see also belczynski & kalogera 2001 ) , the maximum mass of helium stars that develop convective envelope is somewhat uncertain ( thought to lie within the range of @xmath216m@xmath6 ) , and therefore we treat it as a model parameter .",
    "we find that reducing this value to @xmath145 ( model h1 ) results in ns - ns coalescence rate decreased by 30% .",
    "this is expected since many of the ns - ns formation channels ( see table  [ channels ] ) involve ce evolution of helium stars , which is aborted in the absence of convective envelopes .",
    "if we further eliminate the possibility of ce evolution even for low - mass helium stars ( model h2 ) , the ns - ns coalescence rate drops to @xmath217myr@xmath120 .",

    "we find that all coalescence rates are increased because a larger fraction of them had enough time to evolve and have total lifetimes shorter than 10gyr",
    ".    as expected , a flatter imf ( model j ) favors the formation of ns and even more of bh , so the contribution of bh - bh and bh - ns systems increases as the overall dco coalescence rate increases as well .",
    "varying the binary fraction affects the overall normalization of our population synthesis models .",
    "binary systems mostly contribute to type ib / c sn and therefore an increased binary fraction decreases the absolute number of type ii sn in the model and , for an assumed type ii sn normalization ( based on the empirical estimates ) , leads to an increase of the coalescence rates .    in model",
    "n , we see that rates of systems containing bh are similar to those of the standard model . however , the rates of ns - ns are much depleted .",
    "this is due to the fact , that in model n , with no helium star radial expansion , the ns - ns progenitors avoid the last ce episode of standard model formation channels .",
    "therefore , many ns - ns systems of model n are not tight enough to merge within the hubble time .    in models",
    "m , where we used different distributions for the initial binary mass ratios , the total dco coalescence rates are reduced or increased , depending on whether extreme mass ratios ( small @xmath218 values ) are favored or not . in model m1 the mt events are generally dynamically unstable , leading very often to mergers long before compact object systems form .",
    "evolution of model o influences only systems containing a bh , as in this model we have allowed for bh formation only through partial fall back . in the standard model , some bh were formed through a direct collapse of a massive star , and no kick was imparted to such bh nor any material was lost from the binaries . extending",
    "the influence of bh formation through partial fall back increases the overall probability that binaries are disrupted .",
    "thus coalescence rates of bh - ns and bh - bh binaries in model o are lower .",
    "coalescence rate estimates based on the observed sample of close ns - ns systems need to account for all possible observational biases acting against their detection .",
    "systems with two ns are discovered as binary pulsars .",
    "the two coalescing systems that have been observed in the galactic observed sample of ns - ns systems contain recycled ns with long pulsar lifetimes ( @xmath219  yr ) and long merger times ( @xmath220  yr ) , and empirical estimates are obtained under the assumption that the observed systems are representative of the galactic population ( kalogera et al .",
    "2001 ) .    as emphasized in our earlier work ( belczynski & kalogera 2001 ) , empirical coalescence rate estimates could be increased in light of the new short - lived ns - ns sub - populations identified in studies of their formation .",
    "_ rate - increase factors _ can be calculated to account for the populations of ( i ) non - recycled ns - ns , and ( ii ) tight ns - ns binaries with very short merger times formed through the new formation channels identified in the present study . because of their highly reduced lifetimes ( pulsar and merger ) , the detection efficiency for these ns - ns sub - groups is practically diminished ( drops by @xmath221 orders of magnitude ) .    in table",
    "[ corr ] , we present galactic coalescence rates of : non - recycled ns - ns , tight ns - ns binaries with merger times shorter than 1 myr , and the complete ns - ns population . in the last column of table  [ corr ]",
    "we give the correction factors for empirical coalescence rates calculated from : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the rate of all coalescing ns - ns binaries , @xmath224 is the rate of coalescing non - recycled ns - ns ( group i ) , @xmath225 is the rate of systems ( of group ii and iii ) with merger times smaller than @xmath226  myr .",
    "these correction factors imply an increase of the ns - ns rate estimated empirically based on the observed ns - ns with long pulsar and merger lifetimes .",
    "it is evident from table  [ corr ] that systems formed through the new `` helium - star '' channels ( group i and ii ) contribute the most to the correction factors .",
    "our standard model prediction is that empirical rates may be increased by a factor of 2.5 to account for short - lived ns - ns pulsar systems .",
    "although the correction factors change significantly for a few of the models , i.e. , from 1.4 to 6.1 for models with different ce efficiency ( e13 ) , they remain roughly constant at @xmath227 for most of the models in our parameter study . only for the nonphysical model n , with no helium star radial evolution , the correction factor is found as expected to be 1.0 .",
    "note that even for model h2 ( no helium - star ce evolution ) there is a small fraction of short - lived systems ( primarily due to kicks instead of ce orbital shrinkage ) and the correction factor is 1.1 . in model",
    "n no correction is needed , as in this model we do not form any ns - ns binaries in groups i nor ii , and both these groups are primarily responsible for the increase factors ( see also footnote in  2.1.2 ) .    for our correction - factor estimates",
    "we have conservatively assumed ( i ) that a recycled ns is formed in _ all _ ns - ns binaries in which the first - born ns had an opportunity to interact with its non - degenerate companion , even though this may not be true ( given our limited understanding of recycling we can not be certain ) .",
    "we characterize non - recycled ns - ns only systems that evolved through a double ce phase involving two helium stars ( channels nsns:09 , nsns:11 , and nsns:12 ) ; ( ii ) that systems with merger times longer than 1myr can detected with the same efficiency as much longer lived binaries , even though in reality there is a continuum , given the continuous distribution of merger times ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) . because of these two assumptions we should consider the derived upwards correction factors to be rather conservative and represent more of lower limits than rough estimates .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated the rates of type ii sn and type ib / c sn to be @xmath228 snu and @xmath229 snu for sbc - d galaxies , where 1 snu corresponds to one sn per 100 yr and the estimates are normalized to a blue luminosity of @xmath230 . for an estimated galactic blue luminosity of about @xmath231 ( van der kruit 1987 ;",
    "although see footnote in  3.5.1 ) , we obtain 1.72 and 0.28 snu for type ii and ib / c sn , respectively .",
    "the ratio of type ii to type ib / c sn turns out to be quite uncertain : @xmath232 .",
    "note that this ratio is independent of the assumed blue luminosity for our galaxy .    in our population synthesis calculations",
    "we keep track of all sn events .",
    "we use type ii events to normalize our models and then combine them with the type ib / c rates to derive the model - predicted ii - to - ib / c ratios .",
    "we find them to lie in the range @xmath233 , for all the models in our parameter study , with the standard model yielding a ratio of 2.6 .",
    "although our predicted ratio values are consistent with the empirical estimates within the associated errors , we note that the theoretical values tend to be systematically lower than the empirical estimates , implying that our ib / c rates are rather high .",
    "in retrospect , this is actually expected given some of the assumptions in the mt events .",
    "we note that in dynamically stable and unstable mt episodes , we assume that the donors are always stripped of their envelopes . however , it is not at all clear that this is a realistic assumption in small cases and it is quite possible that a small fraction of the h - rich envelope remains with the post - mt / ce donors . since our classification of sn events as type ib / c is based on the exploding stars having lost their h - rich and/or he - rich envelopes , it is possible that we are overestimating the ib / c events because of this assumption .",
    "we note , however , that all our models remain consistent with the empirical rates within the estimated errors .",
    "another explanation for the possible overabundance of type ib / c sn in population synthesis model has been provided by de donder & vanbeveren ( 1998 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with their findings of ii - to - ib / c ratios of 2 - 3 .",
    "the explanation they offered was related to possible variations of massive binary formation in galaxies over a range of morphological types and to the empirical estimates representing an average over many galaxies and not being appropriate for our galaxy . however , in their study de donder & vanbeveren ( 1998 ) considered the results obtained by ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1993a , b ) that were available at the time .",
    "in contrast , the most recent study of empirical sn rates ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) accounts for different morphological types of galaxies , possibly implying that the mt assumptions ( common to our and the de donder & vanbeveren 1998 study ) may be primarily responsible for the calculated sn small rate ratios .",
    "galactic sfr have been estimated to lie in somewhat broad ranges of @xmath234 ( blitz 1997 ; lacey & fall 1985 ) and @xmath235 ( gilmore 2001 ) .",
    "we use the calibration to the type ii sn rate by cappellaro et al .",

    "if we assume that the imf continues as a steep power - law down to the hydrogen - burning mass limit , we obtain values in the range @xmath237 , which is clearly significantly higher than current estimates for the galactic sfr .",
    "based on the results of scalo ( 1986 , see also kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1993 ) , the imf is thought to flatten for masses below about 1.0m@xmath238 . with the assumed flattened imf of kroupa et al.(1993 )",
    ", we obtain much lower sfr values in the range of @xmath239 , with the standard model prediction of @xmath240 . moreover , had we adopted the lower , by a factor of two , blue luminosity of our galaxy ( see kalogera et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) the predicted sfr would decrease ( by the factor of two ) even further .",
    "we note the good agreement of the galactic sfr estimates with our predictions for a flattened imf .",
    "in  3.4 we compared our results for the physical properties of dco populations to those of earlier studies wherever possible . in this subsection",
    "we explicitly focus on such a comparison based on results for coalescence rates from the following studies : lipunov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 , hereafter pzy ) , de donder & vanbeveren ( 1998 , hereafter ddv ) , fryer et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter fwh ) , and nelemans et al .",
    "lipunov et al .  (",
    "1997 ) focused their study on the effect of sn kicks on coalescence rates of double compact objects .",
    "their calculations showed that , in general , the rates decrease approximately exponentially with increasing kick magnitude .",
    "this finding is in very good agreement with our calculations ( see  3.5.1 and figure  [ rates1 ] ) .",
    "we also see that the behavior of _ relative _ coalescence rates of ns - ns to bh - ns binaries is quite similar to what we obtain here . in both studies ,",
    "the ratio of rates ( ns - ns to bh - ns ) decreases with increasing average kick velocity .",
    "however , the absolute coalescence rates differ and this is easily understood as a result of different population synthesis assumptions , important for the calculation of coalescence rates",
    ". in particular , lipunov et al .  (",
    "1997 ) use quite different compact object formation scenarios , as well as a different imf .",
    "pzy studied the formation and evolution of ns - ns and bh - ns binaries and included a limited parameter study .",
    "nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001b ) calculated populations of galactic binaries with white dwarfs , ns , and bh , and estimated the low - frequency gravitational - wave emission of these binaries .",
    "they used a population synthesis code similar to that of pzy , with few modifications concerning bh formation .",
    "although , many of the population synthesis assumptions differ , we find some similarities in the results . in general , rates of ns - ns binaries are higher than those of the bh - ns systems .",
    "however , in all pzy models ns - ns dominate over bh - ns binaries , which is not true for all of our models mainly because of our more extensive parameter study .",
    "moreover , on average the rates obtained by pzy are smaller than ours , but for some comparable models they differ only by factors of a few .",
    "this is due to the newly identified population of ns - ns binaries , as well as to the other differences in model assumptions .",
    "pzy note that due to hyper - critical accretion onto ns in ce phases , the population of bh - ns may dominate over ns - ns systems . although , they do not perform actual calculations of hyper - critical accretion events ( they assume that ns always collapse to bh ) , their results are in agreement with ours , provided that the maximum ns mass is rather low ( smaller than 2.0 @xmath142 , see rates of models d1 and d2 in table  [ rates1 ] ) .",
    "the predicted bh - bh coalescence rates are diminishingly small in both studies ( bh - bh binaries form but in very wide orbits with merger times longer than a hubble time ) .",
    "this is the combined result of a number of factors : in these two studies bh are assumed to form ( i ) symmetrically and no birth kicks are taken into account , and ( ii ) only from progenitor stars more massive than 40m@xmath6 , which biases the population to lower frequencies _ and _ wider orbits .    with respect to the ddv study , we note the difference between formation rates that correspond to the entire population and coalescence rates that correspond to the subgroup with coalescence times shorter than a hubble time .",
    "ddv reported formation rates and hence a direct comparison with their results is difficult .",
    "overall their formation rates are very high ( not only compared to our results but also all the other population studies ) : @xmath241  ns - ns , @xmath242  bh - ns and @xmath243  bh - bh systems per myr in galaxy .",
    "ddv comment that their bh - bh formation rate is surprisingly high .",
    "one reason may be their calibration method based on an assumed massive star formation rate of one massive star per year .",
    "this does not easily transform into a star formation rate as used in this work and consequently makes the comparison very difficult .",
    "fhw focused their work to the study of gamma - ray burst progenitors and among them ns - ns and bh - ns binaries .",
    "they performed quite an extensive parameter study and calculated coalescence rates for all their models .",
    "once again , we note the very similar dependence of their rates and ours on the average kick magnitude .",
    "one striking difference comes with the very wide ranges of their predicted rates ( e.g. , their 4 orders of magnitude change of ns - ns coalescence rate compared to about 2 orders of magnitude found here ) .",
    "the enormous spread of rates in the fhw work comes from the fact , that in one of their models they , non - physically , increased ( by factor of four ) the maximum stellar radii to explore the uncertainty related to radius determination in evolved stars .",
    "such a change significantly affects the evolution of many binaries , since the stellar radius is a crucial quantity in judging on the occurrence or non - occurrence of one of the most important binary processes : mt events .",
    "the radii we calculate for stars come from the stellar evolution models , and they depend on the star mass , its evolutionary stage , and its composition , and they are not altered in any nonphysical way . however , the fwh models of varied radii show the sensitivity of the results of population synthesis to this parameter , which is not very well constrained by stellar evolution models .",
    "the results on coalescing compact object binary rates are in good qualitative agreement with previous theoretical predictions . although we have noted some systematic differences we are able to attribute them to the different population synthesis model assumptions , as well as to the effects of the newly identified populations of ns - ns binaries .",
    "close binaries of ns and bh have attracted an increased interest in recent years primarily because of their connection to gravitational - wave detection and possibly to gamma - ray burst progenitors . here",
    "we focus the discussion of our results in the context of gravitational - wave detection by the upcoming ground - based interferometers ( e.g. , ligo ) and the prospects of detecting inspiraling dco .",
    "an analysis of these and other populations in connection to gamma - ray bursts is presented in belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002c and perna & belczynski 2002 .",
    "our motivation in initiating this study was to examine dco populations in view of some developments in the understanding of ce evolution , particularly the possibility of double ce ejection ( suggested by brown 1995 ) and hypercritical accretion ( suggested and quantified by chevalier 1989 , 1993 ; brown 1995 ; bethe & brown 1998 , and in the present study ) , and the evolution of low - mass helium stars .",
    "some , although not all , of these possibilities have been explored in some of the earlier population synthesis studies , but not in a consistent and equally detailed way ( mostly some extreme cases have been examined ; for example , either hyper - critical accretion has been ignored or all ns entering a ce have been assumed to collapse to bh ) .",
    "our goal is primarily two - fold : ( i ) to examine the predicted rates for various dco classes , focusing mainly on the relative formation frequencies and their behavior with a large number of model parameters , and ( ii ) to examine in detail the physical properties of the various populations , the origin of their characteristics , and the links to certain key evolutionary effects or phases , and to identify the most robust of the qualitative features in the distributions of binary properties .    in the course of our investigation we came across a number of new formation channels leading to rather efficient formation of ns - ns binaries .",
    "apart from an increase in the predicted rates , examination of their properties revealed that in their majority these ns - ns binaries form a very distinctive class with tight orbits and short merger timescales ( i.e. , lifetimes ) .",
    "the common thread connecting all these new formation paths is the evolution of low - mass helium stars and the implications of the fact that they can develop partially or fully convective envelopes .",
    "we find that a large number of mt episodes initiated by these evolved stars lead to high survival rate through a ce phase and the production of very tight binaries , which in turn have very high survival probability through the second core - collapse event .",
    "further , following the basic argument made by brown ( 1995 ) we have allowed for the possibility of two giant stars ( he - rich more relevant to efficient dco formation , but also h - rich ) involved in the dynamically unstable mt to eject the two combined common envelopes .",
    "it is these possibilities that lead to qualitative changes in the dco population characteristics , which have been discussed above .",
    "it is important to acknowledge that the viability of these new formation channels has not been examined with detailed evolutionary and hydrodynamical calculations . despite the difficulties of fully understanding the details of ce phases , questions such as : `` are dce events realistic ? '' ,",
    "`` can evolved helium stars survive a ce phase ? '' , and `` under what conditions ? '' , are currently traceable ( model h2 corresponds to the case of the answers to the above questions being no for helium stars ) .",
    "it seems that such investigations are necessary before we can include these new channels as part of what is considered `` standard '' ways of forming dco .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to examine the implications of such evolutionary phases ( see also fryer et al",
    ".  1999 ; nelemans et al .",
    "2001a ) .    in the context of gravitational - wave detection from inspiraling ns - ns binaries",
    ", these relatively short - lived systems imply that empirical rates derived based on the observed sample ( with much longer lifetimes ) should possibly be raised by factors of 2 - 3 typically .",
    "the reason is that they correspond to a galactic ns - ns population that is not represented in the observed binary pulsar sample but would very well contribute to inspiral events . using the results of kalogera et al.(2001 ) for the empirical ns - ns coalescence rate , we find that their _ most optimistic _",
    "prediction for the ligo i detection rate could be raised to at least 1 event per 2 years , and their _ most pessimistic _ ligo ii detection rate could be raised to 5 events per year or even higher .    in table",
    "[ ligo1 ] and table  [ ligo2 ] we present our theoretical predictions of detection rates of different binary merger types for ligo i and ligo ii , respectively .",
    "these detection rates correspond to our coalescence rates of double compact objects calculated with the _ startrack _ population synthesis program . using the extragalactic extrapolation of kalogera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the maximum sensitivity distances of ligo i and ligo ii for a given binary merger type ( see kalogera & belczynski 2001 ) , we converted our galactic coalescence rates to detection rates .",
    "we find that the ligo i detection rates are quite low with a _ maximum",
    "_ total rate of a couple events per year and with rates significantly below 1 event per year for many models .",
    "however , we find that the prospects for double compact object inspiral detection are very encouraging for ligo ii , for which we predict at least @xmath0 detections per year , even in the most pessimistic case . moreover , for ligo ii , the total detection rate of compact object binaries is as high as few hundred events per year for most of our models .",
    "the uncertainties of population synthesis method ( reflected on the predicted detection ranges ) seem much reduced compared to the earlier results ( see fryer et al .",
    "1999 ; kalogera et al .",
    "this is related to the fact that in the present study we adopted a given set of single star evolution models ( however note that we did explore the effects of varying wind mass - loss rates and helium - star evolution ) , and we have adopted a physically motivated initial - remnant mass relation based on hydrodynamical calculations of core - collapse events . in light of some indicative results from rotating star models ( heger , langer & woosley 2000 ; heger & langer 2000 ) , we can expect stellar evolution models to be updated in the future and we would regard this as progress in the field .",
    "we regard the investigation of the physical properties of dco as important as that of the rates and quite revealing in terms of their origin and robustness .",
    "the details have already been discussed earlier in the paper . from the point of view of gravitational - wave astrophysics , we hope these results will open new directions in anticipating and understanding properties of gravitational - wave sources . for example , distributions over components masses can be used to produce fake inspiral data to test the data analysis tools currently under development or evaluate detection efficiencies ( we are currently involved in such an activity already planned within the ligo scientific collaboration as part of the preparation for the ligo i scientific run in 2002 ) .",
    "predictions for physical properties can be used in developing specialized data - analysis tools to explore an astrophysically motivated parameter space , in cases where the unrestricted parameter space of inspiral signals is just far beyond any current or near - future computational capabilities ( see kalogera 2000 ) . looking a little more into the future , in the era when gravitational - wave astronomy is possible and physical properties are measurable , the identification of strong qualitative features ( such as those discussed here : relative contributions of dco classes , or presence or absence of certain peaks and other features )",
    "will allow us to evaluate some of the surviving theoretical models .",

    "<S> a new generation of ground - based interferometric detectors for gravitational waves is currently under construction or has entered the commissioning phase ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama ) . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of these detectors is to observe gravitational waves from astrophysical sources and help improve our understanding of the source origin and physical properties . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the most promising candidate sources for these detectors : inspiraling double compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> we use population synthesis methods to calculate the properties and coalescence rates of compact object binaries : double neutron stars , black hole - neutron star systems and double black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the formation channels available to double compact object binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly account for the evolution of low - mass helium stars and investigate the possibility of common - envelope evolution involving helium stars as well as two evolved stars . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we identify a significant number of new formation channels for double neutron stars , in particular , leading to populations with very distinct properties . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the theoretical and observational implications of such populations , but we also note the need for hydrodynamical calculations to settle the question of whether such common - envelope evolution is possible </S>",
    "<S> . we also present and discuss the physical properties of compact object binaries and identify a number of robust , qualitative features as well as their origin . using the calculated coalescence rates we compare our results to earlier studies and derive expected detection rates for the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our most optimistic estimate for the first ligo detectors reach a couple of events per year and our most pessimistic estimate for advanced ligo detectors exceed @xmath0 events per year . </S>"
