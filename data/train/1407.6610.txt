    "in a counting experiment , the detector response to a trigger signal is saved , whenever at least one among ( possibly many ) different conditions is satisfied .",
    "the trigger requirements are defined in such a way to select interesting `` events '' and operate the detector in the most efficient way .",
    "counting experiments are widespread in high - energy physics and astrophysics , and sometimes have to deal with very low event rates .",
    "this is the case , for example , when one tries to observe a very faint gamma - ray source with a space experiment , or when the goal is to detect the excess of counts corresponding to a new particle created by the collisions produced by underground particle accelerators .",
    "when only few events are collected , the asymptotic espressions which can be used with high count rates can not be adopted any more .",
    "instead , it is of great importance to study the correct statistical model without simplifying assumptions which could invalidate the result . for counting experiments , it is commonly assumed that the integer number @xmath0 of observed events follows the poisson distribution : @xmath1 where the real value @xmath2 is the poisson parameter , which coincides with the expected number of events and with the variance : @xmath3 = v[n ] = a$ ] .",
    "realistic measurements always involve some degree of `` background '' counts , due to non - interesting events which satisfy ( hopefully , but not always , with low probability ) some trigger condition .",
    "we assume that the counts from the source of interest and those from the background are independent poisson variables .",
    "a well known property of the poisson distribution is that the sum of two independent variables is again poisson distributed , with parameter given by the sum of the respective expectations : @xmath4 where the expected number of events from the source @xmath5 is the parameter of interest , and the background contribution @xmath6 is the nuisance parameter ( @xmath7 is integer , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real numbers ) .    in high - energy astrophysics , it is common to estimate @xmath9 with the help of auxiliary measurements , obtained by pointing the detector off the source . in this case",
    ", it is assumed that the source of interest does not contribute to the observed @xmath10 counts , such that one has a simple poisson process : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the expected ( background - only ) photon count in the region off the source . by knowing the details ( like the area on the sky and the exposure time ) of the source and off - source regions , it is possible to relate the expected counts from the background alone in the two regions : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant , assumed to be perfectly known ( i.e. with negligible uncertainty compared to @xmath15 ) .    in summary , the statistical inference about this ``",
    "on / off '' measurement makes use of the observed counts @xmath7 and @xmath10 in the source and off - source regions , of the known proportionality @xmath14 between the expected background fluxes in the two regions , and of the poisson models ( [ eq - model ] ) and ( [ eq - poisson - bkg ] ) for the two measurements .",
    "recently , @xcite ( mk2014 hereafter ) summarized the previous approaches to the on / off inference problem and proposed an objective bayesian solution which consists of two different steps .",
    "first , it is checked whether the number @xmath7 of events in the source region is too high to be comfortably attributed to the background alone .",
    "if this is the case , one rejects the `` null hypothesis '' ( background only ) and claims a successful observation of the source .",
    "next , the source intensity @xmath8 is estimated with the help of the auxiliary measurement .",
    "the good point is that mk2014 finds a ( rather complicate ) analytic solution to the bayesian inference problem , in terms of special ( gamma and hypergeometric ) functions which are available in many libraries .",
    "the procedure proposed by mk2014 is well motivated and it aims at achieving very desirable goals .",
    "however , it is not free from issues .",
    "the first source of possible troubles is the proposed prior [ eq .  ( 15 ) of mk2014 ] , which is obtained following the jeffreys rule in the bidimensional @xmath16 space [ called @xmath17 in mk2014 ] .",
    "even though jeffreys priors have a number of desirable properties for 1-dimensional problems , it is well known that they behave badly in multidimensional problems [ for a recent discussion , see @xcite ] .",
    "here we overcome this difficulty by reducing the problem to a 1-dimensional ( marginal ) model for which an objective prior is known .",
    "one further complication in the procedure proposed by mk2014 is the comparison of the null hypothesis @xmath18 that @xmath19 ( called `` background - only hypothesis '' here ) against the alternative hypothesis @xmath20 that @xmath21 in the target region ( the `` source+background hypothesis '' ) . in absence of additional information",
    ", mk2014 assigns identical ( prior ) probabilities to the two hypotheses : @xmath22 .",
    "they are `` nested '' hypotheses , in the sense that @xmath18 assumes a single value whereas @xmath20 allows the source strength to assume any other value in its domain .",
    "the fact that the measure of the allowed domain is zero for @xmath18 gives troubles when using improper priors[(see for example @xcite and references therein ] .    to overcome the problem ,",
    "mk2014 fixes the ratio between the arbitrary scale factors of the source and background priors with a procedure relying on the assumption that , when no counts are observed both in the target and off - source regions , the probabilities of @xmath18 and @xmath20 stay the same .",
    "this assumption is questionable , as counting zero events is not the same as performing no measurement .",
    "if the outcome is @xmath23 in the auxiliary region , we learn that the background in the source region is very small ( possibly negligible ) , and this may imply a better sensitivity ( see appendix  [ sec - ul ] for more details ) .",
    "in addition , if we count @xmath24 events in the source region , we know that there is no background contribution in this outcome and also that there is no count due to the source ( which makes it easy to get an upper bound to its intensity ) .",
    "thus , intuitively one may think that the absence of counts in the target region decreases the probability that a source is actually there , hence increasing @xmath25 , contrarily to mk2014 .",
    "although this way of thinking might also be criticized , what matters here is that the assumption , that measuring zero counts in both regions does not update our degree of belief about the validity of both the background - only and the source+background hypotheses , is questionable and can not be taken as a basis for the hypothesis test .    in this paper , we present the objective bayesian approach based on the analytical solution of model ( [ eq - model ] ) in the framework of the bayesian reference analysis @xcite obtained by @xcite ( dc2012 hereafter ) . this solution is based on the `` reference prior '' corresponding to the model given in equation  ( [ eq - model ] ) , which has a solid formal justification and does not suffer from the problems of multidimensional jeffreys priors .",
    "in addition , frequentist coverage studies have been carried on by dc2012 and show a good average agreement between the posterior probability and the coverage ( exact agreement is not possible , as this is a discrete problem ) .",
    "the reference prior computed by dc2012 may be coded in any programming language ( a c++ version is adopted here ) , and is also available in the bayesian analysis toolkit @xcite . for the users of other analysis frameworks and/or programming languages , it may be useful to know that simple approximations also exist , which are even quicker to compute @xcite .    to illustrate the application of the objective bayesian approach of dc2012 and compare to mk2014",
    ", our solution will be applied in a simplified way ( i.e.  in a single - step procedure ) to the same gamma - ray burst ( grb ) data listed in table  1 of mk2014 .",
    "the marginal reference posterior probability density of the source strength @xmath8 will be estimated directly , without comparing @xmath18 against @xmath20 . similarly to mk2014 , the posterior distribution for @xmath8 will be summarized by providing its mode , i.e.  the most probable value or peak position , together with highest posterior density ( hpd ) intervals , which are the narrowest intervals covering a predefined posterior probability .",
    "whenever one of such intervals is limited by zero at the left , its right edge automatically provides an upper bound to the source intensity . provides details about upper limits . ] in this case , it will be assumed that no source was detected , so that the alternative hypothesis of source+background is discarded . in our conservative approach ,",
    "when the posterior for @xmath8 suggests a non - negligible intensity we check the statistical significance of the excess of counts with respect to the background - only hypothesis to decide whether to claim a successful source detection or not .",
    "this procedure provides results which are essentially equivalent to the two - steps approach involving the comparison of two hypotheses , without the complications arising from the latter in the presence of improper priors ( as it is the case for the on / off problem ) .",
    "we have two poisson models , characterizing a region where no source contribution is expected , eq .",
    "( [ eq - poisson - bkg ] ) , and the target region where a source may produce counts in addition to those coming from the background alone , eq .",
    "( [ eq - model ] ) .",
    "the available data are the number @xmath7 of photons detected when pointing to the source ( called @xmath26 in mk2014 ) , the @xmath10 off - source counts ( called @xmath27 in mk2014 ) , and the ratio @xmath28 ( called @xmath29 in mk2014 ) between the background fluxes in both regions . one first has to estimate the background in the target region with the help of the auxiliary off - source measurement .",
    "next one considers the marginal model obtained by integrating over @xmath9 and finds the reference prior for @xmath8 . finally , one gets the reference posterior for @xmath8 with the help of bayes theorem .",
    "the auxiliary measurement is analyzed first .",
    "the poisson distribution ( [ eq - poisson - bkg ] ) allows to estimate the off - source background intensity @xmath15 by means of the bayes theorem : @xmath30 ( we omit the proportionality constant , as the latter can be determined by imposing that the integral of @xmath31 be one ) .",
    "this equation expresses the posterior probability density function @xmath31 of the off - source background intensity @xmath15 given the @xmath10 observed counts , in terms of the likelihood function ( [ eq - poisson - bkg ] ) and of the prior density @xmath32 .    if we have some prior estimate of the background flux in the off - source region , it is most convenient to represent it with a gamma distribution ( the conjugate prior of the poisson model ) : @xmath33 with shape parameter @xmath34 and rate parameter @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", the posterior also belongs to the gamma family , with new shape and rate parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , corresponding to @xmath10 observed counts .",
    "for example , the prior parameters @xmath38 can be fixed with the the method of moments , by imposing values for the prior expectation @xmath39=s / r$ ] and variance @xmath40=s / r^2 $ ] .    in absence of prior information , it is best to adopt an objective prior .",
    "the reference prior for the poisson model coincides with jeffreys prior , which is the limiting case of a gamma function with shape parameter @xmath41 and rate parameter @xmath42 .",
    "hence we use here the ( improper ) jeffreys prior @xmath43 and find the ( properly normalized ) density which represent the solution of bayes formula ( [ eq - off - posterior ] ) : @xmath44 this is the reference posterior for the background in the off - source region , and the same solution is used in mk2014 ) above . ] .",
    "our goal is to estimate the source intensity @xmath8 in the target region .",
    "we use the bayes theorem to write the joint posterior density in the source region as @xmath45 later , we will integrate over @xmath9 to find the marginal posterior density @xmath46 . hence we need to find the prior @xmath47 by translating the background estimate in the control region into a background estimate in the target region . in order to do so , we use the posterior density @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ eq - off - posterior-2 ] ) to determine the prior for the background contribution @xmath9 in the source region . with the change of variable @xmath48 we find @xmath49    it is interesting to note that the expected background in the source region is @xmath50=\\rho(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] with the most probable value @xmath51 being the mode of @xmath47 when @xmath52 ( if @xmath23 the prior peaks at zero ) .",
    "the commonly used maximum likelihood estimator @xmath53 @xcite is just in between the peak value and the expected background .",
    "the background variance @xmath54=\\rho^2(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] is also very similar ( but not identical ) to the commonly used value of @xmath55 .",
    "the next step is to write down the prior for the source strength @xmath8 .",
    "we assume no prior knowledge here , hence adopt the reference prior calculated in dc2012 .",
    "the starting point for determining @xmath56 is the marginal model @xmath57 which is in our case @xmath58 the polynomial @xmath59 is a function of the real variable @xmath60 with integer parameter @xmath61 and real parameters @xmath62 whose properties are studied in dc2012 .    from the marginal model",

    "hence it is defined apart from a multiplicative constant .",
    "making use of this degree of freedom , the expression proposed by dc2012 is @xmath65 which is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8 with maximum at one for @xmath19 . in the limit of perfect prior background knowledge in the limit @xmath66 while keeping @xmath67 constant . ]",
    "@xmath68 , one gets jeffreys prior for the offset - ed variable @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 $ ] is a known value .    as it is shown in appendix  [ sec - approx ] , the limiting prior @xmath72 can often be used in place of the more complicate reference prior @xmath56 given in ( [ eq - ref - prior - source ] ) .",
    "when this is not the case , a closed - form function provides an excellent approximation of the reference prior @xmath56 as described by @xcite .",
    "this considerably simplifies the computation , although it is not used in this paper .",
    "the marginal reference posterior for the source strength in the source region is finally @xmath73 obtained after having removed the inessential constant factor @xmath74 in front of the marginal model  ( [ eq - marginal - model ] ) , as the normalization of the marginal posterior is found by dividing by the integral from zero to infinity of the expression above ( which is integrable for all possible values of the background shape and rate parameters ) .",
    "the marginal reference posterior ( [ eq - marg - post ] ) is the full solution of our inference problem .",
    "very often , it will be summarized by providing only few figures of merit , like the most probable value or the posterior expectation , plus an interval enclosing the true value with some predefined posterior probability .",
    "to complement this solution , one can check whether the counts @xmath7 in the source region are compatible with the background - only hypothesis by comparing @xmath7 with the expectation @xmath50=\\rho(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] from a simple poisson process in which no source is present .",
    "the statistical significance @xmath75 quantifies the deviation between observed counts and expected background in terms of the displacement from the peak of a normal distribution in units of standard deviations .",
    "an excess of counts for which @xmath76 is commonly called `` a 3-sigma excess '' and considered a real effect ( that is an evidence for an additional contribution on top of the events expected from the background - only hypothesis ) , although more stringent requirements may be preferred , like the `` 5-sigma '' excess traditionally required in high - energy physics to claim the discovery of a new particle , and required by mk2014 too . or @xmath77 leads to the rejection of @xmath18 with a very low probabiliy of false rejection . it does not automatically imply that @xmath20 is true , as there could be more alternative hypotheses in competition , like e.g.  an instrumental effect .",
    "however in the simplified setup in which there are only two alternatives , the excess is usually taken as evidence for the source without further discussion .",
    "we follow this tradition here . ]",
    "a deviation from the expected background can occur in two directions : as an excess of counts when @xmath78=\\rho(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] , or as a deficit when @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the commonly used expression for the significance is eq .",
    "( 17 ) of @xcite ( lm1983 hereafter ) .",
    "such formula gives always a positive value for @xmath75 , while it is more appealing to differentiate between excess and deficit of observed events with respect to the expected background .",
    "in addition , strictly speaking that formula is valid only asymptotically , although it was shown to behave well already with moderately small values of @xmath7 .",
    "we compute the significance of the deviation from @xmath50 $ ] with the inclusion of the uncertainty on the background in the source region , represented by the square root of the prior background variance @xmath54 $ ] , as described by @xcite ( cc2012 in the following ) a poisson process with uncertain parameter , whose probability density is represented by a gamma distribution , is described by the poisson - gamma mixture @xmath80 in our case , we find @xmath81 with the method of moments , from @xmath50 =   c / d = \\rho(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] and @xmath54 = c / d^2 =   \\rho^2(k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$ ] . as expected , the result is @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the same as in eq .",

    "can also be used when there are other ( e.g.  systematic ) contributions to the background uncertainty in the target region , by applying the method of moments with the corresponding ( larger ) variance .",
    "for an excess , the probability @xmath84 to get a deviation not smaller than the observed one is given by the sum from @xmath7 to infinity of ( [ eq - poisson - gamma ] ) .",
    "for a deficit , @xmath84 is given by the sum of the terms from 0 to @xmath7 .",
    "next , we compute the significance @xmath75 by imposing that the integral from @xmath75 to infinity ( excess ) or from minus infinity to @xmath75 ( deficit ) of a standard normal distribution is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "this definition of @xmath84-value ( hence of statistical significance @xmath75 ) is similar to the usual ( frequentist ) definition , with the exception that the poisson - gamma mixture ( the marginal model given @xmath18 ) is used in place of the poisson distribution , to which it reduces in case of negligible background uncertainty .",
    "hence it represents a sort of hybrid computation of the probability that the data deviate from the expectation at least as much as in the actual observation .",
    "the result is valid for any value of @xmath7 , even when @xmath24 , hence it does not rely on asymptotic properties like the lm1983 significance . on the other hand",

    "the model @xmath18 will give values of @xmath75 which are normally distributed with center at zero and unit standard deviation .        a plot produced with all grbs listed in table  [ tab - grb ] apart from grb 080825c is shown in figure  [ fig - significance ] .",
    "the values computed according to lm1983 are also shown for comparison . as mentioned above , they are always positive , which makes a difference when a deficit of events is observed . however , this case is less interesting than the observation of an excess of counts , for which the agreement is acceptable .",
    "the formula by lm1983 overestimates the significance when the latter is small ( by 15% when @xmath99 , increasing when @xmath100 but decreasing when @xmath75 increases ) , which is not a big problem in practice .",
    "when the significance is high , it gives very similar results to our approach .",
    "for example , the detection of grb 080825c by fermi - lat has significance @xmath95 .",
    "also shows than one finds @xmath101 when ignoring the background uncertainty . ]",
    "the formula by lm1983 gives a value of 6.36 while mk2014 obtains 6.11 , hence the three methods agree that the result is very significant .",
    "the good agreement ( 1.6% ) between the standard formula of lm1983 and our method is connected to their very similar background uncertainty estimates ( @xmath102 for the standard method of lm1983 and @xmath103 in our case ) .",
    "however this uncertainty is purely statistical : if any additional contribution exists , then the formula by lm1983 is not able to account for it and the method by cc2012 should be used instead , as it is more general ( the uncertainty is not assumed but is an input parameter ) . another possibility is to compute the posterior probability of @xmath18 given the data , and map it onto a gaussian metric .",
    "this is what is done by mk2014 , whose result is a bit ( 2.4% ) smaller than , but still appreciably similar to ours , despite from the different meaning .    by collecting all significance",
    "values one creates the `` pull distribution '' , which in case of purely stochastic fluctuations should follow a standard normal distribution ( as it is indeed the case when simulating a large number of pseudo - experiments ) .",
    "the inset at the top - left corner of figure  [ fig - significance ] shows that the grb measurements  with the exception of grb 080825c , detected with more than six - sigma statistical significance and not shown there  do not show any strong deviation from that distribution ( dashed black curve ) , which would suggest that @xmath18 does not all for the entire sample .",
    "although a gaussian fit ( red curve ) actually confirms the preference for positive fluctuations which is visible in the bottom plot , it also says that the results are more tightly clustered than expected .",
    "the shift of the barycenter is not significant , being about twice as big as the uncertainty on its position , confirming that the null hypothesis of pure background counts well describes the set of observations .",
    "we have illustrated how the objective bayesian solution to the inference problem for the @xmath104 model can be applied to the on / off problem .",
    "our solution is the marginal reference posterior probability density for the source strength @xmath8 , given the measured counts @xmath7 in the source region , and the auxiliary measurement of background - only counts summarized by the off - source counts @xmath10 and the ratio @xmath14 between the background fluxes in the two regions .",
    "based on the reference prior computed by dc2012 , this solution appears to be more conservative ( higher upper bounds ) when there is no clear detection of additional photons with respect to the background - only expectation in the source region , compared to the posterior proposed recently by mk2014 and to the frequentist method based on asymptotic properties of the profile likelihood test statistic by @xcite .",
    "the approach by mk2014 also aims at providing an objective bayesian result .",
    "its most delicate point is the choice of the prior for the source region",
    ". the choice of jeffreys prior in the @xmath16 space may give troubles which can be avoided if one consider the marginal model instead ( obtained by integrating over the entire range of @xmath9 , weighted by its prior ) .",
    "on the other hand , the marginal model is 1-dimensional and the corresponding reference prior is known .",
    "reference priors , when available , are the recommended objective priors in the statistics literature , as they possess a number of desirable properties and are well `` calibrated '' from the frequentist point of view . in 1-dimensional problems , they usually coincide with jeffreys priors , but this is not true in multidimensional problems .",
    "another possible source of troubles is the hypothesis testing step in the method proposed by mk2014 , as the improper priors used both in the off - source and source regions are not identical .",
    "mk2014 proposes an ad - hoc procedure to overcome the problem , which is based on the questionable assumption that measuring @xmath23 and @xmath24 does not change our degree of belief about the two alternative hypotheses .",
    "we propose to avoid the problem by omitting the comparison between @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "one can compute the statistical significance of the deviation between the observed counts and the background - only expectation on the basis of @xmath18 alone , as a conservative check that the probability of claiming a false detection is low enough .",
    "this complements the estimate of the source strength @xmath8 provided by the marginal reference posterior .    in case",
    "the hypothesis test is considered a fundamental step ( which seems not to be the case here ) , it might be worth noticing that @xcite recommends to base our decision on the comparison between the reference posteriors of each model by means of an invariant information - based loss function ( the `` intrinsic discrepancy '' ) .",
    "this promises to be the best way of achieving an universally applicable procedure which guarantees objective decisions .",
    "unfortunately , this approach to the bayesian hypothesis testing is not yet widespread in the scientific community , where most people continue to look at the bayes factors ( ill - defined in our case ; see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the hpd intervals chosen by mk2014 cover 99% posterior probability .",
    "in other words , they are the shortest 99% credible intervals on the source strength @xmath8 , given the measurements in the on / off regions .",
    "even though they are not invariant under reparametrization , nor it is the most probable value , there is little or no discussion in the astrophysics community about the best choice for the parameter of interest : everybody just looks at @xmath8 .",
    "hence here we also show the posterior mode with 99% credible hpd intervals , although one might consider more complicate ways of summarizing the result in an invariant way .",
    "the interested reader can find details about the `` reference posterior intrinsic loss '' function which allows one to find the `` intrinsic estimator '' of the parameter of interest , together with `` intrinsic 99% credible regions '' for @xmath8 , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical comparison with the results obtained by mk2014 shows that the two methods are in decent agreement , although the use of jeffreys prior leads to narrower posterior densities than the marginal reference posterior .",
    "this means that the upper bounds obtained by mk2014 are always tighter than those obtained here .",
    "the only clear case of unambiguous grb detection by is 080825c by fermi - lat @xcite . for this grb , mk2014 obtains @xmath105 whereas the result obtained here is @xmath106 : even though the posterior peak is at the same position as in mk2014 , our result is slightly more suggestive of a higher intensity , although it well overlaps with mk2014 within the uncertainties .    with all grb data considered here ,",
    "the very simple approximate reference prior @xmath107)^{-1/2}$ ] provides practically the same result as the ( more complicate ) reference prior .",
    "this is always true when the rate parameter describing the gamma prior for @xmath9 is large enough ( in practice , it is sufficient to be larger than a few units ) , or when the shape parameter is large . in our case , the shape parameter of the background prior in the source region is @xmath108 , while the rate parameter is @xmath109 .",
    "the approximate reference prior @xmath72 differs less than 1% from the reference prior when @xmath110 _ or _ @xmath111 , plus a portion of the parameters space which does not satisfy any of these requirements ( appendix  [ sec - approx ] ) .",
    "the first condition is fulfilled by all grbs in table  [ tab - grb ] , apart from grbs 080310 ( @xmath112 ) , 081024a ( @xmath113 ) , and 090515 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "however these three grbs have shape and rate parameters which fall in regions of the parameters space in which @xmath72 differs very little from the reference prior .",
    "this means that the approximate marginal reference posterior @xmath115 \\,|\\ , n + \\tfrac{1}{2 } , 1)\\ ] ] @xcite could have been used in place of the marginal reference posterior ( [ eq - marg - post ] ) , with a considerable simplification .",
    "finally , we have noticed that the significance @xmath75 obtained with the standard asymptotic formula by @xcite , when it is not too small , well agrees with the values calculated as suggested by cc2012 , which are correct for any value of @xmath7 ( including the case @xmath24 ) . by treating the background uncertainty as a free parameter ,",
    "the more recent definition of @xmath75 is more general than the standard formula and should be used whenever additional sources of uncertainty exist beyond the pure statistical fluctuations connected with the finite number of photons collected while pointing off - source .",
    "the bayesian approach proposed by mk2014 aims at providing an objective solution for the on / off measurement .",
    "two possible sources of troubles with this approach are connected with the use of jeffreys prior in the bidimensional space @xmath16 of source and background intensities in the target region , and with the hypothesis test performed with improper priors .    instead of using the jeffreys prior , a different approach exists which provides an objective bayesian solution as the marginal reference posterior for @xmath8 obtained after reducing the problem to a 1-dimensional problem .",
    "this is done by integrating over the background intensity @xmath9 in the target region , for which an informative prior exists .",
    "the reference prior for this 1-dimensional problem is known , which ensures that the solution possesses all the important features of the reference posteriors , including invariance under reparametrization and good frequentist properties .",
    "thus , it is recommended to compute the reference posterior , possibly with the help of some approximation of the reference prior when the difference is small enough ( which can be judged by checking the background parameters as explained in appendix  [ sec - approx ] ) .    a formal two - steps procedure , in which the comparison between background - only @xmath18 and source+background @xmath20 hypotheses is performed before estimating the source intensity in the target region , is not strictly necessary .",
    "a simpler approach is to estimate @xmath8 directly , and only check the significance of the deviation from the expectation from pure background counts in case the posterior for @xmath8 suggests a non negligible source intensity .",
    "as the significance is computed with @xmath18 , one avoids the complications arising when comparing two nested hypotheses whose parameters have improper priors .",
    "the significance @xmath85 defined by mk2014 is bayesian , in the sense that it corresponds to the probability that @xmath18 is true given the data .",
    "thus , it is conceptually different from the usual definition of statistical significance @xmath75 , in terms of the probability of obtaining data with deviations at least as large as the observed one , given @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is a frequentist concept , which is typically computed with the help of asymptotic formulae as in lm1983 .",
    "here we have adopted a hybrid approach which computes the probability of deviations given @xmath18 with the marginal model obtained after integrating over the background in the target region , given by a poisson - gamma mixture .",
    "this approach is superior to lm1983 for three reasons : it does not rely on asymptotics , it differentiates between excess and deficit , and it allows to include any uncertainty on the background ( while lm1983 only account for the statistical uncertainty from the auxiliary measurement ) . as expected , when the significance is high enough , the three definitions provide results which are numerically very similar .",
    "however , our approach behaves differently for mildly significant results , for which lm1983 tend to overestimate @xmath75 , and for all other cases ( including deficits , which get assigned positive @xmath75 values by lm1983 ) .",
    "@xcite emphasize the important difference between the _ upper bound _ on the source intensity @xmath8 in the target region , given the observed number @xmath7 of counts and the prior knowledge about the background intensity @xmath9 in the same region , and the _ upper limit _ on the detectable sources with the chosen detection technique .",
    "upper bounds ( typically at 90% , 95% or 99% confidence level ) are a way of summarizing the result of a measurement , when there is no significant evidence of an excess with respect to the counts expected from the background alone . on the other hand ,",
    "upper limits are connected to the detection technique and can / should be computed before looking at the experimental outcome . in other words ,",
    "upper limits are connected to the _ sensitivity _ of the chosen technique , and do not depend on the counts @xmath7 in the source region .",
    "however , they depend on the estimated background in the target region , which in our case means that they depend on the counts @xmath10 in the off - source region , on the prior knowledge about the background rate @xmath15 in this control region , and on the known ratio @xmath28 between the background rates in both regions . in this paper",
    "we only addressed upper bounds on the measured source intensity . here",
    "we provide an algorithm to compute the upper limit accordingly to @xcite , whose approach is generally valid for any detection technique , for the case of on / off measurements .",
    "the notation by @xcite is the following .",
    "the source and background rates in the target region are @xmath116 , respectively , with corresponding exposure times @xmath117 .",
    "the ratio between the two regions is @xmath118 , and one performs two measurements whose results are the counts @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the source and off - source regions , with @xmath121 the correspondence to our notation is the following : @xmath122    in addition to ( i ) the background prior @xmath47 in the source region , an upper limit also depends on ( ii ) the `` size of the test '' @xmath29 , that is the predefined maximum tolerable probability of false detection ( or type i error rate ) , and on ( iii ) the predefined minimum `` power of the test '' @xmath123 , which is connected with type ii errors ( @xmath124 type ii error rate ) , happening when one makes a false exclusion ( i.e.  does not recognize that a source is present in the target region ) .",
    "common values for @xmath29 are 0.05 , 0.003 ( a `` three - sigma '' threshold ) , and 0.001 , whereas a `` five - sigma '' threshold would correspond to @xmath125 .",
    "in addition , typically one sets @xmath126 or @xmath127 to require at least 50% or 90% detection probability , when speaking about the expected sensitivity of the measurement process for a given source strength .    for the on / off measurement",
    "we choose @xmath7 as the test statistic and fix a threshold @xmath128 such that if @xmath129 we claim that a source has been detected , and if @xmath130 we declare that the measurement is compatible with the background - only hypothesis .",
    "the threshold @xmath131 is chosen such that the probability of false detection ( i.e.  of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis @xmath18 ) does not exceed @xmath29 : @xmath132 where we used the poisson - gamma mixture from eq .",
    "( [ eq - poisson - gamma ] ) with @xmath82 and @xmath133 , i.e.  we used the background prior @xmath47 from eq .",
    "( [ eq - on - bkg - prior ] ) . because the threshold @xmath131 changes at discrete steps , the actual type i error rate will typically be smaller than @xmath29 .    the expected detection probability when @xmath21 is @xmath134 obtained after inserting the polynomial ( [ eq - f ] ) into the marginal model ( [ eq - marginal - model ] ) . for @xmath135",
    "( [ eq - detection ] ) gives the last expression of ( [ eq - threshold ] ) , because only the term with @xmath136 survives in the second sum .",
    "thus @xmath137 , which means that one must find a compromise , while aiming at a low probability of claiming a fake source and a high probability to detect a true but faint source .",
    "now that all ingredients are available , we can formulate the algorithm for computing the upper limit . once the size and power of the test have been chosen ( say @xmath138 and @xmath126 )",
    ", one has to estimate the background in the target region , where the prior @xmath47 shall be chosen as a gamma density whose parameters are determined by the method of moments , starting from the background expectation and variance . in the on / off measurement , we use the control region to find the background in the target region , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - on - bkg - prior ] ) .",
    "next , we define a threshold for detecting the source , in terms of the minimum number @xmath131 of counts which ensures that our type i error rate does not exceed @xmath29 , following the inequality ( [ eq - threshold ] ) . finally , one takes as the upper limit the smallest value of @xmath8 for which @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is computed in eq .  (",
    "[ eq - detection ] ) .",
    "here we report useful approximations to the reference prior @xmath56 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq - ref - prior - source ] ) , from @xcite .",
    "a movie comparing the reference prior with these approximations and with the flat prior is available on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqunrrwinhc , clearly showing when different approximations should be used .    the limiting form @xmath72 of the reference prior when there is certain knowledge of the background in the source region is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - lim - ref - prior ] ) .",
    "the limit of perfect knowledge is approached by increasing values of the shape parameter , as the relative uncertainty on the background in the source region is @xmath141}/e[b ] = 1 / \\sqrt{s}$ ] .",
    "however , it turns out that even at small values of @xmath92 there are cases in which @xmath72 provides a very good approximation to @xmath56 .    in order to quantify the deviation from @xmath56 ,",
    "their relative rms difference has been computed on the signal range @xmath142 , by dividing the distance @xmath143 ^ 2 { \\ensuremath{\\,\\text{d}}}s \\right)^{\\!1/2}\\ ] ] by the integral of the reference prior over the same range .    for most practical purposes , a relative rms difference below",
    "1% is acceptable , as this is the order of magnitude of the maximum change in the posterior in the limit of very few or zero observed counts . for increasing @xmath7 , the changes of the posterior become smaller and smaller .",
    "figure  [ fig - f0 ] shows that the @xmath72 is satisfactory ( differing from @xmath56 by less than 1% ) when the shape parameter is larger than 40 _ or _ the rate parameter is larger than 4 , and in some case even for lower values .",
    "it should be emphasized that the threshold at 1% chosen here is arbitrary and quite conservative . in most applications",
    "larger deviations can be acceptable , as the posteriors will quickly become indistinguishable for increasing number @xmath7 of observed counts .",
    "in addition , the common practice is to summarize the posterior by providing one value ( e.g.  the expectation or the mode ) and some estimate of its uncertainty ( e.g.  the shortest interval covering 68.3% posterior probability ) , by rounding the values to the minimum meaningful number of digits .",
    "often , this summary is quite robust compared to relative rms differences of several percent .",
