    "the handling of small liquid droplets in contact with a gas phase on top of a solid substrate , or of liquid lenses at the interface of two other fluid phases plays an important role in the context of microfluidics ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "a proper thermodynamic description requires to account for not only the bulk and surface properties but also for the special properties of matter in the vicinity of three - phase contact . in order to capture the contribution of the three - phase - contact region to the relevant thermodynamic potential , a certain excess contribution to the appropriate free energy that scales with the linear extension of the system",
    "is associated with the three - phase - contact line , defined by a common intersection of the interfaces meeting in the region of three - phase contact .",

    "we consider the following set - up .",
    "a drop of the non - wetting @xmath1 phase is placed at the interface between two other fluids . a microscopically thin equilibrium wetting film of @xmath1 phase is formed at the interface and for suitably chosen substances and conditions a surplus of @xmath1 phase forms a lens at the @xmath0@xmath2 interface .",
    "( in principle the exploration of the configuration space allows for shifting the lens laterally along the interface ; however , for the purposes of the present paper one may disregard this degree of freedom . ) for such a system two basic scenarios are possible .",
    "the lens ( @xmath1 phase ) can exchange matter with the surrounding phases , so that the chemical potentials in all phases are equal .",
    "there are cases in which the lens is in a stable equilibrium with the surrounding phases ; in other cases the lens is unstable but could be stabilized by imposing suitable constraints .",
    "alternativly , one may consider a nonvolatile liquid ( @xmath1 phase ) , i.e. , one constrains the volume of the liquid while chemical equilibrium is not attained .",
    "+ in addition to the concept of interfaces separating the bulk phases and of interfacial or surface tensions , the systematic thermodynamic description of such systems leads to considering the contact line @xmath3 along which the three interfaces meet .",

    "a different typ of an inhomogeneous fluid system is a sessile drop on a solid substrate . in this case",
    "only two thermodynamic phases coexist whereas the substrate acts as an inert spectator phase . in such cases",
    "the three - phase - contact line corresponds to the region where the interface between two coexisting thermodynamic phases meets the substrate @xcite . in the literature the term line energy or line elasticity",
    "is also frequently used in connection with an extra surface energy associated with the deformation of the three - phase - contact line as the result , e.g. , of interactions with surface defects ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "the notion of line tension is also used to describe the one - dimensional interface of two coexisting , intrinsically two - dimensional phases such as liquid- and vapor - like phases in langmuir  blodget films .",
    "this , however , corresponds to the lower - dimensional version of an interfacial tension and not to the coexistence of three phases as considered here . + there is a growing body of literature describing both experimental and theoretical investigations of the line tension and already a number of reviews",
    "have been published on that subject @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations were carried out for drops on solid substrates @xcite , for liquid lenses at the interface of two fluids @xcite , and for spherical particles or bubbles at the interface of two fluids @xcite ; also the role of line tension in epitaxial growth has been discussed @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "the theory of capillarity has been extended in a phenomenological way by taking into account line contributions and the consequences of these extensions have been explored @xcite .",
    "furthermore there are microscopic calculations of the line tension @xcite and many studies , in most cases based on microscopic theories as well , concentrate on the behavior of the line tension in the vicinity of a wetting transition @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies are also devoted to the examination of the influence of the droplet size on the line tension @xcite and of the electrostatic contributions to the line tension which arise in the presence of surface charges @xcite .",
    "the boundary tension between two coexisting wetting films of different thicknesses was studied as well ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a drop - size dependence of the contact angle was studied in molecular dynamics simulations without deducing values for the line tension ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "finally , the line tension was studied also via molecular dynamics simulations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) or via an analysis of probability distributions as obtained from monte carlo simulations at three - phase contact @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection of these results reveals that certain aspects of the line tension either give rise to conflicting statements or remain unaddressed , leading us to set out to clarify the following basic questions :    *   in which sense is the concept of the line tension well defined ?",
    "*   is it sufficient for the determination of equilibrium shapes to characterize the thermodynamics of the contact line by a line tension only ?",
    "these questions arise because it is not obvious that the definition of @xmath4 via eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) leads to a unique result .",
    "the reason lies in the arbitrariness in the definition of the position of the interfaces between adjacent phases .",
    "this arbitrariness is due to the smooth spatial transition between the adjacent phases .",
    "once the density distributions of the fluid components across the interfacial region are known , for example on the basis of scattering experiments or atomic force microscopy @xcite , or theoretically by simulations or density - functional calculations , a criterion has to be applied which fixes the interface position somewhere in the transition region .",
    "however , there exists a multitude of sensible choices .",
    "the arbitrariness in the definition of the interface positions leads to an arbitrariness in the definitions of the volumes , areas , lengths , and to some extent even interfacial tensions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "although it was shown by widom @xcite that @xmath4 is independent of the particular choice of the dividing interfaces in the case of a straight three - phase - contact line in a system with three thermodynamically coexisting fluid phases separated by planar interfaces , it is not clear that the same will be true in other cases as well , e.g. , if two fluid phases are in contact with an inert solid phase , or for systems in which the curvatures of the interfaces and of the contact line plays a role . a first discussion , which naturally raises the issues , concerning the uniqueness of the line tension for the case in which two fluid phases are in contact with and meet at an inert solid phase , is given in sect .",
    "this discussion , however , turns out to be incomplete and it leads to a contradiction with one of the results obtained in sect . 5 , which states that the line tension _ as defined there _ is unique . a thorough discussion and the resolution of the contradiction is given in sect .",
    "6 . in sect .",
    "5 we mainly investigate the three - phase - contact line in systems with curved interfaces . on the other hand , just these systems",
    "are studied experimentally if one attempts to determine the value of the line tension , e.g. , via measuring the dependence of the contact angle on droplet size ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the curvature dependence of interfacial tensions leads to contributions to the free energy which scale with the linear extension of the system , i.e. , very much like the line contribution . since in many cases interface curvature and the length of the three - phase - contact line",
    "can not be varied independently , these two contributions are not distinguishable per se .",
    "thus , line tension and curvature effects on the interfacial tensions have to be discussed simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the curvature expansion of the surface tension has to be known in advance before the line tension may be determined from eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) .",
    "+ since in the present context it is unavoidable to consider curvature effects on the interfacial tensions and because it is known that a consistent description of curved ( spherical ) interfaces must take into account  for general dividing interfaces  derivatives of the surface tensions with respect to their radii of curvature , i.e. , their bending rigidities ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we expect that a complete thermodynamic description of three - phase - contact lines requires the introduction of further material parameters in addition to the line tension .",
    "indeed , a number of theoretical analyses have appeared in the literature in which additional material parameters were introduced in order to characterize the three - phase - contact line @xcite .",
    "recent studies have been carried out by rusanov et al .",
    "@xcite for a drop on a solid substrate , and by widom and coworkers in connection with the line analogue of the gibbs adsorption equation @xcite for a straight contact line at a genuine three - phase contact . in sect .",
    "5 we systematically study these issues guided by the concept of form - invariance of the basic equations under so - called notional shifts of dividing interfaces ( for a definition see , c.f . , sects . 2 and 5 ) .",
    "as a prerequisite to a thorough study of these issues we also have to answer similar questions related to the concept of surface tensions .",
    "however , before discussing them and in particular the main questions concerning the line tension , we point at related issues recurring in the literature which can be judged only after the basic questions raised above have found a satisfactory answer .",
    "these issues are :    * what is the typical magnitude of the line tension ?",
    "+ of course , the line tension depends on the thermodynamic state of the system and the number of relevant thermodynamic degrees of freedom varies from system to system .",
    "for example , for certain systems the temperature dependence of the line tension becomes especially pronounced close to wetting transitions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for many systems away from such special thermodynamic states there is now widespread agreement that the value of the line tension is of the order of @xmath16 n @xcite . with the experimental accuracy available at present the corresponding prefactor distinguishes between different systems . *",
    "what is the sign of the line tension ?",
    "+ various experimental and theoretical investigations lead to values of the line tension which include both signs @xcite .",
    "since - contrary to the interfacial tension - there exists no thermodynamic argument for a specific sign of the line tension @xcite , so that experimental findings for the line tension with a certain sign can not be discarded from the outset .",
    "( even in this respect a contrary statement may be found in the literature @xcite . ) on the other hand , if one is interested in the temperature dependence of the line tension for a specific system which undergoes a first - order wetting transition , both theoretical and experimental results show that upon increasing the temperature towards the wetting transition temperature the line tension changes sign from negative to positive values @xcite .",
    "* is a negative line tension compatible with the structural stability of drops ? + the mesoscopic analysis of line tensions including small wavelength fluctuations confirms that negative values of the line tension do not lead to instabilities @xcite .",
    "* what does the line tension depend on ?",
    "+ similarly to the interfacial tension it is a function of the thermodynamic state of the system . for straight contact lines , defined by intersecting planar interfaces",
    ", the phases involved must be at stable thermodynamic coexistence .",
    "for example , one - component fluids in contact with an inert substrate must be at liquid ",
    "vapor coexistence @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the chemical potential .",
    "thus in this case the line tension is a function of temperature only .",
    "if the fluid in contact with a substrate consists of a binary mixture of a and b particles , the fluid must be at fluid ",
    "fluid coexistence , i.e. , @xmath19 which leaves two thermodynamic variables free . for three - phase contact among three fluid phases",
    "the system must be at the triple line ( @xmath20 ) of a - rich liquid , b - rich liquid , and vapor coexistence so that in this case the line tension is again a function of temperature only .",
    "this dependence can be reparametrized in terms of the temperature dependent contact angle @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for curved contact lines defined by intersecting curved interfaces .",
    "droplets of finite size residing on a substrate or liquid lenses formed at planar fluid  fluid interfaces are examples in which the contact lines are curved . due to",
    "their curvature droplets or lenses remain in a ( constrained ) equilibrium with their surrounding phases , which takes place at chemical potentials slightly off their values @xmath22 at stable thermodynamic coexistence with planar interfaces . under these conditions",
    "the pressure is different inside and outside the droplet or lens .",
    "this pressure difference and at the same time the size of the droplet or lens are prescribed by the chosen chemical potentials or alternatively by the temperature and the ambient pressure which deviates from that for stable coexistence at the same temperature .",
    "thus in principle the line tension may now depend on a further thermodynamic variable in addition to @xmath23 .",
    "this dependence can be reparametrized in terms of the size of the droplet or lense .",
    "+ in addition , from the theoretical point of view the line tension @xmath4 is a functional of both the interaction potentials between the fluid particles and the substrate potential .",
    "if the microscopic forces are too long - ranged @xmath4 becomes ill defined while the corresponding interfacial and surface tensions retain their validity @xcite , i.e. , in this case the size dependence of @xmath5 can not be described in terms of a bulk , surface , and line contribution with a line tension which is size- and shape - independent in the thermodynamic limit . +",
    "it appears that in extracting line tensions from experimental data so far the curvature dependence of the interfacial tension , characterized by the tolman length @xcite , has been completely neglected .",
    "therefore the question arises to which extent the experimental determination of the line tension is affected by the tolman length . *",
    "can one measure the line tension ?",
    "+ in the last chapter we shall point at possible difficulties to determine line tensions uniquely .",
    "in the following we discuss a possible source of ambiguity in the definition of the line tension ( see eq . ) in the case that one of the phases considered in sec . 1 is an inert substrate , i.e. , we consider two - phase coexistence in the presence of an inert wall rather than coexistence of three genuine thermodynamic phases .",
    "we focus on the issue of non - uniqueness of the liquid  substrate or gas  substrate interfacial tensions . to this end",
    "we first briefly mention the related question of the thermodynamic determination of the interfacial tension @xmath14 in a system in which two coexisting _ fluid phases _ , say @xmath9 and @xmath13 , meet along a planar interface @xcite . using the formula",
    "@xmath24 the question appears whether the corresponding value of the interfacial tension depends on the arbitrary choice of the position of the fluid ",
    "fluid interface and the corresponding volumes @xmath11 and @xmath25 . in the case of a planar interface the value of the interfacial tension",
    "does not depend on the position of the interface , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) leads to a unique result .",
    "the reason is that the total volume @xmath26 as well as the surface area @xmath27 are independent of the location of the dividing surface ; in addition due to thermal equilibrium one has @xmath28 .",
    "( for a complete discussion of this issue see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . ) + however , in situations in which one of the phases , say phase @xmath2 , is an inert substrate with a planar surface , a difference to the case of fluid  fluid interfaces arises because the inert substrate is not one of the thermodynamically coexisting phases .",
    "although it is not a priori obvious whether one should treat the substrate as a part of the system or not , it is usually considered as an external object which just provides a steep external potential defining the boundaries of the system .",
    "+ it might appear that the freedom in positioning the dividing interface is less obvious for the solid  fluid interface than for the fluid ",
    "fluid interface because a solid surface is defined rather sharply , say by the positions of the nuclei of the atoms forming the topmost layer .",
    "however , even then the position at which an actual experimental technique ( e.g. , atomic force microscopy , optical methods , etc . ) will locate the surface of the solid will certainly deviate from the definition given above , because of the smooth decay of the substrate potential and of the finite extension of the electron cloud of the substrate , and because the fluid phase in contact with the solid only gradually attains its bulk properties . depending on the kind of experiment and on the way the data are analyzed , relative shifts in the location of the dividing surface which are of the order of one or even several atomic radii are conceivable . this shift multiplied by the surface tension under consideration",
    "yields a force which is comparable with the magnitude of the line tension .",
    "moreover , a solid substrate in contact with a vapor phase might be covered with a thin liquid - like wetting film which is in thermal equilibrium with the bulk vapor phase . in a thermodynamic description in terms of interfacial and line tensions",
    "as considered here , this thin wetting film is not treated as a separate entity but as part of the solid  vapor interface and as such it contributes to the actual solid  vapor ( _ g_as ) surface tension @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly the question arises , where to place the solid  vapor interface",
    ". it could be somewhere in the transition region from the liquid - like film to the vapor or at the transition region from the solid to the liquid - like film .",
    "it is very likely that different experimental techniques imply different conventions .",
    "( if nonequilibrium situations are considered @xmath29 may be different from its equilibrium value if the aforementioned thin wetting film  present at thermal equilibrium  has not yet formed . )    in order to explore the consequences of the freedom in choosing the dividing surface , we consider a system in which a planar inert substrate is exposed to the fluid @xmath30 , i.e. , the liquid or gas phase ( see fig .",

    "fluid interface is not unique we can consider another position of this interface which is parallel to the first one and located a distance @xmath31 above it ( see fig.1 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , whereas the surface area @xmath39 does not change upon the vertical shift of the interface .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ sf ] ) that the values of the substrate ",
    "fluid surface tensions corresponding to these two choices differ by @xmath43 thus a different choice of the location of the substrate ",
    "fluid interface corresponds to a redistribution of the free energy between the bulk and the surface terms , and to different values of the substrate",
    " fluid surface tension .",
    "note that in the case of _ thermodynamically coexisting _ liquid and gas phases the grand canonical free energy densities of the two phases ( i.e. , the negative pressures ) are equal ( @xmath44 ) and thus the well known conclusion @xmath45 follows ( see refs .",
    "at the same time we emphasize that the difference @xmath46 ( which , e.g. , enters into young s law for the contact angle ( see , c.f . , eq . ( [ young ] ) ) does not depend on this choice of the dividing surface provided the dividing interfaces between solid and gas on one hand and between solid and liquid on the other hand are chosen to be at the same height above the solid , and provided the solid is in the same state in both cases .",
    "in the case of three genuine thermodynamically coexisting phases the issue analogous to the one raised in sect . 2 is whether the value of the line tension @xmath4 determined from eq .",

    "it is expected that the grand potential ( and the decomposition into volume , interfacial , and line contributions ) calculated in that way is equal to what one obtains if one decomposes the grand potential of the whole system into volume , interfacial , and line contributions and then adds up these contributions without first partitioning the system . in what follows",
    "we discuss why it may be sometimes misleading to ignore the unphysical edge terms .",
    "the decomposition introduced above is not unique .",

    "the embedding system ii is not specified in any detail except that it is understood that the structures found within the box , e.g. , the liquid  gas interface , extend beyond the box boundaries into the embedding system ii .",

    "gas interface intersects a face of the box .",
    "the environments of these lines are not different from bulk or from a corresponding region in an infinitely extended interface .",
    "inspite of the absence of actual line contributions , artificial non - physical line contributions at the lines just mentioned have to be included in the expressions for the grand canonical potentials characterizing the subsystems .",
    "that there is a need to introduce these artificial line terms becomes very plausible if one looks at the two possible decompositions of a system into two subsystems shown in fig .",
    "evidently interfaces are cut in different ways by the faces defining subsystem i for the two considered options .",
    "therefore , contributions to the grand canonical potential stemming from certain parts of the interfaces are either attributed to subsystem i or subsystem ii depending on how the decomposition is done .",

    "already this decomposition is problematic and not unique although obvious choices do exist .",
    "for instance , if we base our theoretical description on a type of model in which the grand canonical potential is expressed in terms of a local functional of the number density ( of , e.g. , the ginzburg ",

    "<S> we analyze two representative systems containing a three - phase - contact line : a liquid lens at a fluid  fluid interface and a liquid drop in contact with a gas phase residing on a solid substrate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we study a system containing a planar liquid  gas interface in contact with a solid substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss to which extent the decomposition of the grand canonical free energy of such systems into volume , surface , and line contributions is unique in spite of the freedom one has in positioning the gibbs dividing interfaces . before being able to define the line contribution to the grand canonical free energy per unit length , the so - called line tension , first certain properties have to be attributed to the bulk phases and to the interfaces ; </S>",
    "<S> these are chosen in agreement with what is known for spherical drops and for planar interfaces . in the case of a lens </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the line tension is independent of arbitrary choices of the gibbs dividing interfaces . in the case of a drop </S>",
    "<S> , however , one arrives at two different possible definitions of the line tension . </S>",
    "<S> one of them corresponds seamlessly to that applicable to the lens . </S>",
    "<S> the line tension defined this way turns out to be independent of choices of the gibbs dividing interfaces . in the case of the second definition , </S>",
    "<S> however , the line tension does depend on the choice of the gibbs dividing interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide equations for the equilibrium contact angles which are form - invariant with respect to notional shifts of dividing interfaces which change the description of the system but leave the density configurations unchanged . in order to reconcile the transformation laws for the line tensions under notional changes of dividing interfaces , which follow from the decomposition of the grand canonical free energy , with the principle of form invariance and moreover with the invariance of observables under notional changes , additional stiffness constants attributed to the line </S>",
    "<S> must be introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the dividing interfaces influences the actual values of the stiffness constants . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these constants transform as a function of the relative displacements of the dividing interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation provides a clearly defined scheme to determine line properties from measured dependences of the contact angles on lens or drop volumes . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme implies relations different from the modified neumann or young equations , which currently are the basis for extracting line tensions from experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> these relations show that the experiments do not render the line tension alone but a combination of the line tension , the tolman length , and the stiffness constants of the line . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous approaches our scheme works consistently for any choice of the dividing interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> it further allows us to compare results obtained by different experimental or theoretical methods , based on different conventions of choosing the dividing interfaces . </S>"
