    "the widely - used kohn - sham formulation of density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite requires approximations to the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the simplest approximation to this functional is the so - called local - density approximation ( lda ) , where @xmath0 $ ] is given at each point by the xc energy of a uniform electron gas at the local density .",
    "this approximation was found to be remarkably accurate in some rather inhomogeneous situations , @xcite and its widespread use in condensed - matter physics led to the early success of dft .",
    "hence , it is important that the lda be tested against _",
    "systems , such as the jellium surface , and that new functionals be developed . nevertheless , more than 30 years after lang and kohn reported the first self - consistent lda calculation of the jellium surface energy , @xcite the question of the impact of non - local xc effects on the surface energy and their interplay with the strong charge inhomogeneity at the surface has remained a puzzle .",
    "@xcite the simple lda and more advanced density functionals such as generalized gradient approximations ( gga s ) @xcite and meta - gga s @xcite all predict the same jellium xc surface energy within a few percent , but show no such agreement with the available wave - function based methods : fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) @xcite and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) ; @xcite see table i of ref . .",
    "an alternative formally exact way to find the xc energy of an arbitrary inhomogeneous system is provided by the adiabatic connection formula and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "@xcite within this approach , the exchange energy is fully determined from the exact kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals and the correlation energy is obtained in terms of the xc kernel @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , @xmath1 is taken to be zero .",
    "full rpa or corrected - rpa calculations are now feasible not only for bulk jellium @xcite but also for jellium surfaces @xcite and molecules . @xcite    in this paper , we take a non - local xc kernel that provides accurate ground - state energies of a uniform electron gas , @xcite and evaluate the jellium surface energy through the use of the adiabatic connection formula .",
    "we analyze the correlation surface energy into contributions from dynamic density fluctuations of various two - dimensional wave vectors , and find that short - range xc effects on intermediate and short - wavelength fluctuations nearly compensate . hence , while rpa is known to be a poor approximation for the total correlation energy , our calculations show that it is a surprisingly good approximation for those changes in the correlation energy that arise in surface formation .",
    "this is in contrast with fhnc and dmc slab calculations , @xcite which predict surface energies that are significantly higher than those obtained either in the lda @xcite or in a fully non - local rpa .",
    "@xcite    the fhnc variational equations have been shown to provide , in the homogeneous limit , reasonable agreement with the known properties of a uniform electron gas , @xcite and dmc calculations are often regarded as essentially exact .",
    "@xcite furthermore , one may expect that when applied to non - uniform systems these wave - function - based approaches will lead to results whose accuracy is comparable to the high accuracy obtained for uniform systems . nevertheless , we show that surface formation energies obtained from slab calculations either by a linear fit in the slab thickness @xcite or as differences between slab energies and an independently determined bulk energy @xcite may result in substantial imprecision , and conclude that wave - function - based estimates need to be reconsidered .",
    "we consider a jellium slab normal to the @xmath2 axis , which is translationally invariant in the surface plane . subtracting from the slab energy the corresponding energy of a uniform electron gas and using the adiabatic connection formula ,",
    "one obtains the xc surface energy @xmath3 @xmath4 being a wave vector parallel to the surface .",

    "we have also carried out adiabatic lda ( alda ) surface - energy calculations with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath32 [ thus assuming that the dynamic density fluctuation is slowly varying in all directions ] , and have found that the spacial range of the xc kernel can not be neglected .",

    "( [ corradini ] ) ( corradini - based lda ) , or by using the perdew - wang ( pw ) parametrization of ref . .",
    "we observe that in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath41 ) both rpa and corradini calculations coincide with the pw parametrization . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the corradini scheme predicts a substantial correction to the rpa and accurately reproduces the pw wave - vector analysis of the correlation energy .",
    "hence , armed with some confidence in the accuracy of our choice of the xc kernel , we apply it to the more realistic non - local scheme described above .",
    "1 shows that our non - lda beyond - rpa ( best non - local ) calculation coincides in the @xmath41 limit @xcite with the non - lda rpa , which is exact in this limit . in the large-@xmath7 limit ,",
    "local and non - local calculations coincide , and our best non - local calculation accurately reproduces the pw - based lda ( thin solid line ) , which is expected to be esentially exact in this limit .    consequently , our best non - local calculation provides both the _ exact _",
    "small-@xmath7 limit , where lda fails badly , and the _ exact _ large-@xmath7 limit , where rpa is wrong .",

    "however , short - range xc effects on intermediate and short - wavelength contributions to the surface energy tend to compensate , and this cancellation happens to be even more complete than expected from lda or gga .",

    "we close this paper with an analysis of the available wave - function - based surface - energy calculations .",
    "@xcite considered slabs of four different thickness @xmath58 , and obtained both a bulk energy per particle @xmath59 and a surface energy @xmath51 from the fhnc slab energy per particle @xmath60 as a function of the particle number per unit area @xmath61 , by a linear fit @xmath62 that becomes exact in the limit of infinite thickness .",

    ", since for the smallest / largest width under study and due to oscillatory quantum - size effects the quantity @xmath67 is larger / smaller than expected for a semi - infinite medium , the extrapolated bulk and surface energies are found to be too negative and too large , respectively .",
    "li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the fixed - node dmc surface energy of a jellium slab with @xmath66 and found @xmath68 , which is @xmath69 larger than the rpa value .",
    "they also performed lda calculations with either the wigner or the ceperley - alder form for the uniform - gas xc energy , and found lda surface energies that are also about @xmath70 larger than the corresponding lda surface energies of a semi - infinite jellium , which suggests that finite - size corrections might bring the dmc surface energy into close agreement with rpa .",
    "these fixed - node dmc calculations were extended by acioli and ceperley to study jellium slabs at five different densities , @xcite but these authors extracted the surface energy from release - node bulk energies . both li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and acioli and ceperley @xcite claimed that the release - node correction of the uniform electron gas at @xmath66 is @xmath71 , and argued that this correction would only yield a small error in the surface energy .",
    "however , the unpublished uniform - gas fixed - node energy reported and used in ref .",
    "is actually @xmath72 higher than its release - node counterpart ; hence , by combining fixed - node slab and release - node bulk energies acioli and ceperley produced for @xmath66 a surface energy that is too large by 138 erg/@xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , had these authors used fixed - node bulk energies ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , they would have obtained surface energies that are close to rpa .",
    "we have investigated the role that short - range correlation plays at metal surfaces , on the basis of a wave - vector analysis of the correlation surface energy .",
    "our non - local calculations , which are found to provide the _ exact _ small and large-@xmath7 limits , indicate that a persistent cancellation of short - range correlation effects yields surface energies that are in excellent agreement with rpa , and support the conclusion that the error introduced by the lda is small .",
    "although this conclusion seems to be in contrast with available wave - function based calculations , we have shown that a careful analysis of these data might bring them into close agreement with rpa .",
    "this is consistent with recent work , where jellium surface energies extracted from dmc calculations for jellium spheres are also found to be close to rpa .",
    "we have found that the rpa xc surface energy displays an error cancellation between short- and intermediate - range correlations . a different ( and less complete ) error cancellation between long- and intermediate - range xc effects explains @xcite why the lda works for the surface energy .",
    "the gga corrects only the intermediate - range contributions , @xcite and so gives surface energies slightly lower and less accurate than those of lda .",
    "usually gga works better than lda , but not for the jellium surface energy where long - range effects are especially important . in the present work , as in four others , @xcite we have found that the jellium xc surface energy is only a few percent higher than it is in lda .",
    "these closely - agreeing methods include two different short - range corrections to rpa ( present work using a non - local xc kernel and ref . using an additive gga correction ) , a long - range correction to gga ( ref . ) , extraction of a surface energy from dmc energies for jellium spheres ( ref . ) , and a meta - gga density functional ( ref . ) .",
    "the corresponding correction to the lda or gga surface energy has been transferred @xcite successfully to the prediction of vacancy formation energies @xcite and works of adhesion .",
    "@xcite    we have almost reached a solution of the surface - energy puzzle , but one piece still does not fit . krotscheck and",
    "kohn @xcite examined a `` collective rpa '' which approximates our full rpa , and also used several xc kernels to correct for short - range effects . when they used an isotropic xc kernel derived from the uniform gas , in the spirit of our eq .",
    "( 6 ) , they found surface energies very close to rpa , as we do .",
    "when they used fhnc,@xcite corresponding to an anisotropic ( but to the eye not very different ) kernel constructed explicitly for the jellium surface , they found a large positive correction to the rpa surface energy , amounting at @xmath73 to as much as @xmath74 of the rpa @xmath75 or @xmath76 of the rpa total @xmath51 .",
    "the story of the jellium surface energy can not reach an end until their work is reconciled with the other work on this subject .",
    "the dmc energies of jellium slabs should also be re - considered .",
    "@xcite    measured surface energies of real metals have been compared with calculations in refs . .",
