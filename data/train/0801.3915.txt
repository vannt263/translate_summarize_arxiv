    "since elliptic flow has been seen at rhic  @xcite , it has become a crucial observable for our understanding of the system created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "anisotropic flow is most often analyzed using the event - plane method  @xcite .",
    "these analyses are plagued by systematic errors due to nonflow effects  @xcite .",
    "nonflow effects are particularly large at high @xmath0  @xcite , where they are likely to originate from jet - like ( hard ) correlations ; they are expected to be even larger at the lhc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that nonflow effects can be avoided at the expense of a slight modification of the event - plane method .",
    "anisotropic flow of an outgoing particle of a given type , in a given phase - space window , is defined as its azimuthal correlation with the reaction plane  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an integer ( @xmath3 is _ directed _ flow , @xmath4 is _ elliptic _ flow ) , @xmath5 denotes the azimuth of the particle under study , @xmath6 the azimuth of the reaction plane , and angular brackets denote an average over particles and events . since @xmath6 is not known experimentally , @xmath7 can not be measured directly .",
    "the most commonly used method to estimate @xmath7 is the event - plane method  @xcite . in each event , one constructs an estimate of the reaction plane @xmath6 , the `` event plane '' @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flow coefficients are then estimated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the event - plane resolution , which corrects for the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath6",
    ". this resolution is determined in each centrality class through a standard procedure  @xcite .",
    "the analogy between eq .",
    "( [ v2std ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ defvn ] ) makes the method rather intuitive , but its practical implementation has a few subtleties :    * one must remove autocorrelations : the particle under study should not be used in defining the event plane , otherwise there is a trivial correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this means in practice that one must keep track of which particles have been used in defining the event plane , so as to remove them if necessary .",
    "* nonflow correlations between the particle under study and the event plane must be avoided .",
    "this can not be done in a systematic way , but rapidity gaps are believed to largely suppress nonflow effects  @xcite . *",
    "event - plane flattening procedures must be implemented to correct for azimuthal asymmetries of the detector acceptance  @xcite .",
    "a systematic way of eliminating nonflow effects is to use improved methods such as cumulants  @xcite or lee - yang zeroes  @xcite .",
    "cumulants have been used at sps  @xcite and rhic  @xcite .",
    "lee - yang zeroes have been implemented at sis  @xcite and at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the reason why these methods have not been more widely used is probably that they are thought to be tedious .    in this paper , we show that the method of flow analysis based on lee - yang zeroes can be recast in a form similar to the event - plane method . specifically , eq .  ( [ v2std ] ) is replaced with @xmath11 where @xmath8 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ v2std ] ) , and @xmath12 is a new quantity , the _ event weight _ , which depends on the length of the flow vector .",
    "the advantage of this improved event - plane method over the standard event - plane method is that _ both autocorrelations and nonflow effects _ are automatically removed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : description ] , we describe the method for a detector with perfect azimuthal symmetry , and we explain why it automatically gets rid of autocorrelations and nonflow correlations , in contrast to the standard event - plane method .",
    "readers interested in applying the method should jump to appendix  [ s : implementation ] , which describes the recommended practical implementation , taking into account anisotropies in the detector acceptance . in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] , we present results of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "lee - yang zeroes are compared to 2- and 4-particle cumulants .",
    "[ s : discussion ] concludes with a discussion of where the method should be applicable , and of its limitations .",
    "the first step of the flow analysis is to evaluate , for each event , the flow vector of the event .",
    "it is a two - dimensional vector @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 where the sum runs over all detected particles , @xmath15 is the observed multiplicity of the event , @xmath16 are the azimuthal angles of the particles measured with respect to a fixed direction in the laboratory .",
    "the coefficients @xmath17 in eq .  ( [ flowvector ] )",
    "are weights depending on transverse momentum , particle mass and rapidity .",
    "the best weight , which minimizes the statistical error ( or , equivalently , maximizes the resolution ) is @xmath7 itself , @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable choice for elliptic flow at rhic ( and probably lhc ) is @xmath19 .",
    "lee - yang zeroes use the projection of the flow vector onto a fixed , arbitrary direction making an angle @xmath20 with respect to the @xmath21-axis .",
    "we denote this projection by @xmath22 : @xmath23      the first step of the analysis is to measure the integrated flow @xmath24 , defined as the average value of the projection of @xmath25 onto the true reaction plane : @xmath26 where angular brackets denote an average over events .",
    "we define the complex - valued function : @xmath27 the modulus @xmath28 can be plotted as a function of @xmath29 for positive @xmath29 . in the case where collective flow is present",
    ", this modulus has a sharp minimum , compatible with 0 within statistical errors  @xcite .",
    "this is the lee - yang zero , which is determined by finding the first minimum numerically .",
    "we denote its value by @xmath30 . the estimate of the integrated flow",
    "is then defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the first zero of the spherical bessel function @xmath33 .",
    "please note that the above procedure only makes use of the projection of the flow vector onto an arbitrary direction @xmath34 . for a perfect detector",
    ", azimuthal symmetry ensures that @xmath30 is independent of @xmath34 , up to statistical errors . in practice , however , it is recommended to repeat the analysis for several values of @xmath34 ( see appendix  [ s : implementation ] ) .",
    "once @xmath30 is determined , the event weight is defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spherical bessel function of first order , @xmath37 is the length of the flow vector , and @xmath38 is a normalization constant which is the same for all events in the centrality class .",

    "if @xmath41 is smaller , the distribution of @xmath37 is correspondingly wider , and @xmath12 is negative for some events .",
    "these negative weights are required in order to subtract nonflow effects , as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ s : nonflow ] . on the other hand",

    "( [ defc ] ) .",

    "we consider the situation where there is collective flow in the system , so that @xmath7 is non - zero for most of the particles .",

    "this means that one of the two factors in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the method presented in this paper is an improved event - plane method , which eliminates the first source of uncertainty , nonflow effects .",
    "it has been recently argued  @xcite that cumulants ( and therefore lee - yang zeroes , which corresponds to the limit of large - order cumulants ) also eliminate eccentricity fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "however , a recent detailed study  @xcite shows that even with cumulants , there may remain large effects of fluctuations in central collisions and/or small systems .",
    "this issue deserves more detailed investigations .",
    "letting aside the question of fluctuations , we now discuss which method of flow analysis should be used , depending on the situation .",
    "there are three main classes of methods : the standard event - plane method  @xcite , four - particle cumulants  @xcite , and the lee - yang - zeroes method presented in this paper .",
    "when the standard event - plane method is used , nonflow effects and eccentricity fluctuations are generally the main sources of uncertainty on @xmath7 , and they dominate over statistical errors .",

    "the error is only 35% larger with lee - yang zeroes than with 4-particle cumulants ( and 4 times larger than with the event - plane method ) .",
    "our recommendation is that lee - yang zeroes should be used as soon as @xmath84 . for small values of @xmath41 , typically @xmath85 ,",
    "statistical errors on lee - yang zeroes blow up exponentially , which rules out the method ; the statistical error on 4-particle cumulants also increases but more mildly , and their validity extends down to lower values of the resolution if very large event statistics is available .",
    "a limitation of the present method is that it does not apply to mixed harmonics : this means that it can not be used to measure @xmath3 and @xmath86 at rhic and lhc using the event plane from elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath3 can in principle be measured using lee - yang zeroes  @xcite using the `` product '' generating function , but this method can not be recast in the form of an improved event - plane method .",
    "higher harmonics such as @xmath86 also have a sensitivity to autocorrelations and nonflow effects , which is significantly reduced by using the product generating function  @xcite .",
    "although we have only explained how to analyze the anisotropic flow of individual particles , it is straightforward to extend the method to azimuthally dependent correlations  @xcite .",
    "the only complication is that the azimuthal distribution of particle pairs generally involves _ sine _",
    "terms  @xcite , in addition to the _ cosine _ terms of eq .",
    "( [ defvn ] ) .",
    "these terms are simply obtained by replacing cos with sin in eq .",

    ", we have presented an improved event - plane method for the flow analysis , which automatically corrects for autocorrelations and nonflow effects . as in the standard method",
    ", each event has its _ event plane _ @xmath8 , an estimate of the reaction plane , which is the same as for the standard method , except for technical details in the practical implementation .",
    "the trick which removes autocorrelations and nonflow effects is that there is in addition an _",
    "event weight_. anisotropic flow @xmath7 is then estimated as a _ weighted _ average of @xmath87",
    ". a straightforward application of this method would be to measure jet production with respect to the reaction plane at lhc . with the traditional event - plane method , such a measurement would require to subtract particles belonging to the jet from the event plane ;",
    "in addition , strong nonflow correlations are expected within a jet , which would bias the analysis .",
    "jyo thanks yiota foka for a discussion which motivated this work .",
    "before we describe the implementation of the method , let us mention that there are in fact two lee - yang - zeroes methods , depending on how the generating function is defined : the `` sum generating function '' makes explicit use of the flow vector  @xcite , while the `` product generating function ''  @xcite is constructed using the azimuthal angles of individual particles , and can not be expressed simply in terms of the flow vector .",
    "cumulants also exist in both versions , the `` sum ''  @xcite and the `` product ''  @xcite . for lee - yang zeroes , both the sum and the product",
