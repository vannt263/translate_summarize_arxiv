    "it has recently been shown that ground state conformations of polyampholytes , a particular type of heteropolymers built with a random mixture of positively and negatively charged groups along their backbone , are extremely sensitive to the their total ( excess ) charge @xmath7 . a detailed study of the @xmath7dependence of the radius of gyration @xmath8@xcite determined that a reasonable compromise between stretching ( which minimizes the electrostatic energy ) and remaining compact ( which gains in condensation energy ) is for the polyampholyte to form a _ necklace _ of weakly charged blobs connected with highly charged `` necks '' , by taking advantage of the charge fluctuations along the chain .",
    "the results of monte carlo@xcite and exact enumeration@xcite studies qualitatively support such a picture .",
    "while the exact treatment of electrostatic interactions is not possible , we can pose a simplified problem which , we hope , captures some essential features of this necklace model .",
    "for example , we may ask what the typical size of the largest neutral ( or weakly charged ) segment in a random sequence of @xmath0 charges will be . in order to answer this question",
    ", we investigated the size distribution of the largest neutral segments in polyampholytes with @xmath0 monomers ( @xmath9mers ) .",
    "this problem can be mapped to a one - dimensional random walk ( rw ) : the sequence of charges @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) corresponds to an @xmath0step walk @xmath12 with the same sequence of unit steps in the positive or negative directions along an axis , where the probability of going up or down is equal to @xmath13 at each step .",
    "[ randomwalk ] depicts an example of such a sequence and the corresponding path , where @xmath14 is the position of the path at index @xmath15 .",
    "( @xmath16 . )",
    "a segment of @xmath1 monomers with zero total charge thus corresponds to an @xmath1step loop inside the rw . in this paper , we further investigate properties of the probability @xmath17 that the _ largest _ loop in an @xmath0step rw has length @xmath1 , or , equivalently , the probability @xmath18 that all loops in an @xmath0step rw are shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "earlier results about a generalized version of this and other related problems can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the continuum ( @xmath19 )",
    "limit , it is more convenient to work with the _ probability density _",
    "@xmath20\\ ] ] and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the appropriate scaling variable for this problem .",
    "= 2.9truein    there is an apparent simplicity of the formulation of the problem , i.e. it is similar ( and related ) to the classical rw problems@xcite , such as the problem of first passage times or the problem of last return to the starting point , for which probability distributions can be computed exactly by using the method of reflections@xcite , and obey the same scaling in the continuum limit .",
    "however , the search for the _ longest _ loop of the rw , among all possible starting points , creates a more complicated problem . in its essence",
    ", the problem is more related to the statistics of self  avoiding , rather than regular , random walks .",
    "this relation becomes more transparent in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 limits .",
    "the former limit had been extensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the latter will be discussed in sec.[numerical ] .",
    "the  self ",
    "interacting nature \" of the problem can be seen even more clearly in its generalizations to arbitrary space dimension @xmath25 , where many analogies between this problem and the self  avoiding walks exist .",
    "our earlier investigations revealed remarkable properties of the probability density @xmath26 : it diverges as @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and has a discontinuous derivative at @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , it has an essential singularity at @xmath30 of the form @xmath31 .",
    "an analytical solution in this limit still remains elusive .",
    "we had not been able to determine @xmath26 even numerically below @xmath32 due to the very small probabilities involved near @xmath30 , severely limiting a straightforward monte carlo approach . because of these difficulties , the existence and precise form of this singularity ( including possible power law prefactors etc . )",
    "was not well established . since the publication of that work , we have developed an improved monte carlo algorithm that is capable of probing significantly smaller values of @xmath33 numerically .",
    "combined with strict analytical bounds on @xmath34 , the results strongly favor the existence of this singularity , and the proper form of the @xmath24 limit can be determined with high precision . in this paper",
    ", we report the results of these complementary findings .",
    "it should be noted that similar behavior is exhibited by extremal properties of a number of random processes , such as a one - dimensional random cutting process@xcite ( which can be generalized to higher dimensions@xcite ) and return times in a random walk@xcite .",
    "these models exhibit singularities at @xmath5 , which become progressively weaker as the integer @xmath6 is increased , leading to an essential singularity at @xmath30 .",
    "although it was claimed that our problem falls into the same category and therefore should exhibit singularities at @xmath35@xcite , we believe that it differs from these models in a way that undermines the reasoning for this claim , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ related ] .",
    "in particular , we have numerically verified that the suggested singularity at @xmath36 does not exist , unless it has a very small prefactor .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : first , we establish upper and lower bounds on @xmath34 .",
    "we then describe an efficient monte carlo algorithm that enables us to determine @xmath34 down to very small values , and present results from its implementation .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible relevance of other random models with similar characteristic properties .",
    "in this section , we establish rigorous upper and lower bounds on the probability distribution @xmath34 , both of which have the same functional form .",
    "the existence of these bounds significantly restrict possible asymptotic forms of @xmath34 in the @xmath37 limit .",
    "the main strategy is the similar for establishing both upper and lower bounds .",
    "walks whose largest loops are much smaller than their overall length are typically very biased in one direction , and sections of the walk that are separated by more than the largest loop size are very weakly correlated . for",
    "a given ( small ) value of @xmath33 , let us divide each walk into roughly @xmath38 segments of similar size .",
    "there are _ necessary _ conditions that each segment must satisfy independently for the overall walk to contribute to @xmath34 .",
    "if the probability for a random segment to satisfy these conditions is @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , each segment can be designed to satisfy certain conditions that are _ sufficient _ to ensure that the overall walk contributes to @xmath34 . if the corresponding probability for these conditions is @xmath41 , then @xmath42 .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to establishing a set necessary and sufficient conditions and calculating the corresponding probabilities .",
    "let us first investigate necessary conditions .",
    "let @xmath43 be an @xmath0step walk whose largest loop is less than @xmath1steps long , and has @xmath44 .",
    "we shall focus on the cases where @xmath45 is an integer for now .",
    "let us split @xmath43 into @xmath46 mutually exclusive segments @xmath47 of length @xmath1 where @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath43 satisfies the inequalities @xmath49 or , equivalently , @xmath50 i.e. each of the @xmath46 segments need to have a positive displacement . the probability for this is just @xmath51 , and therefore @xmath52 ( the additional factor of 2 comes from rws with @xmath53 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath54 for any value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this establishes a strict upper bound , which is significant for small values of @xmath33 : @xmath55 it is possible to further improve on this upper bound , and we will next demonstrate such an improvement which is by no means final . consider a pair of adjacent segments ( e.g. @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) described above , with @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the _",
    "smallest _ index where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 the _ largest _ index where @xmath61 . in that case , the segment from @xmath15 to @xmath62 ( on @xmath43 ) is a loop , and therefore @xmath63 since @xmath43 can not have a loop larger than @xmath1 . for two randomly selected segments , this condition is satisfied with probability @xmath13 , which can be calculated from the known probability distribution of `` last return to the origin''@xcite .",
    "since there are @xmath64 statistically independent adjacent pairs , this observation further suppresses the upper bound on the probability distribution by a factor of @xmath65 , improving the overall upper bound to @xmath66 which makes the best ( so far ) analytical lower bound on the exponential factor @xmath67 .    in order to find a lower bound on the probability distribution ,",
    "let us again consider the sequence @xmath43 and its @xmath46 pieces @xmath68 of length @xmath1 each .",
    "we d like to construct each @xmath69 independently in such a way to guarantee that the resulting walk @xmath43 does not have loops larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this can again be done in many different ways , and the following is by no means optimal .",
    "the quality of the bound usually depends on how complicated the specifications of each piece are , and the limiting factor seems to be the analytical tractability of the associated probabilities .",
    "the following represents the best bound we have been able to establish analytically .",
    "the specifications of each piece is as follows : @xmath70 figure  [ lowerbound](a ) shows these specifications graphically .",
    "clearly , @xmath71 is required .",
    "figure  [ lowerbound](b ) shows how the joining of such pieces results in a sequence @xmath43 that has no loops larger than @xmath1 .",
    "= 2.9truein    the probability @xmath41 of meeting the stated specifications can be evaluated numerically to high accuracy using the method of reflections@xcite and summing over all possible values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for a given @xmath74 .",
    "the largest value for the probability yields the tightest lower bound on @xmath34 , so it is desirable to tune @xmath74 in order to optimize the bound .",
    "we pick @xmath75 , which is very close to the optimal value . in that case , the probability for a rw to satisfy the requirements ( [ eqlower ] ) for large @xmath1 is @xmath76 .",
    "this yields @xmath77 clearly , neither the upper nor the lower bounds we have established are very tight , and they do not rule out the possibility of a power - law prefactor .",
    "however , there is very convincing numerical evidence that there is no power law prefactor in @xmath34 , i.e. that @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constants that are determined in the following section .",
    "in this section , we present numerical studies to determine @xmath26 and @xmath34 in the @xmath81 limit .",
    "as stated earlier@xcite , a standard monte carlo method of determining @xmath26 from a random sample of all possible walks is ineffective at probing @xmath82 , since the probabilities become very small .",
    "a similar problem arises when it is necessary to randomly sample very large self - avoiding walks ( saws ) in two and three dimensions : the probability of generating a saw is exponentially small in its overall length , i.e. the probability of picking a saw out of rws of length @xmath83 scales as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants that depend only on the dimensionality of the saw .",
    "a common way to circumvent this problem is to build large saws recursively by joining smaller saws .",
    "this method significantly reduces the number of operations needed by completely eliminating its dependence on the leading exponential factor : the probability of creating a saw of length @xmath0 by joining two randomly selected saws of length @xmath87 scales only as @xmath88 , and the number of operations needed to generate a randomly sampled saw grows as @xmath89 instead of @xmath90 . of course",
    ", creating saws in one dimension is trivial , but the extension of this method to one - dimensional walks is still very useful for our problem , since creating rws with very small loops is similar to creating saws [ in fact @xmath91 , and can be used to sample @xmath34 efficiently at small @xmath33 .    in this implementation of the algorithm , we start from pairs of rws of length @xmath1 ( with nonzero total displacement ) and join them , keeping only resultant walks whose largest loops are smaller than @xmath1 . at the first level , this creates walks that contribute to @xmath92 , with equal probability .",
    "we then iterate this process by pairing the resultant walks at each level . after the @xmath93th level",
    ", we end up with a representative sample of all walks that contribute to @xmath94 , which can then be used to determine a histogram for the probability distributions for @xmath95 .",
    "we also need keep track of the probability of success @xmath96 at each level , which is given by @xmath97 ^ 2},\\ ] ] in order to determine the overall normalization of the probability distributions .",
    "one big advantage of studying one - dimensional walks is that the probability of success @xmath98 actually becomes _ independent of _",
    "@xmath93 , i. e. , in the continuum limit @xmath99 ^ 2 , \\ ; \\ell\\ll 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is a nonzero constant .",
    "( for the one - dimensional saw , the probability of success is just @xmath13 . ) typically , variations in @xmath98 were within statistical fluctuations ( 0.1 to 0.3% ) for @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath98 is independent of @xmath93 , the number of operations needed to sample a representative walk that contributes to @xmath34 is only polynomial in @xmath102 , which speeds up the algorithm enormously .",
    "furthermore , this implies that for @xmath81 , @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath80 are constants ; there are no power - law prefactors in @xmath34 .",
    "this result can be verified numerically by looking at the results of the described recursive algorithm : fig .",
    "[ psmallell ] confirms the functional form ( [ eqpell ] ) over about twelve decades in the probability density @xmath26 , probing values of @xmath33 down to 0.04@xcite .",
    "= 2.9truein    the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the continuum limit can be determined accurately by plotting their dependence on walk length .",
    "@xmath79 is simply the inverse of the success probability @xmath105 as mentioned earlier , whereas @xmath80 is given by the slope of the graph in fig  [ psmallell ] .",
    "[ finitesize ] shows these plots , which yield @xmath106 .",
    "behavior that is strikingly similar to those of @xmath26 are exhibited by probability distributions of extremal properties in certain random systems .",
    "one simple example is a one  dimensional random cutting process@xcite : a unit interval is cut at a randomly selected point ( with uniform probability ) , and the same cutting process is repeatedly applied to the interval that remains to the _ right _ of the latest cut , ad infinitum .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath107 for the size of the _ largest _ interval that remains at the end of the cutting process exhibits singularities of the form @xmath108 at each value of @xmath6 , which become progressively weaker as the integer @xmath6 is increased , leading to an essential singularity at @xmath30 .",
    "the origin of these singularities can be traced to the fact that the pieces ( among which the largest one is chosen ) constitute a _ partition _ of the entire interval , which implies that the sum of the sizes of all pieces equals the size of the initial interval , which is 1 .",
    "consequently , any piece that is larger than @xmath13 is necessarily the largest , and in general there can be at most @xmath109 pieces that are larger than @xmath110 .",
    "this causes singular behavior in @xmath107 at @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "similar `` sum rules '' apply to the all the other systems that are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , this property is not satisfied by our problem , since loops can and do overlap .",
    "we have numerically examined the vicinity of @xmath36 , and conclude that there are no singularities in the first and second derivatives of @xmath26 with a prefactor of @xmath111 .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility of weaker singularities or unusually small prefactors , the evidence seems to suggest that they do not exist .",
    "with the help of an efficient monte carlo algorithm and analytical upper and lower bounds , we have clarified some of the issues surrounding the behavior of the probability density @xmath26 for small values of its argument , and we have been able to better understand and characterize the essential singularity at @xmath30 . in this limit , the connection of this problem to saws becomes much more transparent , and it is likely that this connection can be further exploited .",
