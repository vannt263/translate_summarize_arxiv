    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are known to be the main contributors to the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "synthesis models suggested that the shape of the x - ray background requires a mixture of unabsorbed and absorbed agns ( setti & woltjer 1989 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; gilli , salvati , & hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "this scenario has been verified by the recent chandra and xmm surveys which have resolved most of the x - ray background up to energies of 10  kev ( brandt et al . 2001 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ; hasinger et al . 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , the optical identification of the sources making the x - ray background , as well as their x - ray spectra , revealed both obscured and unobscured agns , though unusual agns were also identified ( e.g. mainieri et al .",
    "2002 ; barger et al . 2003",
    "; fiore et al .",
    "the x - ray surveys have also provided evidence that the evolution of agns is different with respect to that known from previous optical surveys .",
    "in particular , the evolution of low - luminosity agn ( in the seyfert range ) peaks at much lower redshift ( z@xmath00.5 ) than for more luminous , qso - like agns ( hasinger 2003 ; fiore et al .",
    "2003 ; ueda et al .",
    "this luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) seems to apply both to unobscured and obscured agns .",
    "the circumnuclear gas responsible for the x - ray absorption is associated with dust which absorbs the optical - uv radiation from the agn and reprocesses it thermally into the infrared .",
    "dust infrared emission has been observed in all agns ( except in some bl lacs and radio - loud quasars where the ir radiation may be dominated by the relativistically boosted synchrotron radiation ) . at least in the near and mid - ir , it has been recognized that a significant fraction of the dust radiation is due to heating by the agn ( e.g. granato , danese , & franceschini 1997 ; maiolino et al .",
    "1998a ; oliva et al .",
    "1999 ; glass 2004 ; minezaki et al .",
    "for this reason it has been argued that agns may contribute significantly also to the ir cosmic background .",
    "this issue is of utmost importance , since it would also have implications on the fraction of ir background which should be ascribed to star formation .",
    "some previous studies have estimated the contribution of agn to the ir background or to the source number counts ( granato et al .",
    "1997 ; matute et al . 2002",
    "; risaliti , elvis , & gilli 2002 ; andreani , spinoglio , & malkan 2003 ) .",
    "the main ingredients for this estimate are the luminosity function ( lf ) and evolution of agns and their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "previous works have adopted the observationally available , still largely incomplete , lf of agns , that only very recently has been better defined through chandra and xmm surveys ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) . generally , a single template for the agn sed has been assumed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the contribution of agns to the ir background and counts by using the most recent luminosity functions and evolution obtained by the recent hard x - ray surveys .",
    "we also use ir spectral energy distributions accurately derived by means of nuclear ir data for a sample of seyfert galaxies ( both obscured and unobscured ) and which allow us to disentangle the agn ir emission from the contribution of the host galaxy .",
    "these data also allow us to directly connect the ir emission of agns to their intrinsic x - ray emission .",
    "moreover , we use the novel approach of dividing the observed ir seds into intervals of different agn obscuration , in terms of n@xmath4 along the line of sight .",
    "this is the same method adopted in the synthesis of the x - ray background .",
    "these various pieces of information combined together allow us to _ directly connect the x - ray background ( dominated by agns ) to the ir background without strong assumptions , by using only observed and measured quantities .",
    "_    throughout the paper we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the most recent results from the hard x - ray surveys ( both shallow and deep ) have been gathered by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to produce the hard x - ray luminosity function and evolution of agns .",
    "these luminosity functions derived in the hard x - rays are optimal for our purposes , because they are much less affected by obscuration than the luminosity function derived at other wavelengths .",
    "residual incompleteness in the fraction of heavily obscured agn has been accounted for ( see discussion below for the case of compton thick agns ) .",
    "ueda et al . ( 2003 ) derive these quantities also by consistently requiring that the whole x - ray background is properly fitted .",
    "they also match the optical luminosity functions and evolution ( boyle et al . 2000 ) by assuming appropriate ratios between x - ray and optical luminosity .",
    "we direct the reader to ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for more details on their method and on the properties of their derived luminosity functions . here",
    "we only summarize two important results of their work which are relevant for this paper .",
    "the density evolution of agns is strongly dependent on their luminosity : the evolution of seyfert galaxies peaks at a much lower redshift ( z@xmath20.30.5 ) than the more luminous qsos ( whose evolution peaks beyond z@xmath81 ) .",
    "the other important result is that the various observational constraints indicate that the fraction of obscured agns decreases with luminosity . in particular , at high , qso - like luminosities , the fraction of obscured agn is lower by a factor of about 2 with respect to seyfert nuclei .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the prescriptions by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the luminosity functions , evolution and distribution in absorbing column densities @xmath9 , which properly reproduce the results from the x - ray surveys and the x - ray background . for compton thick sources with @xmath10 , which contribute significantly to the 30  kev bump of the x - ray background , but which are poorly sampled by the current surveys at energies lower than 10  kev , we adopt the same strategy of ueda et al . by assuming that their fraction is the same as for agns with @xmath11 ( consistent with the observations of local agns , risaliti , maiolino , & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "ueda et al . ( 2003 ) also showed that this fraction of compton thick sources consistently reproduces the shape of the x - ray background ( especially at 30  kev ) .",
    "compton thick agn with @xmath12 do not contribute significantly to the x - ray background at any energy , since they are totally absorbed and only their scattered component is observed , and therefore they are generally neglected in the synthesis models of the x - ray background .",
    "however , this class of heavily absorbed agn could contribute significantly to the ir background and therefore this population must be included in our model .",
    "we assume that the fraction of compton thick agn with @xmath13 is the same as those with @xmath14 and with @xmath11 , again consistent with the observations of local agns ( risaliti et al .",
    "various authors have derived the spectral energy distribution of agn in the ir ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; spinoglio , andreani , & malkan 2002 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2003 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "however , in many cases their approach is not adequate for our purposes .    at least for what concerns seyfert galaxies we need to know the nuclear infrared spectral energy distribution i.e. the infrared light associated with the dust heated by the agn and also direct agn emission ( at this stage without the contribution by the host galaxy ) .",
    "the infrared sed must be known both for unobscured agns and for agns obscured by various levels of obscuration , and even for the most obscured compton thick agn .",
    "we need a large wavelength coverage , @xmath15 to 1000 @xmath1 m in order to estimate the contribution of agns to the near - ir to sub - mm background as well as to the source counts in the spitzer , iso and scuba bands . for each ir",
    "sed we also need to know its normalization in terms of _ intrinsic _ hard x - ray flux , this will allow us to link the ir seds to the hard x - ray luminosity functions .",
    "we selected from the literature a large sample of seyfert galaxies for which _ nuclear _ near - ir and mid - ir observations have detected clear signatures of _ non - stellar _ nuclear emission , and where the stellar contribution has been properly removed . among these",
    "we only choose those objects having at least four nuclear photometric points and at least one of them must be in the mid - ir ( 10@xmath1 m and/or 20@xmath1 m ) ; such a minimum set of data is required for a proper interpolation with the models discussed below .",
    "we also required that the sources had hard x - ray measurements good enough to provide the intrinsic ( i.e. unabsorbed ) hard x - ray flux and a measure of the absorbing column density @xmath9 .",
    "in particular we require that the x - ray data allow a measurement of n@xmath4 with an accuracy of about 50% at least , or that they allow to set an upper limit on n@xmath4 below 10@xmath16  @xmath17 ( below this value the absorption of the 210  kev luminosity is negligible ) .",
    "a total of 33 seyfert nuclei matched these requirements ( see appendix ) .",
    "most of these seyferts are from the maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) sample .",
    "the list of seyferts used to derive the ir seds , along with the references for the data and some additional details are given in the appendix .",
    "the nuclear ir data were then _ interpolated _ with the updated models of granato & danese ( 1994 ) .",
    "these models were generated by means of a detailed radiative transfer code for dust heated by a nuclear central source with a typical agn spectrum .",
    "the code includes various possible geometries and physics for the distribution of the circumnuclear dust ( torus with variable height , radii and density , as well as tapered disks ) .",
    "the code also allows variation in the distribution of dust grain sizes , to account for possible deviations from the standard ism extinction curve as suggested by some recent works ( maiolino , marconi , & oliva 2001 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2001 ; gaskell et al .",
    "there are several other models which have been proposed to describe the circumnuclear dust emission in agns ( e.g. pier & krolik 1993 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; nenkova , ivezic , & elitzur 2002 ) .",
    "however , we do not want to discuss here the different features of the various models and which of them may be more appropriate to describe the properties of the circumnuclear dust in agn . in this paper the models",
    "are simply used to interpolate the observed nuclear ir data with a physically plausible sed .",
    "as long as the latter is constrained by the data , the choice of the specific model does not change the results concerning the interpolated spectral region , typically within @xmath18 m .",
    "more critical is the _ extrapolation _ of the models beyond 20@xmath1 m , where nuclear ir data are not available ( only large aperture data from iso or iras are available at @xmath19 m ) . in this spectral region",
    "there is some degeneracy among models .",
    "our best fitting models ( for each individual agn of our sample ) generally suggest a drop of the ir emission redward of @xmath230 - 50@xmath1 m .",
    "some authors propose models which fit relatively flat sed to data up to 100@xmath1 m ( andreani , franceschini , & granato 1999 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "as discussed in several works on ir emission by agns , mir data are generally better reproduced by models in which the sed drops in the fir ( e.g. granato & danese 1994 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; galliano et al .",
    "moreover those models with relatively flat fir seds would require the existence of very extended dusty torii ( @xmath20 kpc , e.g. andreani et al .",
    "this is difficult to justify , and in any case , it has been excluded at least for ngc1068 , whose torus has been directly observed ( jaffe et al .",
    "+ however , the far - ir part of our nuclear agn seds remains subject to strong uncertainties and admittedly model dependent .",
    "+    . the solid line is the sed for sy1s , the dotted line for sy2s with @xmath21 , the short - dashed line for sy2s with @xmath22 and the long - dashed line is for sy2s with @xmath10.,width=302 ]    the seds of the single objects were then normalized by the intrinsic , unabsorbed x - ray flux in the 2 - 10  kev band .",
    "note that this prevents us using objects with @xmath23 ( such as ngc1068 , matt et al .",
    "1997 ) , because their x - ray radiation it totally absorbed at all energies and therefore the intrinsic x - ray emissions can not be recovered .",
    "the issue of the inclusion of this class of objects in our model will be discussed in section 5 .    the x - ray ",
    "normalized infrared seds were then divided into intervals of absorption in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "we do not enter into the issue of the mismatch between gas absorption in the x - rays and dust absorption in the optical / infrared ( maiolino et al .",
    "2001 ) and , more specifically , that dust absorption is generally significantly lower than expected by a galactic dust - to - gas ratio and by a galactic extinction curve .",
    "regardless of such physical issues , we simply follow the phenomenological approach of dividing the agns in terms of n@xmath4 ; this will then allow to properly match the _ observationally _ more adequate ir sed to each class of absorbed agn used to synthesize the x - ray background .",
    "the resulting average infrared seds are shown in fig .",
    "[ nuc_sed ] .",
    "note that in our sample of sy2 there are no objects with @xmath24 , the inclusion of this class of agn ( which is only a minor fraction of the whole population , as found both locally and in the hard x - ray surveys , risaliti et al .",
    "1999 , ueda et al . 2003 ) will be discussed in section 5 .    the main difference between the seds of sy1 and the sed of sy2s with @xmath25 is absorption in the near - ir at @xmath26 and some mild silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath1 m .",
    "for sy2s with @xmath27 the shape of the ir sed does not change significantly except for a slight , overall increase of the emission .",
    "the finding that the shape of the ir sed remains unchanged indicates that the medium absorbing the x - rays with @xmath28 is either too small in size to obscure the near - ir emitting region or that its dust content / composition is unable to effectively absorb the near - ir radiation .",
    "the slight increase of the overall ir emission might indicate a slight increase of the covering factor of the circumnuclear dust .",
    "however one should keep in mind that the number of objects used to create the average seds is still small and therefore statistical fluctuations may still be significant . for compton thick sy2s ( @xmath29 )",
    "the ir sed is significantly different , showing a prominent absorption even in the mid - ir ( although still much lower than expected by the dust associated with a compton thick medium and with a galactic gas - to - dust ratio and composition ) .",
    "disentangling the nuclear infrared emission from the contribution of the host galaxy is a much more difficult task for quasars .",
    "indeed at their larger distances , even small apertures include a significant fraction of the host galaxy .",
    "resolving the host galaxies in several quasars has been achieved by various authors in the near - ir ( mcleod & rieke 1994a , b ; surace , sanders , & evans 2001 ) , but at longer wavelengths ( @xmath30 m ) we still have integrated information .",
    "infrared data are generally available for unobscured quasars , while there is little information on the ir emission of the few type 2 quasars known . for these reasons",
    "we assume that the shape of the infrared emission as a function of the obscuration is the same as for the seyfert nuclei .",
    "however the normalization to the x - ray flux can not be assumed to be the same , since it is known that the x - ray radiation decreases relative to ( at least ) the optical - uv radiation at high luminosities . to determine the normalization factor we adopt again an observational approach .",
    "we merged the samples of quasars measured in the infrared by andreani et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2003 ) and haas et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "these samples are all selected in the optical and , therefore , include only unobscured quasars .",
    "we selected only those quasars having at least four ir detections , at least one of which is in the far - ir , thus allowing a proper determination of their total ir sed .",
    "the latter criterion may bias our sample in favor of ir - bright quasars and with excess of star formation , as discussed below .",
    "we further selected only those quasars which also have x - ray measurements ( good enough to ensure that there is no significant n@xmath4 absorption affecting the observed l@xmath31 ) .",
    "then we assume that at 12@xmath1 m the qso integrated radiation is dominated by the qso light , which is a reasonable approximation , since at this wavelength the agn radiation is strong while the radiation from the galaxy is close to its minimum .",
    "we determine the average ratio @xmath32 for all quasars in our sample and use this quantity to scale the sed derived for sy1s relative to the x - ray emission . then the sed of obscured quasars are derived from the sed of sy2s by re - scaling them to maintain the same intensity relative to unobscured quasars ( i.e. the same relative intensities shown in fig .",
    "[ nuc_sed ] ) .",
    "the average ratio @xmath33 derived for quasars is only a factor 1.4 higher than for sy1s ( 2.5 ) .",
    "this result may sound odd , since when looking at the optical - uv bands the ratio f(opt)/f(x ) is higher by a factor of three in quasars relative to seyferts .",
    "our finding is suggestive that the covering factor of dust is lower at higher luminosities , which reduces the overall ir flux relative to the optical radiation .",
    "this issue has been briefly discussed in maiolino ( 2002 ) and will be subject of a forthcoming more detailed paper ( maiolino & granato , in prep . ) .",
    "this finding is also in agreement with the recent results by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by hasinger ( 2003 ) who find that the fraction of obscured agn at high , quasar - like luminosities is lower than in seyferts .",
    "we have also investigated the contribution by the host galaxies of agn .",
    "this is a more uncertain investigation since it relies on the assumption that the relation between host galaxy and nuclear emission is , at high redshift , the same as observed in local galaxies .",
    "the additional problem is that our method requires a proportionality between infrared sed and x - ray luminosity .",
    "there is no reason , in principle , to assume that the host galaxy infrared light is proportional to the agn - dominated x - ray light ( this is a conceptual problem also of other works , as discussed in section  7 ) .",
    "however , various studies have shown that the two phenomena , star formation and agn , are related and must yield to the well known correlation between black hole mass and bulge mass ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , croom et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the _ optical _ luminosity of the host galaxy scales as @xmath34 , although with a large scatter .",
    "we therefore investigated the seds of the host galaxies as a function of the ( x - ray ) luminosity of the active nucleus .",
    "we collected all infrared measurements which , especially for seyferts , include the contribution of both the nucleus and the host galaxy ( e.g. iras and 2mass total photometry ) .",
    "we then subtracted from the integrated photometric points the contribution of the nucleus estimated as discussed in section  3 .",
    "the residuals were then fitted with galaxy models ( a combination of active and quiescent stellar populations ) obtained with the publicly available code grasil ( silva et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the resulting seds of the host galaxies were normalized by the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus ( which is required to link the seds to the agns evolution and luminosity functions ) , grouped in intervals of luminosity and then averaged within each group .",
    "[ host_sed ] shows the infrared seds of the host galaxies , normalized to the x - ray luminosity , and averaged within various ranges of l@xmath35 . as expected the host galaxy contribution relative to the active nucleus decreases at higher agn luminosities . at quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath36 ) the luminosity of the host decreases in the near - ir but not significantly in the far - ir",
    "this may indicate that the hosts of high luminosity agns are undergoing to enhanced star formation , similar to that found by the sdss ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) , but may also be a bias due to our selection criterion for quasars in our sample ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "the total seds were simply obtained by combining the nuclear sed ( section  3 ) and the seds from the host galaxies for each range of luminosity ( @xmath37 ) and agn absorption ( @xmath9 ) .    , dotted for galaxies hosting agn with @xmath38 , short - dashed for galaxies hosting agn with @xmath39 and long - dashed for galaxies hosting agn with @xmath40,width=302 ]",

    "( 2003 ) , provide us all the information needed to connect the x - ray cosmic background to the infrared background .    for agns with ( mild ) absorption in the range",
    "@xmath41 we have no ir sed ( see appendix ) , since this is a rare class of agn in the local universe and therefore there are no representatives in our sample . however at @xmath42 , even for a galactic dust - to - gas ratio , the absorption in the ir is negligible ( less than 0.2  mag even in the 2@xmath1 m band ) . therefore",
    ", for this class of agn we assume the same ir sed as type 1 seyfert , and with the optical direct component absorbed ( yet the optical spectrum is not of interest since it is not investigated in this paper ) .",
    "compton thick agns absorbed by @xmath23 are not included in ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) because their contribution to the x - ray background is negligible ( totally absorbed at all energies and only a weak reflection component is observed in the x - rays ) .",
    "however , their reprocessed radiation is observed in the infrared ( the stereotype case is ngc1068 ) . as discussed in section  3 , we can not derive the ir sed of this class of objects normalized to the x - ray emission just because it is not possible to measure their intrinsic x - ray luminosity ( and anyhow only ngc1068 has the required data to derive a nuclear ir sed ) .",
    "therefore we assume that absorbed agns with @xmath23 have the same ir sed as the agns with @xmath43 both in terms of shape and in terms of normalization relative to the intrinsic x - ray emission .",
    "we further assume , based on the @xmath44 distribution of local seyferts ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ) , that the fraction of agn with @xmath23 is the same as the fraction of agns with @xmath43 .",
    "another issue is the definition of the dividing luminosity between `` seyferts '' and `` quasars '' , i.e. what are the luminosity ranges where the two different classes of seds should be used .",
    "this issue is actually little important since as discussed in section  [ sec : sedqsonuc ] the nuclear seds for seyferts and quasars are nearly identical ( just 40% difference in the normalization )",
    ". traditionally , in the x - rays the dividing luminosity is taken at about @xmath45 in the 210  kev band , which roughly corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath46 .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath47 appears to be an adequate dividing luminosity also for the seyfert 1s and the quasars in our samples ( see appendix ) , and therefore we will consistently use this dividing luminosity .    to compare the contribution of agn to the ir bands with that due to normal / starburst galaxies ( i.e. galaxies powered only by stars ) , we have also included the contribution by the latter , as described in silva et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . there",
    ", the galaxy populations accounted for are spheroidal galaxies ( based on the model by granato et al .",
    "2004 ) , and late - type galaxies ( spirals and starbursts ) .",

    "our estimated contribution of agn ( without hosts ) to the ir background is shown in fig .",
    "[ bg_nuc ] .",
    "the main result is that agn contribute little to the overall ir background .",

    "but that leap is mostly due to the transition between the evolutionary regime assumed for late - type galaxies in the mir to sub - mm region and in the nir ( see silva et al .",
    "2004 )    at all infrared wavelengths @xmath50 m the agn contribution is dominated by heavily obscured seyfert nuclei ( @xmath51 ) , in particular at @xmath52 m the contribution is dominated by compton thick seyferts ( @xmath53 ) .    in fig .",

    "these values are higher than predicted by our model because the iso sources also include the contribution by the host galaxies .",
    "therefore the comparison with these results will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we point out that recently growing evidence has been found for a class of totally buried and optically elusive agn in nearby galaxies ( della ceca et al .",
    "2002 ; maiolino et al . 2003 ; marconi et al .",
    ". this class of agns may be as numerous as classical , optically identified agn .",
    "most of them are compton thick and therefore , if they are present also at high redshift , they would mostly be missed even by current hard x - ray surveys . on the other hand",
    "their ir emission would provide an additional contribution to the ir background , which at the current stage is not included in our model .",
    "we also recall that , as described in section 3 , the far - ir nuclear seds of agn is not directly observed , therefore our estimated background in that spectral region is subject to higher uncertainties as compared to the near and mid - ir .",
    "the contribution of agns to the ir source counts is discussed only for the case of the agn+host seds in the next section , since available data refer to the total emission of sources .",
    "when the contribution by the host galaxy is included , the fraction of the ir background ascribed to agn+hosts is much higher .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ bg_ext ] .    the overall contribution is larger than 5% at all infrared wavelengths @xmath54 , and reaches about @xmath5510% for @xmath56 m .",
    "the contribution at 15@xmath1 m is nearly two times higher with respect to the case of agn alone ( i.e. agns and their host galaxies contribute nearly equally at this wavelength ) .",
    "the agn+host contribution decreases at longer wavelengths , but is still a few percent even in the sub - mm .",
    "the dominant contribution is due to the host galaxies of compton thick agns .",

    "( 2002 ) by the direct identification of the iso sources ( an identification survey which should be free by selection effects given that type 1 agns are unobscured and therefore easier to identify ) .",
    "our estimated total agn contribution to the 15@xmath1 m background is also close to that inferred by fadda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , though slightly lower .",
    "the slight difference with fadda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) may be due to a shortage of seyfert galaxies at high redshift in the adopted luminosity function , indeed ueda et al .",

    "but , apart a slight overestimate of the bright @xmath57 m differential counts ( fig .",
    "[ count_ext_15 ] ) , the models are still within the available observational constraints , therefore we keep the model for galaxies without modifications .",
    "this can introduce a slight underestimate of the relative importance of the hosts of agn at bright fluxes .",
    "the contribution by agn+hosts is considerable at all wavelengths shortward of @xmath2100@xmath1 m , exceeding 10% at intermediate to bright fluxes ( @xmath58mjy ) .    in the well studied band at 15@xmath1 m agn+hosts",

    "qualitatively our finding is in agreement with the recent study by la franca et al .",
    "( 2004 ) whose optical identification of the iso 15@xmath1 m sources ( combined with their preliminary results on x - ray identifications , la franca et al . , in prep . ) indicate a rapidly increasing fraction of agns at high fluxes .",
    "quantitatively la franca et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find only half of the agns expected by our model , but the statistical errorbars are actually consistent with our values at the 1@xmath61 level .",
    "however , if one wishes to investigate this marginal inconsistency , one possibility , as suggested by la franca et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , could be that optical spectroscopic identifications have missed a significant fraction of type 2 agns .",
    "our model indicates that most of the agns contributing to the source counts are heavily obscured ( compton thick ) and therefore are more likely to be missed by optical identification . in particular , maiolino et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have clearly shown that several compton thick agn have been missed by optical spectroscopy even in nearby galaxies .",
    "la franca et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "attempt to account for such optically elusive agns , by exploiting the current results on this regard from x - ray surveys .",
    "nonetheless as pointed out both by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2003 ) most of such compton thick agn are probably missed even by the latest hard x - ray surveys .",
    "another possibility , as suggested by the comparison with la franca et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , is that the extrapolation of the luminosity functions by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) tend to overestimate the density of agns at low redshift .",
    "a much more critical issue is the contribution of agn to the number counts at 850@xmath1 m .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found that about half of the submm sources brighter than 5  mjy host a seyfert nucleus . in a more recent work , alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) identify most of these sources as galaxies at z@xmath22 ( i.e. at a redshift comparable with most of the submm sources at this limiting flux ) .",
    "our model predicts that only a few percent of the submm sources host an agn at fluxes @xmath62  mjy .",
    "again , the main problem seems to be that the luminosity functions of ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) underestimate the number of seyfert galaxies at high redshift .    indeed , at z@xmath82 the luminosity function at seyfert luminosities is not tightly constrained by the observational data available to ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and therefore it is mostly extrapolated from lower redshifts .",
    "this issue may also affect our estimated contribution of agn hosts to the far - ir bands of spitzer .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this issue and of the possible implications for the seyferts evolution at high redshift will be discussed in an upcoming paper ( silva et al . in prep . ) .",
    "an additional problem might be our modelling of the hosts sed in the submm .",
    "indeed , due to the lack of submm data for most of the sources in our sample , the long wavelength tail of the seds in fig .",
    "[ host_sed ] are mostly obtained by extrapolating the far - ir data with theoretical models which fit properly the seds of local starburst and quiescent galaxies . however",
    ", such extrapolation may be wrong by some factor .",
    "in the spitzer bands with @xmath63 m we expect that important fractions of the total detected sources will be provided by galaxies hosting an agn .",
    "this is particularly true at bright flux limits . at the sensitivity limits reported by lonsdale et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the swire suvey ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath1jy respectively for the irac @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath1 m bands , and @xmath72 mjy for the @xmath73 m band of mips ) , we get that @xmath74 to @xmath75% of the total sources host agns , with the maximum value at @xmath70 and @xmath76 m .    at the longer mips bands , @xmath77 and @xmath78 m , at flux limits in the ranges @xmath7910  mjy , and @xmath80100  mjy respectively",
    ", we expect that only a few percent of the detected sources will host an agn .",
    "however , at these long wavelengths our estimates may be affected by the same problem as for the submm sources as a consequence of the shortage of high - z seyferts in the ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model .",
    "in the previous section we have compared the predictions of our model with observational constraints at specific wavelengths .",
    "however , the contribution of agns to the ir background and ir number counts has been modelled and investigated by other authors in the past . in this section",
    "we compare our results with some of these previous studies .    in granato",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , predictions for the contribution of agns to the ir background and mir source counts were presented , starting from the x - ray background as a constraint .",
    "theoretical nuclear seds as a function of @xmath81 were used for agns , and the contribution by the host galaxy was considered in a very approximate manner .",
    "their results are within a factor of 2 as compared to ours for the nuclear emission by agns in the @xmath82 m range .",
    "the reason is that they assumed that the mir seds are ascribed to the agn only .    starting from their observed contribution to the 15@xmath1 m background from type 1 agn , matute et al .",
    "( 2002 ) infer the total contribution from all agn to the 15@xmath1 m background . under `` standard '' assumptions based on the unified theories they infer a total contribution of @xmath210%15% , which is similar to that inferred by us .",
    "risaliti , elvis , & gilli ( 2002 ) predict that the maximum contribution from agns to the infrared background occurs at 60@xmath1 m and at the level of 20%40% .",
    "this is significantly different from what predicted by our model ( which predicts a maximum contribution by agn+hosts at about 10@xmath1 m and not exceeding 20% .",
    "however , there are two main problems in risaliti et al .",
    "first , they assume the bolometric correction ( the proportionality between @xmath37 and @xmath83 ) typical of quasars , while it is now known that a large fraction of the x - ray background is produced at seyfert - like luminosities ( for which the bolometric correction is lower by a factor of about three ) .",
    "secondly , they assume that most of the quasars are absorbed ( 80%-90% ) , while recently it has become clear that at quasar luminosities the fraction of obscured agn is much lower than for seyfert , and more specifically the fraction of obscured agn at @xmath84 is only 30%-40% .",
    "these two factors are mostly responsible for the excess of ir background ascribed to agns in risaliti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "more recently andreani , spinoglio , & malkan ( 2003 ) have derived the contribution of various classes of active galaxies to the source number counts in different infrared bands .",
    "they consider separately the contribution by sy1s , sy2s and qso1s ( but not qso2s ) and use the seds inferred by spinoglio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which include the contribution from the host galaxies .",
    "therefore , their predictions should be comparable with our results in section [ sec : agnhost ] .",
    "they adopt pure luminosity evolutions from malkan & stecker ( 2001 ) and boyle et al .",
    "it is now clear that agns follow a luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) , however pure luminosity evolution formulas provide a reasonable approximation for the behavior of the bulk of agns around the knee of the luminosity function and above .",
    "the predictions on the source number counts obtained by andreani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the various ir bands are close to those obtained by us , at least for what concerns the _ total _ agn contribution . yet , our model predicts a larger contribution by obscured ( type 2 ) agn than predicted by andreani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . on this regard",
    ", one should keep in mind that the latter did not include the contribution by type 2 quasars .",
    "we have estimated the contribution to the infrared background and infrared number counts from agns by using the most recent agns luminosity functions and evolution from the hard x - ray surveys ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 ) and by connecting their x - ray and ir emission by means of new detailed agn seds derived by us .",
    "this approach allow us to derive the contribution of agn to the infrared background by using mostly observed and measured quantities , with little additional assumptions .",
    "the main results are the following :    1 .",
    "the agn nuclear ir radiation contributes little ( @xmath05% ) to the ir background at most wavelengths .",
    "agns along with their host galaxies contribute significantly ( @xmath2  520% ) to the ir background at @xmath85 .",
    "3 .   agns and their hosts probably dominate the mid - ir number counts at bright fluxes ( @xmath81  mjy ) .",
    "4 .   the predicted contribution of agns and of their host galaxies to the mid - ir background and number counts are in good agreement with the observational constraints available so far .",
    "however , we find a strong discrepancy between the expected contribution of seyfert host galaxies at high redshift to the submm background and number counts at bright fluxes .",
    "we ascribe this discrepancy mostly to the shortage of seyferts at high redshift ( z@xmath22 ) in the x - ray luminosity functions which , at these high redshifts and low luminosities , are still poorly constrained by the current hard x - ray surveys .",
    "this issue may also yield to underestimate the agn hosts contribution to the far - ir bands of spitzer .",
    "a more detailed investigation of this issue and of the possible implications for the seyferts evolution at high redshift will be discussed in an upcoming paper ( silva et al . in prep . ) .",

    "the sample and ir sed of compton thick sy2s with @xmath14 deserves some more discussion . near infrared observations of this class of objects shows more rarely indication of non stellar emission , strongly suggesting that heavy dust obscuration in these objects often prevents the detection of the nuclear near - ir source .",
    "of the 5 sy2s in this @xmath9 range only two ( namely ngc3281 and circinus ) show clear evidence for near - ir non stellar emission . for these we could fit the granato & danese ( 1994 ) models to the data and derive their nuclear ir sed .",
    "however , most likely these two objects represent the less absorbed cases of this class , therefore providing a biased view their sed .",
    "therefore we tried to account also for the sed of the more obscured agns . in the other three sources with @xmath86 ( namely ngc4945 , ngc3079 ,",
    "ngc5194 ) there is probably a detection of the obscured agn only at 10@xmath1 m ( e.g. krabbe , boker , & maiolino 2001 ) .",
    "we used the ir sed determined for circinus and ngc3281 , normalized to the x - ray intrinsic flux of the three sources and then increased the obscuration of the granato & danese ( 1994 ) model ( by increasing the inclination angle of the torus ) until the sed matched the observed 10@xmath1 m nuclear photometry , with the additional constraint that the integrated nuclear ir emission should not change .",
    "this is a rough method to include the sed of the very obscured agn with @xmath10 , but it is the best guess that can be made with the available data .",
