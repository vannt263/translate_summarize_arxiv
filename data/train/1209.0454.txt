    "quantum tensor networks are a competitive tool to study strongly correlated quantum systems on a lattice .",

    "both peps and mera can be applied to strongly correlated fermions in 2d @xcite , because they do not suffer from the notorious fermionic sign problem .",

    "in contrast to the ground state , thermal states have been explored mainly with the mps in 1d @xcite , but they are more interesting in 2d , where they can undergo finite temperature phase transitions . in 2d thermal states were represented by tensor product states and contracted with the help of the higher - order singular value decomposition in ref .",

    "this `` recycling '' would accelerate convergence in the next step because there would be very little to converge .",

    "a noise at the level of @xmath62 of a typical tensor element was enough for the algorithm to produce the same results as if the tensors were reinitialized , but at a much faster rate .",
