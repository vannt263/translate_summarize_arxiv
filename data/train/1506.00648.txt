    "some of the most basic and important constraints on galaxy formation models are the present - day stellar mass function and the distribution of star formation among galaxies with different masses .",
    "the sloan digitital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has provided the measurements that underlie our current knowledge of the stellar masses ( @xmath4 ) and star formation rates ( sfrs ) of large samples of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss multi - wavelength ( @xmath5 ) imaging has been used to estimate luminosities and mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting stellar masses have been demonstrated to correlate tightly with total , dynamical mass estimates @xcite with a scatter of only 0.13 dex . @xcite use the @xcite photoionization model to convert nebular emission line fluxes from sdss spectroscopy into sfrs .",
    "@xcite provided sfrs based on galex uv fluxes .",
    "but these previous sdss studies did not account for the extra information enclosed in dust emission , when estimating both star formation rate and dust attenuation . here",
    "we present alternative @xmath4 and sfr estimates by extending the photometric wavelength coverage of the sdss spectroscopic sample to the near- and mid - infrared as enabled by wise @xcite , which provides allsky coverage at @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands sample the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which avoids the contribution from hot , young stars which can dominate at shorter wavelenghts .",
    "in addition , extinction is usually negligible in these bands . as a result ,",
    "near - infrared luminosities provides fairly accurate and precise stellar mass estimates , even in the absence of any other photometric or spectroscopic information @xcite .",
    "many authors have used @xmath9-photometry from spitzer or wise to compare with stellar mass estimates derived from photometry at @xmath10 and below ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we combine sdss and wise data to generalize the use @xmath11 m photometric information in estimating stellar masses .",
    "mid - infrared emission traces star - formation activity through the well - known correlation with pah emission , sampled by the wise 12@xmath1 band , and through the correlation with thermal radiation from dust , sampled by the wise 22@xmath1 band .",
    "a number of authors have compared star - formation rates from @xcite , based on optical emission lines , with mid - ir luminosities from wise ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these studies do not model the mid - ir luminosity to obtain sfrs that are independent of the emission - line based sfrs .    here",
    "we take the important step to include the full wise photometry and employ sed modeling that consistently treats the stellar emission along with the dust extinction _ and _ emission .",
    "this will result in more robust masses and star - formation rates for dusty galaxies and , in general , an alternative to the emission - line based sfrs from @xcite for the full sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample .",
    "this is not been attempted before for large samples of galaxies .",
    "@xcite provided a detailed multi - wavelength study of a small number of objects and will provide an important benchmark to test our results . @xcite performed sed fits across the uv to mid - ir wavelength in an exercise similar in approach as what we present here , but for those authors the focus lay on producing a set of representative templates : stellar mass and sfr estimates are not presented or discussed .",
    "@xcite analyze the mid - ir properties of the large gama sample , but there h@xmath12-based sfrs were used as a calibrator for the mid - ir luminosities from wise .",
    "as such , our study is the first to use the mid - ir luminosities of a large sample of galaxies ( the full sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample ) to estimate their sfrs in a manner that is entirely independent of optical emission line luminosities and other external calibrators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will describe the sdss and wise photometric datasets , with a particular focus on total flux measurements for extended sources . in section 3",
    "we will describe magphys @xcite , the sed fitting code , and test the robustness of the fitting results .",
    "in particular , we will test how well magphys can predict , with the available wavelength coverage of @xmath13 , the total ir luminosity .",
    "furthermore , we will compare our @xmath4 and sfr estimates with the @xcite measurements . in section 4",
    "we will describe the publicly released catalog with the fitting results for the entire sdss spectroscopic sample ( @xmath14800,000 galaxies ) . in section 5",
    "we will show , as an illustration , how star formation is distributed over galaxies with different masses and colors .",
    "we use ab magnitudes and adopt the cosmological parameters ( @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17)=(0.30,0.70,0.70 ) and adopt the @xcite stellar initial mass function .",

    "[ sample ] we use the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample as compiled in the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which contains 858,365 galaxies with reliable redshift measurements ( objtype = galaxy , zwarning=0 ) , distributed as shown in figure  [ swfig_z ] .",
    "we adopt modelflux and modelflux_ivar as the flux measurements and their uncertainties , with galactic extinction corrections as prescribed by @xcite . to account for the uncertainty in the extinction law , we propagate an uncertainty in @xmath19 in our flux uncertainty estimates .",
    "minimum uncertainties are added in quadrature : 0.05 mag for the @xmath20 band and 0.02 mag for the @xmath21 bands .",
    "this is aimed at preventing from small systematic uncertainties to dominate the our goodness - of - fit assessment and the uncertainties in our derived parameters . in case of catastrophic failures in the photometric measurements , which occasionally occurs in the @xmath20 and @xmath22 bands , we omit these data points from the fits .",
    "the sdss parent sample is cross - matched with the allwise source catalog .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies have counterparts ( 98.24% ) , identified as the brightest object within a search radius of 6 arcsec , similar to the wise psf . in line with the approach taken by @xcite and @xcite , most matches ( 99.08% )",
    "are found within a radius of 3 arcsec and the majority ( 91.20% ) do not have multiple matches within 6 arcsec .",
    "we provide a flag ( @xmath23 ) that indicates if there are one or more matches , but we do not exclude any matched sources _ a priori_. various flux measurements are provided by the allwise catalog . in order to minimize the effects of source blending we use the w?mpro and w?sigmpro flux measurements and their uncertainties .",
    "these are profile - fitted photometry measurements , performed simultaneously on neighboring sources , using the point spread function ( psf ) as the source model .",
    "most of the galaxies with counterparts have significant w1 and w2 flux measurements ( 98.83% ) . for w3 and w4 ,",
    "many of the flux measurements amount to upper limits ( 29.10% and 70.89% , respectively ) .",
    "the redshift distributions of galaxies with @xmath24  w3 and w4 detections are shown in figure [ swfig_z ]",
    ". we will provide flags to indicate which galaxies have detections , and which have upper limits .",
    "the usefulness of the upper limits will depend on the goals of the user .",
    "galaxies are typically smaller than the wise psf , but the amount by which w?mpro underestimate the total flux due to the spatial extent of the sources is not necessarily negligible .",
    "the w1 , w2 , and w3 bands all have very similar psfs with fwhm@xmath25  arcsec , while the w4 psf is larger ( @xmath26 )  arcsec .",
    "we investigate the missing light fraction for w1 , w2 , and w3 by generating with galfit @xcite a series of simulated light distributions with 2-dimensional srsic profiles convolved with the w1 psf models provided by @xcite , and inserted into empty sections of real w1 images .",
    "then , we use galfit to fit the psf model to the simulated images to measure the psf profile flux .",
    "we find that the difference between the psf profile flux and the true , total flux is mostly a function of the effective radius of the srsic profile , and hardly depends on input flux , axis ratio , or srsic index .",
    "for a typical size of 5 arcsec , we find that @xmath27 varies from 15.63 mag for srsic index @xmath28 to 15.65 mag for sersic index @xmath29 . based on these simulations",
    "we find that the psf profile magnitude underestimates the total flux by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the effective radius in arcsec .",
    "this correction is used whenever the size is larger than @xmath32  arcsec .",
    "we propagate the uncertainty in the adopted radius into delta m , which is in turn propagated into the flux uncertainty in flux .",
    "we use the @xmath33-band effective radii and apply a systematic correction of a factor @xmath34 downward to to convert from optical size to near - ir size .",
    "this conversion is based on the analysis of @xcite , who consistently measured sizes for a large set of galaxies across the wavelength range 0.4 to 2.2 @xmath1 .",
    "these corrected sizes and equation [ dm ] are then used to correct the w1 , w2 , and w3 fluxes .",
    "we use @xmath33-band effective radii are measured by @xcite when available , and otherwise devrad or exprad from the sdss catalog as appropriate .",
    "we prefer the @xcite measurements as their fitting methodology ( two - dimensional light profiles ) is more similar to the methodology used by @xcite ( the sdss pipeline fits one - dimensional light profiles ) .",
    "we note that the difference between the two versions of our w1/2/3 magnitude corrections is small : for objects for which both measurements are available the median difference is 0.03 mag , and the random scatter 0.14 mag .",
    "these uncertainties are small compared to the uncertainties in stellar masses and sfrs derived below .",
    "these final flux measurements , along with the applied corrections , are listed in the public catalog ( see section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "the median correction is 0.25 mag , with a scatter of -0.07 ( 16%-ile ) and + 0.18 ( 84%-ile ) .",
    "corrections for w4 , for which the psf is twice as wide , are not made .    to account for possible systematic uncertainties of the wise and sdss photometric systems and further systematic differences between the total flux measurements we adopt and propagate 0.1 mag uncertainties for all wise fluxes .",
    "we use magphys to fit the photometric sed @xcite .",
    "the public version of magphys contains 50,000 stellar population template spectra ( the optical photometric library ) and 50,000 pah+dust emission template spectra ( the infrared photometric library ) .",
    "the stellar emission templates use the @xcite stellar population synthesis models and are generated for a wide range of star formation histories parameterized as exponentially - declining models with superimposed random bursts of star formation .",
    "the seds are computed by adding the individual spectra of all simple stellar populations , weighed by mass .",
    "the original magphys library was constructed for modeling ir - luminous , star - bursting galaxies . the original magphys library from the public version with 50,000 stellar population template spectra was constructed for modelling star - forming galaxies and we extended the optical library to include 25,000 additional templates for more passive stellar populations .",
    "the infrared templates describe emission by dust .",
    "the total dust luminosity over 3 to 1000@xmath1 has components of emission from pahs and dust with a range of temperatures .",
    "the model contains the ambient ( diffuse ) interstellar medium and star - forming regions ( birth clouds ) .",
    "because stars are born in dense molecular clouds which dissipate typically after @xmath35 years , the sed of young stellar populations are attenuated by both dust in the birth clouds and dust in the ambient ism , while the sed of older populations is only attenuated by dust in the diffuse ism .",
    "the absorbed light is assumed to be re - emitted in the mid- and far - infrared , requiring conservation of energy .",
    "magphys fits seds in the observed frame .",
    "therefore , we generate libraries with model fluxes in the observed frame for a series of narrow redshift bins ( @xmath36 ) that span the range of our sample . the fitting process for each individual galaxy is then expediated in two ways .",
    "first , we only consider optical templates with similar @xmath37 colors as the observed @xmath38 color . to be precise , we select templates with @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 refers to the uncertainty .",
    "this method works for any two filters , and here we choose @xmath41 .",
    "the selection is inclusive enough to avoid changes in the results : none of the models eliminated from consideration have significant likelihood values .",
    "we check that we would get similar results if we fitted the whole model library .",
    "second , we draw a random set of 1,000 infrared templates from the total set of 50,000 templates .",
    "since our data do not sample the thermal peak , we can not stringently constrain the dust temperature distribution , rendering full exploration of parameter space useless . as a test",
    "we compare the results based on the full and reduced infrared libraries and find no systematic differences ( smaller than 0.01 dex for both stellar mass and sfr ) in the fitting results and no increases or decreases in the formal fitting uncertainties .    in a small number of cases we find that magphys allows the presence of an unrealistically large amount of cold dust . in order to avoid this",
    ", we put a mild constraint on the model 250@xmath18 m luminosity based on the maximum observed 250@xmath18m - to-22@xmath18 m flux ratios @xcite : @xmath42[@xmath43 @xmath44 85.7 @xmath45 [ @xmath43 , which is @xmath146 times the typical ratio .",
    "we will investigate the precision of our predicted total ir luminosities below , in ",
    "[ hatlas ] .    given our 10 flux constraints ( sdss@xmath5 ; w1@xmath464 ; @xmath47 limit ) @xmath48 is calculated for each model in the library .",
    "for each model parameter the posterior probability distribution can be generated by taking the prior probability distribution ( from the full library ) and assign weights @xmath49 to each of the models . in doing",
    "so we marginalize over all other model parameters and assume that the likelihood of a given model given the data is proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "we adopt the 50 percentile value  that is , the median  as the best estimate . in practice ,",
    "in the case of upper limits , we assumed zero flux with the upper limit as the error bar .",
    "rest - frame fluxes are calculated using the observed fluxes and colors .",
    "analogous to @xcite we derive for each redshift @xmath22 bin a linear fit between , on the one hand , observed - frame magnitudes ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) of the templates in the filters straddling the desired rest - frame band , and , on the other hand , the rest - frame magnitude ( @xmath52 ) of the same templates : @xmath52 = @xmath50 + @xmath53 @xmath54 ( @xmath50 @xmath46 @xmath51 ) + @xmath55 .",
    "then , for each galaxy in the sample , we use the observed magnitudes and the values of @xmath53 and @xmath55 to compute its rest - frame magnitudes . we also adopt this technique to calculate rest - frame 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m luminosities .",
    "the basic result of the sed magphys modelling for each object , is a joint pdf for the 16 parameters , which we then characterize by the median and the percentiles of the marginalized distributions .    vs.  @xmath56 distribution for our sdss+wise sample ,",

    "the generally low values of @xmath48 imply that our library of models is sufficiently extensive .",
    "magphys balances the energy absorbed in the uv / optical and the energy released in the ir , such that the inferred total ir luminosity can be expected to be correct if the optical / nir sed is accurate . still , since the wise 12@xmath1 and 22@xmath1 bands do not sample the thermal peak of the dust emission , it is important to test the robustness of the fitting results , in particular the star - formation rates and dust luminosities .",
    "[ hatlas ] herschel - atlas provides pacs and spire photometry over the wavelength range 100 - 500@xmath1 .",
    "these observations sample the total dust emission more directly than wise . for the subsample of 285 galaxies that fall within the 16 square degree footprint of the publicly available part of herschel - atlas @xcite we verify the precision and accuracy of our inferred total ir luminosity .",
    "our sdss+wise - based models succesfully predict of total ir luminosities and star - formation rates from sdss+wise+herschel photometry , as illustrated in figure [ swfig_hatlas ] ) .",
    "even though the marginalized probability distributions for the dust luminosity and star - formation rate are tightened when herschel photometry is added , we find no systematic offset ( 0.00 dex ) between the star - formation rates .",
    "furthermore , the scatter ( 0.19 dex ) is consistent with the formal confidence intervals ( see figure  [ swfig_hatlas_compare ] ) .",

    "this primary sample contains 91.40% of all sdss galaxies at @xmath61 .",
    "our @xmath60 calculation only includes the maximum redshift at which galaxies would be retained in the sample .",
    "no low - redshift limit , related to the sdss bright - magnitude limit , is taken into account . for our purposes of illustrating the distribution of sfr and stellar mass this",
    "does not matter given the large volume , but for individual , low - redshift , high - luminosity galaxies the user should keep in mind that our @xmath60 can not be directly used .",
    "[ catalog ]",
    "stellar masses and sfrs from the mpa - jhu catalogs @xcite are widely used .",
    "the differences between their and our stellar mass estimates are the addition of wise @xmath7 and @xmath8 photometry as tracers of stellar mass , and the updated galactic extinction correction from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the simultaneous fitting of mid - ir photometry provides a fundamentally different constraint on the dust properties of galaxies than optical photometry and emission line ratios .",
    "in addition , dust attenuation laws are also different . in @xcite",
    "the adopted slope for the attenuation curve is -0.7 , following @xcite .",
    "magphys has the same slope for diffuse dust , but a steeper slope ( -1.3 ) for birth clouds . despite these differences , offsets between the two sets of mass estimates",
    "are small and insignificant ( left - hand panel , figure  [ swfig_mc_w ] ) .",
    "the reasons for this are that the same stellar population models and star - formation histories are used and that the impact of the wise photometry is limited due to the relatively large uncertainties on the total flux measurements .",
    "larger differences are seen for the sfr estimates . as opposed to the stellar mass estimates ,",
    "the sfr estimates rely on wholly different tracers in the two cases . selecting star - forming galaxies by their location in the color - color diagram ( figure [ swfig_urz ] )",
    ", we find a median offset across the sample of 0.22 dex and a scatter of @xmath66  dex .",
    "this offset does not depend on mass or redshift , or even on whether the galaxies have significant 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m detections , but strongly varies with sfr ( figure [ swfig_mc_w ] ) : for high - sfr galaxies our values are large compared to @xcite , for low - sfr galaxies our values are small .",
    "the anti - correlation between the changes in @xmath4 and sfr is the result of the underlying anti - correlation between mass to light ratio and ssfr .",
    "another consequence is that our 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m sfr conversions are lower by , respectively , 0.22 dex and 0.10 dex compared to the conversion based on a comparison with the @xcite estimates , as carried out by @xcite .",

    "the mid - ir luminosities of quiescent galaxies do not reflect star formation activity , but rather circumstellar dust and pahs heated by evolved stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even for many galaxies that are star - forming according to our definition  separated in color - color space ( figure [ swfig_urz ] ; sf galaxies : @xmath67 or @xmath68 )  a large fraction of the mid - ir luminosity is not attributed to star formation .",
    "keeping this in mind , we derive the following conversions from mid - ir luminosity to sfr :    @xmath69    and    @xmath70    these relationships are determined by calculating the median values of the sfr in bins of 0.25 dex wide bins in luminosity and performing a linear fit to these median values , weighing by the inverse of the square root of the numer of objects in the bins .",
    "the upward scatter ( 84%-ile minus median ) in sfr is 0.20 dex , while the downward scatter ( median minus 16%-ile ) is 0.60 dex , reflecting non - sf contributions .",
    "the scatter obviously depends on luminosity : above @xmath71 the downward scatter is also 0.30 dex .",
    "the 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m values are 0.13 and 0.04 dex higher than the conversions provided by @xcite , who based their sfrs on galex uv fluxes and the standard spitzer / mips 24@xmath18 m calibration from @xcite .",
    "the relatively good agreement with the @xcite calibrations is encouraging , as their sample consists of 17 well - resolved , nearby galaxies for which measurement uncertainties are minimal .",
    "( in fact , the small difference is consistent with the random variation expected in the average for small sample of 17 objects . )",

    "our 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m sfr conversions are lower by , respectively , 0.22 dex and 0.10 dex compared to @xcite , who use the @xcite sfrs .",
    "part of this offset can be attributed to the systematic differences between our sfr estimates and those of @xcite ( see sec [ c_b04 ] ) .",
    "additional factors are the differences in sample selection and modeling technique .",
    "we select star - forming galaxies on the basis of their optical colors , whereas @xcite select galaxies with large 22@xmath18 m luminosities .",
    "moreover , not all mid - ir radiation traces sf , which is taken into account in our modeling , whereas @xcite simply use total mid - ir luminosity as a sf tracer",

    "the mass limit described in section  [ msfr ] is such that all galaxies on or near the the sf - ing sequence have significant detections at 12@xmath18 m .",
    "the star - forming sequence is shown in orange , where the dashed lines show the 1@xmath40  scatter , as explained in section  [ msfr ] . in order to visualize the sfr bimodality we adopt the 1-@xmath40 upper limits on the sfr for galaxies where the sfr estimate is more uncertain than 0.39 dex .",

    "[ bimodality ] assessing bi - modality in the galaxy population requires a sample that is corrected for completeness and sufficient sensitivity in the star - formation tracer to separate star - forming and passive galaxies .",
    "we compare the magnitude in @xmath33 band with the wise bands at different redshift and find that the mass completeness limit of our sample is set by the sdss @xmath33-band spectroscopic limit for all redshifts : the fraction of galaxies above the mass limit without wise counterparts is less than 1% .",
    "the completeness limit at a given redshift is found by identifying the most massive galaxies with magnitudes near the limit . as such",
    "we find that the mass completeness limit depends on redshift as @xmath73 .",
    "the mass limit is such that actively sf - ing galaxies always have significant 12@xmath18 m detections ; that is , if a galaxy is not detected at 12 @xmath18 m it must be a quiescent galaxy .",
    "in other words , the upper limit on sfr is useful is the sense that it allows us to distinguish between sf - ing and quiescent galaxies . using the mass limit , a galaxy of a given mass",

    "these values are given in table  2 .",
    "[ msfr ] in figure [ swfig_msfr ] we show the sfr-@xmath4 distribution of the 363,774 galaxies above our mass limit and with flag = 1 ( see section [ catalog ] ) .",
    "the sequence of star - forming galaxies ( a.k.a .  the main sequence )  indicated in orange  is quantified by the median in 0.2-wide stellar mass bins .",
    "we fit these median values with a power law and find : @xmath74    we define the scatter in the main sequence as the 84%-50%-ile range , which is 0.39 dex .",
    "the downward scatter ( 50%-16%-ile range ) is larger ( 0.64 dex ) , but this number is difficult to interpret due to the imperfect separation of star - forming and quiescent galaxies .",
    "this uncertainty is not ( only ) due to limited fidelity in our color - color classification , but also due to the natural variation in sf activity .    for comparison ,",
    "when we apply our fitting technique using the @xcite values for stellar masses and sfrs , we find : @xmath75 our fit is slightly steeper , but more importantly , has a 0.2 dex higher intercept at @xmath76 and a larger scatter ( 0.39 dex vs.  0.31 dex ) .",
    "the larger scatter can perhaps be attributed to the more direct measurement of highly obscured star formation when using mid - ir luminosities as a tracer as opposed to the optical emission lines .",
    "we note that the random uncertainties in our sfr estimates ( typically , 0.18 dex ) are much smaller than the scatter , indicating a large intrinsic scatter around the `` main sequence '' relation .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the measurements from @xcite : their typical uncertainty is 0.30 dex  the same as the scatter  implying zero intrinsic scatter .",
    "we conclude that the the star - forming sequence as revealed by the wise photometry is less tight than what is inferred from optical sdss spectra .",
    "the bi - modality seen in figure [ swfig_msfr ] in our inferred sfr-@xmath4 distribution can be directly compared with figure 17 and 24 from @xcite , where the sfrs are inferred from nebular emission lines strengths , and with figure 15 from @xcite , where the sfrs are inferred from uv luminosities .",
    "the color coding used in figure [ swfig_urz ] is based on the separation of star forming and non - star forming galaxies in figure [ swfig_msfr ] : non - star forming galaxies are those that lie below the sequence by 2 times the scatter or more .",
    "this confirms that the two - color diagram is a simple yet very effective tool to separate dusty from passive galaxies .        finally , it is of interest to explore the distribution of sf in relation to traditional tools to probe sf activity across the galaxy population , such as the color - mass diagram , the bpt diagram @xcite , and the h@xmath77-d4000 relation @xcite . in figure [ swfig_mcolor ]",
    "we show the @xmath78 vs.  stellar mass distribution in three different ways : weighed by number density , weighed by sfr density , and weighed by stellar mass density .",
    "the first panel shows the well - known bimodality in the form of a red sequence and a blue cloud .",
    "we have also indicated the intermediate region often called the green valley , which has been argued to contain galaxies that are transitioning from blue to red ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , as most recently shown by @xcite , many galaxies in this region are reddened because of dust ( also see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and not primarily due to a reduced level of sf .",
    "this is illustrated in the second panel , which shows that the galaxies in the green valley region  and not the more numerous , fainter blue galaxies  dominate the total sf budget of the present - day universe . on the other hand , these massive , sf - ing galaxies do not dominate the stellar mass budget , as is shown in the third panel .",
    "the absence of a dominant population of massive , sf - ing galaxies and a general dearth of massive , disk - like galaxies @xcite implies that their sfrs can not be sustained for long @xcite .    in figure [ swfig_d4000hda ]",
    "we show the sfr distribution in the bpt and @xmath79-@xmath80 diagrams in three different mass bins . in the left - hand panels ,",
    "we show the bpt diagram at different stellar mass bins . for the low stellar mass sample ,",
    "most population are star - forming galaxies and most sf activities are also occur in sf region . for higher stellar mass bins , the population moves to composite galaxies and even low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) , but the sf activities still occur between star - forming and composite regions .    in the right - hand panels we see , like @xcite , that the strength of the 4000break , tracing evolved stellar populations ( @xmath81 1 gyr ) , is anti - correlated with @xmath79 , tracing the presence of younger stellar populations ( age @xmath44 1 gyr ) .",
    "not surprisingly , sf mostly occurs in galaxies with generally young populations . for low - mass galaxies",
    "the sf - ing population is representative of the general population , but for high - mass galaxies the sf - ing galaxies represent a tail of outliers , as most galaxies are old and quiescent .",
    "still , high - mass sf - ing galaxies are older than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "this can be interpreted as evidence for an increasingly prominent bulge , while sf activity in the disk is similar to that in the disks of lower - mass galaxies as argued by @xcite .",
    "however , it could also signal a decline in sf activity as suggested by @xcite .    a detailed exploration of the processes that drive sf evolution is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "but we hope that the community will take advantage of the mid - ir based sfr estimates published here to distinguish further between reddening by dust , age , and reduced sf activity .",
    "we revisit the measurement of stellar masses and star - formation rates for the sdss spectroscopic galaxy sample after adding 4-band photometry from wise for the wavelength range @xmath82 m .",
    "we benefit from this wavelength extension by adopting the latest , state - of - the - art sed modeling approach ( magphys * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which includes the self - consistent treatment of dust attenuation and emission and a wide range of star formation histories .",
    "the resulting sfr esimates are mostly based on pah emission and thermal dust radiation , and , therefore , are complementary to the nebular emission line - derived estimates from @xcite . in section [ l12_l22_sfr ]",
    "we provide new calibrations for the conversion of monochromatic 12@xmath18 m and 22@xmath18 m luminosities into sfrs .",
    "the new @xmath4 and sfr estimates show the well - established bi - modality in sf activity .",
    "a first application is the verification of the cruder color - color separation of sf - ing and quiescent galaxies that is often used at higher redshifts .",
    "we confirm that the @xmath83-@xmath84 ( or , alternatively , @xmath85-@xmath56 , as in figure [ swfig_msfr ] ) color - color separation has a 89% success rate in identifying sf - ing and quiescent galaxies .",
    "we also fit the relation between sfr and @xmath4 ( the sf - ing sequence , or sf - ing main sequence ) .",
    "our sequence is slightly steeper than previous studies based on sdss galaxies , and has a higher normalization and scatter .",
    "we attribute these differences to our new sfr estimates that now include dust emission and also to some extent the uncertainty in establishing a purely star - forming sample ( i.e. without contamination from quiescent galaxies ) .",
    "@xmath86 falaxies contribute most to the cosmic sf density , and these typically have optical colors that are in between those of the traditional red squence and blue cloud ( figure [ swfig_mcolor ] ) as a result of dust attenuation , not because of reduced star - formation activity .",
