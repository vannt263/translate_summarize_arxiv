    "[ fig3]b and fig",
    ".  [ fig4]b can be thought of as one zigzag ribbon connected to two others on one side by b - c bonds and on the other by n - c bonds .",
    "these interfaces correspond to structures 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "the effective stiffness at the interface , obtained by fitting the @xmath26 to a quadratic function , shows that the c - n bond is stronger than c - b bond .",
    "this is expected considering that both interactions are mainly covalent and as more electrons are involved in the bonding , the strength of the bond increases .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows how the thermal conductivity of the aforementioned superlattice interfaces behave when the periods , constrained by @xmath12 = @xmath13 , are varied .",
    "the transport coefficients in the parallel direction , however , behave differently , depending on the type of interface .",
    "the superlattice with armchair interface has smaller thermal conductivity compared to the one with zigzag interface in the studied period range .",
    "as the period thickness increases , the stripe structures appear to become less sensitive to interface effects on parallel thermal conductivity for both interfaces approaching  1050 - 1200 @xmath32 .",
    "this is close to the midpoint of the thermal conductivity values of pristine _",
    "h_-bn , 450 @xmath32 , and graphene , 2300 @xmath32 .",
    "this behavior agrees quantitatively with what is expected from treating the striped structure as the combination of two independent nanoribbons .",
    "previously , it was shown that zigzag ribbons have better thermal transport properties than armchair ribbons at small widths because of the latter having higher atomic line density on the edge .",
    "@xcite thicker ribbons have more transport channels and difference in scattering behavior at the edges become less significant .",
    "thus , it is sensible for striped structures combined through zigzag interfaces to have larger transport coefficients in smaller periods .",
    "another apparent observation is that the thermal transport coefficients perpendicular to the different interfaces behave similarly , gradually increasing from 200 - 250 @xmath32 at @xmath33 to 350 - 400 @xmath32 at @xmath34 .",
    "the perpendicular thermal transport is strongly controlled by the lower thermal conductivity component ( _ h_-bn ) and the interface phonon scattering even at a 30  nm thickness .",
    "if one assumes that the periods of the stripes are longer than the phonon mean free path and the boundary resistance is negligible , then @xmath31 of the stripe system of equal periods is bounded by @xmath35 .",
    "for the calculated superlattices this equation give 752.7 @xmath32 .",
    "the actual physics of the simulated systems , on the other hand , will not resemble to the idealized picture .",
    "first , the system has a finite thermal boundary resistance that depends on the acoustic mismatch of the stripes and the intrinsic properties of the boundary .",
    "the effect of boundary structure on @xmath31 is less pronounced when the results from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a ) and b ) compared , and it is almost independent for zigzag and armchair interfaces .",
    "second , some of the systems have period lengths of only few nanometers which is very short compared to the mfp of the relevant phonons .",
    "thermal conductivity perpendicular to the interface increases slowly as the period size grows ; however , the ideal value will not be reached because of the limiting effect of thermal boundary resistance , which will be present even in systems with period sizes longer than the characteristic mfp .",
    "( color online ) the thermal transport coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the two different graphene/_h_-bn interfaces are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the period lengths of both graphene and _ h_-bn are constrained to be equal .",
    "the atomistic details for the calculated structures are given in table  [ table1 ] in appendix.,width=529 ]      using the same interfaces , we remove the constraint of equal size periods and only require the sum of @xmath13 and @xmath12 to be 60 @xmath18 .",
    "we note here that the variation of the period lengths also enables us to see the influence of concentration .",
    "when _ h_-bn has a small concentration ( or a small period ) , the parallel component of thermal transport increases toward the limiting value of graphene as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the perpendicular component does not exceed 700 @xmath32 .",
    "again , the zigzag interfaces have higher parallel thermal transport coefficients ( 35% larger ) than the armchair interfaces in almost all configurations .",
    "when the period of bn is small , the reduction in @xmath31 from the pristine graphene value is mainly due to interfacial phonon scattering ; systems with larger @xmath36 drive @xmath31 toward the pure bn values but are still limited by the influence of interfacial scattering . the effect of atomic bonding at the interface on conduction is most clearly seen when @xmath37=0.05 .",
    "conductivity perpendicular to the boundary in armchair interfaced sample is noticeably higher than zigzag sample .",
    "this is most probably caused by enhanced scattering from alternating types of interface bonding in zigzag boundaries .",

    "the sum of period lengths of graphene and _ h_-bn are constrained to be 60 nm .",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the influence of dot size and concentration on the @xmath0 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we see that larger dot sizes lead to higher thermal transport coefficients . at the lowest bn concentration ( 2% )",
    "the system with the largest dot has a 20% larger transport coefficient than the other sizes .",
    "this could be understood by the fact that larger dots have a smaller boundary to bulk ratio at the same concentration . as more dots are introduced , this interface effect is suppressed and the @xmath0 of all systems converge to 250 @xmath32 at 40% _ h_-bn .",
    "interestingly , this large concentration limit is similar to the perpendicular conductivity of stripe superlattices with periods similar to the diameter of the dots , see fig .",
    "it is likely that at large concentrations the _",
    "h_-bn dots can isotropically limit the thermal transport in the same manner that the stripes limit the transport perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "in addition to ordered bn dots , we have modeled ordered and random distributions of graphene dots in _ h_-bn .",
    "the thermal conductivity values of these systems are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . a decreasing behavior in thermal conductivity is also observed in these systems as the number of graphene dots increases .",
    "it is surprising to see graphene , as the higher @xmath0 component , does not enhance the thermal conductivity of  _ h_-bn .",
    "this can be attributed to the relatively small size of the dots and the large _ h_-bn / graphene interface to area ratio , leading to interfacial phonon scattering events dominating @xmath0 . at the lowest c concentration",
    ", the ordered dot system has higher thermal conductivity than the bulk value of _ h_-bn .",
    "it is not clear whether this is an actual physical phenomena or an averaging problem since the error bars are large enough to include the bulk value . in creating the random dot configurations",
    ", we maintain the mean dot separation similar to the one in the ordered configurations with same concentration .",
    "for each concentration , the initial conditions of the simulations are not only varied by atom velocities but the also the distribution of the dots .",
    "the thermal conductivities of the structures , having ordered and random dots , are not significantly different for the same dot sizes and concentrations ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath31 of striped nanostructures with large periods is limited by the less conductive component , _",
    "the parallel transport , on the other hand , attains a value close to the average of the two components . as the periods of the stripes",
    "are reduced , interface scattering effects become more prevalent with zigzag interfaces resulting in higher @xmath0 than the armchair interfaces . the thermal conductivity of the dot systems can be tailored by both dot diameter and concentration . small dot concentration and large dot diameter leading to larger conductivities",
