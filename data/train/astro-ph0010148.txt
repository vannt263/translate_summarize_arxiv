    "ngc 6946 is amongst the seven more massive galaxies in the local volume ( = lv ) with distances @xmath3 7 mpc ( karachentsev et al .",
    "51% of the population of the lv are within the gravitational influence of these `` oligarchs '' .",
    "each of 7 the giant galaxies , except ngc  6946 , has a lot of dwarf companions : from 79 members around sc galaxies m101 and ngc  5236 to 32 members around giant elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 . in this sense the absence of accompying dwarf systems around ngc  6946 within a radius of @xmath41 mpc ( tully , 1988 ) looked like a remarkable anomaly .",
    "however , the apparent isolation of ngc  6946 may be related with its location on a border of the local void ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "the substantial galactic extinction in the direction of ngc  6946 has also an influence on the visibility of faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "based on copies of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( = poss - ii ) , karachentseva & karachentsev ( 1998 ) undertook a search for galaxies of low surface brightness in the vicinity of normal galaxies in the lv .",
    "observations of these galaxies ( kk- list ) with the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope revealed three dwarf galaxies : ugc  11583 = kk250 , kk251 , and kk252 , with positions and radial velocities close to ngc  6946 ( huchtmeier et al .",

    "( 1999 ) discovered beside ngc  6946 a low surface brightness galaxy with radial velocity @xmath5 km  s@xmath1 named by them cepheus 1 .",
    "subsequent searches for nearby dwarf galaxies by karachentseva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( kkr- list ) and karachentseva et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( kkh- list ) led to the discovery of some more lsb objects around ngc  6946 . in this paper we present results of optical and hi observations of these new objects ,",
    "particularly data on three new probable companions of ngc  6946 .",
    "table 1 lists 18 nearby dwarf galaxy candidates from the above mentioned list with projected distances to ngc  6946 of less than 1 mpc . for the giant galaxy ngc  6946 , also included in the table , a distance of 5.9 mpc ( see sect.4 ) is adopted . besides the galaxy name , and its equatorial and galactic coordinates , table  1 contains : major and minor axes measured on the blue ( j ) poss - ii copy , morphological type determined with with poss - ii copies , surface brightness ( low , very low , extremely low ) , and galactic extinction in the b , and i bands according to schlegel et al.(1998 ) .",
    "the hi line observations showed that objects kkr46 , kkr48 , and kkr58 are background galaxies with heliocentric radial velocities of respectively + 3779 , + 3158 , and + 2756 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "images of the remaining 15 objects from the digital sky survey are reproduced in figure  1 , each field being 5 arcmin wide .",
    "most objects were imaged with the 6-m telescope ( russia ) and the 2.5-m nordic telescope ( spain ) in different filters of the johnson - cousins system .",
    "table  2 presents the observational log with indication of exposure time and seeing .",
    "a 1k@xmath61k ccd detector was used at the 6-m telescope , providing a total view of 3@xmath7 with a resolution of 0@xmath8/pixel .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,>,>,<,<,>,^ \" , ]     emission with parameters : @xmath9 km  s@xmath1 , @xmath10 = 10 km  s@xmath1 , and @xmath11 = 5.6 jy km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the third galaxy , kkr59 , has probably emission with @xmath1217 , @xmath10 = 63 , and @xmath11 = 36 jy km  s@xmath1 adjacent to the local hi emission .",
    "all three hi detections are marginal and have to be confirmed with independent optical / radio observations .",
    "results of our surface photometry of 7 galaxies around ngc  6946 are presented in table  3 .",
    "its columns contain : ( 1 ) galaxy name , ( 2 ) integral apparent magnitude in the @xmath13 band , ( 3 ) integral colour @xmath14 or @xmath15 , ( 4 ) central surface brightness in the @xmath13 band , ( 5 ) exponential scale lenght in arcsec . to estimate the integral blue magnitude of a galaxy we used the transformation @xmath16 , derived by makarova ( 1999 ) for late type galaxies .",
    "when only the integral colour @xmath14 is measured , we used an approximate relation @xmath17 after dereddening .",
    "based on photometry of the brightest stars in the galaxies : kk251 , kk252 , kkr55 , kkr56 , and kkr59 we determine the mean apparent magnitude of the three brightest blue stars , @xmath18 , and use it as an indicator of distance to the galaxies . according to sandage & tammann ( 1974 ) and",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1978 ) the mean luminosity of blue supergiants in a late type galaxy depends on its integral magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "after calibration with cepheids , this relation can be written ( karachentsev & tikhonov , 1994 ) as @xmath20 + 4.14.\\ ] ] in order to obtain b magnitudes from v or r we used the empirical relations : @xmath21 @xmath22 determined via standard landolt s stars with colours @xmath23 .",
    "the derived distance moduli are presented in table  4 , which contains the basic integral parameters of the galaxies . in this table",
    "we incuded also data on cepheus 1 from burton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , as well as data on ngc6946 and kk250 from sharina et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with the corrections for extinction from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this table",
    "the rows indicate the following parameter : ( 1 ) morphological type , ( 2 ) integral galaxy magnitude , ( 3 ) adopted value of extinction ; ( 4 ) integral galaxy colour corrected for extinction ; ( 5,6 ) the mean apparent magnitude and the mean colour of the three brightest blue stars , corected for redening , ( 7,8 ) derived distance modulus and linear distance in mpc ; ( 9 ) absolute magnitude assuming the mean modulus of @xmath24 ; ( 10,11 ) heliocentric velocity and velocity reduced to the local group centroid ; ( 12 ) the hi line width at a 50% level of the maximum ; ( 13 ) the hi line flux ; ( 14 ) hydrogen mass - to - luminosity ratio in solar units ; ( 15,16 ) angular and linear projected separation from ngc  6946 .",
    "in spite of substantial extinction towards the ngc  6946 group and of the indirect estimate of blue magnitudes of member stars , the derived distance moduli of the candidate group members agree satisfactorily . assuming a distance modulus of 28.89 for cepheus 1 ( burton et al .",
    "1999 ) from the luminosity of its hii regions , the mean distance modulus for eight members of the group is 28.86@xmath00.14 with a standard deviation of 0.36 mag , typical for distances using the brightest stars . with a mean distance of 5.9@xmath00.4 mpc ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes of dwarf irregular companions of ngc  6946 lie in a usual range of [ @xmath2513.6 , @xmath2517.5 ] .",
    "probably the group contains also fainter members , but a search for them would be a rather difficult observational task .",
    "besides kk251 , where the estimate of @xmath26 is complicated by a superposition of bright stars , the companions of ngc  6946 have colours typical for irregular galaxies .    adopting the above identifications of hi emission in galaxies , we obtain hydrogen mass - to - luminosity ratios within [ 0.18  3.0 ] @xmath2 , which is also typical for irregular galaxies .",
    "the hydrogen mass is obtained from the hi flux , @xmath11 ( in jy@xmath27 km  s@xmath1 ) , and distance d ( in mpc ) , as    @xmath28 = \\log f + 2\\log d + 5.37.\\ ] ]    the mean square radial velocity of companions with respect to ngc  6946 is 95 km  s@xmath1 , and their mean relative velocity is ( + 8@xmath041 ) km  s@xmath1 .",
    "4 shows the location of seven physical companions of ngc  6946 ( open squares ) in galactic coordinates .",
    "three other galaxies in the same area without radial velocities and distance estimates are indicated with crosses .",
    "the most distant group member , kkr59 , is at 483 kpc from ngc  6946 .",
    "this is approximately the same size as that of the systems of companions we see around other near giant spiral galaxies : m31 , m81 , and m101 .",
    "based on the mean linear separation of dwarf galaxies in the ngc  6946 group , @xmath29 = 210 kpc , and their root mean square radial velocity , 95 km  s@xmath1 , we can estimate a virial mass of the group . in case of randomly orientated closed orbits with a mean orbit eccentricity of @xmath30 = 0.5 the virial ( orbital ) mass is 1.6@xmath31 .",
    "since the integral blue luminosity of the group is @xmath32 , it yields a virial mass - to- luminosity ratio @xmath33 , typical for small galaxy groups like the local group .",
    "being located at a low galactic latitude , @xmath34 , in a zone of substantial extinction , ngc  6946 looks at first glance like an isolated giant spiral galaxy on the border of the local void ( tully , 1988 ) .",
    "recent searches for low surface brightness galaxies on the poss - ii films revealed about a dozen probable companions to ngc  6946 .",
    "subsequent hi observations of the candidates and distance estimates from the brightest stars showed that at least 7 dwarf irregular galaxies can be considered as physical companions of ngc  6946 .",
    "therefore , a new nearby group of galaxies has been discovered at a distance of ( 5.9@xmath00.4 ) mpc .",
    "the mean projected diameter of the group is 420 kpc , its root mean square radial velocity is 95 km  s@xmath1 , and the virial mass - to - luminosity ratio is @xmath33 , typical for small galaxy groups .",
    "the two nearby giant face - on sc galaxies : m101 and ngc  6946 , and their dwarfs are alike with respect to their structure and kinematics . being gas - rich galaxies , the members of the ngc 6946 group need to be studied in more detail with radio hi synthesis interferometry .",
