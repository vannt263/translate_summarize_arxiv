    "throughout the past few years , much effort had been made on classification and realization of symmetry protected topological phases ( spt)@xcite . even the spt states themselves are short range entangled , the surface state of spt phase can exhibit topological order in an anomalous way@xcite .",

    "the blossom of spt states provides a rich platform to study the interplay between geometry and topological degree of freedom . in 2d chern insulator coupled to gravity , there exists a gravitational chern - simons response as a consequence of thermal hall conductance@xcite ; in 3d time reversal invariant topological insulator / superconductor coupled to gravity , one expects a gravitational @xmath7 term as a signature of gravitational witten effect and gravitoelectromagnetism @xcite . beyond these exotic gravitational responses ,",

    "however , on the surface , the end point of disclination loop(which is a disclination point ) might have nontrivial braiding statistics which forbids itself from proliferation .    in this part ,",

    "the spatial dependent superfluid order is sensitive to dislocation defect and we observe interesting intertwined topological order between dislocation and superfluid vortex .      before we go into the detail of our result , we briefly review the theory developed by several pioneers@xcite where they obtained a surface topological order of 3d tsc without @xmath0 breaking . as the topological liquid crystal we obtained in section [ tlc ]",
    "is inherited from 8 copies of 3d tsc with strong interaction , we then have 8 copies of majorana cone on the surface .",
    "one can always combine every two majorana cone into a dirac cone , then the surface theory is equivalent to 4 gapless dirac theory , @xmath57 different from the dirac theory in 2d , the fermion here is unusual under @xmath0 transformation .",
    "the @xmath0 operator acts on both the spin and the particle - hole channel .",
    "now assume we gap the surface dirac cones by turning on s - wave pairing of each cone .",
    "the condensation of cooper pair @xmath58 leads to a new superfluid term in the hamiltonian , @xmath59 the time reversal operation turns a superfluid creation operator into an annihilation operator .",
    "the superfluid order parameter breaks @xmath0 but still invariant under the combination of time reversal and particle - hole @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the vortex of the superfluid field is still a vortex under time reversal operation .",
    "once we condense the vortex of the superfluid order , we would restore the @xmath0 symmetry@xcite . if we write the superfluid surface state back in the majorana basis",

    "the fermion on the surface is confined by the disclination and the surface topological order is the @xmath1 $ ] state .      in this section , we move to another condition where the surface disclination is energetically unfavored and therefore confined but the dislocation is deconfined . in crystalline phases ,",
    "a dislocation can be fused by a pair of disclination dipole with opposite charge .",
    "the two disclinations of opposite charge have attractive interaction at 2d and thus being confined as a bound state of disclination dipole at low temperature .",
    "when the temperature goes up , the disclination is deconfined and proliferated which give rise to an isotropic liquid by lattice melting(which is the situation we studied in section  [ rotaionsymmetry ] ) . a pair of disclination dipole forms a dislocation in the crystal phase .",
    "by proliferating such dislocations , the translation symmetry is restored and the system goes into a nematic surface state .",

    "our goal is to study the @xmath0 and translation invariant surface state of the topological liquid crystal . in order to restore the symmetry , we need to condense the superfluid vortex and",

    "the term ` soft lattice ' refers to a spatial dependent order parameter formed by electrons or quasiparticles(@xmath11 the ff superfluid order ) rather than the classical ionic lattices .",
    "ergo , the dislocation of the soft lattice is the defect of the spatial dependent order parameter and the condensation of the dislocation can be approached in terms of ginzburg - landau type theory akin to the vortex condensate in superfluid - mott transitions .",
    "however , due to the topological nature of the surface state , the vortex and dislocation of the ff order parameter might carry majorana zero mode and convey fractional braiding statistics .",
    "we have to investigate the character of the symmetry defect carefully before we condensed them . in the next paragraphs",

    "the @xmath10 winding of the @xmath69 field traps majorana zero mode for every 2 copies of the tsc surface state .",
    "since we have 8 copy of the tsc surface state , we have in total 4 majorana zeros modes trapped inside the @xmath10 dislocation .",

    "has u(1 ) gauge symmetry and the complex fermion current therefore couples with the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath28 .",

    "the @xmath8 gauge flux is confined inside the dislocation on the top surface(superfluid state ) and leaks down to the bulk and the bottom surface .",
    "now imagine the top surface is in the ff superfluid state while the bottom surface breaks time reversal as in section [ tbroken ] .",
    "since the domain wall between the superfluid state and @xmath0 broken state has central charge @xmath75 , the whole slab can be regarded as 4 copies of 2d @xmath76 superconductor .",

    "if we fuse this semion with a bogoliubov quasiparticle , we obtain the @xmath20 particle which is also a semion and meanwhile @xmath19 and @xmath20 are mutually bosons .",
    "the flux trapped by the dislocation is a two semion theory @xmath77 .",
    "as the bulk of the slab itself does not have any topological order , we only need to consider the anyon theory in the top and bottom surface and the sum of them should be equivalent to the @xmath78 theory@xcite .",
    "the bottom surface has four copies of massive dirac cone which breaks @xmath0 .",

    "now we have in total 4 types of topological quasiparticle @xmath81,@xmath82 and @xmath83,@xmath84 and it is essential to figure out their mutual statistics . following the same slab argument we did in section [ rotaionsymmetry ] , both a vortex of the superfluid and a @xmath10 dislocation in the ff wave vector traps @xmath8 flux penetrating along the slab .",

    "the auxiliary gauge field @xmath28 reveals the self and mutual braiding statistics we obtained in the previous paragraph .",
    "earlier work had pointed out @xcite that the geometry response in 3d @xmath0 tsc only shows a @xmath15 class , which is weaker than the integer classification of the non - interacting system or the @xmath9 class at the interacting level .",
    "it was suspected that the geometry response can not fully capture or identify different class of phase in 3d tsc .",
    "however , based on our conclusion in section [ dislocationtheory ] , the ff superfluid order on the surface intertwines the dislocation with the superfluid vortex and condensation of these two types of defect give rise to new topological order .",
    "depending on the number of copies we have for tsc , the dislocations exhibit different braiding statistics at the surface and this provides us a new way to identified different spt phases from geometry degree of freedom .",

    "@xmath95 @xmath96 is the is the volume of @xmath97 .",
    "the o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with @xmath94 is critical when we have the exact o(4 ) symmetry .",
    "but once we break the symmetry to @xmath13(with respect to the o(2 ) rotor for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , the theory is gapped and topological ordered .",
    "imagine we have a vortex @xmath100 between @xmath98 and vortex @xmath101 between @xmath99 , the @xmath5 term shows that these two vortices have mutual semion statistics , which agrees with the vortex condensation argument .",

    "now we define @xmath109 . integrating out the fermion leads to , @xmath110 the vortex @xmath100 and dislocation @xmath111 has mutual semion statistics with @xmath101 and @xmath112 .",

    ", either a vortex or a @xmath10 dislocation of @xmath108 would trap 4 majorana zero mode on the surface . following the similar argument as you @xmath56@xcite , the dislocation carries a kramers doublet .",
    "to restore the translation symmetry of the surface without gap closing , one needs to condense at least double dislocation to get rid of the redundant zero modes . after double dislocation condensation , the surface state is in a nematic phase with @xmath15 topological order where two dislocation with burgers vector in perpendicular direction has mutual semion statistics .    here , it is essential to point out that the fermion bilinears coupled with @xmath98 in eq .",

    "meanwhile , the vortex of @xmath101 who has mutual semion statistics is actually the @xmath116 in section [ doubleetmt ] .    to conclude , in this section",
    ", we retest the surface topological order of the topological liquid crystal inherited from 8 copies of 3d tsc via the nl@xmath3 m argument . by dressing the rotor vector with a spiral order",
    ", we obtained a consistent topological nematic surface as we did in section [ dislocationtheory ] .",
    "motivated by the result in section [ sssec : nlsm ] , we first look into the interplay between crystalline defect(dislocation ) and symmetry flux in a 2d spt whose low energy theory is inherited from nl@xmath3 m with topological @xmath5 term . the topological @xmath5 term in nl@xmath3 m provides a straightforward way to classify and characterize boson spt in 2d@xcite .",
    "the gapless(or symmetry breaking ) edge state of the spt is encoded in the @xmath5 term who reduced to a wess - zumino - witten term on the edge .",
    "in addition , after symmetry gauging , the nontrivial braiding statistics of the symmetry flux can also be verified via the @xmath5 term .    to obtain a topological nl@xmath3 m with @xmath5 term ,",
    "we start with 4 copies of @xmath117 superconductor and couple the fermions with an o(4 ) vector , whose effective coupling can be simplified as@xcite ,    @xmath118    [ 2dtheta ]    this theory can be viewed as a descendant of eq . which describes the surface theory of 3d tsc .",
    "if we reduce the o(5 ) vector to o(4 ) in eq . by assigning a nonzero expectation value for @xmath119 , then eq . becomes equivalent to the theory we are investigating here . in the o(4 ) disordered phase , the effective theory is a boson nl@xmath3 m at @xmath12@xcite .",
    "@xmath120    if the fermion gap is large , the fermion degree of freedom is absent at low energy spectrum so the system can be regarded as a pure boson spt@xcite .",
    "dress each o(2 ) rotor with spiral order as we did in section [ sssec : nlsm ] , @xmath121    the @xmath108 rotors are dressed with a spiral order which enable the rotor to oscillate along @xmath105 direction . after integrating out the fermion ,",
    "one obtains a 2d boson spt state described by o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with topological @xmath5 term protected by @xmath122 symmetry . the theta term of the o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with spiral order is , @xmath123 the theory itself is an spt state so there is no anyonic statistics .",
    "however , it was pointed out @xcite that if we gauge the symmetry of spt phase , the gauge flux can exhibit topological order .",
    "if we gauge the @xmath122 symmetry and couple the theory with the vision excitation carrying a @xmath8 flux , the vison line of @xmath124(@xmath125 ) is bound with a @xmath8 dislocation for @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) or half vortex of @xmath100(@xmath101 ) . according to the topological theta term in eq .",
    ", the vison braiding procedure is equivalent to braiding a half - dislocation of @xmath111(or half vortex of @xmath100 ) with a half - dislocation of @xmath112(or half vortex of @xmath101 ) .",
    "the braiding process finally gives @xmath126 berry phase , indicates the nontrivial braiding statistics between the half dislocation / vortex .",
    "to summarize , if we decorated the rotors in the 2d boson spt with spiral order and gauge the @xmath122 symmetry , the dislocation and the gauge flux show intertwined topological ordered .",
    "if we further break the symmetry from @xmath122 to a global @xmath15 where @xmath127 under the @xmath15 symmetry transformation , the vison of the @xmath15 gauge field is a bound state between the two vision for @xmath128 .",
    "the braiding between two vision becomes the self - rotation of the bound state . since the berry phase accumulated by the self - rotation is @xmath126 , the two half - dislocations bounded with the vison is a self - semion .      based on the study in section  [ bspt ] , the 2d spt described by an o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with spiral order can exhibit exotic braiding statistics between the dislocation and gauge flux .",
    "it is well known that an o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with topological theta term for @xmath12 is equivalent to the levin - gu model if we take the ising limit of o(4 ) vector@xcite .",
    "the original o(4 ) vector can be reduced to @xmath129 as @xmath130 and assume system energetically favors vector @xmath131 over @xmath72 , the wave function can be therefore written as , @xmath132 the wave function runs over a coherent state of all superposition of @xmath133 configuration and each configuration is dressed with a sign structure depending on the skyrmion number(@xmath134 ) in the configuration .",
    "now assume we further break o(3 ) down to @xmath15 by energetically favor @xmath135 over other component .",
    "then the skyrmion number reduced to the domain wall number(@xmath136 ) of @xmath135 and the wave function reduced to , @xmath137 which is exactly the levin - gu wave function@xcite .    in our previous discussion",
    ", it turns out that the o(4 ) nl@xmath3 m with spiral order decoration exhibit nontrivial braiding statistics between flux and dislocation after we gauge the symmetry .",
    "when we break the o(4 ) symmetry of this model to @xmath15 limit and gauge the @xmath15 symmetry , the flux exhibit semion / antisemion statistics which is studied by several early pioneers@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we decorate the levin - gu model with a stripe modulation .",
    "such decoration , similar to what we did in section [ bspt ] , intertwines the spatial translation defect(dislocation ) with the @xmath15 flux .",
    "it turns out that after we gauge the symmetry , the dislocation and the @xmath15 flux have semion / antisemion statistics .",
    "varies in space , depending on whether the bond lives on the even / odd stripe on the lattice .",
    "all the blue bonds have plus sign while the red bonds have minus sign for @xmath138 . , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to start with , we would decorate the levin - gu model with a stripy modulation , which enables the reciprocation between dislocation and symmetry flux .",
    "the stripy levin - gu model coupled with @xmath15 gauge flux is , @xmath139    the @xmath3 operator acting on the ising spin variable lying on the site of the triangle lattice .",
    "the @xmath36 operator is the @xmath15 gauge flux lying on the bond connecting nearest sites .",
    "@xmath140 term ensures the ground state(gs ) is flux free and @xmath141 is the minimal coupling between ising variable and @xmath15 gauge flux .",
    "different from the original levin - gu model , the @xmath15 charge carried by the ising variable is spatial dependent due to the stripe modulation of our model . as a result ,",
    "the sign before @xmath138 varies in space , depending on whether the bond lives on the even / odd stripe on the lattice .",
    "the horizontal bond is always negative .",
    "the sign structure is displayed in fig.[lg ] , all the blue bonds have plus sign while the red bonds have minus sign for @xmath138 .",
    "the gs wave function of this stripy modulation levin - gu model is still a superposition of the all domain wall configurations ( for the ising sector)where each domain wall configuration has a sign in the front depending on the number of domain walls .",
    "for the @xmath15 gauge sector , all the flux in the triangle should be flux free so the gauge choice can be @xmath142 for gauge field on the red bond while @xmath143 for gauge field on the blue bond .",
    "thus , we write the wave function as ,    @xmath144 refers to different ising spin configuration .",
    "now , we consider the spatial modulation levin - gu model on the triangle lattice in the presence of dislocation .",
    "the hamiltonian remains the same and the sign in front of @xmath138 depends on the location of the bond , which is illustrated by color in fig.[lgd ] as a dislocation lattice .",
    "all the terms in the hamiltonian still commute each other .",
    "however , if we still choose the gauge sector according to the bond color in eq . , the triangle with blue bond near the dislocation point carries a flux which can not be gauge away locally . to get the gs wave function",
    ", we need to eliminate the flux .",
    "the gs wave function of this stripy levin - gu model with dislocation is ,    @xmath145    here @xmath146 is a flux generating operator starting from the triangle near the dislocation as is illustrated in fig.[lgd ] .",
    "the @xmath146 operator creates / annihilates a @xmath15 flux at the end of the string . in this way",
    ", the flux carried by the dislocation is therefore annihilated by the flux string .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite that due to the commutation relation between string operator @xmath147 , braiding procedure between two gauge flux gives a minus sign . as is explicit from the ground state wave function , in the presence of dislocation in eq .",
    ", a dislocation is accompanied with a string operator creating @xmath15 flux in the dislocation point .",
    "winding a flux line along the dislocation would attribute a @xmath8 berry phase , the same berry phase also appears when we braiding two dislocations .",
    "therefore , the dislocation is a self - semion and it has semion statistics with the gauge flux .",
    "this agrees with our field theory result in eq ..",
    "in this paper we studied the novel properties of geometry defects in spt phases .",
    "we argue that the condensation of disclination in 8 copies of 3d @xmath0 tsc would confine the fermion and afterward turn the system into a 3d boson topological liquid crystal(tcl ) , whose bulk is sre but the surface displays topological order .",
    "in addition , we investigate the interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the surface of tcl via ff surface superfluid order .",
    "it turns out that after condensation of double superfluid vortex and double dislocation , we obtain a @xmath0 and translation invariant surface topological order , a double @xmath1 $ ] state , which can not be realized in pure 2d system .",
    "we also look into the dislocation theory in 2d boson spt described by the @xmath2 nl@xmath6 with a @xmath5 term(when @xmath12 ) .",
    "after we dress the @xmath2 vector with some spiral order and gauge the symmetry , the dislocation has nontrivial braiding statistics with the gauge flux . further reduced the @xmath2 vector to ising limit , we arrive at the levin - gu model with stripy modulation .",
