    "since their inception , optical forces have become an invaluable tool in atomic and molecular physics , playing a dominant role in the preparation and study of ultracold neutral species .",
    "these forces can be divided into two main categories , spontaneous and stimulated .",
    "as the names imply , spontaneous optical forces rely on spontaneous decay of a system to accomplish momentum transfer , while stimulated forces make use of the surrounding light field to drive both absorption and emission .",
    "stimulated forces have the advantage of allowing much greater forces at the cost of more complex optical configurations .",
    "previous experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of stimulated forces , which rely on coherent momentum transfer between a system ( e.g. an atom ) and the light field .",
    "grimm and coworkers made use of rectified optical dipole forces to deflect an atomic cs beam by several m / s  @xcite , later improving on this result by developing the much stronger optical bichromatic force ( bcf ) and using it to decelerate the atoms nearly to rest @xcite .",
    "the basic principles of the bcf , which utilizes two - color beams with symmetric detunings @xmath0 from resonance , are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bcf ] below .",
    "further work by metcalf expanded on this idea by using bichromatic forces to focus and decelerate an atomic beam of metastable helium ( he * ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , our group has designed and evaluated two schemes for longitudinal slowing of a beam of metastable helium by several hundred m / s  @xcite . in one approach ,",
    "an amplified laser was used at a large detuning from resonance to extend the velocity range over which the force is effective , but it became clear that a complicated high - power multi - stage design would be needed . in the other , deceleration by nearly 400 m / s was achieved using two ordinary diode lasers in a chirped bichromatic slowing configuration that compensated the changing doppler shifts . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , an upgraded version using slightly larger laser detuning and higher power is predicted to slow he * to velocities suitable for mot loading .",
    "enhanced mot loading using bcf slowing has already been demonstrated for atomic rb , for which doppler shifts are of much less concern @xcite .",
    "the most important limits constraining the bichromatic force are the magnitude of the force , the velocity range , and the excited - state fraction .",
    "though it might seem counter - intuitive , the magnitude of the force is perhaps the least important of these , simply because it is so large . under typical bcf conditions",
    "the stopping distance for a typical atomic beam would be on the order of 1 cm if a constant force could be maintained . instead ,",
    "the attainable velocity reduction is usually limited either by the velocity range of the force or by losses unrelated to the bcf cycle itself , a particular concern if the bcf is to be applied to molecular systems  @xcite . for molecules ,",
    "there is a strong motivation to reduce the excited - state fraction in order to reduce radiative losses into  dark \" states with the wrong vibrational or rotational quantum number .",
    "these losses effectively terminate the bcf cycle and thereby limit the time interval available for deceleration .    in this paper",
    "we describe detailed numerical calculations for a two - level atom or molecule subjected to bichromatic or polychromatic laser beams in the bcf configuration  a pair of counterpropagating multicolor beams with an adjustable phase shift .",
    "the forces and ensemble behavior due to stimulated optical forces are calculated by direct numerical solution of the optical bloch equations ( obes ) .",
    "we pay particular attention to the time evolution of atomic excitation , which has not previously been investigated in a way that allows systematic examination .",
    "we also carefully investigate the robustness of bichromatic and polychromatic forces against imbalances in intensity between counterpropagating beams .",
    "insensitivity to beam imbalance is vital for successful experimental realizations because an intensity balance of less than 5 - 10% is very difficult to attain over an extended area .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the conventional two - color bichromatic force , with an emphasis on factors that define its limits as a practical slowing mechanism .",
    "an unusual  bloch cylinder \" plot is introduced to graphically visualize some of the more obscure aspects of bichromatic forces .",
    "we then discuss a proposed extension to multicolor or polychromatic forces ( pcfs ) , and more specifically to a four - color stimulated force .",
    "heuristic arguments based on pulse areas suggest that additional rf sidebands at @xmath1 should reduce the excited - state fraction while maintaining a large optical force , and this prediction is verified by the actual modeled behavior .",
    "we show that for an increase of just 33% in the total laser power , large improvements can be obtained not only in the excited - state fraction , but also in the magnitude and velocity range of the force .",
    "the projected improvements are sufficiently large to make the four - color scheme attractive both for molecules and for atomic beam deceleration",
    ". we also briefly discuss considerations that arise in the many - color limit of a continuous train of short pulses .",
    "as the name suggests , the bichromatic force is a particular realization of a two - color stimulated optical force , first proposed in the late 1980s by voitsekhovich , _ et al . _",
    "it uses counterpropagating pairs of two - color laser beams to stimulate excitation and emission in an ensemble of atoms or molecules . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_concept ] , each beam has components detuned by rf frequencies @xmath2 from resonance .",
    "these near - resonant beams interfere to form beat notes with a period @xmath3 as illustrated . because the full period of the beat note envelope is actually @xmath4 , there are phase reversals between adjacent pulses , which will play an important role in our discussion of the robustness of bichromatic and polychromatic forces",

    "a doppler offset of @xmath6 may be necessary to bring the system within the velocity range of the force . ]",
    "the intensity of the beat notes is adjusted such that each  pulse \" of duration @xmath3 has an area of approximately @xmath5 in units normalized to the rabi frequency @xcite . in a simplified model of the bcf",
    "usually called the @xmath5-pulse model , the pulses from the right and the left are regarded as if they were non - overlapping short pulses , so that an atom at the center experiences alternating @xmath5-pulses that cause a repeating cycle of excitation from the right followed by stimulated emission from the left .",
    "each excitation or stimulated decay produces a momentum change @xmath7 , at a rate @xmath8 set by the beat frequency .",
    "this will continue until radiative decay randomly resets the atom into the ground state . by adjusting the phase between the counterpropagating beat - note trains from the right and the left",
    ", one can control the probability that radiative decay will restart the system in the correct right - left sequence , thereby controlling the average direction of the applied force .",
    "the maximum decelerating force on an ensemble of atoms occurs when the phase shift between beats corresponds to half of a beat note or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the phase of the electric field envelope .",
    "this optimal phasing yields a time - averaged bichromatic force on each atom of @xmath11 these results for the force and the optimal phasing remain valid in more accurate treatments using doubly - dressed atoms or numerical methods , although the optimal pulse area for each beat note increases to @xmath12 when the overlapping beats are fully taken into account @xcite .",
    "the optimization of these parameters is explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , together with discussions of the sensitivity the bcf to deviations from the optimal values . however , the effects of imbalanced intensities between counterpropagating beam pairs have not been well - understood , and we address this topic below .      to systematically study the evolution of an ensemble over time , both for the bcf and its polychromatic generalizations , the obes for a two - level atom are solved in the rotating - wave approximation for a multi - color light field .",

    "deceleration parameters of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ]",
    "the most striking feature is a clear deviation from the simplified model of alternating @xmath5-pulses that act in pairs to cycle the atomic excitation . rather than simply oscillating between the poles of the bloch sphere ( as is suggested by the @xmath5-pulse model ) , the bloch vector initially rotates counterclockwise through nearly @xmath49 in response to an initial pair of beat notes , then reverses direction and follows a similar trajectory backwards .",
    "the additional wrapping of the bloch vector is symmetric about the ground state of the system , but these excursions illustrate an increase in the excited - state fraction for the ensemble as compared to an idealized short - pulse sequence .",
    "the overall four - pulse periodicity , which has apparently not previously been noted , stems from the phase reversal between successive pulses in the beat - note trains , as indicated by the ( + ) and (  ) signs in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_concept ] .",
    "this causes the corresponding rabi frequencies to alternate in sign , or equivalently the pulse areas can be said to alternate between positive and negative values .",
    "as we discuss below , the full reversal of the bloch vector evolution after four pulses helps to explain why the bcf is highly robust in the presence of imbalanced beam intensities , both in numerical calculations and in laboratory experiments .",
    "in addition to modeling the ensemble behavior , solving the obes for atoms with fixed non - zero velocities allows us to calculate a force profile for the bcf as a function of velocity . as in previous work @xcite ,",
    "the force is calculated at each velocity by use of ehrenfest s theorem .",
    "the force profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_force ] exhibit the familiar features of the bcf : the force is proportional to the detuning , and so is the velocity range over which it is effective .",
    "the horizontal axis is in scaled units of @xmath50 , which for the example of he * corresponds to units of 1.755 m / s , and the vertical axis is in units of the saturated radiative force from a monochromatic beam , @xmath51 . because the stimulated cycling rate depends on @xmath52 rather than @xmath14 , the magnitude of the bichromatic force is typically far in excess of the radiative force , by a factor of about @xmath53 .",
    "the numerous narrow spikes in fig . [ fig : bcf_force ] are not numerical noise , but higher - order resonances somewhat related to  doppleron \" resonances  @xcite .",
    "they are typically unobservable under experimental conditions due to decoherence and deviations from pure two - level behavior .    , using optimal values for @xmath10 and @xmath54 as in fig .",

    "the many sharp spikes are multiphoton resonances and are typically unobservable ( see text ) . ]    from calculations like those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_force ] , the magnitude of the force is found to be in agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : f_bich ] , and the full width of the velocity profile ( including negative velocities ) can be estimated to be  @xcite @xmath56 so long as the beat notes have the optimal pulse area , the force will increase in proportion to an increasing bichromatic detuning @xmath52 .",
    "however , to maintain the required pulse area the rabi frequency must also be increased proportionally to @xmath52 , so the required laser intensity increases quadratically .",
    "more specifically , the required intensity in each detuned component beam is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is linear in @xmath52 ( e.g. @xmath48 in the case of ideal bcf ) thereby making very large detunings impractical .    , but there is still no accumulating offset of the bloch vector phase . ]",
    "we have previously found that as the detuning increases there is increased sensitivity to imbalanced beam intensities  @xcite .",
    "however , numerical modeling showed much less sensitivity than a simple estimate based on the @xmath5-pulse model using pulse pairs , and we also noted that the simple estimate appeared to overstate the sensitivity by a factor of two for the only case in which direct comparison with experiment is possible  @xcite .",
    "( same as upper trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_force ] ) bottom : velocity profile for a left - right intensity imbalance of 25% . ]    much of this can be explained by examining the bloch cylinder plots for calculations using imbalanced beams . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_ensembleimb ] , the bloch vector trajectory is plotted for a left - right intensity imbalance of 25% , where imbalance is defined as @xmath59 . in the simplified @xmath5-pulse model",
    "there would be a shift in the angle of the bloch vector after each pulse pair , resulting in a cumulative error that would reverse the sign of the force after several cycles .",
    "instead we see that the bloch vector continues to execute a repetitive cycle , since a complete group of four pulses still has a total pulse area of zero .",
    "however , the center of symmetry is slightly shifted away from the ground state , as evidenced by the asymmetric locations of the turning points in the figure .",
    "this slightly increases the excited state fraction , but more importantly , it greatly affects the force profile . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_imbforcevsvelocity ] , the average force is reduced by about a factor of about three under these conditions . a more complete picture of the force reduction force can be gained from fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_forcevsimb ] , where the relative force as a function of intensity imbalance is shown for several values of the bichromatic detuning . for large imbalances at large detunings , examination of the force profiles reveals that they are increasingly dominated by the  hash \" of very narrow multiphoton resonances .",
    "because the presence of these resonances relies on a high level of coherence in a pure two - level system , the calculations in this range are expected to overestimate the force that could be realized in actual experimental conditions .",
    "is increased from 125@xmath14 to 500@xmath14 . ]      as mentioned previously , the excited - state fraction is of particular interest because it determines the ensemble - averaged radiative decay rate . for molecular systems a small fraction of radiative decays will unavoidably  leak \" to dark states from which further cycling can not occur , so the time interval during which the bcf can decelerate molecules is inversely proportional to the excited - state fraction  @xcite . if this fraction can be reduced while keeping the magnitude of the force constant , the velocity change attainable in a decelerator will increase correspondingly .",
    "this fraction can easily be calculated from the time evolution of the bloch vector . unlike the results discussed so far , it is important to include the effects of radiative damping by integrating eqs .",
    "[ eq : obes ] over a sufficiently large time interval , @xmath60 . for bcf deceleration under optimal conditions ,",
    "the calculated excited - state fraction is 41% , independent of the detuning @xmath52 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the value of nearly 50% for the ordinary radiative force on a two - level system , because the radiative force normally involves strongly saturated near - resonant excitation while the bcf utilizes large detunings .",
    "it is also interesting to compare this result with the value predicted by careful application of the isolated @xmath5-pulse model .",
    "assuming an optimal left - vs .- right phase @xmath9 , and that the atom is cycling in the correct sequence to produce deceleration as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_concept ] , the atom spends 1/4 of its time in the excited state .",
    "but once it radiatively decays during one of these excited - state intervals , the cycle is reversed and the atom spends 3/4 of its time in the excited state until it again decays , resuming the original cycling .",
    "the reversed cycle is short - lived compared to the correct one because of its large excited - state fraction . taking a properly weighted average over these cycling conditions , the estimated excited - state fraction is 37.5% , which is remarkably close to the exact value of 41% calculated numerically for actual bcf conditions .",
    "the @xmath5-pulse perspective suggests that if beat - note pulse pairs from the left and the right could be moved closer together without disrupting the cycling , a reduced excited - state fraction would result .",
    "it was this idea that initially motivated us to consider a polychromatic variation in which additional rf sidebands at @xmath61 are introduced to produce a shorter - duration beat note pulse , allowing closer pulse proximity without excessive overlap .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , a reduction of the excited - state fraction requires a reduction in the time between excitation and de - excitation pulses , which requires the production of narrower , better - separated pulses .",
    "this can be done by adding additional rf sidebands to the bichromatic beam , allowing a measure of control over the pulse shape and the timing of sequential pulses .",
    "our hope was that this could allow not only a reduction in the left - right phase offset @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ eq : rabipcf ] , but also an opportunity to use the new adjustable parameters to optimize the characteristics of the stimulated force , in a simple version of coherent control .      in principle , a train of delta - function pulses could be produced by adding an infinite number of odd harmonics of the detuning @xmath0 .",
    "we thus started our investigations by adding symmetric components at @xmath62 , although we have subsequently also briefly studied the effects of adding additional components at @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "one might expect that these new third - harmonic components should be added in phase with the fundamental components at @xmath52 and with the same amplitude , since this corresponds to the lowest - order approximation to a delta function .",
    "however , this requires systematic confirmation .",
    "it is not trivial to optimize the stimulated force with these additions , because the phase shift @xmath10 and the rabi frequencies @xmath58 must be re - optimized each time a change is made .    numerically solving the optical bloch equations over a coarse parameter space spanning pulse phases @xmath65 $ ] and rabi frequencies",
    "@xmath66 $ ] ( where @xmath52 is again the principal rf detuning ) yielded an excitation fraction minima in the region of @xmath67=@xmath68=@xmath52 and @xmath69 .",
    "the force was then calculated with finer granularity in this region .",
    "the qualitatively best compromise between force width , force magnitude , and excited state fraction was determined to lie at @xmath67=@xmath68=@xmath52 and @xmath70 with an average excited state fraction of @xmath71 .",
    "this is a 41% reduction compared to the ordinary bcf .",
    "we can also compare this to the predictions of the isolated @xmath5-pulse model .",
    "using the same argument as in section [ subsec : bcf_excfrac ] with a phase of @xmath72 , the predicted excited - state fraction is @xmath73 .",
    "this is again very close to the numerical calculation , but unlike the bichromatic case the numerical value is actually slightly better than the @xmath5-pulse estimate .",
    "the reasons for the large improvement in excited - state fraction are evident when we examine the ensemble evolution for the four - color force in a rabi cylinder plot , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcf_ensemble ] .    -pulse model than the bichromatic case , with the notable exception that the overall periodicity still involves four pulses , not two .",
    "the excited state character of the system is greatly reduced compared to the bcf case in fig . [",
    "fig : bcf_ensemble ] .",
    "this plot was computed for a fundamental detuning of @xmath74 and deceleration parameters of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ]",
    "as expected , the four - color field generates ensemble behavior more closely resembling that of a pair of separated @xmath5-pulses than the bichromatic case in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_ensemble ] .",
    "in particular , there are two key differences .",
    "first , the trajectory wobbles much less around the ground state during the low - intensity portions of the cycle .",
    "this of course translates to significantly less excited - state character in the system .",
    "second , we note that successive points on the trajectory plots are separated by equal - sized time steps",
    ". hence one can extract qualitative information on the velocity of the bloch vector .",
    "comparing with the bichromatic ensemble behavior , the four - color force moves much more quickly through the excited state ( sparse dots ) than its two - color counterpart , and then much more slowly as it lingers near the ground state ( dense dots ) .",
    "these considerations also reduce the excited - state fraction relative to the bcf .     of the laser power that it would require . ]",
    "the four - color force also offers a much - improved velocity range , as well as a significantly increased magnitude . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcf_force ] , the maximum force magnitude in the 4-color case is increased by roughly @xmath77 over the bichromatic force .",
    "this increase is notable , but not too surprising given the 33% increase in total laser power required to generate the four - color pulse trains .",
    "the more remarkable feature of the four - color force is its extremely wide velocity range , increased by nearly a factor of three relative to the bcf . in figure 8 ,",
    "the @xmath78-detuned four - color force is able to achieve the static range of the @xmath79-detuned bichromatic force at roughly 15% of the total laser power that the bcf would require .",
    "polychromatic forces are also even more robust than the bcf against imbalances in left / right beam intensities . figures [ fig : pcf_imbforcevsvelocity][fig : pcf_ensembleimb ] show this behavior .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : pcf_forcevsimb ] that there is almost no effect from imbalances up to 5% except at extremely large detunings approaching 500  @xmath14 , which is outside the range used in experimental work to date . at larger imbalances a gradual degradation",
    "is predicted .",
    "like the bcf case , the force reduction is probably underestimated for large imbalances at large detunings , because here it comes mostly from sharp multiphoton resonances , many of which are probably eliminated by decoherence under experimental conditions .",
    "show a significant reduction of the force for a 25% imbalance , but less than for the bcf in fig . [",
    "fig : bcf_imbforcevsvelocity ] , and this reduction largely disappears at velocities above 80 @xmath50 . ]        . ]    in the bloch cylinder plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : pcf_ensembleimb ] , we note that a 25% imbalance causes a noticeable shift of the axis of symmetry away from the ground state , but the shift is smaller than in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcf_ensembleimb ] and the total excursions are much smaller .",
    "this likely accounts for the increased robustness of the four - color force .",
    "we have also briefly investigated the impact of adding additional frequency components at @xmath64 , and as one might expect , the benefits are not nearly so dramatic as for the initial additions at @xmath62 .",
    "also , the addition of still more colors increases the likelihood that inadvertent transitions to distant states will compromise the desired two - level cycling system .",
    "finally , we have confirmed numerically that adding a second harmonic at @xmath63 is deleterious in all regards , because it destroys the symmetry of the odd - harmonic superposition .",
    "thus we see little reason to go beyond the four - color case except under unusual circumstances .",
    "it might seem at first that a major obstacle in realizing the four - color pcf is the production of a laser beam with the required coherent superposition of four different frequencies .",
    "fortunately , this is easier than one might expect , because the frequencies are evenly spaced at intervals of @xmath80 .",
    "they can be obtained by a slight variation of the standard scheme used to produce beams for bcf experiments , which utilizes a double - passed acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) in which both the zero - order and first - order beams are retroreflected @xcite .",
    "if the entering zero - order beam is at frequency @xmath81 and the acoustic frequency of the aom is @xmath80 , the output consists of two beams that , if merged , contain equally - spaced frequencies at @xmath82 , @xmath81 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "we plan to test this scheme with a metastable helium beam in our laboratory , where ample laser power will soon be available using tapered laser diode amplifiers that are rated to provide more than 1  w at 1083  nm .    if may also be possible to generate the four - color beams by injecting rf radiation at multiples of @xmath52 into an electro - optic phase modulator ( eom ) with amplitudes chosen to suppress the carrier .",
    "however , an examination of the fm sideband spectrum for pure phase modulation indicates that at least three rf harmonics must be superposed to produce the correct pattern , and probably more , so the aom - based scheme seems more appealing .",
    "as stated previously , the basic concept behind the four - color force is that the addition of more colors creates a narrower pulse . in that spirit , why is it that we do not simply use a pulsed laser , or equivalently a chopped cw laser ?",
    "this is indeed a possibility .",
    "the first(and so far only ) demonstration of stimulated forces on molecules used a train of mode - locked laser pulses  @xcite , and recently the group of derevianko has proposed the use of a carefully tailored train of ultrashort @xmath5-pulses to produce stimulated cooling of molecules  @xcite .    however , there are a few important limitations .",
    "one is the purely technical issue that short - duration pulses with an area of @xmath85@xmath5 are not easily produced at arbitrary wavelengths .",
    "a more basic concern is that short - duration pulses inherently have broad linewidths , extending across much of the visible spectrum for femtosecond pulses .",
    "this will usually make it impossible to drive a pure two - level system , because numerous additional transitions will lie within the bandwidth .",
    "the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite is a special case that actually exploits the large bandwidth  here , the frequency - domain  teeth \" of a phase - stabilized frequency comb are carefully matched to the rotational spacings of a molecule .",
    "a more subtle but equally important consideration is that a simple pulse train lacks the robustness of polychromatic forces against left / right beam intensity imbalances . as explained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : obesim ] , it is the phase alternation between successive beat notes that gives rise to this robustness , because after a full four - pulse period ( two pulses from the left , and two from the right ) , the net pulse area is zero even for imbalanced beams .",
    "pulse trains from a pulsed laser lack this phase alternation , and in fact they typically lack any phase coherence at all except in the case of a phase - stabilized frequency comb .",
    "thus any any imbalance between pairs of counterpropagating pulses will result in a residual phase on the bloch sphere that accumulates with time , eventually reversing the direction of the force .",
    "this problem has been confirmed in our numerical simulations by removing the sign alternation in the interference envelope .",
    "as expected , the sensitivity to imbalance then reverts to that of the simple @xmath5-pulse model as described in section ii.c of ref .",
    "we have numerically studied the properties and behavior of systems under several different bichromatic and polychromatic light fields . with the assistance of  bloch cylinder \" plots of the bloch vector trajectory ,",
    "we show that the surprising robustness of polychromatic forces with imbalanced beam intensities stems from sign alternation of the pulse areas in a train of beat notes .",
    "this has important consequences for stimulated - force schemes relying on pulsed lasers .",
    "we also analyze the excited - state fraction in detail , and show that for the ordinary bcf under optimal conditions , the time - averaged excited - state fraction is 41% .",
    "a proposed extension to four - color polychromatic forces shows great promise . by adding components at @xmath86 to the usual bcf beams at @xmath0 ,",
    "the velocity range is increased by nearly a factor of three , the average excited - state fraction is reduced to 24% , and the force is increased by nearly 50% . the total laser power is larger only by a factor of @xmath87 , a modest price to pay compared with the factor of 9 that would be required for a bcf configuration at detuning 3@xmath52 .",
    "we also predict that the four - color force is significantly more robust in the presence of imbalanced beam intensities , especially if compared with a bcf with an increased detuning .",
    "plans are underway to test these ideas in metastable he , where a longitudinal declerator would benefit greatly from the increased velocity range .",
    "however , the greatest promise may be for applying stimulated optical forces to molecules , where a decreased excited - state fraction directly impacts the time available for the force to act prior to loss from radiative decay to dark states ."
