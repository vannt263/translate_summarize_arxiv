    "the only known collisional family in the kuiper belt was detected because of the unique spectral properties the family members ( brown et al .",
    "the near - infrared spectra of all other non - volatile rich kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) lie on a continuum between those whose spectra contain moderate amounts of water ice absorptions to those whose spectra are essentially featureless @xcite . in contrast , the near - infrared spectra of 2003 el61 , its largest satellite , and five other small kbos resemble laboratory spectra of pure crystalline water ice .",
    "remarkably , these objects are also relatively clustered in orbital element space .",
    "the largest object , 2003 el61 , had been previously suggested to have experienced a massive collision that imparted its fast ( 4-hour ) rotation , stripped off most of its icy mantle leaving it with a density close to rock ( 2.7 g / cc ) , and formed its two satellites @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the four extremely water ice rich kbos and the large satellite of 2003 el61 were in fact fragments of the icy mantle of the proto-2003 el61 that had been ejected during a massive collision .    while collisional families in the asteroid belt can be identified by their dynamical clustering alone , families in the kuiper belt are much harder to identify because the collisional ejection velocities can be a significant fraction of an object s orbital velocity .",
    "collisional fragments can therefore be spread out over a wide range of orbital element space with the fastest ejected fragments having significantly different orbits from the family core .",
    "the 2003 el61 family members were all identified on the basis of their unique surface properties : they are the only known objects in the kuiper belt with extremely pure water ice spectra and neutral visible colors .",
    "it is only because of this unique surface signature that detection of the 2003 el61 family members was possible .    in order to determine if other known kbos could be fragments of the 2003 el61 collision , @xcite integrated the orbits of 131 high inclination kbos to determine their proper orbital elements and minimum ejection velocities away from the 2003 el61 family core .",
    "they determined the minimum ejection velocity a kbo must have had in order to reach its present orbit from the modeled location of the family forming impact . in figure 1",
    "we show object h - magnitude vs. minimum ejection velocity ( from @xcite ) for the known kbos closest to the family core . for kbos in known resonances ,",
    "we plot the ejection velocity accounting for resonance diffusion @xcite . a large fraction of these objects",
    "have never been observed to determine if they have ir spectral signatures consistent with the 2003 el61 family members .",
    "it is important to note that though all of the known 2003 el61 family members have neutral visible colors , visible color or visible spectroscopy alone @xcite is not sufficient for family member identification .",
    "there are many kbos with neutral visible colors that do not also have strong water ice absorptions and are not members of the 2003 el61 collisional family .",
    "therefore , while visible colors can be used to rule out objects as potential family members , near infrared spectroscopy to determine water ice absorption depths is necessary for definitive family member identification .",
    "identifying additional family members and characterizing the extent of the spread of fragments throughout the kuiper belt may provide insight into the physics of this giant impact event in the outer solar system . in this letter",
    "we present near - infrared spectra obtained with the keck i telescope of kbos 2003 uz117 , 2005 cb79 and 2004 sb60 , objects that are located 67 , 97 , and 221 m / s away from the modeled 2003 el61 family core respectively ( fig 1 ) .",
    "2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 were suggested to be the most likely additional family candidates by @xcite .",
    "observations of 2003 uz117 , 2005 cb79 , and 2004 sb60 were performed with the near infrared camera ( nirc ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "objects were identified in the field by their motion relative to the background stars .",
    "targets were moved to the center of a 0.525 arcsecond wide slit and were then observed with either a j - through - h order sorting filter and a 120 lines per millimeter grism ( 2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 ) or an h - through - k order sorting filter and a 150 lines per millimeter grism ( 2004 sb60 ) . in all cases ,",
    "exposure times for the individual spectra were 200 seconds .",
    "targets were dithered along the slit in a five position nod pattern with 5 arcseconds between each dither . during observations the telescope tracked at each target s predicted rate of motion .",
    "low resolution spectral observations in the h ",
    "k ( 1.4 - 2.5 micron ) region are ideal for determining the presence or absence of water ice due to two broad water ice absorption features centered at 1.5 and 2.0 microns ( figure 2 ) .",
    "@xcite observed 45 kbos and centaurs in this wavelength range and parameterized all spectra with a two component model consisting of crystalline water ice covering a fraction of the surface , f , mixed linearly with dark continuum component with slope m , covering ( 1-f ) of the surface .",
    "they solved for m and f in each spectrum by using a least squares minimization scheme using the powell method .",
    "family members clearly stood out because of their high fractions of water ice ( f @xmath0 0.8 ) in this parameterization compared with all other objects in the survey ( f @xmath1 0.5 ) .",
    "low resolution spectral observations at h ",
    "k with nirc are only practical for objects with visual magnitudes less than @xmath221 .",
    "spectral observations in the j  h region of the spectrum ( 1.1 - 1.6 microns ) allow us probe the spectra of objects ( vmag@xmath221.5 ) that would be too faint to detect or obtain sufficient signal to noise in a reasonable amount of time with h  k spectroscopy .",
    "fortunately , the water ice absorption feature centered at @xmath21.5 microns is perfectly suited for detection with j  h spectroscopy .",
    "we can therefore observe kbos up to half a magnitude fainter than previous observations in h  k @xcite allowing us to detect strong water ice absorptions and determine if these smaller objects are also members of the 2003 el61 collisonal family .",
    "j  h spectra of two dynamically likely family members , 2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 ( visual magnitudes of 21.3 and 21.2 respectively ) were obtained .",
    "2003 uz117 was observed on 23 september 2007 ut for a total integration time of 4000 seconds .",
    "2005 cb79 was observed on 21 and 22 may 2007 ut for a total integration time of 12200 seconds .",
    "nearby g - type main sequence stars were observed within 0.1 airmass of the targets for telluric calibration .",
    "variable seeing , sky conditions , and occasionally poor tracking ( especially on the 2005 cb79 observations ) caused the individual spectra of each of the kbos to be of varying quality , thus only the highest signal - to - noise spectra were included and the rest discarded for this analysis .",
    "the final spectra consist of total integration times of 2800 seconds for 2003 uz117 and 5200 seconds for 2005 cb79 .",
    "spectral data reduction was carried out using standard procedures as described in brown ( 2000 ) and @xcite .",
    "the final 2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 spectra were each binned over four pixels to increase the signal to noise per pixel .",
    "we used a gaussian weighting function with a fwhm of 8 pixels resulting oversampled spectra with a spectral resolution of @xmath233 . in figure 2",
    "we show these spectra with one sigma error bars along with a model of pure water ice with 50 micron grain sizes at 50 k @xcite .",
    "we can quantitatively parameterize the amount of water ice using the same spectral model as @xcite but considering the wavelength region from 1.1 - 1.6 microns . using a powell minimization scheme to solve for the best fit of the parameters , m and f , we find that the spectra of 2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 are fit by water ice fractions of 0.92 @xmath3 and 1.02 @xmath4 respectively . the high fraction of water ice given by this parameterization for 2005 cb79 may be due to the fact that the water ice grain sizes on this object are somewhat larger than those modeled by @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the deep absorptions detected from @xmath21.4 - 1.6 microns on 2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 are clearly consistent with a high fraction of water ice ( in contrast with all other known kbos ) but comparable to the other 2003 el61 family members @xcite .",
    "2004 sb60 , with a visual magnitude of 20.8 was bright enough to be observed in h - k. we observed it on 23 september 2007 for a total integration time of 3000 seconds .",
    "data reduction was carried out as described above .",
    "a nearby g - type main sequence star was observed at similar ( within .03 ) airmass of the target .",
    "division of the 2004 sb60 spectrum by the star spectrum allowed us to calibrate telluric features .",
    "the resulting spectrum has a resolution r@xmath2160 .    using the same spectral parameterization of @xcite and described above",
    ", we find that the fraction of water ice in the spectrum of 2004 sb60 is consistent with 0% and can be no more than 0.05 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the low water ice fraction seen in the spectrum of 2004 sb60 is similar to that seen in many small kbos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of 2004 sb60 is clearly not consistent with the other members of the 2003 el61 collisional family that have water ice fractions greater than 0.8 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "2003 uz117 and 2005 cb79 contain high fractions of pure water ice on their surfaces and appear dynamically related to the other members of the 2003 el61 collisional family .",
    "we therefore conclude that they are members of this collisional family .",
    "thus far , all objects within 130 m / s of the modeled collision center @xcite have been shown to have the same unique strong water ice spectral signatures .",
    "2004 sb60 , at 221 m / s from the family core , has an essentially featureless spectrum inconsistent with 2003 el61 and its family members but comparable to many other small kbos .",
    "the flat spectrum we observed is consistent with infrared photometric observations of 2004 sb60 with hst by @xcite .",
    "infrared spectral or spectrophotometric observations of more potential fragments with minimum ejection velocities from @xmath2150 to @xmath2300 m / s could help constrain the extent to which fragments were scattered throughout the kuiper belt and could tell us about the physics of the giant impact itself .",
    "in addition to the distribution of fragments , any collisional model would also need to explain the the presence of the two satellites of 2003 el61 .    though it does not have the spectral signature of the fragments of the 2003 el61 collision ,",
    "2004 sb60 is an interesting object in its own right . @xcite",
    "have found this object to be one of the few high inclination small binary objects in the kuiper belt .",
    "it is worth noting the possibility that not all fragments of the 2003 el61 collision necessarily have the unique strong water ice signature .",
    "fragments from different locations in the initial parent body may have had different initial compositions .",
    "however , without this unique spectral signature , identification of an object as a family member is currently impossible .",
    "another object near the center of the 2003 el61 family is the third largest kbo , 2005 fy9 .",
    "2005 fy9 has a velocity closer to the center of the collision ( 150 m / s ) than one of the known fragments but has a spectrum dominated by methane , not water ice absorptions .",
    "we find it intriguing that two of the largest kbos are so close to each other in orbital element space but can think of no reason why they should be physically related .",
    "the spectral signature of extremely pure water ice found on 2003 el61 and its fragments and nowhere else in the kuiper belt is the only reason definitive identification of the collisonal family was possible .",
    "a collision with a non differentiated parent body would likely not produce such a distinct spectral signature in its fragments .",
    "future large scale surveys of the kuiper belt such as panstarrs and lsst are expected to increase the numbers of known kbos by over an order of magnitude . with higher numbers of objects , overdensities in certain regions may be revealed and families without unique spectral signatures may be able to be identified by their dynamics alone .",
