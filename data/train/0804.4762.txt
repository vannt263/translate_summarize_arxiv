    "graphene , for which an unconventional quantum hall effect has recently been discovered,@xcite is a peculiar condensed - matter realization of massless dirac fermions .",
    "while the quantum hall effect is generally characterized by a topological ( chern ) number , the peculiarity of landau levels ( ll ) in graphene appears as existence of the exactly zero energy landau level .",
    "we have established topological aspects in the graphene qhe@xcite , among which is a bulk - edge correspondence coming from the topological nature of bulk and edge states .",
    "all the topological features are intimately related with the chiral ( bipartite ) symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , which , in addition to being responsible for the zero energy landau level , gives a characteristic coexistence of extended and edge states at @xmath1@xcite .",
    "now , an interesting question is : can the zero energy landau level of the dirac fermion s be lifted when @xmath2 is situated right in the zero - th landau level . in the present paper",
    "we propose that an intriguing candidate for triggering the splitting should be a `` bond ordering '' , in which the electronic bonds have an ordering with a `` kekul pattern '' , arising either from a jahn - teller type distortion or electronic bond - order ( @xmath3 ) formation due to electron - electron interactions@xcite . reflecting the hexagonal symmetry",
    "there are three equivalent ordering ( `` kekul '' ) patterns ( see fig.1 ) , and the bond ordering is one way to break the degeneracy .",
    "the ordering , when static , produces a mass in the dirac fermion s dispersion ( in zero magnetic field ) , despite the fact that the bond ordering does _ not _ break the chiral symmetry . in magnetic fields ,",
    "the bond ordering acts to split the zero - energy landau level of the dirac fermions , which may be viewed as a kind of the peierls instability since the one - particle density of states diverges .",
    "we now examine the above idea in the simplest manner , i.e. , we assume that the ordering is static and adopt a hamiltonian that has the hopping @xmath4 with a kekul - type modulation , which represents , in a mean - field sense , the bond ordering , say , originating from the electron - electron interaction .",
    "we first take the case in which the ordering pattern has a translational symmetry as in fig.1 .",
    "the massless dirac fermions then acquire a mass which opens a gap ( fig .",
    "2 ) . as stressed the bond ordering does not destroy the chiral symmetry ( although the size of the brillouin zone is expanded ) , which implies that the particle - hole symmetry is preserved as well for any ( including random ) ordering patterns .",
    "this contracts with other types of modulation ( such as site dependent potentials ) which break the chiral symmetry .",
    "correspondingly , the zero - energy landau level in uniform magnetic fields , which is a special landau level sitting right at the dirac cone vertex , also splits into two @xcite .",
    "this implies that the bond ordering , which is here assumed , is expected to spontaneously induced in a self - consistent treatment as a kind of peierls instability in the zero - energy ll@xcite .",
    "times stronger than the others .",
    "the two arrows are unit vectors of the enlarged unit cell .",

    "we have seen that the bond ordering , when translationally symmetric , splits the zero - energy landau level accompanied by an energy gap at @xmath1 .",
    "however , there are a vast number of possible realizations of bond - ordering patterns that have no translational symmetry .",
    "specifically , there is an important class of such states that consist of  domains \" .",
    "namely , there are three , equivalent  kekul patterns ( differently colored in fig .",
    "1 ) , and there are a huge number of configurations where , e.g. , a bond - ordered phase with strong red bonds sits next to another phase with strong blue bonds ( fig .",
    "3 ) . we can then expect that  boundary states \" that are localized along the _ domain boundaries _ should appear as generalized boundary states in graphene , which have topological origin and stability.@xcite the situation reminds us of the well - known _ soliton _ modes across the different conjugated patterns in 1d polyacetylene .",
    "so the boundary states considered here is a 2d extension of solitons which are topologically protected .    the boundary states , whose energies reside in the gap of the split @xmath0 landau levels ,",
    "still do not violate the chiral symmetry .",
    "physically the situation is similar to the appearance of the zero - mode edge states along the zig - zag edges in graphene in zero magnetic field , which also have a topological origin .",
    "these loop - like boundary states ( `` strings '' ) may have different realization in 2d as further exemplified in fig .",
    "4 . in each case",
    "topologically stable boundary states arise near the zero energy as displayed in figs .",
