    "over the past decade , new definitions of black hole horizons have emerged which provide powerful tools for studying the behavior of black holes in the strongly dynamical regime .",
    "these ideas share the common philosophy that black holes should be thought of as physical objects in a spacetime that may be identified by local measurements .",
    "by contrast , traditional black holes and event horizons are globally defined properties of the causal structure of a spacetime @xcite .",
    "though there has always been a certain amount of interest in the dynamics of apparent horizons and their relation to black hole physics ( see for example @xcite ) , hayward began this line of research in earnest with his definition of _ trapping horizons_. these were initially used to formulate dynamic versions of the laws of black hole mechanics in a quasi - local context @xcite .",
    "since then however , they have found a variety of applications including , for example , studying interactions between black holes and gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "a bit later , the _ isolated horizons _ of ashtekar et al .",
    "@xcite were developed to provide a quasi - local characterization of the equilibrium states of black holes . in those works",
    ", it was shown that these objects obey a phase space formulation of the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "further , loop quantum gravity has made important use of them as boundary conditions in calculations of black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "closely related to both trapping and isolated horizons are _ dynamical horizons _",
    "@xcite , which characterize the dynamical phase of smooth black hole evolutions .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that flux laws can be formulated for these horizons that measure the growth of such quantities as energy and entropy .",
    "these laws contain terms that may be identified with fluxes of particular physical quantities such as matter and gravitational waves .",
    "a similar law exists for trapping horizons @xcite and it has been shown that the energy expressions involved agree with those derived in a hamiltonian analysis of horizons as spacetime boundaries @xcite .",
    "in other developments , studies have been made of the perturbative ,  almost isolated \" regime @xcite and isolated horizons have been given a convenient characterization in terms of multipole moments , which can be extended to a definition for the multipole moments for dynamical and trapping horizons @xcite .",
    "mathematical investigations have been made into such properties as existence and uniqueness @xcite and recently these notions have also begun to find application in the physical interpretation of numerical results @xcite .",
    "thus , isolated , dynamical and trapping horizons constitute an increasingly well - developed quasi - local framework for analytical as well as numerical studies of black hole dynamics in the strong field regime .",
    "however , in order to make effective use of them it is important to have clear intuition about how they behave .",
    "unfortunately , there is a paucity of good , analytical examples of spacetimes containing dynamical and/or trapping horizons and this has recently given rise to some confusion about the generic behavior of dynamical and trapping horizons . in this paper",
    "we will attempt to clarify matters by presenting several analytic and numerical examples of spacetimes containing these horizons .    before considering these in more detail ,",
    "let us recall the relevant definitions .",
    "from hayward @xcite we have : +   + * definition 1 . * a _ trapping horizon _",
    "@xmath5 is a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional spacetime that is foliated by 2-surfaces ( which we will take to be of spherical topology ) such that @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a trapping horizon is called _ outer _ if @xmath9 , _ inner _ if @xmath10 , _ future _ if @xmath11 and _ past _ if @xmath12 .",
    "+   + in this definition , and what follows , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the future - directed outgoing and ingoing null normals to a leaf of the foliation while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the expansion of the congruences of curves generated by those vector fields .",
    "further , it is assumed that @xmath17 has been extended so that it is surface generating ( ie .",
    "@xmath18 ) in some neighbourhood of @xmath5 . then , from the definition",
    ", outer trapping horizons have trapped surfaces  just inside \" them while inner trapping horizons have trapped surfaces  just outside \" .",
    "we will mainly be interested in a slight generalization of _ future _ trapping horizons that was recently introduced by ashtekar and galloway @xcite : +   + * definition 2 . * a _ marginally trapped tube ( mtt ) _ , @xmath19 is a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional spacetime that is foliated by two - surfaces ( again assumed to be of spherical topology ) such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "+   + we refer to the leaves of the foliation as _ marginally trapped surfaces_. mtts have no restriction on their signature , which is allowed to vary over the hypersurface . however , if an mtt is everywhere spacelike it is referred to as a _ dynamical horizon _",
    "@xcite , if it is everywhere timelike then it called a _",
    "timelike membrane _ ( tlm )",
    "@xcite , and if it is everywhere null and non - expanding then we have an _ isolated horizon_.    note that the distinction between dynamical horizons and timelike membranes is more than just a technical difference of signature . for example , it is clear that since dynamical horizons are spacelike they may only be crossed in one direction by causal curves ; this is a key characteristic of black hole horizons . by contrast , a timelike membrane , being timelike , obviously does not share this property .",
    "further , it may be shown that while dynamical horizons always expand as they evolve , timelike membranes always shrink .",
    "finally , in contrast to the dynamical horizon flux laws of @xcite , both the geometrical and matter contributions have indefinite signatures in the corresponding equations on timelike membranes .",
    "in particular , the geometric term no longer has a natural interpretation as a flux of gravitational radiation energy .",
    "simple explicit examples of trapping horizons / mtts are provided by the vaidya spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these are spherically symmetric solutions to einstein s equations describing the formation / growth of a black hole as null dust falls in from infinity . in the absence of a cosmological constant ,",
    "the growth of the resulting black hole is always characterized by a dynamical / future outer trapping horizon . in the presence of a cosmological constant",
    "the situation is a little more complicated as a second mtt appears  a timelike membrane which can be associated with the cosmological horizon .",
    "still , even in this case , the mtt associated with the black hole remains a dynamical horizon .",
    "heuristic arguments presented in @xcite and @xcite suggest that under physically reasonable circumstances the mtts associated with black hole formation and growth will always be spacelike and so future _ outer _ trapping horizons are generic in this context . _",
    "this intuition needs to be amended_. in oppenheimer - snyder spacetimes @xcite , which describe the gravitational collapse of spherical dust clouds , it has been shown that timelike membranes , rather than dynamical horizons , appear during the formation of black holes .",
    "these spacetimes are constructed out of a piece of the closed frw universe ( which forms a homogeneous and isotropic dust ball ) surgically inserted into a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "as this `` star '' is allowed to collapse the horizon structure develops in the following way .",
    "at first there are no horizons . then , as the dust reaches a critical density an isolated horizon forms that cuts off the continuing collapse from the rest of the universe ( in this case it is also an event horizon ) .",
    "coincidentally , a timelike membrane appears and contracts inside the isolated horizon until it reaches zero area .    in this case , the timelike membrane is clearly associated with the formation of the black hole and can not be dismissed as `` cosmological '' .",
    "one might argue that the os spacetime is not very physical .",
    "nevertheless , the question remains as to what is the generic behavior of mtts during the formation or growth of a black hole .",
    "when are they spacelike and when are they timelike ?",
    "equivalently , when do they grow in the way that one would intuitively expect and when do they shrink ?    in this paper , we present several new examples of mtt - containing spacetimes . from these",
    ", we see that in most circumstances horizons are either isolated or dynamical , spacelike , and expanding .",
    "however , under certain conditions more interesting behaviours are seen .",
    "there are two ways in which new horizons may form where they did not exist before . in the first",
    ", an mtt may appear out of a singularity ( such as a point of infinite density ) .",
    "in the second , large ( though not infinite ) concentrations of matter may force the creation of a dynamical horizon - timelike membrane pair .",
    "such formations are closely related to the well - known phenomena of  jumping \" apparent horizons @xcite",
    ".    horizons may also disappear .",
    "timelike membrane - dynamical horizon pairs can annihilate each other or alternatively mtts can vanish into singularities .",
    "figure [ mttbehaviours ] schematically displays some of these behaviours , and also suggests another interpretation .",
    "one can think of a single mtt that winds its way forwards and backwards through time rather than multiple dynamical horizons , timelike membranes , and isolated horizons that appear and disappear .",
    "for simplicity we will usually only consider spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "manifolds will be smooth unless stated otherwise .",
    "we use units such that @xmath22 , and spacetimes have signature @xmath23 .",
    "we will assume that the einstein equations hold , with matter satisfying the null energy condition .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ mtt ]",
    "we explain the basic properties of mtts .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the signature of the metric induced on an mtt by the spacetime metric depends on the matter present and then examine several different types of matter . in section [ dust ]",
    "we illustrate the analytic evolution of mtts in various situations for the case of pressureless dust . in section [ scalarfields ]",
    "we consider a couple of numerical examples of mtts in the presence of a massive scalar field .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as we have seen , the definition of mtts is weaker than that of both dynamical horizons and timelike membranes ( there is no restriction on the signature of the metric on @xmath19 ) , and of trapping horizons ( there is no restriction that @xmath24 ) . on an mtt",
    ", both the induced metric signature and @xmath25 are allowed to vary .",
    "there are simple procedures which may be used to determine this signature . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes ; the general case is closely related ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) . with this condition ,",
    "it is natural to restrict our attention to similarly symmetric mtts .",
    "further , it will be convenient to use the symmetry to foliate the spacetime into spacelike two - spheres and so extend the definitions of @xmath26 , @xmath14 and @xmath27 off of @xmath19 .",
    "we require that all such quantities share the symmetry and for simplicity will also impose the standard condition that @xmath28 .",
    "next , following the conventions of @xcite , we let @xmath29 be a vector field which is : 1 ) tangential to @xmath19 , 2 ) everywhere orthogonal to the foliation by marginally trapped surfaces , and 3 ) generates a flow which preserves the foliation . thus ,",
    "if @xmath30 is a foliation label , @xmath31 is a function of @xmath30 only  it is independent of the exact position on a leaf .",
    "then it is always possible to find a function @xmath32 and normalization of @xmath26 such that @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the definition of @xmath29 implies that @xmath34 , which gives us an expression for @xmath32 : c = .",
    "[ defc ] note that @xmath35 , so that the sign of @xmath32 determines the signature of @xmath19 : if @xmath36 it is spacelike , if @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) or becomes undefined ( @xmath39 while @xmath40 ) it is null , and if @xmath41 it is timelike .",
    "in addition , the sign of @xmath32 determines whether @xmath19 is expanding , contracting , or unchanging in area .",
    "indeed , denoting the area element of the two - sphere cross - sections by @xmath42 , one has _",
    "[ area ] this means that the expansion or contraction of an mtt is linked to its signature ( since @xmath43 ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath19 is spacelike it expands while when it is timelike it contracts .",
    "further ( [ defc ] ) explains the close relationship between the various trapping horizons and mtts . if the null energy condition holds , then the numerator is non - positive ( by the raychaudhuri equation ) .",
    "thus , the sign of @xmath32 is determined by the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "away from isolation and cases where @xmath44 , an mtt is a dynamical horizon if and only if it is a future outer trapping horizon . similarly it is a timelike membrane if and only it is a future inner trapping horizon .    to understand the generic behavior of these spherically symmetric mtts we focus on this function @xmath32 .",
    "then , keeping in mind that @xmath45 , from the raychaudhuri equation it is easy to see that @xmath46 while from @xmath47 one can show that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the scalar curvature of the two - sphere cross - section of the mtt foliation ( the easiest way to see this is to consult a table of the newman - penrose equations , for example in @xcite ) .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ defc ] ) , c = , [ f ] where @xmath1 is the area of a two - sphere cross - section of the mtt .",
    "as noted above , if the null energy condition holds then the numerator is non - negative .",
    "thus , the sign of @xmath32 depends on the relative magnitude of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the mtt behaviours implied by ( [ defc ] ) and ( [ f ] ) are closely related to theorem 2 of @xcite , which may be summarized as follows .",
    "suppose a ( not necessarily spherically symmetric ) spacetime is foliated by a family @xmath52 of spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "let @xmath53 be a marginally outer trapped surface , i.e. , @xmath45 for an outgoing null normal @xmath13 while the ingoing null expansion is unrestricted .",
    "suppose @xmath54 is also `` strictly stably outermost '' , which roughly means that if @xmath54 is deformed outward , the corresponding deformation of the outgoing null expansion is non - negative and positive somewhere . then first of all , @xmath54 is contained in a horizon @xmath5 foliated by marginally outer trapped leaves that lie in @xmath52 , which exists at least as long as these leaves remain strictly stably outermost .",
    "moreover , if the null energy condition holds , @xmath5 is achronal . if @xmath55 somewhere on @xmath54 , then @xmath5 is spacelike everywhere near @xmath56 .    the condition that @xmath54 be strictly stably",
    "outermost is equivalent to the requirement that a certain operator @xmath57 acting on functions @xmath58 on @xmath54 has a strictly positive principal eigenvalue . restricting ourselves to spherical symmetry again and using the einstein equations",
    ", this operator reduces to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the laplacian operator on the round 2-sphere @xmath54 and @xmath61 the scalar curvature of @xmath54 .",
    "the principal eigenvalue ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) is then @xmath63.\\ ] ] according to the theorem in @xcite , if the null energy condition holds then @xmath64 implies local achronality of the horizon , consistent with our considerations above . if , moreover , @xmath65 on @xmath54 then the horizon must be spacelike , which is again as we found .",
    "thus , the main results of @xcite applied to the case of spherical symmetry are neatly encapsulated in the expression ( [ f ] ) for the function @xmath32 , which , however , will also tell us when we are dealing with a timelike membrane .",
    "we now consider eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) for some particular types of matter .        for a perfect fluid that moves along timelike worldlines with unit tangent @xmath66 ,",
    "the stress - energy tensor takes the form t_ab = ( + p ) u_a u_b + p g_ab , where @xmath2 is the matter density of the fluid and @xmath3 is the pressure .",
    "writing @xmath67 for some function @xmath68 , we find that c = , [ perfectfluid ] and see that a priori , the mtt could have spacelike , null , or timelike evolution , the deciding factor being the magnitude of @xmath4 relative to @xmath69 .",
    "simple examples of the various behaviours may be found in robertson - walker spacetimes @xcite . in the case where these cosmological models are collapsing",
    ", one can find spherical mtts through all points in @xmath70 . picking a single mtt for definiteness ( or equivalently selecting a  centre \" for the universe ) , and assuming an equation of state of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is some constant , these surfaces are : i ) timelike and contracting if @xmath73 ( this includes a dust - filled universe , @xmath74 , and so the timelike contractions seen in oppenheimer - snyder collapse ) , ii ) null and contracting if @xmath75 ( a radiation filled universe with divergent @xmath32 ) , and iii ) spacelike and expanding if @xmath76 . , the signature of the mtt is determined by @xmath77 .",
    "] for now , we are not too concerned with the physical interpretation of such models and evolutions , but instead just note that these are all allowed mathematical possibilities .    in the case of pressureless dust ,",
    "@xmath78 , one has the following heuristic picture deciding how the mtt will behave at a given two - sphere cross - section .",
    "foliate spacetime by the level surfaces of dust particle proper time .",
    "fix such a slice , let @xmath79 be some radial coordinate , and define the `` mass enclosed by a sphere with coordinate radius @xmath79 '' to be @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the mass of a single particle and @xmath82 the number of particles with radial coordinate smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ perfectfluid ] ) can be rewritten as c = , [ heuristic ] where @xmath83 with @xmath84 the areal radius , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are two quantities with dimensions of surface density .",
    "@xmath87 is the change of enclosed mass with area , while @xmath85 is a purely geometric quantity associated with the mtt : _",
    "t = m_t , with @xmath88 the instantaneous mass of the mtt and @xmath89 the scalar curvature of the 2-sphere cross - section .",
    "@xmath85 is a straightforward generalization of the _ mass aspect _ for isolated and dynamical horizons @xcite : it determines the mass multipoles of the mtt and as such its definition and physical meaning are not restricted to spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , the relative magnitude of the `` matter surface density '' @xmath86 and the `` geometric surface density '' @xmath85 is what governs the behavior of the mtt . given a 2-sphere cross - section of the mtt , if the matter surface density is larger than the geometric surface density then the mtt will contract because of eq .",
    "( [ area ] ) , and in that case it must be timelike .",
    "if on the other hand the matter surface density is smaller than the geometric one , the mtt will expand , in which case it must be spacelike . when the two balance each other the mtt is null ( though not isolated , as in this case @xmath90 rather than @xmath91 ) .      we next consider a null fluid that moves inwards from infinity towards some centre with tangent vector @xmath14 . then",
    ", the stress - energy tensor is t_ab = ( + p ) n_a n_b , [ nullfluid ] and so one quickly finds that c = 2a(+ p ) 0 .",
    "hence , for matter of this type , the mtt can only be either isolated ( if @xmath92 ) or spacelike and expanding ( otherwise ) .",
    "indeed , this is the type of matter in the vaidya spacetime where it is well known that mtts demonstrate only these behaviours @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the vaidya spacetimes can be generalized to include both outgoing and ingoing null dust , plus a distribution of energy whose rest frame is stationary . in such cases , the mtt can again be timelike , as follows from the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we suspect that with a careful choice of the parameters in these models , one could also generate examples of mtts that are partly timelike , partly null , and partly spacelike . however",
    ", we will not discuss these examples further here , choosing instead to focus our attention on the more astrophysically relevant timelike dust spacetimes of section [ dust ] .",
    "the final matter model that we will consider is that of a scalar field @xmath93 .",
    "this has stress - energy tensor t_ab = ( _ a _ b - _ c ^c g_ab - v ( ) g_ab ) , [ scalart ] where @xmath94 is a potential function . for arbitrary potentials",
    ", @xmath32 takes the form c = .",
    "[ cscalar ] if @xmath95 ( a massless scalar field ) , then @xmath96 implies that the mtt must be spacelike .",
    "however , unless @xmath97 is negative definite , a non - zero potential a priori allows for spacelike , null , and timelike evolutions . in particular",
    ", this is the case for a massive klein - gordon field where @xmath98 for some @xmath99 .",
    "examples of all of the mtt behaviours discussed above can be seen within the tolman - bondi family of solutions . in this section",
    "we will review this surprisingly rich set of solutions and then discuss specific members which display the various behaviours .",
    "these solutions describe the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric dust clouds .",
    "they are very easy to work with and allow us to trace the evolution of a spacetime from specified initial conditions . a nice discussion can be found in the early part of @xcite and with minor changes , we will follow that description below .",
    "initial conditions are given on a spherically symmetric , spacelike , three - surface @xmath56 .",

    "then @xmath118 and so @xmath119 .",
    "if we further restrict our attention to initial conditions for which all matter is initially either stationary or infalling ( @xmath120 ) , it is not hard to use the einstein equations to show that with @xmath104 as the proper time measured by observers comoving with the dust , ( , r ) = - , [ eerem ] where @xmath121 is defined as the areal radius at time @xmath104 of the dust shell that had initial areal radius @xmath79 on @xmath56 .",

    "the non - zero components of the extrinsic curvature from the dust side are @xmath136 and from the schwarzschild side we again get the same with @xmath135 replaced by @xmath70 .",
    "thus the resulting restrictions are quite simple .",

    "thus , given initial conditions , we can analytically calculate the full , four - dimensional metric as long as the gaussian normal coordinate system remains valid .",
    "as can be inferred from the preceding discussion , the reason for this simplicity is that any shell of radius @xmath79 effectively evolves along the geodesics of a schwarzschild solution of mass @xmath112  outer shells do not affect the evolution of inner shells and inner shells only affect outer shells through the total mass function @xmath112 .",

    "then , for a solar mass black hole , @xmath238 which is about an order of magnitude higher than the density of a neutron star .",
    "by contrast , for a supermassive black hole of mass @xmath239 , one has @xmath240 , the density of water .    though strictly speaking these results only apply in situations of spherical symmetry",
    ", it seems fairly safe to use them to draw some more general conclusions .",
    "specifically , it is likely that both modes of expansion are not only mathematically possible as we have seen in this paper , but also both occur in physical situations . for small black holes ,",
    "even if the lack of spherical symmetry changes these estimates by several orders of magnitude , it appears that dynamical horizon spacelike expansions are probably the dominant mode in all but the most extreme situations , such as black hole and/or neutron star collisions .",
    "numerical studies support this contention as in such extreme situations the occurrence of multiple horizons appears to be generic @xcite ( though also relatively unstudied in a systematic way , since in most studies it is the exterior spacetime that is of interest and so the interior of the outermost apparent horizon is excised and thrown away ) . by contrast for supermassive black holes ,",
    "it is likely that horizon jumps / tlms are much more common .",
    "these examples also suggest other ( possible ) properties of mtts .",
    "first , dynamical horizons appear to only originate either out of singularities ( the density singularities of [ dustcollapse_sec ] ) or as part of a dynamical horizon / tlm pair ( as in [ mtlm ] ) .",
    "equivalently , in all of our examples there is just one mtt associated with each black hole .",
    "this originates in a singularity and then weaves backwards and forwards in time , always expanding in area ( relative to a foliation parameter that monotonically increases as one moves away from the singularity ) .",
    "this suggests that a similar result may be true away from spherical symmetry  the multiple horizons / jumps seen in numerical studies of black hole collisions may actually all be part of a single mtt that weaves backwards and forwards in time .    in our examples",
    "it is also true that tlms and dynamical horizons always occur in such a way that a causal signal originating from the mtt would never be detectable by sufficiently far - away observers .",
    "this is consistent with a gravitational confinement theorem due to israel @xcite which states that if the weak energy condition holds ( as is the case in all our examples ) , a trapped two - sphere can be extended to a spacelike three - cylinder foliated by trapped two - spheres of _ constant area_. assuming reasonably regular spacetimes , this three - cylinder will act as a permanent one - way membrane for causal effects .",
    "even though an observer `` inside '' an mtt can escape that trapped region , he will not be able to send signals beyond the areal radius of the two - sphere on which the mtt was first crossed .",
    "we note that israel s confinement theorem is quite general ; it does not assume spherical symmetry or even asymptotic flatness .",
    "moreover , in appropriate asymptotically flat spacetimes , trapped surfaces must necessarily be contained within event horizons and so unable to send causal signals to null infinity @xcite .",
    "our asymptotically flat examples are also consistent with the latter : the outermost parts of mtts are dynamical horizons which asymptote to a null surface with some finite area .",
    "consequently , in physically realistic spacetimes , any tlms that may be present will be hidden from observers far from a black hole , also in the absence of spherical symmetry .    in summary , even though the examples and ( dust ) calculations that we have seen in this paper are quite simple we believe that they are extremely useful in forming a correct intuition about the behaviour of mtts during general black hole evolution . in particular they provide a convenient testing ground for ideas about these evolutions which is much simpler than full numerical simulations of black hole collisions and yet still significantly richer ( and more realistic ) than the heretofore studied analytical examples ( vaidya and oppenheimer - snyder ) . as such they should be useful in , among other things , suggesting possible extensions of the recent mathematical investigations @xcite of mtt properties .",
