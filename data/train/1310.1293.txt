    "the nature of the distribution of electrons and positive ions about the track of an ionizing particle as it passes through matter has been of interest for many years , beginning with jaff@xcite who first discussed the influence of an electric field on the recombination of these charges .",
    "he assumed the ions and electrons formed two inter - penetrating columns of charges , the recombination of which is determined by the interaction of the columns with one another and an applied electric field . later onsager@xcite pointed out that in many physical situations recombination is more likely to involve the interaction of a single pair of charges that are closest to one another rather than with the extended sea of other charges .",
    "both the columnar and geminate approaches to recombination of charges have been complemented , criticized , modified , and extended in various ways in hundreds of papers in order to understand better the effects of ionizing radiation in a variety of materials .",
    "the recent use of the liquefied noble gases as radiation detectors for exotic particles with improved energy resolution has generated renewed attention to these problems@xcite .",
    "+ we have been considering the possible use of liquid helium as a detection medium for neutrinos and dark matter particles@xcite .",
    "hence , we have become interested in the scintillation and in the recombination of charges about the track of an ionizing particle in liquid helium .",
    "this paper is directed to a discussion of what can be determined about the charge distribution about an electron track in helium from a measurement of the current as a function of an electric field applied to the liquid in which ionizing particles are stopped .",
    "+ liquid helium has a number of advantages , when compared to other substances , as a medium in which to study the charge distribution about the track of an ionizing particle .",
    "the atomic physics of an electron collision with a helium atom has been well studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "similarly , the dynamics of a collision of a proton and an alpha particle with a helium atom has been investigated extensively , see ref .",
    "@xcite for references .",
    "the properties of thermalized electrons and helium ions are well known in the liquid@xcite .",
    "an electron forms a cavity , or  bubble \" of 1.9 nm radius , for the reason that in so doing the exchange energy with electrons on neighboring atoms is decreased . a positive he@xmath0 ion , on the other hand , first forms a dimer he@xmath1 that becomes the core of a solid  snowball \" , because of electrostriction , with radius less than that of the electron bubble .",
    "+ a consideration of the interaction between an electron and a positive ion in the presence of an applied electric field has led us to a means of determining the charge distribution produced by an electron track in liquid helium .",
    "the field dependence of the ionization current ( the probability of escape from recombination in the language of onsager ) can be used to measure the charge distribution under the conditions that are applicable in liquid helium , in particular , a system where the charges move with a velocity proportional to the force applied .",
    "this requirement that the mobility of the charges is a constant , independent of electric field , while valid for localized charges in liquid helium , does not apply to the motion of delocalized electrons in the heavier liquefied noble gases or the motion of electrons with extended wave functions in gases and liquids , more generally .",
    "delocalized electrons are heated by the electric field and as a consequence the momentum transfer cross section increases and the mobility decreases with field@xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , this analysis does not take into account the effects of diffusion , which is central in the onsager treatment of geminate recombination .",
    "the absence of any regard for diffusion is justified in considering the motion of charges in liquid helium because of the low temperature , but this simplification limits the applicability of the present analysis to other systems .",
    "that diffusion can be neglected for the motion of charges in liquid helium is shown to be valid later in this paper using the onsager theory . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii develops an analytic technique for determining the charge distribution of secondary electrons produced by a primary ionizing electron .",
    "section iii discusses the charge distribution inferred from the current produced by a @xmath2ni beta source in helium , and section iv summarizes the results of this analysis .",
    "the energy distribution of secondary electrons produced by the ionization of helium as a consequence of being hit by an energetic electron , proton or alpha particle has been determined in a number of experiments . in general , the number of secondaries decreases as their energy increases . for an energetic alpha particle",
    "the secondaries can have energies extending up into the several hundred ev@xcite .",
    "however , when the primary ionizing particle is an electron with energy below 100  kev , the secondaries rarely have energies above the first excitation level of 19.8 ev .",
    "the only mechanism by which these secondary electrons can lose energy and thermalize is by elastic scattering from helium atoms , a very inefficient process because of the mass difference between the electron and atom .",
    "the kinetic energy of an electron must drop to 1  ev or below before it becomes localized by forming a bubble .",
    "the fractional energy loss of an electron in a collision with an atom is the order of @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of the electron and helium atom , respectively .",
    "hence the number of collisions required to reduce the energy from , say , 10 ev to 1 ev is @xmath6 the elastic scattering cross section varies somewhat with energy of the electron varying from @xmath7 @xmath8 at 20 ev to @xmath9 @xmath8 at 1 ev@xcite . since the number density of liquid helium is @xmath10 @xmath11 , the mean free path is the order of @xmath12 cm and an electron in undergoing a random walk as it thermalizes will be roughly within a sphere @xmath13 cm from the positive ion . +",
    "the stopping power@xcite and w - value of 43  ev of helium are such that for an electron with energy of 17  kev ( the mean energy of electrons from the @xmath2ni beta emitter used in this experiment ) the average separation of ionization events in the liquid is @xmath14  cm .",
    "thus , an electron is more likely to remain closer to its ionic partner than to other ions .",
    "the recombination is considered to be geminate . once the electron is localized in a bubble , the ion and electron move in their opposite s coulomb field and whatever applied field exists .",
    "the positive ion snowball , because of its smaller size , has a somewhat larger mobility than the electron and accounts for most of the relative motion . under typical conditions of temperature and applied field ( the field is not so large or the temperature not so low that the moving charges create vortex rings ) the charges move in a viscous medium with a velocity proportional to the force on them .",
    "+      when moving in a viscous medium , a pair of isolated charges of opposite sign will recombine or instead be separated by an applied electric field , depending on their initial separation and orientation with respect to the field .",
    "the condition for separation , derived in the appendix , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial separation of the charges , and @xmath17 is the angle the vector connecting the charges makes with the applied field @xmath18 .",
    "the critical assumption in deriving this equation is that the mobility is independent of velocity ( electric field ) , that is , the parameter @xmath19 is the same in eqs .",
    "( a3 ) and ( a4 ) .",
    "this is based on the fact that the bubble and snowball are large objects with hydrodynamic masses the order of 100 helium atoms , and their motion in the normal fluid can be considered to be that of rigid spheres in a viscous continuum .",
    "experimentally , keshishev _",
    "et al._@xcite found in normal liquid helium no dependence of the mobility of either the bubble or snowball on field up to @xmath20  v / cm . + the distribution of secondary electrons with respect to their respective geminate partner , @xmath21 , once they have thermalized in undergoing random elastic scattering , is taken to be independent of orientation and only dependent on distance .",
    "then the fraction of electrons that escape recombination as a function of field is given by    @xmath22 @xmath23 or @xmath24      if a beta source of moderate activity is placed inside a cell to which a uniform field can be applied then the steady state current produced by ionization is @xmath25 the current is expressed as a fraction of the value it would have if all the charges were separated by the field . + since the argument within the integral is zero at the lower limit ,",
    "the derivative of current with respect to field is @xmath26 then @xmath27 and its derivative @xmath28 hence , the dependence of current on field provides a means to obtain the charge distribution , @xmath21 , where @xmath29 . @xmath30 the charge distribution can be determined from the first and second derivatives of the current with respect to field .",
    "a measurement of current with respect to field was made in three different cells .",
    "all cells were cylindrical with electrodes on the ends of the cylinder . for measurements in the liquid , one cell had a diameter of 2.5  cm and a height of 0.4  cm ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) , and another had dimensions of 6  cm diameter and 1  cm height .",
    "for measurements in the gas , the cell had a diameter of 6 cm and height of 3.8  cm .",
    "the source of electrons was a 1  mci @xmath2ni  @xmath31 emitter having an end point of 66  kev .",
    "the source was placed on a metal substrate that was part of one of the electrodes .",
    "the range of a 66  kev electron is @xmath32  cm in 2.5  k liquid and is 0.6  cm in 4  k gas .",
    "therefore , for all measurements all primary electrons ranged out well within the cell .",
    "the saturation current , measured in gas , was 2900  pa .",
    "the accuracy to which the current could be determined varied somewhat with the measurement , ranging from 0.1  pa at low currents to 5% of the value at high currents",
    ". measurements of current were made with both polarities of the field between the electrodes .",
    "the results for the two polarities were consistent with each other when account was taken for the contribution from the primary electrons , which was about 6.2  pa , corresponding to a source activity of 1  mci .",
    "the absence polarity dependence indicates that certain possible systematic effects were small ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the ratio between the saturation current and the current due to the primary electrons is consistent with the known @xmath33  value of 43  ev .",
    "the data for liquid taken with two different cells were consistent with each other within the uncertainty of the measurements where the data overlap .",
    "this indicates that geometry dependent systematic effects , such as those due to leakage currents , are smaller than the statistical uncertainty .",

    "the distribution obtained from the data does not decrease exponentially with distance but rather varies approximately as a power law , at least over a limited range in @xmath38 . at large distances the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] has approximately an @xmath39 dependence .",
    "the distribution has , in the jargon of probability theory , a `` fat '' or `` long '' tail . +",
    "this dependence can not be attributed to diffusion , which has not been included in the analysis .",
    "this can be verified in a number of ways .",

    "is plotted as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] .",
    "the striking difference between this curve and the measured current clearly demonstrates that the analysis of the existence of the fat tail is robust , independent of the empirical fitting of the current distribution or extrapolations thereof .",
    "+ distributions with long - tail behavior are observed to occur in many physical problems in which rare , outlying events appear more frequently than expected on the basis of a simple model of a random process . in the present case",
    "the number of the charges separated by distances larger than expected compared to that for a gaussian distribution , which fits reasonably well the density profile at small separations , is substantial .",

    "however , as is well known@xcite , in situations where the size of the steps in a random walk is not fixed , and a substantial difference in step length can occur , such as an occasional long step ( sometimes referred to as levy motion ) , the distribution is non - gaussian and can have long tails .",

    "furthermore , the time between steps is expected to be highly variable@xcite .",
    "the general picture of the mechanism by which an electron becomes thermalized involves the electron in its random walk encountering a region in the liquid where the density is low because of fluctuations .",
    "the exchange energy of the non - localized electron with the bound atomic electrons is less in this low density environment .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that the electron could have resonant states in the continuum because of the attractive potential well .",
    "the enhanced probability of the electron in a resonant state scattering off atoms would have the effect of deepening the potential well . at some point in an electron",

    "the number of these additional charges is not sufficient to affect appreciably the analysis of the initial charge distribution , but we discuss them as a possible source of minor error .",
    "photoemission_. when an excited helium atom or excimer , he@xmath48 @xcite , radiatively decays to the ground state , it does so with the emission of a photon with a energy between 13 and 20  ev .",

    "furthermore , if such a current any larger than this were present , then there should be a noticeable change in current on reversing the polarity of the electrodes in the cells , something that is not observed over that due to the primary electrons from the @xmath2ni source .",

    "the probability of electron ejection in vacuum can be large , ranging from a few percent to 30% depending on the surface .",
    "but again , in liquid helium an electron will not diffuse far and will return to the surface under the influence of its image charge . only in the field",
    "next to the cathode will the electron have a chance to escape .",
    "the contribution to the current from such electrons is expected to be no greater than those from photoemission , and , to the extent that they are produced , they contribute only at high fields where recombination is small .",
    "+ 3 ) _ excimers_. the he@xmath0 ion or an excited atom he@xmath51 quickly ( @xmath52  s ) form a dimer with a ground state helium , the binding energy being close to 2  ev . while spin - singlet excimers decay to the dissociated ground state in the order of @xmath53  s , the triplet excimer in its lowest energy state , he@xmath54(a@xmath55 ) , has a radiative lifetime of 13  s@xcite .",
    "when two of these excimers encounter one another in diffusing through the liquid , they interact , producing an ion / electron pair through the exothermic penning process @xmath56 the electron has an energy of roughly 10  ev and must thermalize in the same manner as those produced in the initial ionization event . hence , the distribution of electrons from their geminate positive ions generated by the penning annihilation of excimers is the same as the distribution from that of the primary ionization .",
    "the fact that the number of excimers depends upon recombination and therefore on applied electric field does lead to a correction in the relationship between field dependence of the current and the density distribution as expressed by eq.([eq.dis ] ) , however , the effect is small even at low electric fields where the contribution from penning ionization is largest .",
    "the expected ratio of the number of triplet excimers at low field to the total number of ionizations is 50%,@xcite . a numerical calculation assuming the maximum possible influence of excimers , that all metastable excimers undergo penning ionization rather than radiatively decay , results in the size of fat tail of distribution being decreased somewhat but its existence and shape are unaltered , see fig .",
