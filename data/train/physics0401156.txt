    "in their basic form photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) typically consist of fused silica with an arrangement of air - holes running along the full length of the fiber ( for a recent review we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . traditionally , triangular  @xcite or honeycomb  @xcite",
    "cladding arrangements of the air - holes have been considered with the core defect formed by removing or adding an additional air - hole in the lattice , respectively .",
    "this is of course the most obvious way to form a defect in a regular lattice .",
    "however , for the honeycomb lattice ( see fig .",
    "1 ) there is at least one alternative approach which involves additional use of index - altering dopants .",
    "recently , lgsgaard and bjarklev  @xcite suggested how a low - index band - gap guiding core could be formed in a germanium doped honeycomb lattice by absence of doping in the core region .",
    "here , we suggest doping by fluorine which results in an index - guiding core .",
    "fluorine - doped pcfs have previously been considered by mangan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who fabricated a triangular air - hole cladding pcf with a fluorine - doped silica core region . at sufficiently short wavelengths",
    "the core index is lower than the effective index of the cladding and the pcf is anti - guiding , but as the wavelength is increased the effective index of the cladding decreases and eventually becomes lower than the core index so that light is guided in the core region . in the present work we use",
    "fluorine doping to form a novel large - mode area pcf and the proposed fiber structure may be an alternative to existing large - mode area designs employing a triangular air - hole arrangement in the cladding @xcite .",
    "we consider the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where fluorine doped regions ( of diameter @xmath2 ) are incorporated in a honeycomb lattice of air - holes ( of diameter @xmath3 and nearest - neighbor spacing @xmath4 ) .",
    "the core region is formed by the absence of doping in the central region of the structure . at sufficiently short wavelengths",
    "the cladding states will avoid the fluorine - doped regions and the effective cladding index will in some sense resemble that for a triangular arrangement of holes whereas at longer wavelengths the field averages over the fluorine - doped and pure silica regions so that the effective index resembles that of a honeycomb lattice ( with a slightly down - shifted background index ) .",
    "the defect region has six - fold rotational symmetry and thus supports a doubly degenerate fundamental mode @xcite .",
    "we have fabricated the proposed fiber by the stack - and - pull method @xcite with hexagonal stacking of fluorine - doped rods ( step - index like doping profile ) and fused silica tubes and rods .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows an optical micrograph of a typical fiber cross section .",
    "the fiber has an outer diameter of @xmath5 in order to reduce micro - bending deformations at short wavelengths @xcite and it is coated with a standard single layer acrylate coating .",
    "the fluorine - doped regions are of diameter @xmath6 with an index @xmath7 suppressed by @xmath8 relative to the index @xmath9 of silica .",
    "the pitch is @xmath10 and the relative air - hole diameter is @xmath11 .",
    "to facilitate coupling of light to the core region a smf28 was spliced to 200 m of the pcf .",
    "the spectral attenuation was measured by the cut - back technique using a white - light source and an optical spectrum analyzer .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the spectral attenuation of the pcf .",
    "data from otdr measurements at @xmath12 and 1550 nm are also included and good agreement with the cut - back data is observed . cut - back transmission experiments on a short length of pcf have revealed no signatures of high - order modes .",
    "the fiber has a low loss regime at short wavelengths and a regime with high loss above 1000 nm extending to the o - h absorption peak . in order to further analyze the modal properties we have studied the mode - spacing which can be derived from micro - deformation measurements . for a detailed description of the method and the interpretation of experimental data we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows loss spectra ( right axis ) for various periodic micro - deformations and the derived mode - spacings , @xmath13 are also included ( left axis ) .",
    "the figure also includes numerical data calculated with the finite - element method incorporating perfectly matched layers @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in agreement with the experimental observations",
    ", our simulations also suggest that the pcf is broad - band single mode @xcite in the sense that high - order modes have a negligible spacing ( @xmath14 ) to cladding modes .    in order to understand the spacing between",
    "guided modes and cladding modes we apply first - order perturbation theory to the guided modes . treating the absence of fluorine - doping in the core as a perturbation , @xmath15 , we may estimate the shift @xmath13 in mode - index with respect to the cladding modes . from standard perturbation theory ( see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) we get    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the velocity of light , @xmath18 is the unperturbed electrical field , and @xmath19 is the group velocity . for a high - order mode",
    "the field - intensity is strongly suppressed at the center of the core region @xcite and since @xmath20 is not too large the mode has a very small overlap with the region where fluorine is absent .",
    "this results in a negligible increase in effective index @xmath13 with respect to the cladding modes .",
    "in other words , localization in the core is no big energetic advantage for the high - order modes . for the fundamental mode",
    "the situation is opposite since it has a large field - intensity at the center of the core and indeed we find a mode - spacing @xmath13 comparable to @xmath21 .    the mode - spacing picture in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests that the overall loss has little relation to bending - induced scattering loss ( we have also verified this by changing the bending radius @xmath22 ) and since confinement loss can be excluded ( we have verified this numerically ) it is likely that the overall high background originates from various contamination added during the stack - and - pull fabrication process .",
    "we believe that the background loss level can be lowered similarly to the recent achievements in triangular cladding large - mode area pcfs @xcite .",
    "we have studied a new approach to the formation of a core defect in the honeycomb structure by fluorine - doped regions added to the cladding . at sufficiently short wavelengths the cladding states will avoid the fluorine - doped regions and the effective cladding index will in some sense resemble that for a triangular arrangement and light will be confined to the core region where fluorine - doping is absent .",
    "we believe that hybrid cladding designs could be an interesting direction which allows a higher degree of modal / dispersion engineering and the particular structure studied in this paper could also be interesting for photonic band - gap fiber devices employing liquid crystals @xcite .",
