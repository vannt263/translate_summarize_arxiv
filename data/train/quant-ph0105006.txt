    "to be useful , quantum computers will require long coherence time and low error rate . to attain this goal , good design and careful choice of the qubit s operation point are crucial  @xcite .",
    "it is however believed that this will not be enough and that some kind of ` software ' protection will be necessary . to achieve this ,",
    "different strategies have been suggested : quantum error correction  @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces  @xcite and bang - bang control  @xcite .",
    "another approach to minimize the effect of imperfections on the controlled evolution of qubits is to use geometric phases and , in particular , the adiabatic geometric phase ( or berry s phase )  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the dynamic phase , berry s phase does not depend on time but is related to the area enclosed by the system s parameters over a cyclic evolution in parameter space .",
    "it is therefore purely geometric in nature . as a result",
    ", it does not depend on the details of the motion along the path in parameter space : as long as the area is left unchanged the phase is left unchanged by imperfections on the path .",
    "this tolerance to area preserving imperfections has suggested to some authors that berry s phase could be a useful tool for intrinsically fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "for example , from the above argument , one is led to think that berry s phase gates will not be very sensitive to random noise along the path  @xcite .",
    "proposals for the observation and use of this phase for quantum computation have been given for different physical systems  @xcite .",
    "application of the non - abelian geometric phase  @xcite to quantum computation was also the subject of several publications  zanardi:99,duan:2001,choi:2001,faoro:2002 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider another type of geometric phase as a tool for quantum computation : the non - adiabatic , or aharonov - anandan ( aa ) , geometric phase  @xcite . as berry s phase , the aa phase is purely geometric .",
    "it is related to the area enclosed by the state vector in projective space ( see below ) during a cyclic evolution .",
    "one would therefore believe that quantum gates based on this geometric phase also have some built - in tolerance to noise about the path .",
    "the use of this gate as a tool for intrinsically fault - tolerant quantum computation was also recently suggested in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we point out that , when compared to berry s phase , the aa phase seems to have many advantages for quantum computation .",
    "we also discuss quite generally how to monitor this global phase on one qubit using a second qubit .",
    "implementation of the aa phase in a symmetric superconducting charge qubit  @xcite is also discussed .",
    "implementation in other quantum computer architectures is a simple generalization .",
    "the main point of this paper however is to show that the above arguments concerning tolerance to noise do not hold .",
    "logical gates based on this phase are in fact _ more _ affected by random noise in the control parameters than equivalent dynamic gates . by studying the effect of random noise on the qubit s control parameters , we are able to obtain a bound on the value of the phase beyond which the aa phase gate would be advantageous over its dynamical equivalent . in this way , we show that the aa phase is never useful in practice .",
    "this result is confirmed numerically for different noise symmetries .",
    "moreover , using the same analytical and numerical approaches , we point out that quantum gates based on berry s phase are also more affected by fluctuations than their dynamical counterparts .",
    "let us begin by recalling the main ideas related to berry s phase and see what are its drawbacks for quantum computation applications . consider a system whose hamiltonian @xmath0 is controlled by a set of external parameters @xmath1 . upon varying @xmath1 adiabatically ,",
    "if the system is initially in an eigenstate of @xmath2 it will remain in an eigenstate of the instantaneous hamiltonian . moreover , if @xmath2 is non - degenerate on a closed loop @xmath3 in parameter space such that @xmath4 , the final state will differ only by a phase factor from the initial state .",
    "berry has shown that this phase factor has both a dynamic and a geometric contribution , the later depending solely on the loop @xmath3 in parameter space  @xcite .",
    "if the initial state is a superposition of eigenstates @xmath5 of the hamiltonian , each of the eigenstates in the superposition will acquire a berry phase @xmath6 for some real , eigenstate - dependent , phase @xmath7  anandan:87b .",
    "these phases will generally have both dynamic and geometric contributions .",
    "this is not a cyclic evolution of the state vector but this does not lead to any ambiguities since berry s phase is defined over parameter space .",
    "it follows from the above that the application of adiabatic geometric phases to quantum computation has several drawbacks .",
    "first , quantum computers will very likely have a short coherence time . to take full advantage of this short time",
    ", the logic operations should be realized as fast as possible .",
    "the adiabaticity constraint means that berry s phase gates will be slow , thereby reducing the effective quality factor of the quantum computer .",
    "another drawback of the adiabatic phase gate is that during the adiabatic evolution , both geometric and dynamic phases are acquired .",
    "the later is not tolerant to area preserving noise and must be removed .",
    "this could be done using spin - echo like refocusing schemes which require going over the adiabatic evolution twice  @xcite .",
    "however , this further increases the time required to realize a single phase gate and imperfect operation will cause the dynamic phase not to cancel completely , thereby introducing errors .",
    "a third difficulty is that adiabatic geometric phases are only possible if non - trivial loops are available in the space of parameters controlling the qubit s evolution . in other words ,",
    "the single - qubit hamiltonian must be of the form @xmath8 where control over all three ( effective ) fields @xmath9 is possible .",
    "such control is not possible in most of the current proposals for solid - state quantum computer architectures .",
    "control over only two fields , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is usually the norm . in this case , all loops in parameter space are limited to the @xmath12@xmath13 plane and the ( relative ) berry phase is limited to integer multiples of @xmath14 , of no use for computation .",
    "control over fields in all three directions is possible in nmr where berry phase gates have been implemented experimentally  @xcite .",
    "more recently , falci _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have extended the original superconducting charge qubit proposal  @xcite from a symmetric to an asymmetric design to allow a non - zero @xmath15 and therefore non - trivial closed paths in parameter space .",
    "this need for external control of many terms in the single - qubit hamiltonian means additional constraints , experimental difficulties and sources of noise and decoherence .",
    "this is clearly contrary to the efforts now invested in reducing quantum computer design complexity using the approach of encoded universality  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , all of the above issues , namely slow evolution , need for refocusing and control over many effective fields , seem to be resolved when one considers the non - adiabatic generalization of berry s phase : the aharonov - anandan ( aa ) phase .",
    "the latter is introduced by restricting oneself , for a given @xmath0 , to initial states which satisfy @xmath16 for non - adiabatic evolutions , these so - called cyclic initial states  moore:91 are generally not eigenstates of the system s hamiltonian but of the evolution operator .",
    "aharonov and anandan  @xcite have shown that the total phase @xmath17 acquired by such a cyclic initial state in the interval @xmath18 $ ] on which it is cyclic is given by the sum of a dynamic ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 and of a geometric contribution , @xmath21 the latter is the aa phase .",
    "this result is exact , it does not rest on an adiabatic approximation _ but _ , it is restricted to cyclic initial states , for which eq .",
    "( [ cyclic ] ) holds .",
    "the aa phase is not associated to a closed loop in parameter space , as in berry s case , but rather to a closed loop @xmath22 in projective hilbert space @xcite . for a ( pseudo ) spin-1/2 , which is the system of interest for quantum computation , @xmath23 is equal to plus or minus half of the solid angle enclosed by the bloch vector @xmath24 on the bloch sphere .",
    "recall that the bloch vector is defined through the density matrix as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the identity matrix and @xmath27 the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "let us now consider the aa phase as a tool for quantum computation .",
    "the first of the above mentioned issues with the adiabatic phase has already been solved , as the adiabaticity constraint has been relaxed by choosing appropriate cyclic initial states which depend on the particular evolution we are interested in .",
    "the second drawback of the adiabatic phase is solved by choosing evolutions such that @xmath28 at all times . the dynamic contribution ( [ dynamical ] )",
    "is thus zero and only a geometric aa phase is acquired over @xmath22 . for ( [ delta_kernel ] ) to be zero at all time , the axis of rotation must always be orthogonal to the state vector .",
    "the corresponding paths are then spherical polygons where each segment lies along a great circle on the bloch sphere .",
    "it is a clear advantage of the aa phase for computation that such paths exist since there is then no need for cancellation of the dynamic phase using refocusing techniques .    to address the third issue",
    ", we restrict our attention to hamiltonians for which only two control fields are non - zero , @xmath29    ) .",

    "while this final state depends on the aa phase of the evolution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 separately , it is not a cyclic evolution when acting on their superposition .    for the adiabatic ( berry ) phase , a similar situation does not cause any ambiguities .",

    "this situation has suggested to some authors  @xcite that the aa phase is not observable for any evolution on an isolated quantum system .",
    "the reason is that the aa phase is defined only for cyclic evolutions and , since global phase factors are not physical , observable properties are unchanged for such evolutions .",

    "( [ cnot ] ) , it is possible by inspection to ` compile ' the total sequence ( [ evolution ] ) from @xmath83 down to @xmath84 elementary operations .",
    "moreover , one can verify that the dynamic phase cancels in ( [ evolution ] ) .",
    "this therefore corresponds to a purely geometric 2-qubit operation .",
    "this logic gate however involves the application of @xmath84 elementary gates , a number that is quite large for a gate whose purpose is to implement a noiseless  ( geometric ) phase - shift gate .",
    "a central issue to address in a pragmatic way is tolerance to imperfections .",
    "if non - adiabatic geometric logical gates are to be useful for computation , there should be some tolerance to fluctuations in the control parameters .",
    "fluctuations of the control fields will introduce imperfections in the angles and axes of rotation of the gates implementing the geometric evolution .",
    "these imperfections change the overall unitary evolution applied on the qubit and the corresponding final phase may now have a dynamic component .",
    "it is important to note that whether the imperfections affect the dynamic or the geometric component is not relevant for our analysis .",
    "any unwanted phase factor represents an error on the quantum computation . in the following , we thus focus on the errors on the total phase coming from fluctuations in the control parameters around the values that are needed to achieve the desired unitary transformations in the non - fluctuating case .",
    "let us consider first the effect of the simplest of such errors : an error @xmath85 in the angle of the first gate of the sequence  ( [ slice ] ) @xmath86 we do not consider the extra gates ( [ evolution ] ) for the moment .",
    "evidently , this is not an area preserving error and one should not expect the aa phase to be invariant in this circumstance .",
    "however , this is exactly the type of errors which will occur if the control field @xmath87 is fluctuating .    that the non - adiabatic phase gate is not tolerant to this error is easily checked by applying the erroneous sequence ( [ error_slice ] ) on the state @xmath72 to obtain @xmath88the evolution is not cyclic anymore and we can not define the aa phase in this situation ( at least not in the computational basis ) . note that to first order in @xmath89 , the non - cyclicity remains and therefore non - adiabatic phase gates are not tolerant to small imperfections .",
    "small errors can take the state vector out of great circles and bring in a dynamical contribution . in worse cases , as above",

    "it is believed that fluctuations of the control fields are the most damaging sources of noise and decoherence for solid - state qubits  @xcite . for the charge qubit of figure  [ fig_slice]b )",

    "since a qubit has only , by construction , a two - dimensional hilbert space , it is necessary to use more then one qubit to mimic interferometry experiments where more than one degree of freedom of a single particle are used ."

    "<S> we introduce the non - adiabatic , or aharonov - anandan , geometric phase as a tool for quantum computation and show how that phase on one qubit can be monitored by a second qubit without any dynamical contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how that geometric phase could be implemented with superconducting charge qubits . </S>",
    "<S> while the non - adiabatic geometric phase may circumvent many of the drawbacks related to the adiabatic ( berry ) version of geometric gates , we show that the effect of fluctuations of the control parameters on non - adiabatic phase gates is more severe than for the standard dynamic gates . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , fluctuations also affect to a greater extent quantum gates that use the berry phase instead of the dynamic phase . </S>"
