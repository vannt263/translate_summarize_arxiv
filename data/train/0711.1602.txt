    "consider a network which evolves under the removal and addition of vertices . in each unit of time",
    "we add @xmath1 vertex and remove @xmath2 vertices .",
    "removal of a vertex also implies that all the edges incident on that vertex vanish and consequently the degree of vertices at the end of those edges decrease . here",
    "@xmath2 can be interpreted as the ratio of vertices removed to those added , so @xmath3 represents a growing network , @xmath4 a shrinking one , while @xmath5 implies vertex turnover but fixed network size .",
    "the equations to follow represent the completely general case .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper we will specialize to networks of constant size as we assume that the network already exists and we would like to preserve its original structure , by balancing the rate of attack against the rate of repair .",
    "let @xmath6 be the fraction of nodes in the network that at a given time have degree @xmath7 . by definition",
    "then it has the normalization :    @xmath8    in addition to this we would like to have freedom over the degree of the incoming vertex .",
    "let @xmath9 be the probability distribution governing this , with the constraint @xmath10 .",
    "we also have to consider how a newly arriving vertex chooses to attach to other vertices extant in the network and how a vertex is removed from the same .",
    "let @xmath11 be the probability that a given edge from a new node is connected to a node of degree @xmath7 , multiplied by the total number of nodes @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath12 is the probability that an edge from a new node is connected to some node of degree @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath13 be the probability that a given node with degree @xmath7 fails or is attacked during one node removal also multiplied by @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath14 is the total probability to remove a node with degree @xmath7 during one node removal .",
    "note that the introduction of the deletion kernel @xmath13 is what sets our model apart from previous models describing the network evolution process .",
    "since each newly attached edge goes to some vertex with degree @xmath7 , we have the following normalization conditions : @xmath15      armed with the given definitions and building on the work done previously by  @xcite , we are now in a position to write down a rate equation governing the evolution of the degree distribution . for a network of @xmath0 nodes at a given unit of time ,",
    "the total number of nodes with degree @xmath7 is @xmath16 .",
    "after one unit of time we add one vertex and take away @xmath2 vertices , so the number is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the new value of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore we have , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the conditional probability of following an edge from a node of degree @xmath21 and reaching a node of degree @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , it is the degree distribution of nodes at the end of an edge emanating from a node of degree @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are always zero , and for an uncorrelated network , @xmath24 .",
    "the terms involving @xmath11 describe the flow of vertices with degree @xmath25 to @xmath7 and @xmath7 to @xmath26 as a consequence of edges gained due to the addition of new vertices .",
    "the first two terms involving @xmath27 describes the flow of vertices with degree @xmath28 to @xmath7 and @xmath7 to @xmath25 as vertices lose edges as a result of losing neighbors .",
    "the term @xmath29 represents the direct removal of a node of degree @xmath7 at rate @xmath2 .",
    "finally @xmath9 represents the addition of a vertex with degree @xmath7 .",
    "processes where vertices gain or lose two or more edges vanish in the limit of large @xmath0 and are not included in eq .  .",
    "the rate equation described above presents a formidable challenge due to the appearance of @xmath20 from the terms representing deleted edges from lost neighbors .",
    "rate equations for recovery schemes based on edge rewiring are slightly easier to deal with . upon failure , all edges connected to that node",
    "are rewired so that the degrees of the deleted node s neighbors do not change , and this term does not appear .",
    "the specific case of preferential failure in power - law networks was considered previously in this context by  @xcite . however , this recovery protocol can only be used on strictly growing networks , because a network of constant size would become dense under its application .",
    "moreover , it is dependent on the power - law structure of the network .",
    "the methods described here are general and are applicable to arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "apart from edge rewiring , the special case of random deletion also leads to a significant simplification .",
    "uniform deletion amounts to setting @xmath30 .",
    "doing so , then leads to the following , @xmath31 which renders eq .",
    "independent of @xmath32 and thus independent of any degree - degree correlations .",
    "random deletion hence closes equation   for @xmath33 , enabling us to seek a solution for the degree distribution for a given @xmath34 and @xmath11 . with non - uniform deletion ,",
    "the degree distribution depends on a two - point probability distribution , and as we shall see in section  [ sec : correlations ] , the two - point probability distribution will depend on the three - point probability distribution and so on .",
    "this hierarchy of distributions , where the @xmath0-point distribution depends on the @xmath35-point distribution , is not closed under non - uniform failure and hence it is difficult to seek an exact solution for the degree distribution .",
    "nevertheless , in the following , we demonstrate a method that allows us to navigate our way around this problem .    as mentioned before , for the purposes of this paper we will be interested in a network of constant size , where the rate of attack is compensated by the rate of repair . assuming that the network reaches ( or already is ) a stationary distribution and does not possess degree - degree correlations , we set @xmath5 and can further simplify eq .  .",
    "let @xmath36 be the mean degree of nodes removed from the network ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 the mean degree of the original degree distribution @xmath33 .",
    "then we have , @xmath39 the evolution process , specifically non - uniform removal of nodes , can and in many cases will introduce degree - degree correlations into our networks . in order to confront this issue",
    ", we will first find choices for @xmath9 and @xmath40 that satisfy the solutions to the rate equation , for a given @xmath6 , in a network that is uncorrelated .",
    "we will then demonstrate that a special subset of those solutions for @xmath34 and @xmath11 is an uncorrelated fixed point of the rate equation for the degree - degree correlations .",
    "this opens up the possibility , that a network that initially has no degree - degree correlations will not develop correlations from the evolution process .",
    "although the rate equation described in eq .",
    "is fairly complicated , it is a relatively straightforward exercise to determine the relation between edges added to those removed . multiplying eq .   by @xmath7 , summing over @xmath7 and rearranging yields @xmath41 .",
    "this equation is simple to interpret .",
    "since the network has a constant fixed - point degree distribution , the average degree of the network remains constant , and therefore edges are removed and added at the the same rate .",
    "in this section we describe our method under which networks can recover from various forms of attack . the types of attack we consider are those studied generally by most authors ( though in static networks ) , namely preferential and targeted attacks .",
    "random failures are the most generally studied schemes in both static and evolving networks , in view of the fact that they lend themselves to relatively simple analysis .",
    "these types of failures may be representative , say , of disruption of power lines or transformers in a power grid owing to extraneous factors such as weather .",
    "however , the functionality of most networks often depends on the performance of higher degree nodes , consequently non - uniform attack schemes focus on these .",
    "for example , in a peer - to - peer network , a high degree node could be a central user with large amounts of data .",
    "high degree could also be indicative of the amount of load on a node during its operation , or on the public visibility of a person in a social network .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that a malicious entity such as a computer virus is more likely to strike these important nodes .",
    "et al _  @xcite have employed this removal strategy ( among others ) on a variety of simulated and real networks and have found it to be highly effective in disrupting the structure of the attacked network .",
    "nodes ) with mean @xmath42 , under preferential attack @xmath43 and uniform attachment @xmath44 using @xmath45.,width=302 ]    we simulate these kinds of attacks using preferential failure @xmath43 , that sample nodes in proportion to their number of connections , and through an outright attack on the highest degree nodes represented by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the heaviside step function .",
    "our method of compensation will involve control over two processes : the first where our newly incoming / repaired vertex chooses a degree for itself drawn from some distribution @xmath9 , and second , the process by which this vertex decides to attach to any other vertex in the network , governed by the attachment kernel @xmath40 .",
    "our goal here is to solve for the attachment kernel @xmath11 , that will preserve the original probability distribution @xmath33 , subject to a deletion kernel @xmath13 for some choice of @xmath34 .",
    "we will assume that the final network is uncorrelated and work with eq .",
    ", keeping in mind that any arbitrary choice of @xmath34 and @xmath11 is probably not consistent with that assumption .    introducing the cumulative distribution for the attacked and newly added vertices , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , @xmath50 we sum eq .   from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , noting that @xmath41 for our steady state network .",
    "this leads to the following relation , @xmath53 dividing both sides by @xmath33 gives us an expression for the attachment kernel , @xmath54 .",

    "the correct choice of solution from the above set , must obey the consistency condition , that when inserted into the rate equation for the degree - degree correlations , the correlations vanish . in section  [ sec : correlations ] , we will show that the following _ ansatz _ chosen from the above set is such a choice : @xmath56 equation   was previously derived by  @xcite for the case of random deletion .",
    "here we posit that it works more generally for the case of non - uniform attack when our initial network is uncorrelated ( with some caveats that will be explained shortly ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath11 makes intuitive sense because the quantity @xmath57 is the probability distribution governing the number of edges belonging to a node , reached by following a randomly chosen edge to one of its ends , _ not including _ the edge that was followed .",
    "this is one less than the total degree of the node and is also referred to as the _ excess _ degree distribution .",
    "note that in our model we specify the degree of incoming nodes .",
    "therefore the appearance of the excess degree distribution is a signature of an uncorrelated network , implying the newly arriving edges are being introduced in an uncorrelated fashion .",
    "there are basically two conditions for the existence of a solution given by eq .  ; @xmath58 must be a valid probability distribution , and @xmath38 must be finite .",
    "these are not very stringent conditions and are typically satisfied by most degree distributions . in other words , barring some pathological cases , it is always possible to find a solution of the form of eq .  .",
    "there is an additional consideration , the deletion process may lead to nodes of degree zero in a network that originally did not have any such nodes . while the fraction of such nodes is vanishingly small for networks with say , poisson degree distributions , they may be non - trivial for power - law networks .",
    "as such , it is important to set @xmath59 ( the probability to attach to a node of degree zero ) to a generous value in order to reconnect these nodes to the network .",
    "we are now in a position to effect our repair on the network .",
    "given the original degree distribution @xmath6 and the form of the attack @xmath13 , eq .",
    "gives us the precise recipe for recovering the degree distribution .",
    "we need to sample the degrees of the newly introduced nodes in proportion to the product of the deletion kernel _ and _ the degree distribution , and then attach these edges in proportion to the excess degree distribution of the network . to test our repair method , we provide four examples for initially uncorrelated networks with @xmath60 nodes generated using the _ configuration model _  @xcite . in the configuration model ,",

    "our first example network has links distributed according to a power - law with an exponential cutoff ,    @xmath69    @xmath70 is a normalization constant which in this case is @xmath71 , where the function @xmath72 is the poly - logarithm function defined as : @xmath73 the exponential cut - off has been introduced for three reasons .",
    "first , many real world networks appear to show this cutoff  @xcite and second , it renders the distribution normalizable for ranges of the exponent @xmath74 .",
    "finally , for a pure power - law network it is in principle possible to assign a degree to a node that is greater than the system size .",
    "the exponential cutoff ensures that the probability for this to happen is vanishingly small . in the other examples that we consider",
    ", the functional form of the distribution already ensures this property .",
    "the second network has an exponential distribution given by , @xmath75    fig .",
    "[ fig : exptheta ] shows the results for the exponentially distributed network ( @xmath61 ) undergoing targeted attack . in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerpref ] we show the resulting degree distribution for the power - law network ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) where nodes were attacked preferentially .",
    "both figures indicate the initial and final networks are in excellent agreement .    at this point , aside from the technical details , it is worth reminding ourselves of the big picture .",
    "we have demonstrated above that if a network with a certain degree structure is subjected to an attack that aims to destabilize that structure , one can recover the same , by manipulating the rules by which vertices are introduced to the network .",
    "the rules that we employ in our repair method are dependent on the types of attacks that our networks are subject to . in the following section we give a detailed justification of the employment of our method .      in order for our results from the previous sections to be valid",
    ", we must demonstrate that our initially uncorrelated networks remain uncorrelated under our repair scheme . to accomplish this",
    ", we will define a rate equation for the degree - degree correlations and demonstrate that the uncorrelated network is a fixed point of this equation .",
    "our rate equation will describe the evolution of the expected number of edges in the network with ends of degree @xmath7 and @xmath76 .",
    "let the expected number of such edges in the network be , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the probability that a randomly selected edge has degree @xmath7 at one end and degree @xmath76 in the other .",
    "the expected number of edges after one time step where we add @xmath80 and take away @xmath81 edges is then , @xmath82 e'_{l , k } = m e_{l , k } + \\delta , \\label{eq : edgerate1}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 represents all other edge addition and removal processes .",
    "we have already established that in the steady state case , @xmath84 irrespective of the degree distribution , so our goal is equivalent to showing that @xmath83 is equal to zero for an uncorrelated network generated / repaired with our special choices of @xmath11 and @xmath34 . as a result @xmath85 , implying that the degree - degree correlations ( if any ) remain constant over time .",
    "we will assume that our network is locally tree - like , something which holds true for most random graphs .",
    "in addition we will only consider processes out to second nearest - neighbors of a node .",
    "these assumptions allows us to avoid including terms in the rate equation representing removal of nodes with neighbors that are connected to each other .",
    "nevertheless , there are a large number of remaining processes that we will need to consider .",
    "to start things off , note that the rate equation is symmetric in the indices @xmath76 and @xmath7 .",
    "any process that contributes to changing @xmath7 while holding @xmath76 constant also contributes to changing @xmath76 while holding @xmath7 constant .",
    "we can therefore consider contributions to @xmath83 from @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and add on the corresponding symmetric terms at the end .",
    "the first process we need to take into account is a direct addition of a node of degree @xmath76 .",
    "this contributes two flows to the rate equation , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , the direct deletion of a node of degree @xmath76 contributes @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "next , we will have to take into account second nearest - neighbor processes .",
    "we can be certain that these terms are of the same order by merely counting the number of unsummed probability distributions that go into each process .",
    "there will be two terms for the attachment process representing the situation where a new node of any degree attaches to a node of degree @xmath7 or @xmath25 , that was previously attached to a node of degree @xmath76 .",
    "these terms are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "similarly there are two removal processes , where a node of any degree that is removed from the network was previously attached to a node of degree @xmath7 or @xmath28 that has neighbor(s ) of degree @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately these terms introduce three - point correlations into the rate equation .",
    "analogous to methods employed in similar hierarchy problems , we use a moment - closure approximation to represent these processes as a product of two two - point correlations in the following manner , @xmath95    adding all of these terms together our final equation for @xmath83 is , @xmath96 in addition to terms where @xmath76 and @xmath7 are interchanged .    after inserting the appropriate @xmath11 and @xmath34 from eq .",
    "along with the uncorrelated solution @xmath97 , it can be shown that , @xmath98 according to eq .",
    ", there exist a set of solutions such that an initially uncorrelated network will not develop any degree - degree correlations as a consequence of the evolution process .",
    "the attachment kernel that was employed in the network evolution process , described in section  [ sec : designattachment ] , was a subset of these solutions .",
    "this allowed the repair method to be employed by maintaining negligible correlations in the network .",
    "one must point out , that we have not explicitly demonstrated the stability of the uncorrelated solution to perturbations .",
    "for example fluctuations in @xmath87 or in the number of edges may drive the network away from the uncorrelated steady - state . an analytical approach to determine this , say using linear stability analysis is difficult , due to the numerous related probability distributions involved .",
    "so instead we resort to a numerical approach .",
    "we measured the pearson correlation coefficient between the degrees of nodes at both ends of an edge for all our model networks . for the poisson and exponential cases",
    ", the correlations remained negligible during the evolution process .",
    "on the other hand , the power - law network developed non - trivial correlations .",
    "we have not been able to determine whether the appearance of these correlations was due to finite - size effects , or instability in the uncorrelated solution , or to some other cause .",
    "the results show that the agreement between the initial and final degree distributions is very good , and it seems that in this particular case , the correlations did not demonstrate a significant effect on the final state of the network .",
    "in this paper , we have shown how to preserve a network s degree distribution from various forms of attack or failures by allowing it to adapt via the simple manipulation of rules that govern the introduction of nodes and edges .",
    "we based our analysis on a rate equation describing the evolution of the network under arbitrary schemes of addition and deletion .",
    "in addition to choosing the degree of incoming nodes , we allow ourselves to choose how nodes attach to the existing network . to deal with the special case of non - uniform deletion",
    "we have introduced a rate equation for the evolution of degree - degree correlations and have used that in combination with the equation for the degree distribution to come to our solution .",
    "we have provided examples of the applicability of this method using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations on a variety of degree distributions , yielding excellent results in each case .",
    "the structure of many networks in the real world is crucially related to their performance .",
    "many authors have seized on the fact that technological networks such as the internet and peer - to - peer networks are power - law in nature , and have used this to design efficient search schemes among other things .",
    "loss of structural properties of these networks then lead to severe constraints on their performance .",
    "recent empirical studies  @xcite have suggested that node removal , for example , in the world wide web , is typically non - uniform in nature . in view of this , it is crucial for researchers to come up with effective solutions to try and manage these types of disruptions . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is a considerable gap in understanding the non - uniform deletion process of nodes and edges and corresponding methods to deal with them .",
    "this paper begins to address this gap .",
    "it must be pointed out that the methods we have described depends crucially on the assumption of negligible correlations as the network evolves . curiously enough , in our example power - law network , we were able to get very good agreement between the initial and final degree distributions , in spite of the appearance of non - trivial correlations .",
    "it will certainly be interesting to see if our methods can be extended to the case of networks with strong correlations , and other metrics describing network structure .",
    "perhaps it is possible to directly confront the rate equation for the degree - degree correlations , although this seems a difficult prospect at the moment .",
    "the idea of preserving the structure of networks from attacks by allowing it to react in real - time is a relatively nascent one and the authors look forward to more developments in this area ."
