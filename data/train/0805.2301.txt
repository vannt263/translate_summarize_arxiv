    ", we will develop an approximative framework for neutrino oscillations with so - called nonstandard interactions ( nsis ) as such subleading effects .",
    "this framework is derived in the limit when the small mass - squared difference is negligible , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 , as well as when the effective matter interaction part of the hamiltonian has only one eigenvalue significantly different from zero",
    ". the main effects of nsis will be parametrized by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which will be defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoflavor ] .",
    "recently , nsis with matter have attracted a lot of attention in the literature . in some sense",
    ", the potential for these interactions can be viewed as a generalization of the coherent forward - scattering potential , which describes the effects of ordinary ( or standard ) interactions with matter @xcite , and indeed , gives rise to the famous mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite .",
    "especially interesting are approximative frameworks that consider neutrino oscillations with nsis which could be used for atmospheric neutrino data in the @xmath3-@xmath4 sector , since these data are sensitive to interactions of tau neutrinos @xcite . however , there are also other experimental situations , where one could investigate tau neutrino interactions such as with the minos experiment @xcite . in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have studied an approximative two - flavor neutrino scenario that is similar to our framework , but instead used for the opera experiment .",
    "nevertheless , one should be aware of the fact that nsi effects are subleading effects and have been experimentally constrained @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsi ] , we present the general scheme for three - flavor neutrino oscillations including nsis . next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoflavor ] , we develop an approximative two - flavor neutrino oscillation framework including subleading nsi effects as well as we compare our framework with earlier results .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : numerics ] , we analyze our framework numerically . in sec .",

    "standard three - flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be described by the following hamiltonian in flavor basis : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the neutrino energy , @xmath7 is the mass - squared difference between the @xmath8th and @xmath9th mass eigenstate , and @xmath10 is the leptonic mixing matrix . by adding the effective matter hamiltonian @xmath11 to the vacuum hamiltonian @xmath12 , standard matter effects on neutrino oscillations can be studied . in order to investigate the effects of nsis between neutrinos and other fermions , another more general effective interaction hamiltonian can be added .",
    "this effective hamiltonian will be of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 is the number of fermions of type @xmath16 , and we have assumed an unpolarized medium .",
    "thus , the full hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 which describes three - flavor neutrino oscillations in matter including nsis .",
    "since the experimental bounds on @xmath18 and @xmath19 are relatively stringent @xcite , we focus on the case where the interaction part of the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath20 where the unitary matrix @xmath21 defines the matter interaction eigenstates , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the standard msw potential . in this framework , the nsis are parametrized by the two matter interaction eigenvalues @xmath1 and @xmath25 as well as the matter interaction basis parameters @xmath2 and @xmath26 and we have @xmath27 thus , the standard neutrino oscillation framework is recovered with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    from the results of atmospheric neutrino experiments , we know that even high - energy @xmath3 oscillate , leading to @xmath30 @xcite for the matter composition of the earth .",
    "we will here consider the limit @xmath31 , which is the applicable limit for standard neutrino oscillations with energies of a few gev to tens of gev inside the earth , while earlier papers @xcite have studied the limit @xmath32 . in the limit of @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", the full three - flavor hamiltonian takes the form ( up to an irrelevant addition proportional to unity ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the third column of the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath10 and first column of the matter interaction mixing matrix @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "since this hamiltonian is defined using only two linearly independent vectors , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , there must be a third linearly independent vector @xmath40 for which @xmath41 and which is orthogonal to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the components of this vector are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a normalization factor with @xmath44 and we have introduced the product @xmath45 which is orthogonal to both @xmath46 and @xmath47 as well as antilinear in both arguments . with our parametrization , we have @xmath48 since @xmath40 is an eigenvector of the full hamiltonian regardless of the matter density , its evolution decouples from that of the other two states and it will only receive a phase factor .",
    "thus , it will be possible to describe the evolution of the two remaining states in an effective two - flavor framework .",
    "indeed , if we choose the basis @xmath49 ( note that @xmath50 is already normalized as @xmath39 and @xmath40 are orthonormal ) , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 chosen such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are real , then the two - flavor hamiltonian in this basis takes the form @xmath55 which is an ordinary two - flavor hamiltonian in matter with the vacuum mixing angle @xmath56 , the mass - squared difference @xmath57 , and the msw potential @xmath58 . in order to compute the neutrino flavor evolution in this basis ,",
    "any method applicable to two - flavor neutrino oscillations can be used .",
    "while the above framework makes it easy to reduce the three - flavor evolution to a two - flavor evolution in the given basis , the final results have to be projected onto the flavor basis , where @xmath59 the two bases are related by a unitary matrix @xmath24 , which is given by @xmath60 with this notation and the full evolution matrix given by @xmath61 in the @xmath62 basis , the general neutrino oscillation probability becomes @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\      & & + 2 \\operatorname{re}\\left [          v_{\\beta0}v_{\\alpha 0}^ * e^{-{{\\rm i}}\\phi }          \\sqrt{p_{xy}}(v_{\\beta x}^ * v_{\\alpha y }      e^{{{\\rm i}}\\lambda_y } - v_{\\beta y}^ * v_{\\alpha x } e^{-{{\\rm i}}\\lambda_y } ) \\right ]          \\nonumber \\\\      & &          + 2 \\operatorname{re}\\left [          p_{xx } v_{\\beta x } v_{\\alpha x}^ * v_{\\beta y}^ *      v_{\\alpha y } e^{-2{{\\rm i}}\\lambda_x } - p_{xy } v_{\\beta x } v_{\\alpha      y}^ * v_{\\beta y}^ * v_{\\alpha x } e^{-2{{\\rm i}}\\lambda_y } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      & &          + 2 \\sqrt{p_{xx}p_{xy } } \\operatorname{re}\\left [          v_{\\beta x } v_{\\beta y}^ * (          |v_{\\alpha y}|^2 - |v_{\\alpha x}|^2          ) e^{-{{\\rm i}}(\\lambda_x+\\lambda_y ) }          \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      & &          + 2 \\sqrt{p_{xx}p_{xy } } \\operatorname{re}\\left [          v_{\\alpha x}^ * v_{\\alpha y } (          |v_{\\beta x}|^2 - |v_{\\beta y}|^2          ) e^{-{{\\rm i}}(\\lambda_x-\\lambda_y ) }          \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( with this notation @xmath66 is the two - flavor survival probability and @xmath67 is the two - flavor transition probability ) .    from the above , it becomes apparent that the final neutrino oscillation probabilities are quite complicated unless further assumptions are made .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that it is necessary to project the evolution matrix onto the flavor basis .",

    ". we have assumed gaussian priors of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 at a 90  % confidence level.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    while the sensitivity contours are symmetric around @xmath145 when not including nsis ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath146 ) , they extend to smaller values of @xmath124 and larger values of @xmath57 when nsis are included ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath100 ) .",
    "the conclusion that the sensitivity contours will extend to smaller @xmath124 and larger @xmath57 is general and apparent from the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : oureffdm ] ) and ( [ eq : ourefftheta ] ) , where the same @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be achieved for a class of different @xmath124 and @xmath57 given by @xmath149 in the case when @xmath97 .",
    "this degeneracy has also been marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : s23dm2fig ] for @xmath124 and @xmath150 equal to the simulated values when @xmath68 .      another interesting question in relation to nsis and future experiments is what the experimental sensitivity to nsis is , _",
    "e.g. _ , what bounds the experiments could put on the nsi parameters . thus , in fig .  [",
    "fig : nsifig ] , we show the sensitivity contours in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane ( the other nsi parameters have been marginalized ) corresponding to the @xmath3 disappearance channel at a neutrino factory described above .     and",
    "@xmath2 for the @xmath3 disappearance channel at the fictive neutrino factory experiment described in the text .",
    "the dashed curves are the systematics - only sensitivities and the solid curves include parameter correlations with the standard neutrino oscillation parameters ( with errors comparable to the current errors ) .",
    "the contours were constructed assuming no nsis and the @xmath151 corresponds to this situation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    from this figure , we notice that the given experiment is not very sensitive to the nsi parameters as long as the knowledge on the standard neutrino oscillation parameters has errors which are comparable to those of the current experimental bounds .",
    "essentially , for large @xmath1 ( such that the entire energy spectrum is well above resonance ) , the bound on @xmath2 comes from the mismatch between the effective @xmath147 and @xmath148 measured by the neutrino factory and the external measurements on @xmath124 and @xmath150 and the errors of both are propagated to the error in the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "however , if the external errors on the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities are very small ( _ i.e. _ , such that we do not need to consider correlations with the standard parameters ) , then the bounds on the nsi parameters are significantly improved .",
    "it should be noted that the insensitivity to @xmath2 for small @xmath152 is clearly due to the fact that it is not possible to determine @xmath2 when the interaction effects are suppressed .",
    "we should also note that the given experiment is clearly not the best to use in order to distinguish nsis from standard neutrino oscillations .",
    "for example , it should be more viable to detect nsis through other oscillation channels or through the combination of the @xmath3 disappearance channel with one of the appearance channels .",
    "we have considered the effects of nsis on the propagation of @xmath153  gev neutrinos in the earth with the assumption that @xmath81 is small and that @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 are the only important nsi parameters .",
    "we have shown that , if the nsi parameters are constrained to be on the `` atmospheric parabola , '' then the neutrino flavor evolution matrix can be straightforwardly computed using a simple two - flavor scenario in matter with a mixing angle given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : twoflavormix ] ) .",
    "this two - flavor scenario is the natural nsi extension of the usual two - flavor approximation used in standard neutrino oscillations when @xmath93 is small .",
    "while this two - flavor scenario , unlike the standard two - flavor scenario , is not diagonal in flavor space , it should be noted that if nsi effects are present in the propagation , then they should also be present in the creation and detection processes , meaning that the actual flavor space is no longer equivalent to the weak interaction flavor space .",
    "deviations from the atmospheric parabola or other nsi parameters can be easily treated as a perturbation to the two - flavor scenario .",
    "the impact of nsis on neutrino oscillations in the earth as well as the accuracy of our two - flavor approximation have been studied using neutrino oscillograms of the earth .",
    "it was noted that the resonance regions in the neutrino survival channels are mainly dependent on the mixing angle of the effective two - flavor scenario , implying a degeneracy between @xmath80 and the nsi angle @xmath2 .",
    "this degeneracy is preferentially broken by using data from above or below the resonance , or by studying the flavor combination into which neutrinos actually oscillate .    finally , we have given an example of the impact of the nsis in a fictive neutrino factory with a baseline of @xmath157  km studying the muon neutrino disappearance channel .",
    "we have shown that the degeneracy between the standard and nsi parameters extends in the expected direction and computed the actual sensitivity to the nsi parameters , both by assuming no degeneracy with the standard parameters ( _ i.e. _ , the standard parameters assumed to be exactly known ) and by assuming correlations with the standard parameters ( in this case , gaussian priors with a size corresponding to the current experimental errors were used ) .",
    "again , it should be stressed that this part is only intended to show the impact of the nsi parameters in a fictive experiment and does not offer a realistic approach for searching for nsis .",
