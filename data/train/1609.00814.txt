    "in this paper , the novel statistical problem of deriving asymptotic results for nested random sequences of statistical descriptors for data in a non - euclidean space is considered .",

    ", nestedness considerably complicates design of descriptors and , to the best knowledge of the authors , has hindered any asymptotic theory to date .    for dimension reduction of non - euclidean data ,",
    "_ procrustes analysis _ by @xcite and later _ principal geodesic analysis _ by @xcite are approaches to mimic pca on shape spaces and riemannian manifolds , respectively .",
    "both build on the concept of a frchet mean , a minimizer of expected squared distance , around which classical pca is conducted for the data mapped to a suitable tangent space .",
    "asymptotics for such means have been subsequently provided , among others , by @xcite , allowing for inferential methods such as two - sample tests .",
    "asymptotics for these _ tangent space pca _ methods , however , reflecting the _ forward nestedness _ due to random basepoints ( i.e. corresponding means ) of tangent spaces with random pcs therein , remain open to date",
    ".    moreover , these tangent space pca methods are in no way canonical",
    ". not only may statistical outcomes depend on specific choices of tangent space coordinates , more severely , given curvature , no tangent space coordinates can correctly reflect mutual data distances . for this reason , among others , _ geodesic principal component analysis _",
    "( gpca ) has been introduced by @xcite , _ iterated frame bundle development _ by @xcite and _ barycentric subspaces _ by @xcite . as the following example teaches ,",
    "nestedness may be lost .",
    "[ intro.ex ] consider data on a two - sphere that is confined to its equator and nearly uniformly spread out on it .",
    "then the best @xmath0 approximating geodesic is the equator and far away there are two ( due to symmetry ) intrinsic frchet means , each close to one of the poles , see @xcite .",
    "let us now detail our ideas , first by elucidating the following .",
    "* classical pca from a geometric perspective . * given data on @xmath1 , for every @xmath2 a unique affine subspace @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 is determined by equivalently minimizing residual sums of squares or , among those containing the classical mean @xmath5 , maximizing the projected variance .",
    "also equivalently , these subspaces have representations as @xmath6 , the affine translates of spans from an eigenvector decomposition @xmath7 of the data s covariance matrix with descending eigenvalues . in consequence ,",
    "one may either start from the zero dimensional mean and subsequently add most descriptive dimensions ( forward ) or start from the full dimensional space and remove least descriptive dimensions ( backward ) to obtain the same forward and backward nested sequence of subspaces @xmath8 for non - euclidean data , due to failure of pythagoras theorem , this canonical decomposition of data variance is no longer possible . for a detailed discussion see @xcite .",
    "* nestedness of non - euclidean pca * is highly desirable , when due to curvature and data spread , intrinsic frchet means are away from the data .",
    "for instance in example [ intro.ex ] , in order to have a mean on the equator , also in this case , @xcite devised _ principal arc analysis _ with the _ backward nested mean _ confined to the best approximating circle .",
    "this method and its generalization _ backward nested sphere analysis _ ( pns ) by @xcite give a tool for descriptive shape analysis that often strikingly outperforms tangent space pca , e.g. @xcite .",
    "here , the data space is a unit sphere @xmath9 of dimension @xmath10 , say , and in each of the @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional ( small ) subsphere for pns and for _ principal nested great spheres _ ( pngs ) it is a @xmath4-dimensional great subsphere . in passing we",
    "note that pns is _ higher dimensional _ in the sense of having higher dimensional descriptor spaces than classical pca and pngs which are equally high dimensional , cf .",
    "@xcite .    to date",
    ", however , there is no asymptotic theory for pns available , in particular there are no inferential tools for backward nested means , say .",
    "asymptotic results for non - data space valued descriptors , geodesics , say , are only available for single descriptors ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that are directly defined as minimizers , not indirectly as a nested sequence of minimizers .    *",
    "challenges for and results of this paper . *",
    "it is the objective of this paper to close this gap by providing asymptotic results for rather general random _",
    "backward nested families of descriptors _ ( bnfds ) on rather general spaces .",
    "the challenge here is that random objects that are constrained by other random objects are to be investigated , requiring an elaborate setup . into this setup",
    ", we translate strong consistency arguments of @xcite and @xcite , and introducing a _ constrained _ m - estimation technique , we show joint asymptotic normality of an entire bnfd . in the special case of nested subspaces , bnfds may terminate at any dimension and @xmath11 is not required .    as we minimize a functional under the constraining conditions that other functionals are minimized as well , our approach can be called _ constrained m - estimation_. in the literature , this term _ constrained m - estimation _ has been independently introduced by @xcite who robustify m - estimators by introducing constraining conditions and by @xcite , who consider m - estimators that are confined to closed subsets of a euclidean space with specifically regular boundaries .",
    "it seems that our m - estimation problem , which is constrained to satisfying other m - estimation problems has not been dealt with before .",
    "we solve it using a random lagrange multiplier approach .",
    "furthermore , in order to obtain asymptotic normality of each single sequence element , in particular for the last , we require the rather technical concept of _ factoring charts_. our very general setup will be illustrated , still with some effort , by example of pns , pngs and the _ intrinsic mean on a first geodesic principal component _ ( imo1gpc ) .    in order to exploit nested asymptotic normality for a _ nested two - sample test _ , we utilize bootstrapping techniques . while for frchet means",
    ", as they are descriptors assuming values in the data space , one can explicitly model the dependence of the random base points of the tangent spaces as in @xcite , so that suitable statistics can be accordingly directly approximated , this modeling and approximation can be avoided using the bootstrap as in @xcite . for our application at hand , as data space and descriptor space are different , we can not approximate the distribution of random descriptors and we fall back on the bootstrap .    * suggestions for live imaging of stem cell differentiation . * after illustrations of our nested two - sample test by simulations for pns and pngs ,",
    "we apply it to a cutting edge application in adult human stem cell differentiation research .",
    "`` rooted in a line of experimentation originating in the 1960s '' ( from @xcite ) , the promise that stem cells taken from a patient s bone marrow may be used to rebuild specific , previously lost , patient s tissue is currently undergoing an abundance of clinical trials .",
    "although the underlying mechanisms are , to date , not fully understood , it is common knowledge that early stem cell differentiation is triggered by biomechanical cues , e.g. @xcite , which result in specific ordering of the cellular _ actin - myosin filament skeleton_. in collaboration with the third institute of physics at the university of gttingen we map fluorescence images of cell structures to two - spheres , where each point stands for a specific ordering . with our 2d pngs two - sample test",
    "we can track the direction of increased ordering over the first 24 hours .",
    "we find , however , a consistent reversal of ordering between hours 16 to 20 which hint toward the effect of cell division .",
    "this effect suggests that the commonly used time point of 24 hours for fixated hmscs imaging , e.g. as in @xcite , may not be ideal for cell differentiation detection .",
    "in fact , our method can be used to direct more elaborate and refined imaging techniques , such as time resolved in - vivo cell imaging , using @xcite , say , to investigate specifically discriminatory time intervals in detail .    *",
    "we conclude our introduction * by noting that our setup of bnfds has a canonical form on a riemannian manifold with @xmath3 in ( [ backward - nested - subspaces : eq ] ) being a totally geodesic submanifold , not necessarily of codimension one in @xmath12 , however .",
    "for example for kendall s shape spaces @xmath13 which is a complex projective space of real dimension @xmath14 , cf .",
    "@xcite , we have a sequence of @xmath15 where the numbers below the inclusions denote the corresponding co - dimensions .    more generally , we believe that our setup can be generalized to riemann stratified spaces . for example , ( [ nested - shape - spaces : eq ] ) generalizes at once to @xmath16 ( the shape space of @xmath17-dimensional @xmath18 landmark configurations which has dimension @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 , cf .",
    "@xcite , now with @xmath21 indeed , in section [ scn : kendalls - shape - spaces ] we illustrate the generalization to the sequence @xmath22 , giving the imo1gpc for arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "our setup may also generalize to phylogenetic tree spaces as introduced by @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite , or torus - pca and the more general polysphere - pca , cf .",
    "moreover , our setup may be applied to flags of barycentric subspaces as introduced by @xcite .    *",
    "our paper is organized as follows . * in the following section we introduce the abstract setup of bnfds and show that the essential assumptions are fulfilled for pns , pngs and imo1gpcs for riemannian manifolds and kendall s shape spaces . in the section to follow we will develop a set of assumptions necessary for the main results on asymptotic strong consistency and normality which are stated in section [ main - results : scn ] . also in section [ main - results : scn ] ,",
    "we give our nested bootstrap two - sample test .",
    "the elaborate proof of asymptotic strong consistency is deferred to the appendix . in section",
    "[ application : scn ] we show simulations and our applications to stem cell differentiation .",
    "in this section we first introduce the general framework including the fundamental assumption of _ factoring charts _ which is essential to prove asymptotic normality of single nested descriptors in section [ main - results : scn ] .",
    "then we give examples : the intrinsic mean on a first geodesic principal component ( imo1gpc ) for riemannian manifolds , principal nested spheres ( pns ) as well as principal nested great spheres ( pngs ) and finally we give an example for the imo1gpcs also on non - manifold kendall s shape spaces .",
    "the first example is rather straightforward , the last is slightly more involved and the second and third are much more involved . the differential geometry used here can be found in any standard textbook , e.g. @xcite .",
    "first , let us quickly sketch the ideas in case of imo1gpcs on a riemannian manifold @xmath23 .",
