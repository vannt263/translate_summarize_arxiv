    "fundamental string effects are most important near the planck scale , thus it seems that early cosmology will be the most likely area to test string theory .",
    "the classical and quantum string dynamics and their associated effects in a wide class of string backgrounds ( conformal and non - conformal invariant ) have been widely investigated by the present authors@xcite .",
    "new insights and new physical phenomena with respect to string propagation in flat spacetime ( and with respect to quantum fields in curved spacetime ) have been uncovered @xcite .",
    "conformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics remains mainly unchanged . for low and high mass the string mass spectrum in conformal and",
    "non - conformal backgrounds are the same @xcite .",
    "fundamental quantum strings demand a conformally invariant background for quantum consistency ( conformal invariance is a necessary although not sufficient condition for consistency )",
    ". however , most curved spacetimes that were historically of physical interest in general relativity and cosmology are not conformally invariant .",
    "for instance black hole spacetimes and friedman - robertson - walker universes , are not of this type . in string theory ,",
    "a large amount of generalizations of these general relativity solutions have been obtained as solutions of the renormalization group @xmath0-function equations ( low energy effective string equations ) .",
    "these solutions involve , besides the metric , a number of massless fields including the dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields .",
    "the @xmath0-function equations are the basis for most investigations in string cosmology .",
    "however , they are perturbative and only known to the lowest orders in @xmath1 , and therefore , the corresponding solutions are only ensured to be conformally invariant to the lowest orders in @xmath1 .",
    "it is not generally clear how the higher order corrections will change these solutions , and possible non - perturbative solutions seem to be completely missed in this framework .",
    "a different approach to string cosmology is based on group manifolds and coset spaces and the corresponding wzw @xcite and gauged wzw models @xcite .",
    "these models provide new curved backgrounds that are conformally invariant to all orders in @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the level of the wzw model ) . in the case of group manifolds , these models are generally too simple to describe physically interesting and realistic cosmologies .",
    "this is exemplified by the well - studied @xmath4 wzw model , which describes anti - de sitter space . for the coset spaces , on the other hand , the models are generally so complicated that it is difficult even to extract what they describe from a manifest spacetime point of view .",
    "in fact , the exact ( all orders in @xmath2 ) metric , dilaton etc , have only been obtained in a limited number of low - dimensional cases ( for a rewiew of such solutions , see refs.@xcite ) . and",
    "in most of these cases , the physical spacetime properties have not really been extracted so far .",
    "most studies of coset space gauged wzw models still restrict themselves to lowest order in @xmath2 , and are thus essentially equivalent to the studies based on the @xmath0-function equations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that interesting non - trivial and non - singular cosmologies can be obtained from the cosets @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "various aspects of string theory on these cosets have been investigated in the literature , see for instance refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "cosmological interpretations have been considered in refs.@xcite , but mostly to lowest order in @xmath2    the two dimensional coset @xmath5 , to all orders in @xmath2 , has been given a cosmological interpretation in @xcite , but only in one of the coordinate patches of the global manifold . in this paper",
    ", we consider all coordinate patches and we shall show that the more interesting cosmologies actually appear in the coordinate patches considered here .    as for the three dimensional coset @xmath6 , a cosmological interpretation was attempted in @xcite , but only in certain coordinate patches and only to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "the cosmologies obtained in @xcite , however , are completely changed in the exact theory .",
    "moreover , we show that the more interesting cosmologies are obtained in other coordinate patches than those considered in @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , quantum corrections not only cancel the semiclassical singularities but also change the sign of the scalar curvature for oscillatory cosmologies , which is positive in the semiclassical regime @xmath7 and becomes negative for the value of @xmath8 dictated by conformal invariance . in non - oscillating cosmologies",
    "the scalar curvature evolves from positive for large and negatives times @xmath9 to negative near @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we consider the two - dimensional @xmath5 coset .",
    "we first re - analyse , in subsection 2.1 , the oscillating cosmology already considered in @xcite .",
    "we point out the quantum effects on the scalar curvature concerning the singularities and the sign .",
    "we also compare with standard 1 + 1 anti - de sitter space .",
    "subsections 2.2 and 2.3 are devoted to the construction of non - singular non - oscillating cosmologies , obtained from other patches of the global manifold",
    ". both deflationary and inflationary cosmologies are constructed .",
    "the corresponding scale factors , hubble functions , string - couplings etc , are analysed in detail . in particular",
    ", we obtain a non - singular cosmology going through a de sitter - like phase of inflation .    in section 3 , we consider the three - dimensional @xmath6 coset .",
    "starting from the highly non - trivial exact metric and dilaton @xcite , we first derive a relatively simple expression for the scalar curvature , showing that _ all _ semi - classical curvature singularities have disappeared ( but some new quantum curvature singularities have appeared ) .",
    "this closely resembles the situation in the two - dimensional case . in subsection 3.1",
    ", we construct a non - singular anisotropic oscillating cosmology .",
    "we analyse in some detail the scale factors and the scalar curvature , but the string - coupling is unfortunately not very well - behaved in this case .",
    "more interestingly , in subsection 3.2 , we construct a non - singular non - oscillating anisotropic cosmology , by considering a different coordinate patch ( which actually belongs to the @xmath11 coset ) .",
    "one scale factor , in this case , experiences a phase of inflationary expansion while the other scale factor experiences deflationary contraction .",
    "moreover , during this phase , the string - coupling is completely well - behaved .",
    "comparison of the two and three dimensional cases strongly indicate that this latter cosmology is a model for the higher dimensional @xmath12 or @xmath13 cosets .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we give our concluding remarks .",

    "is located at @xmath26 , that is to say , in the coordinate patch to the left of the left horizon in the @xmath27-diagram . clearly , it is then possible to construct non - singular spacetimes by considering the other coordinate patches . in the present case ,",
    "we are interested in constructing simple cosmological spacetimes , by which we mean , spacetimes with signature @xmath28 and line - element of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 plays the role of cosmic time , @xmath31 is the spatial coordinate and @xmath32 is the scale factor .      considering the coordinate patch between the two horizons , @xmath33 , and using the parametrization @xmath34 , we get the cosmology @xcite @xmath35 @xmath36 the scalar curvature @xmath37 is oscillating , finite and always negative @xmath38\\;\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; < r(t)>=-\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\approx -3.53 .. \\ ] ] it is an interesting observation that the quantum corrections not only cancel the semi - classical curvature singularities , but also change the sign of the scalar curvature , since semi - classically ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 is always positive ( and sometimes positive infinity ) .",
    "we shall see in the next section that this feature also holds in the 3-dimensional case .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity between the cosmology ( 2.9 ) and ordinary 2-dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime @xmath41 where the overall factor @xmath42 is included for convenience .",
    "direct comparison of the scale factors , hubble functions etc , reveals that there is almost no difference between the two cosmologies ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.14 ) .",
    "the main difference is found in the scalar curvature , which is constant and negative for the anti - de sitter cosmology ( 2.14 ) , while it is oscillating and negative for the coset cosmology ( 2.9 ) as we see from eq.(2.11 ) .",
    "finally we make a few comments about the dilaton ( 2.10 ) . in the present notation and conventions , the low - energy @xmath43 effective",
    "action is @xmath44\\ ] ] such that the string - coupling @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 up to an arbitrary positive multiplicative constant .",
    "it follows that we should strictly speaking only trust the cosmological solution in the regions near @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 etc .",
    "that is to say , in the regions where the scale factor @xmath50 is small . in the other regions where the scale factor is large",
    ", we should expect that string - loop corrections will be important and possibly change the solution dramatically .",
    "thus , concentrating on ( say ) the region around @xmath47 , the line - element ( 2.9 ) describes a universe experiencing deflationary contraction ( negative @xmath30 ) followed by deflationary expansion ( positive @xmath30 ) . and always with negative scalar curvature .",
    "the oscillating cosmology ( 2.9 ) was obtained for the value @xmath25 , corresponding to conformal invariance . however , using other values of @xmath8 , it is possible to construct other types of non - singular cosmologies . in that case , conformal invariance must be ensured by adding other conformal field theories .",
    "moreover , problems with unitarity will possibly appear in such cases .",
    "in this subsection , we shall not deal with these problems , but instead concentrate on the possible cosmologies that can be obtained by keeping @xmath8 arbitrary .",
    "taking @xmath51 , we observe that the curvature singularity ( 2.6 ) is located between the two horizons @xmath21 .",
    "it is then possible to construct non - singular spacetimes by specializing to the two patches outside the horizons .",
    "consider first the patch @xmath52 using the parametrization @xmath53 .",

    "more precisely , starting from flat minkowski space @xmath61 , the universe experiences deflationary contraction until @xmath47 . still deflationary",
    ", it then expands and approaches flat minkowski space again for @xmath62 ; see figure 1 .",
    "the string - coupling in this case is given by @xmath63 which is always finite , and in fact goes to zero for @xmath64 ; see figure 2 .",
    "thus , this non - singular cosmology should be trusted everywhere .",

    "however , notice that @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 thus the universe starts out as flat minkowski space at @xmath75 .",
    "it then experiences inflationary @xmath76 expansion with positive scalar curvature .",
    "just before the scale factor reaches its maximal value at @xmath47 , the scalar curvature becomes negative and the expansion becomes deflationary . for @xmath77 , the evolution is simply time - reversed ; see figure 3 .",
    "it is particularly interesting that the universe is inflationary ( @xmath78 ) with positive scalar curvature for ( large ) negative @xmath30 .",
    "this suggests that the universe goes through some kind of de sitter phase .",
    "this is confirmed by expanding the scale factor for large negative @xmath30 @xmath79 thus there is in fact an element of exponential expansion .",
    "finally , let us consider the string - coupling also in this case .",
    "it is given by @xmath80 which is finite everywhere except near @xmath47 ; see figure 4 .",

    "comparison of the semi - classical expression ( 3.6 ) and the exact expression ( 3.5 ) for the scalar curvature shows that _ all _ semi - classical curvature singularities ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) have disappeared , but that new quantum curvature singularities have appeared .",
    "the situation is thus completely analogous to the 2-dimensional case : the semi - classical curvature singularities become coordinate singularities ( horizons ) , but new quantum curvature singularities have appeared elsewhere .",

    "<S> non - singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructed using the exact conformal field theories corresponding to so(2,1)/so(1,1 ) and so(2,2)/so(2,1 ) . _ all _ semi - classical curvature singularities are canceled in the exact theories for both of these cosets , but some new quantum curvature singularities emerge . however , considering different patches of the global manifolds , allows the construction of non - singular spacetimes with cosmological interpretation . in both two and three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> we construct non - singular oscillating cosmologies , non - singular expanding and inflationary cosmologies including a de sitter ( exponential ) stage with positive scalar curvature as well as non - singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse these cosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the scale factors , the scalar curvature and the string - coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the scalar curvature is changed by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves with time in the non - oscillating cases . </S>",
    "<S> similarities between the two and three dimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional coset cosmologies : anisotropy seems to be a generic unavoidable feature , cosmological singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct non - singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing inflation while the others experience deflation . </S>"
