    "there is an increasing interest on the effects of the microscopic intrinsic inhomogeneities in high critical temperature superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "the fact that these materials have doping level and superconducting gap that , even in some of the best single crystals , vary locally inside a given sample , has profound consequences and a number of unconventional related phenomena are observed@xcite specially in the normal region of the htsc phase diagram .",
    "in particular , recent magnetic imaging through a scanning superconducting quantum device ( squid ) microscopy has displayed a static local precursor of the meissner state at temperatures as large as three times the @xmath1 of an underdoped lsco film@xcite .",
    "following up squid magnetization measurements on powder oriented ybco and lsco single crystals@xcite have shown a rather high magnetic response which , due to its large signal and structure , can not be attributed solely to the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of fluctuating superconducting magnetization@xcite .",
    "this is an unconventional behavior because low temperature superconductors exhibit only a much smaller diamagnetic signal above @xmath1 which is believe to be a consequence of the thermal fluctuations@xcite . therefore such strong magnetic response was interpreted as due to the fluctuating diamagnetism produced by superconducting islands nucleated above @xmath1@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of superconducting islands above @xmath1 is a consequence of a non - uniform or disordered intrinsic carrier density , as pointed out by ovchinnikov et al@xcite .",
    "the tendency towards the formation of magnetic domain lines or stripes was predicted long ago@xcite and verified experimentally by different groups@xcite .",
    "the stripes are formed by an instability towards charge phase separation which means hole - poor regions of antiferromagnet ( af ) insulating separated by hole - rich metallic domains .",
    "recently , the microscopic intrinsic inhomogeneities in the charge distribution , consistent with the presence of charge domains or charge stripes , has been revealed by neutron diffraction@xcite .",
    "a peak broadening in the atomic pair distribution function was measured and explained by a local microscopic coexistence of doped and undoped material@xcite .",
    "evidences for microscopic phase separation into normal and superconducting regions was also obtained by muon spin relaxation rate@xcite .",
    "therefore the inclusion of the intrinsic charge inhomogeneities or the tendency of the formation of charge domains in any calculations for the cuprates properties may be far more important than previously anticipated .",
    "the main difficulty to incorporate such effect in quantitative calculations is that the exact form of the doping or hole distribution inside a given sample is not exactly known although it is a consensus that the local doping level becomes more uniformly distributed in the materials on crossing from the underdoped into the overdoped region of the phase diagram@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a considerable improvement in the understanding of the doping level and local superconducting gap functional form has been made by scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) experiments@xcite .",
    "based on these findings , we have recently proposed a two - phase model ( undoped and doped regimes present in a given compound ) described by a bi - modal distribution of the holes inside a given compound in order to model the charge distribution for a given compound belonging to a htsc family@xcite .",
    "this distribution resembles a typical distribution of a spinodal decomposition of a binary alloy@xcite . a two - phase model which arises from the fluctuation phase of the superconducting order parameter",
    "was considered previously by emery et al@xcite .",
    "the basic ideas of our approach are : the undoped or hole - poor part of the distribution represents the af domains and the hole - rich the metallic regions . the width of the metallic distribution decreases with the sample s average doping since , as mentioned above , the hole distribution inside the compounds of a given family become more homogeneous as the average doping level or average charge density increases@xcite . due to the spatially varying local charge density , it is also expected a distribution of the local @xmath1 s , instead of a single and unique value as in usual metallic superconductors .",
    "therefore a given htsc compound with an average charge density @xmath2 possess distributions of the charge density @xmath3 , the zero temperature superconducting gap @xmath4 and the superconducting critical temperature @xmath5 , where the symbol @xmath6 means a point or small region inside the sample . in this scenario",
    "we identify the largest @xmath5 with the the pseudogap temperature @xmath0 of a given compound@xcite .",
    "doping regions with @xmath7 have a metallic behavior with a decreasing @xmath5 following a mean field pattern@xcite .",
    "upon cooling below @xmath0 the superconducting regions develop at isolated regions ( mostly with @xmath8 ) as droplets of rain in the air and , eventually they percolate at the sample superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 at which superconducting long range order is established .",
    "this superconducting percolation scenario for htsc has also been discussed previously , but with somewhat different approaches , by several authors@xcite .",
    "therefore , only at or below the percolation temperature @xmath1 a dissipationless macroscopic electrical or hole current may flow through the sample .",
    "based on these ideas , we have used a bi - modal charge distribution in connection with a mean field calculation to reproduce the phase diagram of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as function of the average doping level for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 families@xcite . in these chemical formulas @xmath11 is the doping level which is similar to the average charge density , i.e. , @xmath12 for the last ( la series ) and @xmath13 for the former ( bi ) family of compounds    the existence of the superconducting regions with different @xmath1 s in the material must manifest itself through a number of observable properties : we can number a few like the pseudogap phenomena , the resistivity and hall coefficient temperature dependence , and so on . here",
    "we want to discuss the normal state magnetization , whose study is the purpose of this paper .",
    "thus , we develop a general theory of the magnetization of a inhomogeneous superconductor which can be applied to the htsc , in order to explain the recent anomalous magnetization measurements@xcite . in a similar fashion ,",
    "l. romano@xcite introduced a theory for the magnetic response based on the fluctuations in the local order parameter which leads to a kosterlitz - thouless transition and the fluctuation - induced diamagnetism@xcite of superconducting islands above @xmath14 which reproduced well the details of the experimental data . assuming that the superconducting islands started to be formed at @xmath0 , for measurements at @xmath15 and @xmath16 close but above @xmath1 , some of these islands must be in a superconducting state and therefore they must yield a local superconducting diamagnetic response .",
    "we show below that the measured diamagnetic signal can be understood within this picture of a superconductor formed by static domains with spatial varying @xmath5s .",
    "since the local @xmath5 s can be much higher than the sample s superconducting @xmath1 , we apply the well known critical - state model ( csm)@xcite to the magnetization response under an applied field .",
    "this approach is valid with the hypothesis of the measured temperature to be below that of the irreversibility line of the local superconducting regions .",
    "some kink of hysteretic behavior was observed in ybco and in lsco samples@xcite indicating that the irreversible temperature is above @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate here that this simple procedure is able to explain and reproduce the main features of the precursor diamagnetism measured behavior .",
    "from the above discussion , since the hole distribution is not uniform , we can think of a htsc sample as formed by different metallic an insulating regions of a few nanometers of magnitude . as a consequence of such distribution , at a given temperature above @xmath0 there are insulating and metallic regions , below @xmath0 , there are insulating , metallic and superconducting regions which started to condensate in the metallic regions at @xmath0 and below @xmath1 the long range superconducting order is achieved by a percolation transition while there still are some metallic and insulating regions present in the sample . as in ref.@xcite , we model these insulator and metallic regions by a bi - modal gamma - type distribution with parameters which are based on the stm / s analysis@xcite and which was used to derive the htsc phase diagrams .",
    "now we want to use the above ideas to discuss the magnetic response @xmath17 of such inhomogeneous superconductors to an external magnetic field , between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in this range of temperature , it is clear that only the superconducting regions or droplets with their @xmath5 s bigger than @xmath1 contribute to the diamagnetic sample s magnetization .",
    "these superconducting region contributes to the sample s magnetization with a diamagnetic signal which depends on @xmath18 and the overall sample s magnetization will be sum of all these contributions .    in order to estimate the @xmath17 we follow the ideas and the procedures of the csm to each superconducting droplet . upon applying an external magnetic field ,",
    "a critical current ( @xmath19 ) is established which opposes the field as @xmath20 according to ohmer et al@xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is a temperature - dependent local constant which we have taken to be proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "hereafter we call the hole local density @xmath3 of a given domain of @xmath23 and the whole sample s average density of @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we take these superconducting droplets as cylinders of radius @xmath24 , which is sufficient small in order to have a constant charge density @xmath23 and consequently the critical temperature @xmath25 is the same within such cylinder region ( as the temperature decreases , more droplets appear and the superconducting regions increases by aggregation of droplets of different @xmath23 ) .",
    "the csm approach leads to the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization in each small cylinder as@xcite :    @xmath26^{5/2 } ) \\ ; for \\ ;   b_*\\leq b\\leq b_{c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the last expression , @xmath27 is the value of the applied external field which produce full penetration inside a cylindrical superconducting droplet , and it depends on its size as @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the vacumn permissivity .",
    "the dependence of the local critical temperatures @xmath25 is taken to be that of the pseudogap temperature of a given compound with its average charge density , namely @xmath30 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is a function which has its maximum at @xmath31 and decreases monotonously , that is , we take the local superconducting critical temperatures as a linear function of @xmath23 , @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the highest pseudogap temperature near the onset of superconductivity , i.e. , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is chosen in order to @xmath36 .",
    "notice that , since @xmath25 is a linear decreasing function of @xmath23 , the droplets with lower values of @xmath23 ( just above @xmath37 ) are more robust to an applied field in the sense that its superconducting state is not easily destroyed by the external field .",
    "since @xmath25 is constant inside a superconducting cylindrical droplet , the critical fields ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) inside the droplets will have their temperature dependence given by the gl theory , e. g. , @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] . taking into account the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath23 , we arrive at the expressions for the critical fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "a similar functional form is supposed for @xmath27 due to the @xmath21 temperature dependence .",
    "thus ,    @xmath44\\ ] ]    @xmath45\\ ] ]    @xmath46.\\ ] ]    when a given sample is submitted to an applied external magnetic field @xmath18 , the superconducting droplets with carrier concentration @xmath23 for which the applied field is higher than their second critical field @xmath47 $ ] , do not contribute to the sample magnetization .",
    "this condition is verified for droplets with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 $ ] is obtained inverting eq.5 . since @xmath25 is a decreasing function of @xmath23 , only the droplets with @xmath23 bigger than @xmath50 do not contribute to the sample s magnetization because their superconductivity is destroyed by the field @xmath18 .",
    "thus we expect that    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the distribution function for the local hole doping level at the many clusters inside a given htcs inferred in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in the context of the csm , depending on the intensity of the applied field , there are different possibilities in which each domain contributes to @xmath17 . in the low field regime",
    "the superconducting clusters will contribute to the magnetization of the sample in three forms : there are some clusters , which are not penetrated by the field @xmath18 , that is @xmath53 and they contribute to the magnetization with perfect diamagnetism ( eq.1 ) .",
    "these clusters have their carrier concentration in the interval , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the second group of clusters have their @xmath42 lower than the applied field but @xmath18 is also lower than @xmath55 .",
    "this group is partially penetrated by the field and they contribute to @xmath17 according eq.2 .",
    "these domains have their carrier concentration in the interval @xmath56<n",
    "< n_c+t_0/b-(t / b)/[1-b / b^*(0)]$ ] .",
    "lastly , there are some superconducting granules for which the applied field is higher than @xmath57 but also lower than @xmath43 .",
    "these domains contribute to the magnetization according eq.3 .",
    "therefore , for a sufficient low applied field , the general expression for the @xmath17 is given by :    @xmath58    upon increasing the applied field the number of droplets that are not penetrated by the field decreases and for fields higher than @xmath59 there are not any granules contributing with perfect diamagnetism . notice that @xmath60 is the maximum first critical field that a superconducting region can achieve .",
    "for @xmath61 , all the droplets are partially or totally penetrated by the field and they contribute to the sample s magnetization according eqs.1 - 3 .",
    "@xmath62 finally for fields higher than @xmath63 $ ] , all the superconducting granules of the sample are totally penetrated by the field and their contribution to the magnetization is @xmath64 this last three equations express the total @xmath17 for any value of the applied field .    in order to obtain a reliable value of @xmath17 and to compare with the experimental results , we have incorporated the fluctuation magnetizations induced by the superconducting order parameter , an effect which should be always present , regardless whether the superconductor is more or less inhomogeneous . as noted in reference@xcite , for superconducting droplets with a homogeneous order parameter and with dimensions @xmath65 approximately equal to the coherent length @xmath66 , the ginzburg - landau model provides an exact solution for @xmath67 .",
    "here we use a simplified `` zero - dimensional '' for superconducting clusters of radius @xmath65 smaller or near the coherence length @xmath66 , namely@xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath70 is the quantum flux and @xmath71 .",
    "this last expression yields a linear @xmath67 dependence for low fields and it has been incorporated in our calculations .",
    "the specific results for @xmath72 are shown in the insets of figs.1 - 2 .",
    "therefore eqs.7 - 11 furnish the complete @xmath73 curve for a htsc at temperatures which @xmath74 .",
    "our numerical results will be compared with the experimental results in the following section .",
    "the above theory was developed to model the measured magnetization curves of the @xmath75 family of compounds .",
    "the major difficulty is that the measurements of the pseudogap temperature curve for any family seems to vary depending on the technique used@xcite .",
    "in fact there are differences even in the @xmath1 measured values for the same htsc compound when reported by different groups , but such differences are small compared with those for the @xmath0 measurements .    in the calculations we used values taken from the local precursor diamagnetic signal@xcite and nernst effect@xcite measurements which display some local precursor order near @xmath76k .",
    "this value is considerably lower than the values of @xmath0 from transport measurements@xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the transport measurements detect the onset of pair formation while for the magnetic response a large density of pairs must be present in order to display a measurable local response .",
    "thus , we have taken @xmath77k , @xmath78k for the carrier concentration linear dependence of the droplet s critical temperature @xmath25 .",
    "in fact @xmath25 is not necessarily linear but this is an approximation which fits reasonably well the experimental data but which may be improved in the future as new experimental data becomes available .",
    "the antiferromagnetic cutoff for the carrier concentration is @xmath79 and the superconducting cutoff is @xmath80 .",
    "the probability @xmath52 is also not well known but some of its feature was inferred from stm measurements and the phase diagram , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the results of our model with the parameter which corresponds to a @xmath81 . according to our model this concentration corresponds to an lsco overdoped sample with a critical temperature of @xmath82k . in the calculations",
    "we have used @xmath83 t , @xmath84 t and @xmath85 t .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is derived from experimental values@xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not found in the literature , however one can make a fair estimation of the ratio @xmath88 through the gl parameter @xmath89 which is about 100 for some ybco and lsco compounds@xcite .",
    "the inset shows that for @xmath90k there is a low contribution at low fields from the superconducting island in the sample while at high fields only a linear contribution comes from the diamagnetic fluctuation signal . at @xmath91k",
    "there is no more contribution from the superconducting droplets and all the diamagnetic signal is only due to the magnetization fluctuations .",
    "note that the t = 28 k is the most week diamagnetic signal which appears in the fig.1 .",
    "the inset demonstrate that , at this temperatures or above , only the fluctuating magnetization is important .",
    "the qualitative features of the measurements are entirely reproduced and are simply explained by our model ; at low fields the perfect diamagnetism is expected for droplets for which the fields are lower than their @xmath38 .",
    "we expect @xmath38 to be weak because the superconducting regions formed above @xmath1 are small and isolated . by the same token ,",
    "the droplets penetrating field @xmath27 should not be very strong what decreases rapidly the overall diamagnetic signal for field much weaker than @xmath39 . as the applied field increases , the magnetic response dies off and",
    "is reduced to the fluctuations .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath17 has a minimum at very low applied fields . in fig.1",
    "we show this up - turn field near @xmath92 t which agrees with the experimental values@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that previously estimation for the up - turn field considering only the lawrence - doniach fluctuations@xcite in a layered superconductor@xcite yields expected values near @xmath93 t .",
    "these figures bring out the importance of the csm applied to the superconducting islands above @xmath1 to explain the experimental results .        in order to study the effect of the local charge inhomogeneities ,",
    "we have also performed similar calculations with parameters appropriate to an underdoped compound .",
    "it is well known that , within the same family , overdoped samples have a more homogeneous charge distribution than the underdoped ones@xcite .",
    "thus , we have chosen a compound with almost the same critical temperature @xmath1 than that of the overdoped sample ( shown in fig.1 ) to single out the effect of the charge inhomogeneities . in this simulation",
    "we used a carrier concentration of average concentration of @xmath94 with its appropriate distribution @xmath52 and with a critical temperature of @xmath95k .",
    "we have chosen the same field parameters , e.g. @xmath83 t , @xmath84 t and @xmath85 t .",
    "the results from our simulations are shown in fig.2 . in this case",
    "the overall diamagnetic signal persists for measurement temperatures higher than those for the overdoped sample .",
    "the @xmath96 field is dislocated to higher values but it is still much lower than the homogeneous lawrence - doniach@xcite fluctuating field .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a underdoped sample has a more inhomogeneous charge distribution than the overdoped compounds possessing regions where the field easily penetrates ( with local @xmath97 ) and others where are more robust to field penetration ( with local @xmath98 for instance ) .",
    "this fact is taken into account through the distribution parameters used in our simulation .",
    "the results for an underdoped compound are shown in fig . 2 where can be also noticed in the inset that as the temperature approaches 37k , the diamagnetic contribution of the superconducting droplets decreases and for measurements temperature higher than approximately 37k there is only the fluctuations contribution .",
    "it is important to mention that , although our calculations are very much in qualitative agreement with the magnetic imaging results@xcite and with the powder oriented squid magnetic measurements@xcite , there are other experiments which have not detected a @xmath96 field@xcite and have interpreted their results as solely due to the gl fluctuating diamagnetic theory@xcite .",
    "however an inspection in their curves indicates that they have not looked in detail at the low field region .",
    "the absence of a @xmath96 field was also found on an optimally doped powder oriented ybco compound@xcite whose curves followed the pure fluctuating magnetic response . in this case , the possible interpretation for a pure fluctuating diamagnetism signal , according to our theory , is that these samples must have a very good degree of charge homogeneity .",
    "this interpretation can be experimentally tested because these compounds must have @xmath0 almost equal or equal @xmath1 , as may be the case@xcite .",
    "another point which hinders a good quantitative agreement with the experimental results is that the technique used seems also to be very important in probing the details of the magnetization above @xmath1 ; while the scanning microscopy results on a lsco film indicate the presence of a visible diamagnetic signal at temperatures as large as three times the sample s @xmath1@xcite , the squid magnetization measurements detected a diamagnetic signal on oriented powder only around @xmath99 above @xmath1@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in our calculations of @xmath73 , the islands that contribute to the diamagnetic signal are in the critical state , and the measured temperature @xmath16 is below their local @xmath5 . in the other hand , the romano s calculations yield an upturn field which is almost independent of the temperature while in fig .",
    "2 we can see clearly that it decreases with the applied temperature .",
    "future experiments may distinguish which mechanism is more important or if some compounds exhibit one type and others exhibit the other .",
    "we have constructed a general theory of the diamagnetism applicable to a disordered superconductor with a distribution of regions with different local superconducting @xmath1 s .",
    "we have shown that the procedure reproduces the qualitative features of the unusual diamagnetic signal above @xmath1 measured for several htsc samples .",
    "this was done applying a csm and the well known magnetic effects for fields between @xmath38 and @xmath39 to the superconducting regions formed at temperatures below @xmath0 of an inhomogeneous htsc compound .",
    "the quantitative results can be improved when experiments provide better estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath38 .",
    "our results demonstrated that , as concluded also from others different calculations@xcite , the measured normal state magnetization curves , the @xmath96 fields and the stm magnetic imaging results may be interpreted through the formation of static superconducting islands at temperatures above the sample s @xmath1 .",

    "<S> recently experiments on high critical temperature superconductors have shown that the doping levels and the superconducting gap are usually not uniform properties but strongly dependent on their positions inside a given sample . </S>",
    "<S> local superconducting regions may develop at the pseudogap temperature ( @xmath0 ) and upon cooling , grow continuously . </S>",
    "<S> as one of the consequences a large diamagnetic signal above the superconducting critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) has been measured by different groups . here we construct a general theory to a disordered superconductor using a critical - state model for the magnetic response to the local superconducting domains between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and show that the resulting diamagnetic signal is in agreement with the experimental results .    </S>",
