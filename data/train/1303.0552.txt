    "in the last three decades , measurements of multinucleon transfer processes have been achieved extensively in heavy - ion collisions close to the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "this process is an interesting quantum dynamics of many nucleons regarded as a nonequilibrium transport phenomenon which reflects both static properties and time - dependent dynamics of colliding nuclei .",
    "the static properties include nuclear shell structure and binding energies , nuclear shapes , properties of outermost single - particle orbitals , neutron - to - proton mass ratios , pairing properties , and so on .",
    "the dynamical effects include quantum tunneling between colliding nuclei , matching of @xmath8-values and momenta , formation and breaking of the neck , quasi - fission dynamics , and so on .",
    "besides fundamental interests in its mechanisms , the multinucleon transfer reaction is also expected to be useful as a mean to produce unstable nuclei whose production is difficult by other methods .",
    "for example , a production of neutron - rich nuclei with atomic mass around @xmath9 along the neutron magic number @xmath10 has been discussed @xcite .",
    "the knowledge on structural properties of these nuclei is crucially important to understand a detail scenario of heavy elements synthesis in the @xmath11-process .",
    "an experiment to produce such neutron - rich unstable nuclei has been planned in the reactions of xe isotopes on @xmath12pt @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) .    to describe multinucleon transfer processes theoretically ,",
    "models based on a direct reaction picture such as grazing @xcite and complex wkb ( cwkb ) @xcite have been extensively developed and applied @xcite . in these models ,",
    "multinucleon transfer processes are treated statistically , using single - nucleon transfer probabilities calculated by the first - order perturbation theory . a model based on langevin - type equations of motion",
    "has also been developed @xcite .",
    "this model describes not only multinucleon transfer processes but also deep inelastic collisions , quasi - fission , fusion - fission , and fusion reactions in a unified way @xcite .",
    "although the above mentioned approaches have shown reasonable successes , these models are not fully microscopic but include some model assumptions . to get fundamental understanding of the dynamics and to present a reliable prediction for the cross sections , it is highly desired to develop a fully microscopic description for the multinucleon transfer processes with minimum assumptions on the dynamics . to this end , we conduct microscopic calculations in the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory .",
    "the theory of the tdhf was first proposed by dirac in 1930 @xcite .",
    "applications of the tdhf theory to nuclear collision dynamics started in 1970s @xcite .",
    "progresses in the early stage have been summarized in ref .",
    "since then , continuous efforts have been devoted for improving the method and extending applications @xcite . at present , three - dimensional calculations with full skyrme functionals including time - odd components are routinely conducted . in most tdhf calculations , skyrme - type interactions @xcite are used .",
    "since parameters of skyrme interactions are determined to reproduce nuclear properties for a wide mass region , there is no empirical parameter specific to the reaction .",
    "the tdhf theory may describe both peripheral and central collisions .",
    "in peripheral collisions , the mean - field of the collision partner works as a time - dependent perturbation for the orbitals . this picture of the transfer dynamics is similar to that in direct reaction models where single - particle transfer probabilities are calculated either by the perturbation theory @xcite or by solving numerically the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite . in collisions at smaller impact parameters ,",
    "the tdhf theory describes macroscopic dynamics such as fusion @xcite , quasi - fission @xcite , and deep inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "nucleons are exchanged between projectile and target nuclei through the neck formation .",
    "this description of the multinucleon transfer processes is similar to the langevin - type description @xcite . in this way",
    ", the tdhf theory is expected to be capable of describing quite different transfer mechanisms in a unified way .    in this paper",

    ", we use the projection operator method which has recently been proposed by simenel @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fact that extensive measurements are available for these systems , analyses and comparisons of these systems are of much interest since reactions in these systems are expected to show qualitatively different features . while + 124sn has almost the same neutron - to - proton ratio , @xmath6 , between the projectile and the target , other three systems have different @xmath6 ratios .",
    "we expect transfer processes towards the charge equilibrium take place in collisions with large @xmath6 asymmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the basic feature of the low - energy heavy - ion collisions depends much on the product of the charge numbers of the projectile and the target nuclei , @xmath7 .",
    "fusion reactions beyond the critical value , @xmath13 , are known to accompany an extra - push energy @xcite .",
    "analyses of the fusion - hindrance phenomena in the tdhf theory have been reported in ref .",

    "the four systems to be analyzed have different @xmath7 values , 1000 for + 124sn , 1640 for + 208pb , and 2296 for + 208pb .",
    "it has been considered that the success of the tdhf theory is limited to observables expressed as expectation values of one - body operators .",
    "indeed , the particle number fluctuation in deep inelastic collisions has been found to be substantially underestimated in the tdhf calculations @xcite . since transfer probabilities in the tdhf calculation may not be given as expectation values of any one - body operators , it is not at all obvious whether the tdhf calculation provides a reasonable description for multinucleon transfer processes .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to clarify usefulness and limitation of the tdhf calculation for the multinucleon transfer processes .",
    "we note that simenel has recently presented a calculation using the barian - vnroni prescription @xcite and concluded that the particle number fluctuation may not be affected much by the correlation effects beyond the tdhf theory for reactions which are not so much violent as deep inelastic collisions @xcite .",

    "we use a projection operator method @xcite to calculate the transfer probabilities as functions of impact parameter from the wave function after collision . from the reaction probabilities ,",
    "we evaluate cross sections for various transfer channels .",

    "208pb , and + 208pb show different behaviors in the multinucleon transfer processes characterized by the @xmath6 ratios of the projectile and the target , and by the product of the charge numbers , @xmath7 .    in the collisions with different @xmath6 ratios between the projectile and the target ( + 124sn , + 208pb , and + 208pb ) , we find a fast transfer of a few nucleons when the impact parameter is sufficiently large .",
    "the nucleons are transferred towards the direction of charge equilibrium expected from the @xmath6 ratios of the projectile and the target .",
    "this means that protons and neutrons are transferred in the opposite directions .",
    "when the @xmath6 ratios are almost equal between the projectile and the target ( + 124sn ) , we find a few nucleons are exchanged symmetrically .",
    "as the impact parameter decreases , a neck is formed at the contact of two nuclei .",
    "then the transfer process proceeds in two steps . at the beginning of the reaction before the formation of the neck ,",
    "a few nucleons are transferred in the same way as described above . after forming the neck",
    ", the transfer of a number of nucleons occurs as a result of the neck breaking when two nuclei dissociate .",
    "since both protons and neutrons in the neck are transferred simultaneously in this mechanism , protons and neutrons are transferred in the same direction .",
    "as the charge number product @xmath7 increases , there appears an impact parameter region where a thick neck is formed .",
    "we consider reactions in this impact parameter region correspond to the quasi - fission .",
    "as mentioned above , both protons and neutrons are transferred in the same direction when the neck is broken at the time of dissociation .",
    "a large energy transfer is also accompanied from the nucleus - nucleus relative motion to the internal excitations .",
    "comparisons with measured cross sections show that the tdhf calculations describe cross sections reasonably well for transfer processes of a few nucleons between the projectile and the target . as the number of exchanged nucleons increases",
    ", the agreement becomes less accurate .",
    "when more than a few protons are transferred , cross sections as functions of the transferred neutron number show a peak at the neutron number more than that in the measurements .",
    "the magnitude of the calculated cross sections becomes too small compared with the measurements .",
    "this discrepancy is expected to be , to some extent , resolved when we introduce nucleon evaporation effects in our calculations .",
    "we have compared transfer cross sections of the tdhf calculations with those by other theories .",
    "we find that results of the tdhf calculations are rather close to those of direct reaction model calculations such as grazing and complex wkb .",
    "we should note that the skyrme hamiltonian used in the tdhf calculation is entirely determined from the ground state calculations and there is no parameter introduced to describe nuclear dynamics .",
    "we thus conclude that the fully microscopic tdhf theory may describe the multinucleon transfer cross sections in the quality comparable to existing direct reaction theories .",
    "to increase the reliability of our calculation , an inclusion of evaporation effects is apparently important .",
    "since the evaporation processes take place in much longer time scale than the reaction mechanism shown here , it is not realistic to achieve the calculation within the tdhf theory .",
    "instead , we are considering to estimate them using a statistical model , putting excitation energy of the final fragments calculated in the tdhf theory as inputs .",
    "an inclusion of correlation effects beyond the mean - field approximation is also of much significance .",
    "attempts beyond the mean - field have been seriously undertaken recently in realistic calculations .",

    "@xcite , calculations based on the barian - vnroni prescription have been reported . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a stochastic effects are included in the mean - field dynamics .",
    "one of the most important correlations in nuclear low - energy dynamics is the pairing correlation .",
    "a full solution of the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) theory @xcite would provide a satisfactory description for it . at present , however , there have not yet been reported realistic tdhfb calculations of heavy - ion collisions . a simplified method to include the pairing effects in the tdhf dynamics",
