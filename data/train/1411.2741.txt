    "one of the most promising routes towards maximizing the functional potential of nanoscopic electronic and spintronic devices relies on harnessing the interplay between transport of charge , spin and energy .",
    "@xcite the interest in _ conventional _ thermoelectric effects those associated with transport of charge in nanoscopic systems was initiated more than two decades ago with experimental observations of such effects in mesoscopic conductors ( like quantum wires  @xcite and point contacts  @xcite ) , and subsequently also in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , _ spin - dependent _ thermoelectric effects those connected with transport of spin due to a particle current have only recently become the subject of experiments , which so far have encompassed a wide range of nanosystems , including magnetic tunnel junctions ,  @xcite local  @xcite and nonlocal  @xcite spin valves , and others .",
    "moreover , some new phenomena associated with electron spin and related to spin currents and/or spin accumulation , which can be considered as spin analogs of the corresponding conventional effects so called _ spin _ thermoelectric effects have also been studied .",
    "@xcite it is worthy of note that spin currents can also be independently carried by magnon excitations ,  @xcite so that corresponding spin thermoelectric effects can occur not only in metallic  @xcite or semiconducting  @xcite materials , but also in insulating magnets .",
    "@xcite    the idea of spin - dependent thermoelectric effects was originally conceived by johnson and silsbee .",
    "@xcite they predicted that in a tunnel junction with at least one of metallic electrodes being ferromagnetic , magnetization currents could be induced both electrically and thermally , and vice versa , thermal and electrical currents could also be induced magnetically .",
    "later , similar concepts were considered theoretically in a variety of nanosystems , including magnetic tunnel junctions ,  @xcite spin valves ,  @xcite quantum dots ,  @xcite , single - molecule - magnet junctions ,  @xcite and multilayered systems .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper we focus on a certain aspect of spin - related thermoelectric effects in nanoscopic systems that has not drawn much attention so far , namely on the influence of magnetic anisotropy of a system on its thermoelectric properties .",
    "first , we consider the effect of magnetic anisotropy on the system s thermoelectric characteristics in the _ linear - response _ regime .",
    "second , we propose a scheme of how magnetic anisotropy of a system can be used to induce spin - thermal effects without actually transporting charge through the system .",
    "for this purpose , we consider a nanoscopic magnetic tunnel junction with a large - spin ( @xmath0 ) impurity embedded in the barrier . in practice ,",
    "such a model captures essential features of a simple planar magnetic tunnel junction , as well as of a setup involving the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope . in either case , the role of the impurity may be played , e.g. , by a magnetic atom  @xcite or a single - molecule magnet ( smm ) .",

    "a conduction electron can flip its spin orientation when scattered on the impurity , which results in transfer of the quantum of angular momentum @xmath2 between the electron and impurity .",
    "the impurity undergoes then a transition between two neighboring spin states , @xmath3 .",
    "these transitions are schematically marked by the double - sided gray arrows .",

    "( b)-(c ) , which can be further distinguished into : ( b ) magnetic anisotropy of the ` _ _ easy - axis _ _ ' type  the spin prefers orientation along a specific axis ( _ easy _ axis , indicated by a vertical dashed bold line ) without favoring any of the two orientations , which leads to an energy barrier for spin reversal ; and ( c ) magnetic anisotropy of the ` _ _ easy - plane _ _ ' type  the spin prefers orientation close to a specific plane ( or in the plane for an integer @xmath4 ) , often referred to as the _ easy _ plane ( indicated by a color plane perpendicular to the easy axis @xmath5 ) .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy is very often also accompanied by a _ transverse _ component ( d)-(e ) , which introduces a mixing of the spin states . due to such a mixing , depicted by thin color lines connecting states in ( d)-(e )",
    ", spin - flip scattering of conduction electrons can in principle transfer the impurity between any two time - reversed ( tr ) spin states . as an illustration ,",
    "possible transitions from one specific state are marked in ( d)-(e ) on the right side , with the states in the left column being time - reversed with respect to the states in the right column .",
    "]    conduction electrons tunneling through the barrier can be scattered on the impurity , so their energy may be changed and spin orientation can be reversed .",
    "such inelastic spin - flip scattering processes establish thus a mechanism for energy and angular momentum transfer between the conduction electrons and the impurity , which , as we show below , is of key importance for _ spin _ thermoelectric phenomena .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difference between the behavior of _ spin - isotropic _ and _ spin - anisotropic _ impurities , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in the former case , where the impurity spin does not prefer any specific spatial orientation ,",
    "all @xmath1 spin states are energetically degenerate , so that only the spin angular momentum exchange can occur due to the electron scattering , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the spin - anisotropic case there are specific orientations of the impurity spin , which correspond to the lowest energy , as shown for instance in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b)-(e ) .",
    "consequently , it is then possible that conduction electrons exchange not only angular momentum with the impurity in a scattering process , but also energy can be transferred to / from the impurity during such an event .",
    "the main objective is to include these inelastic scattering processes in the description of thermoelectric phenomena .",
    "a similar problem has been analyzed in a recent paper ,  @xcite but the considerations were limited to elastic scattering processes only .",
    "thus , the corresponding description was applicable either to spin - isotropic impurities , or to spin - anisotropic case but in the low temperature limit , where only the two degenerate states of lowest energy could take part in transport . here",

    "in the situation when transport of charge , spin and energy occurs exclusively due to transfer of particles ( e.g. , electrons ) , the physical origin of the thermoelectric effects under discussion relies on the particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "@xcite when the particle - hole symmetry is present , a particle current in the presence of thermal gradient is compensated by a hole current and the net charge current vanishes .",
    "this is not the case when the particle - hole symmetry is absent and the particle and hole currents do not compensate one another . as a result ,",
    "there is a nonzero current associated with a thermal gradient . in order to ensure",
    "such a particle - hole asymmetry in planar junctions one needs to have an asymmetrical density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level in electrodes . in the case",
    "considered here , electrons traverse the barrier without entering the molecule , so this asymmetry is crucial . on the other hand , when conduction electrons tunnel through discrete levels of the molecule ( or a quantum dot ) , the dos of the molecule is usually asymmetrical except some specific positions of the fermi level , and this asymmetry is sufficient to generate thermoelectricity , also when dos of the electrodes is symmetrical ( and even independent of energy in the simplest case ) .        to make a brief survey of the conventional and spin - related thermoelectrics ,",
    "let us consider a nanoscopic system attached to two ferromagnetic metallic electrodes .",
    "we will consider only electronic contributions to transport of charge , spin and energy .",
    "if the spin diffusion length of conduction electrons is long enough relative to the system s length scale , such a system can usually be effectively represented by the transport model of two nonequivalent spin channels .",
    "generally , application of a constant voltage @xmath6 , spin voltage @xmath7 and thermal bias @xmath8 between the electrodes leads to stationary charge transport of these three quantities is at the core for emergence of conventional and spin - related thermoelectric effects , as schematically depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig13](c ) we schematically present how the processes under consideration can result in spin transport between electrodes without charge being transferred .",
    "for example , a conduction electron coming from the electrode of higher temperature ( i ) scatters on the impurity spin , which leads to the flip of the electron s spin orientation  ( ii ) .",
    "since angular momentum must be conserved in the system , it means that the quantum of angular momentum @xmath2 has been exchanged with the impurity . in particular , for a spin - up incoming electron considered in ( i ) , the electron has delivered it to the impurity .",
    "then , a similar process can occur between the other electrode ( of lower temperature ) and the impurity ( ii)-(iii ) . if as a result of this scattering process , an electron now changes its spin orientation so that it subtracts angular momentum from the impurity ( iii ) , effectively a quantum of angular momentum will be transported through the junction .",
    "importantly , because the exchange of angular momentum between electrons and the impurity requires excitation of the latter , thus  @xmath185 differs significantly from zero only if @xmath206 becomes of the order of zfs , see fig .",

    "one can see that the inclusion of @xmath323 is essential for a proper description of energy transport in the situation under discussion .",
    "another point worthy of note is that @xmath185 and @xmath18 do not depend on the magnetic configuration for @xmath324 . as a result ,",

    "it was shown that owing to the presence of the spin impurity , transport of spin and heat is still feasible in such a case . in principle",
