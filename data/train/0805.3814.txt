    "the use , in optics , of materials with nonlinear responses to external fields has over the past years provided a wealth of applications and prospects for all - optical communication , where light manipulates light itself  @xcite . especially , nonlinear photonic structures endowed with a spatially periodic refractive index provide new means to control the flow of light in the form of localized wave packets , not possible in bulk media  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of discrete localization in one and two dimensions , in arrays of coupled waveguides experiencing a cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity  @xcite or a saturable nonlinearity through the photovoltaic effect in a photorefractive medium  @xcite as well as in optically induced nonlinear photonic lattices  @xcite , shows significant progress in this direction .",
    "the theoretical foundation and predictions of these phenomena can , to good approximation , be made by models of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) type  @xcite derived within coupled - mode theory  @xcite or the tight - binding approximation using wannier function expansion  @xcite .",
    "the latter technique is also applicable for models of bose - einstein condensates trapped in deep optical lattices . in these contexts",
    "the issue of mobility of localized packets of energy is highly interesting as it provides insights as how to control optical signals , e.g. , for applications in multiport switching .    as is well known  @xcite , travelling localized solutions , or solitons ,",
    "quite generally exist in continuum systems as a result of the competition between nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "when the continuous symmetry is broken , as is the case when considering a nonlinear discrete system , the generic solution is instead a non - moving time - periodic one , called a discrete breather ( db ) or intrinsic localized mode ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the presence of a lattice leads to pinning of localized solutions , as this underlying structure effectively introduces a periodic potential for travelling excitations due to the difference in energy between stationary solutions localized on a lattice site and solutions localized between lattice sites  @xcite .",
    "this energy difference is referred to as a peierls - nabarro ( pn ) energy barrier and is the reason that narrow travelling excitations get trapped in a lattice .",
    "mobility of a highly localized stationary mode can be induced if an appropriate perturbation is added to overcome the potential barrier , but usually some energy is lost to radiation and the result is trapping  @xcite .",
    "however , excitations that are broad , in comparison with the lattice spacing , can still propagate as the effects of the pn - barrier in this case is small and the dynamics is well approximated by the continuum limit of the discrete equation .",
    "this is provided when the continuum equation has stable localized travelling solutions , which , e.g. , is the case for the 1d cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation but not for the 2d ( cubic ) equation  @xcite .",
    "notable exceptions from the pinning behaviour are integrable lattice equations , i.e. , equations possessing an infinite number of conserved quantities , like the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) model which is a discretization of the nonlinear schrdinger equation retaining this property  @xcite .",
    "these models have analytic exponentially localized travelling solutions and completely lack pn - barrier , which accounts for the excellent mobility . unfortunately , in contrast to their many interesting mathematical properties , they seem to have very limited direct applications for real systems . thus other routes to mobility in discrete systems are sought , although these models are conveniently used as the starting point of perturbative approaches . in  @xcite it",
    "is numerically shown how a mobile excitation develops a resonant tail when the governing equation deviates from the 1d integrable al - model .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the tail grows when the equation is further away from the integrable limit , or alternatively , as the pn - barrier increases from zero .",
    "it is inferred that the effect of pinning is overcome by a periodic exchange of energy between the localized core and the oscillating tail as the excitation moves through the lattice and the periodic pn - potential .",
    "this result can also be extended to a 2d setting  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a limit as to how far the mobile solutions can be continued away from the integrable limit , with broad solutions being more persistent as can be expected  @xcite .",
    "hence , we can expect that mobility of localized modes is possible when the pn - barrier is small , and the ability to tailor the size of the pn - barrier may allow for a control of the mobility of narrow solutions in a lattice .",
    "recent research has focused on ways to minimize the pn - barrier , which in optics applications means moving beyond models based on the cubic dnls equation where the pn - barrier is an increasing function of the power of the stationary modes  @xcite .",
    "similar to the problem of moving kinks in klein - gordon lattices  @xcite the introduction of competing nonlinearities has proven fruitful . in dnls equations with saturable nonlinearity the vanishing of the pn - barrier at certain points and",
    "a subsequent enhanced mobility has been demonstrated in both 1d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite , and the same apply for a 1d dnls model with nonlinear interactions  @xcite . as these models are derived from real physical settings they are interesting from an application point of view .",
    "note also that there is a large class of dnls models  @xcite with an absence of pn - barrier ( not only zero at isolated points ) , different from the more physical models , as the former are special discretizations of the nonlinear schrdinger model that in some sense preserve a translational invariant  @xcite . amongst them is the al - lattice and other integrable equations .",
    "a problem related to the vanishing of the pn - barrier at specific points is that of stability inversion between stationary solutions centred on a lattice point and between lattice points , respectively , which can be understood from the energy minimum principle .",
    "the solution with lowest energy at given power will be stable , and the change of sign of the energy difference is also related to an exchange of stability of the lowest energy modes .",
    "this can be observed for the above models  @xcite , as well as for the dnls model with competing cubic - quintic nonlinearity  @xcite and more general lattice models  @xcite . in connection with the stability inversion there",
    "also exists an intermediate asymmetric solution interpolating between the stationary solutions centred on and in - between sites and bifurcating with these at the points where they change their stability properties  @xcite . for the 1d saturable dnls model this solution",
    "can even be found analytically near the first zero of the pn - barrier  @xcite . from this viewpoint",
    ", the mobility of a highly localized mode may be thought of as a transformation between stationary on- and off - site solutions , via the intermediate solution .",
    "hence a more accurate definition of the pn - barrier would need to include also the intermediate solution as this may be the mode with the highest energy .",
    "therefore , we will distinguish between the _ energy difference _ between two fundamental modes and the _ pn - barrier _ relating to the energy of all involved stationary modes . also , in 2d , one would in principle need to consider modes corresponding to different directions of possible propagation  @xcite .",
    "though localized modes and their mobility are interesting for beam steering in waveguide arrays , transport of energy in the transversal direction ( from waveguide to waveguide ) can be achieved also by a collective excitation of the waveguides . with a plane wave propagating in the array",
    ", the same power will be transported along all waveguides , but there will also be a transfer of power between the waveguides depending on the wave number ( phase gradient ) of the plane wave . in  @xcite it",
    "is demonstrated that the direction and magnitude of the transversal flow of power in a 1d array with nonlinear coupling are quite versatile under the variation of the amplitude and wave number of the plane waves . here",
    "the discussion is extended to 2d and will show an even greater flexibility .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present a model for optical waveguides coupled in two spatial dimensions and embedded in a nonlinear kerr material , discuss its relevance and introduce some of the important properties of the model .",
    "we should stress that our model does _ not _ attempt to describe configurations where the waveguides themselves are nonlinear , such as those presently experimentally realized in , e.g. , @xcite , but rather correspond to the original proposal of jensen @xcite with the nonlinearity residing solely in the _ embedding _ material .",
    "the stability of the fundamental localized modes are investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : stationary ] and their relation to mobility of localized excitations is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mobility ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compact ] some special solutions , like compact and complex modes , arising from a balance of the coupling terms in the model are presented . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : planewave ] the transport properties of plane waves are analyzed before we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we also include in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] a brief discussion about some recent related works , which appeared in press after the original submission of this manuscript .",
    "the model we consider is a direct extension to two spatial dimensions of a one - dimensional model for the propagation of the electric field amplitudes in coupled optical waveguides embedded in a nonlinear material  @xcite .",
    "the waveguides are identical and regularly spaced in the two spatial dimensions , thus forming a square lattice .",
    "coupling between the sites of the lattice is mediated by an evanescent field overlap of the modes ( single - mode propagation ) in the respective waveguides and it is assumed that the modes decay sufficiently fast outside the waveguides to motivate only nearest - neighbour coupling .",
    "further , the waveguides themselves are assumed to be constructed from a _ linear _ material and _ surrounded by a nonlinear kerr material_. this will tend to strengthen the effects of nonlinear coupling with respect to on - site nonlinear effects when compared to a system where also the waveguides are nonlinear .",
    "this motivates an extension of the generally employed cubic on - site dnls model to an equation that in two dimensions will read @xmath0 \\\\     & + 2q_{5}\\big[2|\\psi_{n , m}|^{2}\\delta\\psi_{n , m }        + \\psi_{n , m}^{2}\\delta\\psi_{n , m}^ { * } \\\\     & \\phantom{+2q_{5}[0 }        + \\delta(\\psi_{n , m}|\\psi_{n , m}|^{2 } ) \\big ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the complex amplitude of the electric field , @xmath2 measures the propagation along the waveguide array and the coupling parameters @xmath3@xmath4 are given by overlap integrals of the modes . the operator @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 .",
    "( note that the operator @xmath7 is the standard 2d discrete laplacian . )",
    "the model  ( [ eq : xdnls ] ) is also relevant in other contexts , e.g. , as a nonlinear tight - binding approximation , with @xmath8 argued to be negligible , for the time - evolution of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in a deep periodic optical potential  @xcite , or for @xmath9 as a rotating - wave approximation to a fermi - pasta - ulam chain  @xcite . in both these",
    "one - dimensional models the extension to two spatial dimensions is straightforward .",
    "one may also in a straightforward way consider extensions to other lattice geometries , such as e.g.  triangular / hexagonal patterns ( which in some sense could be considered as the most natural packing of waveguides in two dimensions ) . in this work , we chose to consider only the square lattice which is the simplest 2d structure to analyze from a modelling point of view , and also for comparison with previously published work in the area which mainly dealt with square - lattice configurations .",
    "we expect that most of the qualitative results obtained here will persist also for different lattice geometries , although a more detailed discussion on these issues is beyond the scope of the present work .      for general waveguide arrays @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , have the same sign as the kerr index of the nonlinear material .",
    "estimates of the relative strengths of the parameters show that the nonlinear coupling terms , @xmath8 and @xmath4 , can be up to the same order of magnitude as the on - site nonlinearity @xmath13 for an array of waveguides constructed from algaas with sizes in the tenth of micrometer regime and operated with a laser in the infrared ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "details of the derivation of the 1d model can be found in  @xcite and a calculation of the coupling parameters for a slab waveguide array can be found in appendix a of  @xcite ( see in particular fig .",
    "a2 in  @xcite for an explicit illustration of realistic values for relative coupling strengths ) . when extending the model to two dimensions there is also the possibility of coupling in the diagonal direction between next - nearest neighbours .",
    "however , for experimentally relevant sizes , as given above , of an array of square waveguides the linear diagonal coupling can be estimated to be an order of magnitude smaller than the linear direct coupling ( see appendix a2 in @xcite ) .",
    "also , when operated in the power regime where the most interesting phenomena occur , the nonlinear coupling and on - site terms will be of the same order as the linear coupling , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath12 .",
    "this can be shown to correspond to powers of a few kw  @xcite , well within what is experimentally available . however , although these estimates of the parameter values are of relevance when considering experimental verifications and applications of the model they will not be taken as a restriction in the present paper , since we are also interested in the general effects of nonlinear coupling .",
    "further , the parameter @xmath3 can be made to vanish by the transformation @xmath16 and has no significant physical role .",
    "note also that the staggering transformation @xmath17 is equivalent to changing the sign of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath4 , thus reducing the part of parameter space that needs to be investigated to get a complete picture of the equation .",
    "further , by rescaling the amplitudes and the time - like variable , two additional parameters can be fixed . here",
    "we will fix @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while restricting @xmath21 without loss of generality .      from noether s theorem",

    "but from a mathematical viewpoint it can be treated as the energy of the system .",
    "in particular , for the cubic dnls model it holds that a bounded extremum ( a maximum in the present formulation since @xmath30 and hence @xmath29 should be regarded as negative energy ) of @xmath29 for given norm @xmath31 is lyapunov stable and may , with right , be called the ground state of the system  @xcite .",
    "this ground state is conjectured to be unique up to a global phase factor , which is consistent with the absence of stability inversion and the non - vanishing pn - barrier in the cubic on - site dnls model .",

    "hence the physical interpretation of @xmath47 is the flow of power from site @xmath46 to site @xmath48 .",

    "[ sec : introduction ] ( especially for the corresponding 1d model  @xcite ) , the enhanced mobility of localized modes is connected to the vanishing of a pn - barrier measuring the difference in hamiltonian between fundamental stationary modes .",

    "however , for a fixed frequency and varying norm the relevant energy quantity would instead be the grand canonical free - energy @xmath62 , with @xmath61 acting as a chemical potential , as used in  @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of stationary modes is most simply investigated by studying the evolution of a small perturbation in the rotating frame of reference .",

    "due to the global phase invariance , @xmath69 is always a double eigenvalue .",
    "a stationary solution is linearly stable if all eigenvalues are located on the imaginary axis , i.e. , we can actually at most make a statement about marginal stability of the solution ( meaning that a perturbation at most will grow with a rate that is polynomial in @xmath2 ) .",

    "[ fig : bifurc1 ] and  [ fig : bifurc2 ] ) .",
    "the same behaviour appears also in 1d  @xcite , and is presumably an effect of the nonlinear coupling terms that can lead to a vanishing effective coupling between lattice sites .",

    "a bit surprisingly , when considering the results of the stability analysis of stationary solutions , the mobility of localized modes in the model  ( [ eq : xdnls ] ) is very poor and in stark contrast to the very excellent mobility in the 1d model  @xcite and the saturable model in 1d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite near points of minimal pn - barrier .",
    "the method used to try to induce mobility is to apply a phase gradient @xmath80 across one of the stationary real solutions . in applications",
    "this can be achieved by launching the laser beam that excites the waveguides at an angle to the face of the array  @xcite .",
    "this perturbation will kick the solution in the direction of the phase gradient  @xcite and will have an effect similar to the marginal mode perturbation at an instability boundary described in  @xcite , which in a complex formulation will correspond to a pure imaginary ( velocity ) perturbation to the real ( position ) solution .",
    "the phase gradient perturbation also has the nice feature of preserving the norm .",
    "here we are strictly interested in axial propagation as this is the direction of possible propagation in the lattice suggested by the minimal pn - barrier of the stationary modes . therefore @xmath81 has consistently been used .",

    "further , we have shown how the transversal flow of power in the array of waveguides can be controlled with great flexibility by excitation with plane waves , and in particular explicitly demonstrated how the transport _ direction _ may be continuously tuned by _ amplitude _ variation .",
    "this may have applications for power - coupling devices .",

    "a 1d array  @xcite or an array exhibiting a saturable  @xcite or quadratic  @xcite ( see discussion below ) nonlinearity instead of the kerr nonlinearity is better suited .      in  @xcite ,",
    "abdullaev et.al extended the wannier - function approach of  @xcite for the continuous 1d nls equation with periodic linear potential to the case with periodic variation also for the nonlinearity coefficient ( which is the case also considered in our work ) .",
    "within the tight - binding approximation , they derived under quite general conditions a lattice equation , which in a special case ( @xmath196 in  @xcite ) is equivalent to the 1d version of our eq .",
    "( [ eq : xdnls ] ) as derived in  @xcite . an important conclusion of  @xcite is the crucial importance to include also the nonlinear coupling terms ( corresponding to our @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) , as they for specific choices of nonlinear interactions were shown to be comparable with , or even stronger than , the on - site nonlinearity .",
    "thus , this supports the soundness of our approach to consider variation of the parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 over a rather large range of values .",
    "several works discussing properties of moving solitons and ( vanishing ) pn - barriers in 1d generalized dnls models have appeared .",
    "dmitriev , khare et al .",
    "@xcite found analytically exact stationary and moving solutions for some of the exceptional , translationally invariant discretizations of  @xcite . whether these are of relevance for any physically realizable system is , to our knowledge , still unclear .",
    "pelinovsky et al .",
    "@xcite developed a mathematical technique for analysis of persistence of traveling single - humped localized solutions from a certain limit , and found specifically that while travelling solutions terminated when continued from the integrable al - limit of the salerno model ( corresponding to the development of a resonant tail  @xcite ) , they generally persisted in the translationally invariant models .",
    "oxtoby and barashenkov  @xcite used the method of asymptotics beyond all orders to evaluate the amplitude of radiation from a moving small - amplitude soliton in the saturable dnls equation , and found it to be completely suppressed at certain ` sliding velocities ' , where , similarly as in  @xcite , it was interpreted as an embedded soliton .",
    "the properties of the travelling solitary waves in the saturable model were also analyzed numerically in more detail by melvin et al .  in  @xcite .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , susanto et al .",
    "@xcite studied the mobility of discrete solitons in a square lattice with _ quadratic _",
    "( second - harmonic - generating ) nonlinearity . in this case ,",
    "due to the absence of collapse instability in the continuum limit , good mobility of stable solutions was observed as long as the coupling constants were not too small ( ` quasicontinuum regime ' ) . in this regime ,",
    "mobility in arbitrary directions ( not necessarily axial or diagonal ) was observed , which is not surprising since discreteness effects are smoothened out for broad , continuum - like solitons .",
    "however , no non - trivial zeros of the pn barrier were found for this model , and consequently strongly localized solutions were reported to be immobile .",
    "thus , in many aspects , the mobility properties of the 2d model with quadratic nonlinearity is similar to those of the 1d cubic on - site dnls model .    finally , a very recent preprint by chong et al .",
    "@xcite extended the analysis of the on - site cubic - quintic dnls model of  @xcite to higher dimensions .",
    "as concerns the two - dimensional mobility , the results were shown to be very similar to that of the saturable model  @xcite : enhanced mobility was found in regimes close to stability inversion and associated with appearance of asymmetric intermediate solutions and low pn barrier .",
    "thus , as far as we are aware , the present work still provides the only known explicit example of a model where these properties do _ not _ lead to an enhanced mobility .",
