    "the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , a technique for the enzymatic amplification of specific target segments of dna , has revolutionized molecular biological approaches involving genomic material . this , in turn , has impacted research in human genetics , disease diagnosis , cancer detection , evolutionary and developmental biology , and pathogen detection , to name a few .",
    "the company idaho technology , inc .",
    "has capitalized on the invention of fluorescent probe techniques to create fast , accurate devices for quantitative pcr .",
    "quantitative pcr is a method where the amount of amplified dna ( or amplicon ) is tracked throughout the reaction and the initial amount of sample dna can then be estimated .",
    "understanding the important parts of a complex reaction that is repeated tens of times , is critical in improving the design of these processes in the laboratory , and to date theoretical studies of quantitative pcr are limited . in this paper",
    "we present a suite of deterministic models for quantitative pcr , with parameters estimated from data provided from roche lightcycler ( tm ) pcr runs . determining the critical features of the model through construction of increasingly complex descriptions of",
    "the reaction is the overall goal of the project .    in pcr a reaction mixture containing a few copies of the target double - stranded dna",
    "is first heated to separate the dna into single strands .",
    "it is then rapidly cooled and held at a lower temperature briefly so that pcr primers ( short single strands of dna that have been designed for this purpose ) anneal specifically to the template dna .",
    "the enzyme taq polymerase recognizes these primer - template pairs and synthesizes a new strand of dna , starting at the end of the annealed primer . in this way",
    ", a complementary strand is made from each strand of the original double - stranded dna molecule . under ideal reaction conditions",
    "the number of copies of this stretch of dna in the sample is doubled in each heating - cooling cycle .",
    "instruments that perform real - time pcr usually detect the amplified dna using fluorescent probes that are added to the pcr reagents before temperature cycling .",
    "these probes bind to the dna and generally fluoresce more when bound than when free .",
    "when there is a sufficient quantity of dna present in the sample ( for example , after many temperature cycles ) , this change in fluorescence is detected using a fluorimeter .",
    "if the fluorescent signal of a sample rises above a background level , a sizable amount of dna has been synthesized , indicating that the specific dna was initially present .",
    "current methods for dna quantification ( for more information see the following references : morrison et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , wittwer et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) , weiss and von haeseler ( 1997 ) , sun ( 1995 ) , sun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) with pcr are based on comparing a set of successively diluted standards against unknown samples .",
    "the methods utilize the concentrations of the standards in a dilution series to determine the concentration of the unknown . the amount of dna in successively diluted standards is typically decreased by factors of 2 or 10 , and anywhere from three to ten standards are used .",
    "figure 1 shows a set of six standards containing between one and 1,000,000 copies of initial dna template .",
    "the fluorescence curve that crosses the threshold value at the smallest cycle number initially had 1,000,000 copies of dna , the next curve to cross the threshold had 100,000 copies of dna initially , and so on .",
    "notice that the curve that does not cross the threshold is the control - no - template sample . also plotted on this graph",
    "are two sets of replicates with unknown initial quantities of dna template .",
    "a quick estimate of the order of magnitude of the number of copies of dna initially in the unknown samples can be found by simply comparing the amplification curves of the samples and diluted standards .",
    "current methods produce more precise estimates using a mathematical model of pcr that assumes the product grows exponentially :    @xmath0    in this model , @xmath1 represents the number of copies of dna , @xmath2 represents the cycle number and @xmath3 represents the efficiency of the pcr .",
    "@xmath3 can be thought of as the percentage of existing dna that is replicated in a cycle .",
    "dilution standards have known values for @xmath4 , and data from these samples can be used to calculate the efficiency @xmath3 . given the efficiency ,",
    "the initial copy number @xmath4 can be estimated for each unknown sample .",
    "this model is accurate for a small number of cycles , but grows less and less accurate as the number of dna copies grows .",
    "unfortunately , the fluorescence signal can be distinguished from the noise only later in the experiment , precisely as the model becomes less accurate .",
    "the simplest mistake in the model is the assumption that the efficiency does not change with cycle number , and that the number of copies of dna always grows . in reality ,",
    "pcr products saturate the reaction and resources are exhausted , slowing and eventually stopping dna synthesis .",
    "the amplification curves thus suggest that a more natural model for the pcr reaction would be logistic , which proceeds to saturation as a resource is depleted .",
    "current it software fits the data to such a logistic map , and uses the result to estimate initial copy number of the template . for the purpose of this estimation both the exponential growth model and the logistic model are sufficient in many cases , and have the advantage of a limited number of free parameters , requiring a minimum amount parameter estimation .",
    "however , for the long range goal of developing a more complete model of the reaction that can lead to innovation in process design , we must look beyond these one dimensional approximations . we also see that the data deviate from the logistic model in a consistent way for all the amplification curves , suggesting that the simplifications leading to it eliminate some critical features of the dynamics .    to our knowledge no deterministic model of the reactions of pcr that does not include assumptions about the kind of enzyme kinetics involved ( i.e. michaelis - menten ) are present in the literature .",
    "stochastic models for estimating reaction efficiency and specificity can be found however , for instance , in sun ( 1995 ) a model for distributions of mutations and estimation of mutation rates during pcr is developed , using the theory of branching processes .",
    "another such model is reported in weiss and von haeseler ( 1995 ) , where the accumulation of new molecules during pcr is treated as a randomly bifurcating tree to estimate overall error rates for the reaction . in schnell and mendoze ( 1997 )",
    ", the reaction efficiency of quantitative competitive pcr ( qc - pcr : a target and a competitor template are amplified simultaneously to provide an internal standard for identifying the initial target template amount ) is computed using michaelis - menten type kinetics .",
    "stolvitzky and cecchi ( 1996 ) address the validity of assuming a constant efficiency during a pcr reaction by deriving the probability of replication during successive cycles as a function of physical parameters . in the same vein ,",
    "velikanov and kapral ( 1999 ) report on a probabilistic model of the kinetics of pcr using microscopic markov processes .",
    "the result is an exact solution for the distribution of lengths of synthesized dna strands , and an optimization procedure is applied to determine control parameters that maximized the yield of the target sequence .",
    "most recently , in a 2004 publication whitney et al . describe a stochastic model for competitive interactions during pcr to compute product distributions at the completion of regular pcr .",
    "the calculated yield is compared to experimental values from the amplification of three different size amplicons , with good results .    in this paper",
    "we develop deterministic models based directly on the reaction equations using the law of mass action .",
    "a hierarchy of models is built by including more biochemistry into each successive level of approximation .",
    "we analyze qualitatively and numerically the solutions to the models under typical operating conditions , and perform parameter estimation with data provided by idaho technology .",
    "finally the advantages and disadvantages of including more details of the reactions into the model are discussed .",
    "table i : list of variables and notation used in pcr models    [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     comparing the fitted parameters for the different replicates in the unknown sample runs points out an obvious flaw with this parameterization .",
    "there is clearly more than one parameter set with an equally good fit to the data , meaning hidden dependencies in the parameters that simple rescaling can not uncover .",
    "determining these dependencies through alternative rescalings and singular perturbation analysis , and through other parameter estimation techniques is the subject of ongoing research .",
    "turning to the problem of realistic initial primer concentration , we found that for values much less than 1.0 the model did not capture the non - logistic behavior of the data .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fittedodemodel ] b ) , where the curves have a concave down portion near the end of the run , indicating the slowing of growth of the amplicon . in figure [ p0figure ]",
    "we illustrate this by graphing the logarithmic regression variable for differing values of initial primer , with all other parameters fixed . in performing parameter estimation , and taking lower initial primer concentration",
    ", we found that we could not overcome the logistic - type behavior by varying other reaction parameters .",
    "a heuristic explanation for this is that the nucleotides must be running out as well as primer in this model to get the slower than logistic growth at the end of the run .",
    "the equation for @xmath5 ( from the two dimension reduction ) is @xmath6 so the rate of loss of @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the amount of dsdna created is equal to @xmath7 at the end of the cycle , so slower loss of @xmath2 means slower growth of @xmath8 and hence @xmath9 .",
    "if the initial primer concentration is not close to that of the initial nucleotide concentration the quantity @xmath2 ( which is depleted necessarily at the same rate as @xmath10 ) will not become small , and the rate of creation of @xmath9 will not slow accordingly .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a sequence of models for the reactions of pcr .",
    "exponential growth , the first order approximation of simple doubling of the dna strands , is replaced by a logistic model which captures the sigmoidal nature of the amplification curves .",
    "both these models are in common use in current devices .",
    "we postulated a variation on the logistic model where the efficiency decreases in time , and were able to fit the data with good results .",
    "this , however , is less satisfactory than a model built directly from the reactions that captures the decrease in efficiency as cycle number increases .",
    "we then built two such models , one that does not include the enzyme taq directly , and a second which does .",
    "the model that did not include taq dynamics is solvable analytically , at least for each stage .",
    "a map is created by linking the closed form solutions through their initial conditions .",
    "it was found that the data could be well estimated by reasonable parameter values if the initial amount of primer was taken close to that of the initial amount of nucleotide .",
    "this is not the protocol followed in the experiment , however , where for a 200 bp sequence the primer : nucleotide ratio is about 1:4 .",
    "it appears that the amount of nucleotides in the reaction must decrease significantly by the end of the reaction in order to obtain a decrease in overall reaction efficiency . for this to happen the initial concentration of primer must about that of the nucleotide . from these observations we concluded that the model without taq dynamics did not capture the full behavior of the amplification curves .",
    "the second model is built on reactions that include the formation of a complex of primed ssdna and the taq enzyme .",
    "the equations of stage i could still be solved analytically , but this was not possible for stage ii . instead limiting cases of long integration time in stage",
    "i or stage ii or both were considered , and by analyzing the amplification curves created by these maps we concluded that none of the limiting cases , including variable annealing and long time extension , would create the desired behavior at the end of the reaction .",
    "if the extension stage of the reaction was very fast compared to the annealing phase , you might expect to capture the qualitative behavior with this last case .",
    "as none of the limiting cases created the qualitative end - of - reaction behavior we thought the data demonstrate so clearly , we proceeded to parameterize the full equations for the two stage model with taq dynamics . with a map created from solutions to these we were able to find parameters that captured the decreased efficiency at the end of the reaction , but only if initial primer concentration was again roughly the same size as the initial concentration of nucleotides .",
    "the extension phase of the reaction would need to slow accordingly to fit this aspect of the behavior .",
    "also , multiple sets of parameters were found to fit the same amplification run , indicating hidden dependencies in the parameters that simple rescaling does not uncover .    while we were not able to completely explain the reduced efficiency seen in the data with our suite of models",
    ", we were able to determine what portions of the model were important in capturing its non - logistic character .",
    "competing reactions at higher cycle numbers most certainly will have an effect on the efficiency , especially with the lower initial copy number runs .",
    "future work will include analyzing these dependencies both numerically and analytically , and using the two stage model to seek reaction protocols that minimize time to almost complete creation of amplicon , and maximize yield for a fixed total cycle time .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "david eyre , idaho technology , for suggesting the problem and for providing us with it data and much consultation .",
    "this work was partially supported by a utah state university community / university initiative grant , a usu center for integrated biosystems seed grant , and one undergraduate ( john goldes ) was supported by nsf - epscor funds at the university of montana - missoula .",
    "this stability analysis uses the two dimensional system that takes advantage of the conserved quantities , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in the following @xmath14 and",
    "all the initial quantities are positive .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16                    case1 : @xmath36 .",
    "both coordinates of the first fixed point are non - negative .",
    "the eigenvalues are real and negative .",
    "they are real because the discriminant is greater than zero .",
    "proof : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 they are both negative . proof :      case 2 : @xmath47 the first fixed point becomes @xmath48 which still is nonnegative .",
    "the eigenvalues become : @xmath49 and @xmath50 for this case , there is only one nonzero eigenvalue , @xmath51 , which is negative .                              for case 1 , f.p.1 is a sink , but becomes a saddle as s(0 ) becomes larger than n(0)(for case 3 ) .",
    "the opposite occurs for f.p.2 .",
    "it starts out as a saddle ( for case 1 ) and becomes a sink ( for case 3 ) .",
    "this indicates a transcritical bifurcation when the initial amount of nucleotides equals the initial amount of primed single - strand dna ."
