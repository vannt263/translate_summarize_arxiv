    "the concept of negative absolute temperature was invoked to explain the results of experiments with nuclear - spin systems carried out by pound @xcite , purcell and pound @xcite and ramsey and pound @xcite . shortly after these experiments",
    ", ramsey @xcite discussed the thermodynamic implications of negative absolute temperature and their meaning in statistical mechanics , thereby granting this concept a well - grounded place in physics  @xcite .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble , which provides the statistical description of an isolated system at equilibrium , is the most appropriate venue to discuss negative temperatures . in this ensemble ,",
    "the thermodynamic quantities , like temperature and specific heat , are derived from the entropy through suitable thermodynamic relations .",
    "for instance , the inverse temperature is proportional to the derivative of the entropy with respect to the energy . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , there are at least two commonly accepted definitions of entropy : the boltzmann entropy is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates in a given `` energy shell '' , whereas the gibbs entropy is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates up to a given energy .",
    "the debate as to which of these definitions of entropy is the correct one has been going on for a long time @xcite , although the general consensus is that they are basically interchangeable .",
    "in fact , for standard systems with a large number of degrees of freedom they are practically equivalent @xcite .",
    "full equivalence is obtained in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the existence of negative - temperature states provides a major bone of contention in the debate .",
    "in fact , negative temperatures emerge in the boltzmann description whenever the number of microstates in a given energy shell is a decreasing function of the relevant energy . on the contrary",
    ", the gibbs temperature can never be negative , since the number of microstates having energy below a given value is always a non - decreasing function of such value .",
    "thus , systems admitting negative ( boltzmann ) temperatures provide an ideal context to address the matter of the correct definition of entropy .",
    "recently @xcite it was argued that for a broad class of physical systems , including standard classical hamiltonian systems , only the gibbs entropy yields a consistent thermodynamics , and that , consequently , negative temperatures are not achievable within a standard thermodynamical framework . in this respect , what is usually referred to boltzmann _ temperature _ would not possess the required properties for a temperature @xcite .",
    "these and other related arguments @xcite have been contended @xcite , in what has become a lively debate .    in the present manuscript , at first we focus on the class of systems",
    "whose canonical ( or , possibly , grand canonical ) ensemble is equivalent to the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "thus we implicitly exclude non - extensive systems , and systems at the first - order phase transitions .",
    "we show that such equivalence can be rigorously satisfied only if the thermodynamics of the latter ensemble is derived by the boltzmann entropy . for such systems",
    "we show that the boltzmann temperature provides a consistent description with those of the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "therefore we conclude that , also in the case of isolated systems for which a comparison between different statistical ensembles is not possible , the boltzmann entropy provides the correct description .",
    "+ later , we focus on a general system and we prove that the boltzmann entropy is thermostatistically consistent and does not violate any fundamental condition for the microcanonical entropy .    the outline of the paper is the following . in sec . [ sec : mc ] we summarize the essential features of systems in which negative boltzmann temperatures are expected . in sec . [",

    "sec : compar ] we prove that , for systems whose canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent , the thermodynamically consistent definition for the temperature is the one derived with the boltzmann entropy .",
    "furthermore we show that , in the thermodynamic limit , the gibbs and boltzmann temperatures do coincide when the latter is positive whereas the inverse gibbs temperature is identically null in the region where boltzmann provides negative values for the temperature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : consistency ] we recall the critique of consistency of boltzmann entropy raised recently in literature and , in sec .",
    "[ sec : proof ] we prove that the boltzmann entropy is consistent from a mathematical and thermodynamical point of view . in section",
    "[ sec : evidence ] , we give two examples of systems supporting negative boltzmann temperatures for which the grand - canonical ( or canonical ) ensemble and the microcanonical description given by the boltzmann entropy do agree on the whole parameter space and on the complete range of values of the energy - density .",
    "we show that the equipartition theorem fails for system with negative boltzmann temperatures in sec .",
    "[ sec : equipar ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measuring ] we show through numerical simulations on a specific system , that negative temperatures are accessible .",
    "we show that , irrespective of the sign of the temperature , a large microcanonical lattice acts as a thermostat for a small grand canonical sublattice , and this confirms the ensemble equivalence .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that , irrespective of the sign of the temperature , two isolated systems at equilibrium at different inverse temperatures , reach an equilibrium state at an intermediate inverse temperature , after that they are brought in contact .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble describes the equilibrium properties of an isolated system , that is to say in which energy , and possibly further quantities , are conserved . within the microcanonical description , all the thermodynamic quantities",
    "are derived from the entropy , for instance the inverse temperature of the system is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath2 is the entropy density corresponding to a given energy density @xmath3 .",
    "the two alternative definitions for the entropy used in equilibrium statistical mechanics are ascribed to boltzmann and gibbs . according to boltzmann s definition @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density of microstates at a fixed value energy density @xmath3 and , possibly , at a fixed value of the additional conserved quantities ,",
    "@xmath6 is a constant with the same dimension as @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is the number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the gibbs entropy is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of microstates with energy density less than or equal to @xmath3 and , possibly , at a fixed value of the additional conserved quantities .",
    "it is known that in the thermodynamic limit these two definitions of entropy lead to equivalent thermodynamic results in `` standard '' systems @xcite .",
    "so far , these two entropy definitions have been used in an alternative ( interchangeable ) way in statistical mechanics , by resorting to the most suitable form depending on the specific problem considered .",
    "these two entropy definitions are connected by the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 since @xmath13 , gibbs temperatures are not negative and consequently the two entropies have incompatible outcomes if applied to systems that admit negative boltzmann temperatures .    a necessary ( although not sufficient ) condition for a system for having negative temperatures is the boundedness of the energy ( as in the case of nuclear - spin systems discussed by pound _ et al _ ) , in this case a local maximum inside the system s density energy interval of the boltzmann entropy @xmath14 is not forbidden and , both positive and negative boltzmann temperatures are possible .",
    "hamiltonians with bounded energies can also be characterized by the existence of more than one first integral of motion and , for this reason , in addition to the statistical mechanics of systems with one first integral , we will consider also the case of systems with more then one first integrals . within the latter class for instance",
    "there are models usually employed for describing ultracold atoms .",
    "the possibility of observing negative temperature states in ultracold systems , has been theoretically predicted by some authors with different approaches @xcite and , the experimental evidence of the existence of states for motional degrees of freedom of a bosonic gas at negative ( boltzmann ) temperatures , have been achieved a few years ago by braun _",
    "the interpretation of such experimental results has been contested in @xcite .",
    "successively @xcite it has been argued that for a broad class of systems that includes all `` standard classical hamiltonian systems'' only the gibbs entropy satisfies all three thermodynamic laws exactly .",
    "these papers have engendered a glowing debate between supporters of the gibbs entropy @xcite and those considering correct the boltzmann entropy @xcite .",
    "let us consider first a generic classical many - particle system described by an autonomous hamiltonian @xmath15 , in which the energy is the sole first integral of motion .",
    "the boltzmann entropy density @xmath14 in this case is given by @xmath16 whereas the one of gibbs is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dirac function and @xmath19 is the heaviside function .",
    "as a consequence of the conservation of energy , the system dynamics takes place on energy - level sets . from liouville theorem",
    "it descends that the measure of the euclidean volume is preserved by the dynamics and this induces a measure @xmath20 conserved on each energy level set @xmath21 of energy density @xmath3 which is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the euclidean measure induced on @xmath21 and @xmath24 is the euclidean norm .",
    "this means that , under the hypothesis of ergodicity , the averages of each dynamical observable @xmath25 of the system can be equivalently measured along the dynamics as @xmath26 or as average on the hypersurface @xmath21 according to @xmath27 now , it is reasonable to expect that the temperature , the specific heat , and the other thermodynamic observables could be measured as time averages of suitable observables @xmath25 along the dynamics , in a way analogous to eq .",
    "( [ phit ] ) . consequently , when ergodicity holds , the measures of these quantities have to be derived from averages upon the energy level sets @xmath21 , according to eq .",

    "the expression for the inverse temperature is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , _ that can not be expressed in the form ( [ phimu])_. in other words , by adopting the gibbs entropy definition when ergodicity holds true , _ _ one has to trust in the very singular fact that time averages of thermodynamic quantities taken along the dynamics ( and then on the energy level set @xmath21 ) coincide with the averages of quantities taken on a set that includes all the energy levels below to the one on which the dynamics takes place , analogously to eq . of the inverse temperature__.    in the case of @xmath36 , one could suggest that the gibbs temperature can be measured as a microcanonical average by resorting to the equipartition theorem . nevertheless , as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : equipar ] , for instance in the case of systems with negative boltzmann temperatures , the `` standard '' equipartition theorem fails .",

    "for such a system , the motion takes place on the manifolds @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are subsets of @xmath44 where @xmath45 is constant . in ref .",

    "( [ niceformula2 ] ) .",
    "_ remarkably , by exchanging @xmath41 and @xmath45 in expression the functional so obtained allows to measure the chemical potential of the system .",
    "this fact shows a further `` esthetic advantage '' of the boltzmann entropy : it leads to expressions formally identical independently from the number of conserved quantities . _",
    "in a statistical description of a many - body system , temperature has a different meaning depending on the statistical ensemble . in the canonical ensemble and in the grand - canonical one ,",
    "( inverse ) temperature is just a lagrangian parameter that is introduced in order to fix the mean energy . on the contrary , in the microcanonical ensemble",
    "the temperature is a quantity derived from the entropy density @xmath56 , according to the relation @xmath57 .",
    "therefore it is clear that @xmath58 will depend on the entropy definition assumed within the microcanonical statistical description .",
    "the main point here is that the meaning of temperature can not be reduced to the issue of the coherent definition inside to microcanonical ensemble , at least if there is equivalence of ensembles . in the latter case",
    ", one expects that temperature , or more in general thermodynamics , defined for a system by two microscopic models , for instance canonical and microcanonical , coincide in the thermodynamic limit and they coincide with the experimentally known thermodynamics of such system @xcite .",
    "this amounts to requiring that the thermodynamics of a large isolated ( microcanonical ) system and the thermodynamics of a `` small '' ( even if big enough ) subsystem of it coincide . in fact , in the thermodynamic limit , the complement of the subsystem , acts on it as a thermostat and the subsystem is well described in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the problem of equivalence of ensembles is only incompletely solved @xcite , for instance it is known that systems with long - range interaction can violate this equivalence .",
    "in fact , for this class of systems the energy is not extensive : a system can not be divided into independent macroscopic parts at variance of the case of the short - range interaction . in the following we show that if there is equivalence between statistical ensembles , helmholtz free energy density is the legendre transform of boltzmann entropy density and vice versa .",
    "consequently , thermodynamics derived for a systems by boltzmann entropy and by canonical partition function rigorously coincide in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we consider this as a strong evidence supporting the legitimacy of the boltzmann entropy .",
    "let us now discuss about a case where there is not equivalence between canonical and microcanonical ensembles .",
    "this is the case of a system with long - range interaction that undergoes a first - order phase transition .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details . in summary",
    "the boltzmann entropy for a system with these features is not a concave function , consequently it can not be the legendre transformation of the helmholtz free - energy density , and @xmath59 is a not - invertible function . in cases like this ,",
    "the canonical ensemble has not foundation since it can not be derived from the microcanonical ensemble , unlike the case of the extensive systems @xcite , where it can .",
    "therefore , the case of the long - range interactions are outside the class of systems to which our proof applies , although we consider boltzmann entropy the correct definition also for this class of systems .    in the following",
    "we will consider two explicit systems , one of which has two conserved quantities , accordingly in this section we give our proof for a system with this feature .",
    "the restriction of our derivation to the case of a system where energy is the sole conserved quantity is straightforward .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary classical many - body hamiltonian system with @xmath38 first integrals of motion , @xmath41 and a further conserved quantity @xmath45 which is in involution with @xmath41 .",
    "in order to compare the canonical and the microcanonical description for such class of systems , we decompose the canonical partition function as follows @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the minimum and the maximum of the admitted energy density @xmath63 , respectively and _ @xmath64 is exactly boltzmann s microcanonical entropy density_. furthermore , note that we have made use of the generalization @xcite of the co - area formula @xcite which is of very general validity and holds also for hausdorff measurable sets .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in eq .",
    "( [ c2mc2 ] ) @xmath65 represents just a ( lagrangian ) parameter and it is only thanks to the comparison between canonical and microcanonical ensemble that one can ascribe to @xmath65 the meaning of inverse temperature @xcite . in order to connect the canonical description to the microcanonical description one",
    "has to observe that , roughly speaking , the partition function @xmath66 depends on the competition between the two terms @xmath67 and @xmath68 which are exponentially decreasing and increasing with @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "thus , by the saddle point / laplace method , the following asymptotic approximation ( @xmath69 ) for the partition function holds @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the solution of @xmath73 therefore the canonical free energy @xmath74 is @xmath75 where @xmath65 and @xmath76 are related by eq .",

    "this fact shows that whenever there is equivalence between the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble , _ the only consistent definition for the microcanonical temperature is the boltzmanns_.    it is worth remarking a general scenario in which negative temperatures emerge . from eqs . and it follows @xmath80 thus when @xmath14 has a local maximum at @xmath81 by using the laplace method we deduce the following asymptotic approximate ( @xmath69 ) expressions @xmath82 which , in the thermodynamic limit , yields @xmath83 _ the peculiar behaviour just here summarized shows in which way the gibbs entropy and the boltzmann entropy are inequivalent in the thermodynamic limit in the case of systems that allow negative boltzmann temperatures_.",
    "in the present section , we focus on what we consider the heart of the matter about the issue of the correct microcanonical entropy definition . in ref .",

    "@xmath86 are intensive parameters of the hamiltonian density @xmath87 and @xmath88 denotes the microcanonical average calculated via the density operator @xmath89 therefore , the criticism of the thermodynamic consistency of the boltzmann entropy raised in ref .",
    "@xcite concerned the fact that the gibbs entropy ( @xmath90 ) satisfies both the identities and whereas boltzmann entropy ( @xmath91 ) does not satisfy .",
    "in this section we prove that the boltzmann entropy is thermostatistically consistent .",
    "we show that eq .",
    "is not a fundamental condition and it should not be satisfied in general in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "we also demonstrate that the gibbs entropy is inconsistent with a different known thermostatistical condition relating the generalized pressure and the free energy .",
    "we finally emphasize that the entropy @xmath56 , defined as the primitive associated with the clausius integrating factor , coincides with @xmath92 .      in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that eq . stems from the correct identification between thermodynamic quantities and statistical expectation values .",
    "in particular , eq . is derived by matching the thermodynamical ( generalized ) pressure @xmath93 ( rhs . of eq . ) to the microcanonical average @xmath94 ( rhs . of eq . ) .",
    "therefore , since only the gibbs entropy satisfies eq . in @xcite it is concluded that the boltzmann entropy is inconsistent .",
    "we prove here that eq . is a mathematical property of gibbs entropy but not a general consistency condition for the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble . in particular we prove that in general @xmath95    two generalized force / pressure definitions are proposed in literature : @xmath96 and @xmath97 the former is derived from the thermodynamic maxwell relations @xcite , the latter is also generally proposed in text books @xcite and it is essentially extrapolated from calculations performed on free - particle systems confined in a box . in the following we show that in the general case that includes systems with negative boltzmann temperatures the correct definition is the first one eq . .",
    "this fact entails that the issues of inconsistency ascribed to the boltzmann entropy lose validity .",

    "@xcite si it has been argued that a dynamically - adiabatic process , described by the hamilton - heisenberg equations , is an adiabatic process also in the conventional thermodynamic sense , that is an isentropic process .",
    "therefore , by comparing the microscopically - derived relation with the standard thermodynamical relations for some thermodynamic adiabatic process ( @xmath109 ) @xmath110 one gets @xmath111 from which the pressure definition comes .",
    "+ however , only for a restricted class of systems dynamically - adiabatic processes are adiabatic also in the conventional thermodynamic sense .",
    "in fact , in the general case , one has to consider systems with hamiltonians containing both a ( density ) kinetic term @xmath112 and a potential one @xmath45 .",

    "the usual answer to this question given by the supporters of the gibbs entropy is to use the equipartition theorem .",

    "_ we conclude that the identity can not be advocated as proof in favour of gibbs entropy , since it is not valid in the case of systems where gibbs and boltzmann disagree .",
    "the correct identity , shows that there is not equipartition .",
    "furthermore , since eq .",
    "is not valid , it can not used to measure the gibbs temperature as a microcanonical average_.",
    "making a temperature measurement on a system brings about , inevitably , a contact between the system and a second `` small system '' . especially in the present context",
    "a particular care has to be employed when we choose a second calibrated system ( thermometer ) to attach to the first one ( sample ) in order to determine the temperature of the latter .",
    "the thermometer has to detect the sample temperature without destroying its equilibrium .",
    "this means that a thermometer capable of sustaining negative temperatures must be employed with a sample admitting negative temperatures .",
    "indeed , the whole system , obtained by glueing together a `` small '' system with unbounded energies , like an harmonic oscillator , to the sample would be a system with unbounded energies , that is without negative temperatures .",
    "in other words , a `` small '' system with unbounded energies will be able to detect only the positive temperatures .",
    "this aspect that appears as a good reasoning , has been diffusely discussed by ramsey in its paper @xcite even if several authors @xcite seem to have missed this point .",
    "furthermore , it makes sense to ask oneself if ( and how ) two systems admitting negative temperatures reach equilibrium when joined together at an initial different temperature .",
    "in particular , a relevant question is whether the two joined systems reach eventually the same inverse temperature and if , or not , this latter is intermediate respect to the initial inverse temperatures of the two systems as we expect from statistical mechanics of positive temperatures @xcite . in order to directly verify if the boltzmann temperature complies with this requisite , we have simulated an experiment in which two different systems that admit negative temperatures , at different initial temperatures , are brought to contact with each other .",
    "thus we have considered two systems described by the following hamiltonians @xmath288 where , for each system , the indices @xmath289 and @xmath290 run over a two - dimensional lattice and @xmath291 is the adjacency matrix that describes the nearest - neighbour interaction in two spatial dimensions . in",

    "we have prepared the initial configuration of equilibrium for the two systems at different temperatures ( @xmath292 , @xmath293 ) , by means of a long time integration of the equations of motion of the two separated systems . the inverse temperatures @xmath292 ( @xmath293 ) , have been measured with eq .",

    "[ thermalization ] we report the inverse temperature for the whole system ( black ) , subsystem @xmath299 ( blue ) and subsystem @xmath300 ( red ) .",
    "as it was expected , we observe that the inverse temperature of the whole system , after a short transient , reaches an asymptotic value @xmath301 intermediate between the initial values of the inverse temperatures of the two original systems .",
    "also , the inverse temperatures of the two subsystems approach the value of @xmath302 along the time . furthermore",
    ", this value remains stable on long time scales .",
    "for detail about these numerical results we refer to @xcite , where we have presente analytical and numerical evidence that boltzmann microcanonical entropy allows the description of phase transitions occurring at ( negative boltzmann temperatures ) high energy densities , at variance with gibbs temperature .",
    "it is worth remarking that , whereas this process of thermalization is well explained with the boltzmann temperature , we can not say the same for the inverse temperature of gibbs for which it is @xmath303 with @xmath298 and @xmath304 .      and @xmath300 after that they are attached at initially different inverse temperatures .",
    "the black line is the evolution of the inverse temperature of the whole system , the blue line is the inverse temperature of system @xmath299 and the red line is the inverse temperature of the subsystem @xmath300 .",
    "the inset shows a zoom of the last part of evolution.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally we have verified that , irrespective of the sign of the temperature , a large lattice ( that realizes a microcanonical ensemble ) acts as a thermostat for a small sublattice ( that realizes a grand canonical ensemble ) and that the temperatures measures for the two systems agree , thus confirming the equivalence between the the microcanonical and the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we have addressed the question of the right definition of microcanonical entropy .    for systems for which the equivalence of the statistical ensembles is verified",
    "we have shown that the correct map between the canonical average of the energy ( also for systems with one or more conserved quantities ) and the lagrangian parameter @xmath65 is that descending from the boltzmann entropy . moreover , we have concluded that the only consistent definition for the microcanonical entropy is that of boltzmann .",
    "in fact , while for standard systems both these entropies lead to equivalent thermodynamic results in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , in the case of systems with bounded energy spectrum , negative boltzmann temperatures are admitted , and the two microcanonical entropies lead to irreconciliable results . in particular ,",
    "when the latter circumstance is verified , the inverse temperature derived by the gibbs entropy coincides with the one of boltzmann within the region of energy density where the latter is positive , and is identically null where the boltzmann temperature is negative . in this way",
    ", it could happen that in correspondence of the energies where @xmath219 changes sign , @xmath36 is not a differentiable function of @xmath3 . but",
    "this conflicts with the fact that the canonical and grand canonical partition functions are smooth functions of @xmath3 in correspondence of such points . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath59 is a smooth function of @xmath3 , and no consistence issue of this kind arises for boltzmann entropy .    for a general system",

    ", that has been adduced as thermostatistical self - consistency condition for entropy @xcite , actually is not a fundamental condition for the microcanonical entropy ; iii ) the gibbs entropy is inconsistent with the thermostatistical condition that relates the generalized pressure and the free energy .",
    "for all these reasons we conclude that the correct definition for the microcanonical entropy is the one of boltzmann .",
