    "the appearance of several startling examples of superconductivity in the past six year or so is prompting re - evaluation of our thinking about the one pairing mechanism for which there is a precise and controlled theoretical foundation , to wit , phonon - mediated coupling .",
    "this strong - coupling migdal - eliashberg ( me ) theory , formalized in detail by scalapino , schrieffer , and wilkins,@xcite has had numerous successes in the _ quantitative _ description of the frequency dependence of the complex superconducting gap function , the deviation of the critical field from its weak - coupling analytic form , etc .",
    "its implementation has not been so precise in predicting the critical temperature t@xmath0 because the retarded coulomb repulsion @xmath2 is difficult to calculate ; nevertheless the underlying theory of t@xmath0 is understood to be in good shape .",
    "so a question arises : when we have a material - specific , quantitative theory that works , why is it that we are nearly always surprised by the most interesting new cases of `` unusually high t@xmath0 superconductivity '' ( uhts ) , which here we will consider to be around 20 k or higher .",
    "( the high t@xmath0 cuprates , the real hts materials , are a separate class and will not be considered here . ) in this paper we will attempt to clarify issues that are involved in several of these uhts materials , and to illuminate some of issues in the _ understanding _ of the me theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a generalized conceptualization of some of the new surprises .",
    "the aim is not , unfortunately , to predict the next breakthrough , as the title misleadingly implies , although a provocative limit will be mentioned .",
    "one relevant system that will not be addressed here is the fulleride superconductors a@xmath3c@xmath4 , with values of t@xmath0 up to 40 k being achieved.@xcite there is an enormous literature on this system , with many of the important papers being cited in a recent review.@xcite it is rather unfortunate that we do not have the space - time nor the energy to include fullerides , as some of its important characteristics overlap strongly with those we discuss here .",
    "there are however correlation effects that complicate the theoretical description , and therefore the comparison , with materials discussed here , and it would not be prudent to draw parallels or contrasts in this paper .    for different reasons no discussion of pucoga@xmath5 ( with its surprising t@xmath0=18 k)@xcite will be included .",
    "this heavy - fermion uhts is a very different kind of material than any that will be discussed in this article , and no doubt requires a very different theoretical approach .",
    "the discovery by akimitsu s group@xcite in 2001 of t@xmath0 = 40 k in mgb@xmath1 was unimaginable within the context of conventional understanding at the time , as will be elaborated further in this paper .",
    "the measurement of the boron isotope shift@xcite quickly established a phonon mechanism , and the structural and electronic simplicity allowed many groups to dive into study of the mechanism .",
    "the understanding of the mechanism arose quickly@xcite and is in reasonable quantitative agreement with data .",
    "the truly remarkable aspect of this queen of superconductivity s personality traits is her complete and utter scorn for the conventional wisdom of phonon - coupled superconductivity ( `` matthias s rules '' ) .",
    "_ broken rule # 1 : _",
    "mgb@xmath1 is not cubic nor is it close , and this is one of its key characteristics .",
    "the all - important @xmath6 band is ( quasi ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) , so although it is rather lightly ( self-)doped with holes , its density of states is comparable to what it would be with heavier doping . in addition",
    ", the @xmath7 bonding in the b graphene layer provides it with stronger bonds than if it had three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath8 bonds .",
    "this distinction in @xmath7 versus @xmath8 bonding is why graphite is more strongly bound than is diamond .",
    "_ broken rule # 2 : _ there are no @xmath9 electrons ; previous emphasis was on intermetallic compounds , _ viz .",
    "_ nb@xmath10sn , where @xmath9 electrons played the central role .",
    "mgb@xmath1 takes advantage of the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath8 bonds are the strongest in nature , stronger than the @xmath11 bonds in transition metal compounds that had ruled the conventional superconductivity roost .",
    "the strong bonds lead to extremely large electron - phonon matrix elements ; we return to this below .",
    "_ broken rule # 3 : _ there is no special e / a ( _ electron / atom _ ) ratio that tunes the fermi level to a peak in the density of states n(e ) , because n(e ) has no peaks and furthermore its magnitude is embarrassingly modest .",
    "mgb@xmath1 exchanges large n(e ) for very large matrix elements .",
    "this rule of large n(e@xmath12 ) is justified by the expression for the coupling strength @xmath13 , @xmath14 with the other quantities being the mean square electron - phonon matrix element @xmath15 averaged over the fermi surface , the ion mass @xmath16 , and the mean square renormalized ( physical ) phonon frequency .",
    "( it will not be necessary for the purpose of this paper to delve into the complexities that arise in compounds with more than a single type of atom . )",
    "since t@xmath0 increases monotonically with @xmath13 ( all other characteristics kept fixed ) and clearly it is proportional to n(e@xmath12 ) , then a higher density of states is desirable .",
    "[ we point out below the incorrectness of this argument ; @xmath17 also depends on n(e@xmath12 ) . ]    _ the rule of light elements .",
    "_ this rule was not included in the conventional list , because it was not clear there was any real correlation between t@xmath0 and mass in the best intermetallic superconductors ; nb@xmath10sn was as good a nb@xmath10al , for example , and a little better than the much lighter v@xmath10si .",
    "theoretically , however , it was accepted that having a high energy boson doing the coupling [ t@xmath18exp(-1/@xmath13 ) ] provides a higher energy scale , and therefore lends hope for driving t@xmath0 skyward .",
    "metallic hydrogen is the limiting case ( barring the formation of a condensed system of muonium atoms , for which the @xmath19 lifetime becomes an issue ) .",
    "ashcroft s prediction 35 years ago that it would be a high temperature superconductor@xcite remains unverified , but also remains unretracted . a recent compilation of the values of t@xmath0 for elemental metals@xcite shows the high values to be concentrated toward the low mass end of the spectrum .",
    "a more microscopically based overview of the interrelationships between large susceptibilities [ n(e@xmath12 ) , @xmath20 , large matrix elements , strong interatomic forces , and atomic masses was provided by allen,@xcite who also focused on the limitations posed by structural instabilities as coupling became too strong .",
    "what is sobering to recognize is that the behavior of mgb@xmath1 lies within conventional migdal - eliashberg theory ; it was only our biases ( as codified in matthias s rules ) that mgb@xmath1 abused .",
    "what mgb@xmath1 really did in spectacular fashion was to violate a rule we probably were often not consciously aware that we followed ( although we certainly `` understood '' it ) .",
    "+ _ broken unwritten rule a. _ the unwritten rule , the `` eleventh commandment '' of successful electron - phonon systems , can be phrased as _",
    "thou shalt not put all of thine eggs into one basket_. successful electron - phonon coupling system should refrain from being too pushy , the coupling had to be spread out over most ( preferably all ) phonons , _",
    "i.e. _ many baskets . extremely strong coupling to any given phonon was the recipe for banishment from superconducting materials , via structural instability .",
    "the decomposition of the coupling strength @xmath13 into contributions from individual phonons ( mode @xmath13 s , @xmath21 ) by allen@xcite made the connection clearer , and has also been the key to understanding coupling strength in the uhtss .",
    "this _ many - baskets _ rule was not so clearly codified but nevertheless was quite clear : there were several examples where coupling strength got unusually strong at certain values ( or localized regions ) of phonon wavevector q. the phonon branch softened , as parameters were twiddled to increase the coupling the phonon became unstable , and this enhanced t@xmath0 . certainly these softened branches correlated closely with increased t@xmath0 , and there was a manifestation of the increased strength of the coupling",
    "the first instance was probably the tac - hfc pair measured by smith and glaser@xcite , and was followed by the nb@xmath10sn - nb@xmath10sb distinction.@xcite the theory provided understanding of these connections , and also the means@xcite to obtain the enhancement of the coupling ( as long as anharmonic corrections were not important ) .",
    "if the renormalization became too strong , however , the compound transformed to a structure with weaker coupling ( peierls - type distortion due to strong kohn anomaly , or a band jahn - teller transformation if n(e@xmath12 ) became too large ) , or the structure would not form at all ( `` covalent instability '' ) .",
    "mgb@xmath1 made , to put it kindly , fools of those of us who believed that focusing of coupling strength into a few modes was folly .",
    "[ the author was a fervent believer in this ` evident truth . ' ] only two of the nine phonon branches are strongly coupled , these being the doubly degenerate b - b bond - stretching modes in the 2d layers . and of these branches , only those with @xmath22 are strongly coupled , and this set comprises only 12% of the area of the zone .",
    "thus only 3% of the mgb@xmath1 s phonons are carrying the load , with `` mode @xmath21 '' values of @xmath2320 - 25 ; the other 97% have values two orders of magnitude smaller and serve mainly to complicate the analysis and confuse the understanding , which is actually exceedingly simple . neglecting these ( 97% ) dismal wannabes , a very good estimate of the coupling strength can be obtained with a handful of easy computations and the back of a clean standard - size envelope.@xcite    the explanation is most easily visible in the calculation of the phonon spectrum of hole - doped libc , whose crystal and electronic structure is much like those of mgb@xmath1 ( as are the predicted phonon anomalies@xcite ) except the matrix elements are even larger .",
    "the phonon dispersion curves , before and after hole - doping , are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the enormous kohn anomalies are sharper than those published for mgb@xmath1 , possibly because it is a little more 2d - like , but more so because the phonon momentum grid used in the calculation is much denser than has been done for mgb@xmath1 .",
    "just as simple considerations based on the circular fermi surface suggest , renormalization is confined to @xmath24 , but the strength of renormalization is unprecedented . the extreme phonon softening and broadening , and",
    "the sharp kohn anomalies , have been experimentally verified in mgb@xmath1.@xcite    predictions of the sort that give realistic values for mgb@xmath1 suggest that in li@xmath3bc , t@xmath0 could be as much as twice as high.@xcite li@xmath3bc was reported a decade ago by worl _ at al._,@xcite but was not checked for superconductivity .",

    "why is nt it 60 k , or 100 k ?",
    "is it within the realm of possibility that an mgb@xmath1-type material could be a room temperature superconductor ?",
    "it is worthwhile to pursue this line of reasoning , neglecting for the time being that the biggest lesson that history has taught us is that every qualitative jump in t@xmath0 does not result from scientific scheming but , maddeningly , simply from serendipity .",
    "[ examples : high t@xmath0 cuprates ; fullerides ; mgb@xmath1 . in none of these systems was the remarkable superconductivity foreseen .",
    "the exception : t@xmath0 up to 35 k in ( ba , k)bio@xmath10 was actually the outgrowth of systematic scientific scheming at bell labs by mattheiss and coworkers.@xcite ]    [ trends ]   with variation of chosen characteristics of mgb@xmath1 . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   with variation of chosen characteristics of mgb@xmath1 . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    fortunately , mgb@xmath1 did not break the essential rule for good electron - phonon coupled superconductors : that migdal - eliashberg theory provides the description of not only t@xmath0 but the wavevector and frequency dependence of the superconducting gap .",
    "the underlying theory is still the one we understand , so one can pursue the theoretical game of varying specific materials characteristics individually , do learn what their influence is .",
    "one of the first issues to consider , and one not directly related to matthias s rules , is the doping dependence of @xmath13 and t@xmath0 .",
    "this dependence arises mainly from the scale @xmath29 of the fermi surface ( we neglect the renormalization of interatomic forces and bands ) .",
    "an analytic ( front of the envelope ) calculation leads to the results pictured in fig . 2 and the remarkable implications .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath21 is confined to @xmath22 and decreases as @xmath29 ( hole doping ) increases .",
    "however , the phase space , that is , the fermi surface volume , increases in exactly a manner that leaves @xmath13 itself constant : the total coupling strength is independent of the doping level .",
    "the next result , directly following , is that the phonon renormalization does not change , even though an increasing fraction of the phonons are renormalized .",
    "thus simple doping changes the number of phonons that are renormalized ( following the _ many - baskets _ theme ) but the mode @xmath13 s are decreased , so doping is ineffective in effecting an increase in t@xmath0 in a system like mgb@xmath1 .",
    "the first broken rule , about symmetry of the crystal structure , can not be fixed in a continuous way , since the hexagonal structure of mgb@xmath1 can not be morphed into a cubic counterpart in any way that provide a useful comparison ( although a quasi-2d electronic structure may be connected continuously to a 3d one ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath30 electrons can not be squeezed continuously into @xmath9 electrons , again a question of symmetry .",
    "the queen has violated these two rules in a nonnegotiable fashion , as in a royal decree .",
    "the third rule does involve a variable quantity , n(e@xmath12 ) , which _ can _ be changed by varying the effective mass @xmath31 or by encountering a non - parabolic dispersion relation .",
    "however , @xmath15 enters the equations multiplied by n(e@xmath12 ) so they can be considered together .",
    "it gets better than that : the unrenormalized phonon frequency @xmath32 enters similarly , except in the form of its inverse square .",
    "simply put , once phonon renormalization in this 2d system has been incorporated , one can express@xcite @xmath13 in terms of the intrinsic material parameters encapsulated in @xmath33 : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the band ( fermi surface ) degeneracy ; for mgb@xmath1 there are two fermi surfaces @xmath36 and a reward of @xmath37=4 .    with this form we can consider the variation of @xmath33 to be due to variation of n(e@xmath12 ) , @xmath15 , or @xmath35 . keeping in mind the frequency prefactor in the equation for t@xmath0 , which is the renormalized frequency ( and",
    "depends on @xmath33 in a known way ) , the change in t@xmath0 can be obtained . for numerical realism in the strong coupling regime",
    "we are probing , we must use instead of the mcmillan equation the allen - dynes equation,@xcite which gives the correct strong - coupling limit @xmath38 .",
    "for the results we present in eq . 3 ,",
    "@xmath2 has been adjusted to provide the reference value t@xmath0 = 40 k for mgb@xmath1 when first - principles results are used for the other quantities . [",
    "the alb@xmath1 phonon frequency @xmath32 = 1050 @xmath39 was taken as the unrenormalized frequency . ]",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "3 shows , in addition to the trivial but instructive behavior of @xmath40 , the variation of t@xmath0 as @xmath37 n(e@xmath12 ) @xmath15 is varied , _",
    "i.e. _ varying @xmath33 at fixed @xmath32 .",
    "it is seen that a higher band mass , or larger matrix element , can increase t@xmath0 by only @xmath2330% to 55 k ( where @xmath41 7 - 8 ) ; at this point the renormalized frequency crashes toward zero and in spite of a divergent @xmath13 ( achieved by a vanishing denominator @xmath42 ) t@xmath0 drops to zero .",
    "the other variation to consider is that of keeping the electronic characteristics fixed by varying the unrenormalized frequency .",
    "it is found that reducing @xmath32 initially leads to an increase in t@xmath0 , but after only a 15% increase at around @xmath43 900 @xmath39 ( again , @xmath44 ) , at which point the renormalized frequency again comes crashing down and t@xmath0 vanishes .",
    "strictly , it seems in both cases that t@xmath0 does not vanish before the system becomes unstable .",
    "what we see is that our old conventional picture finally wins out : increased coupling strength leads to instability after only a rather modest enhancement of t@xmath0 for the case of mgb@xmath1 .",
    "the queen loses her head after all .",
    "so , is there no way to win , no scenario that gives room temperature superconductivity ?",
    "the lesson of fig .",
    "3 really is that the instability limit @xmath45 1 must be avoided , and at least in these scenarios the ultra - strong coupling t@xmath46 scaling,@xcite derived for fixed frequencies , is not part of the parameter space .",
    "however , if @xmath33 can be kept near its optimum value of 0.9 and the frequency ( prefactor ) increased , then there is no limitation on the increase .",
    "this situation might be obtained in two ways .",
    "one is to increase the numerator and denominator of @xmath33 proportionately ; make the electronic coupling stronger while also making the underlying ( unrenormalized ) lattice stiffer .",
    "the increase in t@xmath0 then follows the increase in the frequency prefactor , which although renormalized is still increasing .",
    "mgb@xmath1 , and b - doped diamond even more so , capitalize on a stiff underlying lattice , but hard lattices are limited at around the diamond example .",
    "the alternative is to apply pressure , and indeed pressure is seen to enhance t@xmath0 impressively in many systems .",
    "the other possibility , based on the fact that @xmath42 is actually a force constant and is mass independent ( hence @xmath33 is mass independent ) , is to fix all material parameters and simply reduce the nuclear masses .",
    "this is really the `` metallic hydrogen '' limit mentioned above , and such variation of masses via isotope substitution is quite limited in practice .",
    "although b - doped diamond does not ( yet ) fit our @xmath2320 k criterion as a uhts , it is quite instructive to consider it because of its relationship to mgb@xmath1 .",
    "diamond , doped at the 2 - 4% level by boron , has been shown@xcite to be superconducting up to 11 k in bulk or thin film form .",
    "application of me theory , presuming that the material is a degenerate p - type semiconductor , shows@xcite strong electron - phonon coupling of a magnitude that will account for its observed t@xmath0 .",
    "arpes data has verified that the fermi level indeed lies within the diamond valence bands at the expected energy@xcite rather than in an impurity band as has been speculated.@xcite    the calculations show this system to be a 3d analog of mgb@xmath1 ; indeed one of the papers is so titled.@xcite holes are doped into the strongly bonding states , which are very strongly coupled to the c - c bond stretch modes  just the story of the high t@xmath0 in mgb@xmath1 . in terms of the quantities involved in the coupling of mgb@xmath1 ( above ) , the comparison is the following . the unrenormalized frequency , the 1330 @xmath39 mode of diamond , is higher than its mgb@xmath1 analog ( the raman mode of alb@xmath1 at 1050 @xmath39 ; thus the lattice is stiffer.@xcite the @xmath15 matrix elements are larger than in mgb@xmath1 , due again to the shorter stronger c - c bond compared to b - b . yet the renormalized frequency , @xmath47 1000 @xmath39 remains higher than that of mgb@xmath1 ; this is the prefactor in the t@xmath0 equation and also is good .",
    "the only shortcoming , and a severe one , is that diamond is 3d , which means that the n(e)@xmath48 increases slowly with doping below the band edge @xmath49 . as a result n(e@xmath12 ) is much smaller than in mgb@xmath1 , by about a factor of four .",
    "the unexpected superconductivity of mgb@xmath1 is perhaps matched by the subsequent discovery that the free - electron metal li , upon being subjected to 35 - 50 gpa pressure , corresponding to a volume of only 40 - 50% of its zero pressure value , becomes superconducting@xcite at up to 20 k. since the upper limit of t@xmath0 in li at ambient pressure has been decreased@xcite to 100 @xmath50k , this increase represents at least a five order of magnitude due to pressure .",
    "this 20 k value gives li the highest t@xmath0 among elemental superconductors .",
    "how can it happen that a simple @xmath51-electron metal , still in a simple close - packed structure ( fcc ) suggestive of conventional metallic bonding , can produce the strength of electron - phonon coupling that is necessary , as two studies now are showing.@xcite    those papers can be consulted for the details , but the basic physics goes like this .",
    "reduction of the atomic volume by a factor of @xmath232 does nt produce enormous changes in the band structure ; the new , and crucial , feature is the appearance and growth in size of necks joining spherical fermi surfaces along @xmath52 directions , as for the well known fermi surface of cu",
    ". there is also flattening ( with respect to spherical ) of the fermi surfaces between the necks that has some import ; see below .",
    "these necks also develop primarily @xmath53 character , thus li is transforming from an @xmath51 electron metal into an @xmath54 metal .",
    "this @xmath30 character provides at least the possibility of some directional , ` covalent ' character to the bonding , with the possibility that this may enhance electron - phonon coupling .    with the increase of pressure in the 20 - 38 gpa range where the fcc phase is stable",
    ", the transverse t@xmath55 branch of the phonon spectrum ( and only this branch ) softens and becomes harmonically unstable around 25 - 30 gpa,@xcite reflecting the renormalization that results from strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "searching through the phonon scattering processes from / to the fermi surface , which is quantified by the `` nesting function ''",
    "@xmath56 reveals that the fairly innocuous looking fermi surface geometry actually focuses the phase space for scattering processes into a few regions,@xcite including the one ( q near the zone boundary k point ) where the phonon branch becomes unstable .",
    "the regions where the mode @xmath57 5 have also been mapped,@xcite and they appear to coincide with the regions of intensity in @xmath58 .    what has this enormous , and unanticipated , increase in t@xmath0 with pressure in li to tell us about the bigger picture ? ( 1 ) li is cubic here , with the simplest of structures , so there is no low - dimensionality effect operating here . ( 2 ) li is an @xmath54 electron material at reduced volume , a quality in common with mgb@xmath1 .",
    "( 3 ) the electron - phonon coupling strength is _ not _ driven by a large n(e@xmath12 ) , again similar to mgb@xmath1 . ( 4 ) very much like mgb@xmath1 , li obtains its coupling strength from a relatively small fraction of the phonons : the region around @xmath59 has strongest coupling , but only to phonons with transverse polarization @xmath60 . in the case of li",
    ", however , the sharp structure in q of the coupling strength does drive the system to structural instability , at least in harmonic approximation .",
    "thus the mechanism driving the increase in t@xmath0 is self - limiting already at experimental conditions as the conventional theory@xcite would lead one to expect .",
    "current data suggest , however , that the high t@xmath0 survives the structural change at 40 gpa , and displays somewhat higher t@xmath0 in the higher pressure phase.@xcite",

    "bill and coworkers have suggested@xcite that an electronic mechanism may be operating ; still there is the zr@xmath75hf question to address .",
    "ba@xmath78k@xmath3bio@xmath10 ( bkbo ) , with t@xmath0 up to 35 k reported,@xcite has been relatively heavily studied with no resolution of the source of its impressive superconductivity .",
    "the parent compound babio@xmath10 is a distorted perovskite with two inequivalent bi sites , often interpreted formally as bi@xmath79 ( 6@xmath80 `` lone pair '' configuration ) and bi@xmath81 ( closed shell ion ) .",
    "extensive electronic structure studies find very little actual charge difference between the sites , but these same local density functional studies are also unable to describe the ground state structural properties as well as can usually be done for an @xmath54 electron system ( the valence - conduction orbitals are o @xmath53 and bi @xmath82 ) .    a density functional linear response calculation of the phonon spectrum , electron - phonon coupling , and t@xmath0 by meregalli and savrasov@xcite failed to find an explanation of the superconductivity .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath13=0.34 was found , well below the required strength .",
    "possible resolutions include ( 1 ) electron correlation , although how to approach it is an open question ( see below ) , ( 2 ) unconventional types of coupling to the lattice ; after all , this system superconducts best near a structural phase boundary , ( 3 ) alloy issues ( clustering or other short - range order ) , which could make the virtual crystal treatment of the electronic structure inapplicable , or ( 4 ) focusing of phonon scattering processes as in li , which makes it numerically taxing to carry out the q - integration to convergence to obtain the precise value of @xmath13",
    ". the rounded cube fermi surface does suggest nesting that could make alternative ( 4 ) worth revisiting .",
    "one course of action is to look for correlations beyond lda in this system .",
    "the focus is on the bi cation and its tendency to favor the singlet - paired @xmath83 configuration if electrons are available , and the lack of any magnetic behavior .",
    "this has been addressed in terms of a `` negative u '' interaction@xcite on the bi ion , but a microscopic investigation into this possibility failed to turn up evidence for such interaction.@xcite      there are a few other systems which fall under our classification as uhts materials , but are as yet little understood .    * c@xmath1 dumbbell systems . * the cubic compound y@xmath1c@xmath10 , consisting of a bcc structure with y occupying rather low symmetry @xmath84 sites , and with interstitial dumbbells of c@xmath1 molecules oriented along each of the cubic axes , superconducts@xcite at 18 k when synthesized at high pressure . keeping in mind mgb@xmath1 and b - doped diamond ( and fulleride systems ) with their strong coupling to high frequency b / c modes ,",
    "it is natural to focus on the unusual c@xmath1 dumbbells , which are essentially triple - bonded carbon molecules lying in the background electron gas provided by the y carriers .",
    "band structure calculations@xcite indicate a modest value of n(e@xmath12 ) , but with an intriguing flat band very close to e@xmath12 in a limited region of the brillouin zone .",
    "singh and mazin calculate@xcite a c - c stretch mode frequency of 1442 @xmath39 , higher than that of diamond .",
    "its mode @xmath21 was only about 10% of that from the y mode they studied .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that coupling to a high frequency mode is more valuable for t@xmath0 than coupling to a soft mode . while it is suggested@xcite that phonons may provide the coupling in this system , the most distinctive feature of the structure , the c - c molecular dumbbells , does not seem to be a dominant force in the impressive value of t@xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the existing information is for only two phonons at a single q value in a system with 60 branches , and recent experience teaches that as little as a few percent of the modes may drive t@xmath0 up to 30 - 40 k. unfortunately , with 20 atoms in the primitive cell it is unlikely that full electron - phonon coupling calculations can be carried out in the near future .",
    "another dumbbell system is the class y@xmath1c@xmath1@xmath85@xmath1 , where @xmath85 is a negative halide ion ( i , br ) , with t@xmath0 up@xcite to 11.5 k. as for the y@xmath1c@xmath10 systems , a c - c derived band lies very close@xcite to the fermi level .",
    "again as for y@xmath1c@xmath10 , it is unknown whether this band contributes strong electron - phonon coupling that drives the superconductivity in this system .",
    "* ba@xmath1nb@xmath5o@xmath3 , banbo@xmath86 . * materials in this class are reported to have t@xmath0 as high@xcite as high as 22 k. values are strongly sample dependent , but t@xmath0 up to 18 k seems to be reproducible .",
    "the structure that is suggested to be responsible for the highest t@xmath0 is a perovskite oxynitride banbo@xmath3n@xmath87 . in view of the enormous number of non - superconducting perovskite oxides",
    ", this could be a particularly significant achievement if it can be confirmed .",
    "* ypd@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "* this compound is the highest t@xmath0 member ( 23 k)@xcite of the class of mostly ni compounds@xcite that have been studied most extensively because of the competition between magnetism ( due to magnetic rare earths in place of y ) and superconductivity .",
    "this compound may be regarded as containing c - b - c trimers that link ypd@xmath1 layers .",
    "indications from a rigid - potential treatment@xcite suggests the light atoms provide a majority of the coupling strength , but this tentative conclusion needs to be confirmed by more complete calculations .",
    "the primary theme of this paper , if one can be claimed , has been ( a ) to discuss how mgb@xmath1 and a few other uhts systems succeed in achieving impressive t@xmath0 by breaking old rules , and ( b ) to give some thought to the possibility of extending the positive attributes of these new and different superconductors .",
    "one observation is that mgb@xmath1 puts all its reliance ( coupling ) on only a small fraction @xmath233% of its phonons .",
    "this works , as far as it goes . by varying various materials properties , we find there is no more than 20 - 30% to be gained in this type of system by increasing the raw coupling strength [ n(e@xmath12)@xmath15 ] , also not much to be gained by starting with a stiffer system , and also that changes in the hole - concentration are ineffective for raising t@xmath0 . increasing raw coupling _",
    "proportionately _ with the stiffness of the underlying unrenormalized material is a possible avenue for increasing t@xmath0 .",
    "however , we are reaching the limits of stiff systems at ambient pressure .",
    "thinking practically , application of such hard materials brings additional headaches  think of the prospect of winding your electromagnet coils with diamond wire .",
    "[ fs_arrows ]     this line of pursuit may not quite be hopeless .",
    "since mgb@xmath1 teaches us that putting lots of eggs into one strong basket is an avenue to success , then it ought to be the case that putting even more and bigger eggs into _",
    "strong baskets ought to be even better .",
    "the mathematical justification is evident : renormalization of a phonon depends on @xmath21 for the specific @xmath89 point , while @xmath13 is a sum over all @xmath89 .",
    "whereas increasing coupling strength in a given region @xmath22 reaches its limit ( structural instability ) in the way that was modeled in sec .",
    "ii , putting additional strength in other ( non - overlapping ) regions of the zone @xmath90 adds coupling strength while renormalizing _ other _ phonons , thus increasing @xmath13 while not threatening the overall stability of the lattice .",
    "the way one goes about this is illustrated by the fermi surface in fig .",
    "one designs an mgb@xmath1-like material ( _ i.e. _ quasi-2d with a stiff reference system ) that has _",
    "several _ cylindrical fermi surfaces ; in the example shown the new feature is the six ( symmetry - related ) fermi surfaces along the @xmath65-k lines in a hexagonal lattice . the nesting vectors @xmath91 ( those shown , and symmetry partners )",
    "form the centers of circles ( cylinders , when shown in 3d ) of radius @xmath92 .",
    "these kohn - anomaly - enclosed regions have radius @xmath28 , hence diameter of @xmath93 , and could comprise most of the brillouin zone , so nearly all of the phonons are renormalized ( and strongly coupled if the bare coupling is large ) .",
    "then , if one is a clever enough materials designer , one manages to provide a large bare coupling [ n(e@xmath12)@xmath15 ] to every branch of the phonon spectrum rather than just two of nine as in mgb@xmath1 .    if one then manages to get all phonons as strongly coupled as in mgb@xmath1 ( instead of only @xmath233% ) , then one achieves @xmath41 25 or so , with the lattice remaining stable . for mgb@xmath1 ,",
    "the projected value of t@xmath0 ( allen - dynes equation,@xcite @xmath94 = 60 mev , @xmath2 = 0.15 ) is of the order of 400 - 500 k. this estimate is in accord with the stated strong coupling limit 0.15@xmath95 provided by allen and dynes,@xcite which for these constants gives t@xmath0 = 525 k.    this analysis actually neglects the primary aspects of mgb@xmath1-like systems , that 2d phase space is such that the total coupling from a circular fermi surface is independent of its size , _ i.e. _ the doping level , and that the phonon renormalization ( and impending structural instability ) also do not depend on the doping level . hence it is not strictly the fraction of the brillouin zone that one can marshal that is important .",
    "rather , it is the number of fermi surfaces one can create  the `` band degeneracy '' factor @xmath35 in eq .",
    "[ lambda ] .",
    "whether they are hole - like or electron - like is not important , only that they are there and are quasi-2d .",
    "more , smaller sheets are better , up to a point ; if they get too small ( e@xmath12 very near a band edge ) non - adiabatic effects arise , and getting into the very low carrier regime will introduce a poorly screened coulomb interaction between carriers that will invalidate the present considerations .    perhaps the most important feature that mgb@xmath1 has introduced is a platform for distributing couplinng strength relatively uniformly , something that decades ago was presumed to be the norm but may be instead the exception .",
    "the seemingly innocuous 3d system of fcc li achieves a remarkable increase in t@xmath0 under pressure , but it arises from ( broadened ) ` surface regions ' in specific locations in the zone .",
    "the correspoinding phonons provide strong coulping but rapidly become unstable , in line the classical understanding discussed in the introduction .",
    "building on `` mgb@xmath1-like '' principles might yet lead to important enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature .",
