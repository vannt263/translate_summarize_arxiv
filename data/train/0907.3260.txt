    "stars are born in molecular clouds which are magnetized interstellar clouds in our galaxy .",
    "recent observations with high - angular - resolution measurements of polarized dust emission have shown that the star formation and gas collapsing processes are certainly closely related to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the existence of highly collimated outflow / jets has established an indispensable role played by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the realistic process of star formation in a magnetized molecular cloud is fully three - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamics ( hereafter mhd ) with self - gravity .",
    "theoretical astrophysicists are now tackling this process by the method of numerical simulation thanks to the recent development of various techniques @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations of protostellar collapse without magnetic field have shown that initially rotating molecular clouds tend to form binary or higher multiple stars @xcite , and the resultant binary stars are externally surrounded by circum - binary disks , which have already been observed in star - forming regions . on the other hand ,",
    "protostellar collapse calculations with magnetic field of the observationally inferred strength show spectacular bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "the outflow is driven by the lorentz force and removes the angular momentum of the driving object , which suppresses the fragmentation or the binary formation @xcite .",
    "thus , the driving of mhd outflow and the binary formation have been thought to be incompatible so far , although both the protostellar outflows and circumbinary disks have been observed numerously in star forming regions .",
    "therefore , understanding of the puzzling link between them seems to require qualitative improvement in theoretical modeling .",
    "a clue for possible modifications are found in the evolution of magnetic field : most of the previous mhd calculations for the evolution of the collapsing cloud were done under the ideal mhd approximation that is valid only in the low - density phase of molecular gas but not in the high - density protostellar phase , which is obviously the room for the improvement for theoreticians .",
    "recently we studied the star formation process in resistive mhd calculations that account for the low ionization degree in molecular clouds , and showed the magnetic field is significantly removed from the centre of the collapsing cloud and fragmentation ( or binary formation ) is actually possible even in a strongly magnetized cloud @xcite . in this paper , we show the dramatic relation between the binary formation and outflow in resistive mhd calculations .",
    "to study the evolution of star - forming cores in a large dynamic range of spatial scale , a three - dimensional nested grid method is used , in which the equations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics are solved ( see eq .",

    "the critical be radius is @xmath3au . to promote the contraction",
    ", we increase the density by 1.68 times .",
    "the mass inside @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the cloud rotates rigidly with @xmath6s@xmath7 around the @xmath8-axis in the region of @xmath9 , while the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath10@xmath11 g ) parallel to the @xmath8-axis ( or rotation axis ) is adopted in the whole computational domain . in the region of @xmath12 ,",
    "the ratio of thermal @xmath13 , rotational @xmath14 , and magnetic @xmath15 to gravitational energies are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively .    for a realistic evolution of the magnetic field in the collapsing gas cloud",

    "the calculation is first performed with five grid levels ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "thus , grid of @xmath23 has a box size of @xmath25au .",
    "a new finer grid is generated before the jeans condition is violated .",
    "the maximum level of grids is @xmath26 that has a box size of 35au and the cell width of 0.54au .",
    "we calculate two models : ( a ) resistive and ( b ) ideal mhd models .",
    "hereafter , we call the former ` resistive model ' , and the latter ` ideal model . '",
    "both models have the same initial condition shown above .",
    "the former include resistive term in induction equation , while the latter does not .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:1]_a _ ( the dotted line ) , the molecular gas obeys the isothermal equation of state with temperature of @xmath27 k until @xmath28 , then cloud collapses almost adiabatically ( @xmath29 ; adiabatic phase ) and quasi - static core ( hereafter , first core ) forms during the adiabatic phase @xcite .",
    "the first core forms both in resistive and ideal mhd models when the central density reaches @xmath30 , and have a radius of @xmath27 au and mass of @xmath31 . by coincidence",
    ", the first core formation epoch almost agrees with the epoch at which the ohmic dissipation becomes effective ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , as seen in figure  [ fig:1]_a_. therefore , in resistive model , the magnetic field dissipates inside or around the first core with time after its formation .",
    "the evolutions of the magnetic field @xmath33 and angular momentum @xmath34 after the first core formation @xmath35 both in ideal and resistive models are plotted in figure  [ fig:1]_b_. the figure shows that @xmath36 and @xmath34 have the same evolution track in both models for @xmath37yr but different tracks for @xmath38yr . in ideal model",
    ", the magnetic field continues to increase to reach @xmath39 g at @xmath40yr , while the angular momentum decreases to have @xmath41 at the same epoch .",
    "the decrease of the angular momentum is due to the magnetic braking which transfers the angular momentum outwardly along the magnetic field lines @xcite . since the cloud collapse slows and the rotation timescale becomes shorter than the collapsing timescale after the first core formation , magnetic field lines are strongly twisted and the angular momentum is considerably transferred owing of the amplified field . on the other hand , in resistive model ,",
    "the magnetic field begins to decrease at @xmath42yr , while the angular momentum continues to increase .",
    "since the density of the first core exceeds @xmath43 , the magnetic field is effectively removed from the first core by the ohmic dissipation as shown in figure  [ fig:1]_a_. thus , the region around and inside the first core has a weak field that little contribute to the magnetic braking , thus , the first core in resistive model has a larger angular momentum than that in ideal model . as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , the magnetic field in resistive model is about two orders of magnitude weaker than that in ideal model , while the angular momentum in resistive model is about two orders of magnitude larger that that in ideal model .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of density and magnetic field on @xmath44 and @xmath45 planes after the first core formation .",
    "the first core has a disk - like structure ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2]_k_-_n _ ) with a centrally peak density profile ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2]_a_-_d _ ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field has a peak at edge or outside of the first core : the peak of the magnetic field has a ring - like structure as shown in figures  [ fig:2]_g_-_i_. this is because the magnetic flux is removed from the region inside the first core by the ohmic dissipation",
    ". figures  [ fig:2]_b_-_d _ indicate that the first core has a density of @xmath46 where the magnetic reynolds number is below unity @xmath32 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_a _ ) , thus the magnetic field dissipates effectively .",
    "since the first core increases in size with times , the decoupled region ( i.e. , the region with @xmath32 ) also expands .",
    "therefore , the peak of the magnetic field strength moves outwardly as shown in figures  [ fig:2]_g_-_i_. in resistive model , since the magnetic braking is not so effective owing to the weak field , the first core continues to spin up ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig:1]_b _ ) . in general",
    ", when the first core has a large angular momentum , fragmentation occurs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fragmentation occurs @xmath47yr after the first core formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]_e _ ) only in resistive model .",
    "both in ideal and resistive models , the outflow appears @xmath48yr after the first core formation .",
    "this kind of outflow was already reported in many past studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figures  [ fig:2]_k_-_o _ ,",
    "the outflowing region is represented by the white - dotted line inside which the gas is outflowing from the center of the cloud .",
    "outflow continues to driven near the first core in ideal model . on the other hand , in resistive model , the driving point of the outflow moves outwardly with time",
    "as seen in figures  [ fig:2]_k_-_o _ , because the decoupled region of @xmath32 expands outwardly . in resistive model ,",
    "the magnetic field is too weak to drive outflow in the region near the first core where the magnetic dissipation is effective .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] left panel shows the configuration of the outflow for resistive model , which indicates that the outflow driven by the circumbinary disk , not by the protostar ( or proto - binary ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] upper right panel shows the configuration of magnetic field lines that are strongly twisted by the rotation of the circumbinary disk .",
    "the circumbinary disk has a density of @xmath49 and is well coupled with the magnetic field that can drive the outflow . on the other hand , the magnetic field is too weak to drive outflow in the region around protobinary .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows @xmath50 on the @xmath44 plane with the same scale of left panel , and indicates that the magnetic field is weak around protobinary but strong in the circumbinary disk .",
    "in this study , we show that the outflow can be driven by the circumbinary disk .",
    "we calculated the evolution of outflow 1762yr after its emergence , in which outflow continues to be driven by the circumbinary disk and reach 427au from the center of the cloud with a maximum speed of @xmath51 . at the end of the calculation , each fragment ( i.e. , each protobinary ) has an only mass of @xmath52 . during calculation",
    ", the protobinary revolves about the center of the cloud ( i.e. , common center of gravity ) @xmath53 times , keeping a separation of about @xmath54au .",
    "it is expected that the mass of the protobinary , and size and speed of outflow increase with time in the gas accretion phase .",
    "previous studies about the evolution of a rotating cloud showed that fragmentation frequently occurs only after the gas becomes optically thick ( i.e. , after the first core formation ) and binary system is possible to form when the molecular cloud has a certain amount of the angular momentum @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the study about a collapsing magnetized - rotating cloud showed that the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation and a single star tends to form in a strongly magnetized core , because the rotation ( or angular momentum ) to promote fragmentation is transferred by the magnetic effect such as the magnetic braking and outflow @xcite .",
    "however , these studies adopted ideal mhd approximation . in reality , the magnetic field dissipates in the high - density region in the collapsing cloud @xcite . note that although the ambipolar diffusion and the hall term effect can be also important for the magnetic dissipation , the ohmic dissipation dominates in the high - density gas region @xcite .",
    "we calculated the magnetized rotating cloud including the magnetic dissipation , and found the following : ( 1 ) fragmentation occurs to form the protobinary by the rapid rotation , since a weak magnetic field realized by the ohmic dissipation makes the angular momentum transfer by the magnetic effect ineffective .",
    "in addition , such weak field can not drive outflow from the protobinary , ( 2 ) strong outflow is driven by the circumbinary disk , because the magnetic field accumulates in the circumbinary disk where the removal and accretion of magnetic field are balanced , then the strong field is realized .",
    "the binary system often shows a single outflow that may be driven by the circumbinary disk , not by one protostar in binary system .",
    "for example , a single molecular outflow in l1551 irs5 , in which binary system is embedded , may be driven by this mechanism .    in the present study",
    ", we adopted the resistivity @xmath19 as most plausible value as shown in figure  [ fig:1]_a_. however , the resistivity depends on the size distribution and abundance of dusts . the resistivity is closely related to the magnetic dissipation .",
    "the magnetic field is related to most fundamental phenomena of the star formation : the angular momentum and magnetic flux problem , fragmentation and binary formation , and outflow driving .",
    "thus , it is crucial to determine the resistivity for resolving major problems in star formation .",
    "since the strength and driving point of the outflow is directly related to the resistivity as shown in this paper , we can determine it with future higher - resolution observations such as alma .",
