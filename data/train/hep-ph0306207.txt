    "in the past decade continuous progress has been made in the investigation of excited heavy baryons .",
    "the lowest lying orbitally excited charmed states @xmath5 and @xmath6 have been observed by several collaborations@xcite , the excited states of @xmath7 have also been reported recently@xcite , and more data are expected in the near future . from the theoretical prospect of view",
    "those data need to be studied comprehensively .",
    "furthermore , with the collection of more experimental data for exited heavy baryon states it is useful to make some theoretical predictions on their spectroscopies .",
    "heavy baryons containing a single heavy quark can be described exactly by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this fact should be contributed to the spin - flavor symmetry of system comprised of infinitely heavy quarks .",
    "hqet has been applied successfully to learn about the properties of heavy mesons and baryons , including the spectroscopy and weak decays .",
    "the mass formula for a spin symmetry doublet of heavy baryons up to order @xmath8 corrections can be written as @xmath9 where parameter @xmath10 is the effective mass of the light degrees of freedom in the @xmath11 limit , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are related to the heavy quark kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic energy of hqet , respectively @xmath12 the constant @xmath13 characterizes the spin - orbit interaction of the heavy quark and the gluon field , it is zero for singlet and @xmath14 , @xmath15 for spin 1/2 , spin 3/2 doublet , respectively .",
    "thus the splitting of the spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 doublets is @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 denote spin 1/2 and 3/2 doublet , respectively .    the heavy baryon mass parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 play a most significant role in our understanding of the spectroscopy @xcite and inclusive decay rates @xcite .",
    "they must be estimated in some nonperturbative approaches due to the asymptotic freedom property of qcd .",
    "a viable approach is the qcd sum rules @xcite formulated in the framework of hqet @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to relate hadronic observable to qcd parameters _ via _ the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the correlator . in the case of ground state",
    "heavy baryon , predictions on the mass spectroscopy have been made to leading and next - to - leading order in @xmath19 @xcite and to order @xmath8 @xcite using qcd sum rule method .",
    "as to the excited baryon mass spectroscopy , only results to leading order in @xmath8 expansion have been obtained from qcd sum rule @xcite . in @xcite we have calculated the baryonic parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the ground state @xmath20 and @xmath21 baryons using qcd sum rules in the hqet .",
    "employing the baryonic currents from @xcite we now derive these parameters for excited @xmath22- and @xmath23-type baryons following the same procedure .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ssec1 ] we introduce the interpolating currents for excited state heavy baryons and briefly present the two - point sum rules .",

    "@xmath27 can be chosen co - variantly as @xmath28 for @xmath29 doublets spin 1/2 baryon , and @xmath30 for @xmath29 doublets spin 3/2 baryon , in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are perpendicular to heavy quark velocity @xmath33 , defined as @xmath34 .",
    "for the singlets @xmath35 and @xmath36 the @xmath37 is simply unit matrix @xmath38 .",
    "notations used here to describe excited state heavy baryons are the same as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite : k denotes @xmath39 and @xmath40 whereas k denotes @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 is the orbital angular momentum describes the relative motion of the two light quarks and the orbital angular momentum @xmath44 describes orbital motion of the center of mass of the two light quarks relative to the heavy quark .",
    "q denotes heavy quark and the number in subscript is the total angular momentum of the light diquark system . as that for ground state baryons ,",
    "the flavor configuration of @xmath22 type baryon is antisymmetric and @xmath23 type is symmetric .",
    "depending on the number of derivatives or the form of @xmath27 , interpolating currents can have forms different from those listed above and may also be used in applications@xcite .    in the following analysis",
    "we would use those currents to interpolate excited heavy baryon states . at the leading order of the @xmath8 expansion they do not mix with each other even with the same quantum number , but to the next - to - leading order the mixing of interpolating currents will appear . in our subsequent calculations",
    "we would only use those currents and did not consider the effect resulting from the mixing of interpolating currents for references @xcite have shown that the stability criterion for qcd sum rule applications excludes the existence of interpolating currents mixing or though there does exist the mixing the numerical result will not change drastically compared with the case without mixing .",

    "irrespective of an irrelevant constant factor in the leading order , the coupling constants for spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 doublet are equivalent for their identical spin - parity of the light degrees of freedom .    in order to determine the effective mass of the excited baryons , we analyze the two - point correlator defined as @xmath49\\pi ( \\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the residual momentum and @xmath51 . for large negative value of @xmath52 @xmath53",

    ", the relevant diagrams in our theoretical calculations for the kinetic energy are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the relevant diagrams for the chromo - magnetic interaction do not differ from those for the ground state baryons @xcite ,",
    "so we do not show them here . using dispersion relations @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 can be casted into the form of integrals of the double spectral densities . following refs .",
    "@xcite , introduce new variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , perform the integral over @xmath67 , assume quark ",
    "hadron duality in @xmath68 , and employ borel transformation @xmath69 , @xmath70 to suppress the continuum contributions and subtractions , we then obtained the desired sum rules . considered the symmetry of the correlator it is natural to set the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath71 to be the same and equal to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the borel parameter of the two - point functions .",
    "we ended up with the set of sum rules    @xmath74    the unitary normalization of flavor matrix @xmath75=1 $ ] has been applied to get those sum rules , as what has been done for the two - point sum rules .",
    "in the following analysis , the standard value for the condensates are adopted @xcite . from two - point sum",
    "rules the effective mass can be obtained via a derivative of the borel parameter as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the right hand side of the obtained two - point sum rule .",
    "then comply to the standard procedure of sum rule analysis , we changed the continuum threshold @xmath78 and borel parameter @xmath73 to find the optimal stability window and the numerical value of the effective mass will be determined within this window . for those sum rules obtained above , we found the typical value for the continuum threshold is @xmath79 and typical interval for the borel parameter is @xmath80 , which is a narrower one than the window for the ground state baryon .",
    "the only exception of this assertion is @xmath35 , for which we found a much lower continuum threshold @xmath81 and a narrower interval @xmath82 .",
    "also it is worth noting that for @xmath35 , the main contribution does not come from the perturbative part .",
    "the condensate ones play an important role in the determination of stability window . indeed ,",
    "if one keeps only gluon condensate contribution , there will be no stability window at all , just like the case in ref.@xcite .",
    "but if assuming the perturbative dominance and omitting condensate contributions , we only ended up with a better stability and the numerical value is almost exactly the same . for the other sum rules for the effective mass the case is different",
    "the dominant contribution to those sum rules comes from the perturbative part , and the dimension 4 and dimension 6 operators in the ope only amount to 20% and 10% within the stability windows , respectively .",
    "the numerical results are presented in fig .",
    "3 . for the aim of clarity",
    "we give our numerical average for the effective masses in table [ tab1 ] .    in order to get the numerical results for two",
    "@xmath8 order parameters , we divide our three - point sum rules by two - point functions to obtain @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of the continuum threshold @xmath78 and the borel parameter @xmath73 .",
    "this procedure can eliminate the systematic uncertainties and cancel the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "from the experiences of qcd sum rule applications in the field of heavy quark physics it is well known that three - point sum rule receives heavier contamination from the continuum modes than two - point one , and the stability is not as good as that for two - point sum rule@xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath1 sum rules of those excited heavy baryons are shown in fig . 3 and in fig .",
    "4 results for @xmath2 sum rules are presented .",
    "the typical value of continuum threshold is @xmath83 , @xmath84 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 sum rules , respectively .",
    "and the typical interval of the stability window is also @xmath85 for both .",
    "the @xmath1 sum rule for the @xmath36 baryon is an exception of above statement , for which the typical value of continuum threshold is @xmath86 and the interval is @xmath87 . as for the convergence of the ope within the stability windows for those sum rules we would like to state some facts . for the @xmath1 sum rules , except the case of @xmath88 , in which the dimension 4 and 6 operators give rise to contributions almost equal to that of the perturbative part , all other sum rules behave well , in which the contributions of the dimension 4 and 6 operators amount to 50% and 20% of that of the perturbative part . on the other hand , for the @xmath2 sum rules , the dimension 4 operator still contributes to almost 50% compared to that of the perturbative part , but the dimension 6 operator gives only a negligible contribution , typically less than 10% .",
