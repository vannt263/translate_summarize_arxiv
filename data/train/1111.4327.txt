    "let us briefly discuss the quantum phase transitions in the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] .",

    "finally , we can discuss the multicritical point where the collinear lro , non - collinear lro , and dimer phases meet . here",
    ", the softness of the triplon dispersion in one direction , eq .  , implies that the quadratic piece of the critical field theory takes the form @xmath224 where @xmath225 are the components of the magnetic order parameter , and @xmath226 defines the phase transition point .",
    "such @xmath227 quantum lifshitz points ( here @xmath228 , and @xmath229 refers to the number of `` soft '' directions ) have been discussed before,@xcite but the relevant case of @xmath228 dimensions with undamped order - parameter dynamics has not been studied in any detail . a thorough analysis of this critical theory is therefore deferred to a future publication ; here we only make a few qualitative remarks .",
    "the absence of the quadratic derivative in @xmath96 direction implies that the effective dimensionality is reduced compared to a standard @xmath230 theory , or in other words , the upper critical dimension ( in the quantum case ) is increased from @xmath231 to @xmath232 ( ref .  ) .",
    "while eq .  , supplemented by a standard quartic term (",
    "note that a cubic term@xcite might be important as well ) , describes a continuous multicritical point , it is conceivable that this is pre - empted by a fluctuation - induced transition into a novel phase .",
    "we speculate that this could be a non - trivial paramagnetic phase ( e.g. with a symmetry - breaking dimerization ) , as deduced for @xmath25 from series - expansion studies.@xcite      as mentioned in the introduction , the experimental findings@xcite indicate that the organic mott insulator etme@xmath0p[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2  realizes a columnar vbs phase at low temperature and pressure . according to ref .",
    ", this system can be described by the heisenberg model with @xmath16 and @xmath38 .",
    "although this configuration is outside of the vbs region predicted by our bond - operator analysis , it is quite close to the vbs phase boundary ( see the orange diamond , fig .  [",
    "fig : phase - diag ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that a combination of longer - range or ring - exchange interactions , which arise in the proximity to the mott transition,@xcite increase the level of magnetic frustration , which is then released by a lattice dimerization through magnetoelastic couplings ( note that organic compounds of the x[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2  display a rather soft lattice ) . as a result ,",
    "a vbs phase can emerge , whose magnetic couplings are explicitly dimerized as in our hamiltonian .",
    "therefore we believe that the excitation spectrum of the organic compound may display features qualitatively similar to the ones shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ]  b , which corresponds to a configuration ( @xmath111 , @xmath15 ) close to the critical line .",
    "hence we predict the spin correlations in the vbs phase of etme@xmath0p[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2  to be incommensurate , which may be checked in future neutron scattering or nmr experiments .",
    "moreover it would be interesting to see whether one could drive the material into a state with magnetic lro , by moving farther away from the mott transition ( and thus reducing the influence of magnetic couplings beyond nearest - neighbor exchange ) .",
    "we have studied a dimerized heisenberg af on a spatially anisotropic triangular lattice , with focus on its quantum paramagnetic ( i.e. dimer ) phase . starting from bond - operator mean - field theory , we have included interaction corrections to the harmonic approximation at the hartree - fock level for the quartic term and in second - order perturbation theory for the cubic term .",
    "we have shown that this hartree - fock - cubic approximation gives sensible results for the triplon dispersion for the investigated part of the parameter space ( away from the one - dimensional limit ) .",
    "the resulting boundary of the dimer phase where the triplon gap closes , fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diag ] , is one of our main results ; its location in the unfrustrated limit @xmath24 is in good quantitative agreement with qmc data .",
    "the minimum wavevector @xmath97 of the triplon spectrum displays a commensurate - incommensurate transition as frustration is increased . at this cit",
    "the quadratic piece of the triplon dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction .",
    "the closing of the triplon gap at the cit leads to a quantum lifshitz point , the detailed study of which is left for future work : it either leads to distinct power - law critical behavior or it may even be inherently unstable , leading to a novel intermediate phase , fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] .",
    "remarkably , we find the critical @xmath12 to be only slightly above unity , suggesting that the origin of the non - trivial vbs phase seen in series - expansion studies@xcite for the non - dimerized model is indeed the enhanced fluctuations near the quantum lifshitz point .",
    "finally , in the incommensurate regime of the dimer phase the cubic triplon interaction leads to two - particle decay of triplons at high energies .",
    "our study paves the way to further investigations of frustrated dimerized magnets . as those are difficult to access using qmc simulations , due to the inherent minus sign problem , bond - operator as well as series - expansion techniques are often the methods of choice .",
