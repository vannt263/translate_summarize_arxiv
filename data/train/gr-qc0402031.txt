    "the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) observations support that the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down @xcite .",
    "a spatially flat universe is favored by the measurements of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the observation of type ia supernova sn 1997ff at @xmath1 also provides the evidence that the universe is in the acceleration phase and was in the deceleration phase in recent past @xcite .",
    "the transition from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase happens around the redshift @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the simplest way of explaining the acceleration phenomenon is through the cosmological constant with the equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",

    "the energy density of the quintessence field must remain very small compared with radiation and matter at early epoches and evolves in a way that it started to dominate the universe around the redshift @xmath7 .",
    "if we remove the null energy condition restriction @xmath8 to allow supernegative @xmath9 , then the phantom energy models arise @xcite .",

    "there are fields other than the quintessence field , such as tachyon field , as dark energy @xcite .",
    "although there are many dark energy models proposed in the literature , the nature of dark energy is still unknown .",
    "therefore it is also possible that the observations show a sign of the breakdown of the standard cosmology . in brane",
