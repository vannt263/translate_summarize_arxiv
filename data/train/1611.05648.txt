    "in this paper , we propose to revisit the method of relativistic sum rules to extract the charm quark mass with emphasis on the evaluation of the uncertainty .    among the most precise charm mass determinations , including lattice simulations  @xcite and deep - inelastic scattering data  @xcite , relativistic qcd sum rules play an important role on establishing the quark mass at the few - percent level  @xcite .",
