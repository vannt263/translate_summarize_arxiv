    "since strong and broad emission lines are a hallmark of quasar optical  uv spectra , the discovery of @xmath0 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) quasars at with extremely weak or undetectable emission lines ( hereafter wlqs ) is puzzling ( see fan et al .  1999 for the discovery of the prototype high - redshift wlq , sdss  j153259.96@xmath1003944.1 , at @xmath2 ) . while the rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of the ly@xmath3 emission lines of typical sdss quasars at @xmath4 follow a distribution and 68% of ews are in the range @xmath5    ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ; et al .",
    "2009 ) , wlqs exhibit ew(ly@xmath3)@xmath6   , constituting a @xmath7 deviation from the mean of the distribution ( there is no detectable corresponding deviation at the high ew end ; et al .",
    "2009 ) . by virtue of their largely featureless spectra",
    ", the redshifts of these wlqs can be determined only from the onset of the ly@xmath8 forest or the lyman limit ( i.e. , @xmath9 for sdss sources ; e.g. , fan et al .",
    "1999 ; anderson et al .",
    "2001 ; collinge et al .  2005 ; schneider et al .  2005 ) .    since wlqs exhibit typical quasar uv continua with no signs of broad absorption , they are unlikely to be dust - obscured or broad - absorption line quasars ( see , e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "2001 ; collinge et al .",
    "in addition , shemmer et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter s06 ) have argued against the possibility that these sources are high - redshift galaxies with apparent quasar - like luminosities due to gravitational - lensing amplification , or lensed quasars with continua amplified by microlensing .",
    "s06 suggested that the two most likely interpretations for the weakness of the high - ionization emission lines in these sources are either line dilution due to a relativistically boosted continuum or , alternatively , physical suppression of the high - ionization emission lines .",
    "the first interpretation for the nature of wlqs involves relativistic beaming of the continuum emission from a jet directed close to our line of sight , as observed in bl  lacertae objects ( bl  lacs ) .",
    "this scenario implies that the sdss may have discovered the long - sought , high - redshift bl  lacs ( e.g. , stocke 2001 ) ; the absence of such sources is even more puzzling since their beamed continua should have made them easier to detect at high redshift than ordinary quasars .",
    "however , this interpretation faces serious difficulties .",
    "for example , s06 have found that the basic , optical , and radio properties of five wlqs are consistent only with the - and radio - weak tail of the bl  lac population .",
    "moreover , while both wlqs and bl  lacs share the property of a lineless uv spectrum , bl  lacs also often exhibit high optical polarization levels , rapid and large - amplitude flux variations , and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) dominated by beamed , non - thermal emission at all wavelengths ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) . such extreme properties have , so far , not been observed in a subsample of sdss wlqs ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "1999 ; diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the alternative interpretation is that wlqs may be quasars with abnormal photoionizing continuum or broad emission - line region ( belr ) properties . in this scenario ,",
    "the weak high - ionization emission lines of wlqs may , for example , ultimately be a consequence of exceptionally high accretion rates in these sources .",
    "a higher accretion rate is expected to result in a softer , uv - peaked continuum that suppresses the high - ionization emission lines , while low - ionization species such as the balmer and lines are not significantly affected ( e.g. , leighly et al .  2007a , b ) .",
    "accretion rates in wlqs have not yet been determined in order to test this possibility ( for example , by measuring the width of h@xmath10 in such sources ; see , e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the key to understanding wlqs , therefore , lies in comparing their multiwavelength spectral , as well as polarimetric and temporal , properties with those of bl  lacs and typical quasars .",
    "while the sdss wlqs are rare , their exceptional properties constitute a challenge to our overall understanding of agn physics and thus might lead to new insights about the accretion process , emission - line formation , and relativistic jets . in this paper",
    ", we measure basic  properties for the first respectably sized sample of wlqs in order to shed light on their nature and to assist in planning more detailed spectroscopy of these sources in the future . since probe the innermost regions of agns ,",
    "our observations are intended to study the basic diagnostics of the central accretion process in wlqs .",
    "this paper nearly triples the number of @xmath9 wlqs that have sensitive  coverage , increasing the number of  detections by almost a factor of five .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ observations ] we describe the wlq sample selection , as well as our  observations and their reduction ; our basic findings are presented in   [ results ] . in   [ discussion ]",

    "further testing the association of wlqs with radio - weak bl  lacs requires broader spectroscopic coverage of both classes .",

    "the second scenario attempting to explain the missing uv lines in wlqs suggests that these sources are quasars hosting abnormal belrs or quasars with extreme properties (  [ introduction ] ) . in this case",
    ", one does not expect to find many radio - bright ( i.e. , radio - loud ) wlqs , since the majority of quasars at all luminosities and redshifts are known to be radio quiet ( e.g. , jiang et al .",

    "2001 ) as well as with the slopes of a larger sample of high - redshift wlqs ( diamond - stanic et al .",
    "this apparently steeper slope ( compared with observed for low - redshift quasars ) is essentially due to the restricted wavelength range over which this slope can be measured in the optical spectra of high - redshift sources ( i.e. , given a sufficiently broad wavelength range , the uv continuum slope is , and it does not evolve with redshift ; see , e.g. , schneider et al .  2005 ) .",
    "bl  lacs , on the other hand , are considerably redder in this band ( with ; e.g. , collinge et al .",
    "the lack of red uv spectra in wlqs may also be reflected by the upper limit we place on the mean column density of neutral absorption in these sources (  [ sec_joint_fit ] ; table  [ joint_fit_par ] ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the idea that the weakness of the emission lines is not a consequence of dust absorption , even though the upper limit on @xmath67  does not provide a tight constraint on allowed reddening in the rest - frame uv .",
    "another indication that wlqs are related to typical quasars lies in their @xmath74  distribution ( with a spread of @xmath129 for the radio - quiet sources ; see fig .",

    "these three sources , which also appear different from bl  lacs , may perhaps be the low - redshift analogs of the @xmath123 wlqs ; they are plotted separately in figure  [ a_ro_a_ox ] . the fact that all our wlqs lie at high redshifts is clearly a selection effect due to the requirement of a lyman break detection .",

    "testing this idea and the hypothesis that emission - line ew is correlated primarily with @xmath137  across the entire agn luminosity range requires extending the baskin & laor ( 2004 ) analysis to much higher luminosities , such as those of our wlqs ; this is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "<S> we present _ chandra _  observations of nine high - redshift quasars discovered by the sloan digital sky survey with weak or undetectable high - ionization emission lines in their uv spectra ( wlqs ) . </S>",
    "<S> adding archival  observations of six additional sources of this class has enabled us to place the strongest constraints yet on the  properties of this remarkable class of agns . </S>",
    "<S> although our data can not rule out the possibility that the emission lines are overwhelmed by a relativistically boosted continuum , as manifested by bl  lac objects , we find that wlqs are considerably weaker in the  and radio bands than the majority of bl  lacs found at much lower redshifts . if wlqs are high - redshift bl  lacs , then it is difficult to explain the lack of a large parent population of  and radio bright weak - lined sources at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the possibility that wlqs are quasars with extreme properties , and in particular that the emission lines are suppressed by high accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> using joint spectral fitting of the  spectra of 11 wlqs we find that the mean photon index in the hard  band is consistent with those observed in typical radio - quiet agns with no hint of an unusually steep hard-  spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this result poses a challenge to the hypothesis that wlqs have extremely high accretion rates , and we discuss additional observations required to test this idea . </S>"
