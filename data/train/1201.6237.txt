    "it is generally accepted today that the fermi surfaces of metallic systems obtained with density functional theory ( dft ) , even at the level of local density approximation ( lda ) , are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case with the band gaps of insulators and semiconductors which are highly underestimated by most of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals within dft .",
    "even with the exact xc functional of dft , the kohn - sham ( ks ) gap is not expected to reproduce the experimental gap@xcite .",
    "this deviation from experiment is most dramatic for mott - insulators , most of which are predicted by their ks spectrum to be metallic while they are experimentally known to be insulating in nature .    in this regard reduced density matrix functional theory ( rdmft ) has shown great promise in improving on dft results for a wide class of systems in that it not only improves the ks - band gaps for insulators in general , but also predicts the correct insulating nature for mott insulators @xcite . within rdmft",
    "the total energy of a system of interacting electrons is expressed in terms of the one - body reduced density matrix ( 1-rdm ) , @xmath0 .",
    "this energy functional is then minimized with respect to @xmath1 under the @xmath2-representability conditions  @xcite which restrict the minimization to the domain of 1-rdms that correspond to ensembles of @xmath2-electron wave functions .",
    "a major advantage of rdmft comes from the fact that the _ exact _ kinetic energy is easily expressed as a functional of the 1-rdm of the ground state .",
    "in addition , due to the departure from the idempotent single - determinant solution , static electronic correlations are well described@xcite .",
    "the total ground - state energy as a functional of @xmath1 reads ( atomic units are used throughout ) : @xmath3=&-\\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\lim_{{\\bf r}\\rightarrow{\\bf r } ' } \\nabla_{\\bf r}^2 \\gamma({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')\\,d^3{\\bf r } ' + \\int\\rho({\\bf r})\\ , v_{\\rm ext}({\\bf r})\\,d^3{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2 }   \\int   \\frac{\\rho({\\bf r})\\,\\rho({\\bf r } ' ) } { |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|}\\,d^3{\\bf r}\\,d^3{\\bf r}'+e_{\\rm xc}[\\gamma],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is a given external potential , and @xmath6 we call the xc energy functional . in practice ,",
    "the xc functional is an unknown functional of the 1-rdm and needs to be approximated .",
    "a milestone in the development of approximate functionals of the 1-rdm is the mller functional@xcite , which has the following form : @xmath7=e_{\\rm xc}[\\{\\phi_{j}\\},\\{n_{j}\\ } ] = \\\\",
    "-\\frac{1}{2}\\int   \\int   \\frac{|\\gamma^{1/2}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')|^2}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| } \\ , d^3{\\bf r}\\ , d^3{\\bf r}'\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is an exponent in the operator sense .",
    "diagonalization of @xmath1 produces a set of natural orbitals ( the eigenvectors of @xmath1 ) , @xmath9 , and occupation numbers ( the eigenvalues of @xmath1 ) , @xmath10 .",
    "the mller functional is known to over correlate@xcite , however , there exist several other approximations most of which are modifications of this functional and are known to improve results for finite systems @xcite .",
    "several of these rdmft functionals reproduce the discontinuity of the chemical potential at integer number of electrons which is a measure of the fundamental gap of the system@xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was demonstrated @xcite that the complete removal of the self - interaction ( si ) terms leads to discontinuities in the chemical potential that are in good agreement with the fundamental gap for finite systems .",
    "unfortunately , this removal has no effect in the total energy for infinitely extended natural orbitals in periodic systems since their contribution vanishes in the limit of the size of system going to infinity . to overcome this problem , sharma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the power functional@xcite that reproduces discontinuities without requiring the removal of si terms .",
    "this functional has the form @xmath11=e_{\\rm xc}[\\{\\phi_{j}\\},\\{n_{j}\\ } ] = \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\ , \\int    \\frac{|\\gamma^{\\alpha}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}')|^2}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|}\\,d^3{\\bf r}\\ , d^3{\\bf r}'\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is an exponent in the operator sense .",
    "the power functional was applied in the calculation of the fundamental gap of various systems@xcite including transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "an optimal value of @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 was found to reproduce gaps of all systems in close agreement with experiments .",
    "these gaps were obtained from the discontinuity of the chemical potential , @xmath15 , at an integer total number of electrons @xmath2 .",
    "a problem of this method of predicting the gap is that the shape of @xmath15 differs substantially from a step function leading to large error - bars in the prediction of the gap .",
    "a second problem is that one needs to calculate the total energy ( and @xmath16 ) for several values of @xmath2 making the calculation time consuming .",
    "finally , a third problem is that this method does not allow for the calculation of quantities other than the gap , for direct comparison with experiments , like for example the density of states for extended systems and ionization potentials ( ips ) and electron affinities ( eas ) for finite systems .",
    "an advantage of dft is that the ks eigenvalues can be used as an approximate single - electron spectrum of the system .",
    "thus , quantities like the ip and ea can be easily estimated using the ks spectrum .",
    "a fundamental difference between rdmft and dft is the lack of a ks system within rdmft and the lack of eigenvalue equation makes it difficult to obtain ( even approximately ) the ips and the eas .",
    "one way to calculate ips in rdmft , is to use extended koopman s theorem ( ekt ) , as was proposed by pernal and cioslowski@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the lagrangian matrix in rdmft is identical with the generalized fock matrix entering ekt .",
    "thus , ips can be calculated by diagonalization of this matrix .",
    "they used this idea in the calculation of ips for small molecular systems using the so called buijse baerends corrected ( bbc ) @xcite and goedecker umrigar ( gu)@xcite functionals and showed that the error in the obtained ips is of the order of 4 - 6% .",
    "the same idea was employed in combination with yet another xc functional , namely the pnof1@xcite functional , for the calculation of the first ips ( fips ) as well as higher ips ( hips ) of molecular systems yielding results of similar quality@xcite .",
    "however , the application of this method is restricted to finite systems , since , for solids , it would require the diagonalization of a large matrix in wave - vector space .",
    "sharma _ et al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "[ ] introduced an alternative technique to obtain spectral information .",
    "we refer to this technique as the `` derivative '' ( der ) method as it entails for each natural orbital , @xmath17 , the associated energy , @xmath18 , be obtained as the derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation number , @xmath19 , at @xmath20 and with the rest of the occupation numbers set equal to their ground - state optimal values .",
    "this technique has been applied for the calculation of densities of states of transition - metal oxides ( nio , feo , coo and mno ) and the results were found to be in excellent agreement with experiments @xcite and other state - of - the - art many - body techniques like dynamical mean - field theory and the @xmath21 method .    in the present work",
    "this technique is applied to finite systems .",
    "we discuss the validity of the approximations necessary for the accuracy of the method .",
    "we present results for the fip as well as hip , for atoms and molecules as well as the eas of atoms , molecules , and radicals adopting several present - day functionals of the 1-rdm .",
    "we compare the results with ekt , qci(t ) , and experiment .",
    ".[tab : errors ] average absolute errors @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , in the calculation of ip , fips and hips , for a set of atoms and molecules with calculations performed using various xc functionals in conjunction with def , dif , der methods respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "our results for the average absolute errors in the calculation of ips with the three methods are included in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "average errors in the results obtained with ekt method are also included in the table .",
    "the actual values for ips obtained using the der method are compiled in table  [ tab : ip ] .",
    "( full results for all methods as well as ekt can be found in the supplementary material@xcite . )",
    "it is clear from table  [ tab : errors ] that all functionals in combination with the der method give reasonable results for ips with errors ranging from 4 to 13% .",
    "ml , ac3 and power functionals perform slightly better by giving an average error of only 4 - 6% . for the systems considered here ,",
    "the ml functional with the der method is the most accurate for the fips ( with an error of only 2% ) .",
    "it is important to note that the errors from the der and ekt method are of the same order ( using the same functionals and basis set ) , while there is less computational effort involved in der method .",
    "the comparison of the dif and der methods allows us to assess the validity of the linear approximation  the linearity of the total energy with respect to variation of one occupation number while keeping the rest of the occupation numbers as well as natural orbitals frozen ( this was demonstrated for solids in ref .",
    "as we see in table  [ tab : ip ] , the der method gives good results also for finite systems and for the best performing functionals the average difference between the dif and der methods results is in the range of 2 - 7% .",
    "this percentage may be regarded as the magnitude of non - linearity of the total energy with respect to variation of a single occupation number .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the def method suffers from the over correlation error due to the approximate nature of the xc functional and the difference in variational freedom between closed and open - shell systems .",
    "since the der method is less prone to this error , it is not a surprise that for the power and ml functionals the der method improves the results over the def method .",
    "this indicates that the dependence of the total energy on a particular occupation number deviates from linearity but this deviation works in favor of the der method by further improving the results . in order to understand this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_nip](top ) , we show the tangents at 1/2 of the total energy as a function of the occupation number of the homo , while keeping the rest frozen .",
    "the plots are made for various functionals .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : e_nip ] that although the total energy functional itself deviates from linearity the tangent at 1/2 is very close to the one that reproduces the experimental results .",
    "one reason for this improvement over the dif method might be that the extension of the theory to open shells in the case the der method is minimal since only half of an electron is unpaired and der method reduces the error introduced by the extension of functionals to open shells .",
    "the average percentage errors and the values of hips for various atoms and molecules are also presented in table  [ tab : errors ] and table  [ tab : ip ] respectively .",
    "the average error in hips obtained using the mller , gu , power and pnof1 functionals , is substantially lower ( 4 - 7% ) than for the fips .",
    "the rest of the functionals are less accurate for hips with average absolute errors slightly higher than those for the fips ( 5 - 10% ) .",
    "the average absolute errors in the calculation of eas with the def , dif , and der methods are shown in table  [ tab : eaerr ] .",
    "the actual values for eas obtained using der method are included in table  [ tab : ea ] .",
    "as already mentioned , eas are more difficult quantities to calculate the errors are introduced by describing negative ions with localized basis which are usually optimized for the description of the ground states of neutral systems .",
    "in addition , being a small quantity , eas are more prone to errors in the differences of total energies corresponding to two different shell structures ( for example the difference in energy between a doublet and a singlet state ) .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the errors in tables  [ tab : eaerr ] and  [ tab : ea ] are substantially higher than for the ips .",
    "however , state - of - the art quantum chemical methods like qci(t ) also exhibit large errors within the adopted basis set . under these considerations",
    "the ac3 , pnof1 and ml functionals perform surprisingly well for eas with average errors of 21.4% , 28.6% , and 21.5% respectively .",
    "these errors are close to that of qci(t ) ( 17.3% ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that ( see table  [ tab : ea ] ) there are only a few cases ( 5 of 60 ) for which mller , gu , bbc3 and power functionals give a zero ea [ @xmath25 , i.e. , the system is not predicted by the corresponding functional to bind an extra electron . for the best performers like the ac3 , pnof1 , and ml functionals , no such case exists .    in order to compare the dif and der methods for the determination of eas , fig .",
    "[ fig : e_nip](bottom ) shows the tangents at 1/2 to the dependence of the total energy on the occupation of the homo of the negative ions f@xmath26 and cl@xmath26 . the exact tangent that reproduces the experimental eas is also shown in the figure .",
    "again , as in the case of ips , the der method not only looks like a reasonable approximation but it also improves on the results of the def method ( for the functionals considered and in all cases studied in the present work ) . in particular , for the case of cl@xmath26 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : e_nip](bottom ) ] the tangents at 1/2 are in very good agreement with the exact tangent that reproduces experimental ea , although the dependence of the total energy on the homo occupation number deviates significantly from linearity .    a striking example of the pathological behavior mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] is the negative ion f@xmath26 .",
    "this system is found experimentally to be energetically lower than the neutral f atom by 3.34  ev ( see table  [ tab : ea ] ) .",
    "all functionals underestimate this energy substantially ( see supplementary material @xcite ) , as a result of the enhanced variational freedom of the open - shell , neutral f atom compared to the closed - shell f@xmath26 . in two extreme cases ( ml and ac3 functionals )",
    "f@xmath26 is found energetically above the neutral f atom .",
    "in summary we examined the performance of the derivative - method proposed in ref .  [ ] for calculation of the ips and eas of finite systems .",
    "the accuracy of ips and eas calculated using the derivative - method are compared to the ips and eas calculated using the definition of these quantities [ which involves two total energy minimizations for the system and the positive ( for ip ) or negative ion ( for ea ) ] . in order to have a complete analysis we have also considered an intermediate method ( difference method ) ,",
    "in which the ips and eas are determined by the difference of the total energies with fixing one occupation number to 1 and/or zero .",
    "all these results are further compared to the state - of - the - art ci method as well as experiments .",
    "we find that , for ips both the difference and derivative methods are good approximations to the definition of this quantity .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the derivative method results , obtained using mller , power , and ml functionals , are better than the values obtained using the definition method itself ( with errors of the order of 4 - 8% only ) . among these functionals",
    "the ml functional in conjunction with derivative method is most accurate with errors of only up to 2% . for the eas",
    "the errors are significantly larger , with the ml functional in conjunction with the derivative method being the most accurate ( with an error of 21% ) .",
    "the errors in eas were found to be comparable to the errors in the ci results .    from the present study",
    "we conclude that the results of the derivative method for ips and eas are in good agreement with experiments and this method is a promising technique to obtain the single - electron spectrum for systems where state - of - the - art quantum chemical methods can not be applied and dft results deviate significantly from experiment ."
