    "in the optical colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) the so called blue stragglers stars ( bss ) are bluer and brighter than the main sequence ( ms ) objects , appearing younger and more massive than the normal cluster stars ( as also confirmed by direct mass measurements , e.g. shara et al .",
    "indeed the bss mass distribution in 47  tucanae ( 47  tuc ) and in ngc  1904 , derived from the star position in the cmd , has been found to peak between 1.1 and 1.2 @xmath6 ( see ferraro et al .",
    "2006a , lanzoni et al .",
    "this suggests that bss increase their initial mass during their evolution .",
    "possible explanations involve the secular ( or induced ) evolution of primordial binary systems and collisions between single and/or binary stars ( hereafter pb - bss and col - bss , respectively ; see mccrea 1964 , e.g. bailyn 1995 , sills et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .    promising chemical and photometric signatures of different bss formation mechanisms have been recently found . in 47",
    "tuc ferraro et al . ( 2006a ) discovered a subpopulation of bss showing a significant depletion of carbon and oxygen , possibly due to a formation through mass transfer activity in pb - bss . in m30",
    "two distinct sequences of bss have been discovered by ferraro et al .",
    "the authors argued that they are populated by bss originated by the two formation channels , both triggered by the collapse of the cluster core a few gyr ago .    in many gcs ( m3 , 47  tuc , ngc  6752 , m5 , m55 , ngc  6388 , m53 , m2 , all references in beccari et al .",
    "2008 ; dalessandro et al . 2008a , b , 2009 )",
    "the projected radial distribution of bss has been found to be bimodal : highly peaked in the centre , with a clear - cut dip at intermediate radii , and with an upturn in the external regions .",
    "dynamical simulations ( mapelli et al . 2004 , 2006 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007a , b ) suggest that the observed central peak is due to col - bss formed in the core and/or pb - bss sunk into the centre because of dynamical friction , while the external rising branch is made of pb - bss evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts .",
    "ngc  1904 ( lanzoni et al . 2007a ) and m75 ( contreras ramos et al . 2012 ) do not show any bimodality , but bss appear more segregated in the central regions than the reference cluster stars . in only three cases ( @xmath7  centauri , ferraro et al .",

    "; pal  14 , beccari et al .",

    "this paper is part of a series devoted to study the uv bright populations ( including horizontal branch -hb , bss and post - asymptotic giant branch stars ) , in old stellar clusters , by means of an extensive survey conducted with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "more than 30 galactic gcs have been observed within this project .",
    "here we present a detailed analysis of the bss population in ngc  6229 .",

    "it probably is a magellanic stream member ( palma et al .",
    "2002 ) and due to its location , it is poorly studied .",
    "the most recent papers are focused on hb stars ( borissova et al . 1997 , 1999 ,",
    "catelan et al . 1998 ) , bss ( borissova et al . 1999 ) , and variable stars ( borissova et al .",
    "however , these papers are based on ground - based observations only , while here we present a study that combines high - resolution observations from space , thus to properly explore , for the very first time , the stellar populations in the cluster core , and wide - field observations from the ground to study the entire cluster extension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the data set and the photometric and astrometric analysis . in section",
    "3 we determine the centre of gravity and present the cmds .",

    "the summary of the paper is presented in section  6 .",
    "in order both to resolve the stars in the crowded central regions , and to cover the entire extension of the cluster , we used a combination of high - resolution and wide - field data , similarly to what already done in our previous studies ( e.g. dalessandro et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the _ high - resolution set _",
    "consists of a series of images collected with the hst / wfpc2 at various wavelengths , ranging from the uv to the optical bands . these images ( prop . 11975 , p.i .",
    "ferraro ) were obtained through the uv filter @xmath9 with total exposure times @xmath10s , and through the optical filters @xmath11 and @xmath12 with exposure times @xmath13s and @xmath14s , respectively .",
    "the centre of the cluster is located in the planetary camera ( pc , pixel scale @xmath15 pixel@xmath16 ) .",
    "the _ wide - field set _ is composed of data obtained with the megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "a series of 11 images taken through the @xmath17 and @xmath18 filters with total exposure times @xmath19s and @xmath20s , respectively , was retrieved from the canadian astronomy data centre .",
    "megacam consists of 36 ccds of @xmath21 pixels each , with a pixel scale of @xmath22 pixel@xmath16 .",
    "the cluster centre is located in chip @xmath2323 .",
    "the one squared degree field of view allowed a complete sampling of the cluster .",
    "all the single wfpc2 images were reduced using the daophotiv package ( stetson 1987 ) . in order to model the point spread function ( psf ) , we selected bright and almost isolated stars in each frame .",
    "we excluded stars lying in the central regions of the pc for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 exposures , because of crowding problems .",
    "typically @xmath24 @xmath25bona fide stars@xmath26 have been used to model the psf in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath27 in the @xmath9 . with the obtained psf models we performed a first psf - fitting on each single image by using allstar . since our analysis",
    "is particularly devoted to hot stars , as master frame for the following reduction we used the stacked image obtained combining the @xmath11 and the @xmath9 exposures , using packages ( stetson 1994 ) .",
    "stars found in the master reference frame have been force - fitted to each single frame by using the allframe package ( stetson 1994 ) . at this point we selected again the psf stars from the allframe catalogue and we repeated the whole procedure . in this way we have minimized the risk of having spurious detections between stars used for the psf modelling and the advantage of choosing @xmath25bona fide stars@xmath26 on the basis of more reliable magnitude and improved centroid determination .",
    "the reduction procedure for the megacam images is the same as for the wfpc2 . in this case , however , the master list for each chip is made by stars identified in at least two out of 11 exposures .",
    "this choice allowed us to get full advantage of the dithering strategy adopted for these observations .",
    "all the catalogues were put on the absolute astrometric system using a large number of stars in common with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalogue . as a first step we obtained the astrometric solution for each of the 36 chips of megacam by using the procedure described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) and the cross - correlation tool cataxcorr ( montegriffo , private communication ) .",
    "all the stars in common with the hst field were then used as secondary astrometric standards in order to put all the catalogues in the same astrometric system .",
    "several hundred astrometric standards have been used in each step , allowing a very precise astrometry for each catalogue . at the end of the procedure",
    "the estimated error in the absolute positions , both in right ascension ( @xmath28 ) and declination ( @xmath29 ) , is of about @xmath30 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the high - resolution set were corrected for charge transfer efficiency by using the equations of dolphin ( 2009 ) .",
    "all the wfpc2 magnitudes ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) were calibrated to the vegamag system by using the prescription by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the zero points from the wfpc2 data handbook . in order to calibrate the megacam magnitudes",
    ", we first transformed the @xmath17 and @xmath18 instrumental magnitudes to the sdss system ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) by using the stars in common with the sloan public catalogues .",
    "we then converted the @xmath34 magnitudes in the @xmath33 vegamag by means of the following colour equation : @xmath36 , obtained by using the stars in common between the two catalogues .    in order to exclude extra - galactic sources from our analysis",
    ", we retrieved a catalogue of these objects from the nasa extragalactic database and we matched it with our catalogues .",
    "we found a total of @xmath37 objects in common ( typically galaxies and quasars ) which were excluded from the following analysis .",
    "thanks to the high - resolution and quality of the wfpc2 images , we determined the centre of gravity @xmath38 of ngc  6229 from resolved stars , by following the iterative procedure described in montegriffo et al .",

    "this new determination is located @xmath46 south - west ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) from the harris centre .",
    "we then used the computed cluster centre to divide the entire data set in two samples which most suitably describe different regions of the system .",

    "the cmds of these samples are shown in figures  3 , 4 , 5 .",
    "as apparent from figure  3 , the evolutionary sequences display the morphology typical of the uv plane ( see ferraro et al .",
    "1997 , 2003 ) , with the hb crossing diagonally the diagram , the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars extending to colours @xmath52 and always being below @xmath53 , and the bss population defining a vertical sequence at @xmath54 , which merges without any discontinuity into the turn - off of the ms at @xmath55 .",
    "the same stars are plotted for comparison in the ( @xmath56 ) plane in the left panel of figure  4 .",
    "the comparison of these two figures shows that at the optical wavelengths the cool objects ( as the rgb stars ) are much brighter than the hot objects ( like bss and hb stars ) , which instead dominate the bright portion of the cmd at uv wavelengths .",
    "for this reason , we decided to select the hot stars of the _ hst sample _ in the uv plane and the cool objects in the optical cmds .",
    "the hb of ngc  6229 has been subject of a number of studies . as suggested by borissova et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and catelan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the hb morphology is characterized by a bimodal distribution in @xmath57 colour and shows at least one gap on the blue hb at @xmath58 .",
    "ngc  6229 is the only outer - halo cluster and one of the four known cases ( the others being ngc  2808 , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) where these two anomalies are simultaneously present .",
    "moreover , borissova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) identified 9 extreme hb stars in this cluster .",
    "the availability of high - resolution cmds , both in the uv and in the optical planes , clearly is a major advantage for a more detailed study of the hb morphology in ngc  6229 .",
    "while this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper , here we use the hb stars only as reference population ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure  4 shows the ( @xmath59 ) cmd for the _ external sample_. as can be seen , the cluster population is well defined and largely dominant over the field stars out to @xmath60 .",
    "indeed the ms of ngc  6229 can be recognized even beyond this distance ( see figure  5 ) , while the galactic field contamination becomes clearly dominant in the most external regions sampled by our data set .",

    "panel d ) shows the region used to determine the field star contamination ; the adopted selection boxes for bss , rgb and hb stars are also marked . ]",
    "we determined the projected density profile of ngc  6229 by measuring the star counts over the entire cluster extension , from @xmath38 to @xmath62 . from the _ hst sample _ we selected fiducial rgb , subgiant branch and bright ms stars with @xmath63 .",
    "the fiducial stars are those within three times the typical photometric error from the ridge mean line of each evolutionary sequence .",
    "the same criterium was adopted to select stars from the _ external sample_. in this case we considered the magnitude interval @xmath64 , thus to limit the strong contamination from field stars in the most external regions , which would be particularly severe along the ( scarcely populated ) rgb .",
    "we divided the entire fov in 18 annuli centred on @xmath38 and each annulus was divided into two or four subsectors , where we computed the ratio between the number of stars and the subsector area .",
    "the stellar density of each annulus is then obtained from the average of the corresponding subsector densities and the errors from the squared root of their variance .",
    "the incomplete area coverage affecting some annulus has been taken into account in this procedure . in order to join the star counts in the inner and outer regions , we determined the density of the _ external sample _ in the annulus @xmath65 using the same magnitude range adopted for the _ hst sample _ ( @xmath63 ) and we used this point to normalize the two distributions .",
    "the resulting radial density profile is shown in figure  6 .",
    "the last three points ( @xmath66 ) have been used to estimate the contribution of the background stars .",
    "the single mass king model that best fits the observed density profile ( see the solid line on figure ) has concentration @xmath67 and core radius @xmath68 .",
    "these values are consistent with those ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) quoted by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ) , who however fit the surface brightness ( instead of the surface density ) profile , only out to @xmath71 .",
    "our fit well reproduces the central part of the profile and confirms that ngc  6229 has not experienced the collapse of the core yet , as suggested by djorgovski & king ( 1986 ) , trager et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , borissova et al .",
    "however , neither our best - fit model , nor those found in the literature are able to properly reproduce the external density profile ( see the figure ) .",
    "in fact , the best - fit king model systematically underpredicts the number counts for @xmath5 and a prominent ms belonging to the cluster is well appreciable beyond the nominal tidal radius of the model , set at @xmath60 ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "this discrepancy requires a more detailed investigation , which is out of the scope of the present paper .    .",
    "for the _ hst sample _ we selected the bss population in the ( @xmath72 ) diagram .",
    "the adopted selection box is shown in figure  3 . in order to avoid the contamination from ms turn - off stars , we limit the sample to @xmath73 . within this threshold , we identify 60 bss in the _ hst sample _ , which are also shown in the left panel of figure  4 and turn out to span the magnitude range @xmath74 . because of the quality of the optical cmd , the bss selection in the _ external sample _ is quite straightforward .",
    "we used the same magnitude limits inferred in the optical plane by stars selected in the uv , while the extension in colour has been set by the four candidate bss visible in this diagram at @xmath75 .",
    "the selection box is shown in grey in the figure .",
    "interestingly enough the most external bss lies at @xmath76 from the centre , i.e. well within the cluster tidal radius .",
    "thus the final sample of bss counts 64 objects in the surveyed region of the cluster .",
    "a preliminary study of the bss population at @xmath77 has been presented by borissova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , using optical ground - based data .",
    "it is not possible to compare that sample with our much higher resolution hst data covering the central and most crowded region of the cluster .",
    "however , when comparing the ground - based data in the outskirts of the cluster , we find that the number ( 4 ) of bss at @xmath50 in the _ external sample _ is in good agreement with the number ( 5 ) quoted by borissova et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .      as already discussed in other papers ( see e. g. ferraro et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) in order to study the bss properties , we need to select also a reference population representative of the normal cluster stars . to this end",
    ", we consider both the hb and the rgb populations . since the hb of ngc  6229 is bimodal ( borissova et al .",
    "1997 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) and it is populated by stars cooler and hotter than the instability strip , we decided to select hb stars by using both the uv and the optical planes , when possible .",
    "in fact the ( @xmath31 , @xmath78 ) guarantees a solid selection of the blue hb stars , while it is strongly incomplete for stars with @xmath79 , which are instead among the brightest objects in the optical plane .",
    "we first selected hb stars in the uv plane by using the selection box shown in figure  3 .",
    "thanks to the adopted photometric reduction method , all the stars selected in this way are also identified in the ( @xmath33 , @xmath80 ) plane and they lie at @xmath81 .",
    "we then built a selection box in the optical cmd including both the stars identified in the uv and the hb stars redder than @xmath82 ( see left panel of figure  4 ) .",
    "this selection allows us to identify all the hb stars and to obtain the magnitude limits for the selection in the outermost regions of the cluster .",
    "in fact , since no uv filters are available for the _ external sample _ , we selected hb stars in the ( @xmath83 ) cmd by using the same magnitude limits ( @xmath84 ) used in the optical cmd of the _",
    "hst sample_. all the 30 known rr lyrae stars at @xmath85 ( borissova et al .",
    "2001 ) located in our fov have been included in the hb selection .",
    "considering the entire fov , from @xmath38 to @xmath60 , we identify 339 hb stars , 299 in the _ hst sample _ and 40 in the _ external sample_. to select the rgb stars we used the optical cmds , where these objects are bright and the branch well defined . in order to reduce the contamination from subgiant and asymptotic giant branch stars , we limit our selection to @xmath86 .",

    "we exploit the huge fov covered by the megacam catalogue , that allows us to statistically quantify the contamination of the field stars well beyond @xmath51 .",
    "in particular we used the cmd obtained for @xmath93 , where field stars define two vertical sequences roughly located at @xmath94 and @xmath95 . by counting the number of stars lying within the boxes used for the population selections",
