    "the ( asymmetric ) shapes of the dumbbells and the couplings to the external field can be adjusted independently by varying the bead radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as the coupling parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the complete conformation of the system ( up to a rotation of the whole system ) can be described by the distance @xmath59 between the hydrodynamic centers of the dumbbells , @xmath60 as well as the conformation angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are given by @xmath63 the hydrodynamic interactions between the dumbbells induce a slow rotation of @xmath17 and oscillations of d(t ) around some mean distance as indicated by figure [ 2_dumb_sketch1 ] .",
    "the frequency @xmath64 of these oscillations is the rotation frequency of the dumbbell axes @xmath42 and @xmath65 with respect to @xmath66 .",

    "the dumbbell dynamics is considerably simplified for equally asymmetric shapes of the two dumbbells , @xmath68 , and equal couplings , @xmath69 .",
    "if the two dumbbells are also equally oriented , as sketched in figure [ 2_dumb_sketch1](a ) , the phase angles are equal , @xmath70 , and the conformation angles are identical for all times , @xmath71 . for two",
    "oppositely oriented dumbbells the phase difference has the constant value @xmath72 whereas the conformation angles add up to @xmath73 .    according to the symmetry of the system , the distance @xmath59 between the hydrodynamic centers of two equally oriented dumbbells oscillates around a mean distance with the frequency @xmath74 as indicated by the sketch in figure [ 2_dumb_sketch1](a ) .",
    "the corresponding oscillation period is @xmath75 , which is shown for a specific parameter set in figure [ conformation_versus_time](a ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the distance @xmath59 for two dumbbells with opposite shape orientation oscillates with a period of @xmath76 being twice as long as in the former case . for comparison we show the @xmath77 component of the driving field @xmath78 in figure [ conformation_versus_time](c ) , which illustrates the inequality of the frequencies , @xmath79 , and thus the inequality of the oscillation periods @xmath80 .    in figure [ conformation_versus_time](b )",
    "the oscillatory contribution @xmath81 to the phase @xmath82 is shown .",
    "since the coupling strengths of the dumbbells are constant , the oscillation of @xmath83 about a linearly growing part confirms that the rotational hydrodynamic drag changes as a function of the relative orientation of the dumbbell axes with respect to @xmath17 . in the case of equally oriented dumbbells",
    "the viscous drag is maximal in the ranges about the conformation angles @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) where fluid between the dumbbells is squeezed out or sucked into the region between the dumbbells .",
    "these are also the phases of the rotation during which the repulsion ( resp . attraction ) between the dumbbells is strongest .    according to the symmetry of the system",
    "the attractive forces acting between the two dumbbells in one quarter of a period ( @xmath86 ) are compensated during the consecutive quarter ( @xmath87 ) by repulsive forces of the same magnitude .",
    "this causes an oscillation of @xmath59 with the frequency @xmath88 around some mean value , but without a net attraction or repulsion . in the case of oppositely oriented dumbbells two consecutive maxima of the viscous drag",
    "have different amplitudes and therefore the attractive and repulsive hydrodynamic forces do not cancel each other completely during one half of an oscillation period but during a whole rotation with the period @xmath89 .    during the rotation the viscous drag acting on the inner beads , which are closer to the respective other dumbbell ,",
    "is higher than the drag on the outer beads of the dumbbells .",
    "these differing drag forces induce an oscillation of the phase angles @xmath90 during the rotation .    in the ranges of increasing ( decreasing ) viscous",
    "drag the rotation frequency @xmath64 of the dumbbell axes decreases ( increases ) . when @xmath64 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath24 the phase delays @xmath90 of the dumbbells decrease ( increase ) .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath59 and @xmath91 are shown as a function of time for two different values of the coupling constants in figure [ phase_lag_weak_and_strong ] . in part",
    "( a ) the coupling to the driving field is weak , @xmath92 , and in part ( b ) the coupling is strong , @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations of the distance are the same in both cases .",
    "is contrast to that the phase lag @xmath94 of the dumbbell axes with respect to the orientation of the external field is smaller in the case of large values of the coupling .",
    "moreover the diagrams in figure [ phase_lag_weak_and_strong ] show that the oscillations of @xmath94 are in phase with the oscillations of the distance in the case of strong couplings to the external field .",
    "contrary to that @xmath91 is delayed with respect to @xmath59 for weak couplings .",
    "the reason for this delay is the following : while the distance between the dumbbells increases the drag on the dumbbells also grows .",
    "so the rotation frequency @xmath64 of the dumbbells must decrease .",
    "as soon as it is below @xmath24 the phase angle @xmath94 grows and so does the torque on the dumbbells ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "but for weak couplings the torque builds up much slower than for strong couplings .",
    "so for small coupling constants even in the beginning of the domain where the distance ( and thus the drag ) decreases @xmath94 is still growing because the torque is too weak . at some point",
    "the torque is large enough to overcome the drag so that @xmath94 decreases again afterwards .",
    "an analogous argument holds in the ranges where @xmath59 is increasing .",
    "the shift between the curves of @xmath59 and @xmath91 has to be smaller than a quarter of an oscillation period in our considerations because otherwise the field @xmath13 would be too weak to enforce a synchronous rotation of the dumbbells at all .    for strong couplings",
    "there are small dips at the maxima of @xmath91 .",
    "these correspond to local minima of the drag , which occur when the dumbbells are aligned with each other so that the four beads lie on a single line . in this conformation",
    "the distance between the dumbbells is maximal .",
    "an equivalent phenomenon can be seen in the plot of @xmath91 for weak coupling .",
    "of course there is also a local minimum of the drag when the dumbbells are aligned with each other and the distance is maximal . but due to the weak torque acting at that stage there is no dip but only a slight flattening of the curve in this case .",
    "in the coordinate system rotating with the connection vector @xmath17 the conformation after one period @xmath89 maps on top of the original conformation . the reciprocity of the motion is illustrated in figure [ d_versus_psi ] , where the distance @xmath96 is plotted as a function of the conformation angle @xmath83 for weak couplings , @xmath97 , in part a ) and strong couplings , @xmath98 , in part b ) .",
    "both curves are invariant under the transformation @xmath99 .",
    "this underlines the reciprocity of the motion as it can already be seen in the plot of @xmath59 which is invariant under time reversal @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to that the curves for weak and strong couplings are identical in the conformation space @xmath101 as shown in figure [ d_versus_psi ] .",
    "in fact the trajectories shown are universal for all values of the coupling constants as long as they are large enough so that the dumbbells can follow the field @xmath13 synchronously .",
    "however , the rate of change of the conformation angle @xmath102 along the curves depends very much on the coupling parameters ( cf .",
    "figure [ phase_lag_weak_and_strong ] ) .",
    "this is indicated by the color code along the two curves , where red and blue mark the rates @xmath102 below and above the angular frequency @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that irrespective of the strength of the driving field the dumbbells pass through the same set of conformations during one cycle , although each conformation is passed at a different rate , as indicated by the distribution of the different colors along both lines .",
    "the reciprocity of the motion ensures that for a given rotational frequency the distance of the dumbbells described by the stokesian dynamics is locked to the individual orientation of the dumbbells with respect to @xmath17 and returns to the same value after one period .      for two differently shaped dumbbells or for different couplings to the external field the phase difference @xmath14 and the distance @xmath59",
    "are plotted as functions of the time in figure [ ps_2_dumb ] for two different sets of parameters . for comparison",
    "also the @xmath77-component @xmath103 of the driving field is shown .",
    "in contrast to the previous section the phase difference @xmath104 oscillates in time . the time dependence is different for different parameters as indicated in figure [ ps_2_dumb](a ) for the parameters @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and in figure [ ps_2_dumb](b ) for the parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .    in the previous section @xmath59",
    "was either oscillating with the frequency @xmath74 or @xmath64 , but in both cases @xmath59 was symmetric with respect to a reflection of time , cf .",
    "figure [ phase_lag_weak_and_strong ] . here",
    "both , @xmath59 and @xmath104 , are not symmetric anymore with respect to time reflection .",
    "as in the case of equally asymmetric dumbbells the viscous drag is a function of the angles which the dumbbell axes enclose with the vector @xmath17 .",
    "there are also ranges of the phase angles , in which liquid is squeezed out between the dumbbells and others where fluid is sucked in . as",
    "a consequence the length of the vector @xmath17 is also oscillating here , i. e. there are phase ranges of dumbbell attraction , which are followed by phases of dumbbell repulsion and so on .    for finite values of @xmath113 , which are a consequence of the broken symmetry ,",
    "the conformation angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 differ from each other .",
    "combined with the hydrodynamic interactions , which depend nonlinearly on the distances between the beads , the magnitude and the directions of the forces between the beads during one rotation cycle are quite complex",
    ". therefore the trajectories in the configurational space are not universal anymore .    for one parameter set the distance d(t )",
    "is plotted as a function of the conformation angle @xmath61 in figure [ distdumbbell](a ) .",
    "it is clear from first sight that the behavior is much more complex here than in the case of equally asymmetric dumbbells with equal couplings , which was shown in figure [ d_versus_psi ] . especially the magnitudes of the attraction and repulsion between the dumbbells during the different stages of the motion are different here .",
    "so a priori it is not clear anymore whether the dumbbells can attract or repel each other during a whole rotational period . in order to illustrate the complex behavior of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath61 in more detail , figure [ distdumbbell](b )",
    "shows the derivative @xmath114 . in the ranges of the conformation angle @xmath61 where this function is positive",
    "the dumbbells repel each other and when the function is negative they attract each other .",
    "the fourier modes of this function are given in figure [ fourierpsi ] . in this spectrum",
    "one can clearly see that there is a non - vanishing coefficient of zeroth order which means that the distance between the dumbbells changes during a complete dumbbell rotation .",
    "but it is also obvious that this net repulsive or attractive effect is superimposed by much stronger oscillations .",
    "so it is not possible to determine in which phase of the motion the decisive effect takes place that causes the overall repulsion or attraction .",
    "in fact all coefficients from @xmath115 @xmath116 up to @xmath117 @xmath118 are larger than the zero order coefficient .",
    "as shown above the mean distance between two unequally shaped dumbbells may increase , as sketched in figure [ 2_dumb_sketch1](b ) , or decreases as a function of time . in figure [ distance_short_repulsion_attraction ]",
    "we have plotted @xmath59 for the same parameter sets as in figure [ ps_2_dumb ] , but for a longer time window .",
    "one can easily see that in the mean the dumbbells repel each other in part a ) and attract each other in part b ) . how the hydrodynamically induced repulsive or attractive dumbbell motion depends on the parameters , describing the system s asymmetry , is illustrated in terms of diagrams for representative sets of parameters in figures [ phase_diagram_m1_m2]-[phase_diagram_a1_m1 ] .    in figure [ phase_diagram_m1_m2 ]",
    "areas of dumbbell attraction and repulsion are shown as a function of the two coupling parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the fixed parameters , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , corresponding to unequal dumbbell shapes . for combinations of the two couplings along the solid lines in figure [ phase_diagram_m1_m2 ] ,",
    "the bead asymmetries of the dumbbells are compensated by the difference between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that the distance @xmath59 is constant in the mean . if one coupling parameter is much larger than the other one ( @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) the dumbbells attract each other . between those two regimes",
    "there is a range of parameters for which the dumbbells repel each other . for increasing coupling constants",
    "the repulsive area widens .    in figure [ phase_diagram_a1_a3 ] the regions of dumbbell attraction and repulsion",
    "are shown as functions of the two bead radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 for fixed coupling constants , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for these parameters there is only a narrow domain , in which the dumbbells attract each other . in this area",
    "the dumbbell asymmetries differ only about @xmath121 .",
    "the phase diagram in figure [ phase_diagram_a1_a3 ] also shows that for identical asymmetries of the two dumbbells , @xmath68 , one may have either dumbbell repulsion , as in the case @xmath122 , or attraction , as in the case @xmath123 .    in figure [ phase_diagram_a1_m1 ] the coupling @xmath108 and the asymmetry @xmath124 of one of the dumbbells",
    "were fixed , whereas the asymmetry @xmath125 as well as the coupling parameter @xmath53 is varied . for a symmetric or slightly asymmetric dumbbell ,",
    "i.e. @xmath126 , there is always attraction , but for stronger asymmetries there are also regions , where the two dumbbells repel each other . even for equal couplings ( @xmath127 )",
    "one can find areas of dumbbell attraction as well as regions in which the dumbbells repel each other .",
    "away from the solid lines of vanishing attraction and repulsion in figure [ phase_diagram_m1_m2 ] , [ phase_diagram_a1_a3 ] or [ phase_diagram_a1_m1 ] the modulus of the relative velocity between the dumbbells increases with the distance from these lines .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ slice_through_pd_m1_m2 ] , where the mean relative velocity between the dumbbells is shown as a function of the coupling @xmath54 . in this figure",
    "the same parameter set as in figure [ phase_diagram_m1_m2 ] was used and @xmath107 was fixed . in this case the transitions from attraction to repulsion and back occur at the values @xmath128 and @xmath129 and there is only a small range of values of @xmath54 for which the dumbbells repel each other .",
    "is there a simple mechanism by which the attractive or repulsive behavior can be explained ? as shown before , the broken time reversal symmetry of @xmath59 is necessary for the non - reciprocal motion of the dumbbells to occur .",
    "furthermore for some parameter sets the phase shift @xmath14 between the dumbbells as well as its modulation amplitude has a minimum in the repulsive regime .",
    "however , this depends very much on the parameters being used . for other parameter sets",
    "@xmath14 takes its maximum value in the range in which the dumbbells repel each other . for a third class of parameter sets",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the phase shift and the fact that the dumbbells behave in an attractive or a repulsive way .",
    "all in all the mechanism leading to dumbbell attraction or repulsion is a complex interplay between the applied torques resulting from the coupling parameters and the drag forces , which depend on the bead radii and thus on the asymmetries of the dumbbells .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating asymmetric dumbbells in a fluid at a low reynolds number were investigated .",
    "we found either a temporally averaged attraction or repulsion between the dumbbells if they have different shapes and/or their couplings to the driving field differ .",
    "differences in shape and/or coupling break the time reversal symmetry , and are hence a pre - condition for attraction or repulsion .",
    "no generic rule could be identified of whether a specific form of symmetry breaking leads to dumbbell attraction or repulsion .",
    "we presented phase diagrams separating parameter regions of attraction from regions of repulsion .",
    "we suggest experiments where anisotropic birefringent particles are rotated by circularly polarized light , similar to recent experiments @xcite , in order to explore the hydrodynamic attraction and repulsion between rotating small particles . in such experiments the torque on an anisotropic particle",
    "may easily be tuned by varying the laser power .",
    "different torques may also be applied to the particles by using different shapes or materials for the particles .",
    "a spatially varying power of the circularly polarized light can also cause different torques on neighboring particles .",
    "dumbbells or anisotropic particles can also be constructed from super - paramagnetic particles which can be rotated using a magnetic field . in this case",
    "the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions have to be taken into account .",
    "magic angle spinning may suppress the magnetic dipole or multipole interactions @xcite such that the hydrodynamic interactions dominate .",
    "if the hydrodynamic interactions of an assembly of asymmetric objects are investigated , collective dynamics such as chaotic motion can be expected .",
