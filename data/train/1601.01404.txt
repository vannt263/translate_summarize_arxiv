    "2013 ; de looze et al . 2014 ; fischer et al .",
    "2014 ; sargsyan et al .",
    "2014 ) . among these lines ,",
    "the [ cii ] 158 @xmath3 m  emission is probably the most important and well studied , since it is the brightest single line in most galaxies and accounts for 0.1 - 1% of the total fir luminosity",
    "( e.g. stacey et al . 1991 ; diaz - santos et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the [ nii]205@xmath3 m  line is of particular interest for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , this @xmath18p@xmath19p@xmath20 transition ( 205.197 @xmath3 m ; hereafter [ nii]@xmath0 ) of singly ionized nitrogen is expected to be an excellent indicator of star formation rate ( sfr ) based on the following facts : 1 ) the ionization potential of nitrogen is only 14.53 ev . thus the [ nii]@xmath0  emission arises only from hii  regions , and essentially traces all warm ionized ism .",
    "it can be utilized to estimate the ionizing photon rate ( e.g. bennett et al . 1994 ) ; 2 ) the [ nii]@xmath0  transition can be easily collisionally excited because of its low critical density ( 44 cm@xmath13 ; oberst et al .",
    "2006 ) and excitation energy ( @xmath8 70 k ) ; 3 ) this emission is usually optically thin and suffers much less dust extinction than optical and near infrared lines . indeed , zhao et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have shown that the [ nii]@xmath0  line can serve as a sfr indicator , which is especially useful for studying high - redshift galaxies for which the redshifted [ nii]@xmath0  line is readily obtainable with modern submillimeter telescopes such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .    secondly , this line can provide complementary information on the origin of the [ cii ] 158 @xmath3 m  emission ( e.g. oberst et al .",
    "2006 ; walter et al . 2009 ; decarli et al . 2014 ; parkin et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ; hughes et al .",
    "the [ cii ]  line can arise from both neutral and ionized gases since it takes only 11.3 ev to form c@xmath21 , while the ionization potential of hydrogen is 13.60 ev . therefore , it is important to know what fraction of the observed [ cii ]  line emission is from the ionized gas for the study of star - forming regions such as photodissociation region ( pdr ) modeling .",
    "fortunately , the critical densities for the [ nii]@xmath0  and [ cii ]  158 @xmath3 m lines in ionized regions are nearly identical ( 44 and 46 cm@xmath13 at @xmath22 k , respectively ; oberst et al .",
    "2006 ) , and both require similar ionization potentials to further form n@xmath23 ( 29.6 ev ) and c@xmath23 ( 24.4 ev ) . as a result ,",
    "the [ cii]/[nii]@xmath0  line ratio from ionized gas is a function of only the assumed n@xmath21/c@xmath21 abundances within the hii  region , and therefore the observed [ cii]/[nii]@xmath0  line ratio yields the fraction of the [ cii ]  emission that arises from the ionized gas ( oberst et al .",
    "2006 , 2011 ) .",
    "thirdly , the ratio of the [ nii ]  122 @xmath3 m  to 205 @xmath3 m  lines ( hereafter @xmath24 ) is an excellent density probe of low - density ionized gas due to their different critical densities ( @xmath25 ) required for the collisional excitations and being at the same ionization level . at an electron temperature of 8000 k ,",
    "@xmath25 are @xmath26 and 44 cm@xmath13 for the [ nii ]  122 and 205 @xmath3 m lines , respectively ( oberst et al .",
    "2006 ) . therefore , @xmath24 is sensitive to gas densities of @xmath27 cm@xmath13 ( oberst et al .",
    "2006 , 2011 ; also see  3.3 ) .",
    "however , the [ nii]@xmath0  line is generally inaccessible to ground - based facilities for local galaxies , and for extragalactic objects , only a handful were observed using satellite and airborne platforms ( petuchowski et al . 1994 ; lord et al .",
    "1995 ) prior to the advent of the herschel space observatory ( hereafter _ herschel _ ; pilbratt et al .",
    "these studies have shown that the [ nii]@xmath0  line is fairly bright , and the luminosity of [ nii]@xmath0  line ( @xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$ ] ) may be up to @xmath8@xmath28 times the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath2 ; @xmath29 ; also see zhao et al .",
    "with such a high luminosity , this line offers an excellent method for studying sfr and ionized gas properties in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the advantage of [ nii]@xmath0  line over other fir lines , such as [ cii]158@xmath3 m , [ nii]@xmath15  and [ oiii]@xmath3088@xmath3 m , is that it starts to fall into atmospheric sub / millimeter windows that have higher transmission at lower-@xmath31 , due to its longer wavelength .",
    "the detectability of the [ nii]@xmath0  line and its potential for important astrophysical applications at high-@xmath31 have already been demonstrated by a few experimental alma observing campaigns of a galaxy at @xmath32 ( nagao et al 2012 ) , and by the iram 30 m telescope and plateau de bure interferometer detection of distant , strongly lensed galaxies ( combes et al .",

    "the observations were conducted with the spire / fts in its point source spectroscopy mode and high spectral resolution configuration , yielding a spectral resolution of 0.04 cm@xmath12 ( or 1.2 ghz ) over the spectral coverage of 194 - 672 @xmath3 m .",
    "the data were reduced using the default version of the standard spire reduction and calibration pipeline for point source mode included in the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ; ott 2010 ) version 11.0 .    in most cases",

    "( 2013 ) , the line fluxes were obtained by fitting the observed profile using the instrumental _ sinc _ function convolved with a free - width gaussian profile .",

    "given the instrumental resolution ( @xmath8300kms@xmath12  at 210@xmath3 m ) , the observed line might be marginally resolved and could not be modeled by a pure _ sinc _ function .",
    "therefore , we adopted the sinc - convolved - gaussian ( scg ) profiles for the integrated [ nii ]  line flux measurements except for a few galaxies where a pure _ sinc _ profile was a better choice due to the intrinsically narrow line width and/or relatively low s / n in the line . during the fitting process",

    "( 2015 ) , the combination of the [ cii ]  158 @xmath3 m  [ or co(7 - 6 ) ] and [ nii]@xmath0  emissions can be used to estimate the @xmath7  ( see their equations 4 , 5 and 6 ) , and hence we are able to obtain a more accurate sfr for those high - redshift galaxies if both lines are measured .    however , for the application to high-@xmath31 galaxies , an issue that should be explored further is whether our sfr indicator depends on metallicity as some sources at higher redshifts might have significantly lower metallicities .",
    "indeed , low - metallicity systems ( @xmath8@xmath190 ) at high-@xmath31 have already been observed ( capak et al . 2015 ) . in our sample , there is one galaxy , eso 350-ig 038 ( haro 11 ) , which has a relatively low gaseous metallicity value of @xmath80.48 @xmath191 ( guseva et al .",

    "we also found that another dwarf galaxy , he 2 - 10 ( @xmath193 ; guseva et al .",
    "2011 ) , has _",
    "herschel _  fts observations ( obsid : 1342245083 ; pi : v. lebouteiller ) .",
    "the derived @xmath192})$ ] for he 2 - 10 is @xmath194 @xmath195 , where the sfr was calculated using the fir and uv fluxes adopted from leitherer et al .",
    "these two sfr/@xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$ ]  ratios are both within @xmath47 of the fitted relation at their colors @xmath196 .",
    "hence , it seems that the [ nii]@xmath0  emission is not very sensitive to metallicity .",
    "it might also be simply because the uv radiation field has a stronger influence on the [ nii ]  emission than metallicity does , given the fact that a lower metallicity will result in a stronger uv radiation field ( e.g. binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , cormier et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found that the average @xmath1122\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$]/@xmath2  ratios for their dwarf galaxy sample with @xmath197 and for the metal rich sample in brauher et al .",
    "( 2008 ) only differ by a factor of @xmath82 , which is very small compared to the effects on the [ oiii]88@xmath3 m  line .",
    "hence , the [ nii]@xmath0  line is not expected to strongly depend on metallicity down to @xmath198 if we assume that [ nii]@xmath0/[nii]@xmath15  is not a strong function of metallicity , which is reasonable .",
    "therefore , the [ nii]@xmath0  emission is one of the fir tracers least affected by metallicity effects , and can serve as a useful sfr indicator for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "as shown in  3.1 , the [ nii ]  emission can be used as a sfr calibrator , which is particularly useful for high - redshift galaxies observable with submillimeter spectroscopic facilities such as alma .",
    "therefore , besides its own evolution , studying the [ nii ]  lfs at different redshifts can probe the evolution of sfr density . in the following",
    "we derive the local [ nii ]  lf using the data observed by _ herschel _  and",
    "_ iso_. the final sample ( hereafter lf sample ) used to compute the local [ nii ]  lf contains 195 sources , in which 163 galaxies have a [ nii ]  detection , and the remaining 32 objects only have an upper limit on the [ nii ]  flux . for the _ iso _  galaxies , @xmath77205\\,\\mu { \\rm m}}$ ]  was converted from @xmath77122\\,\\mu { \\rm m}}$ ]  using the method described in  2.2.2 .",

    "therefore , considering the breadth of our sample , we are able to use the so - called bivariate method ( see , e.g. , xu et al .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present the measurements of the [ nii]@xmath0  line for a flux - limited sample of 122 ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies [ ( u)lirgs ] and 20 additional normal galaxies , obtained with the herschel space observatory ( _ herschel _ ) . we explore the far - infrared ( fir ) </S>",
    "<S> color dependence of the [ nii]@xmath0  ( @xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$ ] ) to the total infrared ( @xmath2 ) luminosity ratio , and find that @xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$]/@xmath2  only depends modestly on the 70-to-160 @xmath3 m  flux density ratio ( @xmath4 ) when @xmath5 , whereas such dependence becomes much steeper for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the relation between @xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$ ]  and star formation rate ( sfr ) , and show that @xmath1205\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$ ]  has a nearly linear correlation with sfr , albeit the intercept of such relation varies somewhat with @xmath7 , consistent with our previous conclusion that [ nii]@xmath0  emission can serve as a sfr indicator with an accuracy of @xmath80.4 dex , or @xmath80.2 dex if @xmath7  is known independently . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , together with the iso measurements of [ nii ] , we use a total of @xmath8200 galaxies to derive the local [ nii]@xmath0  luminosity function ( lf ) by tying it to the known ir lf with a bivariate method . as a practical application </S>",
    "<S> , we also compute the local sfr volume density ( @xmath9 ) using the newly derived sfr calibrator and lf . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath10 @xmath11yr@xmath12mpc@xmath13 agrees well with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we determine the electron densities ( @xmath14 ) of the ionized medium for a subsample of 12 ( u)lirgs with both [ nii]@xmath0  and [ nii]@xmath15  data , and find that @xmath14 is in the range of @xmath8@xmath16 cm@xmath13 , with a median value of 22 cm@xmath13 . </S>"
