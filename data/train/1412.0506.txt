    "relatively recently it has been discovered that light propagation in an artificial meta - material can be strongly modified , to the extent that this material can become one - way invisible by controlling the parity - time ( @xmath0)-symmetry . such unidirectional invisibility has been predicted @xcite for diffraction on a complex refractive index perturbation profile : @xmath1 , which can be realized in practice as the combination of an index grating ( real grating ) and a balanced gain / loss grating ( imaginary grating ) using the euler relation @xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown in the case of a one - dimensional @xmath0 symmetric grating that when a beam of light is incident on one side of such a meta - material it is transmitted without any reflection , absorption or phase modulation , which amounts to invisibility of the medium @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric gratings have been extensively studied in one - dimensional structures like waveguides @xcite-@xcite , whereas only a few papers @xcite have addressed diffraction on @xmath0-symmetric gratings in free - space configuration or two - dimensional geometries , as in the case of computer - generated holograms . in these publications",
    "the diffractive properties were analyzed on the basis of coupled wave differential equations in which second - order derivatives were neglected .",
    "such an approach is justified for one - dimensional gratings in optical waveguides where the gratings represent weak modulation of the refractive index ( its real and/or imaginary part ) without any significant changes in its average value in the grating portion of the waveguide . in the case of slab gratings , illustrated in fig .  1 ,",
    "neglecting the second derivatives of the field amplitudes is equivalent to neglecting the boundary effects , i.e. the bulk diffracted orders are retained while the waves produced at the boundaries are eliminated .",
    "such an approximation could lead to significant errors . in the case of @xmath0-symmetric gratings , where the diffraction modes have a very unusual interaction mechanism",
    ", it is very important to study how the slab boundaries affect the diffraction and how they affect invisibility in the two - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric volume grating .",
    "we have therefore analyzed diffraction from such a slab by using the full , second - order maxwell equations . in sec .",

    "this applies for an arbitrary ratio between the index and gain / loss modulations , allowing us to track properties from standard index grating to a @xmath0 symmetric grating at the symmetry - breaking point . then in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] we specialize to this latter grating . due to the particular directed structure of the coupled equations we are able to derive analytic expressions for the first three diffractive orders , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the following sections [ fs]-[antisymm ] we use these expressions to analyze the properties of the @xmath0-grating in a variety of different configurations characterized by the values of the background diffractive index within and on either side of the slab , including a possible reflective layer at the back of the slab .",

    "7(b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "it seems clear that it is reflection from the interface between the slab and region 3 that produces the major contribution to the reflective diffraction .",
    "if that is the case , then intuitively the reflective diffraction orders can be significantly reduced by illuminating from the air , as shown in fig .",

    "8(b ) and fig .",
    "the second - order diffraction is also negligible compared to the first order , so that practically all the light diffracted by the @xmath0-symmetric volume grating goes into the first transmissive diffraction order .      to conclude this analysis of the @xmath0-symmetric transmission grating we propose a method to reverse its first transmission order into reflection",
    "this can be done by placing an aluminum layer between the slab and the substrate .",
    "if this aluminum layer is of the order of one micron in thickness then any influence of the substrate will be shielded .",
    "such a structure can be accurately simulated by assigning the dielectric permittivity of region 3 the aluminum permittivity at @xmath20=0.633 @xmath17 m , namely @xmath142 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the reflection now becomes dominant in zeroth order , as well as for first - order diffraction .",
    "the peak in the reflection spectrum ( dashed blue curve ) is now at least an order of magnitude stronger than that in the transmission spectrum ( solid red curve .",
    "in a normal ( index ) grating , the situation is symmetric between @xmath36 and @xmath143 .",

    "more generally @xmath146 corresponds to @xmath147 , where @xmath40 labels the diffraction order .",
    "however , in a balanced @xmath0 grating , this symmetry is lost because the index modulation has an inbuilt direction ( it is symmetric under @xmath0 , but not under @xmath148 itself ) . so in the situation we have been describing in the bulk of the paper , illustrated in fig .",
    "10(a ) , light incident near the first bragg angle produces strong signals in first - order diffraction , particularly in transmission .",
    "in contrast , for incidence at @xmath36 near @xmath149 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we have called the grating  balanced \" when the perturbation of the refractive index is @xmath151 , resulting in @xmath152 and the consequences explored in the paper .",
    "however , if the phase of the gain / loss modulation relative to the index modulation is reversed , @xmath153 instead becomes @xmath154 and the roles of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are interchanged , so that now @xmath155 . in that case",
    "the first mode to be excited is @xmath156 , and the coupled equations for @xmath3 and @xmath145 become    [ bpachangesign ] & & + ^2  s_0(u)=0 + & & & & + s_-1(u)+_1 s_0(u)=0 , giving a strong excitation of @xmath145 near @xmath144 .",
    "thus the symmetry @xmath157 of a normal index grating is regained _ provided _ that the phase of the gain / loss modulation is reversed at the same time .",
    "another prominent characteristic of a balanced @xmath0 grating in the paraxial approximation is invisibility @xcite , that is to say that the transmission coefficient @xmath71 of the undiffracted wave is unity .",
    "however , this approximation can not account for reflections at the boundaries .",
    "the main part of our paper has been to find to analytic solutions of the full second - derivative equations for the first three diffractive orders . with the help of these solutions we have analyzed diffraction from the slab in a variety of different configurations .",
    "the invisibility property has been shown to hold only in the filled - space situation , when the background refractive indices are the same , but when this is not the case the reflections produced by the second - order equations result in a significant reduction of @xmath89 .",
    "the linear rise with grating strength of the first - order transmission amplitude , already seen in paraxial approximation , persists when the full second - order equations are used , making @xmath72 by far the strongest signal for the range of parameters we considered .    in sections",
