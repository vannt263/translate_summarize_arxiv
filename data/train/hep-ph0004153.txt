    "let us assume that a vector boson @xmath13 [ here @xmath13 could be either a fundamental state , like the @xmath14 , or a quark - antiquark bound state like the @xmath15 , or @xmath16 couples to @xmath10 .",
    "if it couples also to @xmath17 as all the states above do then by unitarity its exchange contributes also to @xmath18 .",
    "let us write the effective coupling between the vector boson @xmath13 and @xmath10 as @xmath19 this coupling , through the diagram of fig .",
    "1 , contributes to the @xmath20 amplitude a term @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the effective coupling of the vector boson @xmath13 to @xmath17 , while @xmath23 .   to @xmath17 , which contribute to this process",
    "these have not been included in the above , since they do not change our qualitative discussion .",
    "these couplings are , however , taken into account in the @xmath24 bounds given in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 9 ) below . ] as a first approximation , it is sensible to neglect @xmath25 in comparison with @xmath26 .",
    "then comparing the above contribution to the @xmath0 process to that of ordinary muon decay , @xmath27 , which proceeds via @xmath28 exchange and ( almost ) identical kinematics , gives the relation : @xmath29_{v-{\\rm exch.}}}{\\gamma(\\mu\\to e\\nu\\bar \\nu)}\\approx \\frac{\\tilde g_{v\\mu e}^2g_{vee}^2}{m_v^4}/\\frac{g_w^4}{m_w^4}~.\\ ] ] since @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while @xmath32 , we can rewrite the last expression as @xmath33_{v-{\\rm exch . } } \\approx   \\frac{\\gamma(v\\to e^+e^-)\\gamma(v\\to \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp)}{\\gamma^2(w\\to e\\nu ) } \\left(\\frac{m_w}{m_v}\\right)^6~.\\ ] ] using br@xmath34 and other data pertaining to the @xmath17 widths of the various vector mesons @xmath13 , we find a set of bounds for the two - body lfv branching ratios of these vector bosons .",
    "these bounds are : @xmath35 likewise , the generic upper bounds on lfv tau decays br@xmath36 yields @xmath37 with @xmath38 . except for ( 11 ) , these inferred bounds are unlikely to be improved by future experimental data on two - body decays",
    ".    one can use similar considerations to obtain bounds on the lfv decays of pseudoscalar states . for these purposes",
    ", one considers instead of the @xmath0 process the @xmath39 decay , which has a lfv bound br@xmath40 . for this latter process the lfv couplings of the @xmath41 contribute , due to the exchange of these particles in the s - channel .",
    "we can again utilize this fact to infer upper bounds on @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 vertex , because of gauge invariance , involves two derivatives : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "this derivative coupling , in contrast to the @xmath46 non - derivative coupling encountered earlier , kinematically suppresses the off - shell @xmath47 contribution at @xmath48 relative to what it would be for on - shell @xmath41 decay .",
    "consequently the analog to eq .",
    "( 4 ) for the present case , @xmath49_{\\pi^o/\\eta^o-{\\rm exch.}}\\approx \\frac{\\gamma(\\pi^o/\\eta^o\\to\\gamma\\gamma ) \\cdot\\gamma(\\pi^o/\\eta^o\\to \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp)}{\\gamma^2(w\\to e\\nu ) } \\left(\\frac{m_w}{m_{\\pi^/\\eta}}\\right)^6\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\langle s_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\rangle}{m_{\\pi/\\eta}^2}\\right)^2~,\\ ] ] contains an extra factor @xmath50 which tends to weaken the bounds one can derive .",
    "one finds , for pseudoscalar lfv decays the bounds : @xmath51    in the discussion above we have obtained the quoted bounds purely by concentrating on the contribution of the exchanged state in question to the lfv process .",
    "one can imagine , however , additional lfv contributions .",
    "for example , for the @xmath39 decay , in addition to @xmath52 exchange in the @xmath25 channel , we have also the contribution of electron exchange in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 channels ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in this case",
    ", however , the stringent bound on the @xmath55 vertex coming from experiment [ br ( @xmath56 strongly suppresses these additional diagrams and causes negligible modifications to the bounds ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) . even in the absence of a strong bound on the @xmath55 coupling",
    ", we would like to note that cancellations between @xmath25 and @xmath53 channel contributions are in general expected to be at best rather partial .",
    "unless all particles , both external and exchanged , are spinless any specific @xmath25 channel amplitude will have different @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) dependence , and will contribute to different combinations of helicity amplitudes than the @xmath53 channel exchange contributions .    by the same token , it is clear that cancellations among different angular momentum states exchanged in the @xmath25 channel are also impossible .",
    "indeed , for example , the total decay rate for @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath59^{-1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   & & { } \\times\\sum_j ( 2j+1 ) |a^j_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}(s)|^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 the triangular function expressing the initial c.m .",
    "momentum in the @xmath25 channel , which here is that of @xmath61 or , equivalently , @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 are the partial waves in the jacob - wick expansion of the various @xmath25 channel helicity amplitudes .",
    "note that for the @xmath18 case , adding the @xmath53 channel amplitude amounts to enforcing the ( anti ) symmetrization between the @xmath64 and @xmath65 fermions . since fermi statistics does not preclude the vectorial coupling contributing to @xmath18 considered here [ c.f .",
    "( 2 ) ] , no cancellation of @xmath25 and @xmath53 contributions should arise as well .",
    "although we have called the bounds we obtained above unitarity bounds , in the strict sense the inferred bounds are not true unitarity bounds  as would be the case if the exchanged particle(s ) were on mass shell . to illustrate this point , let us recall a well known example of a true unitarity bound arising in rare kaon decays .",
    "this is the lower bound for the br@xmath66 derived from the measured branching ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 process , with an on - shell @xmath69 intermediate state , contributes to i m @xmath70 via unitarity since i m @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "this contribution provides a strict lower bound to the br@xmath66 , so the apparent violation of this bound in early @xmath73 data was a source for much concern .",
    "modern day data , as expected , agrees with this bound .",
    "@xcite    in the present context , an example of a  pure \" unitarity bound for a lfv process is provided by the  @xmath6 analog \" of the @xmath74 process . because the decay @xmath75 is kinematically forbidden , what one should consider instead is @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) .",
    "the  on - shell \" @xmath78 emitted in this putative process propagates over a long distance , of order @xmath79 fm , before decaying into @xmath80 in a manner which is completely independent of its production .",
    "this will generate a distinct narrow contribution to the corresponding three body processes @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , contributing to the imaginary part of these amplitudes at @xmath84 .",
    "hence , for example , there is an attendant lower bound on br@xmath85 $ ] which is simply br@xmath86 .",
    "the resulting rigorous upper bound one obtains , @xmath87 unfortunately happens to be rather weak .",
    "all the vector ( or pseudoscalars ) used as intermediaries in deriving the bounds in eqs ( 5)-(11 ) and eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) are not on - shell .",
    "thus we must entertain the possibility that their contribution to the three - body decays considered are reduced .",
    "this could void , or at least weaken the various strong bounds obtained above . in the rest of this note",
    "we will focus on possible mechanisms for such a reduction .",
    "the size of the boson exchange contribution to the three - body decay amplitude can be reduced if there are * kinematical * suppressions .",
    "these arise when the effective boson couplings are not minimal , involving derivatives ( or momentum factors ) .",
    "we already encountered one such case above , when we discussed the @xmath41 contribution to @xmath88 .",
    "we want to discuss here whether such kinematical suppressions may not also affect the vector exchange contributions .",
    "it is clearly possible to imagine that the lfv @xmath89 vertex , instead of having the form of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , involves an anomalous magnetic moment coupling : @xmath90 in this case the contribution of the virtual @xmath13 to @xmath18 is reduced by @xmath91 this would considerably weaken the bounds in eqs .",
    "( 6)-(8 ) and reduce the bound on @xmath24 decay to only br@xmath92 .    it does not seem likely to us , however , that the strong suppression factors appearing in eq .",
    "( 20 ) obtain in practice . indeed , various model calculation involving mixing among heavy neutrinos  @xcite lead to @xmath93 and effective @xmath94 flavor violating vertices , which involve non anomalous terms terms like the @xmath95 coupling of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and vectorial couplings like @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite hence we believe that the kinematic suppression given by eq .",
    "( 20 ) probably should not be included in our bounds .",
    "there is another possible source of suppression which needs to be considered .",
    "this is connected to possible `` form factor '' effects due to the * dynamics * which would , for example , reduce the contribution of the various @xmath13 states to @xmath18 compared to the naive expectations .",
    "however , the effect of form factors should be minimal or controllable if the lfv is induced by physics at scales much higher than the ew scale or the @xmath24 mass .",
    "the effects of dynamics are nicely illustrated in a recent paper by ilana , jack and riemann  @xcite .",
    "these authors find , in fact , an apparent mild enhancement when the @xmath97 process is induced by relatively light ( @xmath98 gev ) neutrinos . indeed , in this case the on - shell contribution of @xmath99 loops enhances the @xmath24 decay rates relative to the @xmath100 contribution by factors of 10 - 100 .",
    "however , such light active neutrinos would contribute to the @xmath14 width and are hence ruled out . thus such an ehancement is not physically expected . for light neutrinos i.e. neutrinos with masses in the ev range , as inferred from the superkamiokande  @xcite data",
    "are very much below our bounds ]    in terms of the dispersive approach adopted here , such a `` form factor '' suppression would result from cancellations in the corresponding partial wave amplitudes .",
    "consider , for example , the @xmath101 partial wave amplitude for the @xmath0 process :    @xmath102    to get a `` form factor '' suppression , there must be a cancellation between the contributions of the various @xmath103 particles among themselves , or between these contributions and those of the continuum .",
    "let us examine these possibilities .    for the case of quarkonium intermediate states",
    ", besides the lowest energy bound state there are towers of states of the same spin and parity . thus , for example , in eq.(21 ) besides the contribution of the @xmath104 one should also take into acount the exchange of the @xmath105 charmonium bound resonances .",
    "is it possible that these additional contributions largely cancel the @xmath106 term in eq .",
    "this is unlikely for the following reason . to get @xmath104 exchange to contribute to @xmath18 in the first place",
    ", one needs to assume that the lfv physics at a high scale induces an effective four - fermi coupling of the form : @xmath107 such a coupling underlies all the other charmonium contributions .",
    "in fact , quark - hadron duality identifies the @xmath108 contributions to @xmath0 as arising from specific portions of the @xmath109 integration region where due to non - perturbative qcd effects @xmath110 @xmath111 bound states dominate , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "3 . both the @xmath112 and @xmath113 couplings appearing in eq .",
    "( 21 ) are proportional to the wave function of @xmath114 at the origin , @xmath115 .",
    "thus all the terms in the sum share a common sign fixed by the sign of @xmath116 , with @xmath117 being the charge of the charm quark and cancellation can not occur .",
    "similar arguments apply against possible cancellations among the various states in the @xmath118 sector .",
    "the above discussion still leaves open the possibility of cancellations in the partial wave amplitude between different quarks - antiquark contributions ( @xmath119 ) or , equivalently , between the various resonant states ( @xmath120 . while possible this seems highly unlikely . for example , even if all the effective couplings @xmath121 were equal due to some universality , and the bubble kinematics were identical , the net contribution would not vanish since the total contribution would be proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , for the case of light quarks such cancellations can not work even in principle .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence for @xmath123 neglected above implies , for example , that a @xmath124 and @xmath78 contribution to the total decay rate cancel only at the level of @xmath125 .",
    "in general , lepton flavor violating processes have been analyzed within a specific theoretical framework . in this context , the restrictive role played by the low energy bounds ( @xmath126 conversion , etc . ) has been noted by many authors .",
    "@xcite  @xcite in this note instead we tried to present in a , relatively model - independent manner , the connections which unitarity implies between some two - body and three - body lfv decays .",
    "we have illustrated these connections by focusing on a few processes . clearly , many other bounds can be obtained . indeed , since the particle data group  @xcite lists altogether about one hundred lfv processes , many additional results can come from a more comprehensive analysis .",
    "we have noted that the bounds that we derived can be avoided if one can kinematically suppress the small @xmath25 contributions ( e.g. by having a purely anomalous magnetic @xmath127 coupling ) , or as a result of some ( rather unlikely ) cancellations . because we can not rule out these possibilities with absolute certainty",
    ", we hope that our discussion will not dissuade future efforts to improve the bounds on lfv decays of the @xmath128 .",
    "such decays would not only signal new lfv physics but , because of our considerations , this physics must also naturally give cancellations among terms so as to lead to a small @xmath18 branching ratio .",
    "thus searching for @xmath129 decays at levels considerably higher than our suggested bounds remains a worthwhile experimental challenge .",
