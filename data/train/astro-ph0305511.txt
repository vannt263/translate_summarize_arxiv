    "hot subdwarf stars as a class have effective temperatures exceeding @xmath020,000  k , with surface gravities higher and luminosities lower than main sequence stars of the same temperature .",
    "spectroscopically , hot subdwarfs are divided into two major subtypes : subdwarf  b ( sdb ) and subdwarf  o ( sdo ) .",
    "sdb stars have hydrogen - dominated atmospheres with @xmath130,000  k and exhibit a relatively small dispersion in luminosity @xcite .",
    "they often exhibit weak lines of helium , carbon , and other atomic species in comparison with population  i main sequence stars .",
    "sdo stars have helium - enriched atmospheres with @xmath2  k and exhibit a wider range of @xmath3 and luminosity than the sdb stars @xcite . hot subdwarf stars ( and sdb stars in particular ) are the primary source of the `` uv upturn '' ( or `` uvx '' ) seen in elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    based on their temperatures and magnitudes",
    ", @xcite proposed that the sdb stars are the field equivalent of @xcite population  ii b stars ( now known as `` extended horizontal branch , '' or `` ehb , '' stars ) which are seen in some globular cluster hr diagrams at the blue end of the horizontal branch .",
    "as such , sdb stars in the field are understood to be core helium burning objects with very low hydrogen envelope masses ( m@xmath4  @xmath5 ) and total masses of @xmath6  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "some sdo stars have colors and luminosities that are consistent with the hottest part of the ehb ( least massive h envelopes ) . however , there are a number of potential evolutionary paths , e.g.  post - agb evolution , that lead through the rather broad region of the hr diagram occupied by sdo stars .",
    "all hot subdwarfs , regardless of their prior evolution , are thought to be direct progenitors of white dwarfs , although they constitute only a small fraction of all stars that evolve to become white dwarfs .",
    "while the current evolutionary status of sdb stars is relatively well understood , how they actually arrived at the ehb with such low envelope masses is not understood .",
    "the spectroscopically inferred masses of field sdb stars have a very small dispersion .",
    "if they evolved directly from red giant progenitors , then their initial masses are constrained to be @xmath7  @xmath5 , leading to a requirement that they lose up to @xmath01.5  @xmath5 on the red giant branch before or right at core helium ignition @xcite .",
    "one scenario for such extreme mass loss suggests that sdb stars lost significant envelope mass due to binary interactions on the red giant branch @xcite .",
    "if this were the sole channel for forming sdb stars , _ all _ sdb stars would be expected to be found in _",
    "close _ binary systems  that is systems where the current separation is of the same order as the radius of the sdb progenitor star near the tip of the red giant branch , or r  @xmath8  r@xmath9  au @xcite .",
    "companions to sdb stars have been reported by numerous surveys , involving a variety of photometric and spectroscopic techniques , although these often have been of limited scope .",
    "these include : searches for flux excesses at long wavelengths , or flat energy distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; radial velocity variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the presence of a g - band , absorption , or other spectral features indicative of late type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and even direct high - resolution imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of these survey reports have included an attempt to deduce the fraction of sdbs that are in binaries .",
    "the results have ranged from 50 to 100% , depending on differing specific assumptions made about the nature and physical parameters of the sdb stars and/or their companions .",
    "for example , the evolutionary status of the companion stars is typically not known .",
    "some authors have preferred main sequence companions and less luminous sdb stars ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas others have preferred slightly evolved , sub - giant or giant companions and more luminous sdb stars ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correction for `` unseen '' fainter companions ( such as dm stars ) in determining the total binary fraction is greatly affected by this choice . thus ,",
    "if the observed ( g  k type ) companions in composite systems are subgiants , the number of fainter unobserved companions ( extrapolated using an assumed initial mass function ) must be very large , and the resulting binary fraction is close to 100% . on the other hand , if the g  k companions are main sequence stars , the number of fainter unobserved companions is much smaller ( because the lower inferred luminosity for the hot subdwarf is less effective at masking the light of such companions ) .",
    "the result is a binary fraction as low as 50% .",
    "however , only the radial velocity or imaging studies give information about whether the sdbs that do have companions are in _ close _ binary systems .",
    "the systematic survey of the entire sky that was carried out by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) provides the opportunity to further explore the question of whether all sdb stars ( and sdo stars , to the extent that they represent the ehb ) are in binary systems .",
    "this can be done by combining cataloged photometry at visible wavelengths with the 2mass near - infrared imaging photometry .",
    "in addition to comparing visible and near - ir magnitudes , near - infrared colors for hot subdwarfs ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) can be used on their own as a second indicator of a binary system . in this paper",
    "we collect readily available visible and near - ir flux measurements of hot subdwarfs and identify those whose colors indicate the presence of a late type companion .",
    "we thus determine the fraction of subdwarfs that exist in composite spectrum binaries .",
    "( note that not all classes of companion star will be identified this way , in particular white dwarf companions . )",
    "we extract visible photometry from an existing catalog of hot subdwarf stars , and we use ir photometry obtained from the 2mass second incremental data release ( 2idr ) catalog .",
    "we look for ir colors that are `` redder '' than what would be expected for a normal hot subdwarf and which can be attributed to the presence of an unresolved late type companion .",
    "this method is similar to that used by @xcite and @xcite , but our sample is much larger and the ir photometry is more precise .    in  [ sec : sample ]",
    "we describe our sample of hot subdwarfs including : improved coordinates , retrieval of 2mass infrared photometry , availability and sources of visual photometry , and adopted classifications for objects in the initial sample . in  [ sec : hotsdcolor ] we examine and model a magnitude limited sample of hot subdwarfs using two color diagrams and the distribution in @xmath10 color . in  [ sec : vol ] we introduce an approximately `` volume limited '' sample of hot subdwarfs and compare it to the magnitude limited sample . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our findings .",
    "for this investigation we studied hot subdwarf stars listed in the _ catalogue of spectroscopically identified hot subdwarfs _ @xcite as updated and expanded in an electronic version by kilkenny , c.1992 , kindly made available to us by d.  kilkenny .",
    "this catalog ( hereinafter referred to as khd ) contains 1527 entries , of which 302 entries were added since the 1988 publication .",
    "hot subdwarfs from the pg survey of uv - excess objects @xcite are an important component of the catalog ( 1017 objects with pg designations , either discovered or recovered by that survey ) .",
    "more recent or ongoing surveys , including the hamburg schmidt ( hs ) and edinburgh - cape ( ec ) surveys are not included . in the catalog sub - sample of 593 objects that is the subject of this paper , about 84% of the stars are to be found in the 1988 printed version of khd , and about half of the sub - sample stars added to khd between the 1988 and 1992 versions are from the carnegie southern observatory h&k survey @xcite .",
    "about 71% of the entries in khd have northern declinations , the same percentage as in the sub - sample studied here .",
    "the sub - sample is thus broadly representative of the parent catalog , for stars bright enough to be included in the 2mass point source database .",
    "a number of important selection effects bias the parent catalog s contents , however , since it is compiled from many different sources each with its own criteria for inclusion or discovery ( see also  [ sec : jks ] ) , but khd is the most complete single compilation of field hot subdwarfs available , especially for the northern sky and for relatively bright objects .    while the khd catalog contains all varieties of hot subdwarfs , we are primarily interested in the more numerous sdb stars . as mentioned above ,",
    "sdb stars are understood to be relatively homogeneous and probably have a common evolution history from the zero age extended horizontal branch ( zaehb ) and beyond , while sdo stars likely follow multiple evolutionary pathways and might be expected to be less homogeneous and to have less simply explained properties . in the following sections , while we focus on the sdb stars , we will take the sdo stars `` along for the ride '' and comment on the two groups either separately ( sdb or sdo ) , or combined as `` hot subdwarfs '' in general ( both sdb and sdo ) .",
    "we further discuss the adopted classifications of objects from khd and our treatment of them in  [ sec : class ] .      to make a comparison of the khd data with 2mass , accurate coordinates on a consistent system",
    "are required . for each entry we verified the object s position by referring whenever possible to original published finding charts or by contacting knowledgeable observers , then locating the object on a chart prepared from the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "we adopted coordinates from usno a2.0 , except for bright objects missing from that source , in which case we used coordinates from the tycho-2 @xcite or hipparcos @xcite catalogs .",
    "these updated icrs 2000.0 coordinates are accurate to a few arcseconds ( @xmath11 or better ) at the epoch of observation ; in many cases this represents a very substantial improvement over the coordinates reported by khd . during the time in which we collected the 2mass data ,",
    "we had confirmed and improved coordinates for 1459 objects ( not counting 11 duplicate entries ) , while for 57 objects we had not yet positively identified the correct star .",
    "these remaining 57 unrecovered objects are not included in the present study .",
    "the full collection of improved coordinates will be published elsewhere ( wade & stark , in preparation ) .",
    "infrared photometry ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) from the 2mass 2idr ( which covers @xmath045% of the sky ) was collected by performing searches within @xmath15 of the the updated coordinates .",
    "visual verification was performed for crowded fields by comparing images from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) with images from 2mass ( most hot subdwarfs are uncrowded , with no other comparably bright field stars within @xmath16 ) .",
    "objects are included in 2mass if they have photometric uncertainty @xmath17  mag ( signal - to - noise ratio , s / n@xmath187 ) in at least one of the three bands ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) .",

    "unfortunately , in order to use this technique , accurate visual photometry is needed in addition to ir photometry .      to test the interpretation offered above , that the colors of single and composite hot subdwarfs may be understood",
    "if the companions are cool stars , we attempted to reproduce the location of composite subdwarfs in color space by combining the colors of a typical sdb with those of late type pop  i main sequence stars .",
    "color indices for late type stars were taken from @xcite ; for this exercise we assumed @xmath82 .",
    "the `` typical '' colors for sdbs were taken from the center of the clump of reported single stars in figure  [ known ] .",
    "we used @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "based on the spread seen in figure  [ known ] , however , it is likely that single sdb stars in fact have spreads in color index on the order of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , as might be expected from variations in the physical properties of the sdbs ( most notably the effective temperature ) ; some of the spread in @xmath52 and @xmath10 is however due to limited ir photometric precision .",
    "the colors were combined , varying the fraction of the light at @xmath31 that arises from the companion .",
    "the resultant locus passes among the known composite sdbs with contributions from the companion of @xmath01060% at @xmath31 , and spectral types g  k ( figure  [ colortrack ] ) .",
    "these fractional contributions and companion types agree with those reported by @xcite for sdbs , and @xcite and @xcite for hot sdbs and sdos .",
    "while this general analysis also fits the sdos , the unreddened colors of a `` typical '' sdo should be somewhat bluer than those of a sdb , since sdos are hotter than sdbs .",
    "the loci are plotted with the entire subdwarf sample in figure  [ allcolortrack ] .    by introducing assumed absolute magnitudes along with colors , we can synthesize composite colors specifically for sdb+late type main sequence stars .",
    "we took colors and @xmath89 for pop  i main sequence stars from @xcite and @xcite and assumed colors and @xmath90 for the sdb component .",
    "the sdb colors used in the previous calculation were again adopted .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of sdb stars are poorly constrained , with reported values spanning the range from @xmath91 @xcite .",

    "we found that the locus of synthetic composites passes among the observed composite systems and best characterizes the observed companions as having pop  i spectral types g  k when @xmath93  mag ( if the companions lie on the main sequence ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the same pattern of color loci can be created by fixing @xmath90 and instead varying the absolute magnitudes of the companions from their main sequence values . if g ",

    "the ( main - sequence ) loci are plotted with the entire hot subdwarf sample in figure  [ allmscolortrack ] .",
    "these simple models give results consistent with previous studies concerning the companion spectral types and their light contributions .",
    "we can not , however , assume an @xmath89 for the companion and invert the calculation case - by - case to give reliable individual values for @xmath90 , nor _ vice versa _ , because of the uncertainties in the measured magnitudes , colors , and reddening .",
    "additionally there is the expected intrinsic spread in @xmath90 referred to above ( for further discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for similar reasons ,",
    "neither can we infer exact companion spectral types for individual objects .    of the 33 currently known composite hot subdwarf systems ,",
    "essentially all of the cool companion stars for which a spectral class is known are of spectral types g or k. our models show that composite systems with g , k , and early m - type companions show the most significant differences in color from a single sdb ( particularly in @xmath10 ) and from main sequence stars .",
    "this could explain why most _ known _ composite systems have gk - type companions : for companions earlier then @xmath0 g , the combined system looks more like a main sequence star ( or a cool , pop  ii subdwarf ) than a sdb star .",
    "such systems would likely be excluded from catalogs of hot subdwarfs . for main - sequence companions",
    "much later than @xmath0m0 , the effect on the combined system light is so small that the companion would not easily be detected in the visual .",
    "most of the spectroscopic studies of composite sdbs have been done in the visual and blue region of the spectrum where very little color difference between a composite sdb+dm and a single sdb exists , and there are indeed few identifications of dm companions  thus far there are only four known : pg  1241@xmath96 ( also hw  vir ; * ? ? ?",

    "a few other objects can be noted in the region of color space that , based on our simple models , would be occupied by sd+dm composites ( figures  [ allcolortrack ] and  [ allmscolortrack ] ) .",
    "owing to uncertainties in the measured magnitudes and colors , however , we can not clearly distinguish early m companions from late k companions  near - ir or ir spectroscopy will be needed to distinguish clearly between late k and early m - type companions .",
    "yet it seems clear , based on our color plots , that there are not great numbers of `` hidden '' early m - type ( @xmath0m0 ) companions to hot subdwarfs . for main sequence companions substantially later than @xmath0m0 , the @xmath10 color is rapidly returning to that of a single subdwarf .    identifying and characterizing further m - type companions to sdb stars would help settle some of the questions about the nature of earlier - type ( g  k ) companions , in particular whether they are predominately main sequence or subgiant stars .",
    "late m - type companions can safely be assumed to be on the main sequence .",
    "if many of these are found among the sdb stars with `` composite '' colors , the relatively faint @xmath90 inferred from such systems would imply that the g  k type companions in other composite - color systems are also close to the main sequence .",
    "if late - m companions are not found in great numbers , it could be inferred that the g ",
    "k companions are mostly subgiants , since the corresponding bright @xmath90 inferred from this assumption would explain the absence of sd+dm systems detectable from photometry",
    ". the existence of many subgiant companions , with their short lifetimes as subgiants , would be interesting , since the evolutionary timescale of sdb stars is also short .      since visual photometry is not available for all of the hot subdwarfs contained in the 2idr , and since there is a more distinct separation between composites and single subdwarfs stars in @xmath10 than in the other colors , we examined the distribution of subdwarfs based on their @xmath10 colors alone .",
    "a histogram of @xmath10 for all subdwarfs with @xmath12 and @xmath14 measurements ( 385 subdwarfs : 294 sdb , 91 sdo ) , reveals a bimodal distribution ( figure  [ jkhist ] ) .",
    "one peak is centered near @xmath107 ( @xmath0b2b3 spectral type ) , and the other is centered near @xmath108 ( @xmath0g5 spectral type ) .",
    "there are also wings stretching to both redder and bluer colors .",
    "this distribution can not be explained by reddening , because no significant trends were observed with galactic latitude .",
    "we would also expect reddening to produce a tail to the red from a single peak , but not a pronounced second peak . finally , the amount of extinction that would be required is also excessive .",
    "we sorted the sdb and sdo samples into three groups by @xmath12 magnitude .",
    "the bimodal peaks are very pronounced in the brightest third of each sample , less distinct in the middle third , and practically non - discernible in the faintest third .",
    "this pattern can be fully explained by the increase in photometric uncertainty at fainter magnitudes .    in keeping with the results found from our modeling of color  color distributions",
    ", we postulate that the stars within the blue peak of the @xmath10 distribution ( @xmath109 ) are single stars ( or sd+wd pairs , with colors indistinguishable from single hot subdwarfs ) , and that stars in the red peak ( @xmath110 ) are composite ( sd+late type ) systems .",
    "the color index separating these two groups of stars was adopted from the box defining the region of single subdwarfs in figure  [ known ] . with this definition",
    ", we find that 58@xmath1115% of the subdwarf stars in our 2mass 2idr sample are apparently single , and 42@xmath1115% are composite .",
    "the quoted 95% confidence errors are sampling errors computed from the binomial distribution , taking the size of the sample into account . if the color index of the boundary separating single and composites is increased ( decreased ) by 0.05 mag , the fraction of subdwarfs that are `` blue '' ( i.e. , single ) is increased ( decreased ) by 3% ( 3% ) .    while the 2idr sample is representative of the khd catalog as a whole , it is likely that neither of these is representative of the true hot subdwarf population in the solar neighborhood .",
    "there are the usual completeness issues , including heterogeneous magnitude limits and different classification criteria used by the sources from which khd was compiled ( although we note that about 2/3 of the cataloged subdwarfs are drawn from the pg survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* which has rather well - defined properties ) .",
    "we draw renewed attention , however , to a kind of censorship bias that is present in the pg survey .",
    "an unknown number of composite subdwarfs may have been excluded `` by design '' ( i.e. , not included in the pg catalog and never identified as hot subdwarfs ) , since according to @xcite uv excess stars were omitted from their catalog if their spectra showed a pronounced  k line .",
    "( the supposition was that many of these would be metal - weak f or g subdwarfs , which met the purely photometric criterion for inclusion as uv excess stars owing to a combination of reduced line blanketing and larger than average photometric errors . )",
    "thus composite hot subdwarf systems with f or g companions might be _ underrepresented _ in khd and the present sub - sample drawn from it .",
    "( on the other hand , since some pg subdwarfs are found in other independent surveys , some of the composite systems `` missing '' from pg may nevertheless have been included in the khd compilation , from other sources . )",
    "the number of `` excluded '' objects is roughly 10001200 ( r.  f.  green 2003 , private communication ) , but the fraction of these that may be composite hot subdwarfs rather than g subdwarfs is not known , so these selection effects are difficult to quantify . in time , objective prism - based surveys such as the one being carried out with the hamburg schmidt telescope may provide a catalog of hot subdwarfs that is more clearly representative of the galactic population .",
    "meanwhile , we proceed to analyze the 2mass 2idr sample from the khd catalog .",
    "it must be realized , however , that since the 2mass 2idr represents a magnitude limited survey , the composite systems ( being more luminous than single subdwarfs ) will be _ overrepresented _ in this sample , other things being equal ( see  [ sec : vol ] for further discussion of this point ) .",
    "the same bimodal distribution in @xmath10 exists in the sub - sample of sdb / sd stars that is found in the full sample ( 58@xmath1116% have @xmath109 , and 42@xmath1116% have @xmath110 ) .",
    "the sub - sample of sdo / sdob stars shows a less clear pattern . there is a hint of three groups : one near @xmath112 , another near @xmath113 , and the third near @xmath114 , but the small number of stars in each group makes this finding quite tentative",
    "the two larger groups of sdo stars ( @xmath112 and + 0.2 ) , if real , can be considered to fall to the `` blue '' side ( lower @xmath10 ) of the the two peaks in the sdb distribution , consistent with the higher temperatures of the sdo with respect to the sdb stars .",
    "overall , the observed bimodal distribution in @xmath10 of all hot subdwarfs is defined by the majority sdb stars .",
    "the fraction in each peak of the @xmath10 distribution does not significantly change if the sdo stars are removed .",
    "a breakdown of the fractions of subdwarfs by @xmath10 color is shown in table  [ fractions ] .",
    "we have fitted the bimodal @xmath10 distribution of the sdb stars ( alone ) to the sum of two gaussians , centered on the blue and red peaks .",
    "an initial `` fit - by - eye '' to the binned data was improved by minimizing @xmath115 on a range that was trimmed ( @xmath116 ) to remove the effects of the reddest and bluest outliers .",
    "the @xmath115 minimization was done using a systematic gridded search in the neighborhood of the initial fit .",
    "there are six fitting parameters : two mean values ( or centers ) , two dispersions ( or widths ) , and two normalizations ( or amplitudes ) .",
    "the final fit has @xmath117 ( reduced @xmath118 , with 15 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the parameters for the fit are listed in table  [ gaussparameters ] and the fit is shown in figure  [ gaussall ] .",
    "while the @xmath115 statistic provides a useful criterion for improving the fit , its final numerical value should be used with caution , since the range of the fit was trimmed , and since some of the data bins contain only a few members . in particular , the 95% confidence intervals shown in table  [ gaussparameters ] are indicative rather than definitive .",
    "the small value of @xmath119 nevertheless demonstrates the plausibility of a two - gaussian fit , which is confirmed by visual inspection .",
    "the `` blue '' gaussian has a somewhat smaller gaussian dispersion than the red one , but both dispersions ( @xmath120 , 0.16 ) are close to the average photometric error for this sample from 2mass , @xmath121 .",
    "this makes it difficult to state whether there is any intrinsic spread in the @xmath10 colors of the single or composite sdbs .",
    "to the extent that the separation of single and composite sdb stars in the sample is accurately represented by two gaussians , it is seen that there is very little overlap in @xmath10 color index between the two groups of stars .",
    "the areas of the two gaussians are in the proportion 57:43 , consistent with the binomial result found using a sharp demarcation at @xmath122 .",
    "there is a strong advantage in working with the @xmath10 color index to discuss the fraction of composite - color binaries among hot subdwarfs , as in  [ sec : jks ] and [ sec : gauss ] above , since the data are available for a larger sample than would be the case for optical or mixed optical - infrared colors .",
    "also , the @xmath12 and @xmath14 from 2mass are homogeneous in nature . however , a strong selection bias in these data exists , because 2mass itself is an approximately _ magnitude _ limited survey ( albeit with different magnitude limits in each of three passbands ) .",
    "the entire sample of hot subdwarfs we have been discussing ( common to both khd and 2mass 2idr ) is thus a _ magnitude _ limited sample in some sense .",
    "the _ volume _ sampled for single subdwarfs is therefore smaller than that sampled for composites , since the presence of the late type companion increases the distance at which a composite system remains brighter than the limiting 2mass magnitude .    to further explore this selection bias , we constructed ( @xmath12 , @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath14 , @xmath10 ) color - magnitude diagrams for the full 2mass 2idr sample ( figure  [ volcut ] ) .",
    "several interesting patterns are noted .",
    "first , the two populations ( single and composite ) can be seen , and both are observed to cover the entire magnitude range ( i.e. , composites and/or singles are not `` clumped '' at a specific apparent magnitude ) .",
    "second , a majority of the objects with extreme @xmath10 colors ( either blue or red ) are found at the faintest magnitudes , an effect largely explained by photometric errors .",
    "third , it can be seen that the sample is limited by detections in the @xmath14 band .",
    "there is a clear cut - off at @xmath123 , while in @xmath12 the cut - off magnitude varies by color ( redder objects that are detected in _ both _ @xmath12 and @xmath14 run to a fainter @xmath12 magnitude than the bluer objects ) .",
    "the interpretation of this third feature is that a blue ( single ) object detected near @xmath124 or fainter is missing at @xmath14 and thus is not part of the plotted sample ; a red ( composite ) object at the same @xmath12 will also have a @xmath14 detection and thus will appear in figure  [ volcut ] .",
    "( this effect is distinct from the fact that composites appear brighter at @xmath12 due to the combined light from two stars . )    recognizing this selection bias , we can attempt to define an approximately _ volume _ limited sample of hot subdwarfs .",
    "( to our knowledge , this is the first time that this bias has been discussed in the context of hot subdwarf composites .",
    "@xcite discussed a `` statistically complete '' sample containing 11 hot subdwarfs , however they did not address the composite vs.  single bias . ) to define our volume limited sample , we try to remove those subdwarfs that we observe to be composite , but which would _ not _ have been detected by 2mass had they been single . with only a single color index to work with , and with uncertainties in both the photometry and the relative luminosities of the hot subdwarfs and their companions , we can not rely on such a technique to say whether any given individual system lies within the defined volume .",
    "the sample so constructed can be used in a statistical sense , however , to reflect the general nature of the true distribution , and at least to indicate the size of the selection effect .    the observed cut - off magnitude from figure  [ volcut ] for a single hot subdwarf",
    "is @xmath123 . taking this limit as the apparent magnitude of the hot subdwarf component in a composite system , we can compute the corresponding apparent magnitude for the total light from the system , using the models discussed in  [ sec : model ] and shown in figures  [ colortrack ] and  [ allcolortrack ] .",
    "this total magnitude will vary as the spectral type and/or relative luminosity of the late type companion is varied .",
    "the locus of thus - computed magnitudes is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ volcut ] for a hot subdwarf with the `` typical '' color @xmath125 adopted in  [ sec : model ] , for companions with colors of the pop  i main sequence spectral types g0 , k0 , k5 , and m0 . along each of these lines ,",
    "the color and total magnitude varies as the relative brightnesses of the two component stars are varied .",
    "note that _ no assumption has been made about the absolute magnitude of either the hot subdwarf or the cool companion .",
    "_    we now replace the family of lines ( corresponding to different spectral types of the cool star ) with a single representative line .",
    "( this is because based on @xmath10 alone we can not know the true spectral types of the late type companions without making assumptions about the relative luminosities of the component stars . )",
    "we use this line to approximate the appropriate magnitude limit for a volume limited sample , again in a _",
    "statistical _ sense .",
    "the line is chosen to pass though the middle of the known composite sdbs shown in figure  [ colortrack ] ; it thus represents a @xmath126%  contribution ( at @xmath31 ) by a k5 star , or a contribution of 4080% at k0 in figure  [ volcut ] .",
    "the change in the volume - limiting @xmath14 magnitude is thus most rapid near @xmath127 ( see figure  [ colortrack ] ) .",
    "all hot subdwarf stars in the ( @xmath14 , @xmath10 ) color - magnitude diagram that fall above this line are included in our statistical volume limited sample .",
    "the resulting sample size is 300 hot subdwarfs ( 228 sdb and 72 sdo ) .",
    "the average error in @xmath10 for this new sample is 0.10 mag ( slightly reduced from 0.12 mag , which applies to the full @xmath10 sample ) .      for the volume limited sample , visual magnitudes ( _ bv _ or the _ uvby _ equivalent ) are available for 176 sdb stars ( 4 additional with @xmath31 only ) and 61 sdo stars ( 1 additional with @xmath31 only ) .",
    "the volume limited sample occupies the same regions of ( @xmath10 , ) and ( @xmath10 , @xmath52 ) color spaces ( figure  [ trimmedcolor ] ) that the magnitude limited sample does ( compare figures  [ allsdb ] and  [ trimmedcolor ] ) , but many of the more extreme red objects ( in @xmath10 ) have been removed .",
    "the @xmath10 histogram made using only the volume limited sample ( figure  [ volhist ] ) can be compared with the corresponding diagram for the entire magnitude limited sample ( figure  [ jkhist ] ) .",
    "the distribution is still bimodal , with one peak centered near @xmath107 as before ( @xmath0b2b3 spectral type ) , and the other near @xmath108 ( @xmath0g5 spectral type ) .",
    "the sdb stars still dominate the total hot subdwarf distribution , and the sdo stars show a stronger hint of bimodality ( again with both peaks shifted slightly blueward of the sdb peaks ) .",
    "the blue wing to the distribution remains , while the red wing has been greatly reduced .",
    "most important , the fractions of single ( `` blue '' ) and composite ( `` red '' ) systems have been altered ( table  [ volfractions ] ) . whereas the magnitude limited sample showed a 58:42 split between single and composite sdb stars ( table  [ fractions ] ) , the volume limited sample shows a 75:25 split in favor of single sdb stars .",
    "likewise , the split for the total hot subdwarf sample is 73:27 in the volume limited sample ( as opposed to 58:42 in the magnitude limited sample ) .",
    "we can again describe the sdb @xmath10 distribution for the volume limited sample as the sum of two gaussians .",
    "the new @xmath128 ( reduced @xmath129 , with 15 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the parameters for the fit are given in table  [ volgaussparameters ] , and the fit is shown in figure  [ gauss ] .",
    "the parameters of the blue gaussian fits for the magnitude limited and volume limited samples are essentially the same .",
    "this follows because the number of stars that fall in the blue peak was not substantially altered in creating the volume limited sample .",
    "the width of the blue gaussian is consistent with the average photometric error from 2mass for this sample , @xmath130 , implying that there is little intrinsic spread in the @xmath10 color index of single sdb stars .",
    "the red gaussians for the magnitude limited and volume limited samples have different mean values ( centers ) , with the volume limited sample shifted blueward relative to the magnitude limited sample [ @xmath131 .",
    "the normalizations ( amplitudes ) are different , owing to to the decrease in the number of red stars in the volume limited sample .",
    "the change in center is likely due to the removal of the reddest and also the faintest ( and thus most uncertain ) measurements from the red peak .",
    "the dispersion of the red gaussian that represents the volume limited sample , @xmath132 , is reduced from the magnitude limited case , and is now consistent with the 2mass photometric error for this new sample ( @xmath133 mag ) ; this implies that there is little variation in the @xmath10 color of the remaining composite systems .",
    "using updated and improved coordinates for hot subdwarfs cataloged by khd , we have retrieved 2mass 2idr photometry for 571 hot subdwarfs .",
    "this is the largest sample of hot subdwarfs , and in particular composite systems , ever examined .",
    "we divided the sample into two sub - samples based on their classifications in khd : sdb / sd ( `` sdb '' group ) , sdo / sdob ( `` sdo '' group ) .",
    "we examined these two sub - samples both independently and combined as a whole .",
    "we examined the distribution of hot subdwarfs in optical - ir color - color plots , by combining 2mass with visual photometry ( _ bv _ or _ uvby _ ) from khd ( or a few selected other sources ) .",
    "the most revealing combinations of color indices we found were : ( @xmath10 , ) and ( @xmath10 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "we also examined the distribution of hot subdwarfs in @xmath10 only and found a bimodally distributed population .",
    "finally , we attempted to define an approximately volume limited sample of hot subdwarfs for statistical purposes .",
    "this is the first time ( to our knowledge ) , that the selection bias favoring composite hot subdwarfs in magnitude limited surveys has been discussed , and an approximately volume limited statistical sample defined .    in keeping with the exploratory nature of this work and the large sample size ,",
    "we have favored a statistical approach , in contrast to the attempt to find a best characterization of individual binaries .",
    "( the relatively large mean errors of the 2mass photometry also figured in the decision to use this approach . ) in the same spirit , we have contented ourselves with `` naive '' modeling of the colors , e.g. , adopting single values for the colors and magnitudes of the subdwarfs rather than a distribution of these quantities  our goal in the modeling is to support the overall division of the sample of stars into single and composite groups , by demonstrating the plausibility of such modeling .",
    "we found that the locations of hot subdwarfs in visual - ir color - color diagrams can be modeled ( very simply and without assuming luminosities for either the hot subdwarf or the companion ) as either a single b - type star or as a combination of two stars ( spectral type b representing the hot subdwarf , and spectral type g ",
    "k for a companion ) with contributions from the late type companion of @xmath134% at @xmath31 . to a first approximation sdo stars can be described in the same manner as sdb stars .",
    "if main sequence companions are adopted , then the sdb stars are best described with @xmath135  mag , and they typically have g  k type companions .",
    "however , the observed distribution can be reproduced equally well by assuming subgiant companions with more luminous sdb stars ( @xmath136  mag )  our current data can not distinguish between these two possibilities . in a histogram of the ir color index @xmath10",

    "spectroscopy of the ir triplet region of 40 sdb stars , and an assumed `` typical '' luminosity of a sdb star , @xcite claim that the seven composite systems they observed contained subgiant companions .",
    "therefore they conclude that the the binary fraction must be much higher than what @xcite concluded based on assuming main sequence companions . from a sample of 40",
    "uv selected hot subdwarfs , @xcite found that eight showed composite spectra , and calculated that 65100% of hot subdwarfs had a late type main sequence companion .",
    "however , our volume limited sample shows significantly fewer composites then our magnitude limited sample .",
    "thus , by studying only magnitude limited samples ( or even less well - defined samples ) of hot subdwarfs , it is conceivable that the total number of composite systems could have been significantly over - estimated by these previous surveys ( all other factors being equal ) .",
