    "in this paper we are going to prove certain relations concerning yangian for @xmath3 which has been formulated in @xcite and to consider thoroughly corresponding numerical @xmath4-matrix defining yangian for @xmath5 .",

    "consider operators @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a spectral parameter .",
    "we say that @xmath6 is the symmetry algebra of the operator @xmath12 if @xmath13 we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are unit operators in @xmath9 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "there is an efficient procedure which enables us to construct nontrivial solutions of cubic yang - baxter equations ( [ rrr ] ) starting with the known one .",
    "the procedure can be illustrated by the following sequence of specializations in the yang - baxter relations ( [ rrr ] ) : @xmath21 and corresponding sequence of solutions @xmath22 indeed , one starts with the simplest known solution @xmath23 of the yang - baxter equation ( [ rrr ] ) defined in the space @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the space of the simplest faithful representation , e.g. _ defining _ representation for the matrix lie algebra @xmath6 .",

    "one solves yang - baxter relation ( [ rrr ] ) restricted to the space @xmath29 and obtains @xmath30 .",
    "there is a well known argumentation ( based on the associativity ideas ) why @xmath30 respects yang - baxter equation ( [ rrr ] ) defined in the space @xmath31 .",

    "the geometrical picture is the following .",
    "the second equation in ( [ system ] ) defines the family of curves parameterized by @xmath212 in the plane @xmath213 .",
    "thus , it is possible to introduce new coordinates @xmath214 in the plane where @xmath215 is a coordinate on the curve specified by @xmath212 .",
    "the variable @xmath215 is a coordinate on @xmath208 as well .",
    "then due to the first equation in ( [ system ] ) the coordinate @xmath193 is determined by @xmath216 and @xmath213 or equivalently by @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the transformation @xmath218 is equivalent to the change of coordinates @xmath219 on the curve @xmath208 .",

    "we note that the local yang - baxter equations were introduced in @xcite and applied to the investigations of 3d integrable systems in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in order to prove crucial properties of the spinorial @xmath4-matrix ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) we need to transform it to a more appropriate form . in subsection [ secrint ]",
    "we rewrite spinorial @xmath4-matrix in fermionic realization ( [ r ] ) as an integral over auxiliary parameter ( u ) = ^_0 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are two arbitrary functions related with @xmath114 and @xmath115 appearing in ( [ revenodd ] ) .",
    "representation ( [ rint ] ) happens to be very helpful since it enables to avoid multiple summations over repeated indices in ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) .",
    "moreover the finite summation over @xmath53 in ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) is substituted by an integral over auxiliary parameter .",
    "thus the yang - baxter equation ( [ yb ] ) which would assert equality of the two cumbersome multiple sums if we use representation ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) , turns into an equality of two integrals . using representation ( [ rint ] ) we check directly that the yang - baxter equation ( [ yb ] ) is satisfied .",
    "more concretely we show that the equation is equivalent to the symmetry of a certain integral taken over the space of auxiliary parameters .",
    "previously we have shown that gamma - matrix structure of spinorial @xmath4-matrix ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) can be simplified considerably using fermionic realization ( [ r ] ) .",
    "now we are going to make one more step rewriting the function @xmath172 in ( [ r ] ) that contains all information about coefficient functions @xmath73 .",
    "let us remind that coefficient functions respect recurrence relations ( [ recurr ] ) .",
    "above we have already found their solutions ( [ revenodd ] ) containing two arbitrary functions of spectral parameter . using this freedom coefficient functions",
    "can be expressed in terms of euler beta function @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are arbitrary functions of spectral parameter .",
    "then we separate even and odd terms in ( [ rfun ] ) @xmath228 take into account @xmath229 , resort to integral representation of the @xmath91-function @xmath230 @xmath231 and sum up the series obtaining ( u|y ) = ^_0 .",
    "thus we have managed to substitute finite set of coefficient functions appearing in ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) by the integral over auxiliary parameter . finally , applying ( [ r ] ) we deduce the desired form ( [ rint ] ) of the spinorial @xmath4-matrix claimed above . in ( [ decomp1 ] )",
    "we indicated natural decomposition of the spinorial @xmath4-matrix in the sum of even @xmath102 and odd @xmath103 parts ( [ rpm ] ) .",
    "the formulae ( [ rint ] ) and ( [ rfun ] ) imply the second natural decomposition ( u ) = a(u ) ^+(u ) + b(u ) ^-(u ) = a(u ) ^+(u ) + b(u ) ^-(u ) where ^+(u ) ^_0 ( e^x _ 1_2 ) , ^-(u ) ^_0 ( e^-x _ 1_2 ) , and @xmath232 .",
    "now we are ready to establish the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb ] ) .",
    "more exactly we will prove at first the yang - baxter relation for spinorial @xmath4-matrix in fermionic realization .",
    "its tensor product structure has been already discussed in subsection [ ybstr ] . to be more precise corresponding generating function for its right hand side ( [ ybrhsgen ] ) and left hand side ( [ yblhsgen ] )",
    "have been indicated . then in the previous subsection",
    "we have found out that coefficient functions of the spinorial @xmath4-matrix can be arranged in a sole function ( [ rfun ] ) .",
    "further let us note that the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb ] ) in fermionic realization is equivalent to the set of eight three - term relations for @xmath233 ( [ r1r2 ] ) @xmath234 where @xmath235 since @xmath223 and @xmath224 in the expression of spinorial @xmath4-matrix ( [ decomp2 ] ) are arbitrary functions . at first",
    "the yang - baxter relation will be proven for @xmath236 .",
    "taking into account ( [ ybrhsgen ] ) , ( [ yblhsgen ] ) and ( [ rfun ] ) one can easily see that the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb2 ] ) at @xmath237 is equivalent to = where ^u , v(a , b , c ) _ d e^a + b + c , the integration domain @xmath238 . instead of verifying ( [ ybasym ] )",
    "we are going to check more general relation ^u , v(a , b , c ) = ^u , v(c , b , a ) where the left and right hand sides to be understood as formal power series in @xmath239 which are unspecified commuting external parameters . the discrete symmetry ( [ ii ] ) of the integral ( [ i ] ) will be established by means of the integration variable change @xmath218 defined by the local yang - baxter equation ( [ nl - yb ] ) which leads to the system of relations ( [ sys ] ) .",
    "one can easily see that under this transformation of variables the external parameters @xmath240 and @xmath241 are interchanged in the exponential factor in ( [ i ] ) .",
    "however it is rather nontrivial that the other factors in the integrand transform in the right way such that ( [ ii ] ) is satisfied .    to see it we appeal to geometric interpretation of the transformation ( [ sys ] ) which have been discussed in section [ nonloc - yb ] , where we proposed to change variables @xmath242 according to ( [ vch ] ) . in this case",
    "the integration domain @xmath243 can be represented as @xmath244 , where @xmath208 is a curve parameterized by @xmath212 and @xmath216 .",
    "after all we make in ( [ i ] ) the natural change of integration variables @xmath245 , presented in ( [ vch ] ) , for which the jacobian determinant has a rather simple form @xmath246    the formulae ( [ vch ] ) map domain @xmath243 onto disconnected domain @xmath247 g = \\{(a , b , t ) : a1 , b0 } \\{(a , b , t ) : a-1 , b 0 } that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] .",
    "after a simple calculation one obtains ^u , v(a , b , c ) = _ g. since the integral ( [ i ] ) is rewritten in the form ( [ itab ] ) it is straightforward to prove the symmetry ( [ ii ] ) applying the integration variable change @xmath248 where @xmath249 .",
    "it corresponds to the transposition @xmath250 in ( [ itab ] ) . indeed the integrand in ( [ itab ] ) transforms correctly and the integration domain @xmath247",
    "is mapped onto itself .",
    "thus the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb2 ] ) at @xmath251 is established . in a similar way",
    "the rest seven three - term relations ( [ yb2 ] ) can be checked . to realize it we note that expressions ( [ r1r2 ] ) for @xmath252 and @xmath253 are almost identical .",
    "they can be obtained from each other reflecting the integration variable @xmath254 . in other words @xmath252 and @xmath253 differ solely in integration contour . in the first case one",
    "integrates over positive semiaxis and in the second case over negative one . consequently to check one of the three - term relations ( [ yb2 ] ) we have to consider the integral ( [ i ] ) taken over appropriate reflected domain @xmath243 .",
    "for example at @xmath255 we integrate over @xmath256 in ( [ i ] ) .",
    "when the variable change ( [ vch ] ) is performed , it leads to the integral ( [ itab ] ) with a certain integration domain that can be found in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the symmetry ( [ ii ] ) is established as before by means of the variable change @xmath250 in ( [ itab ] ) which preserves the integration domain as one can easily see .",
    "let us stress that algebraic manipulations needed to prove the three - term relations ( [ yb2 ] ) are the same in all eight cases .",
    "the only difference is in the integration domains in ( [ i ] ) or ( [ itab ] ) .",
    "finally , we have checked eight three - term relations ( [ yb2 ] ) and hence we have proved the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb ] ) for spinorial @xmath4-matrix in fermionic realization . using decomposition ( [ decomp2 ] ) of the @xmath4-matrix in the sum of even and odd parts",
    "we obtain eight three - term @xmath257 where @xmath258 ( compare with ( [ prop2 ] ) ) .",
    "however let us emphasize that we have always used above the fermionic representation for the @xmath4-matrix . at the end of subsection  [ rules ]",
    "we have shown how to represent fermionic operators ( [ r ] ) in the matrix form ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that three - term relations ( [ ybe+-2 ] ) remain valid in both matrix representation @xmath173 and @xmath259 ( [ rep - gam ] ) .",
    "thus the yang - baxter relation ( [ yb ] ) for spinorial @xmath4-matrix ( [ r - mtr01 ] ) is checked .      in the introduction we have formulated unitarity relations ( [ unitarity ] ) and proven them up to explicit calculation of coefficient functions @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
