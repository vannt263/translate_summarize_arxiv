    "consider a two - dimensional quantum field theory @xmath3 which is defined on oriented surfaces with metric , and which allows for the presence of line defects .",
    "we will be interested in topological line defects , that is , line defects that can be deformed on the surface without changing the amplitude which @xmath3 assigns to the surface .",
    "line defects can meet in junction points , and also here we will be interested only in topological junctions . altogether , the qft @xmath3 assigns amplitudes to surfaces with defect networks , and these amplitudes are invariant under deformations which move the defect lines and junctions without generating new intersections .",
    "we will briefly review this framework in section [ sec : def - qft ] .    in this paper",
    "we show how given a topological line defect of the qft @xmath3 , together with 1- and 3-valent topological junctions for this defect  all subject to conditions we list below  one can construct a new qft @xmath4 which is defined on surfaces with metric and with spin structure .    quite generally , to construct new @xmath5-dimensional qfts from a given @xmath5-dimensional qft , one can try to implement the following idea :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ carry out a state sum construction of an @xmath5-dimensional topological field theory inside an @xmath5-dimensional qft with defects .",

    "this idea generalises the state sum construction of topological field theories in the sense that the latter can be thought of as being internal to the trivial qft .",
    "so far the above idea has been applied only in two dimensions , and we will describe this case in more detail now .    the topological line defects and topological junctions of an oriented two - dimensional qft @xmath3 form a @xmath7-linear monoidal category @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the objects in @xmath8 are the possible line defects , the tensor product amounts to fusion of line defects , and the morphisms are given by junctions .",
    "since junctions can be thought of as fields inserted at the point were the defect lines meet , they form a @xmath7-vector space .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 has two - sided duals ( given by orientation reversal of the defect line ) and is pivotal .",
    "the category @xmath8 contains much interesting information about the qft @xmath3 .",
    "for example , given a @xmath0-separable symmetric frobenius algebra @xmath9 in @xmath8 ( we will explain these notions in the table below ) , one can construct a new qft @xmath10 , the _ orbifold of @xmath3 by @xmath9 _ , which is again defined on oriented surfaces with metric @xcite .",
    "this amounts to applying the above idea to the state sum construction of oriented two - dimensional topological field theories @xcite .",
    "the name `` orbifold '' is justified since the construction of @xmath10 reduces to the standard orbifold construction if @xmath9 comes from a group symmetry of @xmath3 .",
    "but there are @xmath9 s which do not come from group symmetries ( e.g.  the exceptional cases in @xcite ) , so in this sense @xmath10 could be called a generalised orbifold .",
    "another example is given by the main result of this paper : a @xmath0-separable frobenius algebra @xmath11 whose nakayama automorphism ( see table below ) squares to the identity allows one to define a qft @xmath4 on spin surfaces starting from the qft @xmath3 , which was defined on oriented surfaces with defects .",
    "this is again an instance of the above idea , applied now to the state sum construction of 2d spin tfts given in @xcite .",
    "let us describe the resulting construction in more detail .    to evaluate @xmath4 on a spin surface @xmath12 , one first encodes the spin structure in terms of    * a triangulation of the underlying oriented surface @xmath13 , * a choice of an orientation for each edge of the triangulation and of a preferred edge for each triangle ( a _ marking _ ) , * a sign @xmath14 for each edge ( the _ edge signs _ ) .",
    "this combinatorial model for spin structures was introduced in @xcite and will be reviewed in section [ sec : spin - comb ] .",
    "other closely related combinatorial models can be found in @xcite .",
    "an extension of the work in @xcite to @xmath15-spin surfaces can be found in @xcite .",
    "next , one places a network of line defects @xmath9 and junctions labelled by the structure maps of the frobenius algebra on the graph dual to the triangulation .",
    "the precise type of the junctions depends on the marking and the edge signs .",
    "the amplitude @xmath16 is defined as the amplitude that @xmath3 assigns to @xmath13 with the above defect network .",
    "this is described in detail in section [ sec : amp - spin - def ] .",
    "frobenius algebras as above also appear in another state sum construction of two - dimensional spin topological field theory in @xcite and in the description of `` generalised twisted sectors '' in orbifolds in @xcite ( there without restriction on the order of the nakayama automorphism ) .",

    "in fact , the study of rational cfts on spin surfaces is one of the main motivations for us to develop the present formalism .",
    "let us have a closer look at this case , which we also discuss in detail in section [ sec : rcft ] .    fix a vertex operator algebra @xmath40 with the property that its category of representations , @xmath41 , is a modular tensor category .",

    "in the free fermion examples which we investigate in sections [ sec:1ff - ex ] and [ sec : so(n ) ] , it turns out that instead of the cft on its own , one should consider the product of the cft with the trivial 2dtft that takes values in super vector spaces ( see section [ sec : qxsv ] ) .",
    "the relevant category of topological defects is then @xmath42 , and it is this category in which we need to find @xmath0-separable frobenius algebras whose nakayama automorphism squares to the identity .",
    "there are many questions still unanswered in the present paper .",
    "for example , in the context of rational cfts : can every 2d spin cft be obtained from a suitable oriented cft in this way ? can one explicitly classify all @xmath0-separable frobenius algebras @xmath9 with @xmath43 ( or suitable morita classes thereof ) in @xmath42 in interesting examples ? for supersymmetric cfts , what characterises those @xmath9 which give world sheet and/or spacetime supersymmetric theories ?",
