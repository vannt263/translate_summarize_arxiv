    "atomic nucleus is a self - binding finite quantum many - body system whose size is several femtometers (= fm = 10@xmath1 m ) .",
    "it is composed of two kinds of fermions ( protons and neutrons ) with spin @xmath2 that are called `` nucleons '' .",
    "the number of nucleons in a nucleus is a few hundreds at most .",
    "there are about 3,000 nuclei observed in experiments , and yet more to be discovered . in order to study the structure of nuclei",
    ", we investigate many excited modes of many nuclei . to study nuclear collision microscopically is also very important .",
    "nucleus has `` magic numbers '' , which are analogous to those in atoms .",
    "this suggests that the nucleon in the nucleus is freely moving in an attractive average potential .",
    "the nucleons create the mean field by themselves .    in the time - dependent mean - field theory ,",
    "the heavy - ion collision is expressed as colliding of two mean fields .",
    "we should investigate the behavior of single - particle states while colliding two fields , to expect the structure of nuclei after the heavy - ion collision .",
    "nuclear pairing correlation has a significant role to define single - particle states .",
    "it allows the fractional occupation probability of single - particle states due to the pair scattering , which is important to reconstruct a new mean field .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock theory ( tdhf ) is well - known as a useful tool to study nuclear dynamics@xcite , however it can not include effects of pairing correlation .",
    "there is a theory to treat pairing correlation in nuclear dynamics self - consistently , which is called the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ( tdhfb ) .",
    "but , there is no study of heavy ion collision using tdhfb with a modern effective interaction in three - dimensional space , because the study is hard to prepare converged initial state , and it needs the huge computational resource@xcite .",
    "we proposed a new td mean - field theory to study nuclear dynamics treating pairing , which is named the canonical - basis tdhfb ( cb - tdhfb)@xcite .",
    "the cb - tdhfb is derived from full tdhfb equations represented in canonical basis which diagonalizes density matrix , with bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-like approximation for pairing functional ( @xmath3,@xmath4-channel ) .",
    "we confirmed that linear response calculations of the cb - tdhfb are a good approximation of the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) which is a small amplitude limit of tdhfb@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we apply the cb - tdhfb to heavy ion collision in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinate space using a modern effective interaction ( skyrme : skm@xmath5 ) with a contact pairing . in the followings ,",
    "we introduce the cb - tdhfb equations and the contact pairing functional .",
    "then , we show results of @xmath0o+@xmath0o which indicate an collision of the gap - energy .",
    "the cb - tdhfb equations can be derived from the tdhfb equations represented in canonical basis with a simple approximation for pairing functional@xcite . the tdhfb equations can be written in terms of the generalized density matrix @xmath6 and the generalized hamiltonian @xmath7@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 composes the one - body density matrix @xmath8 and the pairing - tensor @xmath9 : @xmath10 mean arbitrary basis .",
    "@xmath7 has @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponding to single - particle hamiltonian and pair potential , respectively",
    ". we can express tdhfb state at any time in the canonical ( bcs ) form as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are time - dependent bcs factors and @xmath15 is a creation operator of canonical basis which diagonalizes density matrix @xmath16 .",
    "then , we choose the bcs form of pair potential as @xmath17 where @xmath18 corresponds to the pair tensor @xmath19 in the canonical - basis and @xmath20 is the anti - symmetric two - body matrix element . the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 mean the pair of canonical basis @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . we can obtain the cb - tdhfb equations from the canonical form eq.([eq : bcs ] ) of tdhfb , and with the pair potential eq.([eq : delta ] ) , as follows .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the cb - tdhfb equations compose the time - evolutions of the canonical basis @xmath27 , the occupation probability @xmath28 and the pair probability @xmath29 .",
    "they conserve orthonormal property of the canonical basis and average particle number .",
    "when we choose a special gauge condition @xmath30 , they conserve average total energy .",
    "we introduce neutron - neutron and proton - proton bcs pairing .",
    "the bcs pairing matrix elements @xmath31 is written as @xmath32 .",
    "\\hspace{-15 mm } \\label{eq : viijj0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduce the spin - singlet contact interaction to eq.([eq : viijj0 ] ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 indicates neutron or proton channel and @xmath35 is a strength of pairing@xcite . in this present work ,",
    "we do not use the time - reversal relation between @xmath23- and @xmath21-canonical basis .      at first , we prepare the initial states ( hf or hf+bcs ground states ) with the wave functions for projectile and target at some impact parameter @xmath36 at distance where they feel only coulomb interaction .",
    "then , we boost the wave functions and translational calculate the time - evolution of nuclear densities to obey eq.([eq : cb - tdhfb ] ) . in this present work ,",
    "we use the three - dimensional cartesian coordinate - space representation for the canonical states , @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the coordinate space is a box whose x- , y - sides are 30 fm and z - side is 50 fm , discretized in the square mesh of @xmath39 fm .",
    "we simulate the @xmath0o+@xmath0o collision with incident energy @xmath40 mev which is higher than the coulomb barrier in this system .",
    "initial distance between projectile and target is 12 fm with @xmath41 0 fm .",
    "@xmath0o ( @xmath42=8 , @xmath43=12 ) has superfluidity for neutrons .",
    "the average gap - energy @xmath44 is 1.901 mev .",
    "the number of canonical basis is 24(1.2 times that of tdhf ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of neutron density distributions . after the touch ( @xmath45 : panel ( b ) in fig.1 ) , the density - distribution vibrates keeping the prolate shape .",
    "this shape of a new mean field corresponds to the shape of @xmath46s ( @xmath42=16 , @xmath43=24 ) ground state in intrinsic frame .",
    "figure 2 shows the time - evolution of neutron gap - energy for each canonical basis defined in eq.([eq : delta ] ) . from the touching configuration ,",
    "the gap energies are decreasing significantly .",
    "the decrease is similar to the results of old work@xcite .",
    "we can see the vibration of gap energies related with nuclear density behavior .",
    "we simulated the @xmath0o+@xmath0o collision using time - dependent mean field theory including the effects of nuclear superfluidity , and showed the vibration of gap energies in the collision .",
    "currently , we are investigating the detail of gap energy vibration and relation with the excited states of @xmath46s . to study the pairing effects for collision phenomena",
    ", we should improve our program code to parallel one .",
    "we parallelize the code using mpi for the canonical basis , because the canonical basis conserve orthogonality in the cb - tdhfb which means they do not need gram - schmidt orthonormalization in the real time - evolution .",
    "we can expect the parallelization efficiency of the method is good , due to the relatively small communication - loss .",
    "this work is supported by hpci strategic program field 5 `` the origin of matter and the universe '' , and for computational resource by the riken integrated cluster of clusters(ricc ) and by the sr16000 at yitp in kyoto university .",
