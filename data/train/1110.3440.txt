    "the explanation as to why these two approaches ( determining @xmath118 separately for the systems and as a common function ) give very different results when using ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.3 ] ) , lies in the relationship between direct correlation functions at different @xmath1 .",

    "as the procedure of using a common renormalization function has shown to give good results , an equivalent approach involving separate renormalization functions is to have the effective number of particles in the trap also be dependent on the coupling constant so as to correct the discrepancy .",
