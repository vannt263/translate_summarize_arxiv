    "so , if @xmath7 is a weight on @xmath6 , the weighted bergman projection @xmath12 , i.e. the orthogonal projection of @xmath11 onto @xmath9 , is well - defined .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate lipschitz and sobolev @xmath2 regularities of @xmath12 when @xmath6 is smooth , pseudo - convex and of finite type .    as far as we know , for general finite type domains , only two results were previously known .",
    "first , in @xcite , a. bonami & s. grellier proved lipschitz and sobolev @xmath2 estimates for the weighted bergman projection @xmath12 of a finite type domain in @xmath3 when the weight @xmath7 is a non - negative _ entire _ power of the absolute value of a defining function @xmath1 of the domain ( i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . secondly , in @xcite , d. c. chang & b. q. li extended these results to `` decoupled '' domains in @xmath0 .",
    "the main results of the present paper extend , for special defining functions @xmath1 , those estimates of @xmath12 in two directions .",

    "second we extend the class of domains to include convex domains ( of finite type ) .",
    "moreover , we obtain weighted @xmath5-sobolev regularity of @xmath18 for general pseudo - convex domains of finite type in @xmath0 , @xmath1 being also a special defining function of @xmath6 .    in complex analysis",
    "the ( weighted or not ) bergman projection plays a fundamental role and its regularity has been extensively studied .",
    "a fundamental class of weights is the one introduced by l. hrmander in @xcite in order to solve the @xmath19-equation .",

    "many results have been obtained in this direction in various function spaces . in particular , for ( @xmath5 ) sobolev regularity there is a very large bibliography essentially based on j. j. kohn s work ( see @xcite for a good general presentation ) . for other spaces , a lot of sharp results were obtained by several authors , but there are still basic open problems ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "very few results were obtained for finite type domains .",
    "in addition to the results of a. bonami & s. grellier and d. c. chang & b. q. li cited before , sharp results were obtained for strictly pseudo - convex domains . in the case of the unit ball of @xmath0 , for weights equal to a power greater than @xmath32 of @xmath33 , the kernels of these operators can be written explicitly ( see @xcite ) and then it is possible to obtain very precise estimates .",

    ", @xmath2 estimates for weighted bergman projections can be true only for @xmath35 , and , in general , are not easy to obtain , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the method used in this paper is completely different than that used in a. bonami & s. grellier or d. c. chang & b. q. li papers .",
    "it is inspired by a well - known method introduced by f. forelli and w. rudin ( see @xcite ) : we look at @xmath6 as a slice of a pseudo - convex domain @xmath36 of finite type in @xmath37 and try to deduce estimates for weighted bergman projections of @xmath6 from estimates of the unweighted bergman projection of @xmath36 .",
