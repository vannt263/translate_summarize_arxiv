    "the heavy ion accelerator project s raon affiliated to the institute for basic science(ibs ) is a korean heavy ion accelerator that will be constructed in daejeon in 2017 @xcite .",
    "the name raon is a pure korean term that means  pleasant \" .",
    "it basically aims to examine the origin of the strong force by studying the interactions between the nuclei that construct rare isotope and is expected to train a lot of domestic experts of accelerator@xcite .    as a branch of the raon accelerator , we propose a construction of the first muon beamline in korea .",
    "the muon beam is very difficult to handle because they start life as a hot gas @xcite , but the scientists can perform the various research with the muon beam .",
    "paul scherrer institute ( psi ) @xcite and japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) @xcite overcame this problem and run their own muon beamlines , but korea does not have one yet . if korea has the muon beamline , it will enhance the level of basic science of korea remarkably and raise the global competitiveness in science area",
    ".    stimulated by this intention , we have designed muon beamline as shown in fig .",
    "this beamline is designed with 600 mev kinetic energy proton beam on a fixed target , and the beamline elements are optimized to provide 130 mev / c antimuons with low contamination . in order to perform this study , we used special software packages , g4beamline @xcite : the particle tracking simulation program based on geant4 @xcite and transport @xcite : the calculation program that gives the appropriate values to be applied to the magnet elements in the beamline to simulate particle production and decays , and their transport through beamline optics .    the schematic view of the optimized muon beamline",

    "the simulations were conducted with the g4beamline monte carlo package . for applications of muon beamline in low energy physics , g4eamline recommends to use the qgsp@xmath3bert physics list which uses the quark gluon string model and geant4 bertini cascade @xcite .",
    "each run consisted of @xmath4 proton events on the fixed target and the events were generated by pseudo random number generator with time .",
    "we consulted j - parc and placed 20 mm graphite target @xcite , and from the view point of the beam sharing with the surface muon study group , we decided to rotate the target @xmath6 with respect to the @xmath7 direction @xcite .",
    "the nuclear reactions between the 600 mev kinetic energy proton beam and the nucleus of carbon produce various secondary particles and the 1219 mev / c protons play the most significant role for the contamination .",
    "we choose 200 mev / c @xmath1 and separated them from the protons with the rectangular dipole that applies 0.5 t in the -@xmath8 direction .",
    "if we assume both the protons and @xmath1 move on the design orbit , 1219 mev / c protons draw a circle of 8.13 m radius while about 200 mev / c pions draw a circle of 1.3 m radius . as a result ,",
    "both particles proceed into different directions and we can separate the @xmath1 from the protons . then , the first quadrupole set is used to gather and focus the bent pions .",

    "this is because the stronger magnetic field helps the charged particles to have smaller radius of helical motion , so that they can avoid the collision with the solenoid body .",
    "however , it does not increase drastically after 5 t , so we determined to apply this field to the solenoid , similar to @xmath13e1 beamline at psi @xcite .",
