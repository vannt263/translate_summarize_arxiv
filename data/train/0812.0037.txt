    "the thompson group @xmath0 can be regarded as the group of piecewise - linear , + orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the unit interval which have breakpoints only at dyadic points and on intervals of differentiability the slopes are powers of two .",
    "the group was discovered in the 60s by richard thompson and in connection with the now celebrated groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 led to the first example of a finitely presented infinite simple group . also , it has been shown that the commutator subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 is simple .    in 1979 r. geoghegan conjectured that @xmath0 is not amenable .",
    "this problem is still open and of importance for group theory : either outcome will help better understand the inclusions @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the class of elementary amenable groups , @xmath11 is the class of amenable groups and @xmath12 is the class of groups not containing free ( non - abelian ) groups . by work of grigorchuck @xcite , olshanskii and sapir @xcite ,",
    "the inclusions above are strict .",
    "there are properties stronger than amenability and also weaker ones .",
    "there is naturally a great deal of interest in knowing which ones hold or fail in the case of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , from the weak perspective the question of exactness has been put forward in @xcite .",
    "we also find a two - folded interest in whether or not the reduced @xmath6 algebra of @xmath0 is quasidiagonal ( qd ) : by a result of rosenberg in @xcite this property implies that the group is amenable .",
    "it is also conjectured that any countable amenable group generates a qd reduced @xmath6 algebra . as a consequence",
    ", the ( non)qd property gives another spin to the amenability question of @xmath0 .",
    "we prove a weaker result than non - qd , namely the reduced @xmath6 algebra of @xmath0 is not _ residually finite dimensional_.    the thompson s groups have infinite conjugacy classes and therefore the associated von neumann algebras are @xmath4 factors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , p. jolissaint proved that the @xmath4 factor associated with the thompson group @xmath0 has the relative mcduff property with respect to the @xmath4 factor determined by @xmath1 ; in particular both are mcduff factors . by finding a presentation of the commutator subgroup we naturally recover another result of jolissaint ( @xcite ) , namely that the @xmath4 factor @xmath5 is ( inner ) asymptotically abelian .",
    "the last property has been introduced by s. sakai in the 70 s and consists essentially of a stronger requirement than property @xmath13 of murray and von neumann : instead of a sequence of unitaries almost commuting with the elements of the factor one wants a sequence of ( inner ) * -isomorphisms to do the job .",
    "moreover , asymptotically abelian is a stronger property than mcduff ( see the background section below ) .",
    "in @xcite , d. gaboriau introduced a new dynamical invariant for a countable discrete group called cost .",
    "infinite amenable groups have cost 1 and also thompson s group @xmath0 has cost 1 , while the free group on @xmath14 generators has cost @xmath14 .",
    "as the cost non - decreases when passing to normal subgroups , finding the cost of @xmath1 becomes an interesting question .",
    "using our new presentation of @xmath1 and one of the tools developed by gaboriau we show that @xmath1 has cost 1 as well ( and because @xmath1 is simple we get that any non - trivial normal subgroup of @xmath0 has cost 1 ) .",
    "it is very likely that any non - trivial subgroup of @xmath0 has cost @xmath3 .",
    "this problem might be related to a conjecture of m. brin : _ any subgroup of @xmath0 is either elementary amenable or contains a copy of @xmath0 _ ( conjecture 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the background section prepares some basics on the thompson groups , group von neumann algebras and cost of groups .",
    "we have collected some known facts and also folklore - like facts , mostly about the thompson s groups .",
    "the follow - up to this section is our main result which describes various presentations of the groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "hence we find the following question very interesting : is @xmath341 ( or @xmath342 ) asymptotically abelian ?      because any proper quotient of @xmath0 is abelian , any non - trivial , normal subgroup of @xmath0 must contain @xmath1 .",
