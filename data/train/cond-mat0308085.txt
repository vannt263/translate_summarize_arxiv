    "the experimental loading of a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in both one- @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite optical lattice potentials generated by standing - wave laser fields has initiated a new class of investigations .",
    "the optical - lattice potential has been used in the study of matter - wave interference @xcite , of oscillating atomic current in a one dimensional array of josephson junctions @xcite , of bloch oscillation and landau zenner tunneling @xcite , of superfluid - insulator classical @xcite and quantum @xcite phase transitions , and in the generation of matter - wave bright soliton @xcite .    as the size of the condensates in above experiments",
    "is much too small , one may resort to an expansion in order to photograph , observe or study it .",
    "actually , expansion of the condensate formed on an optical lattice was crucial in the confirmation of josephson oscillation across an array of one - dimensional junctions @xcite , of bloch oscillation and landau - zenner tunneling @xcite , of superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition @xcite , and of transition from superfluid to a classical insulator @xcite .",
    "hence it is of interest to perform a theoretical study of the expansion of the bec formed on a joint one - dimensional optical - lattice and axially - symmetric harmonic traps upon the removal of either trap and compare with available experiments @xcite .",
    "here we undertake this study using the mean - field axially - symmetric gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "there have been similar studies of free expansion of an axially - symmetric bec in the absence of an optical - lattice potential @xcite .    for the present study",
    "we consider the expansion of a bec on a joint one - dimensional optical - lattice and axially - symmetric harmonic potentials with the optical - lattice aligned along the axial direction of the harmonic potential .",
    "first we consider switching off the harmonic trap alone . in this case",
    "the condensate expands along the radial direction maintaining an almost constant transverse size .",
    "we also reconsider the free expansion of such a bec formed in the absence of an optical - lattice potential . in both cases",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath0 half - width of a gaussian fit to the density profile in the axial and radial directions are obtained and found to be in good agreement with experiments by morsch _",

    "the periodic one - dimensional optical - lattice potential divides the whole bec in parallel slices . upon the removal of the optical - lattice trap these slices",
    "expand and interfere with each other .",
    "the result is the formation of an interference pattern of three peaks .",
    "however , in the presence of the harmonic trap the side peaks execute simple - harmonic oscillation with a definite frequency and amplitude .",
    "if the interference pattern is allowed to evolve in the harmonic trap for some hold time and the harmonic trap is then switched off , prominent interference pattern continues for small hold time . with the increase of hold time",

    "the mean - field gp equation ( [ a ] ) can be derived for a dilute and weakly - interacting system .",
    "this is based on the condition that the scattering length @xmath10 be much smaller than the average distance between atoms and @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the dilute gas approximation can be written as @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 is the average density of the gas . however , for a simple and practical estimate of the weakly interacting condition one should compare the interaction energy @xmath32 with the kinetic energy of the system @xmath33 . from theoretical consideration",

    "the explanation for the phenomenon observed in figures 5 is as follows .",
    "as the system oscillates in the harmonic potential upon the removal of the optical - lattice potential , after every half cycle of oscillation the system passes through the same initial state when the optical - lattice potential is removed @xcite .",
    "this initial state is a coherent state on the optical lattice and after a free expansion leads to the interference pattern .",
    "however , if the system is allowed to evolve in the harmonic potential for some time after removing the optical - lattice potential and then subject to a free expansion a completely different scenario emerges . in general , the three expanding bright spots would now be moving freely in  wrong \" directions so that they may interact and collide with each other upon removal of the harmonic trap and lose their identity resulting in a loss of the observed interference pattern in figures 5 .",
    "this defocussing effect in the interference pattern would be absent for hold times equal to a multiple of half period of oscillation and would be minimal for hold times near these values consistent with figures 5 .",
    "there has been a recent attempt to study a similar phenomenon in a different context using a one - dimensional mean - field model @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , using the explicit numerical solution of the axially - symmetric gp equation we have studied the expansion of a bec formed in a joint harmonic and optical - lattice traps when either trap is removed .",
    "when the harmonic trap is removed the piece of condensate in a particular site expands radially without moving to the next site . as a result",
    "the whole condensate expands radially maintaining a fixed axial size .",
    "the shape of the condensate and its radial and axial sizes during expansion are found to evolve in agreement with the experiments of @xcite . when the optical trap is removed",
    "the pieces of the bec at different sites expand and interfere to form a distinct pattern with three peaks which keep on oscillating according to ( [ shm ] ) in agreement with present simulation and experiment of @xcite . if the interference pattern is allowed to evolve in the harmonic trap for some hold time and the harmonic trap removed , prominent interference pattern appears for small hold time , which become blurred and finally , disappear with the increase of hold time in agreement with the experiment of @xcite .",
