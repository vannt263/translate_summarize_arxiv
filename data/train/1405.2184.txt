    "this correspondence suggests that the difference between the entanglement entropy of the bcs ground state and the unentangled normal metal state may be physically interpreted as a measure analogous to the difference in free energy between the superconducting and normal phases . as an aside , since the integrals used to evaluate the effective and critical temperatures are distinct , their approximate equality may be of interest to number theorists .",

    "this approximation is justified by the fact that the partial entanglement entropy @xmath62 is peaked about the fermi surface with a width of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "evaluating the integral gives @xmath63 the quantity @xmath64 is the approximate number of electron orbitals in a shell of width @xmath65 about the fermi energy @xmath10 , which is precisely the interaction region where partial contributions to the total spin - ee are largest ( fig .",

    "we remark that this example of component entanglement due to cooper pairing within an energy shell has similarities to the valence bond entanglement entropy , which is a measure of the number of spin - singlets shared between spatial partitions in a valence bond state.@xcite this analogy clarifies the picture of entanglement as a measure of correlations across a partition and the general expectation of area laws when correlations are short - ranged .",
    "the simple result shows that the spin - ee is proportional to the pairing energy @xmath8 .",
    "this is a clear demonstration of how interactions between spin components lead to entanglement in a many - body system . when the coupling between spin - up and spin - down electrons vanishes at the superconductor - normal metal transition ( @xmath70 ) the ground state mode entanglement vanishes also .",
    "indeed , a similar measure of total mode entanglement in the bcs ground state called the macrocanonical entanglement of pairing ( mep)@xcite has been shown to vanish as @xmath71 .",

    "the fact that these entanglement measures vanish when the pairing energy vanishes agrees completely with our previous result that the temperature of the effective thermal model matches the critical bcs temperature .",
    "a seemingly contrasting result@xcite emphasizes the importance of properly defining the partitioning scheme when discussing entanglement entropy . in a previous study of a spatially partitioned bcs ground state on a lattice ,",
    "the single - site entanglement entropy shows a completely opposite dependence on the pairing energy versus the spin - ee.@xcite it turns out that the single - site entropy is maximum in the normal metal @xmath73 and diminishes as the gap opens in the superconducting phase",

    "the total spin - ee is dominated by the contributions of orbitals in the vicinity of the fermi energy . ]",
    "the reduced spin - up electron state @xmath74 is a statistical operator over fock states and the number of paired spin - up electrons @xmath75 therefore fluctuates in the ground state .",
    "the associated variance in spin - up electron number is equal to @xmath76 = \\sum_\\vec{k } { \\left| u_\\vec{k } \\right|}^2 { \\left| v_\\vec{k } \\right|}^2.\\ ] ] in the same approximation @xmath59 used to calculate @xmath77 ,",
    "we find @xmath78 which is one - fourth of the variance in total electron number in @xmath28 , @xmath79 . this relationship can be interpreted physically as follows : pair interactions controlled by @xmath8 lead to pair number fluctuations in the bcs ground state .",
    "thus , electrons in the bcs state are gained and lost in pairs of opposite spin . this correlated fluctuation in the number of electrons of opposite spin",
    "gives rise to uncertainty in the determination of the reduced states @xmath74 and @xmath80 and , hence , to non - zero entanglement entropy .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the spin - ee and the number fluctuations in the bcs state are equal : @xmath81 .",
    "a similar relationship has been reported between local orbital concurrence and occupation number fluctuations.@xcite these numerical equivalences can be expected from a mean - field theory with bcs - like interactions and has been anticipated by the exact calculation of the full counting statistics ( fcs ) function for the bcs state.@xcite    the proportionality between entanglement entropy and subsystem number fluctuations has been explored previously in spatially - partitioned fermion gases and other conformally - invariant theories.@xcite however , the mechanism behind the number fluctuations in these latter examples is the gain / loss of particles from one spatial partition to another , and not the population / depopulation of electron orbitals as in the spin - partitioned bcs state discussed here .",
    "entanglement between the spin components is unaffected by unitary transformations within the subspace of either component .",
    "our results therefore apply to ground states of other models with bilinear interactions between components . for example",
    ", a particle - hole transformation in one component gives the interaction term @xmath82 , which can describe elastic scattering of spin - flipped electrons by fixed magnetic impurities in a mean - field approach.@xcite furthermore , the spin labels may be replaced by other component or isospin labels and our results may be used to describe mode entanglement in other two component systems such as electron system bilayers.@xcite the main requirement for the validity of these generalizations is that the component interactions are quasi - local in momentum space , as they are in the mean - field theory of cooper pairing .",
    "additionally , since the total spin - ee is a sum over independent partial terms , one can expect a scaling relationship similar to eq .   to hold even when the pairing energy @xmath8 depends on the wavevector @xmath17 , as long as @xmath83 slowly varies within the debye shell .",
    "we have completely characterized the entanglement between spin components of the bcs ground state .",
    "the reduced states are mixed and described by a probability distribution of occupancies that is identical to a generalized gibbs distribution with momentum dependent temperature , and similar to that of an effective non - interacting fermion gas at thermal equilibrium .",
    "we demonstrated that the temperature of the effective canonical ensemble is nearly equal to the critical temperature @xmath84 \\approx 1.76/\\delta$ ] .",
    "we emphasize that this result , which uses an effective thermal description of the partitioned ground state ( @xmath85 ) , is distinct from ( but related to ) the well - established critical value @xmath86 .",
    "the latter result is derived from the thermodynamics of quasiparticle excitations at non - zero temperature ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "also , we have calculated the spin entanglement entropy in @xmath28 and showed that it obeys an area law that is independent of system dimensionality .",
    "that is , the spin - ee is proportional to the number of electron orbitals about the fermi surface . finally , we provided exact quantitative arguments that the spin - ee in bcs and bcs - like ground states arise from ground state fluctuations in the occupancy of cooper pair orbitals .    in general , the entanglement entropy is a measure of the number of correlated degrees of freedom across a partition weighted by the strength of correlations .",
    "the simple example provided by the bcs ground state illustrates this in a very simple manner .",
    "the results presented here are not sensitive to the particular model under consideration in the following sense .",
    "if the effective distribution of electron ( or fermionic quasiparticle ) occupancies obtained from the entanglement spectrum possesses the following qualitative features : ( i ) unit occupation deep within the fermi sphere , ( ii ) zero occupation far above the fermi sphere , and ( iii ) a smooth transition of width @xmath88 about the fermi energy , then the component entanglement entropy will scale according to the area law @xmath89 .",
