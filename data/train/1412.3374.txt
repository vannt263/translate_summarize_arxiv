    "increasingly often in recent years the shape of data has been analyzed using persistent homology @xcite . given a topological space ( e.g. , a simplicial complex built upon a finite set of points in @xmath0 ) , one constructs a nested family of subspaces called a filtration , and studies the topological events occurring along the filtration .",
    "these are encoded in a structure known as a persistence vector space , and consists of a family of vector spaces obtained as the homology of the subspaces in the filtration , connected by linear maps induced in homology by the inclusion maps of the filtration . by constructing a filtration and taking its",
    "homology one transforms a topological problem into linear algebra .",
    "this theory is well understood when filtrations only depend on one parameter , whereas still presents many open problems in the multi - parameter case , commonly referred to as the multidimensional persistent homology theory . on the other hand",
    ", applications strongly motivate the interest in multi - filtrations .",
    "recently , the problem of comparing persistence vector spaces in a stable and optimal way has been successfully solved by using families of linear maps between persistence vector spaces , known as interleavings @xcite . however , in concrete cases , computing the interleaving distance is still not a viable option because of its complexity",
    ". therefore it may be useful to find estimates for it .",
    "the rank invariant is the most studied invariant of persistence vector spaces .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to show that the multidimensional matching distance on rank invariants studied in @xcite provides a lower bound for the interleaving distance . from a different standpoint , this fact can be viewed as a new proof that the rank invariant is a stable invariant when rank invariants are compared via 1-dimensional reduction along lines .",
