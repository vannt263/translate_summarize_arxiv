    "the properties of abrikosov flux lattices in layered superconductors are of considerable interest in view of numerous experiments on high @xmath8 compounds @xcite . for magnetic field",
    "perpendicular to the layers , the flux lattice can be considered as two dimensional point vortices in each superconducting layer which are stacked one on top of the other .",
    "each point vortex , or a pancake vortex , represents a singularity of the superconducting order parameter , i.e. the superconductor s phase in a given layer changes by @xmath9 around the vortex .",
    "these pancake vortices are coupled by their magnetic field as well as by the josephson tunneling between nearest layers .",
    "the fluctuations of the displacements of pancake vortices are manifested by a variety of experiments @xcite , and affect phase transitions such as melting of the flux lattice and layer decoupling , i.e. vanishing of the interlayer josephson coupling on long scales @xcite .",
    "a harmonic expansion of the flux lattice energy to second order in displacements of the flux lines , defines in general the elastic constants @xcite . for anisotropic layer systems",
    "a harmonic expansion was studied by glazman and koshelev ( gk ) @xcite .",
    "this expansion is , however , nontrivial , since it involves expanding the nonlinear josephson coupling @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relative phase of neighboring layers .",
    "when two pancake vortices which are one on the top of the other are separated by a distance @xmath12 ( parallel to the layers ) then @xmath11 has large variations in a circle of radius @xmath0 between these pancake vortices .",
    "this effect has led gk @xcite to anticipate a @xmath1 term in the energy expansion when @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the in - layer coherence length .",
    "this term was also found by kramer @xcite for a single vortex line and independently by us @xcite .    in this work we present the detailed energy expansion .",
    "in addition to the difficulty at short scales , leading to the @xmath1 term , we find that the convergence parameter of the expansion vanishes as @xmath15 when the josephson coupling @xmath16 .",
    "thus the @xmath17 elastic constants are not recovered by a @xmath16 limit .",
    "we then show ( section iii d ) how to define effective elastic constants and apply our results ( section iv ) to thermal averages of @xmath18 .",
    "in particular we find @xmath19 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the josephson length and @xmath5 is the flux line spacing .",
    "the expansion parameter indicates the type of dominant fluctuation with a related instability , i.e. for @xmath7 the decoupling transition dominates while for @xmath3 the melting transition dominates .",
