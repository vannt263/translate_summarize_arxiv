    "the major goal of colliding heavy - ions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to study matter at extreme conditions of temperature and energy densities , where quarks and gluons , rather than mesons and baryons , define the relevant degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "this new phase of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is governed by the principles of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and is the result of a phase transition from the normal nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "experiments at rhic and lhc are on the quest to unearth the nature of the qcd phase transition and to get a glimpse of how matter behaves at extreme conditions .",
    "the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at rhic has been initiated to explore the onset of phase transition by scanning the collision energy over a larger range and to locate the critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the thermodynamic state of the qcd matter can be specified by the temperature @xmath4 and the chemical potentials @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to the conserved charges of qcd , namely baryon number ( @xmath8 ) , strangeness ( @xmath9 ) , and electric charge ( @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "phase transitions are associated with the transformation of thermodynamic quantities such as pressure , entropy and energy density , as well as a set of response functions , like , specific heat , compressibility and susceptibility with change in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 . in this article",
    ", we discuss the specific heat ( @xmath0 ) of the system produced in heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies and its behaviour as a function of collision energy .",
    "specific heat is a thermodynamic quantity characterizing the equation of state of the system . for a system undergoing phase transition , @xmath0",
    "is expected to diverge at the critical point .",
    "temperature fluctuation of the system provides an estimation of @xmath0 . near the critical point",
    ", the specific heat is normally expressed in terms of a power law , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the critical temperature and @xmath13 is critical exponent .",
    "thus the variation of thermal fluctuations with temperature can be effectively used to probe the critical point .",
    "hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model analysis of the particle yields indicate the formation of a thermal source for the produced particles in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the production of large number of particles in each collision at the rhic and lhc energies makes it even possible to study several quantities on an event - by - event basis  @xcite and hence measure their event to event fluctuations .",
    "thus , with the measurement of @xmath4 on an event - by - event basis , it is possible to extract the @xmath0  of the hot and dense strongly interacting matter produced in heavy - ion collisions . assuming complete thermal equilibrium up to the surface of last scattering which is the kinetic freeze - out surface , @xmath0  is then expected to reveal the thermodynamic state of the matter at the moment of kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the specific heat and its variation as a function of temperature have been studied extensively in different theoretical calculations .",
    "statistical and hrg models have been used to obtain @xmath0  as a function of temperature in hadron gas and in quark - gluon matter  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a parton and hadron cascade model has been used to investigate @xmath0  as a function of beam energy for the initial partonic stage using quark - gluon matter and the final stage using hadronic matter .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite provide estimations of @xmath0  for a wide range of temperatures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , continuum limits of @xmath0  have been calculated in quenched qcd at temperatures of 2@xmath12 and 3@xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the transition temperature .",
    "it is found that @xmath0  differs significantly from that of the ideal gas .",
    "recent lattice calculations using ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd with almost physical quark masses give the results of @xmath0  for a temperature range of 130 to 400 mev  @xcite .",
    "the low temperature ( hadron phase ) results agree well with hrg .",
    "the specific heat has its origin in the event - by - event temperature fluctuations , which manifests through the fluctuations in the transverse momenta ( @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath1  have been reported by experiments at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps )  @xcite and beam energy scan at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath0  extracted from the experimental results have large errors  @xcite . the @xmath2  fluctuation data from ref .",
    "@xcite yielded the value of @xmath0  to be @xmath14 at @xmath15  mev for sps energies .",
    "the statistical fluctuations arising from the finite multiplicity distributions of charged particles may significantly affect the extracted thermodynamic fluctuations  @xcite . in the present work , this is taken care of by subtracting the widths of the results of mixed events from the real data . since radial flow affects the estimation of temperature , its effect has also been considered .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath0  have been calculated as a function of beam energy from published experimental data and compared to lattice and hrg calculations .",
    "further predictions have been made for the lhc energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section - ii , we present the methodology for extraction of @xmath0  from event - by - event average transverse momentum distributions and from theoretical calculations .",
    "the hrg model calculations of specific heat are presented in section  iii .",
    "event - by - event distributions of mean transverse momenta have been reported by several experiments at cern - sps and rhic .",
    "the @xmath1  distributions and corresponding values of effective temperatures are presented in section  iv .",
    "a compilation of the results of specific heat from the existing experimental data is presented in section v. estimates for the specific heat at lhc using the ampt model  @xcite have been included in this section . a discussion on the results of @xmath0is given in section  vi .",
    "the paper is summarised with an outlook in section  vii .",
    "the heat capacity @xmath16 of a system is defined as  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are temperature , volume and energy of the system , respectively .",
    "equivalently , @xmath16  of a system in thermal equilibrium to a bath at @xmath4 can be computed from the event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath19 : @xmath20 for a system in equilibrium , the event - by - event temperature fluctuation is controlled by the heat capacity : @xmath21 , \\label{eqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the mean temperature and @xmath23 is the variance in temperature .",
    "this yields the expression for @xmath16  @xcite : @xmath24 heat capacity thus can be estimated from the fluctuations in energy or temperature . for a system in equilibrium , the mean values of @xmath4 and @xmath19 are related by an equation of state .",
    "however , the fluctuations in energy and temperature have very different behaviour .",
    "energy being an extensive quantity , its fluctuation has a volume dependent component .",
    "so energy is not suited for obtaining the heat capacity . on the other hand ,",
    "temperature fluctuations provide a good major for estimating the @xmath0  @xcite",
    ".    the temperature of the system can be obtained from the transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) spectra of the emitted particles .",
    "an exponential boltzmann - type fit to the @xmath2  spectra gives a measure of the temperature : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization factor and @xmath27  is the apparent or effective temperature of the system  @xcite .",
    "for obtaining the event - by - event fluctuation , the temperature needs to be estimated in every event .",
    "the fitting is possible only for central heavy - ion collisions at the lhc energies when the number of particles is at least one thousand in every event . even in this case , the error associated with the fitting will be relatively large .",
    "this can be overcome by making a connection of mean transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) of particles in every event with the temperature . since the calculation of the mean value is more stable , this method of temperature estimation",
    "can also be used for collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the @xmath1  can be written as  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the rest mass of the particle .",
