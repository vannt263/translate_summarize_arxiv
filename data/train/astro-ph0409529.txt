    "understanding the physical and kinematic conditions in a molecular cloud core just prior to the onset of gravitational collapse is of paramount importance if one wishes to study the subsequent protostellar evolution .",
    "molecular line measurements can provide the kinematical informations to probe infall motions in the highest density nucleus as long as the observed species is reasonably abundant in the region of interest .",
    "+ an important step forward in starless core studies has been the understanding of the fact that , at temperatures of roughly 10  k and densities above a few times @xmath12  @xmath7 , co , as well as other carbon - bearing molecules , condenses out onto dust grain surfaces preventing us from observing the high - density structures from where one expects the first signs of collapse @xcite .",
    "this is most clearly seen from the comparison of maps made in the millimeter dust continuum with maps of co isotopologues @xcite .",
    "+ for reasons that are thought to have to do with the low binding energy of the n@xmath0 molecule on ice mantle surfaces @xcite , there are some n - containing molecular species that survive in the gas phase at least for densities in the range @xmath13@xmath14  @xmath7 . in particular , maps of n@xmath0h@xmath1  and nh@xmath15   ( as well as their deuterated counterparts ) show reasonable agreement with the distribution of dust emission .",
    "thus , only from observations of such species one can hope to probe the physical and chemical conditions of the most evolved pre ",
    "stellar cores that show a high column density peak in the dust emission .",
    "+ one can also hope that by studying samples of such high density objects it will be possible to identify the cores where collapse has already been initiated or is at the point of doing so .",
    "the aim of the this paper is to report the results of a survey of 31 cores in various transitions of n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1  observed with the iram  30-m telescope .    these observations , besides probing the kinematics of the high density nucleus of starless cores , enable us to gauge the deuterium enrichment in our sample .",
    "this parameter , evaluated from the n@xmath0d@xmath1  over n@xmath0h@xmath1  column density ratio , can be used as a tool to discriminate the evolutionary status of a starless core .",
    "in fact , the disappearance of co from the gas phase , together with the exothermicity of the production of h@xmath16d@xmath17 , leads to abundances of deuterated species in cold molecular clouds more than 3 orders of magnitudes larger than the [ d]/[h ] elemental abundance ( @xmath18 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the freeze - out of the co onto the grain mantles decreases the destruction of h@xmath16d@xmath17  and h@xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "the enhanced h@xmath19  abundance speeds up the reaction that leads to a higher production of h@xmath16d@xmath17  and this increases the ratio of [ h@xmath16d@xmath17]/[h@xmath19 ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we expect to use the @xmath2  ratio to discriminate the less evolved starless cores from the more advanced pre  stellar cores . for practical purposes in this study ,",
    "we define `` pre  stellar cores '' to be those with an @xmath2  abundance ratio @xmath22 0.1 , and we believe that this approximately corresponds to a core with central density greater than @xmath23  @xmath7  that is in the last phase of its evolution prior to dynamical collapse .",
    "we base this partly on the cross - correlation of our @xmath2  measurements with other properties expected to probe an enhanced evolution of the starless cores such as broader line widths , larger @xmath24(h@xmath3 ) central density , or larger amount of co freeze - out . for this reason ,",
    "supplemental dust continuum and c@xmath8o@xmath9  measurements , able to furnish the h@xmath3  density profile and the co depletion , were carried out in cases in which these were not available in the literature .    in   [ obs ] of this paper , we outline our observational technique both for the n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1 observations and for the dust continuum and c@xmath8o@xmath9  . in   [ res ] , we summarize our direct observational results , and in   [ ana ] we derive physical and chemical quantities for the cores in our sample . in   [ dis ]",

    "the results of the hyperfine structure fitting of the high - s / n ( @xmath4 5 ) 1 mm spectra are reported in table  [ tfit1 mm ] .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fspectraco ] the c@xmath8o@xmath9(10 ) and ( 21 ) spectra towards the peak of l1521f , l694 - 2 , l183 , tmc2 and l492 .",
    "integrated intensities and results of the gaussian fits for these observations are reported in table  [ tfitco ] .",
    "a detailed description of the maps obtained in this work can be found in the appendix  [ maps ] , where we also analyse core shapes and kinematics ( appendix  [ shape ] ) of individual objects .",
    "here we briefly summarize the main results .",
    "our new maps confirm the well known finding that n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1  well trace the millimeter dust continuum emission , unlike co ( e.g. caselli et al . 1999 ; bergin et al . 2001 ; tafalla et al .",
    "we also find that the majority of the cores are `` cometary '' in shape , suggesting that the cores have been either compressed by external agents or have moved relatively to the surrounding environment ( but see walsh & myers 2004 ) . in general",
    ", they do not show an axisymmetric morphology .",
    "finally , we studied the kinematics in individual cores , evaluating the `` total '' and `` local '' velocity gradients and finding that only in one case ( l694 - 2 ) the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) line width increases toward the core center , indicating the presence of enhanced dynamical activity ( likely due to infall ) , as already found in l1544 ( caselli et al .",
    "2002a ) and l1521f ( crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in the rest of the paper we concentrate on the physical and chemical parameters at the relative peak of the whole source sample",
    "in this section we derive the physical and chemical properties that can best discriminate the evolutionary status of a starless core , either in a chemical sense , as a more pronounced deuterium enrichment and a higher co depletion factor , or for dynamical reasons , like the presence of a denser and more centrally concentrated h@xmath3 distribution or broader n@xmath0h@xmath1  line widths .",
    "we expect to characterize through these parameters the pre ",
    "stellar cores , i.e. , the subset of starless cores that present enhanced chemical evolution and/or dynamical activity .      the deuterium fractionation can be evaluated from observations of a hydrogen bearing molecule and one of its deuterated counterparts by calculating the ratio of their column densities .",
    "recent work has made use of hco@xmath1 , h@xmath0co@xmath9 , hnc , n@xmath0h@xmath1  and nh@xmath15 , as well as their single or multiple deuterated isotopologues , to evaluate this parameter in starless cores @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , given the depletion of hco@xmath1  and h@xmath0co@xmath9  in the core nucleus @xcite , that the deuterium fractionation estimated from this species is relative to an outer shell and not to the high - density nucleus .    in this work we derived n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1  column densities assuming a constant excitation temperature ( the ctex method : see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "the excitation temperature of n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) was derived from hyperfine fitting of the spectra with well constrained opacities ( @xmath39 , where the total optical depth @xmath40 and its associated error @xmath41 have been derived assuming a constant excitation temperature for the hyperfine components ; see also table  [ tfit ] ) ; otherwise the spectrum was assumed optically thin and the excitation temperature was set to 4.8  k ( the average excitation temperature in our sample ) .",
    "the excitation temperature of n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) was set equal to that of n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) in those cases in which the opacity was not well constrained .",
    "the effect of underestimating the n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) excitation temperature by , e.g. , 1  k would be a decrease of @xmath10(n@xmath0d@xmath1 ) by 30% . + as noted above , in the case of n@xmath0h@xmath1 , the optically thin assumption is often incorrect and hence we have used the intensity of the ( @xmath36 ) ( weak ) component normalized appropriately in order to estimate the j=0 column density .    the final result can be seen in figure  [ fn2dn2h ] , where the n@xmath0h@xmath1  column density is plotted versus the n@xmath0d@xmath1  column density .",
    "the estimated @xmath2  ratio varies between 0.44 in oph d and an upper limit of 0.02 in l1400k .",

    "@xcite found a similar result using n@xmath0h@xmath1  and suggest that a way to reconcile gas density estimates from dust observations with those from molecular line observations is to increase the dust mass opacity to @xmath69  @xmath57  g@xmath33 , a value typical of fluffy aggregates with ice mantles .",
    "we stress that higher resolution observations are strongly needed to confirm this trend .      in starless",
    "cores the h@xmath3  density profile can be approximated by a region of roughly constant density followed by a power - law decrease @xcite ; this behaviour is reflected in the 1.2-mm continuum emission . since the `` flattened nucleus '' is expected to become smaller with the ongoing of infall , its size gives us a measure of the relative contraction stage reached by the cores .",
    "unfortunately each author uses different definitions for the size of the flattened region ; thus , we have measured , for the 13 cores with a 1.2-mm map , the area within the 70% contour of the dust peak .",
    "we then translated this into a radius ( reported as @xmath70 in figures and tables ) by evaluating the square root of this area divided by @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting values are reported in column ( 5 ) of table  [ tfd_nh2 ] .",
    "this approach is useful for a relative comparison of the different cores .",
    "the choice of the 70% contour as threshold is justified by the fact that we wanted to limit the influence of the `` cometary tail '' ( see section  [ shape ] ) on the @xmath70 determination .",
    "we also evaluated the aspect ratio of the dust emission measuring the major and minor axis size of the 50% contour and 70% contour ( results are shown in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of table  [ tfd_nh2 ] ) .",
    "we found that the axis ratio increases at lower contours in the more cometary cores , reaching values up to 2.5 .",
    "the analysis of the line profile gives us clues on the core kinematics .",
    "in fact , motions along the line of sight combined with optical depth effects , molecular abundance variations and temperature gradients alter the line profile , causing departures from a gaussian line shape .",
    "in particular , looking at the density peak , we expect a `` blue shoulder '' in the case of outflow motions and a `` red shoulder '' in the case of infall motions ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    here , we determine the degree of line asymmetry by calculating the line skewness , or the third moment , of a distribution equivalent to the line profile .",
    "this is defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the first and second moments of the same distribution and @xmath10 is the total number of points ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "by definition , the third moment measures the deviation from a symmetric distribution , as the first moment furnishes its mean and the second yields its dispersion .",
    "it is a non - dimensional quantity and assumes positive values for distributions that have a `` tail '' in the values higher than the mean and negative values in the opposite case .",
    "we applied this analysis to the ( @xmath75 ) component of n@xmath0h@xmath1   ( the fourth starting from the lower velocities ) .",
    "the `` isolated '' ( @xmath76 , the one at lowest velocity ) and the `` weak '' ( @xmath36 , the one at highest velocity ) components show approximately the same behaviour as this one in the very high s / n spectra ( rms @xmath77  k with a 0.063  km s@xmath28  channel spacing ) ; thus , in order to enlarge the sample to spectra with slightly lower s / n ( rms @xmath78  k ) , we used the data from the ( @xmath75 ) component , which also provides a sufficient isolation from the other components even in the spectra with broadest line widths .",
    "moreover , given the role of the optical depth in the production of the asymmetric profiles , the ( @xmath75 ) component is supposed to have a more pronounced skewness than the other two components .",
    "results are shown in table  [ tfd_nh2 ] .",
    "eight cores show red - skewed `` contracting '' profiles , six cores show blue - skewed `` expanding '' profiles , and seven cores have symmetric profiles within the error bars .",
    "note that the line peak in the `` contracting '' profiles falls at lower velocities ( or on the blue side ) than @xmath73 whereas asymmetric profiles with outflow character are the reverse .",
    "in the following we discuss the relations between the quantities determined in the previous sections and compare them with simple theoretical expectations .",
    "we divide this section into two main parts : in the first we concentrate on the connection between deuterium fractionation and the other chemical and dynamical parameters derived in section  [ ana ] , while in the second we cross - correlate only the parameters linked with the kinematical activity .",
    "an observational proof of the chemical model relating the deuterium fractionation with the co depletion factor was given in @xcite using the ratio of d@xmath0co over h@xmath0co in a sample of five cores .",
    "although d@xmath0co and h@xmath0co have been shown to deplete in the inner nucleus of the pre ",
    "stellar cores @xcite and hence do not trace the very inner nucleus , these five cores ( included in our sample ) showed a good correlation between the co depletion and the deuterium fractionation in h@xmath0co with the exception of ophd .",
    "another possible test is to check for a correlation between the co depletion factor and the deuterium fractionation within a given core .",
    "this test was performed in @xcite showing again an affirmative answer .",
    "here we searched for a correlation between the integrated co depletion factor and the deuterium fractionation in a subsample of 14 cores using the high density gas tracers n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1  to derive the deuterium fractionation .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fdfrfd ] , where we denote by enclosed data points our `` candidate pre ",
    "stellar cores '' , defined for the purpose of this work as having @xmath2  @xmath79 .",
    "the correlation is not extremely tight ( correlation coefficient 69% ; 74% if only taurus cores are considered ) , but indeed we can say that the cores that show higher co depletions do also show higher deuterium fractionation .",
    "as in @xcite , ophd seems to have `` too much '' deuterium fractionation compared to the co depletion .    in figure  [ fdfrfd ]",
    "we also show theoretical curves from simple chemical models based on that described by @xcite .",
    "these models all assume that the gas and dust temperatures are constant across the core and equal to 10 k. the chemical network and chemical parameters are also the same in all the models : apart from h@xmath3 , the chemical network contains the three neutral species co , n@xmath3 , and o , which can freeze  out onto dust grains and return to the gas phase via thermal desorption or cosmic  ray impulsive heating ( following the formulation of * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the abundances of the molecular ions ( n@xmath0h@xmath1 , hco@xmath1 , h@xmath80o@xmath17 , h@xmath19   and their ( multiply ) deuterated counterparts ) are calculated in terms of the instantaneous abundances of the neutral species .",
    "this simplification is based on the fact that the `` ion chemistry '' timescale is much shorter than the depletion timescale ( see @xcite and @xcitefor details ) .",
    "here we included the multiply deuterated forms of h@xmath19 , without any distinction between the ortho and para forms of molecular hydrogen and h@xmath16d@xmath17   and without taking into account the so  called back - reactions between , e.g. , ortho ",

    "we remark that our calculations assume the steady state and thus our model makes use of the density profile only , and not of the time scale .",
    "we also note that the cb00 model has cylindrical ( rather than spherical ) symmetry and we have neglected this fact assuming the same dependence on spherical radius as that on cylindrical radius in cb00 .",
    "we assume that the density profiles are given by the analytical formula of @xcite , with different values of the parameters ( namely , the central density , the radius of the inner flat region , and the asymptotic power index ) to approximately reproduce the density profiles of figure  1a of cb00 . in particular , the central densities of the cores at each time are given by 10@xmath98  @xmath7   ( for @xmath99 = 1 , ... ,",

    "in particular , we expect magnetic field strength , amount of turbulence , external radiation field and external pressure to influence the evolution of a core .",

    "considering now only this common subsample , @xcite found that 12 of these cores show infall signatures in at least three of the seven tests they performed on cs , dco@xmath1  and n@xmath0h@xmath1 lines , thus they are considered strong infall candidates .",

    "this seems to show that our chemically evolved candidates , the majority of which show clear signs of central infall , are a subsample of the cores undergoing extended contraction .",
    "we also performed a direct comparison between one of the infall indicators in @xcite , @xmath104v@xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , and our n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) skewness on a common subsample of 15 cores .",
    "we find a very good agreement between those two parameters with only two cases in which they give a different indication : l429 which has significant outflow signature in the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) skewness but marginal infall indication in @xmath104v@xmath105 , and l183 , which has a very strong outflow behaviour in @xmath104v@xmath105 whereas it shows an infall profile in our n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) spectrum .",
    "for the 13 remaining cores the two indicators correlate with a 70% correlation coefficient .",

    "the result is encouraging .",
    "we can in fact see in panel  a ) of figure  [ fdv ] that @xmath70 is anti - correlated with n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) line width ( correlation coefficient 67% ; 86% limiting to taurus cores ) ; note that even cores that in the other plots do not behave like the rest of the sample ( ophd and l328 ) lie here in the common trend .",
    "+ in panel  b ) of figure  [ fdv ] we find that , with the notable exceptions of l328 and l429 , the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) line width correlates fairly well with the h@xmath3  central density ( correlation coefficient 20% for the total sample ; 64% without l328 and l429 ; 94% for only the taurus cores ) .",
    "in the picture given in section  [ dfr_kin ] , the cores with strong motions along the line of sight should show stronger asymmetries and broader lines towards the core peak . in figure  [ fdv ]",
    "panel  c ) we plotted the relation between the width and the skewness of the n@xmath0h@xmath1  line . although again a tight correlation is not found , we can see that there is a general trend of increased skewness in broader spectra .",
    "remarkable exceptions are constituted by ophd and tmc1-c , having narrow lines strongly skewed towards the red , and by l429 and l328 , which have the broadest lines in the sample but do not show any infall asymmetry .",
    "also in this case , limiting the sample to taurus cores , the correlation coefficient increases from 2% to 21% .",
    "the fact that the majority of the cores in our sample ( see figure  [ fcomet ] in section  [ shape ] ) show large departures from spherical symmetry has considerable significance for our understanding of the dynamics of these objects .",
    "core shape could for example reflect the magnetic field structure and indeed several of the cores in our sample show linear polarization of around 5%-10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting magnetic fields of order 100  @xmath58 g . however , the observed structures could also be a consequence of dynamical interactions with the core surroundings as is suggested by the observed `` cometary '' shapes .",
    "it is natural therefore to search for kinematic evidence in our n@xmath0h@xmath1  maps that either excludes or favors one of these scenarios .",
    "there are various possible kinematic probes , including the observed velocity field , but the simplest is to check for a correlation between line width and aspect ratio . here",
    "the interpretation depends considerably on whether the true core shape is `` close to oblate '' or `` close to prolate '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who have attempted to decide this on the basis of the statistics of observed aspect ratios ) .",
    "present results are inconclusive and we conclude that one must consider both possibilities .    in either case , if cores are magnetically dominated , motion along the field lines will be facilitated .",
    "we would expect that in such cases , motions will predominantly be parallel to the axis of symmetry and hence for oblate cores , one might expect the largest line widths for face - on circular sources and for prolate cores for end  on ( also circular ) objects .",
    "on the other hand , ambipolar diffusion necessarily occurs across field lines and this will have the opposite effect .",
    "thus , for example , edge - on oblate cores will have the largest line width .",
    "in fact , cb00 have provided predictions for how the velocity field due to the latter process might appear in l1544 and @xcite showed that the observations were roughly consistent with the model for this object .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case in l1521f @xcite and also not in a more general sample of cores as shown in figure  [ fdv ] panel  d ) , where we plot the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) line width against aspect ratio from the millimeter continuum maps .",
    "there is no clear trend in this plot , and clearly a larger sample is needed .",
    "however , our results do not give evidence that in general there are increased line widths towards elongated core nuclei as one might expect on the basis of models such as those of cb00 .",
    "on the other hand , our results also do not seem to favor the models of @xcite which suggest that initially elongated structures should become more spherical as they evolve owing to ambipolar diffusion .",

    "we do not notice any clear correspondence between a more marked cometary shape and other kinematical properties of the core ( e.g. h@xmath3  density , n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) line - width , or @xmath70 ) . +    using the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) velocities from the hyperfine structure fitting , we found strong velocity variations in l183 ( 0.23  km s@xmath28  in a 0.16  pc length ) and ophd ( 0.19  km s@xmath28 in a 0.12  pc length ) , while a smaller variation ( 0.07  km s@xmath28  in a 0.1  pc length ) was found in l694 - 2 and constant velocity fields were seen in the inner 0.08  pc of l429 and l492 .",
    "we evaluated the total velocity gradients of these cores under the assumption of solid body rotation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitudes and the direction of the velocity gradients are reported in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of table  [ tvg ] .",
    "lccc l183 & 1.4@xmath370.1 & -49@xmath371 & 1.5@xmath370.7 + ophd & 1.6@xmath370.1 & -119@xmath371 & 1.6@xmath371.0 + l694 - 2 & 0.7@xmath370.1 & -18@xmath371 & 0.8@xmath370.3 + l429 & 0.4@xmath370.1 & -33@xmath372 & 1.9@xmath371.1 + l492 & 0.2@xmath370.1 & 83@xmath372 & 1.5@xmath370.8 +    these calculations agree with the velocity variations seen across the cores .",
    "+ local velocity gradients , evaluated in @xmath121 adjacent points , were also calculated towards these cores ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the procedure ) .",
    "the analysis was performed on regridded data and results are shown in figure  [ fvgrad ] and table  [ tvg ] .",
    "l183 and ophd present strong motions and a regular velocity field . l429 and l492 show very little motion in the inner parts but larger gradients at the edge of the map with arrows pointing in different directions on different sides of the cores , explaining the absence of velocity variation in the inner part and the small total velocity gradient .",
    "finally , l694 - 2 shows the smallest local gradients with a regular velocity field only in the inner part .    using the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) and n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) maps",
    ", we also checked for the presence of line width gradients in l694 - 2 , ophd , l183 , l429 and l492 in the same fashion as for l1544 @xcite , b68 @xcite and l1521f @xcite . from figure [ fdvgrad ]",
    "we find that only l694 - 2 shows the line width decrease that was evidenced in l1521f and l1544 , while a marginal similarity is found in the first 50  around ophd and in the northern part of l492 .",
    "the opposite behaviour is seen in l429 and l183 ( as found in b68 ) .",
    "the n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) line widths evidenced the same behaviour as in figure [ fdvgrad ] .",
    "the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation simplifies the radiative transfer treatment assuming that a photon produced in a contracting or expanding cloud is reabsorbed locally and that the local velocity gradient is much larger than the ratio of line width to cloud size . in addition , one normally assumes homogeneous and isothermal conditions . assuming a temperatutre of 10  k",
    ", we have used this approximation , with collisional rates from @xcite to compute level populations for n@xmath0h@xmath1  and n@xmath0d@xmath1  and to predict line intensities for these species as a function of density and species column density .",
    "we then compared the model predictions with the observed n@xmath0h@xmath1(32)/n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) intensity ratio and the n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) integrated intensity ( or the n@xmath0d@xmath1(32)/n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) and n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) intensity ) exploiting the fact that the former is mainly sensitive to @xmath24(h@xmath3 ) and the latter to the n@xmath0h@xmath1(n@xmath0d@xmath1 ) column density .",
    "our results are extremely sensitive to the intensity of the two 32 transitions and we hence confine our discussion to the eight cores with s / n@xmath122 in the 1  mm lines .",
    "an extra constraint comes from the total @xmath40 of n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) ( n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) ) .",
    "note that , given the small opacities found in n@xmath0d@xmath1(21 ) ( and in many n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) spectra ) , @xmath40 has little influence on the @xmath24(h@xmath3 ) determination whereas it is a useful constraint for column density .    in table",
    "[ tlvg ] we summarize the results of the lvg calculations .",
    "the ratio of the n@xmath0h@xmath1to n@xmath0d@xmath1  column densities inferred from lvg and the relative value found in the ctex approximation have an arithmetic mean value of 0.9 and a dispersion of 25% .",
    "thus , the lvg results are consistent with the column densities derived assuming a constant rotational temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath3  densities derived from the molecular data are systematically smaller ( a factor of @xmath68 ) than those derived from the dust observations ( see figure  [ fnh2lvg ] ) .",
    "l|cc|cc l1521f & 1.3 & 3.4 & 4.5 & 1.6 + tmc2 & 1.7 & 1.0 & 1.5 & 1.5 + l1544 & 1.5 & 2.8 & 2.8 & 4.6 + l183 & 1.0 & 2.0 & 3.5 & 2.8 + ophd & 3.2 & 0.6 & 4.0 & 2.6 + b68 & 0.6 & 1.2 & & + l429 & 1.6 & 3.1 & 4.3 & 4.9 + l694 - 2 & 1.1 & 2.1 & 2.2 & 3.3 +    the differences between the two determinations diminish in the low - density cores ( a factor of @xmath123 ) .",
    "these differences may partially be due to our assumptions concerning the dust millimeter opacity and temperature ( see @xcite @xcite for a discussion of the latter and @xcite @xcite for a discussion of the former ) .",
    "another possibility is that depletion of n@xmath16 ( and hence of n@xmath0h@xmath1   and n@xmath0d@xmath1 ) may occur in regions with density higher than @xmath23  @xmath7   ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case , one would expect differences between maps of n@xmath0h@xmath1  and dust continuum ( one possible example could be l183 , see section  [ maps ] ) .",
    "we note also that there is a hint in our data that densities derived from n@xmath0d@xmath1  are systematically higher than those from n@xmath0h@xmath1  and this again may be consistent with a hole caused by n@xmath16 freeze  out .",
    "however , we stress that these trends need confirmation and that measurements with higher sensitivity and angular resolution are needed .",
