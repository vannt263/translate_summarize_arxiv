    "afterglow emission , spanning from radio to x - ray , and observable from minutes to weeks after the event , appears to be a ubiquitous feature of long - duration gamma - ray burst explosions .",
    "afterglows result from radiation emitted by electrons accelerated in a relativistic shock produced by the explosion of a progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the shock propagates outward into the surrounding medium , the resulting broadband synchrotron radiation evolves in a manner dependent on a number of fundamental characteristics of the explosion , as well as on the details of the shock evolution and the density profile of the medium it expands into ( for a review of the theory , see * ? ? ?",
    "the physics of relativistic shocks , the mechanism of collisionless shock acceleration , and the means by which magnetic fields can be amplified to levels needed to produce the observed synchrotron emission are poorly understood .",
    "basic understanding of these elements will eventually result from improved magnetohydrodynamic simulations , which may ultimately prescribe such factors as the appropriate electron energy distribution , what fraction of shock energy goes into magnetic field , and how this evolves with the shock expansion .",
    "additional uncertainties arise from the fact that the outflow geometry , and the structure of the circumburst medium are unobservable , and could potentially be complex .    in spite of the lack of detailed understanding ,",
    "the basic features of the grb afterglow can be described by relatively simple theoretical models for the outflow and shock ( e.g. with relativistic flow as in * ? ? ?",
    "simple assumptions about the shock microphysics and geometry appear to fit the basic features of the afterglow in a number of cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , many events appear consistent with the expansion of the shock into a medium with either a constant or a simple @xmath5 powerlaw in density .",
    "ideally , high - quality broadband afterglow observations , interpreted in the context of basic theoretical models , could be used to constrain the explosion parameters , geometry , and the structure of the surrounding medium .",
    "in addition , if the data are of sufficiently high quality , it should be possible to test the validity of the basic model assumptions ; or at least the range over which they may be varied and still describe the data . given a relatively large number of model parameters , however , only a few data sets are of sufficient quality to provide interesting constraints .",
    "in this paper , we examine four high - quality broadband afterglow data sets , fitting them to a basic afterglow model .",
    "we investigate the similarity of the derived explosion , shock , and environmental parameters .",
    "in addition , we investigate selected model assumptions and the range over which they can be varied . in particular",
    ", we consider whether the fraction of energy in the post - shock magnetic field can evolve as some power of the bulk lorentz factor , and the range of possible matter density gradients .",
    "finally , we consider which future observations provide the most promise for better constraining both the model and its physical parameters .",
    "we adopt a standard fireball scenario for the grb afterglow , where a relativistic shock with lorentz factor @xmath0 expands into the circumburst medium ( cbm ) .",
    "@xcite describes the flow .",
    "the shock may be spherical or initially confined to a cone ( i.e. , be jet - like ) .",
    "the afterglow flux arises from the radiation ( synchrotron and possibly also inverse compton ) emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated in the shock . to describe its evolution we model the shock dynamics , adopting assumptions for the density profile of the cbm , the shock geometry , and the shock microphysics including the distribution of electron energies , as described below .",
    "we also account for the effects of the medium through which the radiation passes en route to the observer .      for the dynamics , we make simple assumptions about the event s geometry and environment .",
    "we consider a constant circumburst matter density @xmath7 , the `` ism - like '' case , as well as the possibility the cbm could be dominated by a wind outflow from the progenitor . as a constant mass - loss rate and wind speed gives an @xmath5 profile , we consider this the `` wind - like '' case . into either cbm form",
    "we allow for isotropy or a simple collimation of the ejecta , a top - hat distribution in solid angle with half - opening angle @xmath8 .",
    "the shock behaves as though isotropic until it slows down sufficiently to expand in its rest frame @xcite .",
    "we calculate the time @xmath9 at which collimation is evident as @xmath8 = 1/@xmath0 ( @xmath0 the shock lorentz factor ; this assumes the observer is nearly along the line of sight ) .",
    "we calculate the expected radiative losses , which can modify the shock dynamics @xcite , in the manner detailed further below .    for the microphysics governing the emission it is standard to assume several things .",
    "first , that the shock imparts a constant fraction of its energy ( @xmath10 ) to the swept - up electrons , and a constant fraction ( @xmath1 ) goes into amplifying magnetic fields .",
    "these fractions are capped at 100% , where all the shock s energy would be in one of these .",
    "a reasonable limit could have been the ejecta-@xmath10-@xmath1 equipartition value of 33% , but the model s calculations are not perfectly known .",
    "the equations used have some uncertainties ; we allow each of @xmath10 and @xmath1 to vary up to the limit of taking all the shock energy .",
    "it is also assumed that the electrons are accelerated into a simple powerlaw distribution of energies above a minimum value ( p(@xmath11)@xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , with a constant index @xmath14 .",
    "these are our basic assumptions for the fireball model",
    ". they will be tested in further sections .      given this electron spectrum ,",
    "we get a broken powerlaw radiation spectrum , with three break frequencies that evolve in a manner that depends upon the dynamics @xcite : the injection break @xmath15 for the minimal energy of the radiating electrons , the cooling break @xmath16 corresponding to energies at which radiative losses over the shock s lifetime are significant and the self - absorption break @xmath17 where the spectrum becomes optically thick at low frequencies .",
    "if the minimum energy electrons emit at a peak frequency above the self - absorbed regime , the spectrum below @xmath17 is @xmath18 , ressembling a blackbody with effective temperature corresponding to that minimum energy ; if electrons are emitting within the optically thick regime , the effective temperature is a function of frequency and the spectrum is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we use a smooth shape with factors of ( 1 + @xmath20)@xmath21 ( @xmath22 are the indices before and after the break ) for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 we use the physically motivated prescription of @xcite .    for the model with basic assumptions",
    "we employ the previously published fireball model calculations for the spectral breaks .",
    "the isotropic case is taken from @xcite s relativistic near - adiabatic case , with normalizations from @xcite ( their canonical order , table 2 ) for a wind - like cbm , and from @xcite for an ism - like cbm",
    ". these normalizations account for the post - shock spatial distribution of electrons and emission from equal arrival - time surfaces .",
    "the resulting equations are :    @xmath23    for the ism - like cbm , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for the wind - like cbm : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the units are : @xmath28 = luminosity distance in 10@xmath29  cm , @xmath30 = @xmath1 in % , @xmath7 = density in @xmath31 , @xmath32 = density scaling for the wind - like profile so that @xmath33  g@xmath34cm@xmath21 ( @xmath36 in cm ; a standard reference for a mass loss of 10@xmath37m@xmath38yr@xmath21 at a wind speed of 1000 km@xmath34s@xmath21 ) , @xmath39 = isotropic - equivalent energy in units of 10@xmath40  ergs , @xmath41 = observed time post - burst in days .",
    "the electron energy partition @xmath10 is given as a fraction .",
    "the post-@xmath9 evolution with laterally expanding ejecta uses the time - dependences of @xcite ( eqs . 2 - 5 ) , and is connected to the pre - jet behaviour without smoothing ( i.e. , a sharp jet break ) .    using the relativistic equations for the shock energy , @xmath42",
    ", we calculate the time at which @xmath43 as the nonrelativistic transition , @xmath44 . this would be equivalent to using the @xcite approximation for the energy , @xmath45 , and defining the nonrelativistic transition condition as @xmath46 .",
    "we again employ a sharp transition to the post-@xmath44 behaviour .",
    "we adjust this evolving synchrotron spectrum with self - consistent corrections to the cooling rate , based upon the parameters already enumerated .",
    "we calculate the effects of synchrotron photon upscatters ( inverse compton scatters , ic ) off the shocked electrons as in @xcite . when ic dominates the cooling we adjust the cooling break @xmath16 ( by @xmath47 when @xmath48 ; @xmath49 the ic to synchrotron luminosity ratio @xmath50 ( max[@xmath51,1]@xmath52)@xmath53 ) .",
    "the upscattered photons can produce a high - frequency secondary source of flux ; for it we adopt the spectral breaks as in @xcite and use our synchrotron spectral shape ( a good approximation except for an ignored logarithmic correction between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the slope for @xmath56 , where ic never dominates the data ) .",
    "we also treat radiative corrections self - consistently , from the model parameters .",
    "instantaneously , we treat the shock as adiabatic .",
    "the energy is calculated for each time from the solution of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "it depends upon the ratio @xmath58 in slow cooling ( @xmath59 ) as the losses quench out and we use the synchrotron - only rate of change in @xmath16 , allowing a simple analytic solution for @xmath60 .",
    "as this is when @xmath60 changes are becoming unimportant , the approximation has little effect .",
    "we scale the shock s energy to the value at the change from fast- to slow - cooling regimes ( @xmath61 , fairly early ) .",
    "this spectrum is modified on the way to the observer , and we must account for extinction , interstellar scintillation ( iss ) and the host s flux .",
    "iss in the galaxy distorts the flux at low ( radio ) frequencies ; we estimate its fractional flux variations as outlined in @xcite for point sources , using the map of scattering strengths by @xcite , and scalings for extended sources as explained in @xcite .",
    "the growing angular size quenches the scintillations ; we assume initial parameters in the model to get angular size as a function of time for the iss model .",
    "these are not iterated , but used as an additional uncertainty in the _ model _ flux , added in quadrature to the data s uncertainties when estimating @xmath62 .    for extinction",
    ", we first deredden for galactic effects using @xcite s method for estimating a@xmath63 in the optical .",
    "as most grbs are at high galactic latitudes , this term is small .",
    "then , as the extinction curves in high-@xmath64 galaxies are unknown , we use known local extinction curves redshifted to the host restframe to fit for host contributions .",
    "we use @xcite s large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in general , but for the grb 980329 event we used the small magellanic cloud bar s law due to evidence that the host s extinction law is steep .",
    "we do not subtract host fluxes as the decay slope is sensitive to small differences in the host value ; host fluxes are added to the model in the fit . in the optical and near - ir ,",
    "when there is evidence for a host component , we fit a value for the particular band(s ) involved .",
    "as submillimeter hosts have been detected in other bursts @xcite , we allowed for this possibility ( scaled to 350 ghz as @xmath65 ) , but none was required for the four events under consideration and this component was not included in the best fits . finally , we see in 2 datasets evidence for underlying flux in the radio .",
    "980703 has sufficient data that a spectral index ( -0.32 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was determined and we fit the radio host flux scaled to 1.43 ghz ( where it is brightest ) . for 980329",
    "we use a canonical spectral index of @xmath66 , again scaled to 1.43 ghz .",
    "two other groups have performed full analyses similar to ours , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are some differences in each group s approach to the fireball model .",
    "chevalier & li develop an @xmath5 cbm model , including analytic solutions to the hydrodynamics , but they do a numerical solution to get the full smooth spectral shape .",
    "they assume an extra break in the electron energy distribution but do not , however , account for energy losses , ic cooling or iss effects .",
    "panaitescu & kumar numerically solve the dynamics ( whereas we use analytic asymptotic forms ) , numerically calculate the spectrum from equal arrival - time surfaces ( whereas we use equations adjusted to account for equal arrival - time surfaces and the electron distribution behind the shock , and a simple smoothing ) and calculate ic scatters and energy losses directly from the model s radiated spectrum ( whereas we use the theoretically expected levels from the parameters ) .",
    "they use the simplest electron energy distribution when it provides a good solution but also allow for two ( rather than one ) indices in the injected spectrum if needed .",
    "they pre - account for host effects by subtracting fluxes and fixing extinction levels , instead of including these in the fits .",
    "we selected four events with rich datasets ( radio , optical - nir and x - ray at a minimum ) for which the fireball model with simple assumptions provides a good description of the lightcurves .",
    "these are grb  970508 , detected by the _",

    "the summaries presented here chiefly point the reader to the relevant papers .",
    "as we have not compiled the 970508 data elsewhere , we provide full details here .",
    "grb  970508 was the second burst with a detected afterglow , and it has a rich broadband dataset .",
    "we use the x - ray fluxes of @xcite , converting to flux densities and frequency assuming @xmath67 over their quoted band . for the optical / nir , we use bvi data from @xcite and @xcite , r from the table compiled in @xcite , and k@xmath68 from @xcite .",
    "we converted magnitudes to flux densities with the information in @xcite for k@xmath68 and @xcite for bvri .",
    "we included the 12-@xmath69 m mid - ir measurement by @xcite .",
    "we used @xcite in the submillimeter ( 86 & 232 ghz ) , and the 15 ghz data of @xcite and the 1.43 , 4.86 and 8.46 ghz dataset of @xcite in the radio .",
    "grb 970508 s afterglow was unusual - a sudden brightening in ( at least ) the optical occurred at @xmath70 1 day , followed by the usual powerlaw decays at @xmath71 days , and the dataset shows an intrinsic `` scatter '' even at later times in at least the optical and radio .",
    "no simple model can account for the rise .",
    "various possible explanations for a sudden rise in afterglow flux include a refreshed shock from slower material in the relativistic flow catching up to the slowing forward shock @xcite , a sudden jump in the encountered density @xcite , or even the `` patchy shell '' model where there are hot and cold spots in the shock and as the shell slows a hot spot may come into the observable area @xcite .",
    "these models can provide a single rise that will not affect the emission substantially later .",
    "to avoid such complications we used only the data at @xmath71 days , after the rise , for the modelling dataset .",
    "the 980329 event has data in the x - ray , optical , submillimeter and radio regimes .",
    "initial searches in the optical were unsuccessful , and @xcite first identified the afterglow in the radio .",
    "early epoch optical data where the afterglow dominates over host emission is therefore somewhat sparse . the excess @xmath72  days emission at 8.46 ghz is thought to be due to a reverse shock @xcite and therefore we excluded it from our analysis .",
    "@xcite gives full details concerning the dataset .",
    "no redshift has been determinable for this event ( the only such case in our sample ) due to faint host emission and a lack of prominent emission lines ; we adopt z=2 here , roughly the middle of the potential redshift range .",
    "the 980703 afterglow data includes radio , optical / nir ( with good frequency coverage : bvrijhk ) and x - ray .",
    "the utility of the opt - nir data is limited to a few days postburst by a bright host ( which is also visible in the late radio data ) .",

    "the 000926 afterglow data includes radio data from 1.43 to 98 ghz , ground - based and _ hst _ optical and nir observations and _ chandra _ x - ray observations . the first 8.46 ghz point ( @xmath50 1.2 days postburst ) was excluded from the analysis as abnormally high and possibly associated with reverse shock emission",
    "we use all available bvrhk data and divide the x - ray into a soft and a hard band .",
    "this is further described in @xcite .",
    "970508 shows a `` scatter '' in its lightcurves in all frequency regimes and timescales .",
    "it is not clear how much of the scatter may be due to real physical effects ( such as clumpiness in the circumburst medium ) , and how much could be attributed to cross - calibration uncertainties . while we performed our fits as in ",

    "( we do not attempt an analysis with increased error bars to reduce @xmath62 to the dof , as this would require much larger uncertainties . )",
    "we have adopted this fit , a nearly - isotropic solution ( @xmath73  days ) with an ism - like cbm of somewhat low density ( 0.2 @xmath31 ) and @xmath10 and @xmath1 near equipartition , as our best solution .",
    "@xcite fit 980329 as detailed in ",
    "[ sec : framework ] .",
    "our best model is collimated , with a significant density ( n @xmath70 20 @xmath31 ) and host extinction .",
    "we found no need for a submillimeter host component , and that a radio host improves the fit with marginal significance .",
    "the best fit was not a unique solution ; @xcite noted an isotropic , extremely radiative ( _ all _ the shock s energy in radiating electrons ) solution fit as well .",
    "we reject that solution on the basis of its unphysical parameters .",
    "@xcite gives results of 980703 s fits as in ",
    "[ sec : framework ] .",
    "the best fit is a collimated jet into a constant density cbm , its jet break hidden in the optical by the host s dominance .",
    "it was not a unique solution ; a collimated jet in an @xmath5 cbm fit the data equally well .",
    "that fit required extreme parameters : 70% of the shock s energy is imparted to the electrons and the energy during the afterglow is @xmath74 1/10 that of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission , requiring an extremely high @xmath0-ray conversion efficiency .",
    "we reject the @xmath5 fit .",
    "the model we employ (  [ sec : framework ] ) for the 000926 fits has changed since the work done in @xcite . before , estimated host fluxes were subtracted instead of fitted for . as there was a galaxy `` arc '' nearby contaminating the ground - based data , the host components fitted for are merely the persistent underlying flux common to both ground- and space - based observations ; the `` arc '' flux removal remains as before . moreover",
    ", the model now employs radiative corrections to the energy , which were not yet incorporated in the previous analysis .",
    "we refit the dataset ; the best fit from the improved model is in table [ tab : bestfits ] .",
    "it is still a high - ic ism model with a substantial density , but the @xmath62 has increased .",
    "the previous fit had a nonnegligeable @xmath10 and no radiative corrections ; with radiative corrections correlated with @xmath10 , these are incompatible , @xmath10 drops and the fit worsens . in particular",
    ", while the x - ray still requires flux above the synchrotron s level , the parameter changes cause the ic flux estimate to no longer match the data as well .",
    "table [ tab : bestfits ] presents the best fits using the basic assumptions described in  [ sec : basicmodel ] ( also see figure [ fig : bestpars ] ) .",
    "the table includes statistical 68.3% confidence intervals for the parameters , calculated from ( non - gaussian ) distribution histograms generated by over 1000 monte carlo bootstraps .",
    "the results show a great deal of diversity in the values , similar to other efforts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fits can be seen in figures [ fig_bestopt ] , [ fig_best8ghz ] , [ fig_bestx ] .",
    "neither the variation in nor the values of the energy / geometry and environmental parameters is surprising . variation is seen in the energies of the prompt grb emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , if grbs are related to the deaths of massive stars ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) then we would not expect such parameters to be identical due to variations in progenitor mass , angular momentum and environment .",
    "the densities are comparable to the milky way s ism density at the low end , and to the density of diffuse clouds for the three @xmath70 20 @xmath31 , typical of other efforts with significant radio data ( which constrains the synchrotron self - absorption ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the values are not inconsistent with the core - collapse grb progenitor hypothesis , despite the expectation of a stellar birth environment , and molecular cloud cores having @xmath75 @xmath31 .",
    "diffuse clouds are also associated with star - forming regions , and such densities are found in the interclump medium that dominates molecular cloud volumes in the galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and its references ) . moreover , massive stars modify their environment making direct interactions with the dense cloud cores unlikely @xcite",
    ".    the total kinetic energies inferred in the fits ( 10@xmath76 - 10@xmath40  ergs ) are roughly comparable , though at the high end , with the range of total @xmath0-ray energies expected from the studies by @xcite . on a case - by - case basis , we check if they are reasonable by comparison with the @xmath0-ray energies , employing the isotropic - equivalent k - corrected 20 - 2000 kev fluences of @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the isotropic - equivalent kinetic ( at 1 day post - burst ) and @xmath0 ( over the grb ) energies varies from 0.5 to 5 .",
    "however , the modelled energy corrections would give fireball energies 3 to 10 times higher at the end of the burst ; the implied @xmath0-ray efficiency would then be 3 - 10% in three cases , and 40% for grb  000926 .",
    "the lower efficiency values are quite compatible with theoretical expectations ; 000926 s is near the high end of the predictions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the environmental and energy parameters are quite reasonable in the present framework .",
    "what is somewhat unexpected is the lack of universality in the microphysical parameters .",
    "values of @xmath10 are fairly uniform , only varying by a factor of 2 , but the values of @xmath1 vary by a factor of 100 .",
    "the index @xmath14 is expected to be in the range of 2.2 - 2.3 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but its values span from 2.1 to 2.9 . while relativistic shocks are not well - understood ( neither fully modelled from first principles , nor measured in the lab ) , the physics occurring at a shock boundary should only be a function of the shock strength , or equivalently here for a relativistic shock , its lorentz factor .",
    "a spread by two decades in @xmath1 would therefore be unexpected if everything is properly accounted for in the model .",
    "we would expect the microphysical parameters to be near - universal .",
    "if the spread in the microphysical parameters does indeed exist then highly relativistic shocks behave nonintuitively .",
    "( however , the apparent spread could be due to the overall uncertainty in the model , a parameter such as the viewing angle that is not fully accounted for or nonuniqueness of the model fits . )",
    "we have already noted that there are at least two nonunique fits : grb  980329 with a highly radiative fit , and grb  980703 with an @xmath5 density profile fit disfavoured due to extreme parameters .",
    "this leaves open the question as to whether there may be equally good fits with reasonable parameters ( perhaps under other model assumptions ) .",
    "it is therefore important to check if the model , with the very simple assumptions we have employed , is constrained only to these fits by the data .",
    "the assumptions could be too simple , and the following section explores fits with other model assumptions in order to constrain some interesting aspects of the model uncertainty .",
    "above , we found good fits even with simple assumptions .",
    "but without quantifying the uncertainty in model assumptions , it is not clear if this says anything about the simplicity of the underlying physical processes or the environment .",
    "we do not know if fits are possible with a variety of underlying assumptions , and whether that would substantially change the parameters inferred .",
    "we now investigate the range of allowed modifications on a limited set of fireball model assumptions , and the effect of modified assumptions on the parameters in good fits .",
    "first , the magnetic field amplification ( assumed to be from instabilities ) is not well understood - we do not know from first principles whether the fields pile up , decay away or reach a steady state .",
    "there is also a spread in the magnetic energy fraction @xmath1 ( by a factor of more than 100 ) .",
    "so the behaviour of the magnetic fields is clearly one of the important questions surrounding the microphysics of relativistic shocks .",
    "we want to learn whether it is possible for the field energy to evolve with the strength of the shock in the afterglow phase , and if the data truly constrains the interesting diversity seen in the best fit values .",
    "to get some constraint on this  [ sec : epbofx ] explores whether an evolving @xmath1 could fit the data .",
    "second , we know there is at least one case where more than one density profile can produce a good fit (  [ sec : prevfits ] ) .",
    "there is also a growing body of evidence that grbs are associated with star - forming regions and may be the result of the collapse of massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if correct , the shock should be propagating into a medium enriched by the stellar wind of the progenitor , and the density profile should not be constant .",
    "however , the best fits are for a constant - density medium .",
    "we want a constraint on how sensitive the fits are to density profile , and so we investigate a wider variety of density profiles ( @xmath77 ) than the two previously considered , in  [ sec : n_ofr ] .",
    "the strength of the magnetic fields implied in the fireball model are far stronger than the levels expected from the strength of the galactic fields .",
    "the relativistic shock is expected to amplify the nearby fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this would be a nonlinear process acting on small instabilities ; the resulting fields would depend on the amplification mechanism and not on the initial values .",
    "this aspect of relativistic shock physics is not fully understood ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "grb afterglow emission can be used to investigate this process ; @xcite show that spectra will differ if the magnetic field is confined to a small length behind the shock . the importance of magnetic fields in grbs is further demonstrated by @xcite s recent detection of linear polarization at the theoretical maximum in the prompt emission of grb 021206 .",
    "this would require a uniform magnetic field across the @xmath0-ray emission region beamed to the observer , potentially implying that magnetic fields dominate the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the magnetic energy fraction @xmath1 imparted by the shock amplification is constant is the simplest assumption ; shock physics could depend on the mach number ( equivalently the lorentz factor if relativistic ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that the shock would have different efficiencies with time , and the fitted number is simply some averaging over where its modelled effect on the data is strongest",
    ". it would also be possible to get effectively an increase or decrease in @xmath1 if the pileup of magnetic fields behind the shock in the place where the electrons are accelerated and radiate does not reach a steady state - if the fields remain and grow it would increase and if they diffuse away faster than they are replenished it would decrease .",
    "( it is also therefore possible that the pileup could be position - dependent , even if there is a universal behaviour for a collimated flow , and some disparities could be due to the unaccounted - for differences in viewing angle . )",
    "it is important to constrain whether the data _ allows _ a variable @xmath1 to see if such explanations are viable , and its spread could be due to model uncertainty . if the @xmath1 disparities could be resolved with a universal nonconstant @xmath1 behaviour that would be of significant interest .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 s behaviour is nonconstant , the values fitted with the simple constant assumption could be different from the real magnetic fraction ; the level of this effect should be checked . and",
    "if only a growing @xmath1 ( pileup of field energy as the shock strength drops ) or a falling @xmath1 ( drop in the field energy as the shock strength drops ) are allowed by the data , this would be a clue to the unknown details of relativistic shock s field amplification .",

    "we also fit from grids of selected parameter starting points at a particular ( integer ) @xmath93 .",

    "the improvement is seen in 3 of the 4 cases , while the fit with the @xmath106 model assumption to 970508 is only 1% worse in the total broadband @xmath62 than the basic , constant-@xmath1 fit .",
    "the effect of the @xmath106 assumption on the fit to optical and x - ray data is minor .",
    "it takes a long time baseline , as in the radio , to see the spectral evolution differences ; moreover the optical and x - ray are above the cooling frequency and thus have a lesser flux dependence upon @xmath1 ( table [ tab : epbx_fnu ] ) . assuming @xmath107 improves the radio fits - the magnetic energy grows as the shock slows , which allows the peak to rise , flattening the late time decay , as shown in figure [ fig : bestx.8ghz.comp ] .",
    "we note there appears to be a general trend that the radio decays are a bit shallower than the optical / x - ray , so an increasing magnetic energy improves the fit .",
    "there are other possible causes ; any effect that increases the peak flux , such as an increasing energy or density , will flatten the radio decay .    for a sufficiently steep @xmath2 ; @xmath108 the resulting model behaviour can no longer fit the datasets despite any compensating changes in other parameters . as the peak flux @xmath109 , one of the chief spectral behaviour changes is that the peak flux drops , producing steeper decays ( see table [ tab : epbx_fnu ] ) .",
    "this leads to a poor radio fit by @xmath110 , often with the radio peak flux too low in order to give an appropriate earlier peak flux relative to the optical data .",
    "the effect is stronger post - jet , and as shown in table [ tab : epbx_bestfits ] the data for 000926 ( with a clear jet break in the optical @xmath50  2 days ) does not even produce a good fit assuming @xmath111 .",
    "the extra steepening in the radio requires a later jet break than is compatible with the optical ; attempts were made to compensate in fits with @xmath112 days , but the radio could not be forced to fit .",
    "there can also be some fit difficulties at higher frequencies ; these may be due to a drop in ic flux components for higher early @xmath1 , or a change in the spectral slope from its link to the decay rates .",
    "these effects also combine ; a decreased ic flux in the x - ray requires an increased synchrotron flux . in some models",
    "it is produced by overproducing the model s optical flux and suppressing it with host extinction .",
    "the combination does not produce appropriate spectral indices both in the optical and from the optical to the x - ray .",
    "while the @xmath106 assumption produced improved fits , for a negative enough @xmath93 , @xmath2 can no longer match the data , at @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath114 , @xmath1 will become unphysically high , capping at 100% , even with a reasonable early value .",
    "this occurs at @xmath115 for 980329 , where no good fit can be found with @xmath116 in the data range ; early radio flux would decline rather than rising , in contradiction to the data ( see table [ tab : epbx_fnu ] ) .",
    "however , the others can not fit before reaching that extreme .",
    "by @xmath84 , 980703 s radio peak can not be matched .",
    "the peak frequency drops so slowly that it does not pass until quite late ; a decline is produced post - jet ( so too early ) by pushing @xmath117 to maximize the energy losses .",
    "this unphysical result is also required to counteract the shallow decay at optical and x - ray frequencies .",
    "970508 fits poorly in a similar manner , but 000926 s poor fit is again due to the definite optical break . with ic cooling dominant , the pre - jet flux is too shallow , so the jet break is pushed back earlier than the data , with a break due to the steepening associated with the change to synchrotron cooling dominance which does not match the data well .    in summary , the data does not constrain the fireball model to have a constant magnetic energy fraction @xmath1 .",
    "good fits are possible with both increasing and decreasing @xmath1 , generally as strongly as @xmath118 through @xmath119 . with @xmath0 changing by a factor @xmath70 10 over the data",
    "range , this allows an extra change in magnetic field strength by a factor of @xmath703 - 10 .",
    "moreover the increasing magnetic energy with @xmath120 tends to improve the model fit to the radio data .",
    "as @xmath121 , a more constant level @xmath122 fits slightly better than the basic model .",

    "this includes the changes to the radiative loss estimates , as in @xcite .",
    "there are no general calculated adjustments in the equation normalizations accounting for the postshock electron distribution with a generic density profile , so we used the order of magnitude estimates ( including for @xmath0 , which gives @xmath9 ) , and the estimate that from the jet expansion @xmath125 .    we expect cases of @xmath126 to help constrain how sensitive the model is to the details of a mass - loss wind from the supposed progenitor star",

    "it offers insight into the behaviour when hitting the edge of a very dense , but not sharp , shell surrounding the burst .",
    "it does not directly model the extinction column from the material , so the density would have to cut off before the material ahead would absorb all the light emitted from the shock .",

    "when @xmath132 , it is multiplied by @xmath91 ; other orderings have other factors .",
    "@xmath133    an increasing density ( @xmath130 ) does not change the behaviour as greatly as a rarefaction ( @xmath126 ) . with the converse ,",
    "rapid changes are expected for decreasing @xmath126 , not increasing @xmath130 .",
    "the reasons are illustrated by the range in densities probed and the rate at which the shock @xmath0 slows depend upon a density profile .",
    "taking the observer time @xmath134 affected by relativistic beaming , and the relativistic energy , @xmath42 ( c=1 ) , with @xmath135 from the density profile @xmath136 the results are @xmath137 solving for @xmath36 gives @xmath138 as evident from the above equation , for @xmath139  a few the rate at which density @xmath7 increases with _ observer time _ is weakly dependent upon @xmath124 , despite its strong dependence on radius .",
    "as well , in the adiabatic approximation , with @xmath140 constant @xmath141 for @xmath142 , the rate of slowing only varies from from @xmath143 to @xmath144 ; it depends quite weakly on the density profile for @xmath124 larger than a few .",
    "moreover , in our model , the post - jet shock evolution is not sensitive to density ( since it is stopped and expands laterally ) until the nonrelativistic transition .",
    "changes in the parameters to maintain the same jet break for different @xmath124 may make the nonrelativistic transition come at a somewhat different time , but the effect is not dramatic . the question becomes whether the model with a given @xmath124 can reproduce the behaviour pre - jet . to examine this , we choose the two datasets with sufficient data for well constrained jet break times .",
    "grb 970508 , which was well fit with near - isotropy , and grb 000926 , with a sharp jet break seen in the optical , are most useful to constrain possible model fits for various @xmath124 .",
    "the others had more limited optical data , where jet breaks are generally most obvious , as it was either sparsely sampled or partly masked by a bright host .",
    "( in  [ sec : prevfits ] we note that the grb 980703 dataset could be fit equally well by ism and wind - like density profiles ; clearly at least some very good datasets do not constrain @xmath145 . )",
    "we have seen cases where @xmath146 densities can fit the data , but it is difficult to even marginally fit models with as steep a gradient as @xmath6 ( see the best fits in table [ tab : nofr_fits ] ) . for 000926 , we could not find a satisfactory fit with @xmath6 , as no good fit was possible with a jet break .",
    "the peak flux declines rapidly prejet ; if it scales to fit the early optical it is low by the jet break , then too low in the radio .",
    "the radio model s decay begins too early due to @xmath17 s rapid decline as the shock moves into less dense material .",
    "grb 970508 is also not well fit by @xmath147 .",
    "its @xmath6 model with the best @xmath62 in table [ tab : nofr_fits ] has an unphysical @xmath148 , giving high initial spectral breaks @xmath17 and @xmath15 as these drop quickly .",
    "the peak is high early ( as it drops quickly ) ; the spectrum from the peak to the optical frequencies is steeper than in the ism case . that steepness out to the x - ray frequencies causes that model to underpredict the x - ray flux . the best 970508 model for @xmath6 under the constraint that @xmath116 does not fit the radio data ; its predicted flux rises and falls too sharply as @xmath17 and @xmath15 fall rapidly .",
    "as mentioned above , for an increasing density gradient the shock slows rapidly compared to the constant density case , and the resulting changes in @xmath7 seen by the shock are gradual . as a result , 970508 and 000926",
    "can both be fit with @xmath149 ( table [ tab : nofr_fits ] ) . for 000926",
    ", the increasing density leads to a more rapid nonrelativistic transition , improving the fit somewhat relative to the constant density case .",
    "further changes will go too far ; the fit becomes marginal around @xmath150 where the best fit models overestimate the early radio flux .",
    "970508 has no visible jet break , and is not sensitive to @xmath124 even for values exceeding @xmath151 . pushing to extreme @xmath124 to discover",
    "how far the assumptions can fit the 970508 data ( eventually the gradient would make the nonrelativistic transition come too early ) is of limited value ; grb 970508 s data is not very sensitive to an increasing cbm density gradient .    in summary , while the data may sometimes accomodate an @xmath5 cbm , it does not fit an extreme blown - out density @xmath6 . but a shock plowing into a denser region can not be easily excluded by the data .",
    "this is not the same as a sudden jump in density , but a gradual , continuous increase @xmath123 , for @xmath131 , which is not very realistic but may roughly mimic a dense but not sharp shell of material ( perhaps ejecta from the progenitor ) .",
    "we conclude that the fireball model data fits are not very sensitive to _ increasing _ density gradients .",
    "in previous sections (  [ sec : epbofx ] ,  [ sec : n_ofr ] ) , we found good fits to the data under different assumptions ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ; @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) , as reasonable as the good fits derived from the basic model of  [ sec : basicmodel ] .",
    "the datasets will tolerate widely differing assumptions since the fits need only match up with data over a limited range of frequencies and times , and there are significant degeneracies between parameters and model assumptions .",
    "for example , the decay rate depends upon the spectral index as well as the assumed @xmath145 or @xmath156 . we cross - compared these good fits with those of the basic model , checking spectra from 0.01 to 300 days to see the best ways of distinguishing them .",
    "the fitted models diverge in spectral and temporal regions far from the data , as shown in figures [ xraycomps ] and [ submmcomps ] , which highlight the most promising areas for improved constraints : longer and more sensitive x - ray and submillimeter observations .",
    "x - ray lightcurves of some of the acceptable fits are extended to early times for comparison in figure [ xraycomps ] .",
    "sets of acceptable fits for two events are shown to demonstrate that the fits in all events diverge by factors of up to three at early times ; fluxes of equally acceptable fits may be 3 @xmath69jy or 10 @xmath69jy at 0.01 - 0.03 days .",
    "the sensitivity of _ integral _ s instruments would not be able to distinguish them , but more sensitive x - ray instruments on later @xmath0-ray missions such as _ swift _ may .",
    "figure [ xraycomps ] includes a case with an upscattered ic flux component , whose peak passage timing gives different curvatures to the light curves .",
    "dense , and preferably multifrequency ( the ic peak can be seen in the spectrum ) , x - ray lightcurves would break the degeneracy between synchrotron or ic flux as the x - ray source .",
    "observations of the broadband peak beyond the radio may be most promising .",
    "figure [ submmcomps ] shows examples of the submm lightcurves resulting from various acceptable fits found in this work ; there are a variety of peak levels that subsequently match the radio peak level .",
    "the peak is in the mid - ir or submm for most of the observable afterglow , from about a day to a month . it can rise or fall for a variety of reasons ( energy losses , jet break , @xmath145 , @xmath156 ) , with details dependent upon the assumptions .",
    "these lead to models diverging in submm peak height by up to 10 mjy at fractions of a day ( @xmath50  mjy in the mid - ir ) . improved submm instruments are expected to reach appropriate sensitivities soon .",
    "the _ alma _ array , to be partially on - line by 2006 and completed by 2010 , is expected to give fractional mjy sensitivity in a few minutes .",
    "its observations could seriously constrain the peak s behaviour .",
    "more nir observations will be of use ; in  [ sec : epbofx ] we noted that some fits break down where host extinction and @xmath14 could no longer produce appropriate spectral indices both in the optical and from the optical to the x - ray . with nir data ,",
    "host extinction is better constrained , spectral requirements constrain @xmath14 and allowed model assumptions can be better distinguished by their temporal behaviours for that @xmath14 .",
    "finally , earlier optical observations are becoming available now ( e.g. grb  021004 @xcite , grb  021211 @xcite ) and will be of some use .",
    "however , at such early times the dominant optical emission should not be due to the synchrotron emission from a forward shock into the external medium ; reverse shocks ( as likely seen in the 990123 optical flash , @xcite ) and internal shocks may produce the early optical flux .",
    "this will allow further constraints , but not necessarily to the same parameters .",
    "we may be seeing in grb  021004 that the forward shock dominates only after @xmath50 0.1 days , and the rise of its peak may be masked by the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "thus , the behaviours exhibited by good fits ( under various model assumptions ) to the datasets to date may be distinguishable in the near future , especially by densely sampled x - ray lightcurves , and observations of the peak at frequencies above the radio .",
    "we fit four well - studied bursts with extensive radio through x - ray afterglow datasets to a fireball model with simple assumptions concerning the microphysics and environment .",
    "we find a range of reasonable environmental and geometrical parameters .",
    "we find all four fit best with a constant density medium , one with a value similar to the milky way s ism density , @xmath157@xmath31 , the other three typical of diffuse clouds @xmath158@xmath31 .",
    "their kinetic energies are comparable to the total grb @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "the collimation varies from near - isotropy to a half - angle of 0.04 radians .",
    "we also find a striking diversity in the fitted microphysical parameter values , far beyond the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the electron energy distribution index varies from @xmath159 and the magnetic energy fraction varies from 0.2% to 25%",
    ". as shock physics should depend merely on shock strength , we investigated whether the spread could be due to model uncertainty , but did not find a set of assumptions which fit the data via universal microphysics parameters .",
    "we allowed for changes to be made to the model assumptions : @xmath160 and independently @xmath136 .",
    "we find considerable flexibility in the values of @xmath93 and @xmath124 that can still produce reasonable fits : @xmath2 ; @xmath3 and @xmath123 , with @xmath161 through @xmath162 .",
    "moreover , some parameter values change by up to an order of magnitude when the assumptions underlying the model are altered .",
    "clearly , even the results of very good fits are not unique and the parameters can not be taken at face value .",
    "the model assumptions are not strongly constrained by the datasets available to date . with this model uncertainty ,",
    "the evidence for massive stellar progenitors from other sources ( positions within hosts , possible sn associations , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not hard to reconcile with the lack of clear @xmath163 wind signatures in the best fits .",
    "massive stars may not produce a true @xmath5 profile , or its effect upon the spectrum could be masked by an inaccuracy in other model assumptions .    finally , we compared the spectral evolution of the range of acceptable fits with differing assumptions to identify observational strategies that would produce better constraints .",
    "two areas are most promising .",
    "first , as for now a good fit need only line up with a small time range of x - ray observations , the _ swift _ satellite s expected early , well - sampled x - ray lightcurves will better constrain the spectral evolution ( as well as the ic upscatters of photons to the x - ray band and their consistency with the synchrotron model ) . as well , the peak has only been definitively observed at radio frequencies , passing through the mid - ir and submm during most of the afterglow .",
    "new submm instruments such as _ alma _ should increase the reach of direct peak detections . this will constrain the peak flux evolution , which is sensitive to the model assumptions .    in the future it would be useful to investigate further constraints upon the assumptions .",
    "these might include variable energy @xmath60 ( under investigation in the context of events such as 021004 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the possibility that the electron energy ( parameterized by @xmath10 ) , or their acceleration ( parameterized by the powerlaw index @xmath14 ) , could vary with shock strength .",
