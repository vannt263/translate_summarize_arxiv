    "gaseous response to the bi - symmetric gravitational potential , such as a stellar bar in galaxies , has been well studied numerically since early 70 s @xcite .",
    "a rotating bar - like potential causes resonances in gas orbits , and spiral - like density enhancement or shocks are formed in the gas disk .",
    "however , almost all simulations and analyses in the past three decades assumed a simple model of the interstellar medium ( ism ) with the isothermal equation of state , where the gaseous temperature is assumed a @xmath2 k. in some models , the energy equation is solved , but @xmath3 k cutoff is introduced @xcite . in another major numerical representation of the ism ,",
    "i.e. the `` sticky particle '' method or cloud - fluid model @xcite , the ism particles loose their energy via inelastic collisions , and the velocity dispersion of the particles are kept roughly constant .",
    "the isothermal equation of state or constant velocity dispersion would be a relevant approximation to investigate the global gas dynamics in galaxies .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the interstellar matter is not an isothermal and uniform media @xcite , the inhomogeneous nature of the ism should be taken into account to investigate gas dynamics in a local scale or on a galactic central region . in the case that we have no observational information about the ism with fine enough spatial resolution ( e.g. parsec scale ) in external galaxies , the simple treatment of the ism is enough to compare the models with observations .",
    "hopefully we will have extremely high quality observations on the ism in the next decade .",
    "high resolution observations with the next generation millimeter / submillimeter interferometer ( e.g. alma ) will reveal the molecular gas structure with a hundred times finer spatial resolution .",
    "therefore more realistic treatment of the ism in simulations on a galactic scale is necessary to understand the ism through comparison with the observations .",
    "recently wada & norman ( 1999 , 2001 ) have investigated dynamics and structure of a self - gravitating gas disk in the central kpc region of a galaxy , taking into account realistic cooling ( 10 k @xmath4k ) and heating . using high accuracy euler mesh code",
    ", they showed that the globally stable , inhomogenoeus interstellar matter is formed as natural consequences of gravitational and thermal instabilities .",
    "the surface density ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 pc@xmath7 , and the dense gas formes clumps or filaments where the temperature is @xmath8 k. in the diffuse gas , on the other hand , the gaseous temperature is @xmath9 k as a result of shock heating or @xmath10 k due to supernova explosions .    in this paper",
    ", we invesigate the gas dynamics in a weak barred potential using the same numerical method presented by @xcite ( hereafter wn01 ) .",
    "energy feedback from stars and supernovae , which are implimented in wn01 , are not considered here for simplicity ( see wada , spaans , & kim 2001 for effects of the energy feedback to the ism ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we give a brief description of our numerical code and models . in ",
    "3.1 numerical results of the global structure of the self - gravitating multi - phase ism in a weak barred potential are discussed .",
    "effects of the advective heating and cooling are analytically studied in  3.2 . in  4 , observational implications derived from the position velocity diagrams and rotation curves are discussed .",
    "finally we summarize the results in  5 .",
    "in order to model the global evolution of the multi - phase ism , a hydrodynamical code must deal with a wide dynamic range ( e.g. , scale : 1 pc @xmath11 a few kpc , density : @xmath12 @xmath13 , and temperature : @xmath14 k ) .",
    "moreover , shocks must be resolved correctly , because typical mach numbers range from 10 to 100 in the ism of galaxies , and also sne and stellar winds cause strong shocks with mach numbers of several hundreds .",
    "we also need high spatial resolution for the hot , diffuse gas as well as for the cold , dense gas . in a rotating non - axisymmetric potential",
    ", the dynamical resonances play an important role for producing spiral shocks , density waves , and ring - like strucutres .",
    "we are interested in how the local inhomogeneous structure of the ism affects formation of these global resonant structures .",
    "we use hydrodynamical simulations for a single fluid taking into account the self - gravity of the gas , radiative cooling , and heating processes .",
    "the multi - phase feature of the gas , that is , the multi - temperature and multi - density structure , should be achieved as a result of the non - linear evolution of a single fluid , if we take into account realistic cooling and heating processes , and the self - gravity of the gas with relevant spatial resolution .",
    "we investigate the effects of the global dynamics of the gas in a bar potential , therefore it requires that the whole rotating disk is simulated . the hydrodynamical part of the simulations is solved by a high - accuracy explicit eulerian code with non - adaptive numerical grids .",
    "the effect of the radiative cooling is implemented using an implicit method with a cooling function .",
    "the numerical code is tested for various standard problems ( see details wn01 ) .",
    "we solve the following equations numerically on a rotating frame of a bar potential in two dimensions .",
    "@xmath15 & = & \\gamma_{\\rm uv}- \\rho \\lambda(t_g ) , \\label{eq3}\\\\ \\nabla^2 \\phi_{\\rm sg } & = & 4 \\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqn : poi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath16 are density , pressure , and velocity of the gas , the specific total energy @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the pattern speed of the bar potential .",
    "the potential of the analytical models is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric potentials , respectively .",
    "we use the ` toomre disk ' potential for the axisymmetric part .",
    "the potential has two parameters @xmath23 ( scale parameter called ` core radius ' ) and @xmath24 ( the maximum rotation speed ) , and expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is given as @xmath27 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric part of the potential is assumed to be in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given as @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 represents the strength of the bar .",
    "this formalism is taken from @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is at full strength from the beginning of simulations .",
    "since our bar models are weak ( @xmath32 0.05 , i.e. @xmath33 ) , initial strong shocks and subsequent accretion of gas to the galactic center do not occur .",
    "the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) are solved by second - order ausm ( advection upstream splitting method ) based on @xcite .",
    "we achieve third - order spatial accuracy with the monotone upstream - centered schemes for conservation laws ( muscl ) approach ( @xcite ) .",
    "time integration is achieved by the second - order leap - frog method .",
    "each time step is determined by the courant condition .",
    "we adopt implicit time integration for the cooling term .",
    "various two - dimensional test problems , such as the double mach reflection of a strong shock , a point explosion in an adiabatic uniform medium , an isothermal gas flow in a weak barred potential , and evolution of spiral gravitational waves in a differentially rotating disk are described in @xcite .",
    "we find that ausm with muscl is as powerful a scheme for astrophysical problems as ppm ( @xcite ) , but the algorithms and coding are much simpler than ppm .",
    "we use @xmath34 cartesian grid points for calculating gas dynamics in a 2 kpc@xmath35 2 kpc region which includes the galactic center .",
    "therefore the spatial resolution is 0.98 pc .",
    "the gravitational potential of the gas is calculated using the convolution method with the fast fourier transform ( @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "@xmath36 grid cells and a periodic green s function are used to calculated the self - gravity of the isolated matter in the @xmath34 grid points .",
    "we also assume a cooling function @xmath37 @xmath38 and the photoelectric heating rate @xmath39 .",
    "we use the cooling curves of spaans & norman ( 1997 ) ( fig.1 in wn01 ) .",
    "the cooling processes taken into account are , ( 1 ) recombination of h , he , c , o , n , si and fe , ( 2 ) collisional excitation of hi , ci - iv and oi - iv , ( 3 ) hydrogen and helium bremsstrahlung , ( 4 ) vibrational and rotational excitation of h@xmath40 and ( 5 ) atomic and molecular cooling due to fine - structure emission of c , c@xmath41 and o , and rotational line emission of co and h@xmath40 .",
    "we assume solar metalicity in this paper .",
    "we assume a uniform uv radiation field and photoelectric heating of grains and pahs .",
    "the heating rate @xmath39 is the same as in @xcite : @xmath42 where the heating efficiency @xmath43 is assumed to be 0.05 and @xmath44 is the incident fuv field normalized to the local interstellar value .",
    "the initial condition is an axisymmetric , uniform and rotationally supported disk , whose radius is 1 kpc , with the total gas mass @xmath45 which is about 2 % of the total mass determined by the background gravitational potential .",
    "the initial rotational velocity is chosen in order to balance the centrifugal force caused by the external potential @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "random density fluctuations are added to the initial disk , with an amplitude less than 1 % of the unperturbed density and temperature .",
    "the initial temperature is set to @xmath3 k over the whole region . in ghost zones at boundaries ,",
    "the physical values remain at their initial values during the calculations . from test runs",
    ", we found that these boundary conditions are much better than so called ` outflow ' boundaries , because the latter cause strong unphysical reflection of waves at the boundaries .",
    "for comparison with the realistic model , we first show the density and temperature distribution of a model without taking into account self - gravity of the gas in fig .",
    "1 , which is a snapshot at @xmath48 myr ( about 2.4 rotational period at @xmath49 kpc ) . the surface density map ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) shows a typical gas response to a weak bar potential with two inner lindblad resonances ( iilr and oilr ) .",
    "the two inner _ leading _ spirals form an oval structure .",
    "the outer two - arm _ trailing _ spiral is a consequence of the oilr @xcite . the temperature map ( fig",
    ". 1 ( b ) ) shows a quadruple distribution .",
    "the gas is heated up to @xmath50 k at upstream sides of the leading and the trailing spirals . at downstream regimes ,",
    "the gas temperature is as low as the lower limit of the temperature ( 10 k ) to the contrary .",
    "this extreme anisotropy is because the advective cooling / heating that dominates the heat balance in the supersonic non - axisymmetric flow .",
    "see details in  3.2 .",
    "if we take into account self - gravity of the gas , however , the density and temperature distributions in a quasi - stable state have very different fine structures from fig .",
    "1 . figure 2 shows density and temperature maps of the self - gravitating model at @xmath51 myr . as seen in the density map ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the clumpy and filamentary dense gases form weak spiral density enhancements , whose location roughly coincides with those in the non - self - gravitating model .",
    "the cold gases form complexes of clouds in the spirals that look similar to the giant molecular clouds in spiral galaxies .",
    "the complicated network of the filaments and clumps on a local scale is the same as that in axisymmetric models in wn01 .",
    "a number of processes are involved in the formation of the filamentary structure : 1 ) tidal and collisional interactions between dense regions formed due to the thermal and gravitational instabilities , 2 ) differential rotation , and 3 ) shear motion due to local turbulent motion ,    the closeup of the central 500 pc region reaveals the fine structure of the gas ( fig .",
    "the dense clumps in the nuclear region are typically 20 - 50 pc across , and their masses @xmath52 .",
    "the filamentary structures , which are nearly parallel to the bar major axis , are prominent .",
    "they are formed due to non - axisymmetric motion and shear in this region .",
    "the density range is greater than four orders of magnitude .",
    "on other hand , the closeup of the arm region ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) shows that its fine structure is very different from that in the nuclear region .",
    "the size of the dense clumps in the arms are smaller than that in the central region , because the velocity dispersion is smaller in the arm regions .",
    "this result suggests that the star formation processes in the arm and in the central regions would be different .    comparing the realistic ism model ( fig .",
    "2 ) with the non - selfgravitating model ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the continuous galactic shocks seen in the non - selfgravitating model , is no longer seen in the realistic model .",
    "spiral structures are actually ensembles of dense clouds and filaments .",
    "the continuous central ring seen in fig .",
    "1 is not also reproduced in the self - gravitating model , where the central density structure is very complicated as seen in fig . 3 ( a ) .",
    "these results suggest that self - gravity of the gas should not be negligible even if the gas mass fraction to the dynamical mass is small ( 2 % in the present case ) , in order to explore the gas dynamics in the central kpc region of galaxies .",
    "the isothermal approximation for the ism , which was often used in past numerical simulations , would be relevant for a galactic scale gas dynamics , but more realistic treatment of the cooling processes should be necessary for the ism on a smaller scale .",
    "we should take into account small scale structure of the ism especially for the cases that star formation and its energy feedback to the ism are important . if one uses the isothermal gas model for the ism with star formation , it is hard to avoid to introduce some phenomenological models for the star formation and energy feedback processes . our numerical approach , which is based on the basic equations that represent the phenomena , is less ambiguous in terms of these points .",
    "we mentioned in the previous section that temperature of the gas in a bar potential changes quadruply on a global scale , i.e. cold ( @xmath53 k ) and hot ( @xmath54 k ) regimes appear alternately around the galactic center ( fig .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) ) .",
    "this is because the advective cooling / heating dominates the heat balance in this system .",
    "this can be explained analytically using the `` damped gas orbit model '' under the epicycle approximation .",
    "@xcite provided an analytical representation which represents the behaviour of a non - self - gravitating gas in a rotating bar - like potential .",
    "its outline is as follows .",
    "the gas dynamics can be understood in terms of closed elliptical orbits which are solutions to the equations of motion of a forced - damping oscillator driven by a periodic external force .",
    "gaseous elliptical orbits always incline to the bar potential in a leading sense inside of the corotation , and in a following sense outside of the corotation .",
    "if there are two ilrs , the gas orbits at the ilrs are oriented by 45@xmath55 with respect to the bar potential .",
    "the damped orbits gradually change their orientation with their radius .",
    "since the direction of the gradual rotation near to the first ilr and that near to the second ilr are in an opposite sense , leading or trailing spiral - like enhancements appear around the first and the second ilr , respectively .",
    "this gradual rotation is explained in terms of the phase - shift of a damping oscillator .",
    "the analytical model well describes the gas behaviour seen in hydrodynamical simulations .    under the epicycle approximation ,",
    "the simplest way to represent the effect of the gaseous nature , such as viscosity , on closed orbits is to introduce a simple damping term , which is proportional to the velocity of the radial oscillation @xmath56 into the equation of motion .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58_{r_0 } \\",
    ", , \\label{e11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 is the damping rate .",
    "this equation describes a radial damped oscillation at around @xmath60 , which is driven by an external periodic force at a frequency of @xmath61 .",
    "the general solution to this equation is @xmath62   \\ , , \\label{e12 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath65 .",
    "the first term of the right - hand side of ( [ e12 ] ) is a general solution of a harmonic oscillator having a natural frequency of @xmath66 with weak friction .",
    "amplitude @xmath67 and the phase - shift , @xmath68 , are @xmath69 and @xmath70 \\ , , \\label{e14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 the phase - shift @xmath72 is always negative if @xmath73 , and @xmath74 when @xmath75 , that is , at the lindblad resonances ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the negative @xmath72 means that the damping oscillation is delayed from the periodic driving force .",
    "since the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ e12 ] ) is a damping term which does not represent a closed orbit , we ignore it . using @xmath77 , we obtain a closed orbit @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80   \\nonumber \\\\ - \\frac{\\phi_b(r)}{2r_0 ^ 2 ( \\omega_0 -\\omega_b)^2 } \\sin(2\\phi_0 ) .",

    "the advective cooling / heating rate is about one order of magnitude larger than the radiative cooling / heating rate in the supersonic gas disk that we are exploring . if the radiative cooling and heating is in an equilibrium ( i.e. , the right - hand side of eq .",

    "@xmath92 is about @xmath93 k myr@xmath94 .",
    "the quadruple anisotropy of the advective cooling and heating in the hydrodynamical simulations ( fig . 1 and 2 ) is well reproduced , and it suggests that the non - axisymmetric velocity field of the gas dominates the global temperature distribution in a weak barred potential .",
    "from the numerical results shown in  3.1 , we can infer how the molecular gas in nearby galaxies is observed with the submillimeter interferometers .",
    "it is crucial to treat realistically the cooling and heating processes of the ism , especially when one tries to compare the numerical result with observations , such as molecular line observations .",
    "as shown in  3.1 , the temperatures of the ism in a bar potential globally anisotropic .",
    "this is essential to interpret the observed molecular line intensity distribution . to make detail comparison between the models and observations",
    ", one needs radiative transfer calculations for molecular lines ( see wada , spaans , & kim 2000 for the large magellanic clouds ) .",
    "alternatively , here we can use the density of the cold gas ( @xmath95 k ) component instead of the line intensity derived from detail line transfer calculations in order to infer the observed molecular gas distribution .",
    "figure 6 ( a ) is the surface density distribution of the cold gas ( @xmath96 k ) with a 100 pc resolution .",
    "one may regard this map as a `` co integrated intensity map '' of a galaxy in the virgo cluster observed with the nobeyama millimeter interferometer , for example .",
    "two clumpy trailing spirals are clearly seen , and one might see a nuclear `` pseudo ring '' .",
    "there are dense regions at the base of the spirals and also at the nuclear region .",
    "figure 6 ( b ) is the same as fig .",
    "6 ( a ) , but with 10 pc resolution .",
    "it is clear that spirals are actually an ensemble of small clumps and filaments ( see also fig .",
    "comparison of the two ` observations ' suggests that spatial resolution of the present - day interferometers are still too coarse to discuss small scale ( e.g. 100 pc ) structure of the cold gas in nearby galaxies . in other words",
    ", one should not be confused by the small scale inhomogeneity , which are comparable to the beam size , seen in observed intensity maps .",
    "the other important implication from our numerical results is that distribution of the cold gas derived from molecular line intensity ( e.g. co ( 1 - 0 ) ) does not necessarily represent true mass distribution of the gas even on a galactic scale . the advective cooling and heating of the gas due to the non - circular velocity field in a bar potential dominate global distribution of the gaseous temperature .",
    "suppose there is a uniform gas ring between the iilr and oilr .",
    "the temperature of the gas ring is roughly divided into two hot ( @xmath97 k ) and two cold ( @xmath95 k ) regions .",
    "therefore we can not observe gases in the hot regions with the co ( 1 - 0 ) lines , for example , and non - axisymmetric distribution of the gas is apparently observed .",
    "a `` hidden '' hot gas component coexists with the nuclear `` pseudo - ring '' seen in fig .",
    "6 ( a ) .    in order to resemble the observed position velocity ( pv ) maps for the molecular gas",
    ", we have convolved the numerical result ( fig .",
    "2 ) with different ` beam sizes ' and velocity resolutions ( fig . 7 and 8) .",
    "the pv maps obtained for three different viewing angles are shown . from comparison between the three figures",
    ", one can find that the pv map strongly depends on the viewing angles ( @xmath98 ) . along the bar major axis ( i.e. @xmath99 ) , about a two times larger line - of - sight velocity than the _ true _ circular rotational velocity ( the dashed curve ) is apparently observed .",
    "if we observe the same model along the minor axis of the bar ( i.e. @xmath100 ) , the pv diagram represents nearly rigid rotation , and the apparent circular velocity is about a half of the real circular velocity at the core radius ( @xmath101 pc ) .",
    "therefore if one observes the ism in a edge - on galaxy that has a weak bar , and evaluate the dynamical mass from the rotation curve , then the mass could be four times larger or smaller than the real mass , depending on the viewing angle .",
    "this viewing angle effect originating in the non - circular gas motion has been also known in previous isothermal simulations @xcite",
    ". more quantitative analysis of the effect of non - circular motion on the rotation curves is discussed in @xcite .",
    "figure 8 is the same as fig . 7 , but with low spatial and velocity resolution ( 100 pc and 5 km s@xmath94 ) which resembles the observations with millimeter interferometers such as nobeyama milliliter array .",
    "although the surface density map does not reveal the fine structure of the cold gas , the low resolution pv map represents basically the same kinematical feature of the system .",
    "the most notable difference between the high and low resolution pv maps is that there are high ` intensity ' , steep velocity components ( @xmath102 km s@xmath94 ) in the high resolution map .",
    "these features are caused by the _ local _ non - circular motion .",
    "most prominent examples are seen in the central region ( @xmath103 pc ) in the pv map ( @xmath99 and @xmath104 ) of fig .",
    "these features are originated from filamentary structures along the bar major axis seen in the density map .",
    "such features can not be resolved as discrete components in the low resolution pv map ( fig . 8) .",
    "therefore , in the low resolution pv maps , one might interpret the rotation curve steeply rises near the galactic center .",
    "one should note that even the bar potential assumed here is very weak ( @xmath105 ) , the non - circular motion of the gas is large enough to cause the viewing angle effect on the pv diagrams as seen in fig .",
    "the parsec - scale structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the central kpc region of a galaxy with a weak bar - like potential is discussed based on our two dimensional , high resolution hydrodynamical simulations , taking into account realistic cooling and self - gravity of the gas .",
    "the results and conclusions are summarized as follows .    * taking into account realistic cooling / heating processes and self - gravity of the gas , the smooth spiral shocks which appear in the non - self - gravitating , isothermal gas model are not formed in the ism . * the resonant structures due to the inner lindblad resonances , such as spirals , have actually parsec - scale fine structures , which are filamentary and clumpy dense gases (  3.1 ; fig .",
    "the fine structures are different between the arms and the nuclear region (  3.1 ; fig .",
    "3 ) * there is large scale anisotropy of the gaseous temperature , which is due to the non - circular velocity field of the gas (  3.1 ; fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the damped orbit model based on the epicycle approximation explains the quadratic distribution of the hot ( @xmath0 k ) and cold ( @xmath1 k ) gases around the galactic center ( fig . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "* because of the temperature anisotropy , cold gases observed by molecular lines do not necessarily represent all gas components even on a global scale (  3.2 ; fig .",
    "* position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams depend strongly on the viewing angles even if the bar component is very weak",
    ". the line - of sight velocity inferred from the pv maps along the major axis of the bar potential is about four times larger than that along the minor axis (  4 ; fig .",
    "* pv diagrams obtained using the same spatial and velocity resolutions in the present millimeter interferometers globally show the same kinematics of the gas with ten times finer resolutions .",
    "however , the low resolution pv maps do not reveal the fine velocity structure , and as a result , steeply rising rotation curves near the galactic center ( @xmath106 pc ) can be apparently observed (  4 ; fig . 7 and 8) . *",
    "the spatial resolution of the present millimeter interferometers for external galaxies are not fine enough to discuss the gas dynamics on a hundred parsec scale , and we should wait for the next generation radio interferometers , e.g. alma ( fig .",
    "most numerical simulations on the gas dynamics in a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential in the last three decades have assumed the simple model of the ism . under such approximation",
    ", the gas dynamics is well understood theoretically .",
    "however , we should investigate again the dynamics and structure of the ism in galaxies using more realistic model based on the relevant basic equations .",

    "<S> the structure of the interstellar medium in the central kpc region of a galaxy with a weak bar - like potential is investigated taking into account realistic cooling and heating processes and the self - gravity of the gas . using high resolution hydrodynamical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , it is revealed that the resonant structures ( e.g. smooth spiral shocks and a nuclear ring ) are very different from those seen in past numerical models where simple models of the ism , i.e. non - self - gravitating , isothermal gas were assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pc - scale filaments and clumps form large scale spirals , which resemble those seen in real galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the fine structures are different between the arms and in the nuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> the next generation millimeter interferometer ( alma ) may reveal the fine structures of the cold gas in nearby galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find a large scale anisotropy in the gas temperature , which is caused due to non - circular velocity field of the gas . the damped orbit model based on the epicyclic approximation explains the distribution of the hot ( @xmath0 k ) and cold ( @xmath1 k ) gases appearing alternately around the galactic center . because of the temperature anisotropy , cold gases observed by molecular lines do not necessarily represent the real gas distribution in galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> position - velocity diagrams depend strongly on the viewing angles . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the rotational velocity inferred from the pv maps could be two times larger or smaller than the true circular velocity . </S>"
