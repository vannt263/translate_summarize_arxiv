    "since the observations of ngc 1068 in polarized light by antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) , showing the presence of broad permitted lines in emission , the idea of the unification scheme of radio  quiet seyfert galaxies and quasars emerged ( for reviews see antonucci 1993 ; robson 1996 ; peterson 1997 ; wills 1999 ; krolik 1999 ) . the simplest version of the scheme assumes the presence of a dusty `` torus '' surrounding the central regions of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) intercepting a fraction of the illuminating accretion disc radiation and re  emitting it in the infrared .",
    "if the absorption is due to dust , there is a natural temperature scale in the system , since dust sublimates for temperatures greater than @xmath1 k , corresponding to a peak in the corresponding black body spectrum at @xmath2 hz ( or @xmath3 m ; the 3.93 factor is appropriate for the peak in the @xmath4 spectrum ) .",
    "the torus origin , stability , structure ( see e.g. krolik & begelman 1988 ) and its very presence in both highly luminous radio  quiet quasars and in low luminosity radio loud sources is under debate .",
    "the amount of reprocessed ir radiation seems to become smaller for larger optical luminosity in radio  quiet objects ( i.e. `` receding torus '' , lawrence 1991 ) , while , for radio sources , the absence of broad emission lines in low power fr i radio  galaxies ( and bl lacs ) could be intrinsic , and not due to an obscuring torus ( chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "along the years , the idea of a simple and uniform `` doughnut '' around the accretion disc has been replaced by a clumped material , possibly outflowing ( or inflowing ) , as envisaged and modeled by many authors ( see e.g. elvis 2000 ; risaliti , elvis & nicastro 2002 ; elitzur & shlosman 2006 ; nenkova 2008 ) .",
    "the existence of the unifying scenario based upon intrinsically equal but observationally different agn is also at the base of synthesis models of the x  ray background ( setti & woltjer 1989 ; madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; comastri et al . 1995 ; gilli , comastri & hasinger 2007 ) , since also the x ",
    "rays are partly absorbed , and partly ( compton ) reflected by the torus ( ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ) : for large viewing angles , the observed x  ray emission becomes very hard , as required to fit the x  ray background .",
    "the covering factor of the absorbing material forming the `` torus '' is not well known .",
    "estimates come from direct observations of optical and ir agn , as well from statistical considerations concerning the number of type 1 and type 2 agn . in the first case ,",
    "the studies were hampered up to now by the relatively small samples of objects ( especially in the ir ) suitable for a combined study ( see e.g. landt et al .",
    "2011 for a sample of 23 objects observed spectroscopically in the optical and in the ir , down to @xmath5 m ) .    in order to study the accretion disc  torus connection in agn , we need to collect the largest group of radio  quiet agn with reliable detections of the ir luminosity and an optical spectrum to characterize the accretion disc features .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and the wide  field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) are the catalogs with the widest number of objects in these two bands , hence they are the most appropriate for our study .",
    "wise provided photometric observations in 4 ir bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath6 m ) for half a billion sources ( all sky ) with fluxes larger than 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6 mjy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in the four bands .",
    "the sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we consider the fifth edition of the sdss quasar catalog ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 ) , containing 105,783 quasars with magnitude smaller than @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11@xmath12 ) , at least an emission line with fwhm@xmath13 and a reliable spectroscopical redshift .",
    "continuum and line luminosities ( as well as many other spectral properties ) in sdss spectra have been measured by shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ; hereafter s11 ) .",
    "we will use these data to estimate optical bolometric luminosity of the sources , following two independent methods .",
    "the first one relies on the 3000  continuum luminosity : @xmath14 ) ( e.g. elvis et al . 1994 ; richards et al .",
    "2006 ) . the second one will be used for a consistency check of our results , and relies on h@xmath15 and mgii line luminosities (  [ sec - lines ] ) . in the following",
    "we will assume that the bolometric luminosity equals the accretion disc luminosity .",
    "the superscript `` iso '' reminds that they are derived under the assumption of isotropic emission .    the requirement that all sources are observed in the rest frame 25005500   range ( to comprise both the h@xmath15 and mgii lines and the continuum at 3000  ) sets our first selection criterion .",
    "given the wavelength coverage of the sdss , we require a corresponding redshift range : @xmath16 . the s11 catalog has also been cross  correlated with the faint images of the radio sky at twenty  centimeter survey ( first ; becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and hence s11 include in their sample the radio fluxes .",
    "the flux limit of the first sample is @xmath01 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "therefore , we can select the radio  quiet quasars as those objects observed by the first without a detectable radio flux . the radio  quiet requirement ensures the absence of a contamination from the jet in the wavelength intervals of interest . after the radio  quietness and the redshift selections ,",
    "we are left with 5122 sources .",
    "we have cross  correlated this sample with the wise all  sky source catalog requiring that the optical and ir positions are closer than 2 arcsec ( 5082 sources ) , and selecting only those objects with detections in all the four wise ir  bands , to have the most complete ir luminosity information .",
    "this last selection leaves us with a sample of 3965 wise  detected , radio  quiet type 1 agn in a redshift range @xmath17=0.560.73 .",
    "for all the 3965 sources in our sample we computed the ir flux in the four wise bands by first transforming the observed ( vega ) magnitudes in the ab systems setting @xmath18 , with @xmath19 given in tab .",

    "consider the simplest case of a doughnut  shaped torus with opening angle @xmath35 , as measured from the symmetry axis .",
    "the covering factor @xmath36 is defined as : @xmath37 we must relate @xmath36 to the observed ratio @xmath33 , accounting for the anisotropy of disc and torus emission . since the emission of geometrically thin discs follows a @xmath38 pattern , for a given viewing angle @xmath39 ( calculated from the disc axis ) the ratio between the real disc luminosity @xmath23 and the isotropic estimate @xmath40 is : @xmath41 the ratio is smaller than unity for @xmath42 , thus for type 1 agn we likely have @xmath43 .",

    "[ eq - anisotropy - disc ] for the torus luminosity ( @xmath47 ) is currently unknown .",
    "however , we can reasonably state that @xmath48 the lower limit corresponds to a thin disc  shaped emitting torus , the upper limit to an isotropic emitting torus .",
    "both limits are rather unrealistic : the torus is expected to show a lower degree of anisotropy than the disc since we are able to detect radiation emitted from the side ( i.e. type 2 agn ) ; also , the torus is hardly an isotropic emitter since ir signatures are different in type 1 and 2 agn ( calderone et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the above limits should then bracket the real case .",
    "the amount of disc radiation intercepted ( and re  processed ) by the torus is : @xmath49 rearranging the previous equations , we find a relation between the observable parameter @xmath50 and the covering factor @xmath36 : @xmath51 this relation can be inverted to find the allowed range of @xmath36 and @xmath35 , given a value of the observable parameter @xmath33 .",

    "the main result of our work is the determination of the average covering factor of the torus using a very large data set .",
    "the _ observed _ fraction of ir to bolometric , isotropically equivalent optical luminosity is about 30% .",
    "this implies that the obscuring torus covering factor is in the range 0.50.7 and that the opening angle @xmath35 is 40@xmath53 60@xmath53 . on average ,",
    "our sources emit in the ir a similar fraction of their bolometric luminosities ( @xmath54 ) . for each type",
    "1 agn , there should be between 1 and 3 type 2 sources .",
    "if there is a broad distribution of covering factors ( as suggested by elitzur , 2012 ) our type 1 sample may be drawn preferentially from the lower end of the distribution . in this case our estimate of # 2/#1 ratio is a lower limit .",
    "the very basic prediction of the unified model that the torus re  processes a given amount of disc luminosity is verified ( fig .",
    "[ fig - whole ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - histo - covering ] ) .",
    "the dispersion of this fraction is remarkably small , being at most a factor of 2 .",
    "the broad  band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from ir to near  uv are expected to be quite similar among type 1 agn .",
    "a hint of the `` receding torus '' hypothesis is found in fig .",

    "spectral indices between the four wise bands are very similar for different overall luminosities ( tab .",
    "[ tab - reswise ] ) . despite the rather poor coverage",

    "such features are easily modeled by the superposition of two black bodies with temperatures of @xmath0300 k and @xmath01500 k respectively .",
    "a nave interpretation is to consider the hotter one as emitted from the hot part of the torus facing the disc , at the dust sublimation temperature .",
    "the colder one would come from the cooler outer side of the torus .",
    "this should be the region visible also in type 2 agn .",
    "the underlying optical continua are well described by a standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) accretion disc spectrum .",

[ fig - wise - sdss ] are the models of three accretion discs having the same bolometric luminosity as the spectra in the subsample , and masses @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 m@xmath59 respectively , grossly in agreement with the ( virial ) masses calculated in s11 .",
