    "the study of the structure - function relationship of biomolecular systems often requires to follow their dynamics with almost atomic spatial resolution on a macroscopic time scale , which is beyond the reach of current all atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "a typical example is molecular and ion transport through channel proteins @xcite . indeed , in order to determine the forces that guide the diffusion of molecules across the channel one needs to know with atomic precision the structure of the channel protein - lipid - solvent environment .",
    "however , the duration of the permeation process across the channel occurs on a time scale ( e.g. , @xmath0s to ms ) that may exceed by several orders of magnitude the time scale of several tens of nanoseconds currently attainable by all atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations@xcite .",
    "whenever the dynamic properties of interest of such a system can be described in terms of a small number of reaction coordinates ( rcs ) then a practical approach to this inherently multiscale problem is to model the system as fictitious overdamped brownian particles that diffuse along the rcs in the presence of an effective potential of mean force ( pmf ) that describes their interaction with the rest of the system .",
    "recently we have proposed an efficient method for calculating simultaneously both the pmf , @xmath1 , and the corresponding diffusion coefficient , @xmath2 , along a rc , @xmath3 , by employing a small number of fast nonequilibrium md simulations in both forward ( f ) and time reversed ( r ) directions @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this method , referred to as the _ fr method _",
    ", was demonstrated by calculating the pmf and the diffusion coefficient of single - file water molecules in single - walled carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the obtained results were found to be in very good agreement with the results from other pmf calculation methods , e.g. , umbrella sampling @xcite .    to further test its viability , in this paper we apply the fr method to investigate the energetics of two well - studied exemplary systems , i.e. , ( i ) the helix - to - coil transition of deca - alanine in vacuum , and ( ii ) the transport of @xmath4 ions in the gramicidin a ( ga ) channel protein , inserted in a fully solvated pope lipid bilayer . in each case",
    "we seek to calculate the pmf as a function of a proper rc , i.e. , the end - to - end distance ( @xmath3 ) of deca - alanine and the position ( @xmath5-coordinate ) of the potassium ion along the axis of the ga channel . the computed pmfs",
    "are found to be in good agreement with previous results obtained by using either the jarzynski equality @xcite or the umbrella sampling method @xcite .",
    "however , compared to these pmf calculation methods our approach is about one order of magnitude faster and , in addition , also provides the position dependent diffusion coefficient along the rc .",
    "thus , by employing the computed pmf and diffusion coefficient in a suitable stochastic model we could estimate important characteristics of the studied systems , e.g. , the mean folding time of the stretched deca - alanine and the mean first passage time of @xmath4 through the ga channel .    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . to make the presentation self - contained , in sec .",

    "however , in practice eq .   is valid only close to equilibrium because smd pulling paths can sample only a narrow region about the peak of the gaussian @xmath36 , while the validity of je is crucially dependent on very rare trajectories with negative dissipative work ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus , in general , having only a few smd trajectories one can determine fairly accurately the mean work @xmath38 but not the variance @xmath39 , which in most cases is seriously underestimated .    in the fr method",
    "this shortcoming is eliminated by combining both f and r pulling trajectories and employing eq .  , which is more general than the je . within the stiff - spring approximation , eq .",
    "implies that the f and r work distribution functions are identical but displaced gaussians , and the pmf and the mean dissipative work @xmath40 can be determined from the following simple equations @xcite    @xmath41    @xmath42    and [ eq : fr-2 ] @xmath43    equations are the key formulas of our fr method for calculating pmfs from fast f and r smd pullings . clearly , the superiority of the fr method , for calculating the pmf ( and the mean dissipative work ) , compared to the one based on the je equation is due to the fact that eqs .",
    "contain only the mean f and r work ( whose values can be estimated rather accurately even from a few smd trajectories ) and not the corresponding variance . in fact the latter ( see eq .  )",
    "is also determined by the mean f and r work .",
    "although , strictly speaking , the fr method can only determine the pmf difference between initially equilibrated states connected by f and r smd trajectories , in practice we find that in many cases eqs  - give good results even between the division points @xmath44 , @xmath45 , of the interested interval [ @xmath46,@xmath47 .",
    "the reason for this is that for a stiff harmonic guiding potential the equilibrium distribution of the rc is a narrow gaussian that can be sampled through very short md simulations .",
    "thus , even if the system is far from equilibrium due to fast pulling by a sufficiently stiff spring , the instantaneous value of the rc will always be sufficiently close to its equilibrium value .",
    "however , even in such cases the pulling speed should not exceed values that would cause excessive perturbation to the rest of the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "thus , the number of division points , @xmath48 , does not need to be large , implying a fairly small computational overhead for the equilibration of the system at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "an alternative approach for calculating the pmf difference between two equilibrium states connected by @xmath49 forward and @xmath50 reverse smd paths is based on the _ maximum likelihood estimator _ ( mle )",
    "method applied to crooks fluctuation theorem @xcite , i.e. , @xmath51 we use eq .   to test the accuracy of the pmf results obtained with our fr method .",
    "finally , since it is reasonable to assume that @xmath52 is proportional to the pulling speed @xmath26 , one can readily determine the position dependent friction coefficient @xmath53 from the slope of the mean dissipative work @xmath54 .",
    "then , the corresponding diffusion coefficient is given by the einstein relation ( in @xmath15 energy units ) @xcite @xmath55 once both @xmath1 and @xmath56 are determined , the dynamics of the reaction coordinate on a macroscopic time scale can be described by the langevin equation corresponding to an overdamped brownian particle@xcite    [ eq : fr - l - fp ] @xmath57 or equivalently , by the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution function @xmath58 of the reaction coordinate @xmath59+\\partial_r[u'(r ) p(r , t)]\\ ; ,      \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the langevin force ( modeled as a gaussian white noise ) and @xmath61 is the probability current density .",
    "for example ,",
    "eq .   can be used to calculate the mean folding time of deca - alanine ( see sec .  [ sec:10ala - results ] ) from the completely stretched ( coil ) conformation @xmath62 to the folded ( helical ) conformation @xmath63 as the corresponding _ mean first passage time _",

    "[ fig : pmf - protocol - comp ] ( thick solid line ) . the transverse flexibility of the channel leads to fluctuations in its radius that facilitate the diffusion of @xmath4 along the pore .",
    "this is in total agreement with previously published results , which emphasize the crucial role played by the flexibility of the ga channel in its cation transport properties @xcite .",
    "the pmf for system s3 was determined with the fr method by employing two different pulling protocols .",
    "first , the pulling force on @xmath4 was applied along the @xmath5-axis ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmf - protocol - comp ] ) but there was no restrain on the cation s motion in the cross section of the pore ( i.e. , in the @xmath142-plane ) .",
    "in the second set of pullings , beside the elastic pulling force oriented along the @xmath5-axis , the potassium ion was constrained to move along the axis of the channel ( thick solid line in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmf - protocol - comp ] ) .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmf - protocol - comp ] , both pulling protocols yielded essentially the same pmf .",
    "thus , we preferred using routinely the second pulling method especially because during the first one the potassium ion occasionally escaped between the two helices into the lipid bilayer .",

    "r mean dissipative works , @xmath148 , ( averaged over the two segments ) are also shown in fig .",

    "while the former ( ca@xmath152 ) systematically underestimates the peaks in the pmf and the corresponding mean dissipative work , the latter ( ca@xmath153 ) systematically overestimates the same quantities .",
    "the difference between the central barrier height of the ca@xmath152 and ca@xmath153 pmfs is @xmath154  k@xmath120 t , while at the channel entrance the difference is almost twice as big ( @xmath155  k@xmath120 t ) .",
    "the negative ( positive ) bias in ca@xmath152 ( ca@xmath153 ) is due to the fact that the je approach uses explicitly the variance ( i.e. , the 2nd cumulant ) of the corresponding non - equilibrium work distributions , which ( unlike the mean work ) can not be accurately estimated from a few smd pullings ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "however , by averaging ca@xmath152 and ca@xmath153 the opposite biases more or less cancel out and the resulting mean pmf ( thick dashed line in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : pmf - wd_fr - vs - je]b , the same conclusion can be drawn for the mean dissipative work as well .",
    "our @xmath122 , calculated using the fr method , ( thick solid line in fig .",

    "another small barrier ( @xmath159  @xmath15 ) appears to be located between the two high barriers , right at the geometrical center of ga .",
    "this small center barrier is well separated by the two main ones by a potential well of @xmath160  k@xmath120 t . according to fig .",

    "these authors used the standard umbrella sampling ( us ) method @xcite to calculate their pmfs .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : frvsus ] , besides the small difference in the positions of the wells at the ends of the ga channel , there are two notable differences between the pmfs obtained by the fr and us methods .",
    "first , the barrier height of the pmf computed with the fr method is only @xmath141  k@xmath120 t as compared to @xmath161  k@xmath120 t obtained from us .",
    "second , the central peak in @xmath122 obtained from the fr ( us ) method is @xmath162  k@xmath120 t below ( above ) the two main peaks .     in the ga channel determined from the fr method ( by employing different smd pulling protocols as described in the text ) , and the umbrella sampling method @xcite.,width=326 ]    to test the reliability of the fr method for determining @xmath122 , besides the standard pulling protocol ( involving @xmath86 smd pulls in both f and r directions with a pulling speed @xmath163   / ns ) , we have used two additional ones , involving only @xmath93 smd pulls in both f and r directions .",
    "the two pulling protocols differed only in their pulling speeds , namely @xmath163   / ns in the first ( thin - solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : frvsus ] ) and @xmath164   / ns ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : frvsus ] ) in the second . as",
    "seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : frvsus ] , all three fr method calculations yielded a consistent pmf , with noticeable differences only around the ends of the ga channel .",
    "although the fr method leads to @xmath122 similar to the us result ( albeit with a smaller main barrier height ) none of these pmfs is suitable for reproducing the experimentally measured @xmath4 conductivity of the ga channel .",
    "this would require a channel entrance well depth of @xmath119  k@xmath120 t and a main barrier height of @xmath121  k@xmath120 t @xcite .",
    "the main problems in getting these values are due to the limitations of the currently used md methods that use empirical non - polarizable forcefields and , therefore , can not account for the induced polarization in the lipid hydrocarbons and , most importantly , for the polarization of water in the course of the md simulations @xcite .    in order to mimic polarization effects caused by the passage of @xmath117 through the channel",
    ", we reduced the partial charge of the ion from @xmath165 to @xmath166 in system s3 ( see sec .",
    "[ ga - modeling ] ) , and carried out new smd f and r pullings for recalculating the pmf through the fr method .",
    "the resulting @xmath122 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frvsus ] ( dashed line ) . as one can see , in the new pmf the potential wells at the entrance of the channel moved by @xmath167    towards the center and their depth increased to @xmath168  @xmath15 . furthermore , in a more dramatic change , the height of the barrier decreased from @xmath141  k@xmath120 t to @xmath169  k@xmath120 t .",
    "although the above approach to account for polarization effects is rather simplistic , the obtained pmf ( apart from the new positions of the potential wells ) has the previously estimated form @xcite that is capable for describing quantitatively the transport of @xmath4 in ga .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the _ fr method _ @xcite provides an effective approach for calculating both the pmf , @xmath1 , and the diffusion coefficient , @xmath56 , along a properly chosen reaction coordinate @xmath3 , in biomolecular systems by using only a small number of fast forward and time reversed constant velocity smd simulations .",
    "the obtained pmfs for deca - alanine are in good agreement with the ones reported in recent studies @xcite .",
    "we have found that computationally the fr method is more efficient and accurate than similar pmf calculation methods , e.g. , the one based on the jarzynski equality . by employing the computed pmf and diffusion coefficient in a suitable stochastic model we could estimate important characteristics of the studied systems , e.g. , the mean folding time of the stretched deca - alanine .",
    "we also applied the fr method to calculate the pmf of a potassium ion through the gramicidin a channel . as expected from previous _ umbrella sampling _ calculations , the obtained pmf featured a main central barrier of height @xmath157  k@xmath120 t and two wells at the entrance in the channel with depth @xmath170  @xmath15 .",
    "the pmf was reproduced rather well when using a smaller number of smd pulling trajectories and/or higher smd pulling speeds , confirming the reliability of the fr method .",
    "the channel protein flexibility , maintained in the smd simulations by restraining the corresponding backbone atoms only along the axis of the channel , has been shown to play a major role in the transport of @xmath117 in gramicidin a. indeed , the height of the main potential barrier in a rigid channel is almost three times higher than in the flexible one .",
    "the dissipative work inside the channel was found to be linear in @xmath5 , yielding a constant diffusion coefficient @xmath171  @xmath78/ns .",
    "the pmf calculated from the same smd pulls using jarzynski s equality with the cumulant approximation yielded inconsistent results for both forward and reverse directions .",
    "however , the biases in these to directions almost cancel out when averaging the forward and reverse pmfs , leading to almost the same result as the fr method .",
    "furthermore , the fr method yielded consistently pmfs similar to the ones using the traditional umbrella sampling method but in considerably less time ( i.e. , @xmath172 days per pmf on a 64  cpu , 2.8ghz intel xeon em64 t , cluster )",
    ". however , the conduction of the channel can not be reproduced with any of the computed pmf profiles , mainly because of the very large central barrier .",
    "the main problem in determining pmfs in ion channels through md simulations is the poor treatment of polarization effects by the current non - polarizable forcefields . to account for the polarization of k@xmath173 inside the channel ,",
    "its effective point charge was reduced to @xmath166 .",
    "the recalculated pmf exhibited barrier and well sizes very close to the values needed to reproduce the experimental data .",
