    "sensitive detection of a single nanoparticle / molecule is essential for many applications ranging from medical diagnostics , drug discovery , security screening , to environmental science . in the past decades",
    ", a variety of approaches have been developed , among which optical detection based on high - q microcavities has shown significant advantages for its high sensitivity and label - free operation  @xcite . here , by taking advantage of the intriguing optically induced spring in a silica microsphere , we demonstrate that a quivering cavity can enhance the sensing resolution by orders of magnitude compared with conventional approaches , which allows us to detect single bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) proteins with a molecular weight of @xmath0  kdalton at a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath2 .",
    "this unique approach opens up a distinctive avenue that not only enables biomolecule sensing and recognition at individual level , but also exhibits great potential for studying / manipulating mechanical properties of individual biomolecules and their interactions .    , which is transduced to a mechanical frequency shift @xmath3 .",

    "this mechanism underlies the majority of current microcavity sensors , with a sensing resolution dependent critically on the optical quality factor ( q )  @xcite . to date , the highest resolution reported is a resonance shift of @xmath9 achieved with an optical q of one hundred million at a visible wavelength in an aqueous environment  @xcite , which , however , is still larger than that induced by a single protein binding event  @xcite",
    ". consequently , detection of single protein molecule requires incorporating a plasmonic nanoantenna on the microcavity to enhance the resonance wavelength shift  @xcite , at a price of significant reduction of effective detection area .    on the other hand ,",
    "the optical wave cycling inside the microcavity is able to produce a radiation pressure that interacts with the mechanical motion of the device ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]a ) .",
    "such optomechanical coupling flourishes in profound physics that has been intensively explored in recent years , particularly in the context of quantum control of mesoscopic mechanical motion  @xcite .",
    "when the laser wavelength is blue detuned to the cavity resonance , the optical wave can efficiently boost the mechanical motion above the threshold of regenerative oscillation  @xcite , resulting in highly coherent optomechanical oscillation ( omo ) with a narrow mechanical linewidth . of particular interest",
    "is that the optical wave is able to produce an effective mechanical rigidity whose magnitude depends sensitively on the laser - cavity detuning  @xcite .",
    "consequently , any tiny perturbation to the cavity resonance wavelength induced by particle / molecule binding would be readily transferred to the frequency shift of the mechanical motion , enabling an efficient transduction mechanism to amplify the resonance wavelength sensing . with the narrow linewidth of coherent omo ,",
    "the intriguing optical spring effect would thus offer an elegant approach for sensitive probing of cavity resonance variation , with a sensing resolution given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective mechanical q factor of omo , @xmath12 is the loaded optical q , and @xmath13 represents the optomechanical transduction factor for sensing whose magnitude depends on laser - cavity detuning , with a value in the order of @xmath14 .",
    "equation  ( [ deltalambda_res ] ) shows clearly that the sensing resolution scales not only with the optical q of the cavity as what does in conventional microcavity sensors , but also with the effective mechanical q of omo .",
    "consequently , in principle , the proposed cavity optomechanical transduction sensing is able to enhance the sensing resolution by about a factor of @xmath11 compared with conventional approaches . as we will show below",
    ", the mechanical q of coherent omo in our device can reach a value above @xmath15 , resulting in a sensing resolution enhanced by orders of magnitude that is well sufficient for single molecule detection .",
    "as the optomechanical effect is intrinsic to a high - q microcavity , the proposed approach does not rely on any specific external sensing element attached to the device ( @xmath16 , a plasmonic nanoantenna  @xcite ) , thus capable of fully utilizing the entire effective sensing area offered by a whispering - gallery microcavity which is more than five orders of magnitude larger than that of plasmonic devices .",
    "for the same reason , it does not rely on any gain medium , thus universal to different material platforms as long as the device has reasonably high optical q. on the other hand , this approach is distinctive from the conventional micro-/nano - mechanical sensing  @xcite where the particle detection is realized by monitoring the mechanical frequency shift directly induced by the mass change from particle attaching , which , however , exhibits a minimal detectable mass of @xmath17 that relies critically on the motional mass @xmath18 and the mechanical q of the sensor .",
    "although this mechanism was recently applied in combination with optical actuation and readout , it can only detect @xmath19-@xmath20-diameter silica beads with a picogram resolution  @xcite .",

    "to verify the above sensing principle , we carried out experiments in a silica microsphere with a diameter of about 100  @xmath28 . the device exhibits an intrinsic optical q as high as @xmath4 at a wavelength around @xmath29  nm in the aqueous environment ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]c ) , which is close to the theoretical limit .",
    "with such a high optical q , the optical wave inside the microsphere produces a strong radiation pressure that efficiently actuates the radial breathing mechanical motion of the microsphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]a ) .",
    "consequently , by dropping an optical power of @xmath30  mw into the cavity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]d ) , we are able to boost the mechanical mode above the threshold even in the aqueous environment , resulting in coherent omo at a frequency of @xmath31  khz with a mechanical linewidth as narrow as @xmath32  hz ( fig .  [ fig_simulation]f ) , corresponding to an effective mechanical q of @xmath6 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]e , the significant optomechanical oscillation leads to a harmonic comb on the power spectrum of the cavity transmission , a feature of coherent omo resulting from the nonlinear transduction of the optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the strong optical spring effect from the optomechanical coupling results in an omo frequency sensitively dependent on the laser - cavity detuning ( fig .",
    "[ fig_detune]a ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_detune]c , when the laser - cavity wavelength detuning decreases from @xmath33  fm , the omo frequency increases from @xmath34  khz to a peak value of @xmath35  khz , and then decreases quickly to about @xmath36  khz when the laser wavelength is tuned close to the center of cavity resonance , with a tuning slope of @xmath37  khz / fm at a laser - cavity detuning of @xmath38 .",
    "the observed optical spring follows closely the theoretical expectation ( grey curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_detune]c ) .",
    "such an optical spring corresponds to a sensitive _ optical - to - mechanical frequency transduction _ , inferring that every @xmath39-fm cavity resonance wavelength shift induced by a particle binding event can be transduced to an omo frequency change of about @xmath40  khz that is about four orders of magnitude larger than the linewidth of optomechanical oscillation ( fig .",
    "[ fig_simulation]f ) .",
    "a detailed characterization of the allan deviation of the omo frequency ( fig .  [ fig_detune]b ) shows a minimum two sample deviation of @xmath23  hz at the fundamental omo frequency , implying a detection resolution of @xmath41 in the device .",
    "this record resolution clearly shows the powerfulness of the demonstrated approach , which is more than @xmath42 times higher than a conventional microcavity sensor with the same optical q  @xcite .",
    "it is even about @xmath43 times higher than that achieved with an optical q of @xmath44 at a visible wavelength  @xcite .",
    "note that the harmonics of the optomechanical oscillation vary proportionally with the omo fundamental frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig_detune]a ) and thus can also be applied for particle sensing .",
    "although this does not improve the sensing resolution due to the same snr of detection , in practice , the larger frequency shifts on the higher - order harmonics significantly facilitate the mechanical spectrum analysis ( by allowing to use a coarser resolution bandwidth ) , which reduces considerably the excessive detection noises from consecutive multiple particles skimming by the cavity surface .    , @xmath45 , @xmath43 , and @xmath46  nm , where ( a ) shows that of third harmonic and ( b)-(d ) show those of the fundamental oscillation frequency . the insets show the detailed frequency steps .",

    "as the optical spring depends on both the laser - cavity detuning and the optical q , the impact from cavity q change counteracts that from the cavity resonance wavelength shift , leading to a smaller shift of omo frequency     second , with a clear frequency step ( inset ) of @xmath70  khz .",

    "can be further improved significantly in the future .",
    "for example , the minimal detectable omo frequency shift in current devices is primarily limited by the laser frequency jitter in our experiment . with an omo linewidth of only @xmath76",
