    "as well known , the formal definition of the zeta function is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( natural integer ) .",
    "@xcite is a good source .    the problem of the existence and location of the zeroes of the zeta function is known to have important implications in number theory .",
    "these zeroes fall into one or the other of two main categories : `` trivial '' and `` non - trivial '' zeroes .",
    "trivial zeroes , infinite in number , are located on the real axis at @xmath6 and do not concern the object of the present essay .",
    "non - trivial known zeroes are also infinitely many and are located on the ` critical line ' ( c.l . )",
    "these will be termed in the following `` canonical zeroes '' .",
    "they occur in complex conjugated ( c.c . )",
    "pairs @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "it is not yet known whether there are non - trivial zeroes outside the c.l . , but it is known , see ref.@xcite , that all non - trivial zeroes are constrained to lie inside to the `` critical strip '' @xmath10 .",
    "the celebrated riemann hypothesis , formulated in 1859 , see refs.@xcite,@xcite , states that those on the c.l .",
    "are the only non - trivial zeroes of the zeta function . in other words , no pair of c.c .",
    "zeroes can be found outside of the c.l .",
    "the proof of the possibility , or the impossibility , of existence of these `` outlying '' pairs has not been reached up to now , although the known zeroes along the c.l . have been determined ( and the search for outlying zeroes has been pursued ) , by numerical computing , up to extremely large values of y , so that it is ascertained that the outlying zeroes , if they exist , are to be found for exceedingly high values of y , see refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a proof ( or the disproving ) of the hypothesis would have important implications not only in number theory , but also in practical applications of the properties of primes , such as cryptography , see ref .",
    "the aim of the present essay is to propose a synthetic , algebraic approach to the discussion of riemann s hypothesis , using only the tools of ordinary complex algebra and calculus .",
    "the zeta function is defined by eq . only over the half - plane @xmath11 . in order to investigate the riemann hypothesis ,",
    "it is necessary to extend the formula by analytic continuation .",
    "one such extension is the gram - backlund extension , see refs . @xcite and @xcite , which can be written as :    @xmath12    where the symbols @xmath13 stand for the bernoulli numbers of even index .",
    "the zeta function , and its gram - backlund extension , are analytic functions of @xmath14 . as such , they enjoy the properties of analytic functions , to wit : @xmath15 , possibility to develop @xmath16 as a power - series of @xmath14 , etc .    functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath19 ( see further on ) are also analytical functions of @xmath14 .",
    "the basis of the following argument will be the gram - backlund extension of the zeta function .",
    "it will be important to observe that the zeroes of the zeta function are determined by the equation : @xmath20    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined as : @xmath21    it can be easily verified that with definitions are equivalent to @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",

    "it is apparent , in this connection , that @xmath18 is highly symmetrical , see figures  [ fig:1 ] ,  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] : @xmath24    while @xmath17 is the sum of several terms with widely different symmetries and anti - symmetries ; therefore :    @xmath25    where symmetry and anti - symmetry with respect to the c.l .",

    "this dependence of @xmath110 from the parity of exponent @xmath61 is an inconsistency ; besides , @xmath107 would be inconsistent also with condition a. thus a second outlying zero can not exist unless @xmath111 , from which @xmath112 , @xmath113 , which means that the assumed second `` outlying zero '' can not be distinct from the first one .",

    "the necessary conditions a and b are therefore satisfied by @xmath114 , but not by distinct real - valued solutions for @xmath115 and @xmath110 respecting the other constraints of eq . on @xmath89 .    the necessary conclusion of this analysis seems to be that outlying zeroes can not exist .    of course , to actually determine the value of @xmath116 at the canonical zero one would have to take into account also the two remaining equations pertaining to the real and the imaginary components of @xmath117 and of @xmath118 , see section [ sec:7 ] .",
    "it can be shown that making @xmath119 with @xmath120 real and developing formally the above results one would get an internally consistent canonical solution of @xmath121 .",
    "it is interesting per se to observe that the equation @xmath122 means that the assumed zero - point must lie on one of the two `` isotropic lines '' issuing from @xmath34 ; besides , this circumstance is also susceptible of an interesting interpretation .",
    "let us operate a change of cartesian reference axes with origin at @xmath34 .",
    "this change will consist in a counterclockwise rotation of the reference axes through an angle @xmath123 .",

    "mean that it lies on one of the two isotropic lines issuing from the origin of the old system of reference .",
    "thus it enjoys the characteristic property of the isotropic lines , which are the fixed lines of the rotation group .",
    "apparently one would get also @xmath143 , which is another peculiar feature of the isotropic lines ( property of null length ) .",
    "all of the foregoing considerations seem to be consistent indications that the only c.c .",
    "pairs of zero - points of @xmath71 are on the c.l .",
    "( canonical zeroes ) . outlying zero - points such as those foreseen by h / dlvp",
    "are , apparently , not allowed as a consequence of the symmetry properties of the term @xmath56 in the r. h. s. of the second of eq . .",
    "the necessary conditions applied so far in order to obtain a non - trivial outlying zero are the following ones : -in the real domain : @xmath144 -upon observing that these conditions may lead to inconsistencies in the real domain , it was attempted to allow @xmath72 to be a complex quantity : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is real .",
    "more in general , it would be possible to assume that @xmath91 and/or @xmath147 be allowed to take on complex values , but this would lead to the same end results at the price of more involved elaborations . on the other hand , it is convenient to assume that @xmath147 is real and positive , since the hypothetical h / dlvp zero - point should be above the @xmath148 axis . therefore the choice was made to assume @xmath149 , which does not introduce any new constraints , and let @xmath150 be determined by the condition that the system of two equations be not constrained to have null solutions .",
    "@xmath150 was allowed to be a complex quantity so that the system might have a supplementary degree of freedom . in this way it was found that it must be : @xmath151",
    "i.e. the hypothetical h / dlvp zero - point must coincide with a canonical zero .",
    "the move to the complex domain for @xmath91 , thus , appears as a temporary short - cut because in the end , reverting to the real domain , the solution found is equivalent to : @xmath152 the authors were intrigued to observe that this solution implies that @xmath153 belongs to one of the two isotropic lines issuing from @xmath34 .",
    "this fact , indeed , was found to be consistent with a rotation of the coordinate system around the point @xmath34 , which leaves the new complex quantity @xmath154 unchanged with respect with the old value @xmath153 ; therefore the value of @xmath155 remains the same as @xmath156 and likewise the value of @xmath157 remains the same as @xmath158 .",
    "this unexpected relevance of a concept of projective geometry -the isotropic lines- to the analysis of the riemann hypothesis is deemed by the authors to be worthy of note and possibly deserving further investigations .",
    "the tentative result that all the non - trivial zeroes of @xmath71 lie along the c.l . was reached in the preceding sections by considering the conditions to be fulfilled by the anti - symmetric components of @xmath71 . to complete the treatment",

    "the points of the c.l . in which both eqs . and",
    "are fulfilled will be the canonical zeroes of @xmath71 .",
    "the analysis carried out of the algebraic structure of @xmath71 , of the necessary conditions implied by @xmath19 and of the symmetry properties possessed by @xmath17 and @xmath18 seem to point out that the application of such necessary conditions to functions endowed with those symmetry properties is incompatible with the existence of outlying zeroes .",
    "if this conclusion were confirmed , it would provide , in the authors opinion , an interesting line of approach to a full , rigorous discussion of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "in the course of the analysis , it became apparent that the incompatibilities between the null - conditions for @xmath165 and its symmetry features could be formally overcome moving the domain of definition of the variables involved to a wider domain .",
    "however , by translating the result thus obtained into the conditions required by the real and imaginary components of the actual variables involved , the same limitation ( i. e that the allowed non - trivial zeroes must lie on the c.l . ) was confirmed .",
    "the enlargement of the variable domain thus formally introduced was not , however , a useless detour , insofar as it allowed to highlight an unexpected connection between the properties of the zeta function and the properties of the isotropic lines , i.e. with entities and concepts proper to projective geometry .",
    "it is deemed by the authors of the present essay that this connection , only very sketchily outlined in their analysis , is worthy of deeper investigation .",
    "it is also remarkable that symmetry considerations were sufficient to reveal important aspects relevant to the discussion of the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the power of the concepts inherent to the theory of the symmetry groups was thus once more underscored .",
