    "in one of the three seminal papers given by  @xcite at the famous vatican conference held in rome in 1957 , he discussed the stellar populations in the galactic bulge .",
    "it is interesting to note that baade called the same region van tulder s pole .",
    "@xcite , a few years before , published an interesting paper concerning the location of the galactic pole by using different types of stars and open clusters .",
    "thus , we suggest that this low - reddening region should be defined as the van tulder - baade s ( vtb ) window",
    ".    this region is dominated by the presence of two galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) , namely 6528 and 6522 .",
    "the former is a very interesting cluster , since it is among the most metal - rich ggcs .",
    "spectroscopic investigations , based on high - resolution spectra , suggest for this cluster a solar metallicity and a modest @xmath3-element enhancement .",
    "@xcite , studying four red horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , found @xmath4 and a marginal @xmath3 enhancement ( @xmath5 ) , while @xcite investigated three giants belonging to hb and to the red giant branch ( rgb ) and found @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in a similar investigation , based on high - resolution near - infrared ( nir )",
    "spectra of four bright giants , @xcite found @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the above measurements indicate that 6528 is an ideal laboratory to constrain the possible occurrence of an age - metallicity relation among the most metal - rich and old ggcs @xcite . moreover ,",
    "6528 and its twin 6553 are considered the prototype metal - rich clusters of the galactic bulge @xcite and therefore , unique stellar systems to constrain the difference between cluster and field stars",
    ".    estimates of both structural parameters and intrinsic properties for 6528 are partially plagued by the high differential reddening across the field of view ( fov ) and by the strong level of contamination from bulge and disk stars .",
    "the effect of differential reddening and field - star contamination are among the reasons why age estimates for 6528 range from @xmath10gyr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on isochrones provided by @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) to @xmath11gyr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* isochrones by @xcite @xcite ) , to 12.6gyr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* isochrones by @xcite @xcite ) .    in principle , the combination of visual and nir photometry is an efficient diagnostic to separate candidate cluster and field stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , in many ggcs , field stars and cluster members use to populate different regions of the optical - nir color - color plane . unfortunately , the metallicity distribution of 6528 , bulge and thin - disk stars all peak around solar chemical composition , thus making 6528 almost indistinguishable from the field in many color - color plane .",
    "an alternative approach to separate field and cluster members is based on the analysis of stellar proper motions . a partial separation of 6528 field and cluster",
    "stars was performed for the first time by @xcite by using accurate astrometric measurements from multi - epoch images taken with the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) .",
    "a similar approach was also adopted by @xcite to constrain the bulge membership of 6553 .    in this investigation",
    ", we exploit the unique astrometric and photometric performance of the ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis / wfc3 ) , the infrared channel of wfc3 , ( ir / wfc3 ) and of the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) of _ hst _ to obtain high - accuracy astrometry and photometry of stars in the 6528 fov .",
    "proper motions derived from this dataset allowed us to separate , with unprecedented precision , most of the field stars from cluster members .",
    "the field - stars decontamination of the cmd allowed us to correct the photometry of 6528 for differential reddening , hence to derive an accurate age estimate by comparing the cmd of 6528 with isochrones .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we present both the optical and the nir data sets used in the current investigation together with the approach adopted to perform the photometry . the approach adopted to measure the proper motion and to select candidate cluster stars are discussed in subsection 2.1 , while the subsection 2.2 deals with the method adopted to estimate the differential reddening .",
    "the selection of the candidate field stars is presented in  3 , while in  4 we discuss the optical cmds of candidate field and cluster stars together with advanced evolutionary features ( red horizontal branch , rgb bump ) . in  5 we discuss in detail the comparison with two empirical calibrators : the old , metal - rich globular 47tuc and the super - metal - rich open cluster 6791 .",
    " 6 deals with the comparison with cluster isochrones and the difference with the age and the metallicity of the empirical calibrators .",
    "a brief summary of the results and a few possible avenues of the current project are outlined in  7 .",
    "the data presented in this investigation come from  archive images centered on 6528 .",
    "the advanced camera for survey / wide field camera ( acs / wfc ) dataset was collected on june 6th 2002  , in the filters @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) dataset was collected between june 26th and 27th 2010 and includes optical and nir images .",
    "the former were taken with the ultraviolet and visual channel ( wfc3/uvis )   in the filters @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the latter were taken with the wfc3 - infrared channel ( wfc3/ir ) in the filters @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the footprints of the different datasets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp ] .",
    "in addition , to compare the cmd of 6528 with that of the open cluster 6791 we used acs / wfc data in @xmath12 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath25 ) for 6791  .",
    "the photometric and astrometric reduction of acs data , extensively described in @xcite , makes use of all the exposures simultaneously to generate a single list of stars , which are measured independently in each image .",
    "the routines used in the reduction exploit the independent dithered pointings of each image and the knowledge of the point spread function ( psf ) to detect a star and avoid artifacts in the final star list .",
    "the reduction of the wfc3 images was performed with a software ( img2xym_wfc3 ) that is mostly based on img2xym_wfc @xcite .",
    "star fluxes and positions were corrected for pixel area and geometric distortions using the solution given by @xcite and finally calibrated into the vegamag as in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we selected a high - quality sample of stars , i.e. , relatively isolated with small photometric , astrometric and psf - fitting errors . for this selection we used the quality indices that our photometry software produces , in a procedure that is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "by adopting the above selection criteria , the @xmath2620% of candidate cluster stars was rejected .",
    "the sample of objects that was neglected from the analysis includes : i ) stars that are poorly measured due to contamination by cosmic rays or bad pixels ; ii ) stars that are poorly measured due to contamination by nearby neighbor stars .",
    "moreover , we also neglected non - stellar objects ( background galaxies ) , hot pixels and artifacts associated to diffraction spikes of bright stars  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "for these objects we are not able to properly estimate photometric and astrometric ( random and systematic ) errors , because their profiles can strongly differ from the adopted psf model .",
    "we ended up with an accurate photometric and astrometric catalog of @xmath27 stars in a magnitude interval ranging from nearly the tip of the rgb to several magnitudes fainter than the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) , reaching @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 versus @xmath30 cmd from wfc3/uvis data and the @xmath29 versus @xmath31 cmd from acs / wfc data are shown in fig .  [ cmds ] for stars in the 6528 fov .",
    "proper motions ( pms ) are obtained by comparing the position of stars measured at two different epochs , following an approach that has been already used in several papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the present analysis",
    "the average positions of the stars obtained by the optical acs data and by both optical and nir wfc3 data , represent , respectively , the positions at the first and second epoch .",
    "the computation of the geometric linear transformation between the coordinate system of the first- and second - epoch catalogs is crucial for the determination of the pm of the stars in our fov .",
    "therefore , we started off with the identification of the same stars detected in both the epochs .",
    "then , we picked up a subsample made up only by the ones unsaturated and with a high signal - to - noise ratio in all the acs and wfc3 images .",
    "moreover , since the cluster internal motions are negligible compared to the field star motions , we eventually decided to use cluster members as reference stars to define the transformation we are looking for .    in order to select the sample of cluster members as reference stars",
    ", we started by identifying all the stars that , on the basis of their position in the cmd , are probable cluster members , and obtained a raw proper - motion estimate by using a local transformation based on this sample .",
    "as an example of the criteria of selection we used , in the bottom - left panel of fig .  [ pmsel ] we plotted with black points all the stars that are used as reference to obtain the first proper motion estimate .",
    "the same stars are plotted with the same color code in the vector - point diagram ( vpd ) shown in the top - left panel .",
    "it is clear that the pm of some reference stars is not consistent with their cluster membership .    at this point",
    ", we drew the red circle which has a radius @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average pm dispersion for reference stars in each direction and contains the bulk of cluster stars .",
    "we excluded from the sample of reference stars all the stars that lie outside the red circle and do not have cluster - like proper motion even if they are placed near the cluster sequence .",
    "this ensures that the relative motion of the cluster stars is zero within the measurement errors .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] . in the bottom - left panel we plotted the vpd of the proper motions in galactic coordinates for stars located across the acs fov of 6528 : since proper motions were measured relative to a sample of cluster members , the zero point of the motion is the mean motion of the cluster .",
    "a zoomed vpd around the origin is shown in the inset .",
    "the bulk of stars clustered around ( @xmath34 ) = ( 0 , 0 ) mainly includes candidate cluster members while field stars are distributed over a broad range of pms .    in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] a smoothed version of the vpd is plotted , and the contours are superimposed onto the diagram . the proper - motion distribution of field stars is far from being symmetric across the four quadrants .",
    "the left quadrants ( ii and iii ) show clear overdensities when compared with the right quadrants ( i and iv ) and the density of the field stars is maximum in the third quadrant as indicated by the contours .",
    "this evidence is also supported by the marginals of the distribution drawn in the top - left ( @xmath35 ) and in the bottom - right ( @xmath36 ) panel .",
    "the above distributions are skewed , and indeed the slopes at positive galactic longitudes and negative latitudes are steeper , respectively , than at negative and positive ones .",

    "the same outcome applies to spectroscopic observations , and indeed , @xcite found @xmath123 , while @xcite and @xcite found @xmath124 .",
    "independent constraints will require accurate and deep nir photometry and larger samples of high - resolution spectra .",
    "on the basis of a large set of optical and near - infrared images collected with acs / wfc , wfc3/uvis , and wfc3/ir on board the hst , we performed deep and precise photometry of the galactic globular 6528 .",
    "current data set covers a time interval of almost ten years and allowed us to perform accurate proper motion measurements over the entire fov of the above images .",
    "the proper motions were used to separate candidate field and cluster stars .",
    "moreover , we also performed detailed estimates of the reddening map over the entire field of view of the above images and provided reddening corrections for individual objects .",
    "the proper motion selection and the correction for differential reddening brought forward very accurate and deep cmds for both field and cluster stars .",
    "this applies not only to evolved evolutionary features ( red horizontal branch , red clump , rgb bump ) , but also to ms stars fainter than the msto .",
    "the comparison with empirical calibrators ( 47tuc , 6791 ) and with cluster isochrones indicate that 6528 is an old ggc with super - solar iron abundance . together with 47tuc",
    ", it seems to belong to the group of old ggcs that are characterized by a minimal dispersion in age and no evidence of an age - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "the above findings together with the solid empirical evidence of an overabundance of @xmath3-elements in field bulge stars over the entire metallicity range @xcite further support the hypothesis that the high rate of star formation in the innermost regions of the bulge caused , in the first @xmath26 1gyr , a fast chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium .    our findings concerning 6528 , support previous results from different authors on a rapid chemical enrichment of the bulge .",
    "in particular , a thorough high - spectral - resolution spectroscopic survey of the galactic bulge ( argos ) was recently performed by @xcite and @xcite . on the basis of the metallicity distribution function and of the kinematic properties of a large sample of rc stars they found that the metal - rich stellar component ( [ fe / h ] @xmath125 ) is associated with the boxy / peanut @xcite bulge ( components a , b ) , while the metal - poor component ( [ fe / h ] @xmath126 ) is associated with both the galactic metal - intermediate thick disc and the metal - poor halo ( components c , d , e ) .",
    "the bulge stellar components include two spatially and chemically distinct sub - populations : i ) a thin more metal - rich sub - sample ( [ fe / h ] @xmath127 0.15 ) that is kinematically colder and closer to the galactic plane .",
    "this component is associated to the thin disc of the galaxy ( a component ) .",
    "ii ) a thick , more metal - poor sub - sample ( [ fe / h ] @xmath128 ) that is uniformly distributed across the selected fields .",
    "this component is associated to the boxy / peanut bulge and it is considered the tracer of the pristine bulge stellar population .",
    "it is also characterized by a large vertical distribution formed via an early disc instability that dragged the first generation of the thin disc stars into the boxy / peanut bulge structure @xcite .",
    "it goes without saying that current empirical scenario concerning the metallicity distribution of bulge stars awaits for a comprehensive analysis of the iron distribution and of the @xmath3-element distribution of stellar tracers tightly connected with the pristine stellar population of the bulge , namely blue / red horizontal branch stars and rrlyr  stars .",
