    "during an inflationary stage driven by the potential energy of a classical scalar field , the temperature of the universe was redshifted to almost zero .",
    "thus a mechanism to raise the temperature of the universe at the end of the inflationary stage is required to match this scenario with the standard hot big bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "currently it is assumed that soon after the end of inflation , the scalar field began to oscillate near the minimum of its effective potential .",
    "decay of this scalar field through particle production and thermalization of its energy with a huge increase in temperature and large entropy production , occurred during the reheating period .",
    "it started with violent particle production through parametric resonance , also called the preheating process , and lead to a highly nonequilibrium distribution of the produced particles , subsequently relaxing to an equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will consider the decay of the massive homogeneous inflaton scalar field @xmath0 coupled with light bosons @xmath1 , as it arises in chaotic inflationary models .",
    "a detailed quantum mechanical analysis is quite complicated and involves taking into account nonlinear processes , backreaction effects , rescattering , etc @xcite .",
    "further , since particles created during the preheating stage are far from equilibrium , their thermalization is achieved via collisional relaxation .",
    "this process of thermalization has not been understood yet from first principles @xcite . here ,",
    "we follow an alternative description of the physics , and instead of both fields and their interaction we consider an effective , phenomenological model in terms of an out - of - equilibrium mixture of two reacting fluids within the framework of relativistic irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the difference in the equations of state of the fluid components and the simultaneous deviation from the detailed balance in the rate equations for the interfluid reactions give rise to an entropy production effect that manifests itself as a reactive bulk pressure @xcite .",
    "this two - fluid model can be described in the effective one - fluid picture , based on a single temperature that we identify with the temperature of the reheating process .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that it is possible to treat selfconsistently the dynamics of geometry and matter @xcite .    in this phenomenological approach",
    "we ignore microscopic details and concentrate on most relevant macroscopic magnitudes like particle number density , temperature , entropy production .",
    "the net effect of the interaction term between both fields is collected in the particle number rate of change , and the finite temperature takes into account the backreaction effect of the produced particles .",
    "a phenomenological approach was initially proposed in @xcite .",
    "the methods used in that paper for the solution of the evolution equations lead to a vanishing bulk viscous contribution to the speed of sound .",
    "however their model depends strongly on this contribution so that their procedure of calculation needs to be improved . in this direction",
    "we introduce a physically founded perturbative scheme that yields more satisfactory results .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the two - fluid magnitudes and section 3 presents main equations of the model in the one - temperature picture . in section 4",
    "we introduce an expansion in powers of a parameter that measures de departure from perfect fluid behavior .",
    "this allows us to solve the system of equations order by order . in section 5 the model with a linear ansatz for the decay rate",
    "is solved , and we show that it reaches the reheating temperature only for very large times .",
    "we propose in section 6 a quadratic ansatz for the decay rate that is better motivated both from microphysical and geometrical point of view .",
    "we investigate thoroughly the evolution of the physical magnitudes and we find that the behavior of this model is very interesting .",
    "finally , conclusions are stated in section 7 .",
    "for the two - fluid model we assume that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 splits into two perfect fluid parts ,    @xmath3    with ( @xmath4 )    @xmath5    @xmath6 is the energy density and @xmath7 is the equilibrium pressure of species @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that both components share the same @xmath9-velocity @xmath10 .",

    "we are interested in situations where neither the particle numbers nor the energy - momenta of the components are separately conserved .",
    "the balance laws for the particle numbers are    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the fluid expansion and @xmath18 is the rate of change of the number of particles of species @xmath8 .",
    "there is particle production for @xmath19 and particle decay for @xmath20 , respectively . for @xmath21",
    ", we have separate particle number conservation .",
    "interactions between the fluid components amount to the mutual exchange of energy and momentum .",
    "consequently , there will be no local energy - momentum conservation for the subsystems separately .",
    "only the energy - momentum tensor of the system as a whole is conserved .",
    "denoting the loss- and source - terms in the separate balances by @xmath22 , we write    @xmath23    implying    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    all the considerations to follow will be independent of the specific structure of the @xmath26 .",
    "each component is governed by a separate gibbs equation    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the entropy per particle of species @xmath8 . using eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) one finds for the time behaviour of the entropy per particle    @xmath29    with nonvanishing source terms in the balances for @xmath15 and @xmath30 , the change in the entropy per particle is different from zero in general .",
    "the equations of state of the fluid components are assumed to have the general form    @xmath31    and    @xmath32    i.e. , particle number densities @xmath33 and temperatures @xmath34 are regarded as the basic thermodynamical variables .",
    "the temperatures of the fluids are different in general .    differentiating relation ( [ 15 ] ) , using the balances ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] )",
    "as well as the general relation    @xmath35    that follows from the requirement that the entropy is a state function , we find the following expression for the temperature behaviour @xcite :    @xmath36    the entropy flow vector @xmath37 is defined by    @xmath38    and the contribution of component @xmath8 to the entropy production density becomes    @xmath39    where relation ( [ 13 ] ) has been used .    according to eq.([9 ] ) the condition of energy - momentum conservation for the system as a whole ,    @xmath40    implies    @xmath41    there is no corresponding condition , however , for the particle number balance as a whole .",

    "its oscillation amplitude @xmath73 falls off as @xmath74 and its mean energy density @xmath75 decreases as @xmath76 , in the same way as pressureless dust @xcite .",
    "hence we represent the massive inflaton field as a fluid , named @xmath77 , of nonrelativistic particles with mass @xmath72 , energy density @xmath78 , pressure @xmath79 and number density @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay products of the scalar field @xmath0 are ultrarelativistic for @xmath81 , and we model them as an ideal relativistic fluid of massless particles , with energy density @xmath82 , equilibrium pressure @xmath83 and particle density @xmath84 .",
    "we also assume that both fluids are classical and ideal and that each species remain in thermal equilibrium along the reheating process .",
    "that is , we neglect dissipative effects for each of the fluids in comparison with particle production effects .",
    "we have also the effective one - temperature alternative description of a two - component fluid that is based on a single gibbs - equation for the system as a whole :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the equilibrium pressure , @xmath87 is the energy density and @xmath88 is the entropy per particle .",

    "an ( approximate ) equilibrium for the entire system is assumed to be established through the interactions between the subsystems on the right - hand side of the balances ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) . in this picture",
    "the cosmic fluid splits into two effective fluid components whose equations of state are assumed to have the same form as those of the `` real '' fluids , but shear this common temperature .",

    "as long as the pressures are those for classical gases , @xmath98 , the equilibrium pressure @xmath86 of the system as a whole depends on @xmath99 only and the separate dependence on @xmath100 on the right - hand side of eq.([36 ] ) may be omitted .    for components out of equilibrium ,",
