    "clusters of galaxies are valuable cosmological probes . as the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe , they play a key role in the tracing and modeling of large scale structure formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of our rapidly expanding sample of known clusters , finding efficient means of estimating cluster properties is a highly desirable goal .",
    "the contribution of cluster studies to the field of observational cosmology hinges on our ability to accurately estimate cluster masses .",
    "in particular , through the determination of both gas mass and total mass , cluster analysis can lead to estimations of the cosmological mass density , @xmath18 , while accurate measurement of the evolution of the cluster mass function provides important constraints on both the normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the dark energy equation of state  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , gaining an understanding of the evolution of x - ray scaling relationships ( such as @xmath11-@xmath12 and m-@xmath12 ) with redshift provides an important contribution to our ability to accurately model the evolution of large - scale structure in the universe  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "intermediate redshift ( @xmath21 ) clusters are well situated for the study of cluster properties .",
    "they are compact enough to be observed without tedious mosaicing , and they are present in statistically significant numbers .",
    "intermediate redshift clusters are also luminous enough to permit detailed investigation , with the potential for placing strong contraints on cluster evolution",
    ".    three frequently applied approaches to estimating cluster masses are gravitational lens modeling , optical spectroscopic measurements of the cluster galaxy velocity dispersion , and characterizing x - ray emission as a means of tracing the underlying potential well of the cluster .",
    "each of these methods uses different observations and assumptions , which can be tested through their direct comparison .",
    "an alternate optical approach to the efficient estimation of cluster masses involves the use of optical richness .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that galaxy light is a reliable tracer of total cluster mass , and requires calibration via other methods .",
    "lensing mass estimates test both the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and our knowledge of the mass distribution in clusters . because they probe all of the projected mass along the line of sight , which may include additional mass concentrations , they are susceptible to overestimation of cluster mass  @xcite .",
    "dynamical mass estimates work under the assumption that velocity dispersion is directly related to the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "pitfalls of this technique also include the danger of overestimating the cluster mass in cases where substructure or mergers drive up velocity dispersion measurements  @xcite",
    ".    the hot , diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) , which is observed in the x - ray , should be a direct tracer of a cluster s underlying potential well . under assumptions of isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium , the surface brightness of a cluster of galaxies can provide information on gas density as well as total gravitating mass .",
    "factors that influence the accuracy of x - ray mass estimates are temperature gradients , substructure , and mergers , which can compromise the previously stated assumptions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is to identify , through direct comparison , any systematic biases in these methods with the ultimate goal of determining a robust calibration between optical richness and cluster mass .",
    "optical richness measurements are easily available due to the fact that their estimation requires very little observing time . therefore an accurate calibration of the relationship between mass and optical richness would allow us to determine the masses of large samples of clusters in a highly efficient manner , providing strong constraints on the evolution of the cluster mass function and , consequently , key cosmological parameters .    in this paper we present a detailed analysis of high resolution chandra x - ray observations of 14 cnoc  @xcite clusters at z @xmath22 . in sections",
    "[ s : obs]-[s : spect ] we probe the temperature , metallicity , morphology , and surface brightness of the hot icm present in each cluster . from this initial analysis",
    ", we derive mass estimates ( section  [ s : mass ] ) which are compared to dynamical and weak lensing mass estimates ( section  [ s : masscomp ] ) , and then we examine the x - ray scaling laws of our sample ( section  [ s : laws ] ) .",

    "the double @xmath1-model has the form @xmath36 where each component has fit parameters @xmath37 .    though a fair number of the clusters in our sample posess detectably elliptical or irregular emission , circular surface brightness profiles were chosen based on a number of factors",
    "first , as discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , differences in masses derived using elliptical vs. circular @xmath1 profiles are small ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "secondly , circular @xmath1 profiles provide a more straightforward comparison between dynamical and x - ray derived masses , since dynamical mass calculations assume sphericity .",
    "finally , temperature uncertainties should outweigh any errors introduced by assuming radial symmetry .",
    "the parameters of the best fitting single @xmath1 model of each cluster are shown in table [ table2 ] .",
    "while nine of the clusters surface brightness profiles do not exhibit excess unmodeled emission in their cores when fit with a single @xmath1 model , five of the clusters do exhibit excess emission in their cores .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of these clusters are better fit with the addition of a second @xmath1 component .",
    "all of the clusters requiring a double @xmath1 model are believed to contain cooling flows : abell 2390 , ms0440 + 02 , ms0839 + 29 , ms1358 + 62 , and ms1455 + 22  @xcite and exhibit strong ( @xmath39}>10^{42}~\\rm{erg}~\\rm{s}^{-1}$ ] ) extended h@xmath40 emission  @xcite .",

    "for the purpose of fitting cluster scaling relationships within a well defined region of mass overdensity , global cluster properties were determined for our sample within @xmath3 . using the fitted x - ray centroid positions obtained in section  [ s : obs ] ( with the exception of ms0451 + 02 , as noted in section  [ s : obs ] )",
    ", a spectrum was extracted from each cleaned event file in a circular region with a @xmath41 radius .",
    "these spectra were then analyzed with xspec 11.3.2  @xcite , using weighted response matrices ( rmfs ) and effective area files ( arfs ) generated with the ciao tool acisspec and the latest version of the chandra calibration database ( caldb 3.0.1 ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from the aimpoint chip as far away from the cluster as possible .",
    "each spectrum was grouped to contain at least 20 counts per energy bin .",
    "spectra were fitted with single temperature spectral models , inclusive of foreground absorption .",
    "each spectrum was initially fit with the absorbing column frozen at its measured value  @xcite , and redshifts were fixed throughout the analysis .",
    "metal abundances were allowed to vary . data with energies below 0.6 kev and above 7.0 kev were again excluded .    in some cases evidence of excess photoelectric absorption has been seen in cooling flow clusters  @xcite . to investigate this possibility",
    "a second fit was performed , allowing the absorbing column to vary .",
    "no evidence for excess absorption was found in 13 of the 14 clusters .",
    "the ms0440 + 02 spectrum , however , was equally well fit by a model inclusive of excess foreground absorption . the results of these fits , combined with the best fitting @xmath1 model parameters from section  [ s : sb ] , were then used to estimate the value of @xmath3 for each cluster .",
    "this is accomplished by combining the equation for total gravitating mass    @xmath42    ( where @xmath43 is the mean mass per particle ) with the definition of mass overdensity    @xmath44    where the critical density @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the cluster redshift , and @xmath47 is the factor by which the density at @xmath48 exceeds the critical density .",

    "this iterative process was continued until fitted temperatures and calculated values of @xmath3 were consistent with extraction radii .",
    "the results of this process , including values of @xmath3 , temperatures and abundances are shown in table  [ table4 ] , along with 90% confidence ranges .",
    "an additional process was carried out for the five cooling core clusters in our sample . using spatially resolved temperature profiles ( section  [ ss : annuli ] ) , the radius within which cooling became prominent in each cluster ( @xmath51 ) was estimated . a single annular spectrum",
    "was then extracted for each cluster from that radius to @xmath3 and fitted with single temperature spectral models .",
    "the observation of ms0440 + 02 did not possess enough signal to constrain a fit to the cooling flow excised spectrum , therefore it was discarded .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in table  [ table5 ] , along with inner extraction radii and calculated values of @xmath3 .",
    "overall , our integrated temperatures are comparable to the previous rosat results of  @xcite , though they are better constrained through chandra observations .",
    "more recent analyses of subsets of these clusters have been conducted with rosat  @xcite , asca  @xcite , and chandra  @xcite .",
    "our fitted temperatures are consistent within errors of the vast majority of the values reported in these papers .",
    "noticeable discrepancies arise occasionally in the case of cooling flow clusters ( where some of these authors have not excised the cooling flow contribution to integrated temperature ) and ms1008 - 1224 , for which we consistently derive a lower temperature than other studies .",
    "this is not surprising considering the irregular morphology of this cluster , and may be due to differences in the regions for which spectra were extracted .",
    "metallicities for this sample are consistent with an overall value of @xmath22 solar , as is seen in lower redshift clusters .",
    "this suggests that icm enrichment occurs early in a cluster s history , evidence which is corroborated by the work of  @xcite .      with the goal of elucidating the radial dependence of temperature for the clusters in our sample",
    ", spectra were extracted within circular annuli spanning the central @xmath52 of each cluster , depending on the signal - to - noise ratio of each observation .",
    "the extraction regions were sized to include at least 2500 counts per spectrum in the 0.6 - 7.0 kev band for each data set .",
    "this number was chosen as a minimum for achieving reasonable temperature constraints on the emission in each annulus .",
    "extractions were performed after the removal of previously detected point sources ( section  [ s : obs ] ) , using the ciao tool acisspec , which incorporates the changing response over large areas of the detector .",
    "three of the 14 clusters in this sample did not possess enough signal for more than one extraction region , and were removed from the sample during the subsequent spatial analysis .",
    "spectra from the eleven remaining clusters were then grouped to contain 20 counts per bin , and were analyzed using xspec .",
    "single temperature spectral models with fixed galactic absorption and varying abundances were fitted to the data .",
    "the results of these fits were used to create a temperature profile for each cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates the eleven resulting temperature profiles .",
    "it is clear from these figures that significant cooling cores are present in five of the clusters in this sample : abell 2390 , ms0440 + 02 , ms0839 + 29 , ms1358 + 62 , and ms1455 + 22 .",
    "these are the same five clusters which required double @xmath1 model fits to their surface brightness profiles ( section  [ s : sb ] ) .",
    "the remaining six temperature profiles are consistent with isothermality .",
    "the spatially resolved temperature profiles of the five cooling core clusters were scaled by @xmath3 and @xmath53 in an attempt to check their consistency with the universal temperature profile proposed by  @xcite . the combined data from these five clusters were then fit using the functional form @xmath54 $ ] , with @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this fit resulted in @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , with a reduced @xmath60 of 1.3 .",
    "these values are all consistent with the best fit found by  @xcite . the resulting function , however , does not asymptotically approach 1 at large radii , ostensibly due to the fact that these temperature profiles do not extend all the way to @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the individual temperature profiles as well as the binned and averaged temperature profile of the five clusters , with the best fitting functions overlayed .",
    "using the results of the spectral fits and @xmath1 model fits , along with equations  [ mass_eq ] ,  [ dens_eq ] , and  [ eq : ettori ] , gas masses and total masses were calculated out to both @xmath3 and @xmath61 for the clusters in our sample .",
    "central densities were determined via an expression relating the observable cluster x - ray luminosity to gas density , using emission measures obtained during spectral fitting in xspec .",
    "for the nine non - cooling core clusters , single temperature spectra fits and single @xmath1 model parameters were used . for the five clusters which exhibit significant cooling , spectral parameters from cooling core excised spectral fits were used , and @xmath1 and @xmath62 were taken from the results of double @xmath1 model fits .    to determine the effects of inner temperature gradients on total cluster mass ,",
    "least - squares fitting was performed on the temperature profiles obtained in section  [ ss : annuli ] for the five cooling core clusters .",
    "the resulting parameterizations were included in equation  [ mass_eq ] , and masses were calculated out to the edge of the cooling region ( table  [ table5 ] ) .",
    "masses were also calculated without the inclusion of this parameterization , and the results compared . according to the outcome of this exercise ,",
    "the inclusion of temperature gradients in mass calculations of the five cooling core clusters in our sample would result in , at most , a @xmath63 correction to the total mass within the cooling region .",
    "this correction is negligible compared to the other uncertainties in mass calculations and is therefore not included in the final results .",
    "an additional uncertainty is present in mass estimations of ms0451 + 0250 due to its significant irregularity . choosing a centroid at the center of the extended emission rather than one at the most central peak of emission produces a total mass which is greater by 25% .",
    "the beta parameter which results from using this centroid , however , is unusually high ( 1.9 ) .",
    "x - ray mass determinations are presented in tables  [ table6a ] and  [ table6 ] along with @xmath64 confidence intervals .",
    "under the assumption that clusters provide a fair representation of the universe , gas mass fractions , @xmath65 , defined as the ratio of cluster gas mass to total gravitating mass , were calculated for our sample within @xmath4 and are listed in table  [ table6 ] .",

    ", we calculate a cosmological mass density of @xmath72 ( 68% confidence , with error bars representing the formal error ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with wmap three year results  @xcite .",
    "comparisons between x - ray and dynamical masses for the cnoc sample were previously undertaken by  @xcite using rosat observations .",
    "while they found good agreement between the two methods of mass estimation , accurate surface brightness modeling and detailed investigations of cluster temperature gradients were unavailable due to the comparitively poor spatial resolution of rosat ( particularly at moderate redshift ) . here",
    "we utilize the @xmath73 spatital resolution of chandra to improve the accuracy of these initial comparisons .",
    "detailed dynamical studies of cnoc clusters were performed by  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides velocity dispersions obtained from cfht spectroscopy ,  @xcite adjusts these values by employing an improved interloper - removal algorithm , and  @xcite investigates the isotropicity and galaxy distribution of a composite cnoc cluster created via dimensionless scaling . here",
    "we will primarily draw from the work of  @xcite and  @xcite for our mass estimates .",
    "dynamical masses can be calculated from velocity dispersions via the jeans equation    @xmath74    where @xmath75 represents the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath76 is the galaxy number density profile , and @xmath1 represents the anisotropy of the system . according to  @xcite , the cnoc clusters can be treated as isotropic ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , and @xmath76 takes the form    @xmath78^{\\gamma-3},\\ ] ]    where the length scale of the mass distribution is set by the parameter @xmath79 , and @xmath80 represents the logarithmic power - law slope near the center .",

    ", dynamical masses were calculated for our sample out to @xmath61 ( as determined by x - ray parameters in section [ ss : integrated ] ) , using the velocity dispersions of  @xcite .",
    "these masses were then compared to x - ray derived masses from the previous section ( section  [ s : mass ] ) .",
    "a weighted average gives an overall dynamical to x - ray mass ratio of @xmath84 , where the error bar indicates the uncertainty in the mean .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] is a plot indicating the dynamical to x - ray mass ratio of each cluster in the sample .",
    "the high dynamical to x - ray mass ratios of ms1006.0 + 1202 and ms1008.1 - 1224 may be due to overestimated velocity dispersions of these objects , as they both have markedly irregular emission ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however we also see evidence of good agreement between x - ray and dynamical masses in irregular objects ( ms0451.5 + 0250 ) , as well as disagreement in some regular objects ( ms0839.8 + 2938 ) , therefore a clear pattern does not make itself evident . likewise ,",
    "cooling core objects show no obvious systematic departures from consistency .",
    "overall , dynamical and x - ray mass estimations for this sample show remarkable agreement .",
    "our resulting ratio of dynamical to x - ray masses is consistent with that quoted by  @xcite in their rosat study , however the scatter about the mean of our distribution is @xmath85 smaller .",
    "this decrease in scatter is indicative of the improved spatial and spectral resolution of chandra .",
    "in addition ,  @xcite systematically overestimate the core radii of cooling flow clusters , and therefore their masses , another result which is likely due to the poorer spatial resolution of rosat .",
    "weak lensing mass estimates were obtained for seven of the clusters in our sample using deep optical observations at the cfht 3.6 m telescope  ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) .",
    "the model - independent projected mass estimates that we employ in this paper were calculated for the inner @xmath86 of each cluster , using a cosmology of @xmath87 , @xmath24 and @xmath88 .    to compare x - ray derived masses to weak lensing masses , we calculated a cylindrical x - ray mass within @xmath89 .",

    "we estimate @xmath123 values by applying small corrections to the original @xmath108 values of the cnoc clusters  @xcite , based on their blue fractions  @xcite .",
    "most of the corrections are of the order of @xmath124 .",
    "values of @xmath123 ( in units of @xmath125 ) , as well as the cluster x - ray luminosities obtained in section  [ ss : integrated ] , are given in table  [ table9 ] .",
    "to keep the same scale as previous work using the @xmath108 parameter , they are computed using @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath108 has previously been shown to correlate strongly with the x - ray properties of clusters in this sample  @xcite . here",
    "we re - examine these correlations using improved x - ray data from chandra .",
    "extending the simple relationships expressed in  @xcite to @xmath123 we have    @xmath127    and using our best fit @xmath128 and mass@xmath102 relationships ( section  [ s : laws ] ) , in combination with equation  [ eq : txbgc ]    @xmath129    and    @xmath130    in this section we derive the best fitting relationships between cluster x - ray properties and @xmath123 for our sample .",
    "a generic form for these relationships of    @xmath131    is adopted , where x represents the particular property being fit . for @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath132 ,",
    "units of kev , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 were used , respectively . as in  @xcite , the bces estimator of  @xcite was employed .",

    "we have presented a comprehensive analysis of chandra observations of 14 medium redshift ( @xmath136 ) clusters of galaxies from the cnoc subsample of the emss ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "imaging analysis has provided information on the relative quiescence of each cluster ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of chandra has allowed us to determine the surface brightness profiles of these clusters down to @xmath31 scales ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this has enabled us to obtain precise models of cluster emission ( table  [ table2 ] ) , except in the case of ms0451 + 02 which displays a considerable amount of substructure .",
    "five clusters in our sample ( abell 2390 , ms0440 + 02 , ms0839 + 29 , ms1358 + 62 , and ms1455 + 22 ) exhibit excess emission in their cores , indicating the presence of cool gas .",
    "the surface brightnesses of these five clusters are better fit with the inclusion of a second @xmath1 component to model the excess core emission ( table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "chandra s @xmath73 spatial resolution has enabled us to study the radial distribution of temperatures on small scales ( @xmath137 kpc ) in the inner 150 - 600 kpc of eleven of these objects ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "while nine clusters in our sample have temperature profiles which are consistent with isothermality , the five cooling core clusters ( listed above ) show clear temperature gradients in their innermost @xmath138 kpc . the temperature profiles of these five clusters are consistent with the `` universal '' temperature profile of @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution of the instrument has provided well constrained spectral analyses of the central @xmath3 ( @xmath139 ) kpc of each object .",
    "temperatures obtained initially from 300 kpc radius extraction regions began an iterative spectral extraction and fitting process culminating in the determination of robust integrated temperatures , luminosities , and abundances within @xmath3 ( tables  [ table4 ] and  [ table5 ] ) . cooling core corrected spectra were used to determine global temperatures for the clusters in our sample which exhibit significant cooling .",
    "these temperatures were then employed in the spectral determination of integrated luminosities for these objects .",
    "overall , our sample displays temperatures in the range of @xmath140 kev , abundances which range from @xmath141 times the solar value , and unabsorbed bolometric luminosities within @xmath3 which span @xmath142 .",
    "cluster gas and total masses within @xmath3 and @xmath4 were estimated using the outcomes of spectral and surface brightness fitting , resulting in virialized cluster masses of @xmath143 ( table  [ table6 ] ) and respective cluster gas masses of @xmath144 .",
    "a weighted average of gas mass fractions gives @xmath145 , resulting in @xmath6 ( 68% confidence , formal error ) , this value is in good agreement with  @xcite .",
    "dynamical masses within @xmath4 were calculated via the jeans equation using velocity dispersions taken from  @xcite ( table  [ table7 ] ) .",
    "comparisons between x - ray masses and dynamical masses result in a weighted average of @xmath146 , indicating good agreement between between these two methods , however a fair amount of scatter is evident ( @xmath147 ; figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "dynamical masses are noticeably larger in the case of clusters which exhibit significant substructure ( ms1006 + 12 and ms1008 - 12 ) , a factor which may be responsible for an overestimation of velocity dispersions  @xcite .",
    "weak lensing masses within @xmath148 kpc were obtained for seven of the clusters in our sample .",
    "x - ray masses were calculated within this region and compared to the lensing results ( table  [ table8 ] ) . although the distribution appears somehwat asymmetric ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) , a weighted average gives @xmath149 , with a scatter of @xmath147 .",
    "x - ray scaling laws for this sample were investigated in a manner similar to  @xcite and  @xcite , taking cosmological factors into account . the best fitting @xmath92 relationship for our sample results in an intercept of @xmath150 and a slope of @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "while this slope is lower than some estimates  @xcite , it is consistent with both  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "moderate negative evolution is indicated by this index being greater than that predicted by self - similar models  @xcite .",
    "the mass-@xmath12 relationship for these clusters also exhibits a somewhat steeper slope than expected , at @xmath15 , with an intercept of @xmath151 ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .    the best fitting scaling laws for our sample ( listed above )",
    "were combined with equation  [ eq : txbgc ] , with the ultimate goal of calibrating relationships between red - sequence optical richness ( @xmath16 ) and global cluster parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath12 scales relatively well to @xmath16 with a @xmath152 scatter ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "@xmath17 shows a scatter of @xmath153 ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) , which is consistent with the @xmath12-@xmath16 scatter given that @xmath154 .",
    "the @xmath11-@xmath16 relationship exhibits a significantly larger scatter at @xmath155 ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that @xmath16 does exhibit intial promise as a mass indicator .",
    "accurate calibration of a relationship between optical richness and cluster mass will require the use of additional clusters which posess both well - constrained x - ray temperatures and optical richness measurements .",
    "overall we find that multiple cluster mass estimators - dynamics , weak lensing and x - ray observations , along with optical richness in the cluster red sequence - are converging for this sample of well - studied clusters .",
    "while individual correlations still have significant scatter , there is little evidence for large systematic bias in any of these methods .",
    "cluster characteristics which might be considered problematic for one or more techniques ( cluster substructure , merging , and/or the presence of a cool core ) appear to perturb these relationships relatively little , as long as high quality data are obtained and the analysis is tuned to correct for these . in particular the correlation between cluster temperature and optical richness ,",
    "the most easily obtained of the mass estimators , is promising .",
    "a remaining concern is that x - ray selected clusters may not prove to be typical of all massive clusters at these redshifts .",
    "additional checks involving clusters covering a broader range of redshift and selection technique ( e.g. , sz , optical , weak lensing ) will be necessary to solidify our understanding of the most reliable and efficient methods of cluster mass estimation .",
