    "@xcite ) . the difficulty to understand these deformations lies in the possibility of degenerating the structure .",

    "in fact , the works of kojima , hodgson - kerckhoff and fuji ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) show that the degeneration of the hyperbolic cone structures occurs if and only if the singular link of these structures intersects itself over the deformation .",
