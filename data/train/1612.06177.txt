    "in the study of swimming of a body immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid it may be assumed that the fluid flow is governed by the navier - stokes equations for flow velocity and pressure , and that a no - slip boundary condition holds at the body surface .",
    "the fluid is caused to move by periodic surface deformation of the body .",
    "theory must explain that on average over a period the body acquires a steady swimming velocity .",
    "it also must provide expressions for the swimming velocity and the required power .",
    "we assume in the following that the reynolds number is small , so that the flow remains laminar .",
    "this requires small amplitude of deformation .",
    "the reynolds number is defined as usual as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the swimming velocity , @xmath2 is the body length , and @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "to lowest order the swimming velocity is quadratic in the amplitude .",
    "a second independent parameter is the dimensionless viscosity . in the present context",
    "this is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wavenumber and @xmath6 is the frequency of surface deformation .",
    "the seminal work of taylor @xcite was concerned with the swimming of a planar sheet with transverse plane wave surface deformation .",
    "he considered small amplitude deformation , corresponding to small reynolds number , and the stokes limit of high viscosity .",
    "correspondingly the fluid equations of motion reduce to the stokes equations .",
    "taylor showed that to second order in the amplitude the swimming velocity is independent of viscosity .",
    "his work was generalized to the full range of dimensionless viscosity by reynolds @xcite and by tuck @xcite , who showed that then the swimming velocity depends on the dimensionless viscosity @xmath7 .",
    "taylor showed that in the stokes limit the mean lateral force per unit area exerted by the pressure on the surface cancels against the mean force exerted by the viscous stress .",
    "this may be taken to imply that the mean thrust cancels against the mean drag .",
    "conversely the force per unit area exerted by the sheet on the fluid vanishes . at smaller values of @xmath7",
    "the fluid is subject in addition to reynolds stress , but the corresponding net mean force on the fluid per unit area again vanishes , as is seen by integration .",
    "tuck @xcite studied the effect of fluid inertia and considered also longitudinal plane wave squirming type surface deformations . in the stokes limit the corresponding swimming velocity is in the opposite direction to that for transverse deformation .",
    "the swimming velocity depends again on the dimensionless viscosity @xmath7 , and the net force exerted on the fluid per unit area vanishes .",
    "blake @xcite , brennen @xcite , and childress @xcite studied flow generated by waving cilia with an envelope represented by a surface with deformations intermediate between transverse and longitudinal .",
    "we showed earlier in the stokes limit that in the case of a sheet such intermediate surface deformation leads to an asymmetry between upper and lower half - space @xcite .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the model and necessitates consideration of a body of finite size .",
    "we considered a circular disk and argued that the asymmetry corresponds to a mean rotational swimming velocity @xcite .",
    "the rotational velocity follows from the requirement that besides the net mean force also the net mean torque exerted on the fluid vanish .    in the following we consider arbitrary values of the dimensionless viscosity @xmath7 and a planar sheet with deformation given by an elliptically polarized surface wave .",
    "there is an asymmetry between upper and lower half - space , except in the extreme limits considered by tuck @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions are derived for the mean translational and rotational swimming velocity and the power for an elliptical disk of size much larger than the wavelength of deformation .",
    "the results may be compared with those derived for a slab with symmetric surface deformation leading to symmetry of the flow on both sides @xcite .",
    "we consider an elliptical disk immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath8 and mass density @xmath9 .",
    "the rest shape of the disk is denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "the fluid is set in motion by time - dependent distortions of the disk .",
    "we assume that the distortions are periodic in time with period @xmath11 .",
    "we consider a prescribed time - dependent shape @xmath12 leading to swimming motion .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath13 and the pressure @xmath14 in the rest frame of the disk satisfy the navier - stokes equations with an added coriolis force term @xcite corresponding to the mean rotational swimming velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the surface displacement @xmath16 is defined as the vector distance @xmath17 of a point @xmath18 on the displaced surface @xmath12 from the point @xmath19 on the disk @xmath10 .",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath13 is required to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition @xmath20    we construct an approximate perturbative solution to the navier - stokes equations with boundary condition ( 2.2 ) by formal expansion @xcite of the flow velocity and the pressure in powers of @xmath21 , @xmath22 correspondingly the mean translational and rotational swimming velocities are expanded as @xmath23 the flow velocity at the surface is formally expanded as @xmath24 with the aid of this expansion the boundary condition may be applied at the undisplaced surface .    to first order the fluid equations of motion reduce to the linearized navier - stokes equations @xmath25 the first order boundary condition is @xmath26 the first order mean swimming velocities @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish .    to second order the time - averaged flow @xmath29 satisfies the inhomogeneous stokes equations @xcite @xmath30 with force density @xmath31 where the overline indicates averaging over a period @xmath11 .",

    "<S> the swimming of an elliptical disk at small reynolds number is studied on the basis of a perturbative solution of the navier - stokes equations for fluid flow near a deformable infinite sheet . a stroke involving an elliptically polarized plane surface wave </S>",
    "<S> is studied , in extension of work by taylor and tuck . in general the elliptic polarization of the stroke </S>",
    "<S> leads to an asymmetry of the flow in the upper and lower half - space . on the basis of results for an infinite sheet expressions for the mean translational and rotational swimming velocity of an elliptical disk of size much larger than the wavelength of the stroke are deduced . </S>",
    "<S> in addition expressions are derived for the mean power and the efficiency of swimming . </S>"
