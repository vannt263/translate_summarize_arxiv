    "an _ unknotting operation _ is a pattern of local transformation on knot diagrams such that any knot diagram can be transformed into a trivial knot diagram by a finite sequence of this pattern and reidemeister moves i , ii and iii .",
    "unknotting operations play important roles in knot theory , and many unknotting operations are studied .",
    "for example , it is known that a _ delta move _ and a _ @xmath0-move _ as indicated in figure [ local ] are unknotting operations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is also known that an _",
    "@xmath1-gon move _ as indicated in figure [ local ] is an unknotting operation @xcite , @xcite .        in a seminar in osaka city university ,",
    "k. kishimoto proposed a local transformation on a knot or link diagram named region crossing change whose definition is as follows : let @xmath2 be a link diagram on @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the four - valent graph obtained from @xmath2 by replacing each crossing point with a vertex .",
    "we call each component of @xmath5 a _ region _ of @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that @xmath2 with @xmath6 crossings has @xmath7 edges and therefore @xmath8 regions because of euler characteristic .",
    "for example , the diagram @xmath2 in figure [ rcc - ex ] has five regions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "region crossing change _ at a region @xmath11 of @xmath2 is defined to be the crossing changes at all the crossing points on @xmath12 .",
    "for example in figure [ rcc - ex ] , we obtain @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) from @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) by applying a region crossing change at @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) .",
    "we remark that a @xmath0-move and an @xmath1-gon move on a knot diagram are region crossing changes .",
    "kishimoto raised the following question : _ is a region crossing change on a knot diagram an unknotting operation ? _ that is , can we transform any diagram into a diagram of the trivial knot by region crossing changes without reidemeister moves ?",
    "we remark that for a link diagram , the answer to the above question is negative .",
    "for example , the link diagram in figure [ hopf ] can not be deformed into a diagram of a trivial link by any region crossing change .",
    "we have the following theorem :    let @xmath2 be a knot diagram , and @xmath6 a crossing point of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the diagram obtained from @xmath2 by a crossing change at @xmath6 .",
    "then , there exist region crossing changes which deform @xmath2 into @xmath13 . [ mainthm ]",
    "the proof is given in section [ proof - s ] . since a crossing change on knot diagram is an unknotting operation , we have the following corollary which answers to kishimoto s question :    a region crossing change on a knot diagram is an unknotting operation .",
