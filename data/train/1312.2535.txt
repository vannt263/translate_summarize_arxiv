    "many proposed applications of nanoscale superconductors require understanding of how these systems behave under currents close to the critical .",
    "for instance , in designing superconducting qubits , it is essential to know how to use current to suppress the potential barrier separating the basis states .",
    "the best studied example of nanoscale superconductor is a point - like weak link  a josephson junction ( jj ) .",
    "it can often be described by a single - degree of freedom @xmath0the phase difference between the leads ",
    "subject to a `` tilted washboard '' potential v ( ) = - v_0 - i .",
    "[ wash ] here @xmath1 is the electric current in units of @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the electron charge . for _",
    "static _ @xmath0 ( when @xmath4 equals the total energy of the system ) , variation of ( [ wash ] ) produces the equation @xmath5 , showing that the current @xmath1 is due to a gradient of the phase , that is , @xmath1 is entirely a supercurrent : @xmath6 . for a time - dependent @xmath0 ,",
    "however , the current contains both superconducting and normal components .",
    "thus , in general i = i_s + i_n .",
    "[ i ] the normal component @xmath7 includes not only the normal current through the jj itself ( due , for instance , to thermal quasiparticles ) but also currents through various external resistors ( `` shunts '' ) connected in parallel to it .",
    "this is because all such currents couple to @xmath8 via voltage fluctuations , which are proportional to the time derivative of @xmath0 .    for any @xmath9 , the potential ( [ wash ] ) has infinitely many minima , equally spaced by @xmath10 , and important fluctuations are those that take the system from one minimum to the next .",
    "these are known as phase slips .",
    "each phase slip generates a voltage spike in the external circuit .",
    "if such spikes occur at a non - negligible rate , at a finite @xmath1 they will produce a nonzero time - averaged voltage , i.e. , a finite resistance .",
    "recently , a number of experimental techniques have been developed for synthesizing systems in which superconductivity is one - dimensional  superconducting ( sc ) nanowires .",
    "these techniques , described in the books , result in wires of uniform thickness with linear cross - sectional dimensions of a few nanometers . for such thin wires , one can assume that sc properties ( e.g. , the supercurrent density ) depend only on the lengthwise direction , even though the electron density of states still retains the 3d character .",
    "these novel systems promise a potentially new class of devices for control of superconductivity by current .    even though we do not expect the model ( [ wash ] ) to apply literally to the case of wires",
    ", some of the notions discussed above do carry over .",
    "the phase of the order parameter , @xmath11 , is now a function of the coordinate @xmath12 along the wire and time @xmath13 .",
    "the supercurrent is proportional to the gradient of the phase : @xmath14 . for states where @xmath15 is a continuous function of @xmath12",
    ", we can identify the winding number as w(t ) = [ w ] ( @xmath16 is the length of the wire ) and a phase slip as an event that changes @xmath17 by @xmath18 . there is a novel aspect to a phase slip in a wire ( as opposed to the case of jj ) , which has to do with the continuity of @xmath15 .",
    "namely , the process now occurs locally , at some point @xmath12 , where the order parameter momentarily vanishes , allowing the phase to unwind @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of jj , one can imagine a nanowire shunted by various external impedances , resulting in a normal current connected in parallel to the superconducting one , for the total given by the same eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) . in this paper , however , we wish to consider the possibility of an _ intrinsic _ resistive effect , namely , a normal component that is formed in the wire itself ( and , unlike thermal quasiparticles , survives in the limit @xmath19 ) .",
    "such a resistor will remain even in a wire effectively decoupled from any external dissipative environment , for example , in a sc loop operated via inductive coupling to a coil .    for a nanowire",
    ", one can consider , at least theoretically , two extreme limits .",
    "one is the clean limit  a perfectly uniform wire without disorder ; the other is the dirty limit  a wire with strong disorder scattering .",
    "the second limit is presumably more realistic , but the first is simpler and , as such , may be a useful starting point . in this paper , we consider the clean limit exclusively .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to @xmath20 , where the question of existence of an intrinsic normal component is in a sense the sharpest , although the method we propose is applicable also at @xmath21 .    as in a jj , the sc and normal components in a wire",
    "are coupled via phase slips .",
    "the clean limit is momentum - conserving , so the momentum unwound by a phase slip from the supercurrent must be picked up , in its entirety , by the normal component .",
    "the latter may in principle include small oscillations of the sc density ( the plasma waves ) , which , similarly to waves in a waveguide , are characterized by a finite impedance , but a more detailed study shows that there is a quantum anomaly involved , and each phase slip produces , via level crossing , fermionic quasiparticles , in precisely the right number to account for conservation of momentum @xcite .",
    "the requirement of quasiparticle production affects the energy balance in a phase slip : for the process to occur spontaneously , the energy unwound from the supercurrent must be enough to offset the cost of the produced fermions . in mean - field theory ,",
    "the free energy unwound from a loop of length @xmath16 gives directly the supercurrent : i_s = , [ unw ] where @xmath17 is the winding number ( [ w ] ) .",
    "so , one may suppose that phase slips become more favorable at larger @xmath8 .",
    "while that is true to a degree , a direct calculation shows that , within mean - field theory , the energy @xmath22 is never large enough  that is not until @xmath8 reaches the depairing current @xmath23 .",
    "the question we wish to ask is whether this conclusion is a mean - field artifact ; in other words , whether a window in which sc and normal components can coexist will open ( below @xmath23 ) once electron - electron interactions are fully taken into account .",
    "one possible way to answer this question is to construct a superconductor from strings and branes and go over to the strong - coupling ( large @xmath24 ) limit , in which @xmath24 coincident branes behave as a classical gravitating object @xcite ; such an alternative description of a quantum system is know as a gravity dual . a well - known example of gauge / gravity duality is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , for which a `` holographic '' dictionary connecting the two sides of the duality has been established @xcite .",
    "calculations using a gravity dual , however , are possible even in cases where a complete dictionary is not known , as long as one concentrates on those quantities that can in fact be unambiguously defined on the gravity side .",
    "the quantity we are interested in here is the energy of the ground state , @xmath25 , as a function of the momentum of the sc component , @xmath26 , at fixed total momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the difference p_n = p - p_s [ pn ] can then be attributed to the normal component .",
    "this can be seen as a clean - limit version of the formula ( [ i ] ) .",
    "a ground state with both component present corresponds to a minimum of @xmath25 for which both @xmath26 and @xmath28 are nonzero .",
    "a brane construction suitable for modeling a sc nanowire has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a system of d3 and d5 branes in type iib string theory . ) . ]",
    "the key aspects of it are as follows :    \\(i ) the setup contains a large number @xmath24 of coincident d3 branes and a d5 probe intersecting them over a line .",
    "this breaks all supersymmetries .",
    "the direction along the line , @xmath29 , corresponds to the direction of the wire , and the two directions transverse to all branes , @xmath30 , to the sc order parameter .",
    "( ii ) @xmath24 is identified with the number of occupied channels ( transverse wavefunctions ) in the wire , @xmath31 .",
    "is proportional to the cross - sectional area of the wire and in practice is of order of a few thousand , for the thinnest wires available .",
    "the large value reflects the 3d character of the electron density of states ; this is in contrast to sc properties , which vary only along @xmath12 . ]",
    "( iii ) supercurrent corresponds to the d5 winding around the d3s as one moves along @xmath12 . if the branes actually intersect , the low - energy spectrum of 3/5 strings contains @xmath24 species of massless ( 1 + 1)-dimensional fermions ( both left and right movers ) . at low values of @xmath27 , however , the intersection is unstable , and the d5 moves a finite distance away from the d3s ; this corresponds to a fully gapped , supercurrent - only state .",
    "supercurrent - only solutions have been found in @xcite .",
    "the chern - simons term in the d5 action has the effect that the solution with winding number @xmath17 carries @xmath32 units of the d5 worldvolume charge .",
    "a phase slip corresponds to the d5 crossing the d3s , with @xmath17 changing by one .",
    "conservation of charge then implies that @xmath24 fundamental strings , stretching between the d5 and and the d3s , must be produced .",
    "this can be seen , on the one hand , as a version of the hanany - witten effect @xcite in string theory ( creation of branes and strings at intersections ) and , on the other , as a parallel to the requirement of quasiparticle production noted earlier .",
    "this parallel allows one to identify the worldvolume charge with the supercurrent momentum @xmath26 ( which , for a supercurrent - only state , is also the total momentum ) , as follows : p_s = n w , [ nw ] where by convention @xmath26 is in units of the fermi momentum . instead of @xmath17 , we will often use the winding number density q = 2w / l , [ q ] where an extra factor @xmath10 is added for convenience .    in the leading large-@xmath24 limit ,",
    "supercurrent - only solutions exist for all @xmath33 , no matter how large . at @xmath33 above a certain @xmath34 , however , phase slips become energetically favorable , and the supercurrent - only state unstable .",
    "the instability has nothing to do with depairing .",
    "indeed , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the length scale of the d3 metric ( the only length scale seen by classical gravity ) .",
    "meanwhile , the value @xmath37 corresponding to depairing is of order of the gap @xmath38 , i.e. , of order @xmath36 in units of the string tension .",
    "one sees that the ratio @xmath39 scales to infinity in the large @xmath24 limit .",
    "instability of the supercurrent - only state at @xmath40 means that for p > p_m = n q_m l / 2 [ pm ] not all of the total momentum @xmath27 in the true ground state is carried by supercurrent ; some must be carried by quasiparticles . on the other hand ,",
    "we find that the normal - only state is unstable for any @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that , at @xmath27 exceeding the bound ( [ pm ] ) , supercurrent and quasiparticles must coexist in some mixed state .    a priori",
    ", it is not clear what the nature of the mixed state is and , in particular , if it can be described by a uniform ( in @xmath12 ) time - independent solution of dual gravity ( as the supercurrent - only state could ) .",
    "nevertheless , looking for such solutions is a natural first step , and that is what we describe in this paper .",
    "we find that , for a given total @xmath27 , a uniform time - independent solution exists for all @xmath26 between the value at which the normal - only state first becomes unstable and the maximum @xmath41 .",
    "for these solutions , the d5 crosses the d3s horizon ; we argue their existence by considering the near - horizon limit and by numerical evidence .",
    "we find , however , that the free energy of such a solution is never a convex function of @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the uniform mixed state is unstable towards phase separation , fragmenting eventually , we believe , into an `` emulsion '' of quasiparticle - rich droplets in a nearly quasiparticle - free matrix . some implications of this picture are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "the 10-dimensional metric sourced by @xmath24 coincident extremal d3 branes in type iib supergravity is @xcite ds^2 = ( - dt^2 + ( d x^i)^2 ) + ( d^2 + ^2 d_3 ^ 2 + d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) .",
    "[ ds2 ] the coordinates along the d3s are @xmath13 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "thus , @xmath15 is equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "the metric function @xmath49 depends only on @xmath50 and equals f(r ) = 1 + = 1 + , [ f ] where r^4 = 4g_s ( )^2 n , [ r4 ] @xmath51 is the closed string coupling , and @xmath52 is the string tension .    the probe d5 wraps @xmath53 and @xmath45 ( breaking all supersymmetries ) .",
    "thus , the only spatial direction common to all branes is @xmath54 , and the directions in which all branes have definite positions are @xmath38 and @xmath15 .",
    "the complex position = e^i = x^8 + i x^9 [ op ] of the d5 relative to the d3s plays the role of a superconducting order parameter .",

    "this means that , in the description of the sc state , one can not replace the 3/5 strings with their ground states ; the entire ladder of excited string states remains . in a superconductor , that can be interpreted as quasiparticles acquiring an internal structure .",
    "while there is nothing wrong with this in principle , in practice one faces the problem of how to define , let alone use , this theory .",
    "on the other hand , on the gravity side , the low - energy modes are described by the action of the d5 embedded in the full d3 geometry ( [ ds2 ] ) , and the high - energy ( stringy ) modes are described by strings connecting the branes . as a result",
    ", many properties of the superconductor can be computed on the gravity side even without a complete definition of the dual quantum theory . in this paper , we consider several of these properties .",

    "[ rhod ] we are looking at this in the limit @xmath153 , with the boundary condition @xmath154 . the substitution ( ) = g(z ) , [ g ] where z = ( _ 0 / ) , [ z ] brings ( [ rhod ] ) to the form g g - ( g)^2 - g g  + g g  = - .",

    ". the threshold may be lower for production of a bound state . ]",
    "what we learn here , then , is not that the gapped state is always stable , but rather that the quasiparticles that are produced by its decay can not be described by a uniform solution .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the observation that none of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fren ] is convex .",
    "that means that , in a long wire , a uniform state with @xmath164 is unstable with respect to phase separation  fragmentation into regions with different winding number densities .- dependent .",
    "] unlike the instability of the gapped state , this one does not rely on phase slips : it occurs even at fixed total winding , equal to that of the initial uniform state .",
    "the form of the free - energy curves ( with the absolute minimum reached at @xmath165 ) suggests that , upon phase separation , there will be regions with @xmath166 , which are almost quasiparticle - free , while quasiparticles are concentrated in droplets dispersed among these regions  an `` emulsion . ''",
    "we find plausible the following hypothesis about the nature of the quasiparticle - rich droplets : they are `` baryons , '' each made of @xmath24 d3/d5 strings . recall that these strings carry color with respect to the @xmath167 gauge group that lives on the d3s worldvolume .",
    "the baryon is colorless .",
    "strings connect the d5 to the d3s , rather than to the boundary of an ads space . ]",
    "the complete antisymmetry of its wavefunction with respect to color means that there is a quasiparticle in each of the @xmath24 conductance channels of the wire .",
    "in the present work , we have aimed to understand the nature of the mixed sc - normal state that forms in a strongly coupled thin superconductor at currents above a certain @xmath168 but well below the depairing current @xmath169 .",
    "this has been done here in the context of the same d3/d5 system as we used in @xcite .",
    "the momentum carried by the supercurrent is represented by the flux of the worldvolume gauge field induced on the d5 , as the latter winds around the d3s , and the momentum of the normal component by the flux due to charges behind the horizon .",
    "natural first guesses for the mixed state are uniform solutions , in which both these fluxes are uniform in @xmath12 ( the coordinate along the wire ) and , in the leading large @xmath24 limit , entirely classical . we have argued that such solutions exist but are unstable against fragmentation , leading eventually , we believe , to a non - uniform ground state  an `` emulsion '' of quasiparticle - rich droplets in a nearly quasiparticle - free matrix .",
    "the non - uniform mixed state hypothesized here is similar to the mixed state of type ii superconductors , with the droplets seen as `` electric '' analogs of the magnetic flux lines , and the winding density @xmath34 , at which production of quasiparticles becomes energetically favorable , as the counterpart of the lower critical field @xmath170 .",
    "this analogy leads us to speculate further on the properties of such a state , in particular , on the role of disorder .",
    "all quasiparticles produced by phase slips carry the same momentum ( either @xmath72 or @xmath171 ) .",
    "one may wonder , then , if in the presence of disorder , when momentum is no longer conserved , the quasiparticles will not simply disappear , and the wire will not revert to the purely sc state .",
    "the analogy with a type ii superconductor makes us think that this is unlikely . in that case",
    ", the presence of flux lines in the sample is not a result of any conservation law ( they can enter and leave the sample through the boundary ) but a consequence of the energetics : the difference @xmath172 ( in our case , @xmath173 ) plays the role of a chemical potential for a flux line ( in our case , a quasiparticle ) .    guided by the same analogy",
    ", one may contemplate a periodic array of droplets  an analog of the abrikosov flux lattice .",
    "one may wonder if there are classical solutions of dual gravity capable of describing such an array .",
