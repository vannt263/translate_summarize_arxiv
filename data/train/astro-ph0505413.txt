    "the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays , extending over more than 12 decades in energy , follows , over a large range , a simple power law @xmath0 @xmath1 indicating its non - thermal character .",
    "however , in the region between 1  pev and 10  pev a change of the spectral index from @xmath2 to @xmath3 occurs , the so - called _ knee _ in the spectrum of cosmic rays . since its discovery @xcite nearly 50 years ago",
    "many measurements have been performed in this energy range ( see e.g. @xcite for recent measurement results ) , but the origin of the knee feature is still not convincingly explained .",
    "proposals for its origin range from astrophysical scenarios like the change of acceleration mechanisms @xcite at the sources of cosmic rays ( supernova remnants , pulsars , etc . ) or effects due to the propagation @xcite inside the galaxy ( diffusion , drift , escape from the galaxy ) to particle physics models like the interaction with relic neutrinos @xcite during transport or new processes in the atmosphere @xcite during air shower development .",
    "common to all models is the prediction of a change of composition over the knee region .",
    "moreover , in order to distinguish between individual models , knowledge of the energy spectra of individual elements or at least mass groups of primary cosmic rays is desired since the different models predict different spectral shapes .",
    "because of the low fluxes of cosmic rays only indirect measurements via the detection of extensive air showers ( eas ) induced by primary cosmic ray particles in the atmosphere are feasible at present in the energy range close to and above 1  pev .",
    "determination of spectra for individual elements or mass groups is limited by the large intrinsic fluctuations of eas observables .",
    "furthermore , any analysis of air shower data has to rely on eas simulations and our limited knowledge of particle physics in the energy range of relevance .",
    "since the primary energies of the showers are beyond the energy range of man - made accelerators and reactions relevant to shower development occur in the very forward direction not accessible in collider experiments , uncertainties in the description of hadronic interactions in shower development are unavoidable .",
    "one has , therefore , to rely on the use of phenomenological interaction models which differ in their predictions in some respect strongly , making the task of retrieving information about individual energy spectra from air shower data even more difficult .",
    "approaches facing these difficulties by using statistical methods and extensive comparisons with simulations can be found e.g. in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the classical eas observables , electron and muon numbers , which deals with these problems . because of the high accuracy of the kascade experiment the presented method , based on unfolding procedures , is capable of reconstructing energy spectra for five elements representing different mass groups of primary cosmic ray particles .",
    "the analysis is performed twice using simulations with two different high energy hadronic interaction models , qgsjet @xcite and sibyll @xcite .",
    "this approach gives also a lower limit of the uncertainties due to the modelling of hadronic interactions .",

    "mathematical details of this procedure are given in appendix [ mathe ] . in this equation all relevant eas and reconstruction properties are contained in the so - called response matrix .",

    "the kascade ( karlsruhe shower core and array detector ) experiment @xcite investigates air showers in a primary energy range from 100  tev to 100  pev and measures a large number of observables for each event : electrons , muons at four energy thresholds , and energy and number of hadrons .",

    ".      for unfolding techniques to be applicable the matrix equation ( [ simplemateq ] ) has to exhibit a minimum degree of stability for the algorithms to provide meaningful solutions .",
    "this stability is characterized by the condition number of the response matrix , which is strongly influenced by the number of primary particle types included in the analysis .",
    "one is restricted to a maximum number of elements since otherwise this would lead to a singular matrix .",

    "in addition , a significant increase in the statistical uncertainty of the solution with the transition from four to five primaries was observed .",
    "due to the already large condition number in the case of five elements and only small improvement in the description of the data by the solution , finally five primary particle types are adopted for the analysis .",

    "the good description of the low energy data range by the sibyll based simulations is also the reason for the smaller systematic uncertainties in fig .",
    "[ sib_unfoldbands ] at lower energies when compared to the qgsjet results .",

    "in contrast , the description in the higher @xmath41 range is much worse than before .",

    "[ sibeledistmycut ] .",
    "in particular the left - hand tail of the @xmath40-distribution can not be described using the five assumed particle types . in order to fit the distribution as well as possible",

    "[ sib_unfoldbands ] .",
    "whereas the data description at lower energies works quite well , at higher energies showers generated with the sibyll model seem to be too electron rich or too muon poor compared to the data .",
    "the same conclusion holds when investigating the @xmath41-distribution for different @xmath40 bins .",
    "despite the fact that none of the two hadronic interaction models is able to describe the whole data range consistently , it is possible to get hints , why their predictions do not match the data and how agreement with the data could be improved . in fig .",

    "<S> a composition analysis of kascade air shower data is performed by means of unfolding the two - dimensional frequency spectrum of electron and muon numbers . </S>",
    "<S> aim of the analysis is the determination of energy spectra for elemental groups representing the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> since such an analysis depends crucially on simulations of air showers the two different hadronic interaction models qgsjet and sibyll are used for their generation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting primary energy spectra show that the knee in the all particle spectrum is due to a steepening of the spectra of light elements but , also , that neither of the two simulation sets is able to describe the measured data consistently over the whole energy range with discrepancies appearing in different energy regions </S>",
