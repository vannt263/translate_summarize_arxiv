    "high resolution 2d hydrodynamical simulations with the zeus - mp2 code showed that ordered rotation in the stellar component affects significantly the evolution of the hot ism in etgs , and , among other effects , results in the formation of a centrifugally supported cold equatorial disc ( negri et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter n14 ) .",
    "this disc can be extended ( @xmath0 kpc radius ) , and as massive as @xmath1m@xmath2 in the biggest etgs .",
    "indeed there is evidence that @xmath3% of massive etgs host significant quantities of cold gas ( davis et al .",
    "2011 , serra et al .",
    "2014 ) , often in settled configurations , sharing the same kinematics of the stars , consistent with an internal origin . also , the cold gas seems to provide material for low level star formation ( hereafter sf ) ; and , in the atlas@xmath4 sample , molecular gas , sf and young stellar populations are detected only in fast rotators ( sarzi et al .",
    "2013 , davis et al . 2014 ) .",
    "we then added the possibility for the gas to form stars to the simulations of n14 , to explore whether sf can bring the amount of cold gas in the models more in agreement with observed values , and whether it can explain the low - level sf activity currently seen to be ongoing in rotating systems .",
    "[ without sf ( left panel ) , and with the two adopted @xmath5 values ( other panels ) ] ; the stellar mass in newly formed stars @xmath6 ; the sf rate normalized to the initial stellar mass of the galaxy @xmath7 ; the mean formation time of the new stars @xmath8 , calculated from an initial time of 2 gyr .",

    "hydrodynamical simulations were run for a representative subset of 12 rotating models from n14 , including in the code the removal of cold gas , and the injection of mass , momentum and energy appropriate for the newly forming stellar population ( negri et al .",
    "sf was implemented by subtracting gas from the grid , at an adopted rate per unit volume of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the gas density , @xmath5 is the sf efficiency ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 were adopted ) , and @xmath13 is the maximum between the cooling timescale and the dynamical timescale . in a typical ( cyclical ) evolution ,",
    "gas injected by the stellar population accumulates until radiative losses become catastrophic , significant amounts of cold material are produced , and sf is enhanced . at the end the cold gas mass @xmath14 is much reduced in the models with sf , and the mass in new stars @xmath15 is close to the @xmath14 values of the models without sf ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the new stars reside mostly in a disc , and could be related to a younger , more metal rich disky stellar component observed in fast rotators ( cappellari et al .",
    "most of @xmath15 formed a few gyrs ago ; the sf rate at the present epoch is low ( @xmath16m@xmath2yr@xmath17 ) , as observed , at least for model etgs of stellar mass @xmath18m@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "the adopted sf recipe reproduces the slope of the kennicutt - schmidt relation , and even its normalization for @xmath11 ( negri et al ."
