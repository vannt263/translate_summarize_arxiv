    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , discovered in the late 1960 s @xcite , are the most powerful explosions in the universe ever since the big bang ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "for about three decades , their exact nature remained elusive .",
    "it is only in 1997 , due to the efforts to provide a fast re - pointing of the bepposax satellite that observational clues helped to fix their nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "long grbs are now thought to be the signature of transient jets from rapidly accreting stellar mass black holes born after the collapse of a massive star in a hypernova @xcite .    since the mid-90",
    ", the fireball model @xcite has emerged to explain the grb phenomenon .",
    "this model is based on the ejection of a relativistic fireball / jet during black hole formation , it explains the observed emission by energy dissipation within the fireball ( or jet ) and when the fireball interacts with the surrounding medium .",
    "observationally , the grb phenomenon can be divided into various phases .",
    "the emission starts with the prompt grb lasting few to several seconds , which is usually detected at high energies .",
    "it is followed by the afterglow , which can be observed at all wavelengths .",
    "a consensus exists to attribute the prompt grb to the internal emission from the jet at distances @xmath0 km from the source , and the afterglow to the forward shock emission at distances @xmath1 km from the source ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "one difficulty faced by observers for the interpretation of grb observations is that the prompt and afterglow emissions are often superimposed in time .",
    "while the emission regions of the prompt and of the afterglow are well separated spatially , the relativistic jet travels at the speed of light , and the photons from internal shocks leave the forward region more or less at the same time as the photons from the forward shock .    the main instruments to observe the afterglow quickly are robotic telescopes , that can start observations within seconds of an alert , and the xrt and uvot onboard swift @xcite .",
    "this race toward fast re - pointing has allowed various observations of the prompt optical emission by small autonomous telescopes for several grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two general trends have been seen : either a bright optical emission , uncorrelated to the gamma - ray light curve ( for 5 to 20% of grbs according to the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a faint optical emission correlated with the gamma - ray emission ( e.g. , vestrand et al .",
    "2006 ; or , klotz et al .",
    "2009b ) .",
    "in this work , we present a successful observing campaign of   ( t@xmath2 = 02:02:41 ut , * ? ? ?",

    "the long duration of the gamma ",
    "ray emission ( t@xmath3 = @xmath4 s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favored early optical observations during the prompt phase .",
    "moreover , the high declination ( + 67 degrees ) means that the field of the grb is circumpolar for northern observatories . as a consequence ,",

    "thus , we can not conclude from the closure relations alone the type of medium surrounding the burst .    in an ism case , the cooling frequency decreases as @xmath120 and would have crossed the x - ray band ( assuming the value derived in sec .",

    "conversely , in a wind case , the cooling frequency would start crossing the x - ray band @xmath121 seconds after the trigger ( assuming no jet effect ) , not observable by the xrt .",
    "it is thus impossible to conclude on the surrounding medium .",
    "it is however known that usually an ism medium fit the data better ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the following , we will use this hypothesis .",
    "the previous considerations set general constraints on the fireball ( energy , lorentz factor , jet opening angle ) , and we can now try to model the afterglow observations . in the standard afterglow model , only two mechanisms can explain the strong optical re - brightening observed between temporal bins 6 and 8 : the start of the afterglow or the reverse shock .    assuming the re - brightening to be the start of the afterglow , like in @xcite , the maximum of the emission is emitted at the deceleration radius .",
    "in such a case the initial lorentz factor of the fireball , @xmath122 has to be low ( of the order of 100 ) to have a deceleration time in agreement with the peak time .",
    "however , the optical decay index of the optical emission after the peak of the afterglow is either 0.25 or @xmath123 ( @xmath124 for p=2.2 ) @xcite .",
    "this is not in agreement with the data .",
    "the second solution explains the optical re - brightening with the reverse shock .",
    "this is better supported from the data , as the sed during the temporal bin 7 implies the presence of an additional component in optical ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec_analysis_sed ] ) .",
    "according to @xcite , in the thin shell configuration and slow cooling , the light - curve of the reverse shock has a characteristic evolution , rising like t@xmath125 , and decaying like t@xmath126 ( for p=2.2 ) when the observed frequency falls between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is precisely the evolution of the optical light - curve in the interval 300 - 5000 sec , strengthening the reverse shock interpretation .",
    "this interpretation also provides a natural explanation of the small ( flatter ) transition phase near the bin 8 , due to the transition between the reverse and the forward shocks .",
    "we can now use the observed value @xmath127 s in the source frame to estimate the parameters of the jet . if we consider a surrounding medium of constant density n = 0.1 @xmath128 , and an energy release e@xmath129 erg ( considering = @xmath130 erg and assuming 30% radiating efficiency ) , we get @xmath131 , again suggesting a rather low lorentz factor .",
    "the situation in the x - ray band during the re - brightening is also complex .",
    "we do not expect the reverse shock to be visible in x - rays .",
    "however , two features can not be explained straightforwardly by the forward or the reverse shocks .",
    "first , the large spectral variations between the temporal bin 6 to 9 , and second a bright x - ray flare peaking at about 600 seconds . for the former discrepancy",
    ", we may observe the transition between central engine activity and the classical afterglow .",
    "for the latter , we note that other grbs with a strong delayed optical re - brightening display nearly simultaneous x - ray flares , this is the case of grb  060418 and grb  060607a @xcite , and more recently grb  100219a@xcite . within the framework of the fireball model , x - ray flares superimposed on the afterglow",
    "are interpreted as late activity of the central engine .",
    "late central engine activity could also explain the slope of the x - ray spectrum immediately after the flare , @xmath132 during bin 7 , which is equal to the slope measured during the prompt phase ( table [ table_fit_x ] ) .",
    "finally the duration of the x - ray flare t@xmath43250 seconds is comparable with the duration 9  of the prompt phase , also suggesting that delayed activity of the central engine is continuing at that time , and dominates the x - ray light - curve .",
    "one issue with this assumption is that it provides no explanation for the similarity of the temporal decay in x - rays and visible shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_alpha ] .",
    "we can then complete our model description .",
    "we assume that the emission in bin 9 is completely dominated by the forward shock , that the visible emission in bin 7 is dominated by the reverse shock , and that the x - ray emission in bin 7 is dominated by the prompt . in order to reproduce the observations",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the swift burst was a very bright burst visible in the northern hemisphere .  was intrinsically long and very energetic and it occurred in a low - density interstellar medium environment , leading to delayed afterglow emission and a clear temporal separation of the main emitting components : prompt emission , reverse shock , and forward shock . </S>",
    "<S> our observations show several remarkable features of grb 110205a : the detection of prompt optical emission strongly correlated with the bat light curve , with no temporal lag between the two ; the absence of correlation of the x - ray emission compared to the optical and high energy gamma - ray ones during the prompt phase ; and a large optical re - brightening after the end of the prompt phase , that we interpret as a signature of the reverse shock . beyond the pedagogical value offered by the excellent multi - wavelength coverage of a grb with temporally separated radiating components , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several questions raised by our observations : the nature of the prompt optical emission and the spectral evolution of the prompt emission at high - energies ( from 0.5 kev to 150 kev ) ; the origin of an x - ray flare at the beginning of the forward shock ; and the modeling of the afterglow , including the reverse shock , in the framework of the classical fireball model . </S>"
