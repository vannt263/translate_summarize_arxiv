    "the modern perspective of effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite provides a framework for constructing theories based on observed hadronic degrees of freedom that can faithfully reproduce low - energy qcd .",
    "an example of a successful eft is chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite , which systematically describes low - energy hadronic processes in the vacuum .",
    "the success of effective chiral lagrangians in the vacuum has motivated the application of eft concepts to models of nuclear properties .",
    "a chiral effective lagrangian for nuclei was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has lead to new insights into the successes of quantum hadrodynamic ( qhd ) models@xcite of nuclei . in that work ,",
    "a general model in which nucleons interact via mesonic degrees of freedom was constructed and applied to nuclei at the one - baryon - loop level ( hartree approximation ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian and energy functional were organized according to georgi s naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite , which provides a controlled mean - field expansion in terms of powers and derivatives of the mean fields _ if _ the dimensionless coefficients identified in the nda are of order one .",
    "the latter property is called `` naturalness '' in this context .",
    "detailed fits to nuclear observables validated this expansion and truncation scheme @xcite .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since the nda counting is based on absorbing short - distance physics into the coefficients of the effective lagrangian , but a mean - field functional fit to nuclear data must also absorb long - distance many - body effects .    a useful interpretation of the finite - density mean - field effective theory is in terms of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in a dft formulation of the relativistic many - body problem ,",
    "one works with an energy functional of scalar densities and vector four - currents .",
    "minimization of the functional gives rise to variational equations that determine the ground - state densities . by introducing a complete set of dirac wave functions",
    ", one can recast these variational equations as dirac equations for occupied orbitals ; the single - particle hamiltonian contains _ local _ scalar and vector potentials , not only in the hartree approximation , but in the general case as well .",
    "the hartree approximation only limits the form of the potentials .",
    "thus the effects of many - body physics such as short - range correlations are incorporated ( approximately ) by a direct fit to nuclear observables .    in mean - field meson models ,",
    "the scalar and vector meson fields play the role of auxiliary kohn - sham potentials .",
    "alternatively , one can expand the local potentials directly in terms of nucleon densities .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian replaces meson exchange with point - coupling ( contact ) interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a relativistic point - coupling lagrangian was introduced and applied to nuclei at the mean - field level .",
    "subsequently , friar et al .",
    "@xcite examined this model for naturalness and concluded that the parameters were , in fact , mostly natural . here",
    ", the analysis of point - coupling models in the context of eft s is reexamined and broadened in a manner consistent with the analysis of the chiral mean - field meson model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we find that the assumption of naturalness is justified and that the density expansion implied by nda is applicable . in principle",

    "however , the point - coupling parameters are underdetermined by the fits , which limits the usefulness of the comparisons .",
    "new optimization procedures described below suggest that a different organization that exploits cancellations characteristic of relativistic models may be more productive .",
    "at present we can not derive an effective point - coupling lagrangian directly from qcd . in the same spirit as chpt and the effective meson model of ref .",
    "@xcite , a general point - coupling effective lagrangian is therefore constructed consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd ( e.g. , lorentz covariance , gauge invariance , and chiral symmetry ) . in this work ,",
    "we construct a one - loop energy - functional from the lagrangian and determine the couplings by fits to nuclear observables . as noted above and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach approximates a density functional that , if sufficiently general , incorporates many - body effects beyond the hartree approximation .",
    "we expect this approximation to be reasonable because of the large scalar and vector potentials ( `` hartree dominance '' ) @xcite",
    ".    this framework will only be useful if we can identify a valid expansion and truncation scheme .",
    "this requires an organization of terms in the effective lagrangian and a way to estimate the couplings . while precise relations between these couplings and the underlying qcd parameters are unknown , an estimate of the magnitude of the couplings can be obtained by applying georgi s naive dimensional analysis ( nda)@xcite .",
    "the procedure is to extract from each term in the lagrangian the dependence on two primary physical scales of the effective theory , the pion decay constant , @xmath0mev and a larger mass scale , @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the number of light flavors ) @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath3 is associated with the mass scale of physics beyond the goldstone bosons ( pions ) : the non - goldstone boson masses or the nucleon mass .",
    "this mass scale ranges from the scalar mass  @xmath4mev to the baryon mass @xmath5gev .",
    "when a specific value is needed in this work , @xmath3 will be taken to equal the @xmath6-meson mass ( @xmath7mev ) , roughly in the center of this range . to establish the canonical normalization of the strongly interacting fields , an inverse factor of @xmath8 is included for each field and an overall factor of @xmath9 fixes the normalization of the lagrangian .",
    "the physics of nda is discussed further in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we construct the point - coupling effective lagrangian as an expansion in powers of the nucleon scalar , vector , isovector - vector , tensor , and isovector - tensor densities scaled according to nda : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the nucleon field .",
    "the lagrangian is also organized according to an expansion in derivatives acting on these densities ; nda dictates that each derivative is scaled by @xmath3 : @xmath12 except for the kinetic term , derivatives acting on an individual nucleon field , rather than on a density , are eliminated by field redefinitions as in ref .",
    "@xcite in favor of terms of the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eqone])([eq : eqfive ] ) .",
    "this is because time derivatives on the nearly on - shell valence nucleons are of @xmath13 and are therefore not suppressed according to ( [ eq : eqsix ] ) . as discussed in ref .",

    "we can transform away mixed - derivative terms such as @xmath16 in favor of tensor terms , which are then neglected ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "naive dimensional analysis provides an organizational principle that directly translates into numerical estimates at the mean - field level .",
    "for example , each additional power of @xmath17 is accompanied by a factor of @xmath18",
    ". the ratios of scalar and vector densities to this factor at nuclear matter equilibrium density are between 1/4 and 1/7 @xcite , which serves as an expansion parameter .",
    "similarly , one can anticipate good convergence for gradients of the densities , since the relevant scale for derivatives in finite nuclei should be roughly the nuclear surface thickness @xmath19 , and so the dimensionless expansion parameter is @xmath20 .",
    "this expansion is only useful , however , if the coefficients are not too large",
    ".    in effective lagrangians of qcd applied to scattering problems , fits to experimental data suggest that when nda is applied the remaining dimensionless coefficients are of order unity .",
    "this is known as `` naturalness '' ; it is an essential feature if nda is to be useful as an organizational scheme .",
    "the premise of naturalness in point - coupling models is to be tested here for _ finite - density _ applications through fits to experimental nuclear data .",
    "naive dimensional analysis applied to the point - coupling model of nikolaus et  al .",
    "@xcite and to the meson model of ref .",
    "@xcite already suggest that effective nuclear models are natural , which in turn implies a convergent mean - field expansion in density based on an organization prescribed by nda @xcite .",
    "this is a nontrivial result , because the naturalness assumption implies that all the short - distance physics ( with scale @xmath21 ) is incorporated into the coefficients of the effective lagrangian , while long - distance finite - density effects should be calculated explicitly in a systematic application of the effective lagrangian . at the mean - field level , however , we also approximately absorb long - distance many - body effects from ladder and ring diagrams @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian should in principle contain every possible term ( allowed by symmetries ) to a given order under this organization .",
    "however , certain classes of terms will be poorly determined by fits to bulk nuclear observables . here",

    "@xcite is proportional to the scalar density , @xmath23 ; terms second order in the scalar density here ( including those containing derivatives ) are therefore related to the mass and kinetic terms of the scalar meson field as well as its yukawa coupling to the nucleon in the meson model .",
    "the term cubic in the scalar density in the point - coupling model has a correspondence with the term cubic in the scalar field , and so on .",

    "the new feature here that allows for this deviation from conventional wisdom is the isoscalar vector - tensor coupling proportional to @xmath124 , the analog of which has not usually been included in relativistic mean - field models in the meson model plays a role in determining electromagnetic properties through vmd effects , whereas @xmath124 in the point - coupling model does not have any direct association with such effects . ]",
    "( often based on arguments from vector dominance and the smallness of the isoscalar anomalous moment of the nucleon ) .",
    "it provides , however , an independent contribution to the spin - orbit force . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the analog of this term ( proportional to @xmath125 ) was included , the optimization did not lead to particularly large values of the tensor coupling @xmath125 , although for set g2 it was large enough to drive the value of @xmath123 to 0.66 .",
    "this value is outside the range @xmath126 for conventional models with good fits to nuclei @xcite . in the point - coupling model",
    "there is apparently a significant advantage to having larger @xmath124 ( at least with our choice of observables and weights ) and we find @xmath123 as large as 0.74 !",
    "since we are primarily concerned here with testing naturalness and the nda expansion and not with generating parameter sets for practical use , we have simply checked that setting @xmath127 and re - optimizing the parameters yields a smaller value for @xmath128 ( consistent with conventional wisdom of nuclear models ) and does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "this is indeed the case .",

    "the larger compressibilities of the point - coupling models is evident and leads to deviations from the meson - model result . with increasing density ,",
    "the energies for point - coupling models va4 and fz4 ( and all others fit here ) increase smoothly , as found for meson models ( such as g1 ) .",
    "in contrast , the point - coupling model found by nikolaus et al .  @xcite shows a peculiar second minimum .",
    "this structure comes from the contributions from the highest - order terms ( fourth power of density ) in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are much larger than those of the next - to - leading order .",
    "their contributions to the value of @xmath131 and to the binding energy become dominant for values of the fermi momentum not far from saturation , indicating that the expansion has broken down ; for this restricted class of models the extrapolation in density is not valid .",
    "the corresponding parameters are individually unnatural and there are no mixed terms , so the @xmath132 equation is strongly affected .",

    "( the reader is cautioned not to confuse @xmath136 with the label of the parameter sets associated with the optimal hierarchy ) .",
    "the scale of the natural size of contributions expected from an @xmath136-th order term is obtained through nda ; since the difference in the scalar and vector densities is small , ( the magnitude of ) the contribution from such a term can be estimated by @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a ( positive ) number of order unity and @xmath139 is the nuclear matter equilibrium density .",
    "estimates for @xmath140mev are marked in the figures with crosses and the error bars reflect a range of @xmath138 from @xmath141 to 2 .",
    "we observe that the estimates are quite consistent with the energies found from the fits .",
    "since the contributions decrease steadily with increasing powers of the densities , the expansion and truncation scheme proposed under nda is justified .",
    "note that this decrease will become more gradual as the density is increased above equilibrium density .",
    "based on the estimates , a truncation at @xmath142 for ordinary nuclear observables yields an error of order 1  mev or less .",
    "the contributions at fourth - order in the density are on the order of the nuclear - matter binding energy , however , and consistency implies we need to include these terms . in practice , however , the @xmath143 truncation ( parameter set p2 ) is able to absorb the @xmath142 contributions .",
    "this result is consistent with a recent analysis of the nonrelativistic skyrme energy functional @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this was not the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath143 fit , while quite reasonable , was also noticeably inferior to @xmath142 .",
    "while the expansion and truncation scheme is supported by our results , a comparison of the various parameter sets shows significant variation for individual parameters . in many cases",
    "even the sign is indeterminate .",
    "thus the parameters in this approach , as in the relativistic meson model , are underdetermined .",
    "on the other hand , table  [ tab : optvalues ] shows that the optimal parameters are much better constrained by the data .",
    "therefore reformulating the effective theory in terms of an optimal basis may be more productive .",
    "no restrictions were imposed during optimization on the signs of the coefficients @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 nor on @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 when they were allowed to vary ( the `` v '' sets ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in tables  [ tab : coeffsfz][tab : coeffsva ] , a direct transformation from a relativistic mean - field meson model would predict definite signs for these coefficients ; the coefficients determined through this transformation would depend only on the squares of the yukawa couplings , @xmath150 , as well as the squares of the meson masses , @xmath151 .",
    "sets fa@xmath136 and fz@xmath136 all have positive values for the corresponding values of @xmath150 as well as for the scalar mass squared .",
    "( recall that the corresponding values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 were held fixed for these sets ) .",
    "parameters sets vz@xmath136 and va@xmath136 , however , include sets with @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the ratio @xmath156 , which is the integrated strength in each channel , is reasonably well determined and is in every case positive .",
    "the difficulty with predicting individual masses and couplings is revealed by table  [ tab : optvalues ] . while @xmath157 is well determined and consistent across the parameter sets ,",
    "@xmath158 is poorly determined .",
    "thus , the individual values for @xmath159 and @xmath54 are also poorly determined , and we can not reliably extract masses and couplings from the fits . we conclude that the nuclear observables we have used do not provide sufficient constraints to definitively test whether the point couplings are dominated by an underlying meson phenomenology .",
    "the combinations that _ are _ well determined correspond to the strength and range of the effective central potential .",
    "specifically , if the static nonrelativistic potential in momentum space from the exchange of scalar and vector mesons is written as : @xmath160 and expanded in powers of @xmath161 , @xmath162 the two combinations of couplings and masses in parentheses are reasonably well determined .",
    "the successful application of eft concepts to mean - field mesonic models of nuclei @xcite motivates their application to point - coupling models .",
    "such models describe nuclear interactions through contact terms ( in a derivative expansion ) in place of meson exchange . in comparison to the large body of work on meson models ,",
    "the analysis of relativistic point - coupling models has been quite limited . here , we extend the model of nikolaus , hoch , and madland @xcite and its analysis by friar et al .",
    "@xcite to encompass a more complete analysis based on eft concepts .",
    "the lagrangian is consistent with the symmetries of qcd and is organized according to the same principle of naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) applied to the relativistic meson model of ref .",
    "the organization is an expansion in powers and derivatives of the densities in ratio to scales dictated by nda results : a given term in the lagrangian takes the form @xmath163\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is a dimensionless coefficient and @xmath165 and @xmath166 are integers .",
    "( electromagnetic interactions will also contain a power of the photon field and the electric charge ) . in principle , all terms consistent with the symmetries should be included to a given order in the expansion , but in the present work we have omitted a variety of terms that we expect to be poorly determined based on meson exchange phenomenology and experience with relativistic meson mean - field models .",
    "the nda organization provides a valid expansion scheme provided the coefficients are `` natural '' ( on the order of unity ) ; one can construct an energy functional in powers of densities and their derivatives and truncate at some finite order with a controlled error .",
    "our fits to bulk nuclear properties show this to be the case . beyond a second - order truncation ,",
    "the models resulting from these fits reproduce the experimental data quite well .",
    "we conclude that nda and the naturalness assumption are compatible with and implied by the observed properties of finite nuclei , even though many - body effects are absorbed into the coefficients .",
    "point - coupling models therefore provide an alternative phenomenology to mean - field meson models . in principle",
    ", a direct transformation exists between any point - coupling and meson mean - field model .",
    "the equations of motion for the mean meson fields can be iterated to solve the fields as an expansion in scalar and vector densities .",
    "the delicate cancellations at low order in the expansion result in too large a truncation error for such transformations to be of use , however , and _ any point - coupling model derived from a mesonic model in this way must be refit to the data_. we note that naturalness of the point - coupling model was found in the absence of counting factors that were required in the meson model analysis .",
    "although fourth - order terms would be required for a consistent truncation , a truncation at third order in the point - coupling model can yield a good fit to data , in contrast to the meson models where fourth - order terms were necessary in obtaining a good fit . due to improvements in the optimization procedure over",
    "that used in ref .",
    "@xcite through a reorganization of the lagrangian in terms of `` optimal parameters '' , a true comparison can not be made until the fits obtained in that reference are reanalyzed .",
    "the analysis in terms of optimal parameters suggests that they may provide a more efficient basis for an expansion .",
    "while the individual coefficients in the covariant point - coupling model are in general poorly determined by the nuclear data , the lower - order optimal parameters are quite well constrained and only the highest - order parameters are badly underdetermined .",
    "the use of optimal parameters was suggested by methods of the heavy baryon formulation of chiral perturbation theory , adapted to finite density .",
    "further development of this approach and its relation to nonrelativistic energy functionals for nuclei is in progress .",
