    "the origin of gravity and the laws of newton is a long standing issue . even after the discovery of general relativity by einstein ,",
    "the answer about the origin of universal gravity is still far from satisfying because of two reasons : ( i ) there is still serious problem in the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity ; ( ii ) it is still not clear how to establish a unified theory of electromagnetic , weak , strong and gravitational forces . in a recent work ,",
    "verlinde @xcite emphasized again the end of gravity as a fundamental force , which has already been suggested by jacobson @xcite almost fifteen years ago .",
    "a related idea was also proposed by padmanabhan @xcite .",
    "verlinde s work has ignited intensive studies on the thermodynamical origin of gravity .",
    "these advances were motivated by the fact that the gravity law closely resembles the laws of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics bekenstein , bardeen , hawking , davies , unruh .",
    "following verlinde s work @xcite , we reconsider the assumption of the change of entropy @xmath0 for an object having a displacement @xmath1 and the unruh effect which assuming a temperature for an accelerated object .",
    "this assumption and unruh effect play an essential role in verlinde s derivations on the universal gravity and the laws of newton . in the present work ,",
    "simple derivations are given for this assumption and unruh effect with the standard theory about quantum mechanics , special relativity and vacuum  background based on the gauge field theory .",
    "our derivations establish further the logic basis of regarding the gravity as an entropic force .",
    "we also stress the local thermal equilibrium @xcite in deriving the universal gravity .",
    "in addition to the dimensional consideration to get the planck length , we try to argue that the planck length is the coherence length of the fluctuating vacuum  background in thermal equilibrium . as for the equivalence principle ,",
    "the derivation of the newton s law of gravity shows clearly that the gravitational mass is the same physical concept as the inertial mass .",
    "therefore , general relativity is the natural generalization of the special relativity with the inclusion of gravity , where the weak equivalence principle is not an assumption any more .",
    "in the original work by verlinde @xcite , the following postulation motivated by bekenstein s work @xcite about black holes and entropy , plays a key role in deriving the newton s law of gravity@xmath2 in the above formula , @xmath0 is the change of entropy after a displacement @xmath3 for a particle with mass @xmath4 .",
    "here we reconsider the physical mechanism of this postulation based on quantum mechanics , special relativity and vacuum  background .    from the special relativity , we have@xmath5from the quantum mechanics , the eigenfrequency is then@xmath6if the space is regarded as a sort of fluctuating vacuum  background due to the existence of various gauge fields",
    ", there is a strong coupling between the matter and the vacuum  background . as a consequence , from the view of the vacuum  background",
    ", we have the following coherence length for the particle:@xmath7the factor @xmath8 in the above equation is due to the fact that the gauge field in the vacuum  has just the propagation velocity of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 , we have@xmath10when the coupling between the particle and the vacuum  background is considered , the coherence length @xmath11 gives the location resolution of the particle from the view of the vacuum  background .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we show the motion of a particle along the dashed line .",
    "because of the location resolution from the view of the vacuum  background , the dashed line is partitioned by the box with side length @xmath12 . at time @xmath13 , the wavepacket of the particle is shown by the dashed line . at a later time",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , the wavepacket of the particle is shown by the solid line . at time @xmath14 , the information of the location of the particle at time @xmath16 recorded by the vacuumbackground will be lost because of two reasons : ( 1 ) at time @xmath14 , although the location of the particle with spatial resolution @xmath12 is recorded by the vacuum  background , the velocity information is highly uncertain . from @xmath17 ,",
    "the velocity uncertainty of the particle is @xmath18 . in this situation , at time @xmath14 , after the position of the particle is recorded by the vacuum  background , the history of the particle is lost from the view of the vacuum  background .",
    "( 2 ) at time @xmath13 , although the location with spatial resolution @xmath12 is recorded by the vacuum  background , it will be lost rapidly after a displacement at time @xmath14 . at time @xmath13 , the location record is due to the coupling between the particle and the vacuum  background . because the vacuum  background is highly fluctuating , at time @xmath14 , the location information at time @xmath13 will be lost because of the re - establishment of the thermal equilibrium in the vacuum  background .    ) .",
    "( c ) shows the essential difference between @xmath12 and @xmath19 . ]",
    "the above analysis shows that there is an entropy increase of @xmath20 after the displacement of @xmath12 . from this result , it is straightforward to get@xmath21with @xmath3 being the overall length of the particle trajectory , irrelevant to the trajectory shape . by setting @xmath22 , we get eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , for a trajectory with length @xmath23 , the bits of information @xmath24 .",
    "however , from the view of vacuum  background , all these information are lost at the final location of this trajectory .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath3 is due to the fact that the overall information in units of bit is proportional to the overall length of a trajectory .    to justify further the above derivation",
    ", we give here several discussions .",
    "\\(1 ) in the above derivation , we assume a strong coupling between the particle and the vacuum  background , so that the location of the particle can be recorded by the vacuum  background . as shown in sec .",
    "iv , the temperature of the vacuum  background is about @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the vacuum  background is in fact full of various gauge fields , virtual matter - antimatter pairs .",
    "this implies a strong coupling between the particle and the vacuumbackground .",
    "\\(2 ) one should distinguish two sorts of coherence lengths : the coherence length @xmath12 given by eq .",
    "( [ coherencelength ] ) and the ordinary thermal de broglie wave length . in the non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "the thermal de broglie wave length reflects the spatial coherence length which is @xmath26 .",
    "we stress that @xmath12 and @xmath19 have different physical origins .",
    "@xmath12 originates from the coupling between the particle and the vacuum  background .",
    "because of the extremely high temperature of the vacuum  background and strong coupling , the special relativity and quantum mechanics are used to calculate @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath12 , @xmath19 originates from the coupling or interaction between the particle we studied and other particles or environment . to clearly elaborate this",
    ", we take a hydrogen atom as an example , which consisting of an electron and a proton . for a system consisting of a large number of hydrogen atoms , @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the ordinary temperature in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath19 physically originates from the interatomic interaction or the coupling with the environment . for bose - einstein condensation of atomic hydrogen @xcite",
    ", @xmath19 can arrive at @xmath29 .",
    "for the proton in a hydrogen , the coherence length of the proton is about the diameter of the hydrogen atom , _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath30 .",
    "this sort of @xmath31 can be obtained through the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "it is clear that @xmath31 physically originates from the electromagnetic interaction between proton and electron in a same hydrogen . for the quark in the proton ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath32 of the quark is about the radius of the proton ( which is about @xmath33 ) . because the proton is composed of three quarks , we approximate the quark mass ( rather than the naked  quarks ) as one third of the proton mass . from eq .",
    "( [ coherencelength ] ) , we have @xmath34 @xmath35 for the quark . quite interesting , @xmath32 agrees with this value of @xmath12 .",
    "this is understandable , because the quark in the proton has strong coupling with the vaccum  background due to strong interaction .",
    "this means that the coherence length of quarks should be always of the order of several @xmath36 . for a free quark",
    ", its velocity uncertainty could be smaller than @xmath8 in principle , and thus larger than @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the existence of a free quark contradicts with the coherence length of @xmath12 .",
    "this implies in a simple way the well - known quark confinement .",
    "( 3 ) because @xmath19 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 have different physical origin , they have different physical significance .",
    "in particular , for the situations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath19 still has physical significance for a whole atom . for sufficient low temperature",
    ", there is still bose - einstein condensation of dilute atomic gas , regarded of much smaller @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath39 is due to the fact that when interatomic interaction is addressed , the freedom of internal motion of proton and electron in an atom is frozen out .",
    "it is similar for @xmath31 , because the quark confinement means that the interaction between quark and vacuum  background is screened . in a sense",
    ", the strong coupling between the quark and vacuumbackground is blurred when the coherence effect of the whole atom or proton is addressed . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we show @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath19 for an atom",
    ". nevertheless , we will show in due course that the presence of @xmath11 and thus eq . ( [ entropy ] ) will play important role in the derivation of gravity .",
    "\\(4 ) because of the blurred  effect for @xmath11 ( @xmath41 ) , one expects that the gravity between two atoms is negligible , compared with other interactions . for example , it is clear that the formation of bose - einstein condensation of dilute atomic gases is completely irrelevant to the gravity interaction between atoms . because the entropy is an extensive quantity , eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) can be directly generalized to an object comprising of a large number of fundamental particles . in this situation",
    ", @xmath0 can be very large for sufficiently large mass of an object , and the gravity between different objects will play important role .",
    "the unruh temperature @xcite is the effective temperature experienced by a uniformly accelerating object in a vacuum field . here",
    "we give a simple derivation of unruh effect from eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) . considering a particle with acceleration @xmath42",
    ", we have @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 can be also regarded as the relative velocity of a reference system . from eq .",

    "( [ entropyalpha ] ) and ( [ unruh ] ) , it is easy to get the following inertia law@xmath51",
    "following the verlinde s idea , we give a derivation of newton s law of gravitation . in our derivation",
    ", we will stress the local thermal equilibrium and the coherence length of the fluctuating vacuum  background .",
    "we consider the emergent force between two objects with mass @xmath52 and @xmath4 , shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . to solve this problem , we first consider the situation shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , where the mass @xmath53 is uniformly distributed in a region between two spherical surfaces with radius @xmath54 and @xmath55 . assuming @xmath56 , the overall volume of this region is @xmath57 .",
    "this region is divided into @xmath58 equal parts . in this situation , in every part , the mass is @xmath59 .",
    "2(c ) gives a cross section diagram of fig .",
    "we consider the emergent force with the vacuum  background as the medium .",
    "more precisely , both objects have strong coupling with the vacuum  background , and local thermal equilibrium will result in an emergent force .",
    "because the coupling with the vacuumbackground is considered , special relativity should be used from the beginning . from the mass - energy relation @xmath60",
    ", we get an effective temperature @xmath61 , determined by@xmath62for a particle with @xmath4 approaching this sphere , the unruh temperature @xmath63 of this particle should be equal to @xmath61 because of thermal equilibrium , i.e.@xmath64by using the unruh formula ( [ unruh ] ) , we get @xmath65by introducing the gravitation constant @xmath66 , we get @xmath67 , which is just the planck length",
    ". we will discuss the origin of this planck length in due course . in the above derivation",
    ", the unruh formula is used , while eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) formula is not directly used .",
    "there is another derivation of eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) by using eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) . for the particle @xmath4 , we have@xmath68using eq . ( [ thermalequilibrium ] ) , we get@xmath69using further eq . ( [ entropy ] ) , we get@xmath70from eq .",
    "( [ ga ] ) ( derived using unruh s formula ) and ( [ gf ] ) ( derived using eq . ( [ entropy ] ) ) , we get the result of the inertia law @xmath71 .",

    "( [ entropy ] ) , thermodynamical relation and unruh formula . based on the consideration of central symmetry , we get further@xmath72 compared with verlinde s work , the merit of the above derivation lies in that the role of local thermal equilibrium is stressed in the derivation of the newton s law of gravitation .",
    "now we turn to consider an object of mass @xmath73 locating at the position in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) . from gauss s flux theorem and eq .",

    ", there is an effective vacuum  temperature due to the presence of @xmath52.@xmath76this leads to a physical picture that the presence of @xmath52 establishes an effective temperature field distribution .",
    "we assume that the object with mass @xmath52 is uniformly distributed in the sphere with radius @xmath77 .",
    "( [ mtemperature ] ) can be used to calculate @xmath61 for @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , however , using eq .",

    "this provides a physical mechanism why in the previous calculation of @xmath61 based on eq .",
    "( [ tm ] ) , the smallest region for the distribution of @xmath52 is @xmath86 .    .",
    "]    we stress that even the vacuumbackground is completely continuous and smooth , there is still the coarse distribution of @xmath52 due to gravitation , which originates from the coupling between matter and the vacuumbackground",
    ". nevertheless , the above analysis gives a possible physical mechanism for the coarse graining of the space with the planck length @xmath87 .",
    "here we consider further the physical significance of the planck length @xmath88 .",
    "the coarse graining of the vacuum  background with length @xmath87 means that the vacuum  energy in the smallest space unit is@xmath89by using the mass - energy relation , the effective mass in this space unit is@xmath90the coherence length of the vacuum  background is then@xmath91we see that @xmath87 gives also the coherence length of the vacuum  fluctuations .",
    "this implies strongly again the coarse graining of space with the planck length @xmath87 .",
    "one may argue that if there are vacuumfluctuations with a finite coherence length @xmath12 , the increasing of @xmath92 will lower the overall energy of the vacuum  background , and thus is energy stable for infinite @xmath12 .",
    "based on the understanding of gauge theory , however , it is well - known that @xmath12 should be finite and the vacuum  energy density should be nonzero .",
    "therefore , a more natural question is what length of @xmath87 will make the vacuum  background dynamically and thermodynamically stable . as shown above , the gravitation is no longer a fundamental force .",
    "it physically originates from the coupling between matter and vacuum  background through gauge field .",

    ", we have @xmath98 . as emphasized above",
    ", this extremely high temperature is the thermal equilibrium due to the finite coherence length of highly fluctuating vacuum  background and the gravity between these fluctuating vacuum  background .",
    "this extremely high temperature of the vacuum  background also means that the assumption of strong coupling between an object and the vacuum  background in deriving the universal gravity is reasonable .",
    "it is well known that the equivalence principle is based on the assumption that the gravitational mass @xmath99 is equal to the inertial mass @xmath100 .",
    "it is still a mystery why @xmath101 because it seems that the gravitational mass and inertial mass are completely different physical concept , if the universal gravitation is still regarded as a fundamental force .",
    "the above analysis has shown that newton s law of gravitation can be derived from the special relativity where the symbols @xmath52 and @xmath4 can both be regarded as the mass in the mass - energy relation . in all our derivations , we do not need especially introduce the gravitational mass at all . in this situation ,",
    "the gravitational mass and inertial mass are in fact the same physical concept .",
    "hence , the weak equivalence principle is also a derivable law from special relativity , quantum mechanics and true fundamental forces .",
