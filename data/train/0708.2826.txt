    "manganese oxides , such as la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , commonly referred to as manganites , have attracted an intensive theoretical and experimental effort,@xcite mainly due to their property of colossal magnetoresistance@xcite and its consequent applications to magnetic recording devices .",
    "general applications of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic phase of manganites belong to the field of spintronics@xcite where the spin of the electrons is exploited in addition to its charge .    a simple spintronics device which is relevant for the present study is formed by a quantum dot ( qd),@xcite a nanometer - scale box , connected to two fm leads.@xcite this device can act as a spin valve@xcite or a spin filter .",
    "ferromagnetic metals ( co , pd - ni ) or diluted magnetic semiconductors , such as gamnas , are employed as leads .",
    "alternatively , manganites are also used as fm leads in spintronics@xcite because of its high polarization .",
    "manganites are usually described by the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model ( fklm ) in which the conduction sites represent the orbitals @xmath3 and the localized spins the orbitals @xmath4.@xcite the qd will be described as a single anderson impurity .",
    "the spin valve with manganites as leads corresponds then to a fklm with an anderson impurity which is the model we will study in the present work .",
    "moreover , we will consider this model in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) space .",
    "one should keep in mind also that the magnetoresistance of manganites is usually applied in multilayer heterostructures fm / m / fm or fm / i / fm ( m : metal , i : insulator ) which can be considered as 1d systems in the direction perpendicular to the interface.@xcite    this model , in addition to its application to a wide class of devices , could describe other more conventional condensed matter systems such as a transition metal ion such as cu replacing mn in a manganese oxide chain.@xcite it is well - known that a single impurity could lead to interesting and important local or short - range effects in magnetic systems in low dimensions.@xcite these effects can in turn modify the long - range physics of such systems for a finite density of impurities .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to search in the parameter space of the model for phases in which the saturated fm is reduced to a partially polarized fm , or even to a nonmagnetic state , upon the introduction of an anderson impurity",
    ". this problem would be the analog for a ferromagnetic chain of the effect that causes a magnetic impurity in a paramagnetic metallic chain , that is , the paradigmatic kondo effect.@xcite we would like to emphasize that finite size effects due to our finite - cluster calculations could be relevant both to describe mesoscopic devices and to capture local or short - range features caused by an impurity in a mn - o chain . for completeness , since the model studied may be applied to electronic devices , we will compute the conductance through the qd but clearly the study of transport properties is not the main motivation for the present work . in any case , even though the physics found for most of the parameter space corresponds to the saturated fm phase and hence transport properties can be recovered by a spinless fermion model , the impurity - fklm is an interesting testing ground for the quite recent numerical techniques we will employ for this study .    ) .",

    "hence , in this article we will study a one - dimensional fklm with an anderson impurity located in the center of the chain ( see fig .",

    "the anderson impurity or  qd \" , with parameters @xmath6 , is located at site  0 \" and is connected to the rest of the system with a hopping @xmath7 . the  leads \" ( @xmath8 ) correspond to the fklm with the hund s rule exchange coupling @xmath9 .",

    "would be fixed by chemistry but in a spin valve it would correspond to the gate voltage which can be varied at will . in order to detect any departure from the fully polarized fm state",

    "we denote with @xmath23 the total length of the system including the impurity site .",
    "open boundary conditions ( obc ) were adopted in the lattices studied except otherwise stated .",
    "small clusters with @xmath23 up to 12 will be studied using exact diagonalization ( ed ) with the lanczos algorithm .",
    "larger clusters will be solved using density matrix - renormalization group ( dmrg).@xcite for calculations in the subspace of maximum total z - component of the spin , @xmath24 , i.e. , saturated ferromagnetism , we used completely independent ed and dmrg codes for the spinless fermion model .",
    "the ed and dmrg codes for the fklm were thoroughly checked , in the first place by reproducing results in the literature . in the second place , by comparing results obtained by both techniques in small clusters and finally , by comparing results for large chains between fklm and the spinless fermion model in the case of maximum @xmath24 . here",
    "we would like to stress the fact that convergence to the ground state , both with ed and in the diagonalization of the superblock hamiltonian at each iteration of dmrg is extremely slow .",

    "the convergence is even worst for the fklm where previous studies have been limited to @xmath26 with a discarded weight of order @xmath27.@xcite last but not least , the presence of impurities makes the convergence more difficult particularly for dmrg . in our calculations , with a retained number of @xmath28 , the truncation error is negligible ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath30 in the regions close to saturated ferromagnetism but it drops to @xmath31 in the nonmagnetic region . in the case of the spinless fermion model , for @xmath30 and @xmath28 ,",

    ", the energy in the @xmath22 subspace reproduces the value obtained in the @xmath33 subspace using the spinless fermion model within at least 9 digits . in any case",
    ", the limited precision within dmrg depends essentially on the lack of convergence in the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the conductance will be estimated by a numerical setup@xcite in which a small bias voltage is applied to the left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads , with @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 ) , at time @xmath36 .",
    "the current @xmath37 induced by this voltage on each bond connecting the qd to the leads is computed with the time evolution formalism both within ed or dmrg.@xcite this numerical setup is equivalent to the systems which were treated analytically using the keldysh green functions formalism.@xcite these results for out - of equilibrium , with interacting qd , contain as particular cases the ones for noninteracting systems described by the landauer formula.@xcite these analytical results , both for interacting and noninteracting qds , were recovered using this numerical setup and time - dependent dmrg.@xcite the advantage of this numerical procedure is that it can be extended with no formal limitations to study the case of _ interacting leads_@xcite as will be done in the present work .    in principle , one could adopt as a measure of the conductance the maximum of @xmath38 .",
    "it has been shown that this recipe provides correct results for the conductance when the maximum of @xmath37 corresponds to a  plateau \" which appears in high - precision calculations using the  adaptive \" time - dependent - dmrg on large clusters.@xcite in the following we adopt the less precise  static \" algorithm@xcite which still gives qualitatively correct results , particularly if relatively small clusters are considered , but is much faster than the  adaptive \" scheme , thus allowing to explore a wider range of couplings and densities . in the case of ed ,",
    "the time evolution is exactly computed in the full hilbert space of the system .",
    "the time - evolution of the ground state is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the electron occupancies of the left and right leads respectively , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "the symmetric point of an anderson impurity is in principle the obvious place to look for a magnetic impurity placed in a noninteracting chain .",
    "however , this is not the case for the present model . it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) that the qd or impurity occupancy , and hence its actual magnetic or nonmagnetic character , experiences a sharp crossover as a function of the on - site potential of the impurity . for values of @xmath20 larger than a crossover value @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and for values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath57 may be defined as the value of @xmath20 at which @xmath61 .",

    "the crossover between both variational states at @xmath65 is quite close to @xmath57 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 with @xmath48 is mainly due to the kinetic energy which can be easily computed within the spinless fermion model to which the fklm is reduced in the saturated fm state , i.e. when total spin @xmath66 . in this case , neglecting the term with @xmath7 , @xmath67 is equal to the single particle energy of the top of the band which increases with @xmath48 and is exactly zero at @xmath50 .",
    "the connection between both models implies that @xmath68 .",
    "it is important to notice at this point that although the pure system is in the saturated fm state for the densities studied , for some impurity parameters the impurity may drive the system into partially polarized fm states with total spin @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig2](b ) for @xmath50 , there is a region of @xmath20 , close to @xmath57 , where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) for even ( odd ) @xmath63 .",
    "we have observed this nonmagnetic state for other chain lengths and densities .",
    "although the difference in energy between states with different @xmath24 is very small , these results strongly suggest that there are regions in parameter space where the impurity causes a breakdown of the fully saturated fm state . this possibility will be thoroughly examined in the next section .",
    "let us discuss in detail how the conductance @xmath72 is determined . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , it is shown @xmath38 ( @xmath37 is the average of the current on the two bonds connecting the qd to the leads ) which presents the typical oscillatory behavior .",
    "this oscillatory behavior follows from the expansion of @xmath73 in eigenvectors of @xmath74 , which for small @xmath75 are adiabatically related to those of @xmath76 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) are exact , i.e. , no truncation of the hilbert space was performed .",
    "then , we fit each curve by a sinusoidal and we adopt @xmath72 as the amplitude of this sinusoidal . in this small cluster , but also for @xmath77 , a single sinusoidal gives a reasonable fitting of @xmath38 for most of the cases studied , particularly near @xmath57 .",
    "although this procedure is not very precise , it gives qualitatively correct results as we discuss in the following .",
    "results for the conductance are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) for various densities as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath72 is only different from zero at the crossover between the region of empty qd ( @xmath78 ) and the region of half - filled qd ( @xmath79 ) and it has a sharp peak at @xmath57 with a width approximately equal to the bandwidth of a tight - binding model on the leads , @xmath80 .",
    "this behavior is what one would expect for the spinless fermion model .",
    "the determination of the variation of the maximum conductance with density @xmath48 , which would require calculations on a finer mesh in @xmath20 , is out of the scope of the present study .    , for several electron densities @xmath48 indicated on the plot .",

    "this crossover is located approximately at @xmath87 as argued before , even inside the incommensurate ( ic ) phase ( but not strictly at @xmath88 ) , which is expected since the variational states are independent of the underlying fm or ic order . as in the @xmath55 cluster",

    "the kinetic energy is no longer approximated by the spinless fermion model .",
    "in fact , it is easy to realize that the kinetic energy versus @xmath20 follows an _ opposite _ behavior as the ic - fm border is crossed .",

    "the correlations between the impurity site and the localized spins have the same qualitative behavior so in this and in the following section we will only consider the correlations between the impurity and the conduction sites .",
    "these correlations , shown in fig .  [ fig3](d ) for @xmath84 , clearly depart from the correlations in the pure system as @xmath97 is increased .",

    "this value of @xmath21 is somewhat larger than the one in materials employed in the qd , such as semiconductors or carbon nanotubes .",
    "it is necessary then that the device could be operated away from the symmetric point .",
    "more importantly , a smaller @xmath21 could imply a larger effective coupling between the impurity and the conduction sites , assuming that to lowest approximation the relation @xmath103 is still valid for the present model for @xmath104 . in support of this hypothesis ,",

    "figure  [ fig7](d ) and ( e ) show the energy and intensity of the centroid of the main peaks in the high- and low-@xmath140 parts of the spectrum for values of @xmath20 in the three regions of total spin @xmath16 above discussed . in the @xmath123 and @xmath125 regions the peaks with largest weight",
    "are those with energy close to @xmath96 which corresponds to the magnon excitation .",
    "this behavior is strikingly different to the one in the @xmath70 region where the most weighted peak form a dispersionless band at the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "this band is reminiscent of the one found in gapped spin systems upon doping with nonmagnetic impurities.@xcite in the present case , these low - energy peaks may correspond to magnetic excitations living in a  cloud \" surrounding the impurity that can be observed in real - space in fig .",

    "we have applied both well - established and recently developed numerical approaches to study the fklm with an anderson impurity in the fm phase on finite chains .",
    "we found that the magnetic or nonmagnetic character of the impurity is determined by a relationship between the impurity parameters and the hund s rule exchange coupling of the manganite .",
    "as expected , transport occurs at the crossovers between the empty , half - filled or filled qd regions .    the most important result of this article is the presence of an intermediate singlet phase between the fully saturated phases with @xmath32 ( empty impurity ) or @xmath125 ( doubly occupied impurity ) .",
    "this problem has some resemblance with the problem of the existence of an intermediate phase between two ordered states in the frustrated heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "this intermediate phase had been predicted by ed studies on small clusters.@xcite the alternative view was a first order quantum phase transition between both ordered phases .",
    "only recently was this controversy being settled favouring the existence of the intermediate state@xcite but the nature of this phase is still a subject of active research.@xcite of course the physics involved in both problems is completely different , but by analogy , in our problem , we could consider the possibility of a first - order transition between two fm states instead of the proposed intermediate nonmagnetic phase . by comparing the models involved in these two problems , fklm and frustrated heisenberg model ,",
    "the former is much more difficult to analyze than the latter by numerical techniques since the size of the hilbert space is much larger for a given cluster and moreover taking into account the convergence problems discussed in section  [ model ] .",
    "these difficulties prevent us to perform an extrapolation in order to decide if this intermediate phase really exists in the bulk limit or if it is just how the transition between the @xmath32 and @xmath125 phases manifests in finite systems .    in any case , the possibility of the existence of this intermediate state is in principle interesting and important and it deserves further study . in this sense , there are three issues that should be considered .",
    "the first one is that this intermediate phase could be stabilized by some modifications of the model , for example by including the heisenberg interaction between localized spins , or by replacing the spin-1/2 localized spins by higher spin ones which , in addition , are also more realistic for manganites .",
    "the second issue is that even if this intermediate phase has a finite range around an impurity , a _ finite density _ of impurities could lead to a macroscopic feature .",
    "the situation here is analog to the presence of nonmagnetic impurities in the above mentioned gapped systems.@xcite in these systems a single impurity attracts locally a spinon to the impurity and a finite density of impurities drives the system to a long - range af order .",
    "these two issues are currently under study.@xcite the third issue we would like to consider is related to the relevance of the present model to devices with _",
    "finite _ dimensions . in these mesoscopic systems , as discussed in introductory textbooks,@xcite due to its finite size , many physical properties are different to that found in bulk systems .",
    "it is then relevant for these devices to capture short - range effects .",
    "finally , we would like to provide a qualitative scenario to help understanding this nonmagnetic state .",
    "let us assume that the system is in a low @xmath24 state . in the region where the impurity is empty or double occupied , both ",
    "leads \" are relatively disconnected and each one would have a ferromagnetic state with spins polarized in one direction and the other with spins polarized in the opposite direction .",
    "of course this state is degenerate with the one with reversed polarizations .",
    "now , when the impurity is singly occupied , not only it would have a definite magnetic character but it would allow the crossing of one electron from one lead to the other where it would have then a  wrong \" spin .",
    "this kind of magnons would then decrease the total energy both by increasing the kinetic energy and by decreasing the magnetic energy due to an effective af interaction with the impurity .",
    "of course , this gain in energy would not occur for the fully polarized system so it would drive the system to lower @xmath16 and presumably to @xmath145.@xcite it is interesting to notice that this scenario would then imply an enhancement of transport in the system which could be relevant for the devices mentioned in the introduction .    in summary ,",
    "we present a prediction on the magnetic state of the fklm doped with a magnetic impurity .",
    "this prediction could be experimentally verified on cu - doped manganite nanotubes .",
    "these results could also be in principle reproduced experimentally on spin valves where manganites are used as ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we hope the present results will encourage theoretical studies to further characterize this proposed intermediate phase and to explore its presence in more realistic models for manganites .                            c. h. ahn , a. bhattacharya , m. di ventra , j. n. eckstein , c. d. frisbie , m. e. gershenson , a. m. goldman , i. h. inoue , j. mannhart , a. j. millis , a. f. morpurgo , d. natelson , j .-",
