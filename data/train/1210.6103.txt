    "two years ago the alpha collaboration demonstrated trapping of @xmath0 atoms.@xcite this result was quickly followed by an improvement in the trapping rate and a measurement of the lifetime of @xmath0 s in the trap ; @xmath0 were shown to be trapped for longer than 15  minutes.@xcite the long time that the @xmath0 s remain trapped is important because it opens the possibilities to performing measurements that might require several minutes .",
    "alpha was able to use the long trapping time to perform the first measurement of resonant transitions between @xmath0 bound states.@xcite recently , the atrap collaboration have also published results where they claim to have trapped @xmath0.@xcite    one of the difficulties in measuring the spectroscopic transitions in @xmath0 is that the trapped @xmath0 s are currently at relatively high energies which will lead to line broadening from the doppler effect and from zeeman shifts . to date , the trapped @xmath0 are formed using three body recombination@xcite when an antiproton ( @xmath3 ) is inside of a positron ( e@xmath4 ) plasma . because three body recombination is a relatively slow process at the densities and temperatures in the @xmath0 traps compared to collisional slowing@xcite , it is estimated that the @xmath3 will approximately be in thermal equilibrium with the e@xmath4 plasma before recombination occurs .",
    "typical temperatures reported for the e@xmath4 plasma have been a couple 10 s of kelvin .",
    "since the magnetic trap depth for @xmath0 is only @xmath5  k , the @xmath0 s have an energy distribution that extends from 0 to the trap depth .",
    "this was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite where the distribution of @xmath0 annihilations as a function of time or as a function of axial position of the trap matched that for the expected @xmath0 energy distribution .    currently , trapped",
    "@xmath0 atoms have energies up to @xmath6  mk , and occupy a large volume of order ( 2 cm)@xmath7  30 cm .",
    "they are in a strongly non - uniform magnetic field , varying by order 1  t@xcite , from the center to the walls of the trap .",
    "while a number of important experiments have been performed or planned in such a trap , laser cooling of @xmath0 , if achieved , will provide a major experimental advantage .",
    "laser cooling will create a cold , and spatially localized sample of antimatter atoms .",
    "localized atoms will be much less susceptible to the zeeman effect , currently a dominant limitation for microwave spectroscopy@xcite , and one of the limitations for future laser spectroscopy@xcite",
    ". the lower velocities of cooled atoms will reduce 2nd order doppler broadening for 1s-2s two photon spectroscopy .",
    "importantly , laser cooling will greatly increase the sensitivity for observing gravitational interaction of antimatter ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "only one experiment so far has reported laser cooling of atomic hydrogen , nearly 20 years ago@xcite . in that experiment , @xmath8 atomic hydrogen at 80  mk ,",
    "pre - cooled via evaporative cooling , was laser cooled to 8  mk in 15 min . while it is theoretically possible to cool the @xmath0 s in a similar manner , @xmath0 laser cooling presents considerable experimental challenge for several reasons : ( 1 ) generation of coherent radiation at 121.6 nm remains technologically difficult , due to the lack of convenient lasers and nonlinear crystals at these wavelengths .",
    "( 2 ) experimental requirements for @xmath0 trapping allow only limited optical access to the trapped atoms .",
    "( 3 ) because of the very low densities of @xmath0 , three - dimensional cooling assisted by collisionally mixing the degrees of freedom ( needed for laser cooling of atomic hydrogen@xcite ) is prohibitive . ( 4 ) because of the large zeeman effects , only a small portion of the trapped atoms resonantly interact with photons .",
    "several proposals exist for overcoming some of these challenges@xcite , but none has been experimentally realized .",
    "reference  @xcite demonstrated laser cooling of magnetically trapped na atoms to @xmath9  mk using a one - dimensional optical molasses .",
    "this experiment showed that it is possible to obtain substantial cooling even with the severe restriction to one laser . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate whether this simpler scheme for laser cooling of @xmath0 will work , and show , via detailed numerical calculations for alpha - type apparatus , that three - dimension cooling to @xmath2  mk should be possible within realistic experimental and technological constraints .    in our scheme",
    ", the doppler cooling@xcite will drive the @xmath1 transition with the light being linearly polarized perpendicular to the quantization axis in order to drive the @xmath10 to @xmath11 transition . by driving this transition",
    ", the light scattering does not lead to a spin - flip which would cause the atom to be ejected from the trap@xcite .",
    "while a powerful narrow - line cw lyman - alpha laser could eventually offer advantages in laser cooling , development of such sources remain considerable challenge@xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the use of a modern pulsed lyman - alpha source@xcite , whose time - averaged ( as well as instantaneous ) power is much greater than cw . because lyman - alpha generation requires highly non - linear processes , a pulsed scheme offers overall better cooling efficiencies , as long as the transition per pulse is not saturated .",
    "a key feature of the present scheme is the exploitation , and the control of the dynamical coupling between the @xmath12- and @xmath13-degrees of freedom .",
    "this will allow three dimensional cooling in an alpha - type apparatus in which optical access is currently limited to one dimension due to constraints for efficient magnetic trapping as well as high sensitivity particle detection.@xcite    while the trapping fields are clearly non - separable in @xmath14 near the walls of the trap , this is not true near the trap center .",
    "the effective potential energy for the @xmath0 s near the trap center _",
    "approximately _ has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath12 is along the trap axis .",
    "since the light is nearly parallel to the trap axis , this nearly separable potential allows fast cooling of the @xmath12-motion but can lead to heating in the @xmath13-coordinates .",
    "however , there is some small coupling between the @xmath12-motion and the @xmath13-motions .",
    "this coupling is the conduit through which we can achieve cooling in all directions .",
    "we _ enhance _ this coupling by the use of non - harmonic magnetic fields in both @xmath13- and @xmath12- directions , in contrast to standard harmonic magnetic traps . in the @xmath13-directions ,",
    "the effective potential is given by @xmath17 , while in the @xmath12-direction we use total of five solenoidal coils to produce the nonlinearity .",
    "three dimensional cooling is possible when the time between photon scatterings is comparable to or longer than the mixing time between all of the degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to non - trivial behavior of the final temperature on the laser power .    in this paper",
    ", we will present results on many of the important aspects for laser cooling in this constrained geometry .",
    "we have investigated the time dependence of the cooling , the energy distribution versus detuning , the optimum detuning , etc . in the results section ,",
    "we give physical reasons for the difficulties in trying to laser cool @xmath0 .",
    "the basic physical situation is that the @xmath0 s classically move through the trap .",
    "when the laser is on _ and _ the atom is within the waist of the field , the atom can scatter a photon .",
    "the atom receives two momentum kicks for each time a photon is scattered : when the photon is absorbed the atom is kicked in the @xmath12-direction and when the photon is emitted the atom is kicked in a random direction .",
    "the size of each momentum kick is @xmath18 kg  m / s .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity kick to an @xmath0 of @xmath19  m / s .",
    "the @xmath0 s cool when the total momentum kick is opposite the momentum of the @xmath0 . in this section ,",
    "we describe the computational techniques we used to model this process .",
    "the @xmath0 s move through a magnetic trap where their de broglie wavelength is much smaller than the trap dimensions .",
    "this means we can solve for their motion using classical forces .",
    "the potential energy for the center of mass motion is equal to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the magnetic moment of the @xmath0 in the @xmath22 state ; @xmath21 is approximately the magnetic moment of the e@xmath4 .",
    "since the precession frequency is much higher than other motional frequency scales , the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "this means the orientation of the positron spin with respect to the magnetic field does not change .",
    "thus , the trapped @xmath0 s experience a potential @xmath25 where the @xmath21 is the magnitude of the magnetic moment and @xmath26 .    to compute the force , we need to obtain @xmath27 where we need to compute the gradient of the magnitude of the magnetic field . because the magnetic field is a very complicated function of the coordinates , we computed it numerically using a central two point difference : @xmath28/dx\\ ] ] and similar operations for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we used @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radius of the trap @xmath33  cm .",
    "although this seems a crude approximation , the error is actually quite small .",
    "the error term in the gradient is @xmath34 ; since @xmath35 , this approximation gives a relative error of @xmath36 which is comparable to the round - off error in this approximation .",
    "one of the big problems in the calculation is that we need to solve for the @xmath0 motion for 100 s of seconds .",
    "we need to be careful that there is no energy drift in the calculation which would either give an unphysical cooling ( which would lead to overly optimistic results ) or an unphysical heating ( which would lead to a suppression of the laser cooling ) .",
    "we found that the adaptive step - size runge - kutta algorithm that worked well for the shorter times needed to model the results in refs .",
    "@xcite was not accurate enough for the present calculations unless we used very small time steps .",
    "we found that the fourth order symplectic integrator@xcite worked well for this calculation . as is usual with symplectic integrators",
    ", we found that the energy varied during the calculation but the variation remained within a small energy region ; thus , there was no energy drift at long times .",
    "we used a time step of 20  @xmath21s in our calculations .",
    "as with our previous investigations , we launched the @xmath0 s within an ellipsoidal region with a flat spatial distribution .",
    "the ellipsoid had a scale length of 0.8  mm in the @xmath13-coordinates and scale length of 8  mm in the @xmath12-coordinate .",
    "the initial velocity distribution was chosen from a thermal distribution with a temperature @xmath37  k except where explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "since the trap depth is only @xmath38  k , our effective velocity distribution is flat in velocity space within a sphere delimited by the trap depth . before turning on the laser pulses , we had the @xmath0 s move through the trap for 2  s plus a random time between 0 and 0.2  s to model the fact that there is a delay between the @xmath0 formation and manipulations done to them .",
    "this time delay allows the @xmath0 to reach somewhat random regions of phase space .",
    "the trapping field is generated using an octupole field to provide radial confinement and mirror coils to provide axial confinement .",
    "we used the approximations in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite for the fields from mirror coils and the octupole field . instead of two mirror coils , we used 5 coils in order to mimic the more complicated magnetic geometry in the alpha - ii trap .",
    "all coils are approximated as two loops with the approximate vector potential of eq .",
    "( a.2 ) of ref .",
    "all coils have a radius @xmath39  mm and @xmath40 .",
    "the two end mirror coils have a loop separation of 8.425  mm and a center - to - center separation of 274  mm .",
    "the other 3 coils are equally spaced between the two end mirror coils .",
    "all 3 of these coils have a loop separation of 8.083  mm .",
    "the purpose of the extra 3 coils is to provide a flatter magnetic field in the center of the trap . without the extra coils ,",
    "the b - field near the center of the trap is quadratic in @xmath41 .",
    "one coil at the center can cancel the quadratic dependence and give a b - field that has a quartic dependence .",
    "the coils at the 1/4 and 3/4 position together with the middle coil can cancel both the quadratic and quartic dependence .",
    "this will give a b - field proportional to @xmath42 near the center of the trap .",
    "we use 3 different currents through these 5 coils : the end mirror coils have the same current and the coils at the 1/4 and 3/4 position have the same current . in most of the calculations , we chose currents to give the flattest possible b - field .",
    "for our coil parameters , this is achieved with 606  a in the end coils , -57.8  a in the coils at the 1/4 and 3/4 position , and -2.5  a in the middle coil .",
    "we did perform calculations with somewhat different currents ; these calculations will be discussed in the results section .",
    "figure 1 shows a slice through the magnetic field given in terms of the zeeman shift in mk units .",
    "the nearly rectangular nature of the contours highlight the nearly separable nature of the potential energy experienced by the @xmath0 s at low energy .",
    "to perform realistic calculations , we need to use parameters for the 121.6  nm light that are within current technical capabilities .",
    "we used parameters suggested to us by t. momose.@xcite we assumed a laser with a 10  hz repetition rate .",
    "we assumed the laser pulse would be on for a short time , @xmath43  ns ; this time is so short that we consider both the absorption and re - emission to happen instantaneously .",
    "we used a laser linewidth ( fwhm ) of 100  mhz .",
    "the total energy in one laser pulse was taken to be 0.1  @xmath21j .",
    "calculations were mostly performed with the laser propagating exactly along the @xmath12-axis and the laser was assumed to be linearly polarized with a waist radius of 10  mm .",
    "some calculations were performed at different directions for laser propagation and will be discussed in the results section .",
    "we used a semiclassical treatment of laser cooling to model the interaction between @xmath0 s and the laser field .",
    "if the atom is within the laser waist , the probability for absorbing a photon during one of the laser pulses is @xmath44 ^ 2 } \\frac{e_{las}}{\\pi w^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the spontaneous decay rate of the @xmath46 state ( @xmath47  mhz @xmath48  mhz ) , @xmath49 is the laser line width ( @xmath50  mhz , fwhm ) , @xmath51 is the detuning of the laser ( combination of laser detuning , doppler shift , and zeeman shift ) , @xmath52 is the energy in the laser pulse , and @xmath53 is the radius of the laser waist . we will measure the laser detuning from the transition at the minimum b - field , @xmath54 , and denote it by @xmath55 .",
    "the doppler shift is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the z - component of the @xmath0 velocity and @xmath58 is the transition frequency between the @xmath22 and @xmath46 states .",
    "the zeeman shift is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the bohr magneton because the @xmath11 upper state shifts more strongly in the magnetic field than the @xmath10 ground state .",
    "thus , the detuning in eq .",
    "( [ eqprob ] ) is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is evaluated at the position of the @xmath0 .",
    "the algorithm to incorporate the photon scattering worked in the following way .",
    "we stepped the @xmath0 using the symplectic time step of 20  @xmath21s .",
    "a laser pulse is sent through the trap every 5000@xmath63 step .",
    "nothing happens if the @xmath0 is outside the waist .",
    "if the @xmath0 is within the waist , we use a random number generator and compare to the probability to scatter a photon in eq .",
    "( [ eqprob ] ) .",
    "if the random number is smaller than this value , then the atom s velocity is modified by the two kicks .",
    "the two kicks give a change in velocity : @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66  m / s ) is the photon momentum divided by the @xmath0 mass and the random direction @xmath67 is opposite the direction of the photon emission . the vector @xmath67 is randomly chosen from the photon emission distribution for a circularly polarized state .",
    "the cooling discussed below should be compared to the cooling in a three - dimensional ( b - field free ) optical molasses .",
    "the lowest average atom energy is when the laser detuning is set to @xmath68 and gives an average energy of @xmath69 . for our laser parameters , the @xmath70  mk .",
    "the recoil energy is @xmath71  mk .",
    "there are two important issues that need to be addressed : what is the best laser detuning and how long is needed to get substantial cooling .",
    "the optimum detuning depends on the laser power for this system because the laser only directly cools one direction which is nearly separable from the other two directions . for our laser parameters",
    ", we found that the detuning should be substantially shifted from the b - field free optical molasses .",
    "we found optimal cooling with the field free detuning when we performed calculations where the laser could cross the trap at a large angle so that there was substantial components in @xmath12- and @xmath72- or @xmath73-directions , but this will not be an option for the alpha experiment .",
    "we can obtain an overview of the cooling through the time dependence of the temperature of the trapped @xmath0 s .",
    "figure  2 shows the average energy of the laser cooled @xmath0 s as a function of the time that the laser is on .",
    "the atoms start with the distribution that is trapped from a 54  k @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the figure shows the results for several possible detunings of the laser .",
    "the solid , dotted , dashed , and dot - dash lines are for the trapping potential in fig .  1 .",
    "discussed below , the dash - dot - dot - dot line is the best cooling that could be obtained when the trapping potential is only from the two mirror coils at @xmath74  mm .",
    "the value of the detunings are given in terms of the optimal value of @xmath75 when @xmath76 .",
    "this figure shows that the most rapid cooling occurs at early times and the cooling rate has substantially slowed near the final times .",
    "a pessimistic interpretation is that this suggests it will take quite a long time to reach the asymptotic temperature .",
    "as will be seen in the figures below , a large fraction of the @xmath0 s seem to cool to energies under 100  mk within 200  s while some @xmath0 s seem to remain at a few 100  mk .",
    "the hotter atoms have substantially fewer photon scatterings compared to the colder atoms .",
    "thus , the colder atoms will interact more with a laser in a spectroscopy experiment which will lead to a somewhat cooler effective temperature .",
    "we also performed calculations for magnetic fields similar to the geometry of the original alpha experiments .",
    "an example is the dash - dot - dot - dot line in fig .  2 .",
    "in this case , the three middle mirror coils are off and the trapping potential has a quadratic dependence on the @xmath12-coordinate .",
    "we found the cooling to be much worse in this case for two reasons .",
    "the quadratic dependence of the magnetic field on @xmath12 means the zeeman shift is substantial for a larger region of space ; this leads to less photon scattering and , hence , a smaller cooling rate .",
    "the other reason is that the quadratic magnetic field gave even less coupling between the @xmath12- and @xmath13-directions ; this led to a longer mixing time and , hence , a smaller cooling rate .",
    "as with the flat @xmath62-field case treated in this paper , we found much improved cooling if the laser is not constrained to be nearly along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "figure  3 shows the time dependence of the energy distribution for different time windows over a 200 second duration . the data in fig .",
    "3 is for when the laser detuning is @xmath77 the field free optimal value of @xmath75 ; since we are using @xmath78 , this means the laser detuning is @xmath79 .",
    "an important point is that the distribution is clearly giving more @xmath0 s at lower energy as the atoms are cooled longer .",
    "this means that substantial laser cooling is possible for this trap geometry over a time scale where @xmath0 s can be trapped .",
    "the average energy of the @xmath0 s has decreased from @xmath80  mk to @xmath81  mk over this time .",
    "a small fraction , @xmath82% , of the atoms are lost in the cooling process .",
    "these are all atoms that were barely trapped and the first couple of photon scatterings gave heating instead of cooling due to the random nature of the laser cooling .",
    "the efficiency of the cooling is naturally of interest .",
    "the average number of photon scatterings by an @xmath0 is @xmath83 for each 40  s time window .",
    "this gives @xmath84 scatterings for the full 200  s of our simulation .",
    "there are 2000 laser pulses during this period which means that there is slightly better than a 1% chance for scattering a photon in a laser pulse . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the speed of an @xmath0 with 330  mk of kinetic energy is approximately 75  m / s and the velocity kick from a photon absorption or emission is approximately 3.3  m / s .",
    "thus , each photon scattered provides a substantial amount of cooling for this detuning and for this duration of cooling .",
    "figure  4 shows the energy distribution of the @xmath0 s during the final 40  s time bin as a function of the detuning of the laser in units of the optimal b - field free detuning .",
    "plots are shown for detunings of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath77 , and @xmath87 .",
    "all cases started with the same energy distribution of @xmath0 s .",
    "it is clear that the detuning leads to strongly differing energy distributions . from this figure",
    ", it appears that the best detuning is @xmath86 the field free value because the peak of the distribution is at the lowest energy .",
    "however , the average final energy is actually lowest for the @xmath77 detuning as seen in the table i. the average initial energy is approximately 340  mk for our simulated trap .",
    "c c c 20 pt@xmath5520 pt&20 pt@xmath8820 pt&20 pt@xmath89 ( mk)20 pt + @xmath85 & @xmath37 & 200 + @xmath86 & @xmath90 & 135 + @xmath77 & @xmath84 & 115 + @xmath87 & @xmath91 & 140 +    from table i , we can gain some insight into how the cooling process works for this @xmath0 trap .",
    "smaller detuning leads to more photon scattering but the photon is more likely to be scattered by atoms with smaller @xmath92 because a smaller doppler shift brings the photon into resonance .",
    "the average change in energy during a single scattering is @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath92 can be small when the @xmath0 is cold _ or _ when the atom is moving nearly perpendicular to the @xmath12-direction .",
    "thus , the small detuning leads to a lot of scattering without much energy removed during the scattering event .",
    "since there is relatively little time between each scattering event , the @xmath0 does not have sufficient time to mix the motion in @xmath14 . but",
    "having too large a detuning leads to a different cooling problem .",
    "simply put , there are too few photons scattered to give effective cooling during the 200  s simulation time .",
    "although fig .  4 seems to clearly favor the @xmath86 detuning , table i gives similar average final energies for @xmath86 , @xmath77 , and @xmath87 detuning .",
    "this is because the larger detuning more strongly cools the higher energy part of the distribution .",
    "this suggests that the optimal strategy might be to change the frequency of the laser so that we start with large detuning at early times and change the frequency to smaller detuning at late times .",
    "we found that this did provide more cooling over the fixed frequency calculation but it was not a qualitative change . in our calculations , we changed the frequency linearly with time . for 200",
    "s , the best case we tested started with @xmath94 detuning initially and finished with @xmath86 detuning .",
    "however , the average final energy was 90  mk .",
    "thus , changing the detuning is probably worth doing only if it is experimentally easy .",
    "one question we wanted to address is what is the final energy distribution if one could cool for very long times . to address this",
    ", we started with cold thermal distributions and allowed them to interact with the laser pulses for 200  s. we found that atoms with an initial temperature of 50  mk cooled to @xmath95  mk in 200  s with either the @xmath86 or the @xmath77 detuning .",
    "therefore , we are presenting results when the atoms start with a thermal distribution at temperature 30  mk .",
    "figure  5 is the same as fig .  3 except for the initial velocity distribution .",
    "in fig .  5 , we start with a thermal distribution with a temperature of 30  mk ( @xmath96  mk ) in order to probe what are the lowest temperatures that are achievable . for this case",
    ", the energy distribution has settled into its final value at late times .",
    "we find that the energy distribution is well approximated by a thermal distribution at a temperature of 20  mk ( @xmath97  mk ) which is shown in the inset .",
    "we note that the usual optical molasses temperature would give a temperature of 4.8  mk for optimal detuning .",
    "thus , the final temperature for this trap and detuning is only a factor of @xmath98 higher than could be achieved with a 3-dimensional molasses .",
    "we do not have calculations for the time required to reach the final distribution when starting from the high temperature case of fig .",
    "however , our estimates indicate that it should be less than the 1000  s trapping seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  6 is the same as fig .  4 except for the initial velocity distribution .",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath77 detuning clearly give better final distributions .",
    "only the @xmath85 detuning is still evolving at the final time .",
    "that case had the distribution evolving to higher energy at late times .",
    "as in fig .  4 , the @xmath86 detuning has the peak at slightly lower energy than the @xmath77 detuning .",
    "however , the average final energy is essentially the same for the two detunings .",
    "table ii shows similar data to that in table i except the starting energy is a thermal distribution with a temperature of 30  mk .",
    "except for the @xmath85 detuning case , the average energy was approximately constant after 120  s which means table ii gives the asymptotic average energy for all detunings except the @xmath85 case .",
    "since almost all of the @xmath0 s are initially trapped , the average initial energy is 45  mk .",
    "the trends present in table i are reflected in the data of table ii as well .",
    "we think these results are quite encouraging for laser cooling since the average final energy for a three dimensional optical molasses is @xmath91  mk for the laser parameters we used in this simulation . the average energy for the @xmath85 detuning case was still increasing at the final time ; we also found that the average energy for the @xmath85 detuning was increasing at the final time when we started with a 50  mk thermal distribution .",
    "the final average energy in that case was @xmath99  mk which means the @xmath85 detuning has an asymptotic average energy which is more than two times higher that for @xmath86 or @xmath77 detuning case .",

    "we increased the coupling by deliberately making a small , non - flat potential in the central region .",
    "we observed an increase in the cooling rate when we increased the current in the central coil to make a potential hill at the center of the trap .",
    "we observed a _ decrease _ in the cooling rate when we made a potential dip at the center of the trap by decreasing the current in the central coil .",
    "however , the increase / decrease of the cooling rate was only apparent when starting with low energy @xmath0 s because the size of the perturbations we tested was at the @xmath43  mk scale .",
    "we have performed calculations related to prospects for laser cooling trapped @xmath0 atoms .",
    "although the standard methods of laser cooling will work equally well for @xmath0 , the experimental restrictions related to access to the atoms , the large magnetic fields present in the traps , and the small wavelength of the light require accurate modeling to address how much cooling is possible in practice .",
    "our calculations use accurate magnetic field geometries and realistic laser parameters . we have found that an asymptotic temperature only a factor of 2 higher than for a three - dimensional optical molasses is possible .",
    "we only simulated the case where the laser light was impinging on the @xmath0 s along the trap axis ; much better cooling is possible if the laser direction is substantially away from 0@xmath102 or 90@xmath102 relative to the trap axis .",
    "small angles did not have a large effect .    in this paper ,",
    "we only presented results for nearly flat magnetic fields because this is clearly the geometry that will be desired for spectroscopic measurements .",
    "if it is possible to use strongly different @xmath62-fields and then have them morph to the flat geometry , then much lower temperatures could be possible .",
    "for example , one might set up a much tighter flat region in @xmath12 using the 5 mirror coils .",
    "after cooling , the @xmath62-field could be changed to that in fig .  1 which would give adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the trap region .",
    "since these possibilities seem likely to be highly machine dependent , we will save these more complicated situations for when the experiments are attempted .",
