    "direct real and virtual photons are now widely considered as very important penetrating probes of the early , hot and dense stage of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent survey ) .",
    "efforts @xcite have been devoted recently to understand the dielectron spectra measured by the ceres collaboration in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + au in the low invariant mass region @xcite and the dimuon spectra measured by the na50 collaboration in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb in the intermediate mass region @xcite .",
    "both experiments point to a significant excess of dileptons above the conventional sources such as electromagnetic decays of light hadrons ( resulting in the hadronic cocktail ) , and correlated semileptonic decays of open charm mesons , and the drell - yan process .",
    "it is commonly believed that , in particular , the ceres data , obtained with lead and sulfur projectiles , could indicate a drastic change of the properties of hadrons , mainly the @xmath0 meson , in a hot and dense surrounding hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "for instance , transport simulations @xcite including in - medium modifications of the light vector meson masses and widths are found to account for the excess of dielectrons . at the same time ",
    "hydrodynamical calculations @xcite , even when supplemented by the in - medium effects , give a dilepton yield which appears to be below the experimental data in the most important invariant mass region , 0.4 gev @xmath1 0.6 gev",
    ". only if one employs chemical off - equilibrium effects , e.g. , parameterized by a finite pion chemical potential @xcite , the agreement of the hydrodynamical model calculations with data can be improved @xcite .    in a recent analysis @xcite we proposed a model with a minimum set of parameters , which describes at the same time the ceres and na50 dilepton data by a thermal source . in spite of its schematic character",
    ", the model is based on the nontrivial observation , made recently as a result of rather involved evaluations of the properties of hadrons near the chiral symmetry restoration , that the dilepton emission rate from a hadron gas at given temperature is fairly well described by the quark  anti - quark annihilation rate at the same temperature in a wide range of invariant masses extending to small values @xcite .",
    "this is called a  duality  of the hadronic and quark - gluon degrees of freedom in describing the emissivity of strongly interacting matter",
    ". such a simplification makes it possible to parameterize the thermal source by a boltzmann like exponential function with effective temperature @xmath2 and a normalization factor @xmath3 which reflects the space - time volume occupied by the thermal source @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable result of such a parameterization is that the dilepton spectra in both the low - mass region , as measured by the ceres collaboration , and the intermediate - mass region , as accessible to the na50 collaboration , can be well described by the two unique parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "also the transverse momentum spectra are well described @xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates a common thermal source seen in different phase space regions and different dilepton channels .    in the present paper",
    "we employ the above mentioned model for the thermal source to analyze the direct real photons in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb . in line with the hadron - quark  duality",
    " we assume that deconfined and hadron matter shine equally bright in a temperature region centered around the critical temperature of chiral symmetry restoration .    an important information , which can be extracted from the photon spectra , is related to the transverse collective flow of matter .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) spectra of dileptons do not give so far such an opportunity , since in the large @xmath4 region , where the flow effect is strongest , the total yield is dominated by the background contributions .",
    "the primary aim of the present note is to show that a thermal source , with parameters adjusted to the ceres and na50 dilepton data , results in a photon spectrum which , when including the background , is in agreement with the data of the wa98 collaboration @xcite for the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb .",
    "for the emission of photons from a thermal source we employ the rate obtained in @xcite for the free quark - gluon plasma at temperature @xmath5 @xmath6 , \\label{eq.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the four - momentum of the photon with transverse momentum @xmath8 and rapidity @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the four - velocity of the medium ; the constant @xmath11 is according to @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "we use units with @xmath13 .",
    "the rate ( [ eq.1 ] ) takes into account the lowest order qcd processes , i.e. the @xmath14 annihilation and the compton like process . for the strong coupling strength we take @xmath15 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , at @xmath16 mev this rate is very close to that of hadron matter when including a quite complete list of reactions of light mesons and the decays of vector mesons .",
    "this gives an additional hint for extending the mentioned hadron - quark  duality  to the real photon sector , at least for temperatures in the region of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "( at much higher temperature , the rate in @xcite is probably more appropriate ; cf .  also @xcite . )    since the thermal photon spectra are thought to be sensitive to the medium s flow we consider here the simplest case of a spherically symmetric expansion with velocity profile @xmath17 , where @xmath18 stands for the radial coordinate and @xmath19 is the radius of the source , so that for a constant velocity parameter @xmath20 the size @xmath19 increases linearly with time @xmath21 . in line with our model of the thermal dilepton source @xcite",
    "we replace the temperature by an effective average temperature @xmath2 , being constant .",
    "within such an approximation one can factorize the space - time volume @xmath22 and the radiation emissivity . performing the space - time integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) one gets the photon spectrum as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . below",
    "we use the uniquely fixed parameters @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 @xmath28 , which have been previously adjusted @xcite to the ceres and na50 dilepton data .",
    "we focus on the direct photon production assuming that the background , related to decays of secondary hadrons , is removed from the corresponding data @xcite . to describe the spectra one also needs the contribution from hard initial processes , like the drell - yan process in dilepton production , which is expected to dominate in the high-@xmath8 region .",
    "the hard photon yield is generated in our study by the event generator pythia @xcite with structure functions mrs d- , default cut - off parameter @xmath29 gev for photons , and intrinsic transverse parton momentum spread @xmath30 0.8 gev , adjusted to the transverse momentum spectra of dileptons in the drell - yan region in @xcite ; otherwise the default switches are used .",
    "higher order calculations are presented in @xcite , but we try to absorb them into an appropriate k factor .    to check the reliability of estimates of the hard component , we compare in fig .  1 the pythia results with the photon data obtained in pp collisions by the e704 collaboration at @xmath31 19.4 gev @xcite ( left part ) and by the ua6 collaboration at @xmath31 24.3 gev @xcite ( right part ) . to reproduce the data one has to include the k factors of 3.2 ( 1.8 ) for @xmath31 19.4 gev ( @xmath31 24.3 gev ) . as seen in fig .  1",
    ", pythia describes then well the data , i.e. the slopes of the spectra , which are in the high-@xmath8 region , @xmath32 gev .",
    "this conclusion is important for the subsequent analysis of the photon data in heavy - ion collisions , where the absolute normalization of the hard production ( i.e. , the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions ) is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "the comparison of our thermal model yield plus the hard yield from pythia with the wa98 data @xcite is displayed in fig .  2 for the case of neglecting the flow , i.e. , @xmath33 , and in fig .  3 for the flow parameter @xmath34 .",
    "( similar to the pythia calculations we simulate the thermal yield eqs .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] , [ eq.3 ] ) by a monte carlo procedure and apply the detector acceptance . ) as seen in fig .  2",
    ", the hard photon production process dominates in the high-@xmath8 region , where we have adjusted the pythia calculation to data . at @xmath35 gev",
    "one can observe the increase of the experimental yield above the hard yield . in this region",
    "secondary processes become important .",
    "one has to stress , however , that in the region of not too large values of @xmath8 any hard photon production calculation based on perturbative qcd is not longer reliable .",
    "in particular , in the region of smaller @xmath8 the pythia results become sensitive to the cut - off parameter @xmath36 .    as can be expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , the contribution from the thermal source strongly depends on the transverse flow . the moderate value of @xmath34 , used in fig .  3 ,",
    "is consistent with the analysis of transverse hadron flow at kinetic decoupling @xcite .",
    "for such a flow parameter one finds good agreement with the data @xcite when adding the thermal yield and the hard contribution ( see fig .  3 ) .    to make more firm conclusions on the role of thermal photons in pb + pb collisions at cern - sps energies",
    ", one needs a more reliable procedure to fix the hard background .",
    "similarly to dileptons , an accurate adjustment of the hard rate at the high-@xmath8 tail requires an improvement of the data statistics .",
    "notice that our present up - scale factor from pythia simulations of pp collisions to heavy - ion data can be considered as an upper bound for the hard radiation .",
    "nevertheless , a remarkable space is left for the secondary radiation .",
    "an additional insight can be gained by an analysis of non - central collisions which should allow a link to pa collisions , where also data are at hand @xcite .",
    "this will be subject of a separate future study .",
    "in summary we analyze the direct photon production in the reaction pb(158 agev ) + pb by using a model with a minimum parameter set , i.e. , the effective temperature and the space - time volume of the thermal source , both ones adjusted to dilepton data in similar central reactions .",
    "the model employs the hadron - quark  duality  for the rate of electromagnetic radiation off matter .",
    "we have shown that our model , supplemented by the hard photon yield as described by pythia , is in good agreement with the wa98 data .",
    "this result supports the assumption of an extended and long - living source of the electromagnetic radiation , which can be seen in both the real and virtual photon channels .",
    "the comparatively large value of the space - time factor @xmath22 in our model can be related to previous expectations on a long - living fireball @xcite or a phase space overpopulation of hadrons @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that our effective temperature parameter @xmath26 mev is in perfect agreement with the temperature parameter needed to describe hadron species ratios @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 is to be considered as average of the temperature , one concludes that the electromagnetic probes indeed point to temperatures above the expected deconfinement temperature .",
    "this corroborates the expectation of exciting deconfined matter in central heavy - ion collisions already at cern - sps energies .",
    "the photon spectra are shown to be useful in extracting information on transverse flow . for firm conclusions , however , the hard photon production processes",
    "must be reliably accessible .",
    "our approach can be contrasted with attempts to interpret the data either without any hard contribution @xcite or by the hard yield alone by tuning parameters .",
    "transport approaches @xcite should smoothly interpolate between these extreme cases .    we expect that the future analysis of the starting experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider rhic at brookhaven national laboratory should deliver a higher value of @xmath2 since the estimated maximum temperatures will be significantly larger .      useful discussions with h.w .",
