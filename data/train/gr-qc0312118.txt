    "space - time asymptotics , the study of isolated gravitational systems at large distances , is important in general relativity because it allows exact definitions of physical quantities which are otherwise not known , such as the mass - energy of a system and the energy flux of gravitational radiation , related by the bondi - sachs energy - loss equation @xcite .",
    "penrose @xcite formulated this using conformal transformations , so that infinite distances and times are rendered finite : infinity becomes a mathematically finite boundary where exact formulas can be derived .",
    "this is now standard textbook theory @xcite , yet fundamental issues remain .",
    "theory describes future null infinity @xmath0 , whereas spatial infinity @xmath1 has a different theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the bondi - sachs energy ( at @xmath0 ) does not necessarily reduce appropriately to the adm energy ( at @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "a surprisingly unresolved question is whether initial data on an asymptotically flat spatial hypersurface ( or past null infinity @xmath2 ) determines final data at @xmath0 .",
    "this presentation summarizes a new approach , described in detail recently @xcite .",
    "the key idea concerns advanced and retarded conformal factors , which do the work of the penrose conformal factor at @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively , while enforcing appropriate structure at @xmath1 . the factors differentially relate physical and conformal null coordinates at infinity .",
    "as a simple example , the schwarzschild space - time with mass @xmath3 in standard coordinates is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the unit sphere .",
    "this can be written in dual - null coordinates @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , as @xmath8 the physical null coordinates @xmath9 are now transformed to conformal null coordinates @xmath10 by , for instance , inversion @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 are rendered finite , @xmath13 .",
    "the null coordinates are differentially related by @xmath14 which are @xmath15 in this case . since the physical metric @xmath16 has an angular part @xmath17 which becomes infinite as @xmath18 , penrose s idea was to regularize it by transforming to a conformal metric @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the conformal factor .",
    "simultaneously , the normal part @xmath21 , which was already regular , is being multiplied by @xmath22 and being transformed by @xmath23 .",
    "the obvious way to keep it regular is to choose @xmath24 then @xmath25 where @xmath26 the conformal metric is regular , actually becoming flat , as @xmath18 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "physical infinity has become a light cone @xmath28 , the light cone at infinity @xcite , as depicted in fig .",
    "spatial infinity @xmath1 becomes a point @xmath29 and the physical space - time @xmath30 lies outside its light cone .",
    "null infinity @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "clearly there is more information in the sub - factors @xmath34 than in the penrose factor @xmath35 alone .",
    "this structure can be used to refine penrose s definition of asymptotic flatness at @xmath31 to include @xmath1 . for obvious reasons , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are called the advanced and retarded conformal factors respectively @xcite . while penrose emphasized the metric transformation ,",
    "now the dual - null coordinate transformation is to be considered in conjunction .    , depicting the advanced and retarded conformal factors @xmath34 .",
    "the physical space - time ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) lies outside this asymptotic light cone .",
    "radiation propagates in from past null infinity @xmath2 ( @xmath40 ) and out to future null infinity @xmath0 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "spatial infinity @xmath1 ( @xmath29 ) is the vertex.,width=188,height=264 ]",
    "the above ideas motivated the following definition @xcite .",
    "a space - time @xmath42 is asymptotically flat if : ( i ) there exists a space - time @xmath43 with boundary @xmath44 and functions @xmath30 on @xmath3 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 in @xmath3 ; ( ii ) @xmath47 is locally a light cone with respect to @xmath48 , with vertex @xmath1 and future and past open cones @xmath0 and @xmath2 respectively ; ( iii ) @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath49 on @xmath31 , and @xmath50 on @xmath47 ; ( iv ) ( @xmath51 ) are @xmath52 on @xmath53 , e.g.  @xmath54 .",
    "differentiability at @xmath1 is more complex , as described subsequently .",
    "the definition recovers the basic conditions of penrose s definition of asymptotic simplicity @xcite , namely @xmath28 and @xmath55 on @xmath31 , with @xmath35 as before ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "also @xmath29 at @xmath1 as desired .",
    "this leaves considerable gauge freedom in the conformal factors @xmath34 , namely @xmath56 for any @xmath52 functions @xmath57 on @xmath53 .",
    "this allows @xmath48 to be fixed so that @xmath47 is locally a metric light cone @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes equality on @xmath47 in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge conditions are @xmath60 and they imply @xmath61 the last two expressions vanish in the usual gauge chosen for @xmath0 @xcite , in which it is a metric cylinder . in the new gauge , @xmath62 as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "the new framework has been implemented using the spin - coefficient or null - tetrad formalism @xcite .",
    "the basic objects are a spin - metric @xmath63 and a spin - basis @xmath64 , or a metric @xmath65 and a null tetrad @xmath66 .",
    "the key result @xcite is that the desired conformal transformations are given by @xmath67 or @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 now denote respectively the advanced and retarded conformal factors .",
    "the physical and conformal tetrad derivative operators are related by @xmath71 and the weighted spin - coefficients are related by @xmath72 these formulae are all inverses of those in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic expansions valid near the whole of @xmath47 , including @xmath1 , can now be developed .",
    "there is a canonical coordinate system near @xmath47 , obtained by propagating the metric spheres at @xmath47 into the physical space - time along null hypersurfaces , generating a dual - null foliation of transverse spatial surfaces .",
    "the null coordinates @xmath73 are related by @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the dual - null gauge entails certain relations between the spin - coefficients @xcite , including @xmath76 .",
    "the conformal freedom can be fixed as before by @xmath77 it is also convenient to introduce a hyperboloidal spatial function @xmath78 which behaves as @xmath79 at @xmath47 , where @xmath80 means @xmath81 and the radial function @xmath82 relates the area form @xmath83 of the transverse surfaces to the area form @xmath84 of a unit sphere . with the asymptotic gauge choice @xmath85 the conformal expansions are determined for the metric light cone as @xmath86 using the spin - coefficient transformations ( [ sc0])([sc1 ] ) , the physical expansions are found to be @xmath87 now it is demanded that @xmath47 be a smoothly embedded metric light cone .",
    "this leads to the following asymptotic behaviour for the remaining conformal weighted spin coefficients : @xmath88 where @xmath89 here means that @xmath90 is regular at @xmath47 , where a function @xmath91 is said to be regular at @xmath47 if the following limits exist : @xmath92 note that this allows angular dependence @xmath93 at @xmath1 , but not boost dependence .",
    "thus for some purposes it may be useful to expand @xmath1 from a point to a sphere . in terms of the physical spin - coefficients ,",
    "this yields @xmath94 these are geometrically motivated conditions , yet they seem to describe a class of space - times with desired physical properties , as follows .",
    "the bondi - sachs energy @xcite at @xmath0 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the area of a transverse surface and integrals @xmath97 refer to transverse surfaces .",
    "similarly , the adm energy @xcite at @xmath1 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath98 where , in the original treatment , it was unclear whether the limit depended on the boost direction @xmath99 , i.e.  on the choice of spatial hypersurface .",
    "these two expressions are not obviously consistent , and indeed , @xmath100 is not the limit of @xmath101 at @xmath1 without some extra assumption @xcite .",
    "these questions can be addressed using the hawking quasi - local mass - energy @xcite , which can be written as @xcite @xmath102 where the second expression follows in vacuo from the definition of complex curvature @xmath103 . in order for the total energy to be finite",
    ", one needs to further expand @xmath104 where @xmath105 are regular at @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath106 in words , @xmath101 exists at @xmath47 , is the limit of the hawking energy , and has a unique limit at @xmath1 in this framework . in order to compare with the adm energy , one can write the leading - order terms in the shears ( [ shear0][shear1 ] ) as @xmath107 which are regular at @xmath47",
    ". then the discrepancy `` @xmath108 '' ( if @xmath100 were extended to from @xmath1 to @xmath31 by the same formula ) is found to be @xmath109 , which is generally non - zero at @xmath31 ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) , but vanishes at @xmath1 ( @xmath112 ) from any direction .",
    "thus the adm energy is the limit of the bondi - sachs energy at spatial infinity in this framework , and also the limit of the hawking energy from any spatial or null direction : @xmath113 this resolution explicitly rests on the additional structure at spatial infinity provided by the advanced and retarded conformal factors @xmath114 .",
    "the asymptotic regularity conditions and expansions ( [ shear0][twist1],[exp0][exp1 ] ) can be used to show , assuming either vacuum or suitable fall - off of the matter fields , that @xmath115 are @xmath116 , as expected on physical grounds . in particular ,",
    "in the vacuum case they imply @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the retarded and advanced bondi - sachs news functions . here ( [ massloss ] ) is the usual bondi - sachs energy - loss equation , showing that the outgoing gravitational radiation carries energy away from the system , with energy density @xmath119 .",
    "similarly ( [ massgain ] ) shows that ingoing gravitational radiation supplies energy to the system . in conformal",
    "null coordinates , @xmath120 which are regular in the limit at @xmath1 .",
    "thus the change in energy from @xmath1 to a section of @xmath31 is finite .",
    "physically this means that the ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation decays near spatial infinity such that its total energy is finite .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize from energy to energy - momentum @xcite .",
    "@xmath121 penrose s conformal framework has been refined using advanced and retarded conformal factors .",
