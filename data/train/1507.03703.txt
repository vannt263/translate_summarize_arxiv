    "fast and accurate predictions of binding free energies between proteins and small organic ligands would have significant impact on designing drugs @xcite and other modulators of biological processes",
    ". the clear relevance of protein - ligand binding affinity prediction in chemical biology and drug discovery has inspired a vast array of physics - based methods ( for a broad review , see @xcite ) , each with a different trade - off between computational accuracy and speed .",
    "on one extreme , molecular docking focuses on speed .",
    "docking algorithms are designed to quickly obtain plausible configurations of a protein - ligand complex .",
    "scoring functions are then used to rank one configuration versus another .",
    "docking programs are commonly assessed by their ability to redock ligands into crystallographic structures from which they have been removed .",
    "comparative studies @xcite and blinded exercises @xcite consistently show that docking methods are adept at generating the native pose but are less competent at giving it the highest rank . in this context",
    ", it is not surprising that docking scores are poorly correlated with binding free energies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , alchemical pathway methods are based on rigorous statistical mechanics .",
    "the methods involve sampling from a series of possibly nonphysical thermodynamic states in between end - states where the receptor and ligand are bound and unbound . in the unbound state , the receptor - ligand nonbonded interaction terms",
    "may be switched off or the species may be physically separated . in accordance to the established statistical mechanics of noncovalent binding @xcite ,",
    "the receptor is usually allowed full flexibility . unfortunately",
    ", sampling a fully flexible complex from multiple statistical distributions along an alchemical pathway generally requires substantial computing resources ; it has been suggested that most published studies are not fully converged @xcite ! even sampling the ligand binding pose is challenging @xcite . to bypass this difficulty ,",
    "most pathway calculations pursue relative binding free energies between similar molecules and assume that the binding mode does not change . in absolute binding free energy calculations , ligand",
    "sampling issues are usually alleviated by confining the molecule to a specific pose @xcite .",
    "within this restricted range of problems , alchemical pathway calculations are amassing a growing track record of accurate prediction ( e.g. @xcite ) . _",
    "the success of these methods suggests that docking may be substantially improved by incorporating rigorous statistical mechanics . _    implicit ligand theory ( ilt ) @xcite , a recently derived statistical mechanics framework for noncovalent association , has the potential to inspire new methods that combine the speed of docking and the rigor of alchemical pathway methods .",
    "ilt formally separates receptor and ligand sampling into two distinct stages .",
    "because the first stage of receptor sampling does not require a ligand , receptor conformations can be sampled once and used with many different ligands .",
    "in contrast , conventional alchemical pathway methods require thorough receptor sampling for every receptor - ligand pair .",
    "the second stage is to calculate the binding potential of mean force ( bpmf ) - the binding free energy between a ligand and a _ rigid _ receptor configuration ( eq . [ eq : bpmf ] ) - for each receptor configuration .",
    "finally , the standard binding free energy is an exponential average of bpmfs ( eq . [ eq : fe_ilt ] ) .",
    "while multiple bpmfs are required to estimate a standard binding free energy , the overall calculation should require less computer time than conventional methods because bpmfs are easier to estimate than binding free energies with a fully flexible receptor .",
    "the key reason for this speedup is that a bpmf calculation only requires sampling of the ligand , which usually has many fewer degrees of freedom than the complex .",
    "furthermore , nonbonded interactions between a rigid receptor and ligand can be treated by interpolating precomputed three - dimensional grids , a strategy first developed for docking @xcite .",
    "once the grid is stored , calculation time no longer depends on the size of the receptor .",
    "in contrast , conventional alchemical pathway methods require frequent force evaluation between flexible receptor atoms . as the number of pairwise interactions scales as @xmath1 with n receptor atoms ( neglecting cutoffs ) , the relative efficiency of ilt - based methods will be more pronounced as receptor size increases .    in the first paper on ilt",
    ", bpmfs were estimated for simple host - guest systems @xcite . here",
    ", the focus is on precise bpmf estimation for protein - ligand systems . @xcite",
    "previously computed binding free energies between simple ligands and a rigid protein , t4 lysozyme .",
    "in contrast , the present work involves more diverse systems .",
    "@xcite were equally rigorous , but did not implement specialized methods to significantly speed their calculations compared to flexible - receptor calculations .",
    "@xcite developed a fast method based on a number of approximations .",
    "as in other bpmf @xcite and standard binding free energy @xcite calculations , hamiltonian replica exchange is applied .",
    "the main methodological differences between the current and previous work are the adaptive initialization of thermodynamic states and the use of linearly - scaled interaction grids @xcite with transformation - based smoothing @xcite ; these will be discussed in detail in the section on _ theory and methods_. the method is demonstrated on the astex diverse set @xcite , a curated database of 85 high - quality protein - ligand complexes of pharmaceutical or agrochemical interest .",
    "the algorithm is implemented in a new software package , alchemical grid dock ( algdock ) , a python module based on the molecular modeling toolkit ( mmtk ) 2.7.8 @xcite .",
    "algdock is available under the open - source mit license at https://github.com / ccbatiit / algdock/.",
    "this section reviews implicit ligand theory , details the algorithms in algdock , and describes the setup of the bpmf calculations on the astex diverse set .      for the noncovalent association between a receptor @xmath2 and ligand @xmath3 to form a complex @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the standard binding free energy is , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inverse of boltzmann s constant times the temperature , @xmath8 is the standard concentration ( 1 m = 1/1660 @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is the equilibrium concentration of species @xmath11 .",
    "activities have been assumed to be unity , a reasonable approximation in the limit of low concentrations .",
    "coordinates of the complex , @xmath12 , are partitioned into receptor ( @xmath13 ) and ligand internal ( @xmath14 ) and external ( @xmath15 ) coordinates .",

    "when results from all simulations between milestones c&d are grouped together , the standard deviation in many systems no longer converges to within 5 @xmath29 . because converged thermodynamic quantities",
    "should not depend on initial conditions , this inconsistency implies that some simulations are not fully converged .    when free energy estimates contradict , it is not completely clear which result is most consistent with the force field .",

    "based on this definition , false convergence occurs in a nontrivial fraction of systems ( table [ tab : nconverged ] ) .",
    "ultimately , poor convergence and false convergence are caused by incomplete sampling .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for incomplete sampling is that a simulation starts and remains trapped in a local minimum distinct from the global minimum energy .",
    "indeed , between milestones c&d , most falsely converged calculations starting from the crystal structure ( 4/5 ) and docked poses ( 7/11 ) have no starting pose within 1.0    of the lowest - energy observed pose . however , sampling the lowest - energy structure is not a sufficient condition for complete sampling , as other poses may have a lower _",
    "free energy_. for simulations starting from the lowest - energy observed pose , four systems appear falsely converged between milestones c&d ( formatted by pdb identifier ( @xmath31 , \\sigma[f , f_{min}]$ ] ) with @xmath33 in units of @xmath29 ) : 1hww ( 0.353 , 16.1 ) , 1r1h ( 3.95 , 15.3 ) , 1hp0 ( 0.496 , 16.7 ) , 1gm8 ( 0.422 , 15.6 ) . for 1hww ( figure [ fig : dock_last](c ) and",
    "( d ) ) and 1gm8 ( figure [ fig : dock_last](g ) and ( h ) ) , starting from the crystallographic pose leads to a lower estimate of @xmath34 than the lowest - energy pose . for 1hp0 ( figure [ fig : dock_last](e ) and",
    "( f ) ) , a docked pose has the lowest estimated @xmath34 .",
    "1r1h does not appear to sample different poses ; the large @xmath32 $ ] is the result of an outlier with a significantly lower @xmath34 estimate than average .",
    "the selection of intermediate states between two thermodynamic milestones of interest is a ubiquitous problem in molecular simulation .",
    "the usual approach is an iterative trial - and - error process starting from a naive protocol , checking for issues such as replica exchange bottlenecks , and inserting and removing states as necessary .",
    "i have developed a simple and robust approach to initialize a series of thermodynamic states based on only a single adjustable parameter , the thermodynamic speed .",
    "due to this automated procedure , i was able to run a large number of simulations on a diverse array of protein - ligand complexes . in the vast majority of cases ,",
    "the protocols yielded consistent replica exchange rates across neighboring thermodynamic states without further fine - tuning .",
    "the described approach to trailblazing thermodynamic state space may find use in other classes of simulations .",
    "replica exchange calculations in this present study include more thermodynamic states than most published molecular simulations .",
    "conventional wisdom about replica exchange is that an optimal number of replicas will maximize efficiency . with too few replicas ,",
    "there is limited phase space overlap between neighbors and exchange rates are vanishingly small . with too many replicas , metrics of replica exchange efficiency , such as a mean round - trip time ,",
    "however , in a recent study involving extensive simulation of several distinct processes , it was found that if there are no bottlenecks , the number of states has little impact on the convergence of free energy estimates ( the manuscript is under preparation ) .",
    "i chose to include a large number of states to allow for the possibility that later sampling will explore different regions of phase space and reduce the exchange rate between neighboring states .",
    "while useful , the described thermodynamic state initialization process remains imperfect .",
    "replica exchange is particularly beneficial when the important phase space of a thermodynamic states is a subset of the important phase space of another .",
    "the present procedure is limited to the variation of a single thermodynamic parameter between milestones , and can do little to promote the subset relationship .",
    "future improvements could accomodate varying multiple parameters ( e.g. separate parameters for the temperture , van der waals grids , and electrostatic grids ) in between thermodynamic states of interest , while maintaining a phase space subset relationship .",
    "while a direct comparison is difficult , the described procedure appears less successful than the best docking programs at identifying the native pose .",
    "@xcite found that with a larger site ( 10  ) , the top - ranked gold solution is within 2    of the experimental binding mode in 80.4% of calculations .",
    "in contrast , only 56.5% of the present ucsf dock 6 calculations were successful , suggesting that setup and parameterization , and perhaps the docking algorithm , could be fine - tuned .",
    "native pose identification based on algdock performs similarly to ucsf dock 6 , suggesting that replica exchange sampling from the boltzmann distribution does not significantly increase the diversity of poses . as evidenced by the variable performance as a function of starting pose(s ) ,",
    "improving boltzmann sampling schemes should improve native pose identification .    nonetheless , the sampling and estimation approach is able to attain precise bpmf estimates in the majority of systems . as for the others ,",
    "it is unsurprising that the same approach does not work equally well in all cases . with a diverse set",
    ", ligands and receptors will exhibit distinct levels of complexity and may be driven to bind by different factors . indeed , the inadequate sampling that led to convergence issues for several systems is probably not unique to bpmf calculations @xcite . because of the relative simplicity of the calculations , i have been able to conduct more replicates from more distinct starting points than other alchemical standard binding free energy calculations .",
    "the sheer number of simulations has allowed us to expose problems that may not be clear from fewer calculations .",
    "our results suggest that hamiltonian replica exchange with molecular dynamics is not always an adequate approach for sampling distinct ligand binding poses .",
    "specialized sampling methods will likely be required in a more broadly effective protein - ligand bpmf estimation procedure .",
    "it is also clear that for some systems , there may be limited phase space overlap between different implicit solvent models .",
    "more precise bpmf estimation can be attained by introducing intermediate states or implementing more similar force fields for milestones a&b and d&e .",
    "i have developed a method to initialize thermodynamic states and estimate bpmfs for protein - ligand systems .",
    "the largest sources of imprecision are found to be ligand pose sampling and phase space overlap between implicit solvent models .",
    "intriguingly , i found that starting from the lowest - energy pose is not a sufficient condition for converged bpmf estimates .",
    "future studies may build on the current work to compare bpmfs with molecular docking scores as classifiers of binding .",
    "another useful direction will be to assess the convergence of standard binding free energy estimates upon increased receptor conformational sampling .",
