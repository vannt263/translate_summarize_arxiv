    "in this paper , we will examine calculation of correlation functions in a logarithmic conformal field theory , which has been derived using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the correspondence which is by now very popular in the string theory literature , maintains that a @xmath0 dimensional conformal theory may arise on the boundary of a @xmath1 dimensional theory defined on an anti de sitter back ground @xcite . since logarithmic conformal field theories ( lcfts )",
    "are singular forms of cfts , one expects that they arise on the boundary too , but perhaps as boundary theories of rather unusual bulk theories @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present discussion is to examine the way one loop correlation functions within lcft may be calculated , if the bulk theory is given .",
    "a method based on feynman graphs which connect to the boundary , has been suggested by witten @xcite , which gives the road map by which correlation functions for the boundary cft can be calculated .",
    "the same method works for lcfts as well .",
    "except that the number of correlation function to calculate for an lcft is very high . in the simplest case , where one has a logarithmic pair , there are sixteen interconnected correlation functions when considering four point functions .",
    "recently we proposed a method for dealing with lcfts based on nilpotent variables @xcite .",
    "this method offers a unified manner by which one can calculated the correlation functions of lcfts @xcite , and easily generalizes to the case of ads / lcft correspondence @xcite .",
    "however its application to the graphs with loops was riddled with some difficulties @xcite . here",
    "we present a method by which these problems are ironed out and we are able to discuss the properties of loop calculations .",
    "to state the ads / lcft correspondence , we briefly recall the conjecture in the frame work of ordinary cft . in this conjecture ,",
    "one relates two different theories : one of them lives in a @xmath1 dimensional ads space , and the other somehow lives on the boundary of this ads space and has conformal invariance .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "consider the action @xmath2 $ ] defined on ads@xmath3 and calculate the partition function of the ads theory subjected to the constraint that the value of @xmath4 on the boundary be @xmath5 @xmath6=\\int_{\\phi_{b } } d\\phi\\exp(-s[\\phi]).\\ ] ] the correspondence states that the partition function of ads theory is the generating functional of the boundary conformal field theory : @xmath7=\\left\\langle \\exp\\left(\\int_{\\partial ads } dx \\hat{o}\\phi_b\\right)\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] the function @xmath8 is considered as a current which couples to the scalar conformal operator @xmath9 via a coupling @xmath10 .",
    "this is an elegant and useful result , since it gives a practical way for calculation of correlation functions of conformal field theory . to begin",
    ", one should first choose a proper action in the bulk .",
    "different actions have been studied and the conformal correlators have been found in these cases . some examples are interacting massive scalar field theory @xcite or interacting scalar spinor field theory @xcite .    on the other hand , it is also interesting to find actions on ads which induce logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) on its boundary .",
    "the bulk action which give rise to logarithmic operators on the boundary were first described in @xcite .",
    "then it was accustomed to the new method for investigating lcfts , i.e. via nilpotent and grassmann variables @xcite . in this new method",
    "a superfield is defined using a grassmannian variable @xmath11 and different components of a logarithmic pair and fermionic fields @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fermionic fields with the same conformal dimension as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the logarithmic partner of @xmath15 . also @xmath17 acts as the nilpotent variable .",
    "now it is easy to see that @xmath18 has the following transformation law @xmath19 if @xmath20 were the logarithmic operator on the boundary of ads , the corresponding field @xmath21 in ads space can be extended as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is ( @xmath1 ) dimensional coordinate with @xmath24 components and @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponds to the boundary . in reference",
    "@xcite we introduced a free action with brst symmetry .",
    "now we write it as the following form @xmath27=-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\omega}d^{d+1}x\\sqrt{|g(x)|}\\int d\\bar{\\eta}d\\eta\\times\\:\\hspace{5cm}\\nonumber\\\\ \\left[\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi(x,\\eta,\\bar{\\eta } ) .",
    "\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi(x,-\\eta,-\\bar{\\eta})+m^{2}(\\eta,\\bar{\\eta } ) \\phi(x,\\eta,\\bar{\\eta})\\phi(x,-\\eta,-\\bar{\\eta})\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are defined to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively and where @xmath33 is the determinant of the metric on ads .    within this framework ,",
    "the ads / lcft correspondence is written in the following form @xmath34\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the value of @xmath21 on the boundary .",
    "then the two point correlation functions were calculated @xcite , though the results were not in closed form and one had to expand @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 to obtain correlation function .    to have non trivial 4 or higher point functions , one should add some kind of interaction to the action ( [ freeaction ] ) . in @xcite",
    "various n - point correlations of superfield components were calculated at tree level by adding an interaction term to the free theory .",
    "again , the results the correlation functions were not found in closed form .",
    "also they had chosen a special form for interaction , more precisely , they have taken the interaction term to be proportional to @xmath41 , but to keep the action brst invariance , the sum of @xmath42 should be zero . the choice made in @xcite is to take half of @xmath42 s equal to @xmath11 and the other half equal to @xmath43 .",
    "is even , if @xmath44 is odd , another choice should be made . ] in this paper we will not restrict ourselves to a specific choice and will consider more general cases .",
    "it turns out that with the new action , nearly all the correlators will have correction , while in @xcite only few term had correction .",
    "it is also important to see what happens when one goes beyond tree level . in ordinary cft s",
    ", witten diagrams have been introduced to calculate n - point functions , perturbatively .",
    "we will generalize this idea to lcft s and will find proper feynman rules to describe the diagrams .    in this paper",
    "we obtain n - point correlation functions of superfields in closed form instead of its components .",
    "this method leads us to generalization of witten diagrams which deal with ordinary fields to the diagrams dealing with superfields .",
    "also by this generalization we can evaluate loop corrections .",
    "in order to find non trivial n - point functions at tree level and loop corrections , one should consider interaction terms in @xmath21 in addition to free theory .",
    "furthermore we wish the action to have brst symmetry so that the correlation functions remain invariant under brst transformations .",
    "we consider the interaction term as @xmath45&=&\\int_{\\omega}d^{d+1}x\\sqrt{|g(x)|}\\int d\\bar{\\eta}_{1}d\\eta_{1}\\cdots d\\bar{\\eta}_{n}d\\eta_{n}\\delta(\\eta_{1}+\\cdots+\\eta_{n})\\delta(\\bar{\\eta}_{1}+\\cdots+\\bar{\\eta}_{n})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[\\frac{1}{n!}\\lambda(\\eta_{1},\\cdots,\\eta_{n},\\bar{\\eta}_{1},\\cdots,\\bar{\\eta}_{n } ) \\phi(x,\\eta_{1},\\bar{\\eta}_{1})\\cdots\\phi(x,\\eta_{n},\\bar{\\eta}_{n})\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the language of superfield , the infinitesimal brst transformation is of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are infinitesimal anti - commuting parameters .",

    "this green function is just the one derived in @xcite multiplied by @xmath64 .",

    "again , because there are two @xmath11 s in the free action , this green function will relate @xmath67 , which lives in the bulk , to @xmath68 , which lives on the boundary : @xmath69 again , one can see that this green function , is just the same as the one derived in @xcite , multiplied by @xmath70 , that is : @xmath71 with @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "so far , we have derived feynman rules for different propagators , the last step to make the discussion complete is derivation of the vertex term , which is present due to presence of interaction in the theory . as the interaction term is proportional to product of @xmath44 @xmath4 s , to each vertex @xmath44 line s",

    "the strength of the interaction is controlled by the coupling constant ( s ) @xmath74 .",

    ". the integration over @xmath23 can be done @xcite and the result is @xmath90 the result is consistent with the one derived before @xcite , in addition , we have found the correlation function in closed form . by expanding ( [ 2point ] ) in powers of @xmath42 s , different correlation functions of the fields @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    "are obtained .",
    "when there is some kind of interaction in the bulk theory , the n - point correlation function will find corrections . in this section , we will find the correction to the first order of @xmath95 or equivalently to tree level .",

    "first of all , it is easy to check that the result is conformal covariant .",

    "so , if the sum of @xmath11 s is non zero , the correlator should vanish .",
    "consequently , the correlator should have a delta function on @xmath11 s as a multiplier .",
    "the other point to be clarified is that our coupling constant is a compound one .",
    "we should expand it in terms of @xmath11 s ( and @xmath52 s ) to find the components .",

    "this happens because we have a delta function on @xmath113s which imposes a constraint on the garassmans .",

    "as the last term is absent , we do not have the @xmath115 vertex .",
    "this leads to vanishing correlator of @xmath116 in cft part , which is a desired result .",
    "also vertices which have odd number of grassmann fields do not exist , but other vertices are present in the theory .",
    "let s investigate the @xmath111 theory more precisely and derive the three point functions explicitly .",
    "this is a good check for our theory , as we know the form of correlators from symmetry .",
    "also , knowing the three point functions , one can say something about ope s of the fields present in the theory .    in this case",
