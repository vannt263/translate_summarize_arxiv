    "the determination of @xmath7 based on the small magellanic cloud can have at least four significant advantages and one disadvantage with respect to those based on distant h   region complexes : a ) no underlying absorption correction for the helium lines is needed because the ionizing stars can be excluded from the observing slit , b ) the determination of the helium ionization correction factor can be estimated by observing different lines of sight of a given h   region , c ) the accuracy of the determination can be estimated by comparing the results derived from different points in a given h   region , d ) the electron temperature is generally smaller than those of metal poorer h   regions reducing the effect of collisional excitation from the metastable 2  @xmath8s level of he  , and e ) the disadvantage is that the correction due to the chemical evolution of the smc is in general larger than for the other systems .",

    "the slit was placed at two different positions of the nebula , five extraction windows were defined in one slit position ( regions 1 - 5 ) and eight in the other ( regions 11 - 18 ) , four of the extraction windows included the brightest ionizing stars ( m@xmath914 ) , while the other 9 positions avoided stars brighter than m = 17 to minimize the stellar contamination of the nebular spectra .",

    "region a was defined to minimize the errors of the emission lines and the effect of stellar underlying absorption ; the main results of this paper will be based on it .",
    "regions 1 and 11 were not included in region a because they are fainter than the others ( see table  [ positions ] ) and the equivalent widths of their emission lines are also smaller ( see the last paragraph of this section ) , both effects could increase the systematic errors .",
