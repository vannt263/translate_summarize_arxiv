    "in the past decade the mutual fund industry has grown rapidly , moving from @xmath0 of taxable household financial assets in 1980 , to @xmath1 in 1990 , to @xmath2 in 2007 . in absolute terms , in 2007 this corresponded to 4.4 trillion usd and 24% of u.s . corporate equity holdings .",
    "mutual funds account for a significant fraction of trading volume in financial markets and have a substantial influence on prices .",
    "this raises the question of who has this influence : are mutual fund investments concentrated in a few dominant large funds , or spread across many funds of similar size ? do we need to worry that a few funds might become so large that they are ",
    "too big to fail \" ?",
    "what are the economic mechanisms that determine the concentration of investment capital in mutual funds ?",
    "large institutional investors are known to play an important role in the market @xcite .",
    "gabaix et al .",
    "recently hypothesized that the fund size distribution plays a central role in explaining the heavy tails in the distribution of both trading volume and price returns .",
    "if their theory is true this would imply that the heavy tails in the distribution of mutual fund size play an important role in determining market risk .    while it is standard in economics to describe distributional inequalities in terms of statistics such as the gini or herfindahl indices , as we show in appendix a",
    ", this approach is inadequate to describe the concentration in the tail . instead , the best way to describe the concentration of assets is in terms of the functional form of the tail .",
    "as is well - known in extreme value theory @xcite , the key distinction is whether all the moments of the distribution are finite .",
    "if the tail is truly concentrated , the tail is a power law , and all the moments above a given threshold , called the tail exponent , are infinite .",
    "so , for example , if the tail of the mutual fund size distribution follows zipf s law as hypothesized by gabaix et al . , i.e. if it were a power law with tail exponent one , this would imply nonexistence of the mean . in this case",
    "the sample estimator fails to converge because the tails are so heavy that with significant probability a single fund can be larger than the rest of the sample combined .",
    "this is true even in the limit as the sample size goes to infinity .",
    "thus power law tails imply a very high degree of concentration .",
    "instead , empirical analysis shows that the tail of the mutual fund size distribution is not a power law , and is well - approximated by a lognormal @xcite .",
    "thus , while the distribution is heavy tailed , it is not as heavy tailed as it would be if the distribution were a power law .",
    "the key difference is that for a log - normal all of the moments exist .",
    "this naturally leads to the question of what economic factors determine the tail properties of the mutual fund distribution .",
    "there are two basic types of explanation .",
    "one type of explanation is based on a detailed description of investor choice , and another is based on efficient markets , which predicts that growth should be random , and that the causes can be understood in terms of a simple random process description of entry , exit and growth .",
    "of course market efficiency depends on investor choice , but the key distinction is that the random process approach does not depend on any of the details , but rather only requires that no one can make superior investments based on simple criteria , such as size .",
    "explanations based on investor choice can in turn be divided into two types : rational and behavioral .",
    "for example , berk and green [ @xcite ] have proposed that investors are rational , making investments based on past performance .",
    "their theory implies that the distribution of fund size is determined by the skill of mutual fund managers and the dependence of transaction costs on size .",
    "if we assume , for example , that the transaction cost is a power law ( which includes linearity ) if the distribution of fund size is log - normal , then it is possible to show that the distribution of mutual fund skill must also be log - normal .",
    "unfortunately , without a method of measuring skill this is difficult to test .",
    "another type of explanation is behavioral , i.e. that investors are strongly influenced by factors such as advertising , fees , and investment fads .",
    "we strongly suspect that this is true , and that they play an important role in determining the size of individual funds .",
    "the question we investigate here is not whether such effects exist , but whether they are essential to explain the form of the distribution .",
    "the alternative is that the details of investor choice do nt matter , and that the distribution of fund size is driven by market efficiency , which dictates an approach based on the random process of entry , exit and growth .",
    "the random process approach was originally pioneered as an explanation for firm size by gibrat , simon and mandelbrot , and is popular in the industrial organization literature .",
    "the basic idea is that while details of investor choice are surely important in determining the size of _ individual _ funds , the details may average out or be treatable as noise , so that in aggregate they do not matter in shaping the overall size distribution .    on the face of it",
    ", however , there seems to be a serious problem with this approach . under simple assumptions about the entry , exit and growth of fund size",
    ", @xcite showed that the steady state solution is a power law ; a similar argument is described in @xcite and @xcite . as already mentioned , however , the upper tail of the empirical distribution is a log - normal , not a power law . thus there would seem to be a contradiction .",
    "apparently either the correct random process is more complicated , or this whole line of attack fails .",
    "we show here that the central problem comes from considering only the steady state ( i.e. infinite time ) solution .",
    "we study the same equations considered by gabaix et al . and reed ,",
    "but we find a more general time - dependent solution , and show that the time required to reach steady state is very long .",
    "the mutual fund industry is rapidly growing and , even if the growth process had been stationary over the last few decades , not enough time has elapsed to reach the stationary solution for the fund size distribution . in the meantime",
    "the solution is well approximated by a log - normal .",
    "this qualitative conclusion is very robust under variations of the assumptions .",
    "in contrast to the hypothesis of berk and green , it does not depend on details such as the distribution of investor skill  the log - normal property emerges automatically from market efficiency and the random multiplicative nature of fund growth .    to test our conjectures more quantitatively we study the empirical properties of entry , exit and growth of mutual funds ,",
    "propose a more accurate model than those previously studied , and show it makes a good prediction of the empirically observed fund size distribution .",
    "the model differs from previous models in that it incorporates the fact that the relative growth rate of funds slows down as they get bigger .",
    "this makes the time needed to approach the steady state solution even longer : whereas the relaxation time for the size - independent diffusion model is several decades , for the more accurate size - dependent model it is more than a century .",
    "market efficiency is the key economic principle that makes the random process model work , and dictates many of its properties .",
    "it enters the story in several ways .",
    "( 1 ) the fact that stock market returns are essentially random implies that growth fluctuations are random , for two reasons : ( a ) without inflows and outflows , under the principle that past returns are not indicative of future returns , fund growth is random .",
    "( b ) although investors chase past returns , since what they are chasing is random , fund growth due to inflow and outflow is random on sufficiently long time scales .",
    "( 2 ) efficiency dictates that mutual fund performance must be independent of size .",
    "thus as mutual funds randomly diffuse through the size space , there is no pressure pushing them toward a particular size .",
    "( 3 ) efficiency , together with the empirical fact that the relative importance of fund inflows and outflows diminishes as funds get bigger , implies that the mean growth rate and the growth diffusion approach a constant in the large size limit .",
    "as we show , this shapes the long - term properties of the size distribution .",
    "all of these points are explained in more detail in section  [ sec : size_change ] .",
    "market efficiency makes mutual funds unusual relative to most other types of firms . for most firms , in the large size",
    "limit the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate are empirically observed to decay to zero . for mutual funds , in contrast , due to market efficiency they both approach a positive limit .",
    "this potentially affects the long - term behavior : most firms approach a solution that is thinner than a log - normal , i.e under stationary growth conditions their tails are getting thinner with time , whereas mutual funds approach a power law , so their tails are getting fatter with time .",
    "nonetheless , as we have already mentioned , even under stationary growth conditions the approach to steady - state takes so long that this is a moot point .    at a broader level our work here shows how the non - stationarity of market conditions can prevent convergence to an  equilibrium \" solution .",
    "nonetheless , even under stationary conditions the random process model usefully describes the time - dependent relationships between entry , exit and growth phenomena on one hand and size on the other hand . while we can not show that the random process model is the only possible explanation , we do show that it provides a good explanation .",
    "the conditions for this are robust , depending only on market efficiency , without the stronger requirements of perfect rationality , or the complications of mapping out the idiosyncrasies of human behavior .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_model ]",
    "we develop the standard exit and entry model .",
    "section  [ section_n ] presents the time - dependent solution for the number of funds , section  [ section_solution ] presents the time - dependent solution for the size distribution , and section  2.3 introduces a size - dependent model .",
    "section  [ data_set ] describes our data . in section  [ section_empiric_justification ]",
    "we perform an empirical analysis to justify our assumptions and to calibrate the model . in section  [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we present simulation results of the proposed model and compare them to the empirical data .",
    "finally section  [ conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "our central thesis in this paper is that due to market efficiency the mutual fund size distribution can be explained by a stochastic process governed by three key underlying processes : the size change of existing mutual funds , the entry of new funds and the exit of existing funds . in this section",
    "we introduce the standard diffusion model and derive a time - dependent solution for the special case when the diffusion process has constant mean and variance .",
    "we then make a proposal for how to model the more general case where the mean and variance depend on size .",
    "the aim of the model we develop here is to describe the time evolution of the size distribution , that is , to solve for the probability density function @xmath3 of funds with size @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the size distribution can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of funds at time with logarithmic size @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the total number of funds at time @xmath5 . to simplify the analysis we solve separately for the total number of funds @xmath11 and for the number density @xmath8 .",
    "as we will argue in section  [ section_empiric_justification ] , the total number of funds as a function of time can be modeled as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rate of creating new funds and @xmath14 is the exit rate of existing funds . under the assumption that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants",
    "this has the solution @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a unit step function at @xmath17 , the year in which the first funds enter .",
    "this solution has the surprising property that the dynamics only depend on the fund exit rate @xmath14 , with a characteristic timescale @xmath18 .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 , as estimated in section  [ section_empiric_justification ] , the timescale for @xmath11 to reach its steady state is only roughly a decade .",
    "an examination of table  [ table ] makes it clear , however , that @xmath20 is not a very good approximation .",
    "nonetheless , if we crudely use the mean creation rate @xmath21 from table  [ table ] and the fund exit rate @xmath19 estimated in section  [ section_empiric_justification ] , the steady state number of funds should be about @xmath22 , compared to the @xmath23 funds that actually existed in 2005 .",
    "thus this gives an estimate with the right order of magnitude .",
    "the important point to stress is that the dynamics for @xmath11 operate on a different timescale than that of @xmath24 . as we will show in the next section the characteristic timescale for @xmath24 is much longer than that for @xmath11 .",
    "we define and solve the time evolution equation for the number density @xmath8 .",
    "the empirical justification for the hypotheses of the model will be given in section  [ section_empiric_justification ] .",
    "the hypotheses are :    * the entry process is a poisson process with rate @xmath13 , such that at time @xmath5 a new fund enters the industry with a probability @xmath25 and ( log ) size @xmath9 drawn from a distribution @xmath26 .",
    "we approximate the entry size distribution as a log - normal distribution in the fund size @xmath4 , that is a normal distribution in @xmath9 given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean log size of new funds and @xmath29 is its variance .",
    "@xmath30 is a unit step function ensuring no funds funds enter the industry before the initial time @xmath31 . *",
    "the exit process is a poisson process such that at any time time @xmath5 a fund exits the industry with a size independent probability @xmath32 . *",
    "the size change is approximated as a ( log ) brownian motion with a size dependent drift and diffusion term @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an i.i.d random variable drawn from a zero mean and unit variance normal distribution .    under these assumptions",

    "the first term on the right describes the entry process , the second describes the fund exit process and the third and fourth terms describe the change in size of a existing funds .",
    "to finish the model it is necessary to specify the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    ". in the large size limit the returns @xmath42 dominate , and thus it is reasonable to treat @xmath49 as a constant , @xmath50 .",
    "market efficiency also implies that in the large size limit the standard deviation @xmath51 is a constant , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "otherwise investors would be able to improve their risk adjusted returns by simply investing in larger funds .    with these approximations",
    "the evolution equation becomes @xmath53 in this and subsequent equations , to keep things simple we use the notation @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the exit process is particularly important , since it is responsible for thickening the upper tail of the distribution .",
    "the intuition is as follows : since each fund exits the industry with the same probability , and since there are more small funds than large funds , more small funds exit the industry .",
    "this results in relatively more large funds , making the distribution heavy - tailed . as we will now show this results in the distribution evolving from a log - normal upper tail to a power law upper tail .",
    "in contrast , the entry process is not important for determining the shape of the distribution , and influences only the total number of funds @xmath56 .",

    "a key point is that we are not fitting these parameters on the target data for fund size , but rather are fitting them on the individual entry , exit and diffusion processes and then simulating the corresponding model to predict fund size .",

    "the deviations between the prediction and the data are thus very likely due to chance  many of the individual runs of the simulation deviate from the mean of the 1000 simulations more than the empirical data does .",
    "we have argued that the mutual fund size distribution is driven by market efficiency , which gives rise to a random growth process .",
    "the essential elements of the growth process are multiplicative random changes in the size of existing funds , entry of new funds , and exit of existing funds as they go out of business .",
    "we find , however , that entry plays no role at all other than setting the scale ; exit plays a small role in thickening the tails of the distribution , but this acts only on a very slow timescale .",
    "the log - normality comes about because the industry is young and still in a transient state , and the exit process has not had a sufficient time to act . in the future ,",
    "if the conditions for fund growth and exit were to remain stationary for more than a century , the distribution would become a power law .",
    "the thickening of the tails happens from the body of the distribution outward , as the power law tail extends to successively larger funds .",
    "we suspect that the conditions are highly unlikely to remain this stationary , and that the fund size distribution will remain indefinitely in its current log - normal , out of equilibrium state .",
    "there is also an interesting size dependence in the growth rate of mutual fund size , which is both like and unlike that of other types of firms .",
    "mutual funds are distinctive in that their overall growth rates can be decomposed as a sum of two terms , @xmath106 , where @xmath48 represents the flow of money in and out of funds , and @xmath42 the returns on money that is already in the fund .",
    "the money flow @xmath48 decreases as a power law as a function of size , similar to what is widely observed in the overall growth rates for other types of firms .",
    "furthermore the exponents are similar to those observed elsewhere .",
    "the returns @xmath42 , in contrast , are essentially independent of fund size , as they must be under market efficiency . as a result , for large sizes",
    "the mean and variance of the overall growth are constant  this is unlike other firms , for which the mean and variance appear to go to zero in the limit . as we discuss here , this makes a difference in the long - term evolution : while the exit process is driving mutual funds to evolve toward a heavier - tailed distribution , other firms are evolving toward a thinner - tailed distribution . again , though , due to the extremely slow relaxation times , we suspect this makes little or no difference .",
    "our analysis here suggests that the details of investor preference have a negligible influence on the upper tail of the mutual fund size distribution , except insofar as investors choose funds so as to enforce market efficiency .",
    "investor preference enters our analysis only through @xmath48 , the flow of money in and out of the fund .",
    "since @xmath48 becomes relatively small in the large size limit , the growth of large funds is dominated by the returns @xmath42 , whose mean and variance are constant .",
    "thus the upper tail of the size distribution is determined by market efficiency , which dictates both that returns are essentially random , and thus diffusive , and that there is no dependence on size . as a result , for large fund size investor preference does nt have much influence on the growth process .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that the statistical properties of the money flux @xmath48 are essentially like those of the growth of other firms .",
    "how can size - dependent transaction costs be compatible with our results here ?",
    "we have performed an empirical study , which we will report elsewhere , that demonstrates that as size increases fund managers maintain constant after - transaction cost performance by lowering fees , reducing trading and diversifying investments .",
    "this is in contrast to the theory proposed by berk and green ( @xcite ) that fund size is determined by the skill of fund managers , i.e. that better managers attract more investment until increased transaction cost causes excess returns to disappear . both our theory and that of berk and green are based on market efficiency .",
    "the key difference is that we find that the flatness of performance vs. size is enforced by simple actions taken by fund managers that do not influence the diffusion of fund size .",
    "in contrast , the berk and green theory requires choices by investors that directly influence fund size , and thus is not compatible with the free diffusion that we have prevented empirical evidence for here . in their theory transaction costs and investor skill determine fund size ; in our theory , neither plays a role .",
    "we would like to stress that , while we are fitting econometric models to the entry , exit and growth processes , and calibrating these models against the data , we are not fitting any parameters on the size data itself .",
    "this makes it challenging to get a model that fits as well as the model shown in fig .",
    "[ simv2 ] . of course",
    ", we have only demonstrated that the random process model is sufficient to explain fund size ; we can not demonstrate that other explanations might not also be able to explain it .",
    "however , the assumptions that we make here are simple and natural .",
    "the stochastic nature of fund growth is not surprising : it is well known that past returns do not predict future returns . thus even if investors chase returns , they are chasing something that is inherently random .",
    "we believe that this is at the core of why our model works so well .",
    "our demonstration that a good explanation can be obtained based on market efficiency alone , which requires weaker assumptions than full rationality , provides a theory that is robust and largely independent of the details of human choice .",

    "naively one would therefore expect that the gini coefficient of the pareto distribution ( see footnote 18 ) to be larger than that of a lognormal since it has a heavier upper tail .",
    "this is true for a pareto distribution with @xmath127 , for which the gini coefficient is one due to the fact that the standard deviation does not exist .",
    "however , when @xmath127 , for large standard deviations the gini coefficient of the log - normal is greater than that of the pareto , as shown in figure  [ fig : gini ] .",
    "in order to compare apples to apples in figure  [ fig : gini ] we plot the gini coefficient as a function of the standard deviation ( which is a function of the distribution parameters ) . for a pareto distribution with a finite second moment ( @xmath128 )",
    "the lognormal has a higher coefficient .",
    "thus , even though the gini coefficient is frequently used as measure for inequality , it is not a good measure when one seeks to study tail properties , particularly for comparisons of distributions with different functional representations .",
    "the reason is that the gini coefficient is a property of the whole distribution , and depends on the shape of the body as well as the tail .",
