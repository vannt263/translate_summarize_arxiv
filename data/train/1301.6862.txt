    "it has been well known that the standard lowest order conforming elements can produce numerical locking and checker - board solutions in the approximation of solid and fluid mechanics problems : see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "an efficient approach to deal with this case is to employ the nonconforming element method , which has made a great impact on the development of finite element methods @xcite .    to approximate pdes using a nonconforming element of order @xmath2 , one needs to impose the continuity of the moments up to order @xmath3 of the functions across all the interfaces of neighboring elements .",
    "this condition is known as the patch test @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the patch test is equivalent to the continuity at the @xmath2 gauss points located on each interface .",
    "this implies that a @xmath4-nonconforming element , if exists , must be continuous at the @xmath2 gauss points on each edge .",
    "these points ( completed with internal points for @xmath5 ) can be used to define local lagrange degrees of freedom ( dofs ) on the simplex if @xmath2 is odd , but this construction is not possible if @xmath2 is even since there exists a lower - degree polynomial vanishing at all the gauss points @xcite . thus suitable bubble functions are often employed to enrich the finite element space . until now",
    ", the triangular nonconforming elements are well studied in the literature ( see , @xcite ) , but the analysis of their quadrilateral counterparts is less complete .    even though the triangular or tetrahedral meshes are popular to use , in some cases where the geometry of the problem has a quadrilateral nature , one wishes to use quadrilateral or hexahedral meshes with proper elements . for even @xmath2 ,",
    "the same trouble exists , that is , there also exists a lower - degree polynomial vanishing at all the gauss points .",
    "again , some bubble functions are added to the finite element space @xcite . compared to the triangular case ,",
    "another trouble for quadrilateral finite element is that the dofs and corresponding polynomial space do not match .",
    "usually the number of dofs is bigger than the dimension of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the numbers of dofs are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , while the corresponding dimensions of @xmath4 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "therefore , some additional relations must be imposed or some special functions are added to the finite element space such that unisolvency can be satisfied , see @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to develop a @xmath12-nonconforming element on rectangular meshes .",
    "we define the 12 gauss points ( 3 gauss points on every edge ) as the dofs . to obtain an optimal order error estimate , the finite element space",
    "must be carefully chosen such that any function in this space is a polynomial of degree no greater than 3 on every edge .",
    "meanwhile , we also notice that the values on the 12 gauss points satisfy a linear relation if the degree of a polynomial on every edge is no more 3 , which is a little different from the triangular mesh case .",
    "thus we define our finite element space as @xmath13 . therefore , the number of dofs is locally 11 .",
    "we prove unisolvency and define three types of local and global bases , one of which is defined associated with vertices and the other two of which are defined associated with edges .",
    "then we derive optimal error estimates for second - order elliptic problems in broken energy- and @xmath14-norms .",
    "finally , numerical examples are provided , which match our theoretical result very well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the @xmath12 nonconforming element is defined on rectangular meshes .",
    "the dimensions and basis functions for dirichlet and neumann problems are given . in section 3",
    "interpolation operators are defined and optimal order error estimates are shown . in section 4 , numerical results for the elliptic problems are presented .",

    "the following relationship holds : @xmath27 [ lem : relation1 ]    let @xmath28 then any fourth order difference quotient of @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "the fourth order difference quotient of @xmath29 at points @xmath30 , and @xmath31 can be expressed by @xmath32 a simple computation derives the desired result .    as an immediate consequence of lemma [ lem : relation1 ] , we have the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : relation ] the following relationship holds : @xmath33    notice that @xmath34 is a polynomial of degree no greater than 3 on any edge of @xmath24 .",
    "the result follows immediately from lemma [ lem : relation1 ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 vanishes at the twelve gauss points @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37 in @xmath24 .",
    "[ lem : unisolvency ]    let @xmath38 vanish at vanishes at the twelve gauss points @xmath36 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath39 vanishes at the eight gauss points @xmath40 . by",
    "a simple polynomial division , @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 take the following form : @xmath45 all the coefficients @xmath46 are yet to be determined .",
    "it follows from @xmath47 that @xmath48 which implies that @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , if follows from @xmath50 that @xmath51 next , it follows from @xmath52 that @xmath53 since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are polynomials of degree no more 3 , which leads to @xmath56 .",
    "hence @xmath41 must have the following form @xmath57 then the four additional conditions @xmath58 lead to @xmath59 , which completes the proof .    due to proposition [ prop : relation ] and lemma [ lem : unisolvency ] , we have the unisolvency result .",

    "obviously , @xmath62 is one of three gauss points on @xmath63th edge and hence the other two gauss points on @xmath63th edge can also be denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : rec ] , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",

    "we are now in a position to state the definition of @xmath12-nonconforming element on a rectangle as follows .",
    "the @xmath12-nonconforming element on rectangle is defined by @xmath78 , where    * @xmath24 is a rectangle , * @xmath79 is the finite element space , and * @xmath80 } is the degrees of freedom .",
    "the following patch test lemma is immediate since any @xmath81 is of degree @xmath82 on an edge .",
    "[ lem : orth ] let @xmath83 denote the face containing the midpoint @xmath62 and the other two gauss points @xmath64 and @xmath84 if @xmath85 @xmath86 , then @xmath87 for all @xmath88    for actual computation , the local finite element can be alternatively given by \\{@xmath89)}.    in theory , if @xmath90 is replaced by @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 , the unisolvency like proposition [ prop : unisolvency ] holds .",
    "but the former two choices are lack in symmetry . as for the third choice @xmath93",
    ", it turns out to be numerically during the computation of the bases since the corresponding coefficient matrices are nearly ill - conditioned ( the determinants are near to zero ) .",
    "let us proceed to define our @xmath12-nonconforming element space .",
